Alturas County, Logan County's parent county, was Idaho Territory's most politically powerful county in 1889, with 1/6th of all legislators residing within the county to include the lower House Chairman, Mr. H.Z. Burkhart of Hailey. Burkhart naturally opposed an effort to create Logan and Elmore counties from the southern and western portion of Alturas County. Other members of the legislature ultimately were successful in passing the counties' organic legislation on February 7, 1889. Burkhart and J.P. Clough, Legislative Council President from Lemhi County, separately challenged the legality of the act creating Logan County, contending that a group of legislators from both houses reconvened after adjournment in an effort to pass the legislation. Their opponents contended that the gentlemen vacated their positions prior to adjournment, resulting in the selection of new leaders for both the House and Legislative Council. The Supreme Court of Idaho Territory ruled against the gentlemen and the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the ruling on appeal.\n\nThe creation of Logan County clearly marked a significant transition of political power going into the Statehood era. In the 1890 census, Logan County had an enumerated population of 4,169 across 16 precincts and Elmore County had 1,870 residents across 11 precincts, leaving Alturas with 2,620 residents across 15 precincts. Had the 1889 controversy been settled in favor of Alturas, it would have had 8,659 residents across 42 precincts and would have ranked as the 3rd most populous county behind Bingham and Latah counties.\n\nShoshone, in present day Lincoln County was established as the temporary county seat by the 1889 statute. Later, Bellevue was selected as the county seat with only a majority of votes at the October 1, 1890 general election. County residents in Shoshone unsuccessfully challenged the validity of the election to the Idaho Supreme Court, claiming a 2/3 majority was required by the Idaho Constitution.\n\nThe legislature again furthered the controversy on March 7, 1891 when it abolished Alturas and Logan counties, created Lincoln and Alta counties, and established Hailey and Shoshone as county seats. The Idaho Supreme Court ruled the act unconstitutional on June 3, 1891. This effectively restored Alturas and Logan counties with county seats at Bellevue and Hailey.\n\nFinally, on March 5, 1895, the legislature succeeded at what it attempted to do in 1891 by combining Logan and Alturas Counties into a new county called Blaine with its county seat at Hailey. Two weeks later on March 18, Lincoln County was created from the southern portion of Blaine County, containing the exact boundary and county seat established in 1891. The Idaho Supreme Court again weighed in on the matter in 1896. This time, it held the creation of Blaine County to be constitutional, finalizing the abolishment of Logan County effective from the creation date of Blaine County.\n\n\n"}

Originally built as a merchant ship in 1650, and later the Royal Navy ketch HMS \"Nonsuch\", the vessel was sold to Sir William Warren in 1667. The name means \"none such\", i.e. \"unequalled\". The ship was at the time considered smaller than many others but was specifically selected because of her small size so that when she arrived in Hudson Bay and James Bay she could be sailed up-river and taken out of water so the thick ice of the bay wouldn't crush her.\n\nA replica of the original \"Nonsuch\" was commissioned by the HBC to celebrate their tercentenary in 1970. She was crafted using tools and materials familiar to the seventeenth century. She was built by J. Hinks and Son shipyard, in Appledore, Devon, England and was crafted to be as close as possible to the original and featured many of the features ships of the time would have had such as \"hiding cabins\" (small bunks hidden within a cupboard). The vessel has peg board used for tracking position and speed, a charlie noble (a chimney with a mobile head). Like the original she was armed; the replica carries six 2-pounder muzzle-loading smoothbore guns. As with most ships of the era she was very ornate carrying many carvings that took months to complete. When completed, \"Nonsuch\" replica was placed on the MV \"Halifax City\", owned by Charles Hills of Bristol, and carried to Canada. There \"Nonsuch\" sailed down the Atlantic coast of Canada and the United States. She also sailed through the Great Lakes and then was placed on a semi-trailer and taken to Seattle for a voyage down the Pacific coast. She was presented by the HBC to the citizens of Manitoba and placed on permanent display in 1973 in the Nonsuch Gallery at the Manitoba Museum in Winnipeg, Manitoba (then called the Manitoba Museum of Man and Nature). Built specifically for the ship, it is a 90-foot gallery giving the feel of a seventeenth-century scene to visitors and shows the ship at the English port of Deptford, just before embarking on her journey to Hudson Bay.\n\n"}

She is a sacred prostitute who plays a significant role in bringing the wild man Enkidu into contact with civilization.\n\nShamhat plays the integral role in Tablet I, of taming the wild man Enkidu, who was created by the gods as the rival to the mighty Gilgamesh. Shamhat was a sacred temple prostitute or \"harimtu\". She was asked to use her attractiveness to tempt Enkidu from the wild, and his 'wildness', civilizing him through continued sexual intercourse. She was brought to a water source where Enkidu had been spotted and exposed herself to Enkidu. He enjoyed Shamhat for \"six days and seven nights\" (a fragment found in 2015 and read in 2018, disclosed that they had two weeks of sexual intercourse, with a break spent in discussion about Enkidu's future life in Uruk). Unfortunately for Enkidu, after this long sexual workshop in civility, his former companions, the wild animals, turned away from him in fright, at the watering hole where they congregated. Shamhat persuades him to follow her and join the civilized world in the city of Uruk, where Gilgamesh is king, rejecting his former life in the wild with the wild animals of the hills. Henceforth, Gilgamesh and Enkidu become the best of friends and undergo many adventures (starting with the Cedar Forest and the encounter with Humbaba.)\n\nWhen Enkidu is dying he expresses his anger at Shamhat for making him civilized, blaming her for bringing him to the new world of experiences that has led to his death. He curses her to become an outcast. The god Shamash reminds Enkidu that Shamhat fed and clothed him. Enkidu relents and blesses her saying that all men will desire her and offer her gifts of jewels.\n\nShamhat's name means literally \"the luscious one\". Her role in bringing Enkidu from nature to civilization through sex has been widely discussed. Rivkah Harris argues that \"the intermediate role of the prostitute in transforming Enkidu from one at home with nature and wild animals into a human being is crucial\". According to classicist Paul Friedrich, Shamhat's sexual skills establish \"the connection between artful, or sophisticated sensuousness and civilization\". Her sexual arts lead Enkidu to understand how basic animal urges can be transformed into something sophisticated, or \"civilized\". Mesopotamians believed that prostitution was one of the basic features of civilization: \"a prime representative of urban life\". Shamhat then becomes Enkidu's urbane \"mother\", teaching him the basics of civilized life, eating, drinking wine, and dressing himself.\n"}

Momentum is the absolute difference in stock, commodity:\n\nRate of change scales by the old close, so as to represent the increase as a fraction,\n\n\"\"Momentum\"\" in general refers to prices continuing to trend. The momentum and ROC indicators show trend by remaining positive while an uptrend is sustained, or negative while a downtrend is sustained.\n\nA crossing up through zero may be used as a signal to buy, or a crossing down through zero as a signal to sell. How high (or how low when negative) the indicators get shows how strong the trend is.\n\nThe way momentum shows an absolute change means it shows for instance a $3 rise over 20 days, whereas ROC might show that as 0.25 for a 25% rise over the same period. One can choose between looking at a move in dollar terms, relative point terms, or proportional terms. The zero crossings are the same in each, of course, but the highs or lows showing strength are on the respective different bases.\n\nThe conventional interpretation is to use momentum as a trend-following indicator. This means that when the indicator peaks and begins to descend, it can be considered a sell signal. The opposite conditions can be interpreted when the indicator bottoms out and begins to rise. Momentum signals (e.g., 52-week high) have been shown to be used by financial analysts in their buy and sell recommendations.\n\nMomentum is the change in an N-day simple moving average (SMA) between yesterday and today, with a scale factor N+1, i.e.\n\nThis is the slope or steepness of the SMA line, like a derivative. This relationship is not much discussed generally, but it's of interest in understanding the signals from the indicator.\n\nWhen momentum crosses up through zero it corresponds to a trough in the SMA, and when it crosses down through zero it's a peak. How high (or low) momentum gets represents how steeply the SMA is rising (or falling).\n\nThe TRIX indicator is similarly based on changes in a moving average (a triple exponential in that case).\n\nThe relationship between different moving average trading rules is explained in the paper \"Anatomy of Market Timing with Moving Averages\". Specifically, in this paper the author demonstrates that every trading rule can be presented as a weighted average of the momentum rules computed using different averaging periods.\n"}
{"id": "1813583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1813583", "title": "Nonsuch (album)", "text": "Nonsuch (album)\n\nNonsuch (styled as NONSVCH.) is the 12th studio album by the English band XTC, released 27 April 1992 on Virgin Records. The follow-up to \"Oranges & Lemons\" (1989), \"Nonsuch\" is a relatively less immediate and more restrained sounding album, carrying the band's psychedelic influences into new musical styles. The LP received critical acclaim, charted at number 28 in the UK Albums Chart, and number 97 on the US \"Billboard 200\", as well as topping \"Rolling Stone\"'s College album chart.\n\nProduced by Gus Dudgeon, 13 of the album's 17 tracks were written by guitarist/leader Andy Partridge, with the rest by bassist Colin Moulding, while Dave Mattacks of Fairport Convention was recruited on drums. Unlike previous XTC albums, Partridge composed many of his songs using a keyboard. Due to the album's lyric content, which covers topics ranging from love and humanity to the Gulf War and P. T. Barnum, \"Nonsuch\" has been described as the band's darkest and most political album. The cover depicts an illustration of the former Nonsuch Palace, chosen after the band had settled on the title \"nonesuch\", which Partridge felt summed up the album's variety of music. It was their third double album when issued on vinyl.\n\nLead single \"The Disappointed\" reached number 33 in the UK and was nominated for an Ivor Novello award, while \"The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead\" was the band's second single to top the US Modern Rock Tracks, later becoming a UK top 40 hit when covered by the Canadian band Crash Test Dummies. XTC soon left Virgin Records in the UK following a dispute over the cancelled third single, \"Wrapped in Grey\". \"Nonsuch\" was also nominated for the 1993 Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. In 2013, a remixed and expanded version of the album was released. Mixed by Steven Wilson, the edition included new stereo, surround sound and instrumental mixes of the original album along with various demos and outtakes.\n\nAfter the band's double album \"Oranges & Lemons\" (1989) was released to acclaim from music critics and modest commercial success, XTC took a short break. Band leader Andy Partridge produced \"And Love For All\" (1989), the second album by The Lilac Time, while also compering for an unbroadcast children's game show named \"Matchmakers\", and Dave Gregory played for Johnny Hates Jazz, Marc Almond and Francesco Messina whilst also producing for Cud, while Colin Moulding performed a special event concert with David Marx and the Refugees, a Swindon-based band that reunited him with former XTC member Barry Andrews. The band soon reunited and began writing their next, tenth album, the soon-to-become \"Nonsuch\", determined to record their new compositions in their native England, as recording \"Oranges & Lemons\" in Los Angeles had made the band absent from their families back in England.\n\nHaving written some 32 songs for \"Nonsuch\" by 1991, it nonetheless took some time for the album to get off the ground. Initially, the band had issue with the musical director of their label Virgin Records, who, after seeing 32 songs written for \"Nonsuch\", was convinced the band \"could do better\" and asked them to write other songs. Band leader Andy Partridge reflected: \"We were ready [to record the album in 1990], but our English record company refused all our songs.\" In Partridge's recollection, the director threatened that Virgin would drop the band if the band don't write an album \"of twelve Top Ten guaranteed singles,\" and noted that this attitude held the band up in recording \"Nonsuch\", which they refused to rewrite, believing its songs to be among the greatest they had written. With the band sitting on the material, the director left the label a year later, and his replacement liked the band's content, hurrying the band to record the album.\n\nThe band's initial choice of producers for the album were not available; they pursued Steve Lillywhite and Hugh Padgham, both of whom the band worked with before, to co-produce the album, but Lillywhite was unavailable due a holiday with his wife Kirsty MacColl and Padgham did not want to produce the album alone, while the band found that hiring John Paul Jones as producer would be too expensive, and a deal to work with Bill Bottrell, who had recently worked on \"Dangerous\" (1991) by Michael Jackson, fell through. With Partridge becoming so desperate to record \"Nonsuch\" that he \"would have done it with the window cleaner,\" eccentric English producer Gus Dudgeon was the band's final choice, having been enticed by his work with the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band. He produced the album, recorded at Chipping Norton Recording Studios, Oxfordshire, between July and October 1991.\n\nWhen Dudgeon arrived in the studio and Partridge saw his attire and expensive lifestyle, he felt \"he was wrong [for the job], but by that time it was difficult to go back.\" The band nicknamed him Guff Dungeon \"because he was so flatulent.\" Partridge reflected: \"Gus is old school, full of blusters and bluff [mimicking Dudgeon] 'Elton gave me this Rolls-Royce and I said, 'Oh Elton darling...'\" Dudgeon had heard of the tense relationship between Partridge and producer Todd Rundgren during the \"Skylarking\" sessions, and \"had come in armed with a heavy supply for vitriol;\" Partridge, meanwhile, started to compare his relationship with Dudgeon to Rundgren, especially after Dudgeon suggested removing one of Partridge's favourite songs on the album, \"Rook\", though the recording sessions were civil and the two regularly exchanged banter. Dudgeon reportedly kept a tape of him and Partridge joking in the sessions and played it to party guests. Nonetheless, Partridge later commented that \"ultimately he wasn't the right producer for us.\"\n\nAt Gregory's suggestion, Dave Mattacks of Fairport Convention played drums on the album. When discussing \"what drummer, as a fantasy, [the band] would really like to work with,\" Mattacks was top of the band's list. The same week, a friend of the band saw him perform live with Fairport Convention and brought XTC back a tour programme, in which Mattacks stated Joni Mitchell and XTC were the artists he would most like to drum for. Partridge, speaking to Bob Harris in a radio interview, commented that he \"just had to get on the phone to him straight away.\" Mattacks agreed to appear on the album because of the band's personality and the quality of the songs, and later reflected that although it was challenging fitting into the band, it was not difficult, elaborating that \"the experience was enjoyable. Great songs.\" Meanwhile, Partridge felt that Dave Gregory improved at arranging musical structures during the sessions. During recording of the album, Moulding and Gregory \"found themselves working at a car rental spot to sustain themselves between royalty checks.\"\n\nThe album was mixed at Rockfield Studios, South Wales in November and December 1991. The mixing was due to be done by Dudgeon who instructed Partridge not to attend, but Partridge insisted he would appear anyway. At the studios, Dudgeon refuted suggestions from Partridge concerning the mix and insisted he mix the album as he desired. This was at odds with engineer Barry Hammond, who had listened to Partridge's suggestions. Both Partridge and Virgin Records were vocal in their dissatisfaction with the first three mixes that Dudgeon had created, with one Virgin executive even comparing one such mix to \"ice blasts\"; as a result, Dudgeon was subsequently fired, with Nick Davis, who had just finished mixing \"We Can't Dance\" by Genesis, being hired to mix the final version of \"Nonsuch\", which he did in a comparatively fast space of two and a half weeks. The album was mastered by Bob Ludwig at Masterdisk, New York.\n\nThe detailed sound of \"Nonsuch\" retains parts of the psychedelic flourishes that defined the band's late 1980s work, except here \"integrated into an elaborate, lush pop setting that falls somewhere between \"Skylarking\" and \"Oranges & Lemons\",\" according to critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic. Similarly, David Quantick of \"Vox\" found it to continue the jangle rock of the aforesaid albums. Compared to \"Oranges & Lemons\", Partridge described \"Nonsuch\" as being less immediate and simpler sounding: \"It's not as immediate, and that's the way we want it.\" Noting the album's eclecticism, music critic Greg Kot considered the album \"a mix of Broadway pomp, McCartneyesque sing-song, lilting melodies, delightful odes to everyday pleasures and humbling introspection,\" while T.J. McGrath of \"Dirty Linen\" said \"Nonsuch\" \"studiously explores jazz-fusion (\"That Wave\"), folk-rock (\"Then She Appeared\"), soundtrack muzak (\"Bungalow\"), cowboy punk (\"Crocodile\"), psychedelic-power swirl (\"Humble Daisy\"), and classical sad ballad (\"Rook\").\" Guitar and keyboard textures on the album regularly shift, and strings, horns and piano are included in the album's instrumentation in a fashion that has been compared to the Beach Boys.\n\nThirteen of the songs are written by Partridge, with the remaining four written by Colin Moulding. In Isler's opinion, Partridge's songs are concerned with themes such as \"love, politics and the human comedy,\" and noting songs which \"[blur] these topical boundaries,\" while the \"NME\" noted lyrics about omnibuses, orchards and miscreants. Roger Friedman of \"Details\" noted lyrical content ranging from book burning, the Gulf War and P.T. Barnum and felt the album was a song cycle, while, citing themes of sad retirement in \"Bungalow\" and maddening alienation in \"Rook\", Martin Townsend of \"Vox\" called the album \"precisely of its time,\" feeling it to reflect \"the mental and physical landscape of the [then-current] recession,\" and felt it was arguably the band's darkest album. It has also been cited as the band's most political album. Unlike previous XTC albums, Partridge composed many of his songs on \"Nonsuch\" using the keyboard, an instrument Partridge referred to as \"this grinning shark; stroke its teeth and any minute it'll swallow you up.\" He said he was so unfamiliar with the keyboard that he played it \"by drumming on it, two fingers here, two fingers there.\"\n\n\"The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead\" is \"relatively rocking\" compared to most of the album, and has been called a \"shaggy-dog story.\" It was inspired by a pumpkin that Partridge carved for Halloween, which he decided not to dispose after the Halloween celebrations, and watched as it decomposed in his back garden. He immortalised it in the song, a ballad concerning a perfect, honest person with a pumpkin for a head and about \"how perfect we all could be, and how scared people are of truth.\" Moulding's first song on the album, \"My Bird Performs,\" is \"a metaphor for feeling good about how life's going.\" He explained: \"I hadn't got fond memories of my thirties and naivety got me through my twenties, but as I came closer to my forties it all started to come clear and this, I suppose, was the start of that awakening in me.\" It took a whole night to loop Mattacks' intricate drum shuffle into the four minute song.\n\n\"Dear Madam Barnum\" was written for, but unused by the Australian film \"The Crossing\" and is intended to sound like 1965, the year the film was set. Also intended to possess a \"circus orchestra feel,\" Partridge and Mattacks took careful attention in writing the rhythmic feel for the song. The song has a traditional structure, but although Partridge wanted Mattacks to play \"a real straight backbeat,\" he also asked he \"put a little skip-and-drag in there that fell somewhere between dotted [time] and straight, because we both agreed that we liked the tension where you get dotted vs. straight, and straight vs. dotted.\" Mattacks used one of 50 special snare drums he owned for the song, while Gregory incorporates numerous subtle guitar arpeggios and a Hammond organ-based bridge.\n\nDescribed by band biographer Neville Farmer as \"a piece of near-Stratospheric psychedelia,\" \"Humble Daisy\" features multiple key changes and what Farmer perceives to be references to the Beach Boys and the Lovin' Spoonful in a musical structure Partridge described as \"a piece of dream logic.\" Written by Moulding, \"The Smartest Monkeys\" was described by Johan Kugelberg of \"Spin\" as \"the kind of social commentary that can only be born in a pub,\" and features jangley guitars. \"The Disappointed\" concerns itself with people who have been turned down romantically and come together to form an organisation \"of the disappointed,\" while \"Holly Up on Poppy\" is about Partridge's daughter Holly, Poppy being the name of the rocking horse she had. In writing the song, Partridge hoped to avoid the saccharine nature he felt plagued songs with similar subjects. \"Crocodile\" features what appears to be crocodile noises, but are in fact a sample of a tuned down pig's grunt.\n\nPartridge suddenly wrote \"Rook\", one of his favourite songs on the album, after a period of writer's block: \"I was really frightened. I mean, I couldn't even finish the demo because I was in tears. It felt like seeing yourself in a mirror and recognising your own mortality. Maybe it's something in the chord changes.\" Featuring piano playing, strings and horns, it has been compared to classical music. Though Partridge said he did not understand the lyrics, which he found \"exciting,\" the lyrics concern death and the cycle of life. \"Vox\" called it a powerful picture of \"alienation verging on madness\", while Isler said that, \"with impressionistic piano block chords and yearning, dreamy lyric, it is simply an art song.\"\n\"Omnibus\", with an offbeat rhythm, is praiseful of women. Partridge wrote: \"I love women in every way, shape and form. If that's sexist, then nail me up. I worship at the church of women. The world would be a better place if it were just women and me.\" Musically, the song was intended as a pastiche on West End musicals. \"That Wave\" combines Partridge's fear of water and the subject of love \"into the sensation of drowning in a wave of love.\" Moulding described the song's music as a \"psychedelic grenade.\" \"Then She Appeared\" originated when Partridge wrote it as a Dukes of Stratosphear-style track, intending to release as one of two songs on a seven-inch flexidisc covermount into a music magazine while using a secret pseudonym preporting to be an unknown 1960s band, sharing musical similarities with the other track, \"Goodbye Humanosaurus\", which the band rehearsed for \"Nonsuch\" but ultimately did not use.\n\nMoulding's \"War Dance\" originated in 1983 for the \"Mummer\" sessions in the aftermath of the Falklands War, but Moulding would change the track drastically for its version on \"Nonsuch\", recorded after the Gulf War which gave the song a new poignancy. The song features a synthesized clarinet that Partridge later dismissed as sounding \"like a singing penis.\" \"Wrapped in Grey\" is about tapping into one's emotions in order to realise life \"isn't all grey,\" while \"The Ugly Underneath\" concerns itself with politicians. Moulding wrote \"Bungalow\" and described its musical style as being \"[v]ery seaside-y and cheesy organ, like something a cruddy trio in [a] holiday camp might play.\" It was inspired by his childhood holidays to Weymouth and is a tribute to British seaside holidays, featuring a Welsh male voice choir added by Gregory. Partridge considers the song to be the best song Moulding had written. An anti-censorship song, \"Books are Burning\" was inspired by the G–E7/A chord change from the Beach Boys' \"I Get Around\" (1964) while the lyrics were based on Salman Rushdie and the religious controversy surrounding his work.\n\nPartridge selected the name of the album after encountering a drawing of the former Nonsuch Palace in Surrey and, thinking that the archaic word \"Nonsuch\" meant \"does not exist\" rather than, as he later learned, \"unique\". Other proposed names for the album were \"Balloon\", which Partridge thought was \"a lovely, round word\" which \"evokes associations with related traveling\", \"The Last Balloon Ride Home\" and \"Milkfloat\". Partridge said of the final title: \"It is a very beautiful word, but also one of my favorite record companies, the American record company Nonesuch, which releases this old music I like a lot. I then discovered it was the most marvellous castle ever, covered with gold, sculptures and paints, it looked like a fairy tale's wedding cake. It was built by that tyrant, Henry VIII, who razed a village for it. The edifice quickly disappeared, it exists only on two second-rate drawings.\" He felt the album title was a good way to sum up the otherwise disparate content of the album and present them as an entirety, explaining to one interviewer how he picked the title:\nThe album cover features an illustration of the palace, taken from a 1611 map of Surrey by John Speed. Deborah A. Levinson of \"The Tech\" felt that the \"certain formal elegance\" of the Nonsuch Palace illustration and the typeface used in the packaging—a variation of Caslon, albeit with wobbly, uneven letters intended to appear like handwriting—displays a \"gracefulness that nulls the listener, making \"Nonsuch\" sound harmless, when in fact it's XTC's most political album.\" Each song on the album has its own illustration on the back cover. Partridge explained: \"[T]hey call them chapbook drawings, they're supposed to educate children, you know, you gave a pic then you have a word underneath it, and the child is supposed to look at the drawing and copy the word and all that sort of stuff.\"\n\n\"Nonsuch\" was released on 27 April 1992 by Virgin Records in the United Kingdom and by Geffen Records a day later in the United States. In addition to single CD and cassette releases, \"Nonsuch\" was released as a double vinyl in the UK but not in the US. It reached number 28 on the UK Albums Chart, becoming their second consecutive and final Top 40 album, although it only stayed on the chart for two weeks. Comparatively, the album spent eleven weeks on the US \"Billboard\" 200, where it peaked at number 97. The album also reached number one on the \"Rolling Stone\" College album chart, at the time a significant feat, and number 75 in the Australian ARIA Charts. Music critic Nick Reed described its minor commercial success as \"business as usual for the band.\"\n\nThe album produced two singles, the first of which was \"The Disappointed\", which reached number 33 on the UK Singles Chart, and became nominated for an Ivor Novello Award in 1993. The second single \"The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead\" reached number 71 in the UK. \"Wrapped in Grey\" was intended as the third single in September 1992, but was withdrawn by Virgin immediately as they did not think it would be commercially successful. Ultimately 1,000 CD copies were pressed and it was the band's final single before leaving Virgin. Partridge reflected: \"It was the great cot-death single – they pressed it and then changed their minds, such a shame.\" Promotional videos for all three songs were made, with the \"Peter Pumpkinhead\" video receiving much airplay on MTV that summer; the band also performed \"Books Are Burning\" live with Mattacks on \"The Late Show\" on BBC Two in April 1992. The album was promoted with music magazine advertisements that featured joke quotes such as \"George Bush doesn't get it\", \"David Duke thinks it contains communist codes\" and \"William Kennedy Smith just wants to know if it gets chicks hot.\" Other advertisements featured the tagline: \"Still Not on Tour (Cheer up, there is a new album)\".\n\n\"Nonsuch\" received acclaim from music critics. Greg Kot of the \"Chicago Tribune\" felt that \"the vast majority of the 17 songs are dazzlers,\" while Michael Azerrad of \"Rolling Stone\" felt that \"\"Nonsuch\" is what happens when three men who grew up on \"Sgt. Pepper\" and \"Pet Sounds\" stay true. Too lovely for college radio, too challenging for legions of baby boomers unwilling to progress, XTC has built itself a very gorgeous golden cage.\" Brent Anderson of \"Sunday Morning Post\" said \"Nonsuch\" is \"a multidimensional feast that shows XTC at its most adept and affecting,\" while Scott Isler of \"Musician\" favourably compared parts of \"Nonsuch\" to the Beach Boys' \"Smiley Smile\" (1967). Terry Staunton of \"NME\" wrote that the record \"would be an improvement to anyone's record shelf [...] another extremely good XTC album with the usual fractured guitar melodies coupled with cute and curious lyrics about what a nice place England is. Oddly enough, it's the Americans who buy most of this stuff.\"\n\nBy contrast, Robert Christgau dismissed the album as a \"dud\" and later remarked that \"[since the band's] idea of a class pop arranger was the same as Elton John's, I figured that if they were feuding with their record company their record company was right.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s Bill Wyman called the album a \"kaleidoscopic, highly intelligent collection of off-kilter pop craft that goes on a bit too long. At its best, however, it’s a witty and engaging \"White Album\"-ish collection of fairy tales and funny stories.\" David Hepworth of \"Q\" wrote that \"\"Nonsuch\" contains 17 dense, melodic, intelligent and occasionally irritating pop songs,\" while commenting that \"[t]he level of XTC's invention is evidenced by the arrangements of the guitars and the layers of backing vocals.\" However, he criticised the album's \"tendency to underscore the lyrical message of tunes like ['War Dance'] which is sometimes tiresome.\" In 1993, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album, but lost to Tom Waits' \"Bone Machine\". Colin Larkin rated the album five stars out of five in \"The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\", and ranked \"The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead\" at number 85 in his list of the 100 best singles ever.\n\nAmong retrospective reviews, Oregano Rathbone of \"Record Collector\" gave the album a perfect score, calling it \"a paragon of peerless songwriting and enchanted, inimitable musicianship.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described \"Nonsuch\" \"modest, minor masterpiece\" and the band's \"most immaculate album to date,\" finding the album's content to be \"carefully composed and crafted.\" David Quantick of \"Q\" reflected that the album was \"very much malt XTC, a fine blend of all their various styles matured to an extraordinary refinement. So no hits then, but 17 excellent songs.\" Writing in 2014, Nick Reed of \"The Quietus\" wrote that \"Nonsuch\" is \"refreshingly more restrained than \"Oranges & Lemons\" was, and holds up a lot better today.\" He elaborated: \"Listening to it today, it feels like XTC realizing that it may be their last chance, and therefore putting everything they've got into making something timeless.\" Conversely, \"The Chicago Reader\"s J.R. Jones dismissed it as \"downright awful, and its album cover, a two-dimensional drawing of a Tudor palace, is an apt illustration for its opaque sound.\" \"Stereogum\"s Robert Ham evaluated the album as the second-worst of the group's discography. He criticised the production's \"digital sheen\" which he thought was most audible in \"poor Dave Mattacks' drums. Each cymbal crash and snare hit appears to be spilling over with ones and zeros.\"\n\nPartridge was pleased with \"Nonsuch\", joking that \"on a scale of 0 to 1, its nearly 1.\" According to \"The Boston Globe\" writer Jim Sullivan, although Partridge pleased with the acclaim the album received, he remained modest about it success. In the seven years following the album's release, XTC went on strike against Virgin Records, partly because of the label's refusal release \"Wrapped in Grey\" as a single, and would not return with new music until the album \"Apple Venus Volume 1\" (1999). Musician John Grant cited \"Nonsuch\" as his favourite XTC album, calling it \"lousy with masterpieces.\" Joe Jackson called \"Nonsuch\" perhaps his favourite XTC album and \"a treasure trove to be dipped into again and again.\"\n\nOn 11 June 2001, Virgin released a new version of \"Nonsuch\", with remastering by Ian Cooper, as part of their XTC remasters series released without input from the band. The original back cover design, reproduced on the back cover of the new remastered edition, was accidentally printed an inch and a half too far to the right. Moulding said of the remasters: \"The whole thing was a shambles. I think the artwork in particular. A lot of it's all wrong, and so badly printed. I think \"Nonsuch\", the whole thing is shifted about an inch-and-a-half one way I think. It's just a complete muck-up. I don't think they really thought too much about it.\"\n\nNew 2.0 stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes from the original \"Nonsuch\" multitracks by Steven Wilson were released by Partridge's label Ape Records on 4 November 2013. It was released as single CD, CD+DVD and CD+Blu-Ray editions, the video disc of the latter two editions including a plethora of bonus material, including a DVD-Audio version of the album, home demos of the songs by Andy Partridge, work tapes of several songs by Colin Moulding and, exclusively to the Blu-Ray edition, a 48-minute \"making of\" documentary documenting the album's recording and the music videos for \"The Disappointed\" and \"The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead\". One notable change with the 2013 versions is that the crossfades between several songs were removed, a decision Wilson persuaded Partridge into allowing.\n\nThe following discounts the alternate 2.0 stereo, 5.1 surround sound, and instrumental mixes included in this edition (each of which duplicate the above running order) as well as the bonus videos.\n\nXTC\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nTechnical\n\nString and brass arrangements by Dave Gregory, except \"Rook\" and \"Omnibus\" by Andy Partridge and \"War Dance\" by Colin Moulding.

He was portrayed as joyful old man.\n\nBaianai in ancient times was the Turkic goddess of wildlife, wealth and fertility. She was worshipped throughout what is now Altai, Sakha and Siberia before Christianity and Islam expanded into the area. Her name means \"rich, fertile, wealthy\". She was the daughter of Kayra.\n\nBaianai is sometimes a woodland fairy or protector spirit found in Turkic-Altaic folklore and mythology. In Central Asia she is known as \"Payna\". There are three Baianais:\n\n\nThe word Baianai has Altaic-Turkic roots with a meaning of \"wealth\", \"richness\", \"grandness\", \"greatness\" and \"divinity\".\n\nBaianai is commonly depicted as ethereal maidens with long loose hair, sometimes also with wings. They are usually dressed in free-flowing gowns, their garments decorated with feathers by means of which they can fly like birds. Baianai is most often described as being a blonde, tall and slender woman with pale, glowing skin and fiery eyes. Baianais are believed to be the very beautiful women, with an affinity to fire. They have the powers to bring about drought, burn a farmer's crops or make cattle die of high fever. It is said that when a Baianai is angered she would change her appearance and turn into a monstrous bird, capable of flinging fire at her enemies.\n\nAccording to folk beliefs, Baianai lives inside huge old trees, in abandoned shacks or dark caves, near rivers, ponds or wells. Baianai come to the human world during only the spring and stay until autumn.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1813588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1813588", "title": "Digital distribution", "text": "Digital distribution\n\nDigital distribution (also referred to as content delivery, online distribution, or electronic software distribution (ESD), among others) is the delivery or distribution of digital media content such as audio, video, e-books, video games, and other software. The term is generally used to describe distribution over an online delivery medium, such as the Internet, thus bypassing physical distribution methods, such as paper, optical discs, and VHS videocassettes. The term online distribution is typically applied to freestanding products; downloadable add-ons for other products are more commonly known as downloadable content. With the advancement of network bandwidth capabilities, online distribution became prominent in the 21st century, with prominent platforms such as Amazon Video, and Netflix's streaming service starting in 2007.\n\nContent distributed online may be streamed or downloaded, and often consists of books, films and television programs, music, software, and video games. Streaming involves downloading and using content at a user's request, or \"on-demand\", rather than allowing a user to store it permanently. In contrast, fully downloading content to a hard drive or other form of storage media may allow offline access in the future.\n\nSpecialist networks known as content delivery networks help distribute content over the Internet by ensuring both high availability and high performance. Alternative technologies for content delivery include peer-to-peer file sharing technologies. Alternatively, content delivery platforms create and syndicate content remotely, acting like hosted content management systems.\n\nUnrelated to the above, the term \"Digital distribution\" is also used in film distribution to describe distribution of content through physical digital media, in opposition to distribution by analog media such as photographic film and magnetic tape (see digital cinema).\n\nA primary characteristic of online distribution is its direct nature. To make a commercially successful work, artists usually must enter their industry's publishing chain. Publishers help artists advertise, fund and distribute their work to retail outlets. In some industries, particularly video games, artists find themselves bound to publishers, and in many cases unable to make the content they want; the publisher might not think it will profit well. This can quickly lead to the standardization of the content and to the stifling of new, potentially risky ideas.\n\nBy opting for online distribution, an artist can get their work into the public sphere of interest easily with potentially minimum business overhead. This often leads to cheaper goods for the consumer, increased profits for the artists, as well as increased artistic freedom. Online distribution platforms often contain or act as a form of digital rights management.\n\nOnline distribution also opens the door to new business models (e.g., the Open Music Model). For instance, an artist could release one track from an album or one chapter from a book at a time instead of waiting for them all to be completed. This either gives them a cash boost to help continue their projects or indicates that their work might not be financially viable. This is hopefully done before they have spent excessive money and time on a project deemed to remain unprofitable. Video games have increased flexibility in this area, demonstrated by micropayment models. A clear result of these new models is their accessibility to smaller artists or artist teams who do not have the time, funds, or expertise to make a new product in one go.\n\nAn example of this can be found in the music industry. Indie artists may access the same distribution channels as major record labels, with potentially fewer restrictions and manufacturing costs. There is a growing collection of 'Internet labels' that offer distribution to unsigned or independent artists directly to online music stores, and in some cases marketing and promotion services. Further, many bands are able to bypass this completely, and offer their music for sale via their own independently controlled websites.\n\nAn issue is the large number of incompatible formats in which content is delivered, restricting the devices that may be used, or making data conversion necessary.\n\nThe rise of online distribution has provided controversy for the traditional business models and resulted in challenges as well as new opportunities for traditional retailers and publishers. Online distribution affects all of the traditional media markets including music, press, and broadcasting. In Britain, the iPlayer, a software application for streaming television and radio, accounts for 5% of all bandwidth used in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe move towards online distribution led to a dip in sales in the 2000s when CD sales were nearly cut in half. One such example of online distribution taking its toll on a retailer is the Canadian music chain Sam the Record Man who blamed online distribution for having to close a number of its traditional retail venues in 2007–08. One main reason that sales took such a big hit was that unlicensed downloads of music were very accessible. With copyright infringement affecting sales, the music industry realized it needed to change its business model to keep up with the rapidly changing technology. The step that was taken to move the music industry into the online space has been successful for several reasons. The development of lossy audio compression file formats such as MP3, allows users to compress music files into a high quality format, compressed down to usually a 3-megabyte (MB) file. The lossless FLAC format may require only a few megabytes more. In comparison, the same song might require 30–40 megabytes of storage on a CD. The smaller file size yields much greater Internet transfer speeds.\n\nThe transition into the online space has boosted sales, and profit for some artists. It has also allowed for potentially lower expenses such as lower coordination costs, lower distribution costs, as well as the possibility for redistributed total profits. These lower costs have aided new artists in breaking onto the scene and gaining recognition. In the past, some emerging artists have struggled to find a way to market themselves and compete in the various distribution channels. The Internet may give artists more control over their music in terms of ownership, rights, creative process, pricing, and more. In addition to providing global users with easier access to content, online stores allow users to choose the songs they wish instead of having to purchase an entire album from which there may only be one or two titles that the buyer enjoys.\n\nThe number of downloaded single tracks rose from 160 million in 2004 to 795 million in 2006 which accounted for a revenue boost from US$397 million to US$2 billion.\n\nMany traditional network television shows, movies and other video content is now available online, either from the content owner directly or from third party services. YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, Amazon Prime Video, DirecTV, SlingTV and other Internet-based video services allow content owners to let users access their content on computers, smart phones, tablets or by using appliances such as video game consoles, set-top boxes or Smart TVs.\n\nMany film distributors also include a Digital Copy, also called Digital HD, with Blu-ray disc, Ultra HD Blu-ray, 3D Blu-ray or a DVD.\n\nSome companies, such as Bookmasters Distribution, which invested US$4.5 million in upgrading its equipment and operating systems, have had to direct capital toward keeping up with the changes in technology. The phenomenon of books going digital has given users the ability to access their books on handheld digital book readers. One benefit of electronic book readers is that they allow users to access additional content via hypertext links. These electronic book readers also give users portability for their books since a reader can hold multiple books depending on the size of its hard drive. Companies that are able to adapt and make changes to capitalize on the digital media market have seen sales surge. Vice President of Perseus Books Group stated that since shifting to electronic books (e-books), it saw sales rise by 68%. Independent Publishers Group experienced a sales boost of 23% in the first quarter of 2012 alone.\n\nTor Books, a major publisher of science fiction and fantasy books, started to sell e-books DRM-free by July 2012. One year later the publisher stated that they will keep this model as removing DRM was not hurting their digital distribution ebook business. Smaller e-book publishers such as O'Reilly Media, Carina Press and Baen Books had already forgone DRM previously.\n\nOnline distribution is changing the structure of the video game industry. Gabe Newell, creator of the digital distribution service Steam, formulated the advantages over physical retail distribution as such:\n\nSince the 2000s, there has been an increasing number of smaller and niche titles available and commercially successful, e.g. remakes of classic games. The new possibility of the digital distribution stimulated also the creation of game titles of very small video game producers like Independent game developer and Modders (e.g. Garry's Mod), which were before not commercially feasible.\n\nThe years after 2004 saw the rise of many digital distribution services on the PC, such as Amazon Digital Services, Desura, GameStop, Games for Windows – Live, Impulse, Steam, Origin, Battle.net, Direct2Drive, GOG.com, and GamersGate. The offered properties differ significantly: while most of these digital distributors don't allow reselling of bought games, \"Green Man Gaming\" allows this. Another example is \"gog.com\" which has a strict non-DRM policy while most other services allow various (strict or less strict) forms of DRM.\n\nDigital distribution is also more eco-friendly than physical. Optical discs are made of polycarbonate plastic and aluminum. The creation of 30 of them requires the use of 300 cubic feet of natural gas, two cups of oil and 24 gallons of water. The protective cases for an optical disc is made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a known carcinogen.\n\nA general issue is the large number of incompatible data formats in which content is delivered, possibly restricting the devices that may be used, or making data conversion necessary. Streaming services can have several drawbacks: requiring a constant Internet connection to use content; the restriction of some content to never be stored locally; the restriction of content from being transferred to physical media; and the enabling of greater censorship at the discretion of owners of content, infrastructure, and consumer devices.\n\nDecades after the launch of the World Wide Web, in 2019 businesses were still adapting to the evolving world of distributing content digitally—even regarding the definition and understanding of basic terminology.\n"}

It is a part of the association \"Производственное объединение 'Минский тракторный завод'\", or Proizvodotvennoe Obiedinenie Minskiy Traktorniy Zavod (ПО \"МТЗ\", PO MTZ), or Industrial Association \"Minsk Tractor Works\". In addition to the main plant in Minsk, the association includes a number of plants that produce parts and attachable tools for tractors and other vehicles produced by MTZ.\n\nThe plant was established on May 29, 1946. The first tractor, the MTZ-2 model, was manufactured on October 14, 1953.\n\nAs of 2005, it had nearly 20,000 workers. The plant produces over 62 models of vehicles. Its main civil production has been four-wheeled tractors of model \"MTZ\", known as \"Belarus\". By 1995 the plant manufactured 3,000,000 tractors. In 1999, it produced 58% of all tractors manufactured in CIS. In 2017, its share in the production of wheel tractors in CIS countries was 87%. For several years the plant has been holding 8-10% share of the world market of wheeled tractors.\n\nMtz tractors were exported to western Europe.The most popular exported model was Mtz-50(52). There were no major differences between the exported ones and not exported ones, but one major difference was that the exported tractors were painted red.\n\nSince 2000, the tractors of the plant manufactured for export have been certified for the European Union. During their operation in the era of the Soviet Union, they have been awarded the collective titles of the Order of Lenin and the Order of the October Revolution.\n\nIn 2013, the plant tractors were certified in USA by the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) and in Canada by Environment Canada and received full approval for their import and distribution in both countries. Since 2010, distribution of Belarus tractors in USA and Canada is carried on through a local distributor MTZ Equipment Ltd.\n\nOne of the contributing factors to the return of the MTZ tractors to North America was the fact that the factory started making tractors with compression ignition diesel engines matching the current emissions standards, including Tier 3/4i/4 (USA/Canada) and Euro 3a, 3b, 4 (Europe).\n\nIn 2017, 92.1% tractors of 31,011 produced were exported. 8 countries imported more than 500 \"Belarus\" tractors: Russia (11,135), Pakistan (4,845), Ukraine (4,028), Kazakhstan (2,106), Azerbaijan (1,637), Hungary (871), Romania (812), Lithuania (736).\n\nBelarus-80.1; Belarus-82.1; Belarus-90; Belarus-92; Belarus-320; Belarus-310; Belarus-321; Belarus-422; Belarus-510; Belarus, 512; Belarus-520; Belarus-522; Belarus-572; Belarus-622; Belarus-820; Belarus-826; Belarus-892; Belarus-920; Belarus-922.3; Belarus-923.3; Belarus-1021; Belarus-Belarus-1025.2 1220.3; Belarus-1221.2; Belarus-1523; Belarus-2022.3; Belarus-3022DTS.1; Belarus-3522.\n\nBelarus-80X; Belarus-100X; Belarus-920R; Belarus-921.3; BELARUS-921.4-10 / 91.\n\n\nBelarus-2103; Belarus 3023; Belarus-1502; Belarus EP-491; Belarus 1502-01; Belarus MU-466.\n\n\nJoint assembly production of MTZ tractors began in 2013 in Cambodia, at MTZ's first assembly plant in the ASEAN region.

The name means \"birthgiver\" and may also be called the \"Mother of Cradles\". Her full name is given as Ajysyt-ijaksit-khotan, meaning \"Birthgiving nourishing mother\". Aisyt brings the soul from heaven at the birth of a baby and records each one in the Golden Book of Fate and daughter of Yer Tanrı.\n\nAjysyt was responsible for conducting the soul of a newborn child to its birth and attended every birth. Women would channel Ajysyt, believing that doing so would relieve them of pain during childbirth. She kept a golden book in which she recorded each one. She is said to have lived on a mountain top in a house with seven stories, from which she controlled the fate of the world.\n\nThe Yakut revere a variety of ajy ().

It is now run solely by Raymonde.\n\nAfter releasing records with 4AD for a large part of their career, Cocteau Twins decided to start up the Bella Union record label in 1997, through which they could release their own work as well as any collaborative efforts. The band split up not long after, but instead of letting the newly formed label go under, Robin Guthrie, Simon Raymonde and their former manager Fiona Glyn-Jones decided to take charge of it. One of the earliest bands to sign on was the Australian trio Dirty Three, who continue to release under Bella Union. Other early signees include Françoiz Breut and The Czars.\n\nSince 2000, when Guthrie moved to France to concentrate on his own music, Raymonde took the reins at Bella Union.\n\nIn 2007, the 10th anniversary celebrations saw Bella Union host two nights at the Royal Festival Hall, with special guests Paul Weller, Romeo and Tom from Editors.

{"id": "1813625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1813625", "title": "When You Believe", "text": "When You Believe\n\n\"When You Believe\" is a song from the 1998 DreamWorks musical animated feature \"The Prince of Egypt\". It was written and composed by Stephen Schwartz. A pop single version of \"When You Believe\", with additional music and lyrics by writer-producer Babyface, was also recorded for the film by American singers Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston for the film's end credits and its soundtrack album. Additionally, the song was featured on Houston's fourth studio album, \"My Love Is Your Love\" and Carey's first compilation album, \"#1's\". The original version of the song, featured in the narrative portion of the film, is performed by Sally Dworsky, Michelle Pfeiffer, and a children's choir (children’s choir soloist: Andrew Bryan). \"When You Believe\" is described as a big ballad, with meaningful and inspirational lyrics, describing the ability each person has to achieve miracles when they reach out to God and believe.\n\nThe song received generally mixed reviews from music critics and experienced moderate success, peaking at number 15 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, despite heavy media attention and live promotion. It achieved better charting throughout Europe and other nations, reaching number one in Hungary, peaking within the top five in Belgium, France, Iceland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. \"When You Believe\" was awarded the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 71st annual ceremony on March 21, 1999. Prior to their performance of the song that night, Schwartz left Babyface's name off the nomination submission sheet. He felt that because the additions Babyface added to the song were not featured in the actual film version, he did not deserve writing credits. However, while Babyface did not receive the Oscar, Carey and Houston performed his version of the song, because they were more familiar with it than the one in the film. Prior to their performance at the Academy Awards, they sang it on November 26, 1998, on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", promoting the song, as well as both their albums.\n\nThe song featured two music videos. The first and most commonly seen video was filmed at Brooklyn Academy of Music performing arts center. The video features both singers, and begins with Houston and Carey performing in a large auditorium, giving the illusion of a concert. Towards the end of the video, clips of the film are projected onto a large screen at the concert, while they belt out the final verse. The alternate video was only released on NBC's special, \"When You Believe: Music Inspired by the Prince of Egypt\", broadcast on December 13, 1998. It features a similar synopsis, with both singers performing on a large stage of an old Egyptian pyramid.\nWhen Carey compiled her first compilation effort, \"#1's\", \"When You Believe\" was included in the track listing. According to Carey, the song was included because she felt it was \"a miracle\" that she and Houston collaborated on a record. During the development of \"All That Glitters\" (a film Carey was working on at the time, later known as \"Glitter\"), she had been introduced to DreamWorks co-owner Jeffrey Katzenberg, who asked her if she would record the song \"When You Believe\" for the soundtrack of the animated film \"The Prince of Egypt\". Houston, on the other hand, was introduced to the project through Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds, with whom she had been collaborating on her album, \"My Love Is Your Love\". After they were shown the film separately, both became very enthusiastic about participating in the project.\n\nThe song was co-written by Stephen Schwartz and Babyface, who also produced the song. Babyface expressed how he went through more than one version of the song and described its production as a beautiful movie ballad that was something different from anything he, Carey, or Houston had ever previously recorded. In an interview with \"Vibe\", Carey said that she \"liked [the song] the way it was\". She had characterised it as \"a very big ballad but in an inspirational way\" and denied speculation that there had been past rivalry or animosity between her and Houston prior to its recording: \"I never even really talked to her until this. We never had any issues between us. The media and everybody made it an issue.\" In an interview with \"Ebony\", Houston spoke about her relationship with Carey:\n\nI enjoyed working with her very much. Mariah and I got along very great. We had never talked and never sang together before. We just had a chance for camaraderie, singer-to-singer, artist-to-artist, that kind of thing. We just laughed and talked and laughed and talked and sang in between that ... It's good to know that two ladies of soul can still be friends. We talked about doing other things together, enterprise-wise, which is cool, because she's got a good, vivid mind, that girl. She's a smart lady. I really like Mariah.\n\nWhile the pair continued to express their positive feelings for one another, tabloids began writing the opposite. There were claims that the two bore ill will against each other, and that they had to record the song separately due to constant tension. While media speculation grew as the film's release date drew near, both singers maintained that they had become close friends, and had only the most positive things to say about each other.\n\n\"The Prince of Egypt\" is an adaptation of the Biblical story of the Exodus. \"When You Believe\" is sung in the film by characters Tzipporah and Miriam, and a chorus of people departing from the slavery of Egypt to the Red Sea and the Promised Land. The protagonists of this ballad recall tough times that have caused them to question their own faith: they have prayed for many nights to God, but those prayers have seemed to remain unanswered, and now they wonder if their faith has been only a waste of time. Nevertheless, the main characters realize that although the times may be difficult, their faith should remain strong. As a bridge, a chorus of children sings excerpts of the Song of the Sea in Hebrew.\n\nThe original draft of the song used the lyric \"you can do miracles when you believe\", but this seemed to imply that the believer, not God, was responsible for performing miracles; the lyric was later changed to \"there can be miracles when you believe\".\n\nHouston had sung in a church choir while growing up, and Carey had always connected to her faith through music, especially during any difficult times. This song became one of the many reasons that both singers were so interested in the project. They each felt that spreading faith in God was an important and honorable aspect of their career. While describing the song's lyrics and message, Houston said the following in an interview with 'Ebony\":\n\nA powerful ballad; [songwriter] Stephen Schwartz is a genius. You have to be a child of God to understand the depth of this song. Mariah and I did it as we felt it. We both felt very connected to the song because of our background. What can I say? (It is) Just a beautiful song. What a lyric! I can't talk about it—just listen to it.\n\nOriginally, Schwartz composed the film version of \"When You Believe\", which was sung in the film by the characters of Tzipporah (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Miriam (Sally Dworsky). The main melody is based on a traditional Chinese folk composition, \"Dance of the Yao People\". It featured some different instrumentation from the original, and used a children's choir singing lines from the book of Exodus (the Song of the Sea) in Hebrew.\n\nIn order to give the song a wider radio and pop appeal, Edmonds changed some of the song's instrumentals and replaced the children's choir with a gospel one. His version was considered more \"commercial\" and would make the song \"help sell the movie\". Schwartz's original version was titled \"When You Believe\", while Edmonds' enhanced version was titled \"The Prince of Egypt (When You Believe)\". \"When You Believe\" is a slow tempo ballad, which incorporates pop and contemporary R&B genres. A key change separates Houston and Carey's solo parts in the song. During the last bridge and chorus, gospel inspired background singers join the song, giving it a \"layered sound\" while Houston and Carey's voice switch off belting the bridge. After \"When You Believe\" was written, Babyface added additional instrumentation, as well as a final bridge.\n\nThe song is set in common time. Houston's verse is written in the key of B minor and features a basic chord progression of A-G, and the song modulates to D major for her chorus. Her vocals in the song range from the note of F to F. Carey's verse is set in the same key, but the song changes to E major for her chorus. Her vocal range in the song spans from the low note of E to the high note of A, spanning more octaves than Houston's voice in the song. The song's key changes again in the last chorus, to F-sharp major. Steve Jones from \"USA Today\" called the song a \"soaring duet\" and felt that the song would be able to appeal to many types of listeners and \"cross all genres.\"\n\n\"When You Believe\" received a mixed review from David Browne, an editor from \"Entertainment Weekly\". He gave it a C-, and wrote \"[the song has] so much sap, maple trees will be jealous.\" He called the song's religious aspect \"insipid\" and felt its inspirational message felt forced and generic.\n\n\"When You Believe\" won the Academy Award for Best Song at the 1999 Academy Awards, and the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Song at the 4th Critics' Choice Awards. It was also nominated for Best Original Song (in a Motion Picture) at the 1999 Golden Globes, and Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television at the 2000 Grammy Awards.\n\nThe song performed moderately in the United States, despite a performance of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" and the 71st annual Academy Awards. It peaked at number 15 on the Hot 100 and number three on \"Billboard\"'s Adult Contemporary Chart. On March 24, 1999, after fluctuating in the US charts, the song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of over 500,000 units. In Canada, the song debuted on the \"RPM\" Singles Chart at number 66 on the \"RPM\" issue dated December 7, 1998, and peaked at number 20 on the chart issue dated January 25, 1999. It was present on the chart for a total of ten weeks.\n\nThe song performed moderately in Australia, where it entered at number 25 on the ARIA Singles Chart during the week of December 6, 1998. It remained on the chart for 14 weeks, spending its last week on the chart at number 50; it was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), denoting shipments of over 35,000 units. In New Zealand, it peaked at number eight on the singles chart, and spent nine weeks fluctuating in the singles chart. \"When You Believe\" experienced its highest charting in Europe. In Belgium, it reached number five on the Flanders Ultratop 50, and peaked at number four and spent 20 weeks on the Wallonian Ultratop 40. During the week of December 5, 1998, \"When You Believe\" entered the Dutch Top 40 at number fifty-four. The song spent twenty-one weeks on the singles chart and was peaked at number four. Due to strong single sales, the song entered the Finnish Singles Chart at number 10, however, it only spent one week in the chart. In France, the song entered the French Singles Chart at number 14 on December 5, 1998 and eventually peaked at number five. After spending 20 weeks fluctuating in the singles chart, it was certified silver by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP). In Germany, it peaked at number eight on the German Singles Chart and was certified gold by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie, denoting shipments of over 250,000 units. The song peaked at number seven in Ireland, where it spent 11 weeks in the Irish Singles Chart.\n\nIn Norway, \"When You Believe\" entered at number three on the VG-lista chart and peaked at number two, spending three consecutive weeks at the position. It was certified platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) and spent 15 weeks on the chart. The song peaked at number two in Sweden and Switzerland, spending 20 and 24 weeks on the singles charts, respectively. The IFPI certified the song platinum in Sweden and gold in Switzerland. \"When You Believe\" experienced high charting in the United Kingdom. It peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart during the week of December 19, 1998 and spent 14 weeks on the chart. As of 2010, sales of the song in the UK are estimated at 260,000 units.\n\nThe single's music video was filmed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music during the fall of 1998. The video begins with Houston entering a small arena as she begins to sing the song's first verse. As she finishes her part, Carey appears on the stage as well, performing the second verse and chorus. The video is set in a dark studio accented by Egyptian settings, backdrops, and scenes inspired by \"The Prince of Egypt\". An audience is on hand to emulate a concert-like-setting, cheering on both singers. Occasionally, home video clips of Carey and Houston appear throughout the video, as well as clips of the final moments of the film, during the splitting of the Red Sea. The video ends as the room is illuminated, and the two singers are joined by a large choir. As they complete the song, Carey and Houston receive a standing ovation from the crowd, and exit the studio together, walking side by side as they disappear in the distance. For the video, Carey and Houston both donned similar low-cut black gowns, while Carey sported a long straight hairstyle, and Houston a pixie cut.\n\nThe song's alternate video features a similar synopsis, where Houston begins singing the song on a large stone altar in the middle of an auditorium. As she finishes her verse, Carey is seen walking up the ramp in the background, joining Houston for her verse. They continue singing the song together, standing side by side and holding hands. After completing the song, both singers exit the auditorium together as in the first video, simulating two friends enjoying time with each other. Both videos are very similar, only the alternate version does not feature an audience, choir or images, only the duo singing together atop the stone altar. In this version of the video, Houston wears a long brown strapless gown, and features a shoulder length bob haircut. Carey on the otherhand, features long cascading curls and dons an olive green gown.\n\nThe duo performed the song live on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" on November 26, 1998. Aside from the joint performance, Houston and Carey sang their own singles at the time, \"I Learned from the Best\" and \"I Still Believe\", respectively. Additionally, they sang the song live at the 71st Annual Academy Awards on March 21, 1999. Before the performance, they were due to rehearse together a few days before their scheduled appearance. Houston however, called in sick and had to miss the rehearsal. Reportedly, her excuse was not taken well, with academy executives calling it a \"bullshit story.\" Conti, the academy's musical arranger, found a young female singer to take Houston's place, Janis Uhley. Before the performance, Carey walked down the stage in a white top and jeans, while choreographer Debbie Allen led the background singers. As they began the performance, Carey forgot the lyrics and stopped, as Uhley began singing in a \"theatricality and gusto\". Her boastful performance was not taken well by the directors, who called it \"inappropriate and unnerving\". After she was removed from the stage, a new date was chosen for the rehearsal, one that would accommodate both Houston and Carey.\n\nThe next night, after they began the rehearsal, both singers had trouble performing the film version of the song. After hours of practice and confusion, they reached a compromise; they would sing a mash-up of the film and single versions, which featured an additional bridge and instrumentation by Edmonds. For the Oscar ceremony, Houston and Carey wore matching white gowns, symbolizing \"humbleness and simplicity.\" Houston entered the arena, performing her verse, followed by Carey. As the song's finale drew near, a full gospel choir joined the performance from large suspending golden scaffolding, all wearing large white tunics. After the original was nominated for the Academy Award, Schwartz refused to give Edmonds writing credits in nomination forms submitted to the academy.\n\nIn 2016, Carey performed the song on her Sweet Sweet Fantasy Tour with Houston on screen as a tribute to her, since Houston died four years prior to the tour.\n\n\"When You Believe\" was performed by \"American Idol\" contestant and winner Candice Glover on the twelfth season of the show. A studio recording of the song was also released as a single on iTunes.\nGlover performed \"When You Believe\" on \"American Idol\" on the \"Divas\" theme night on April 17, 2013.\nGlover's performance was met with praise from the show's judges and it was generally considered the best performance of the night. \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that Glover \"got judges on their feet\" with her \"impeccable\" performance. Nicki Minaj exlaimed at the end of the performance that \"And that is how you do a Mariah Carey/Whitney Houston song\". Likewise, \"Billboard\" called Glover's performance \"best single showing of the night\" and commented on the vocal delivery that \"she knows precisely when to hit the sweet spot of a song, building up to that point with masterful restraint\". \"MTV News\" commented that Glover \"positively slay[ed]\" the song.\n\nThe song was recorded by Irish musical ensemble Celtic Woman and released as a single from their fifth studio album \"\" (2010). The song also appears on the Japanese release of their seventh studio album \"\" (2011). The song features lead vocals from one of the group's singers Chloë Agnew.\nIn an interview for \"Chicago Music Magazine\", Chloë Agnew described the lyrics of the song as \"really incredible\". She stated that \"It is a songs that I listen to and wish I had written. It’s really so special. I think a lot of people have found strength and hope in the lyrics. It's been really rewarding to meet and talk to people at our meet and greet events come up and tell me how much that song means to them and how it has helped them\". Irish singer Chloë Agnew recorded the track for her debut album \"Chloë\" (2002).\n\nIn 2011, the first season winner of \"The X Factor\", Melanie Amaro covered this song during the live performance.\n\nIn 2014, the song was performed live by Teodora Sava when she was 13 years old, in duet with Nico, as special guests of the Romanian kids talent show Next Star.\n\nAmerican Belz Hasidic singer Shulem Lemmer covered the song, in his album \"The Perfect Dream\", released in 2019.\n\n\"When You Believe\" was recorded by \"The X Factor\" winner Leon Jackson in December 2007, with slightly altered lyrics in the second verse, removing some religious overtones within the song. The single was available to download from midnight after the result of the show on December 15, 2007, and a CD was rush-released mid-week, on December 19, 2007. This was unusual as most new singles were released on a Monday to gain maximum sales for the UK Singles Chart the following Sunday. Exceptions included the previous two \"X Factor\" winners whose were singles released in this fashion, in order for them to compete to be the Christmas number-one single, which they all became. A video for the single was made by each of the final four of the series; Jackson, Rhydian Roberts, Same Difference and Niki Evans. However, only the winner's version of the song and video was released.\n\nThe song ended 2007 as the year's fourth biggest-selling single in the UK and remained number one into 2008. However, it only managed to stay in the top 40 for seven weeks, despite being atop the chart for three weeks. It also soon disappeared from the top 100, and was gone by late February.\n\nThe music video, like previous \"X Factor\" winners singles, is very simple, with Jackson singing the song in front of a large projection, with swooping shots of various landscapes behind him. It also features several clips from his time in \"The X Factor\", from his first audition to the moment he was announced the winner and performed his single to close the series. Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne, Dannii Minogue, Louis Walsh, Dermot O'Leary and runner-up Rhydian Roberts all feature within the clips.\n\nOn December 23, 2007, it debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, making it the coveted Christmas number one with sales of over 275,000 copies. It stayed at number one for three weeks until it fell down to number five on its fourth week and then fell another ten places to number fifteen in its fifth week. According to The Official Charts Company, the song has sold 506,000 copies in the UK as of December 2012. Additionally, It also spent three weeks at the top of the Irish Singles Chart.\n\n\n"}

Wisley is the second most visited paid entry garden in the United Kingdom after the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, with 1,071,088 visitors in 2018.\n\nWisley was founded by Victorian businessman and RHS member George Ferguson Wilson, who purchased a 60-acre (243,000 m²) site in 1878. He established the \"Oakwood Experimental Garden\" on part of the site, where he attempted to \"make difficult plants grow successfully\". Wilson died in 1902 and Oakwood (which was also known as Glebe Farm) was purchased by Sir Thomas Hanbury, the creator of the celebrated garden La Mortola on the Italian Riviera. He gave the Wisley site to the RHS in 1903.\n\nDirectors have included;\n\nWisley is now a large and diverse garden covering 240 acres (971,000 m²). In addition to numerous formal and informal decorative gardens, several glasshouses and an extensive arboretum, it includes small scale \"model gardens\" which are intended to show visitors what they can achieve in their own gardens, and a trials field where new cultivars are assessed. The laboratory, for both scientific research and training, was originally opened in 1907, but proved inadequate. It was expanded and its exterior was rebuilt during World War I. It was designated a Grade II Listed building in 1985. Visitor numbers increased significantly from 5,250 in 1905, to 11,000 in 1908, 48,000 in the late 1920s, and 170,000 in 1957, and passed 400,000 in 1978, 500,000 in 1985, and 600,000 in 1987.

{"id": "1813642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1813642", "title": "Belt (firearms)", "text": "Belt (firearms)\n\nA belt or ammunition belt is a device used to retain and feed cartridges into a firearm. Belts and the associated feed systems are typically employed to feed machine guns or other automatic weapons. Belt-fed systems minimize the proportional weight of the ammunition to the feeding device along with allowing high rates of continuous fire. The capacity of belts and carriers is typically a function of weight and bulk. Their size is limited by caliber and the portability of the combined weapon and ammunition. The most common sizes typically carried on a man-portable weapon run from 50 to 300 rounds.\n\nThe \"feed strip\" (also referred to as an \"ammo strip\" or \"feed tray\") was initially designed in 1895, based on initial designs by Captain Baron Adolf Odkolek von Ujezda of Vienna, Austria. A feed strip is a simple rigid metal (usually steel or brass) tray with typically 24 to 30 cartridges crimped together into a row. The feed strip is loaded into the side of the gun and as the cartridges are stripped off and fired from the weapon, the tray gradually moves to the other side until it falls out when it is empty, whereupon a new one is inserted. In this regard, it is similar to an En-bloc clip. The \"feed strip\" loading system was pioneered by the Hotchkiss machine gun designs, most notably the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun. The Hotchkiss guns were used by major militaries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and the French throughout the duration of the first World War and slightly afterwards. However, the feed strip mechanisms lived on through other militaries, most notably the Japanese-designed Type 3 and Type 92 machine guns, which were used up until the end of the Second World War.\n\nThough the feed strips were replaced by most militaries by machine guns using either belts or magazines, the Hotchkiss feed strip design actually pioneered an early 50-round belt mechanism, made up of articulated pieces of metal folded together, resembling feed strips. The articulated Hotchkiss belt design also dates back to 1896.\n\nMany modern ammunition belts use disintegrating links. Disintegrating links retain a single round and are articulated with the round ahead of it in the belt. When the round ahead is stripped from the belt and fed into the feed system or chamber, the link holding it is ejected and the link holding the following round is disarticulated. Many disintegrating belt designs allow two pieces of belt to be connected by a cartridge, it applies even to non-disintegrating belts. When done by assistant gunner in combat, linking a new belt to the end of the belt already being fed in the weapon allows for continuous fire without the need to open the feed tray and reload.\n\nThis type of belt consists of a design that can be reused, as it does not fall apart during function, similar to a feed strip. This is found on only a few types of machine guns, such as the Soviet DShK, RPD, PK, the German MG 34, MG 42, MG 3 and the British Vickers, which used a non-disintegrating canvas and brass belt. Arguably, precursors to the belt-fed machine gun were the Cass rifle, patented in 1848, and the Treeby chain gun, patented in the 1850s. Belts were originally composed of canvas or cloth with pockets spaced evenly to allow the belt to be mechanically fed into the gun. These designs were prone to malfunctions due to the effects of oil and other contaminants altering the belt. If they became saturated with water, canvas belts including the loops holding the cartridges would contract, and the gun mechanism would be unable to extract the rounds. Later belt designs used permanently connected metal links to hold the cartridges, and weapons which originally used textile belts such as the Vickers Gun were then deployed with these more dependable formats. These belts were more tolerant to exposure to solvents and oil. Despite it being a more efficient system, few are still used, possibly due to the added cost and effort. Non-disintegrating belts often come in pieces of limited length connected by disintegrating link, and after being fed through the weapon the piece falls off, limiting the length of the used belt hanging from the weapon to no more than one such piece. Many weapons designed to use non-disintegrating or canvas belts are provided with machines to automatically reload these belts with loose rounds or rounds held in stripper clips. In use during World War I, reloaders allowed ammunition belts to be recycled quickly to allow practically continuous fire.\n\nFound on mostly early machine guns. The pull out - push through cartridge feed system has the cartridge withdrawn from the belt to the rear, then pushed directly forward into the barrel. Examples are the Darne mle 1922, Browning 1919, Browning M2HB, Maxim and Vickers. Among the modern machine guns using this system are the PK family, where its use is mandated by the rim of the 7.62×54mmR cartridge, which makes it all but impossible to eject the round forward from the belt.\n\nFound on mostly modern machine guns. The push through cartridge feed system has the cartridge pushed directly forward into the barrel. Examples are the non-disintegrating \"Patronengurt 33, 34, or 34/41\" used by the MG 34 and MG 42 and the derived \"Patronengurt DM1\" used by the MG 3 whose feeding systems were based on the direct push-through of the cartridge out of the link into the gun’s chamber. Accordingly, the link had to be of the half-open type to enable the motion of the bolt through the link. Many modern machine guns use or can use the disintegrating half-open type 7.62×51mm NATO M13 link or 5.56×45mm NATO M27 link.\n\nSome weapons such as the M134 Minigun and related designs use a hybrid mechanism to strip rounds from disintegrating belts into a linkless feed system or a specialized delinker to allow for more reliable feeding at extreme rates of fire. Modern infantry machine guns often have feed systems allowing the use of linked ammunition as well as other forms of feed like from magazines or drums. In some instances—like the FN MINIMI/M249 SAW and the IMI Negev—the feed system requires no modification to fire with either mechanism. Other designs—like the Heckler and Koch HK21-based designs or MG34—require the exchange of modular parts to allow belt or alternate feeding. Due to the lack of protection provided by the belt, belt-fed infantry weapons typically use a flexible or rigid container to retain the belt on the weapon. In some designs—like the MG3—the belt container appears to be a magazine causing some confusion to people unfamiliar with the design.\n\n"}

He was surnamed \"The Fair\", because he was an attractive man. He was born and raised in Macedonia. Demetrius was named after his father and was the youngest of the children of King Demetrius I of Macedon and his wife, Ptolemais. Demetrius I married Ptolemais as his fifth wife around 287 BC/286 BC in Miletus, while this was Ptolemais’ first marriage. Demetrius was the only child born into the marriage, as his father died shortly thereafter, in 283 BC. From his father’s previous marriages, Demetrius had various paternal half siblings, who included king Antigonus II Gonatas, as well as Stratonice of Syria, princess and later Queen of the Seleucid Empire.\n\nDemetrius’ maternal grandparents were the first Greek-Egyptian pharaoh Ptolemy I Soter and Eurydice. Among his maternal aunts were Queen Arsinoe II of Egypt and among his maternal uncles were Pharaoh Ptolemy II Philadelphus and Macedonian King Ptolemy Keraunos (Keraunos was Ptolemais’ full blooded brother). Pharaoh Ptolemy III Euergetes was a maternal cousin. His paternal grandparents were Macedonian king Antigonus I Monophthalmus and Stratonice, while his paternal uncle was the general Philip.\n\nNot much is known about him until 249 BC. Greek Cyrenaean king Magas of Cyrene died in 249 BC or 250 BC. His widow was the powerful Greek monarch Apama II. She was Demetrius' niece through his paternal half sister Stratonice of Syria and her husband Antiochus I Soter of the Seleucid Empire.\n\nApama summoned Demetrius from Macedonia. She offered her daughter with Magas (her only child) Berenice II in marriage to Demetrius. Demetrius in return would become King of Cyrenaica and protect Cyrenaica from the Ptolemaic dynasty. Demetrius agreed to Apama's request and married Berenice. When he married Berenice and became king, there was no opposition in his rise to the throne, but he became ambitious to the point of recklessness.\n\nSometime after his marriage to Berenice, Demetrius and Apama became lovers. Jealous of her husband's affair with her mother, Berenice argued with both of them and consented to the assassination of Demetrius, who died in Apama’s arms. The poem \"Coma Berenices\" by Greek poet Callimachus (lost, but known in a Latin translation or paraphrase by Catullus), apparently refers to her coup against Demetrius: \"Let me remind you how stout-hearted you were even as a young girl: have you forgotten the brave deed by which you gained a royal marriage?\"\n\nDemetrius's first marriage was to an Olympias, a Greek noblewoman from Larissa, the daughter of a nobleman, Polycletus or Polyclitus of Larissa. She probably died before 249 BC. Their children were Antigonus III Doson, the later Macedonian King, and Echecrates, a nobleman about whom not much is known apart from the fact that he had a son whom he named after his brother Antigonus. A few months before his paternal second cousin King Philip V of Macedon’s death, Echecrates' son Antigonus revealed to Philip that Philip's son, the prince Perseus of Macedon, had made false accusations against his brother, Philip's other son, Demetrius, whom Philip had then had put to death. Philip, indignant at Perseus’ conduct appointed Antigonus as his successor. When Philip died in 179 BC and Antigonus became king, Perseus ousted Antigonus and had him executed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1813654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1813654", "title": "Yekuno Amlak", "text": "Yekuno Amlak\n\nEmperor Yekuno Amlak (; throne name Tasfa Iyasus) was an Amhara prince from Bet Amhara province (in today's Wollo region) who became king of kings of Ethiopia following the defeat of the last Zagwe king. He was \"nəgusä nägäst\" (r. 10 August 1270 – 19 June 1285) of Ethiopia and founder of the Solomonic dynasty. He traced his ancestry through his father, Tasfa Iyasus, to Dil Na'od, the last King of Axum.\n\nMuch of what is known about Yekuno Amlak is based on oral traditions and medieval hagiographies. Yekuno Amlak was educated at Lake Hayq's Istifanos Monastery near Amba Sel, where later medieval hagiographies state Saint Tekle Haymanot raised and educated him, and helped him to depose the last King of the Zagwe Dynasty. Earlier hagiographies, however, state that it was Iyasus Mo'a, the abbot of Istifanos Monastery in Lake Hayq, who helped him achieve power. G.W.B. Huntingford explains this discrepancy by pointing out Istifanos had once been the premier monastery of Ethiopia, but Tekle Haymanot's Debre Libanos eventually eclipsed Istifanos, and from the reign of Amda Seyon it became the custom to appoint the abbot of Debre Libanos \"Ichege\", or secular head of the Ethiopian Church. However, neither of these traditions is contemporary with any of the individuals involved.\n\nThere was also the story, related in both the \"Life of Iyasus Mo'a\" and the \"Be'ela nagastat\", that a rooster was heard to prophesize outside of the house of the Yakuno Amlak for three months that whoever ate his head would be king. The king then had the bird killed and cooked, but the cook discarded the rooster's head—which Yekuno Amlak ate, and thus became ruler of Ethiopia. Scholars have pointed out the similarity between this legend and one about the first king of Kaffa, who likewise learned from mysterious voice that eating the head of a certain rooster would make him king, as well as the Ethiopian \"Mashafa dorho\" or \"Book of the Cock\", which relates a story about a cooked rooster presented to Christ at the Last Supper which is brought back to life.\n\nTraditional history further reports that Yekuno Amlak was imprisoned by the Zagwe King Za-Ilmaknun (\"the unknown, the hidden one\") on Mount Malot, but managed to escape. He gathered support in the Amhara provinces and in Shewa, after receiving considerable aid from the Muslim Sultanate of Shewa with an army of followers, defeated the Zagwe king. Taddese Tamrat argued that this king was Yetbarak, but due to a local form of \"damnatio memoriae\", his name was removed from the official records. A more recent chronicler of Wollo history, Getatchew Mekonnen Hasen, flatly states that the last Zagwe king deposed by Yekuno Amlak was none other than Na'akueto La'ab himself.\n\nYekuno Amlak is said to have campaigned against the Kingdom of Damot, which lay south of the Abbay River. According to Arabic texts found in Harar, deposed Sultan Dil Marrah of Sultanate of Shewa successfully appealed to Yekuno Amlak in 1279 to restore his rule. \n\nRecorded history affords more certainty as to his relations with other countries. For example, E.A. Wallis Budge states that Yekuno Amlak not only exchanged letters with the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII, but sent to him several giraffes as a gift. At first, his interactions with his Muslim neighbors were friendly; however his attempts to be granted an Abuna for the Ethiopian Orthodox Church strained these relations. A letter survives that he wrote to the Mamluk Sultan Baibars, who was suzerain over the Patriarch of Alexandria (the ultimate head of the Ethiopian church), for his help for a new Abuna in 1273; the letter suggests this was not his first request. When one did not arrive, he blamed the intervention of the Sultan of Yemen, who had hindered the progress of his messenger to Cairo.\n\nTaddesse Tamrat interprets Yekuno Amlak's son's allusion to Syrian priests at the royal court as a result of this lack of attention from the Patriarch. Taddesse also notes that around this time, the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch were struggling for control of the appointment of the bishop of Jerusalem, until then the prerogative of the Patriarch of Antioch. One of the moves in this dispute was Patriarch Ignatius IV Yeshu's appointment of an Ethiopian pilgrim as Abuna. This pilgrim never attempted to assume this post in Ethiopia, but—Taddesse Tamrat argues—the lack of Coptic bishops forced Yekuno Amlak to rely on the Syrian partisans who arrived in his kingdom.\n\nYekuno Amlak is credited with the construction of the Church of Gennete Maryam near Lalibela, which contains the earliest surviving dateable wall paintings in Ethiopia.\n\nHis descendant Emperor Baeda Maryam I had Yekuno Amlak's body re-interred in the church of Atronsa Maryam.\n"}

The later Revised game included material from \"\" and changed various feats and classes.\n\nThe \"Star Wars Roleplaying Game\" uses a Vitality/Wound point system instead of standard hit points, dividing damage into superficial harm (Vitality) and serious injury (Wounds). A character gains Vitality points just like hit points in other d20 games, and rolls for them each level and adds their Constitution bonus. A character's Wound points are equal to their Constitution score.\n\nMost game mechanics are familiar to players of \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and other d20-based games. Characters have six Ability Scores (i.e., the standard Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma), a class and level, feats, and skills. Most actions are resolved by rolling a twenty-sided die and adding a modifier; if the result equals or exceeds the difficulty, the check succeeds.\n\nAs with most d20 System games, \"Star Wars\" offers playable races (called species) and classes to the Player Characters (PCs).\n\nThe species of \"Star Wars d20\" that are included with the Revised Core Rulebook are: Humans, Bothans, Cereans, Duros, Ewoks, Gungans, Ithorians, Kel Dor, Mon Calamari, Quarren, Rodians, Sullustans, Trandoshans, Twi'leks, Wookiees, and Zabrak and the unusual option for d20 games, Droid (this is unusual because it allows you to create your own race to an extent, and also you are ruled - technically mastered - by another player).\n\nThe character classes are Fringer, Noble, Scoundrel, Soldier, Force Adept, Jedi Guardian, Jedi Consular, Scout, and Tech Specialist (added with the Revised Edition). Prestige classes allow advanced characters who wish to specialize in certain suites of abilities to join a class devoted to them. For example, Jedi with special talents at helping others can choose to specialize as a Jedi Healer, while a blaster-wielding mercenary might earn a reputation as a Bounty Hunter. The core rulebook includes the Jedi Master, Jedi Ace, Crime lord, Elite Trooper, Starship Ace, Officer, Darkside Marauder, and Darkside Devotee.

{"id": "1813664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1813664", "title": "Baltimore Terrapins", "text": "Baltimore Terrapins\n\nThe Baltimore Terrapins were one of the most successful teams in the short-lived Federal League of professional baseball from to , but their brief existence led to litigation that led to an important legal precedent in baseball. The team played its home games at Terrapin Park.\n\nMost of the professional baseball teams in Baltimore have been called the Orioles, in reference to the Baltimore oriole bird. There was already a minor league Baltimore Orioles, and the new Federal League club built their ballpark directly across the street from the Orioles park. The new club chose to call itself the Baltimore Terrapins, after the diamondback terrapin, the state reptile of Maryland. That nickname would later become primarily associated with the University of Maryland, College Park sports teams called the Maryland Terrapins.\n\nWhile the team posted a respectable 84–70 record and finished only 4½ games out of first place under player-manager Otto Knabe, the team was less than successful at the box office, even though four of the eight teams in the league (Chicago, Brooklyn, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis) were competing with one and even two (Chicago and St. Louis) other major league teams in the same cities.\n\nIn an attempt to turn this situation around and attract a marquee player to help them at the box office, the team recruited Chief Bender of the American League champion Philadelphia Athletics. The Athletics had sold off several future Hall-of-Famers like Eddie Plank, Eddie Collins and Frank \"Home Run\" Baker after being swept by the surprising Boston Braves in the 1914 World Series.\n\nBender had come off an impressive 17–3 season where he compiled seven shutouts and a 2.26 ERA in 1914. However, his 1915 season at Baltimore was a low point of his Hall of Fame career when he slumped to a 4–16 record, no shutouts, and a 3.99 ERA. Baltimore's collapse to a 47–107 record, 40 games out of first, was overshadowed only by the collapse of Bender's former team who went from a 99–53 league championship season to a dismal 43–109 record, 58½ games out of first in 1915. Bender and the Baltimore Terrapins never made a full recovery from 1915.\n\nThe incident did show the Federal League could compete seriously with the National League and American League on a professional baseball level and led to the buy-out truce which ended the Federal League for good. However, the Baltimore team's owners were not offered a part in this buyout.\n\nWhen the Federal League started, the Terrapins severely cut into the minor league Baltimore Orioles' attendance, causing financial problems for the owner. As a result, several players, including the young left-handed pitcher Babe Ruth, were offered for sale to major league teams. Ruth's contract was purchased by the Boston Red Sox, after being turned down by Connie Mack and the Philadelphia Athletics. In 1914, the Babe begin his career with the Red Sox of the rival American League. After the demise of the Federal League and the Terrapins, Baltimore would not see major league baseball again until , when the former St. Louis Browns moved into town and became the current-day Baltimore Orioles.\n\nAs the Terrapins' owners were not offered any part of the buyout offer made to most Federal League teams by the American and National Leagues, they decided to sue alleging that the buyout was in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The resulting case led to the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that the scheduling and playing of \"base ball games\" did not constitute \"interstate commerce\" in any sense envisioned by the Framers of the United States Constitution and therefore the Sherman Act and other federal laws and regulations did not apply to baseball. The case, \"Federal Baseball Club v. National League\", was not ultimately decided until 1922.\n\nThe minor league Orioles moved into Terrapin Park, a wooden ballpark. This move began a chain of events which would eventually lead to the return of major league baseball to Baltimore.\n\n"}

The Cedar Point community included several churches, a post office, and a gas station. Some of the old homes now serve as quarters for Navy personnel stationed there.\n\nIn 1937, the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics sought to consolidate aviation test programs, previously being conducted at several stations, including Dahlgren and Norfolk, the Washington Navy Yard, Naval Air Station Anacostia in Washington, D.C., and the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Cedar Point was selected due to its remote location on the coastline, well removed from air traffic congestion, with ample space for weapons testing.\n\nThe onset of American involvement in World War II spurred establishment of the new air station. Rear Admiral John Henry Towers, Chief of Bureau of Aeronautics, requested approval and authorization to begin construction on December 22, 1941. Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, gave approval on 7 January 1942 and construction began on 4 April 1942.\n\nThe original civilian residents had about a month, until 1 March 1942, to relocate as the federal government purchased all the land at a cost of $712,287 for , which in 2013 dollars would be the equivalent of being paid $1,261 per acre. Many residents were forced to sell land that had been in their families for generations. Some families had roots in the area going back 300 years. These included traditional farming, crabbing and fishing families and there were protests. National wartime urgency was however felt in Washington at the time to take precedence, and the process of eminent domain went through.\n\nA lack of transportation in Saint Mary's County led the Navy to acquire and revitalize a branchline called the Washington, Brandywine and Point Lookout Railroad (aka \"The Farmers' Railroad\") from Brandywine to Mechanicsville, Maryland, in June 1942 and build an extension south from Mechanicsville to the air station. Known as the U.S. Government Railroad, the rail line was steam-powered and operated south of Brandywine for exclusive official use until 1954, when the Pennsylvania Railroad assumed operation of the line. Rail service ended in 1965, and the line was subsequently scrapped, although the right-of-way is still very visible.\n\nA highway extension to the new air station was required by the project—250,000 tons of material were transported by either truck or water routes during a year of construction.\n\nEmploying some 7,000 at its peak of construction, the area had a Gold Rush \"boom town\" feel as local residents were joined by workers from all over the country, eager to get on the high-paying jobs on station.\n\nOn 20 October 1942, U.S. Marines first arrived and took over security. Today, the station utilizes Navy Masters-At-Arms (MA) and Navy Civilian Police Department of Defense Police for standard local law enforcement and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) for high-profile criminal investigations.\n\nDuring construction, housing needs far outstripped supply, and barracks were built for workers on the station. Later, several housing areas were erected off station for workers and their families in Lexington Park, formerly Jarboesville, named in honor of the USS \"Lexington\", the Navy's second aircraft carrier, lost during the Battle of the Coral Sea on 8 May 1942. The town's expansion had begun.\n\nThe station was formally commissioned \"U.S. Naval Air Station, Patuxent River, Maryland\" on 1 April 1943. In a ceremony presided over by RADM John S. McCain, Sr., then chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Patuxent River was referred to as \"the most needed station in the Navy.\" The unofficial name had been \"Cedar Point\" or the \"Naval Air Station at Cedar Point\", but officials were concerned about possible confusion with the Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, so the new facility was named for the adjacent river.\n\nIn 1945 the Test Pilot School was established with the Navy's Flight Test Group transferred from Naval Air Station Anacostia, Washington, DC to NAS Patuxent River.\n\nOn June 16, 1945, the Naval Air Test Center was established as a separate entity, incorporating flight test and other test groups, at the Naval Air Station.\n\nThe base became a center for testing as several facilities were constructed throughout the 1950s and 1960s; including the facilities for United States Naval Test Pilot School (1958), the Weapons Systems Test Division (1960), and the Propulsion System Evaluation Facility. The base also served as the testing facility for the V-22 Osprey.\n\nIn addition to its role in testing naval aircraft, during the 1950s to 1970s Patuxent River served as an operational base for a Transport Squadron - VR-1, a TACAMO squadron - VQ-4, Airborne Training Unit Atlantic - AEWTULANT, and VW-11, VW-13 AN VW-15 and a number of Patrol Squadrons including VP-8, VP-44, VP-49, VP-24, VP-30 and VP-68.\n\nBy 1965, reconnaissance Squadron VQ-4, based at NAS Patuxent River, began using Lockheed C-130s equipped with special communications equipment to perform their around-the-clock Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO) mission. VQ-4 provided long-range, very-low-frequency communications relay between the National Command Center and the ballistic missile submarine fleet. Two A-7A Corsair II aircraft made the transatlantic crossing from NAS Patuxent River to Évreux, France, in 1967, racking up 3,327 nautical miles in just over seven hours, an unofficial long distance, non-refueled flight by light attack jet aircraft.\n\nCooperation with the British also led to transatlantic visits to PAX River by RAF squadrons.\n\nResearch and development at NAS Patuxent River forged ahead in the 1970s. The Grumman F-14 Tomcat, the McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II jump jet, and the Lockheed P-3 Orion were just a few of the major aircraft programs undergoing the rigorous test and evaluation process at NAS Patuxent River. Helicopter programs also achieved major milestones during the 1970s. The Naval Air Test Center (NATC) at NAS Patuxent River took part in helicopter development and testing for new roles, such as minesweeping. The final flight of the service acceptance trials for the Bell AH-1 SuperCobra gunship were made at NATC Patuxent River.\n\nOn 1 April 1976, Patuxent River's airfield was named after pioneering aviator VADM Frederick M. Trapnell, a former commander of the Naval Air Test Center at the station. Keynote address speaker, ADM Frederick H. Michaelis, Chief of Naval Material, noted: \"All who fly in Navy blue remain indebted to Vice Admiral Trapnell. This field will serve as a living reminder of that debt.\"\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, the Pentagon's Base Realignment and Closure measures have migrated research and testing facilities for both rotary and fixed-wing aircraft to NAS Patuxent River from decommissioned bases. The complex now hosts over 17,000 people, including active-duty service members, civil-service employees, defense contractor employees, and military dependents.\n\nThe base was also used as a filming location for the Harrison Ford film \"Random Hearts\" (1999). Ford and director Sydney Pollack both visited Naval Air Station Patuxent River. Ford, a certified pilot, flew the aircraft himself.\n\nIn January, 1992, the PAX River Station acquired the Aircraft Division of the Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWCAD). Naval Test Wing Atlantic (NTWL) was already located there. NAWCAD was a branch of the Naval Air Warfare Center, created in 1991, and located in Washington, DC. Its mission was the development and improvement of weapons. The partnership of these two units led to a flourishing of aircraft research and development at Patuxent.\n\nA number of new laboratory facilities on the forefront of research were created: a Manned Flight Simulator, the Aircraft Anechoic Test Facility, the Air Combat Environment Test and Evaluation Facility, the Aircraft Test and Evaluation Facility, the Captain Steven A. Hazelrigg Flight Test Facility. The physical plant was expanded by new construction: the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School academic building, an Aviation Survival Training Center pool facility and a new Air Traffic Control Tower. The base has not been slow in social advancement, either. In 2013, a new, large-size Child Development Center (CDC) was completed. On 18 September 2014, Captain Heidi Fleming became the first female commanding officer of NAS Patuxent River, where she served until 2016.\n\nFor the future, the researchers are looking in the direction of unmanned flight.\n\n\nThe base is located adjacent to Lexington Park, Maryland\n\nThe town is unincorporated and is under the Saint Mary's County government which also provides all municipal services.\n\nLimited local buses are provided through St. Mary's Transit , and commuter bus service to Washington, D.C. is provided by MTA .\n\nThe nearest commercial airports are Reagan National Airport in Washington D.C. and Baltimore Washington International Airport (BWI) in suburban Baltimore.\n\nSt. Mary's County is also served by a civilian general aviation airport called Captain Walter Duke Regional Airport near Leonardtown, Maryland\n\n\n\n\nMilitary\n\nArea Recreation and attractions\n"}

In the first year of his reign, one Sheikh Abu-Abdallah had gathered a large following and proclaimed a jihad against Wedem Arad's realm. Wedem Arad sent a number of agents into Abu-Abdallah's camp, who were able to persuade most of his followers to defect. Without sufficient manpower, Abu-Abdallah was forced to agree to a treaty with Wedem Arad, in return for providing \"them with all their needs until they are completely satisfied\". Taddesse Tamrat suggests this involved giving them land to settle on, and notes that on the edge of the territory of Shewa there is a locality known as \"Abdalla\", which might be that settlement.\n\nIn 1306, Wedem Arad sent an embassy of 30 envoys to Europe seeking the \"king of the Spains\" (probably Castile and Aragon). Perhaps hearing of the Christians' successes against Al-Andalus in Iberia, Wedem Arad sought to negotiate a mutual defense pact with them against their common Muslim enemies. Whether or not the envoys reached their destination is unknown, but they did visit Rome and got as far as Avignon. Delayed on their way home, they spent some time in Genoa, where they were interviewed by the geographer Giovanni da Carignano. Giovanni's account of their country based on the interviews is lost, but was summarized by Jacobus Philippus Foresti da Bergamo in his \"Supplementum Chronicarum\"; this is the first text that associates the legendary figure of Prester John with Ethiopia.\n\nG.W.B.

It is the second most used system in Canada (after the Toronto Public Library) and the sixth most used library system in North America. This is despite the fact that the Calgary Public Library has one of the lowest per capita funding in the country, receiving as little as half the money of other Canadian public libraries.\n\nThe Calgary Public Library Board of Trustees was established on May 18, 1908. R. B. Bennett, who would later serve as Prime Minister of Canada, was among the five people appointed to the board. The first public library opened on January 2, 1912, thanks in part to the generosity of Scottish / American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie.\n\nCarnegie funded $80,000 of the $100,000 cost of Calgary's Central Library, (now renamed the Memorial Park Branch), pressuring City Hall to fund the rest.\n\nThe building was the first purpose-built public library in Alberta. It was designed by Boston architects McLean & Wright, and built out of local Paskapoo Sandstone (a soft stone that today presents a substantial preservation challenge). This library branch is a copy of a library in Attleboro, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1929 the formal Victorian-style park surrounding the Central Library was dedicated to the honour of those who had died in the Great War. During construction of the original building, the Calgary Library Board sought out a librarian to oversee the opening of its new library. In January 1911, Alexander Calhoun, a thirty-one-year-old graduate of Queen's University, was appointed Calgary's Librarian. Calhoun served as the head of the Calgary Public Library until his retirement in 1945.\n\nWhen a new downtown central library was constructed in the early 1960s, the original branch was renamed the Memorial Park branch, and still operates today. An addition to the 1960s Central Library was built in 1974, doubling the size of the building.\n\nIn 2013, CNOOC subsidiary Nexen donated 1.5M dollars to the Calgary Public Library. The company has secured the naming rights for high tech learning commons in the new Calgary Central Library. CNOOC CEO Li Fanrong reiterated the gesture was motivated by the company's corporate responsibilities to Calgary. There have been concerns of censorship as CNOOC is a Chinese state run company, however McIntyre Royston library foundation head assures that the library's collection won't be censored.\n\nThe location of the new library is in the Downtown East Village (just across 3rd St. S.E. from the new City Hall). On February 25, 2013, City Hall was approved the master plan to have the new library be built at the fore-mentioned location at Downtown East Village with the overall cost of C$245 million.

{"id": "1813703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1813703", "title": "Amda Seyon I", "text": "Amda Seyon I\n\nAmda Seyon I (also Amde Tsiyon and other variants, , , \"Pillar of Zion\") was Emperor of Ethiopia (nəgusä nägäst) (1314–1344; throne name Gebre Mesqel , , \"slave of the cross\"), and a member of the Solomonic dynasty. According to the British expert on Ethiopia, Edward Ullendorff, \"Amde Tseyon was one of the most outstanding Ethiopian kings of any age and a singular figure dominating the Horn of Africa in the fourteenth century.\" His conquests of Muslim borderlands greatly expanded Ethiopian territory and power in the region, maintained for centuries after his death. Amda Seyon asserted the strength of the newly (1270) installed Solomonic dynasty and therefore legitimized it. These expansions further provided for the spread of Christianity to frontier areas, sparking a long era of proselytization, Christianization, and integration of previously peripheral areas.\n\nIt is argued that there is sufficient evidence to show that Amda Seyon was the son of Wedem Arad. However, when a deputation of monks led by Basalota Mikael accused him of incest for marrying Emperor Wedem Arad's concubine Jan Mogassa and threatened to excommunicate him, he claimed to be the biological son of the Emperor's brother Qidm Asagid; this explanation may have had its origins in court gossip. Whatever the truth of Amda Seyon's parentage, the imperial history known as the Paris Chronicle records that he expressed his rage at his accusers by beating one of them, Abbot Anorewos of Segaja, and exiling the other ecclesiastics to Dembiya and Begemder.\n\nIt is not known how Amda Seyon became Emperor. However, there are a few pieces of information that indicate that he may have been involved in the succession struggle against Wedem Arad.\n\nEmperor Amda Seyon's army was remarkably similar to the organization of the army during ancient Aksumite times. It consisted of two parts: the first, his central army, was very effective and closely attached to the Royal Court; the second was a much larger local militia raised in times of local crises. These local units would, as in Aksumite times, form a distinctive unit and fight together, maintaining their local character and were divided into smaller units each headed by a local ruler. Though these local units were largely out of the direct control of Amda Seyon, during his reign, the control of vassal contingents enjoyed by the Emperor increased greatly and would continue until Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi's conquest of Abyssinia (\"Futuh al-Habash\") in the 16th century.\n\nThe central army was divided into independent regiments, each with its own specialized name, such as \"Qeste-Nihb\", \"Hareb Gonda\", and \"Tekula\". The independent regiments competed for the king's favor, who \"raised\" and \"nourished\" them from childhood. The regiments were led by an intimately loyal commander directly responsible to Amda Seyon. His own son, Saf-Asegid, commanded one of these divisions, as did Amda Seyon's brother-in-law. Moreover, the commander of \"Qeste-Nihb\", Simishehal, along with his colleague Inze-Aygeb, were described as the \"most beloved\" officers of the Emperor, who was distressed when he learned of their injury at the Battle of Hagera. The specialized regiments tied their fortune to that of the Emperor and were most likely taken from the best soldiers from around the country. Amda Seyon used them whenever quick action had to be taken, and their regiment commanders would often serve the role of governor in times of crises in certain provinces, as did Digna, the right-wing commander of the cavalry regiment \"Korem\" (named after the region/town of the same name) in 1332 in Tigray. His central army further consisted of regional regiments similar to those of his local militias. They were drawn mainly from newly conquered provinces and shared a cultural and linguistic heritage. Most soldiers were probably prisoners taken in the conquests, though some were undoubtedly kept as servants to the royal court, while others were exported to slave markets or given to private citizens. Those who were to serve the Emperor were given military training, probably under a commander from the same region and loyal to the Emperor. Most of these groups were broken down into smaller sections due to their size; for instance, in Amda Seyon's 1332 (or 1329) campaigns, a division of Damot fought the Beta Israel in the north, while another went to fight in the campaigns in the south against the Sultanate of Ifat.\n\nThe Emperor improved the imperial army, which until his reign was not as heavily armed as his Muslim adversaries. The 14th century Arab historian al-Umari noted regarding Ethiopian troops that\nDespite the wide variety of weapons ascribed to the Ethiopian troops by al-Umari, swords and daggers were not often used by the Ethiopian army, which was mainly armed with bows, spears, and shields for defense, along with mounted soldiers. The Muslims, however, are described as having \"swords, daggers, iron sticks [\"dimbus\"]\" and other weapons useful in close quarters, and al-Umari notes that \"the arrows of the warriors of the Muslim borderlands are bigger\" than those of the Solomonic army. The Ethiopian army's strength was mainly numerical, but Amda Seyon did much to improve his army's equipment, increasing the use of swords and daggers (probably obtained through Muslim traders), and creating a special regiment armed with swords. The Emperor also formed a special regiment of shield-bearers that was probably used to guard his archers.\n\nTaddesse Tamrat reports that he found a contemporary note written in a manuscript now kept in the island monastery of Lake Hayq, which mentions that in 1309 AM (1316/7 AD), Emperor Amda Seyon successfully campaigned against the Muslim Damot and Hadiya Kingdoms. The note describes his conquest first of Damot, many of whose people he exiled to another area, and then of Hadiya, to whose people he did likewise. Though his early control of these regions was minimal, it is evident by 1332 (or 1329) that Hadiya had been fully integrated, providing troops for his 1332 campaigns against the Sultanate of Ifat. The King of Hadiya, Amano, refused to visit the Emperor and give his tribute, encouraged by, according to Amda Seyon's chronicler, a Muslim \"prophet of darkness\" named Bel'am. According to the Emperor's Chronicle, Bel'am told him to rebel:\n\nThe Emperor was infuriated, invading Hadiya and killing many people, and taking Amano prisoner along with many of his subjects. Bel'am, however was able to escape the Emperor by fleeing to Ifat. These conquests represented a significant advancement of Amda Seyon's eventual goal of controlling the inland trade previously controlled by the Muslims in Ifat and farther east. Hadiya's conquest deeply affected the slave trade and consequently hurt the trade and wealth of the eastern Muslim provinces. For the first time, the Muslim presence in the region was threatened, which later resulted in alliances between the Muslim provinces (which often rebelled) when they had previously acted more independently of each other.\n\nIn the same year as his campaigns against the southern regions of Damot and Hadiya, the Emperor also campaigned against the more northerly province of Gojjam.\n\nAfter his 1316/7 campaigns in the south, Amda Seyon had to turn north to strengthen his control over areas that had in the meanwhile gained more autonomy. The northern Tigrayan Enderta Province had increasingly been asserting its independence since the Solomonic restoration under Yekuno Amlak in 1270. During Yekuno Amlak's time, the governor of Enderta was Ingida Igzi', who was succeeded by his son, Tesfane Igzi'. As governor of Enderta, Tesfane Igzi' had the most power among the northern provinces and held the title \"Hasgwa\" and \"Aqabé Tsentsen\" ('keeper of the fly whisks – an ancient Aksumite title) and threatened the Amhara-based lineage currently in power. As early as 1305, Tesfane Igzi' referred to Enderta as \"his kingdom,\" his son and successor, Ya'ibika Igzi, did not even mention the Emperor in his 1318/9 land grant. Ya'ibika Igzi eventually rebelled, unsuccessfully inviting the governor of nearby Tembien to join him. Amda Seyon responded swiftly, killing the governor, dividing the titles, and awarding them to different individuals of lowly origin. The Emperor's appointees were unpopular, described as \"men who were not born from Adam and Eve who were called \"Halestiyotat\",\" a term literally meaning \"bastard of mixed or low origins\". To consolidate his control in the region, Amda Seyon established a military colony of non-Tigrayan troops at Amba Senayata, the center of the rebellion, and appointed his Tigrayan queen consort, Bilén Saba, as governor of Enderta, along with a new batch of officials below her. The Queen ruled indirectly, however, which caused some resentment in the province, inducing the Emperor to appoint one of his sons, Bahr Seged, as governor, who was later in 1328 also given control of the maritime provinces under the title of \"Ma'ikele Bahr\" (\"Between the Rivers/Seas\").\n\nIn 1329, the Emperor campaigned in the northern provinces of Semien, Wegera, Tselemt, and Tsegede, in which many had been converting to Judaism and where the Beta Israel had been gaining prominence.\n\nAmda Seyon was also wary of Muslim power along the Red Sea coast and therefore headed to the northern area of Tigray Province bordering the Red Sea: \"I, King Amdä-ṣiyon, went to the sea of Eritrea [i.e. \"Red\"]. When I reached there, I mounted on an elephant and entered the sea. I took up my arrow and spears, killed my enemies, and saved my people.\"\n\nDuring his campaign, the emperor also met the famous monk Ewostatewos, who was on his way to Armenia.\n\nAround 1320, Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad of the Mamluk Sultanate based in Cairo began persecuting Copts and destroying their churches. Amdä Seyon subsequently sent a mission to Cairo in 1321-2 threatening to retaliate against the Muslims in his kingdom and divert the course of the Nile if the sultan did not end his persecution. Though Al-Nasir Muhammad ignored the envoys, fear of the diversion of the Nile in Egypt would continue for centuries. As a result of the dispute and threats, Haqq ad-Din I, governor of Ifat, seized and imprisoned a member of the deputation sent by the Emperor named Ti'yintay on his way back from Cairo. Haqq ad-Din tried to convert Ti`yintay, killing him when this failed. The Emperor responded by invading Ifat accompanied by, according to Amda Seyon's royal chronicler, only seven horsemen, and killed many of the rebelling governor's soldiers. Part of the army then followed him and destroyed the province's capital, Ifat, and Amda Seyon took much of its wealth in the form of gold, silver, bronze, lead, and clothing. Amda Seyon continued his reprisals throughout all of his Muslim provinces, pillaging Kuelgore, Bequlzar, Gidaye, Kubet, Fedsé Qedsé, Hargaye (the latter five yet unidentified), and Shewa, then populated mainly by Muslims, taking livestock, killing many inhabitants, destroying towns, and taking prisoners, who were later assimilated.\n\nAs a result of Amda Seyon's reprisals, other Muslim provinces rebelled, seeing that his army had become weak from the long campaigns. The people of Gebel (or Werjih, today called Worji), reportedly \"very skilled in warfare,\" subsequently revolted and pillaged some Christian regions. The people of Medra Zega and Manzih (Menz), then Muslims, also revolted, surrounding and attacking the Emperor, who defeated them and killed their commander Dedadir, a son of Haqq ad-Din.\n\nThe most important primary source for his reign, \"The Glorious Victories\", describes the extensive military campaigns Amda Seyon undertook in the plains drained by the Awash River. Beginning on 24 Yakatit (18 February), the Emperor led his army against a number of enemies; another document, referring to this year, states that he defeated 10 kings. Rebellion in the Muslim provinces stemmed from the threat to Islam by Amda Seyon, magnified by the earlier loss of trade from his campaigns. This defiance was encouraged and perhaps even instigated by religious leaders in Ifat and other Muslim provinces. The \"false prophet\" reported as having fled from Hadiya during the 1316/7 campaigns continued spreading propaganda against the king in Ifat, where he was one of Sabr ad-Din's advisors. The chronicle states:\nA second religious leader is noted as having fomented trouble in the region, specifically in Adal and Mora. He is called \"Salīh whose title was Qazī\" (which it notes is a title similar to an Archbishop), and is described as being revered and feared like God by the kings and rulers in the region. The chronicle ascribes blame to Salīh, stating that it was he \"who gathered the Muslim troops, kings, and rulers\" against the Emperor.\n\nAs a result of these instigations and conditions, Sabr ad-Din I, governor of Ifat as well as brother and successor to Haqq ad-Din, showed defiance to Amda Seyon by confiscating some of the Emperor's goods in transit from the coast (i.e. Zeila), similar to what his brother had done before him. Amda Seyon was furious with Sabr ad-Din, saying to him, \"You took away the commodities belonging to me obtained in exchange for the large quantity of gold and silver I had entrusted to the merchants... you imprisoned the traders who did business for me.\"\n\nSabr ad-Din's rebellion was not an attempt to achieve independence, but to become emperor of a Muslim Ethiopia. Amda Seyon's royal chronicle states that Sabr ad-Din proclaimed:\n\nIn fact, after his first incursion, Sabr ad-Din appointed governors for nearby and neighboring provinces such as Fetegar and Alamalé (i.e. Aymellel, part of the \"Guragé country\"), as well as far-off provinces in the north like Damot, Amhara, Angot, Inderta, Begemder, and Gojjam. He also threatened to plant \"khat\" at the capital, a stimulant used by Muslims but forbidden to Ethiopian Orthodox Christians.\n\nSabr ad-Din's rebellion, with its religious support and ambitious goals, was therefore seen as a \"jihad\" rather than an attempt at independence, and it was consequently immediately joined by the nearby Muslim province of Dewaro (the first known mention of the province), under the governor Haydera, and the western province of Hadiya under the vassal local ruler Ameno. Sabr ad-Din divided his troops into three parts, sending a division north-westwards to attack Amhara, one northwards to attack Angot, and another, under his personal command, westward to take Shewa.\n\nAmda Seyon subsequently mobilized his soldiers to meet the threat, endowing them with gifts of gold, silver, and lavish clothing – so much so that the chronicler explains that \"in his reign gold and silver abounded like stones and fine clothes were as common as the leaves of the trees or the grass in the fields.\" Despite the extravagance he bestowed on his men, many chose not to fight due to the inhospitability of Ifat's mountainous and arid terrain and the complete absence of roads. Nevertheless, they advanced on 24 Yakatit, and an attachment was able to find the rebellious governor and put him to flight. Once the remainder of Amda Seyon's army arrived, they destroyed the capital and killed many soldiers, but Sabr ad-Din once again escaped. Amda Seyon's forces then grouped together for a final attack, destroying one of his camps, killing many men, women, and children, taking the rest prisoner, as well as looting it of its gold, silver, and its \"fine clothes and jewels without number.\"\n\nSabr ad-Din subsequently sued for peace, appealing to Queen Jan Mengesha, who refused his peace offer and expressed Amda Seyon's determination not to return to his capital until he had searched Sabr ad-Din out. Upon hearing this, Sabr ad-Din realized that his rebellion futile and surrendered himself to Amda Seyon's camp. Amda Seyon's courtiers demanded that Sabr ad-Din be executed, but he instead granted him relative clemency and had the rebellious governor imprisoned. Amda Seyon then appointed the governor's brother, Jamal ad-Din I, as his successor in Ifat. Just as the Ifat rebellion had been quelled, however, the neighboring provinces of Adal and Mora just north of Ifat rose against the Emperor. Amda Seyon soon also put down this rebellion.\n\nAfter much campaigning, Amda Seyon's troops were exhausted and wished to return to their homes, pleading that the rainy season was soon approaching. Amda Seyon refused, however, saying to them:\n\nThe new governor of Ifat also beseeched him to return, giving him many gifts, stating that his country was ruined and begging him not to \"ravage it again,\" so that its inhabitants may recover and work the land for the Emperor. He promised him that if he left that Ifat and its inhabitants would serve the Emperor with their trade and tribute and that he and the Muslims of Ethiopia were the Emperor's servants. Amda Seyon rejected the governor's pleas, declaring:\n\nAmda Seyon continued and was attacked twice in skirmishes before making camp. The Muslims returned during the night in much greater numbers, and attacked him with an army raised from the seven \"great towns\" (i.e. districts) of Adal, Gebela, Lebekela, Mora, Paguma, and Tiqo. During the battle, Amda Seyon was struck from the rear by an enemy's sword, cutting his girdle around his waist and his battle dress, but the Emperor was able to turn and kill the attacker with his spear before he could strike again. Amda Seyon emerged victorious from the battle and sent fresh troops who had not fought to pursue the surviving enemies. They were able to reach the survivors on the banks of a nearby river by morning and kill them, taking many swords, bows, spears, and clothes.\n\nJamal ad-Din, despite being his appointee, also joined the rebellion, collaborating with the ruler of Adel to encircle the Emperor, to which the ruler of Adal responded by mobilizing his forces. The Ethiopian army was encircled by the two armies in the Battle of Das, but Amda Seyon was able to defeat them, despite being ill. He then led his army against Talag, the capital of Adal, where the brother of the governor of Adal and three of the governor's sons surrendered. The Emperor then defeated another governor-king, retraced his steps, returning to Bequlzar in Ifat, where he commanded Jamal ad-Din to deliver him all of the province's apostate Christians. The Emperor was first given the priests, deacons, and soldiers, who were each given 30 lashes and imprisoned as slaves. He then turned to the other traitors, whom Jamal ad-Din refused to hand over. Amda Seyon again ravaged Ifat and deposed Jamal ad-Din, appointing Nasir ad-Din, another brother of Sabr ad-Din, as governor.\n\nHaving finished campaigning in Ifat, he took his army to the town of Gu'ét, where he killed many men and captured numerous women and cattle. The Emperor then invaded the region of modern Northern Somalia, where he defeated an attack by the people of Harla. Amda Seyon then advanced to the town of Dilhoya. The town had previously deposed his governor by immolation, along with other Christian men and women, to which the Emperor responded by taking and looting the town and their livestock, as well as killing many of its inhabitants. He continued to Degwi, killing numerous neighboring Werjih pastoralists, who had previously revolted and pillaged some Christian areas earlier in his reign. The chronicle described the people as \"very wicked,\" as they \"neither knew God nor feared men\".\nBefore the end of the month of December, Amda Seyon ravaged the land of Sharkha and imprisoned its governor Yosef. These efforts extended Ethiopian rule for the first time across the Awash River, gaining control of Dawaro, Bale, and other Muslim states.\n\nTwo different years have been offered for when these extensive military actions occurred is disputed. In his translation of \"The Glorious Victories\", G.W.B. Huntingford follows James Bruce in placing this in 1329. Huntingford notes that Amda Seyon is recorded as celebrating Easter on 28 Miyazya (= 24 April in 1329), which would best fit that year. However, the generally accepted year for this campaign is 1332, which is the opinion of such authorities as August Dillmann, Carlo Conti Rossini, and Enrico Cerulli. Taddesse Tamrat points to another document which dates Amda Seyon's 18th regnal year to 498 Year of Grace, which confirms that the year 516 in \"The Glorious Victories\" is correct and that the campaigns took place in AD 1332.\n\nTrade flourished under Amda Seyon. Archeological investigations in the treasuries of Ethiopian churches and monasteries have recovered coins, textiles and other objects that prove the existence of trade with the Byzantine Empire. Taddesse Tamrat also notes that he had a Syrian secretary from a Christian family of Damascus, who helped him keep in close touch with events in the Middle East.\n\nSome of the earliest works of Ethiopian literature were written during Amda Seyon's reign. Perhaps the best known is the Kebra Nagast, which was translated from Arabic at the request of Yaebika Egzi'e, governor of Inderta. Other works from this period include the \"Mashafa Mestira Samay Wamedr\" (\"The Book of the Mysteries of Heaven and Earth\") written by Giyorgis of Segla, and the \"Zena Eskender\" (\"History of Alexander the Great\"), a romance wherein Alexander the Great becomes a Christian saint. Ullendorff has identified a tradition that at this time the Ge'ez translation of the Bible was revised. Also worth mentioning is that four of the \"Soldiers Songs\" were composed during the reign of Amda Seyon, and are the earliest existing examples of Amharic. Lastly, Amda Seyon is the first king recorded as having donated to the library of the Ethiopian community at Jerusalem.\n\n\na. Taddesse Tamrat notes that, according to Jules Perruchon, \"Tekula\" literally means \"jackal,\" while \"Qeste-Nihb\" means \"the sting of the bee.\"<br>\nb. Seeing many of his soldiers flee at the sight of the powerful armies of Jamal ad-Din and of Adal, the sick Amda Seyon noted: \"Have you forgotten, besides, that it was I who raised, you, nourished you, and covered you with ornaments of gold and silver and precious clothes!\"<br>\nc. Simshehal's name also appears as \"Semey\" in a list of governors with the title \"Ma'ikele-Bahr\" (lit. \"between the rivers/seas,\" a northern maritime province) and in the Royal chronicle as \"Sumey (-shehal)\" and \"Simiy (-shihal).\" Inze-Aygab also appears once as \"Yanz-Aygeb.\"<br>\nd. According to Taddesse Tamrat, though the royal chronicle describes Amda Seyon as being armed with a sword, the chronicler only refers to the Emperors skill with the bow and arrow, spear, and shield; Taddesse further notes in a footnote that swords seem to only be used in a ceremonial manner in contemporary hagiographies.<br>\ne.

When Abuna Yaqob and the monastic leaders protested, the Emperor sent the Abuna back to Egypt, and exiled the monks to the southern parts of his kingdom.\n\nDuring his reign Ali ibn Sabr ad-Din of the Walashma dynasty revolted. In response, Newaya Krestos campaigned along the eastern frontier of Ethiopia in the territories of Adal and Ifat. Due to lack of support from his subjects, Ali ad-Din's revolt was unsuccessful, and he was captured with all of his sons, effectively destroying the Sultanate of Ifat as an independent state. Newaya Krestos imprisoned Ali ad-Din and all of his sons except for Ahmad, whom the emperor made governor of Ifat. However, after eight years Ali was released from prison and returned to power; Ahmad and his sons were excluded from power, and it took the direct intervention of the Emperor for Ahmad to obtain a position over a single district.\n\nDespite his earlier actions against the Ethiopian Church, towards the end of his reign he aggressively helped the Patriarch of Alexandria Mark IV, who had been imprisoned by Al-Salih, the Sultan of Egypt. One step Newaya Krestos took was to imprison the Egyptian merchants in his kingdom; the other was to march on Egypt at the head of a numerous army. Tradition states that Patriarch Mark was freed and sent a delegation to convince the Emperor to return to his kingdom. Newaya Krestos did return, but he kept the delegation with him as his unwilling guests.\n\nNewaya Krestos is also credited for rebuilding the ancient church Debre Igziabher that overlooks Lake Hayq. The structure was pillaged and burned by Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi's forces in 1531. Copies of three charters first composed during his reign survive, which G.W.B. Huntingford uses as evidence that his rule extended as far north as Serae and Tigray.\n"}

So far she has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to be named \"Tradewind\", after the Trade winds.\n\nShe spent most of her wartime career operating against the Japanese in the Far East, attacking enemy shipping and laying mines. She sank nine Japanese sailing vessels, and two small unidentified Japanese vessels, a Japanese tug and the Japanese merchant tanker \"Takasago Maru\". The Japanese merchant cargo vessel \"Kyokko Maru\" was sunk after hitting a mine laid by \"Tradewind\".\n\nHer most infamous sinking was of the Japanese army cargo ship \"Junyō Maru\" which was headed for Sumatra, on 18 September 1944. Unbeknown to the Commanding Officer of \"Tradewind\", Lt.Cdr. Lynch Maydon, the Japanese ship was carrying 4,200 Javanese slave labourers and 2,300 Allied prisoners of war from Batavia to Padang. 5,620 lives were lost in the sinking.\n\n\"Tradewind\" survived the war and was modified in July 1945-September 1946 to become an acoustic trials submarine and used for tests. The modifications included the removal of external torpedo tubes and guns, the bridge was faired, the hull streamlined and some internal torpedo tubes blanked over. Measurements made using \"Tradewind\" were used to overhaul several of the \"T\" class boats to increase their ability to act stealthily against Soviet submarines and surface ships.\n\nIn 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

It is nonvenomous, colored yellow and black. The desert kingsnake's diet consists of rodents, lizards, and smaller snakes, including rattlesnakes. They normally grow 3–4 feet long but have been known to grow up to 6.8 feet. They are docile creatures when coming face to face with humans. If they do not try to escape, often they will \"play dead\" by flipping over onto their backs and lying motionless. Some who domesticate kingsnakes, such as ranchers, do so in the hopes that the kingsnakes will feed on other snakes which might present more of a threat. It was previously considered a subspecies of the common kingsnake.\n\nThe snake's glossy dorsum is black or very dark brown colored, finely speckled with off-white or yellow. These pale flecks form dimly-defined narrow vertebral crossbands, between which the intervening rectangular areas are black. Pale yellow scales may predominate along the lower sides. The abdomen of both adult and young snakes is mostly black, with white or pale yellow blotches marking the outer ends of the ventral plates. The smooth dorsal scales are arranged in 23 to 25 rows at midbody and the anal plate is undivided.\n\nThe desert kingsnake may occur in any rural habitat within its range. Despite its common name, it is most likely to be found in mesic areas, especially near water tanks or within riparian corridors.\n\nThis snake is known to be a powerful constrictor, and therefore its diet consists of mostly mice if domestic, and other rodents if wild. It also can feed on clutches of reptile eggs detected beneath the surface via smell. In part because of its resistance to pitviper venom, the desert kingsnake is able to consume young diamondback rattlesnakes that are common within its range, and at the scent of \"L. getula\" even adult western diamondbacks edge hastily backward, shielding their heads with defensive loops.\n\nAs with most reptiles, \"L. splendida\" lays eggs. Courtship and copulation occurs between the months of March and June, with clutches of 5 to 12 adhesive-surfaced eggs deposited in late June or July, sometimes buried as deeply as a foot to prevent drying through their moisture-permeable shells. After about 60 days of incubation the 8- to 10-inch long hatchlings, weighing about a fifth of an ounce, emerge. Brightly yellow-speckled in vertebral cross-lines, they also exhibit a lateral row of large, dark brown spots which, as they mature, are gradually fragmented by encroaching yellow flecks.\n"}

Toledo served as the head coach at University of California, Riverside (1974–1975), the University of the Pacific (1979–1982), the University of California, Los Angeles (1996–2002), and Tulane University (2007–2011). He resigned as head football coach at Tulane on October 18, 2011. On January 10, 2013, he was named offensive coordinator at San Diego State. Toledo retired from coaching after the 2014 season.\n\nToledo played football at Lincoln High School in San Jose, California. He was the starting quarterback from 1961 to 1963. Toledo played for San Jose State during the 1964 season. In 1965, Toledo transferred to San Jose City College, where he was the starting quarterback and was a junior college All-American. Toledo was the starting quarterback for the San Francisco State Gators during the 1966 and 1967 seasons. While at SFSU, the team went 16–5 and played in the 1967 Camellia Bowl, a defeat against Don Coryell's San Diego State Aztecs. Toledo graduated from San Francisco State in 1968 and then tried out for the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nPrior to coaching at the University of California, Riverside, Toledo was a head coach at Archbishop Riordan High School in San Francisco. He coached the freshman team in 1969, and the varsity team from 1970 to 1972. Toledo was the offensive coordinator for UC-Riverside in the 1973 season. In his first collegiate head coaching job, Toledo led UC-Riverside to a 15–6 record from 1974 to 1975. When UC-Riverside ended its football program after the 1975 season, Toledo worked as an assistant to John Robinson at USC. Toledo's second head coaching position was at the University of the Pacific from 1979 to 1982. At Pacific, his teams compiled a 14–30 overall record in those four years. After leaving the Pacific program, he worked from 1983 to 1988 as the assistant head coach and offensive coordinator at the University of Oregon. He assisted R. C. Slocum as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Texas A&M, starting in 1989, until he was hired as offensive coordinator at UCLA for the 1994 and 1995 seasons. As the head coach at UCLA from 1996 until 2002, Toledo went 49–32 overall and 32–24 in conference play. The 2003 football season represented the first time since before high school that Toledo was neither playing nor coaching football. Toledo was the assistant head coach and offensive coordinator for the University of New Mexico in 2006, and was the head coach at Tulane from 2007 to 2011.\n\nIn 1996, his first season as head coach with UCLA, the team finished with a mediocre 5–6 record. The highlight of the season was a comeback win over USC.\n\nThe 1997 team finished as co-champions of the Pacific-10 Conference with Washington State. However, with Washington State defeating the Bruins in the season opener, the Cougars earned the right to play in the Rose Bowl. The highlights of that season were a 66–3 win over the University of Texas and a victory at the Cotton Bowl Classic over Texas A&M, and a victory over USC.\n\nThe 1998 season started out as one of the best in the history of UCLA football. The team was high enough in the BCS standings to merit entry to the national championship game, and all UCLA needed to do was beat unranked Miami, who were major underdogs after a 66–13 loss to Syracuse the week before. UCLA was also coming off of their eighth consecutive victory over USC and 20th straight win overall. However, Miami won 49–45, ending UCLA's chances of playing in the national championship game. They instead settled for a trip to the Rose Bowl as Pac-10 champions, but lost to Wisconsin. This is seen as the turning point for both UCLA and USC's football programs.\n\nThe 1999 season was a major disappointment, with the team finishing 4–7. This was the first year that USC had defeated them in the annual Battle for the Victory Bell since 1990. The year also had the dubious distinction of a 55–7 loss to Pac-10 foe Oregon State, the worst defeat of the Bruins in 69 years.\n\nIn 2000, the Bruins finished 6–6 with a loss in the Sun Bowl, again against Wisconsin.\n\nThe 2001 season started with promise as the Bruins got off to a fast start with a 6–0 record. However, four straight losses to Stanford, Washington State, Oregon, and USC, the Bruins faded out of postseason contention.\n\nUCLA finished off 8–5 in Toledo's final season in 2002. The team finished 7–5 in the regular season, but Toledo was fired after a fourth straight loss to USC. The Bruins did reach the Las Vegas Bowl, but interim coach Ed Kezirian coached—and won—his only game in charge of the program.\n\nToledo was the head coach at UCLA for seven years from 1996 to 2002. He finished with a record of 49 wins and 32 losses, for a winning percentage of .605, including one winning streak of 20 consecutive victories, a school record. Toledo's greatest accomplishment with the team may have been in the 1997 season, where the team finished 10–2 with a victory over Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl Classic. Toledo was 3–4 against UCLA's cross-town rival, the USC Trojans in the UCLA–USC rivalry.\n\nIn 2006, Toledo returned to college football after a three-year absence becoming the offensive coordinator of the University of New Mexico Lobos, under head coach Rocky Long who had previously been Toledo's defensive coordinator at UCLA for the 1996 and 1997 seasons. In addition to being the offensive coordinator, Toledo was also the associate head coach and quarterbacks coach.\n\nIn December 2006, Toledo was named the new head football coach at Tulane, replacing Chris Scelfo. The team finished with a record of four wins and eight losses in Toledo's first season as coach. His first year also saw the development of Matt Forte, who came off a knee injury to rush for 2,127 yards and 23 touchdowns.\n\nToledo resigned as head football coach at Tulane on October 18, 2011, and was replaced on an interim basis by co-offensive coordinator Mark Hutson.\n\n"}
{"id": "1813748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1813748", "title": "Scarecrow (novel)", "text": "Scarecrow (novel)\n\nScarecrow is the fifth Matthew Reilly novel, and the third to feature the main character Captain Shane Schofield, USMC. It was released in 2003.\n\nMajestic-12, a group of the world's richest men, make up a bounty list of fifteen targets that have to be eliminated before 12 noon of October 26. Among the targets is Shane Schofield, who at that moment is on a mission in Siberia with Book II and a group of U.S. Marines. Schofield's team is supposed to meet up with two Delta groups, the leaders of the which are also on M-12's hit list. Schofield's unit comes under fire from a group of bounty hunters led by Cedric Wexley and all but Schofield and Book II are killed. Schofield and Book II escape via a hijacked plane owned by a bounty hunter known as the Hungarian.\n\nMeanwhile, in Afghanistan, Schofield's girlfriend Elizabeth Gant leads a group of Marines, along with Mother, to a cave system where Osama bin Laden's number two man is. Schofield races to Afghanistan to find Gant so that none of the bounty hunters can use her to get to him, but arrives too late to save her and she gets captured by a bounty hunter group known as IG-88, led by Damon \"Demon\" Larkham. Schofield meets a bounty hunter named Aloysius Knight who has been paid to protect him and teams up with him. Knight and Schofield go to save Gant while Book II and Mother go to London to confront another person on the hit list.\n\nMeanwhile, the other people on the hit list are being taken out. Schofield's friend David Fairfax goes to help one of them but the man he is going to help is killed, as is the person Book II and Mother are attempting to meet. Schofield, Knight, and Gant disguise themselves as bounty hunters to get into a castle owned by Jonathan Killian, one of the men in Majestic-12, to find out more about the bounty hunt. While Knight claims the bounty on two heads, Killian sets a trap for Schofield and Gant, forcing them to escape in one of Killian's cars with Wexley's men in hot pursuit, followed by Knight in his Sukhoi . Schofield goes over a cliff and is presumed dead while Knight and Gant are captured. \nMother is picked up by Rufus, Knight's pilot, and goes to help Knight while Schofield is captured by French soldiers and brought to an aircraft carrier to explain to him why he is to be terminated. At Killian's castle, Gant is brutally murdered on a guillotine. However, Knight escapes, Gant's final words being for Knight to tell Schofield she would have said yes to his planned proposal. Rufus, Mother, and Knight go to rescue Schofield.\n\nOn the French aircraft carrier, it is revealed that Schofield, along with the fifteen other targets, are the only people who have quick enough reactions to disable the missiles being launched from disguised ships in the Kormoran Project. The plan involves copies of different countries' missiles being launched at their bitterest enemies, resulting in a new Cold War which will bring in huge profits for the members of Majestic-12. Schofield is rescued by Knight, but then Knight reveals to him that Gant was decapitated.\n\nSaddened by Gant's death, Schofield attempts to commit suicide but is stopped by Mother. in the meantime, the President of the United States gives all of the U.S. Armed Forces' resources to Schofield to neutralize the threat posed by the ships. He then directs certain ships to be sunk using torpedoes. At the same time, Fairfax and Book II are flown to different ships so that Schofield can disable all of the missiles at the same time. Schofield succeeds in disabling the missiles, but Mother is presumed to have perished. Schofield later learns that there is a backup plan and a missile is heading right for Mecca on the first day of Ramadan. Schofield is able to deactivate the missile but in turn, M-12 captures Schofield, Rufus, and Knight.\n\nSchofield is about to be killed in the same way and by the same person as Gant was but Mother reveals herself to be alive and Schofield kills Gant's killer while Rufus is injured. Knight and Schofield go to confront Killian and Wexley is killed too. Schofield throws himself and Killian out of a window in a suicide attempt, but Knight saves Schofield.\n\nSeveral months later, Knight and Rufus meet the person who hired them, Lillian Mattencourt, the richest woman on the planet, who ruined M-12s plan because they would not let her be part of the group as she was a woman. It is also revealed that the rest of M-12 died in mysterious ways. Demon and the IG-88 kill Knight's payer as revenge for taking two of their bounties during the hunt. Later, at Mother's house, Schofield receives a letter from Knight telling him to accept Gant's death and move on. Schofield then goes to the Marine Corps building and says he's ready for duty again.\n\nOnly in his early thirties, Captain Schofield is renowned for his level-headed demeanor and reflexes that afford him the ability to come out of devastating conflict alive. His callsign comes from two vertical scars that run from his eyebrows to his cheeks, over his eyes, wounds he sustained while he was a Harrier pilot for the Marine Corps in Serbia. Although his rank is well below many others in the story, he frequently takes command of the entire United States military; the President personally agreeing to this due to Schofield having saved his life the preceding year. Often resorting to very dangerous strategies to win a battle, it has become the norm for any attempt on his life to end with him escaping while the surrounding environment is more or less demolished. He commands a recon unit of Marines called to aid the Russian government - a trap designed to lead to his death. Upon discovering M-12's plot to change world order, he embarks upon a campaign to ruin the Chameleon and Kormoran projects. He is the protagonist in four Matthew Reilly novels and a novella, Scarecrow being the third novel.\n\nGant is Schofield's girlfriend (whom he started dating just before Area 7), and a Marine Lieutenant. It is revealed that Schofield intended to propose to her soon. Gant's callsign was bestowed upon her by admiring male colleagues due to her athletic figure and attractive features. Unlike Schofield and Mother, Gant has neither lightning-fast reflexes nor sheer brute strength and as a result has been seriously injured several times before. That said, she has proven more than capable of holding her own in fire fights and hand-to-hand combat in all three Schofield novels. Due to a Marine Corps policy, she has been placed in the command of her own unit, rather than in Schofield's. Her other nickname is Dorothy, in reference to the Wizard of Oz, as Gant is in love with Schofield (the Scarecrow), and in The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy likes the scarecrow the most. Gant is viciously beheaded via a guillotine in Killian's Forteresse de Valois by Noonan, an ISS operative working with M-12. Her execution at first drives Schofield to attempt suicide twice, both times failing to do so, but then prompts him to seek vengeance. Gant is a primary character in the first three Scarecrow novels.\n\nThirty-four years old, 6'4\" in height with a fully shaved head and weighing in at over 200 lbs, Mother's callsign is not meant to convey maternal qualities - rather it is short for Motherfucker. She is ordinarily under the command of Schofield, but begins the story instead as Gunnery-Sergeant to Libby Gant. An encounter with a killer whale in Ice Station has left her with a prosthetic left leg from the knee down (it has served not only to provide mobility but to save her life frequently). Fiercely loyal to Schofield and possessed of a similar luck which has allowed her to survive several near-death experiences- to the extent that it is commented towards the end of the novel that the Grim Reaper, if he exists, is only afraid of Mother-, Mother opts for a violent solution more readily than her unit leader. Her short temper and eccentric nature lead her to many hand-to-hand fights with adversaries often even larger than her. Possessed of a sarcastic wit, she is also the helpful best friend to Gant, often offering advice or insight into her relationship with Schofield. Although in awe of Schofield's achievements- to the point where she has never referred to him as anything other than 'Scarecrow' as she regards him as more than a normal man-, she has managed to evade certain death many times herself and is indispensable to Schofield, both as a soldier and a friend. Mother is a primary character in all four Scarecrow pieces.\n\nA bounty hunter hired to protect the \"Scarecrow\", Aloysius (Pronounced allo-wishus) \"Black\" Knight was a captain within Delta Team 7, regarded as the \"elite within the elite\" of the special forces. He became a fugitive from the US during a mission in Sudan, in which he was infiltrating an arms deal involving Osama bin Laden. Despite being in shooting range of the terrorist, Knight was ordered not to attack, allowing the terrorist to escape while Knight was forced to wait for reinforcements. Later, while preparing to board a Black Hawk piloted by his friend Rufus, he overhears his backup being ordered to kill him and his pilot. He finds out later that the men belong to the ICG (Intelligence Convergence Group), a complex web of civilian and military spies whose job is to ensure all intelligence obtained by the United States of America stays solely within the United States of America. He escaped, along with Rufus, and killed 13 of the men pursuing him. He was consequently placed on the FBI Most Wanted List and his family killed in a supposedly botched home invasion. He turned to being a mercenary and after successfully rescuing the daughter of the Russian Vice-President, was given a fighter jet known as the \"Black Raven\" which Rufus pilots for him, as well as landing privileges at any Russian airfield. He is regarded as the second best bounty hunter in the world after \"Demon\" Larkham. More than tall, he dresses entirely in black, in keeping to his call sign \"Black Knight\". Due to an eye disorder, photophobia, he must wear tinted lenses at all times. This weakness is sometimes exploited by others, as removing his shades will cause him to experience immense pain.\n\nIt was revealed by Matthew Reilly that the Black Knight was meant to be a dark double to Scarecrow; he also has an eye problem and has had his disagreements with the US government. This is even mentioned in the book, when Mother (upon hearing his biography) remarks that he sounds like a Shane Schofield gone wrong.\n\nBook II's father, Book, was a loyal friend of Schofield who was killed in the first Scarecrow novel \"Ice Station\". Although initially there was friction between him and Schofield over the death of his father, he has warmed to his new superior and is less cold and brooding than he first was upon joining Schofield's ranks in \"Area 7\". Due to his resemblance to his father he earned the callsign Book II. 25 years old, with a heavy browed face and pug nose, he is described as a \"tough-as-nails warrior\". Quieter and composed than the others within his regiment, his level-head affords him Scarecrow's respect. Other than Scarecrow he is the only marine to survive the trap in Siberia at the beginning of the novel. Less inclined to combat than Knight and especially Mother, he is very capable of deduction and serves as an accurate information gatherer for Schofield after managing to secure files on M-12 within the Mossad headquarters. Along with David Fairfax he provides Scarecrow with a long-distance electronic link to the Kormoran supertankers, allowing Scarecrow to disarm several missiles from the other side of the world.\n\nAfter completing the first draft of his most recent book \"The Five Greatest Warriors\", Matthew Reilly was engaged by a Hollywood producer to adapt Scarecrow into a screenplay. It is to be the first in a series of Shane Schofield movies which Matthew Reilly says is okay with him \"but structurally it means introducing characters like Scarecrow and Mother and Book and Fox within the framework of the story in Scarecrow, as opposed to (the prequel) \"Ice Station\"\".\n\n\n"}

A 1955 plan suggested this routing:\n\nThe project was canceled in 1971 after intense protests organized by community activists, and following Gov. Francis Sargent's 1970 moratorium on highway construction inside Route 128. It would have displaced some 7,000 people from their homes and created what opponents at the time called a \"Chinese wall\" dividing long established neighborhoods, and would have gutted large parts of the city of Cambridge and the Boston neighborhood of Roxbury. There was also speculation that the construction of the Inner Belt would essentially bypass downtown Boston completely, resulting in economic stagnation in a city that was already having considerable financial problems. It was one of the first large highway projects to be blocked by local opposition. Unresolved traffic problems resulting from the cancellation were among the factors eventually leading to Boston's Big Dig highway project, decades later.\n\nThe Northwest Expressway was to carry Routes 2 and 3 along a four-lane highway from the north-west (the current outer intersection of U.S. 3 and Route 128 in Burlington) via Cambridge to connect with the Inner Belt in Union Square, Somerville. Instead, the Route 2 highway was never re-routed to the Fitchburg Line right of way, and alternately now terminates along the right of way of the old Concord Turnpike (Route 2). That intersection left the highway terminating at a traffic circle in northwest Cambridge, where it intersected Route 16. In the 1980s, the rotary was replaced by a traffic light and the highway was connected to the park-and-ride garage at the Alewife station on the newly extended Red Line.\n\nAn outer belt, Interstate 495, was completed by 1982 around Greater Boston.\n\nWith the cancellation of the \"Southwest Corridor\" route for I-95, and the resultant alternate usage of much of that right-of-way for a significant length of the relocated southwest section of the MBTA Orange Line subway's above-ground run, Route 128 between I-95 South and I-95 North was made part of the Interstate system as I-95. The right-of-way for the I-695 portion of the beltway in Roxbury had already been cleared and now contains an arterial road, Melnea Cass Boulevard. The former Southwest Corridor portion of the right of way was converted into Southwest Corridor Park and the new route for the new depressed southern section of Boston's Orange Line subway, from the Tufts Medical Center subway station south-westwards. The older elevated Orange line right of way along Washington Street was subsequently torn down by 1987, and eventually replaced by the Silver Line rapid bus service.\n\nRemnants of the Inner Belt were visible for many years on Interstate 93 at what is now the Storrow Drive Connector interchange (Exit 26 southbound) in Somerville (which would have been the northern terminus of I-695) and at the Massachusetts Avenue interchange in Boston (which would have been the Route 3/I-95 junction at the southern terminus of the beltway). Some, but not all, of these remnants have been demolished as part of the Big Dig; in particular, the Leverett Connector uses the northern pair of ramps in Somerville and had to be built around the southern pair of ramps. A still-extant, but barricaded spur just north of the new Zakim Bridge on both levels of I-93 North was intended to connect to the Inner Belt.\n\nAn industrial park in Somerville, built on the remnants of the B&M's Yard 8, near the intended northern terminus of the highway is built around a street known as \"Inner Belt Road\".\n\n"}

He was the younger son of Newaya Krestos.\n\nTaddesse Tamrat discusses a tradition that early in his reign, Dawit campaigned against Egypt, reaching as far north as Aswan. In response, the Emir forced the Patriarch of Alexandria, Matthew I, to send a deputation to Dawit to persuade him to retire back to his kingdom. Taddesse concludes, \"There seems to be little or no doubt that, on the eve of the advent of the Burji dynasty of Mamluk Egypt, King Dawit had in fact led his troops beyond the northern frontiers of his kingdom, and created much havoc among the Muslim inhabitants of the area who had been within the sphere of influence of Egypt since the thirteenth century.\" The Emperor apparently had a much friendlier relationship with the Sultan's successor, for according to the medieval historian al-Maqrizi, Dawit sent 22 camels laden with gifts to Berkuk, the first Sultan of the Burji dynasty.\n\nHe confronted the problem of raids from the Muslim kingdoms on his eastern border with numerous counterattacks on those kingdoms. According to al-Maqrizi, in 1403 Emperor Dawit pursued the Sultan of Adal, Sa'ad ad-Din II, to Zeila, where he killed Sa'ad ad-Din and sacked the city. However, another contemporary source dates the death of Sa'ad ad-Din to 1415, and gives the credit to Emperor Yeshaq.\n\nDawit sent an embassy to Europe, which had reached Venice by 23 June 1402, requesting that a number of artisans are sent to his domain. Carlo Conti Rossini assembled the surviving documents concerning this visit in 1927, which record that five artisans departed with the Ethiopian envoy that August, but not if they arrived in Ethiopia. However, Marilyn E. Heldman found evidence of a \"silver-gilt chalice\" made in Venice, which, if it was the one Francisco Álvares described as seeing in Ethiopia, did reach Dawit. Another possible sign of their arrival is an itinerary of a journey from Venice by Rhodes, Cyprus, Jerusalem, Cairo and Axum to the court of Preste John in Shewa. which O. G. S. Crawford dates to Dawit's reign. Crawford considers this document the \"first unambiguous account of Abyssinian geography which has survived; it certainly refers to the journey of a European, and the route followed can be identified pretty accurately.\"\n\nA noted horseman, Dawit was killed when he was kicked in the head by one of his horses. His body was interred in the monastery of St. Stephen on Daga Island in Lake Tana.\n\nThe Emperor Dawit was an enthusiastic Christian. He dealt with a revolt of the Beta Israel in Tigray, and encouraged missionary work in Gojjam. According to E. A. Wallis Budge, during Dawit's reign, a piece of the True Cross arrived in Ethiopia. He also made endowments to the Ethiopian Church: three charters survive of grants he made of lands in Wolqayt, Serae, Adiyabo, Shire, Addi Arkay, northern Semien, the Gar'alta, Manbarta, and Karnesem which lies north of present-day Asmara.\n\nDuring Dawit's time atop the throne, two surviving examples of illustrated manuscripts were produced. One is a translation of the \"Miracles of Mary\", which had been written in Arabic, done at the command of Emperor Dawit. This is the oldest surviving illustrated book commissioned by an Ethiopian Emperor. The other, described as \"one of the most beautiful illustrated books of the period\", is a copy of the gospels, which is now preserved at the monastery of Saint Gabriel on Kebran Island in southern Lake Tana.\n"}

The Benefactors' Law requires the \"Destruction of all intelligences responsible for or associated with the manufacture of self-replicating and destructive devices.\" The book is written almost entirely from the point of view of a central character, Martin Gordon, known as Martin Spruce, who is the son of a central character in \"The Forge of God\", Arthur Gordon.

The Killers, when they are discovered, have formidable philosophical defenses in addition to their vast technological resources. They have created hundreds of sapient races, interlocked in a culture of breathtaking complexity and beauty. The execution of justice falls to children of the destroyed planets.

The center opened on September 19, 2004, replacing the former Civic Center. In addition to several theaters, the center also houses the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art.\n\nThe center was commissioned by Jerome Frautschi and Pleasant Rowland, designed by Cesar Pelli. Perhaps his most famous works are the Petronas Twin Towers, which were for a time the world's tallest buildings. He also designed the World Financial Center complex (since renamed Brookfield Place, in downtown Manhattan. Frautschi/Rowland paid $205 million to construct the building, making it the largest private gift to the arts of its kind. It replaced the Madison Civic Center, located on the same block on State Street. Its first President/CEO was Robert B. D'Angelo, followed by Michael Goldberg, Tom Carto, Ted DeDee and Sandra Gajic.\n\nThe building has seven venues, in addition to art galleries:\n\nThe 2251-seat Overture Hall is the facility's largest theater. Consisting of four levels of seats, it has a striking architectural style and was designed for acoustics (no center aisle). The balconies have \"continental-style\" seating arrangements, where aisles other than those on the sides of seat rows are omitted in order to provide greater seat size and acoustics. It houses a large, permanent organ by the German organ builder Klais. The Madison Symphony Orchestra, Madison Opera, and Madison Ballet call this theater home. In addition to local Madison performing groups, touring performances have played in Overture Hall; comedian Jerry Seinfeld and musician Yo-Yo Ma are examples of nationally famous performers who have appeared here.\n\nDuring Overture construction, the Oscar Mayer Theater (originally named Capitol Theater, which opened 1928 as a movie palace) was restored, downsized, and re-christened the Capitol Theater. The theater's inaugural performance, Wisconsin Chamber Orchestra, upon reopening took place in November, 2005. Done in muted teal and fuchsia, it seats 1098 in the main floor and balcony. Original to the theater is an organ built by Oshkosh's Barton Organ Company. Resident companies include the Wisconsin Chamber Orchestra and CTM Madison Family Theatre, although some traveling shows (usually concerts) regularly perform there.\n\nThis smaller, intimate performance space replaced the former Isthmus Playhouse. It was renovated with the Madison Repertory Theatre in mind as its resident company, and was occupied by Madison Rep until its closure in March 2009.\n\nThis is a smaller room featuring bleachers in the walls that can convert it to a performance space seating up to 300. Kanopy Dance is its resident company.\n\nThis room, located in the lower level, is used primarily for the center's Kids in the Rotunda performances. The only venue accessible to the public during regular hours, it features a color scheme of fuchsia walls and floors, as well as permanent audience riser seats. It is also a venue for banquets, meetings and other performances.\n\nThese two venues are used mainly for rehearsals and meetings. They are also fully equipped black box theater spaces seating 100-200 depending on seating configuration.\n\nThe center contains four visual art galleries. The Overture Galleries present exhibits by local and state artists and organizations.\n\nThe center houses the James Watrous Gallery, which is operated by the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters. This gallery displays larger exhibits and installations from regional artists.\n\nBoth galleries are open to the public.\n\nFollowing is a partial list of notable performers that have staged concerts at the Overture Center:\n\nThe Overture Center has been the subject of several controversies. After Frautschi's/Rowland's initial gift of a $100 million, they donated another $100 million, to make this a state of the art venue. Some citizens complained that the City of Madison's priorities were skewed. Others said the project would hurt the image of nearby State Street. Still others believed it would be accessible only to the wealthy while limiting access to local and smaller acts and artists.\n\nAfter initial construction of the center, concerns were raised over additional funding. Citizens became concerned that as the economy slowed Overture's reserve funds would decrease. As this happened, the potential was raised for the City of Madison to step in to maintain funding levels. Some were worried that a project that was supposed to be private would become an unnecessary burden to taxpayers. These fears were exacerbated by the liquidation of the trust fund that was set up to pay the construction debt for the building as well as provide some operating income. The liquidation left some construction debt that was paid for by Gerry Frautschi, (Webcrafters), Pleasant Rowland (founder of American Girls), and a number of their friends. The endowment liquidations forced the center to cut staff because of the loss of the operating income. The Overture Center continues to be a privately owned facility and is now run by a non-profit; it is no longer a City of Madison agency. The Center receives an annual subsidy from the city approximately equal to that which the Madison Civic Center received (a facility owned by the city). With an estimated operating budget of $18.4 million (fiscal year July to June 2012-13) Overture Center seems to have emerged from its financial difficulty. Staffing levels now exceed the level before the forced endowment liquidation.\n\nWhen a touring production of Miss Saigon was scheduled to play at Overture in April of 2019, local scholars and members of the Asian American community voiced concerns about the show's content; Overture staff worked with this group to organize a panel prior to the production titled, \"Asian American Perspectives on ‘Miss Saigon’: Stereotypes, History and Community.\" In the days before the event, Overture added a panelist from a local theatre company at the expense of one of the Asian American scholars who helped to organize the panel, Lori Kido Lopez, an expert in Asian American portrayals in media and entertainment. Furthermore, the panel's original context of providing an Asian American perspective was altered with the event re-titled, \"Perspectives on Miss Saigon: History and Community\". In addition to Kido-Lopez being removed from the lineup, a program note written by panelist and scholar Timothy Yu was no longer going to be included. Overture also informed the panelists that the questions which had been previously prepared by scholar and moderator Leslie Bow would not be used; Overture was, \"going to ask their own questions.\" Bow's original set of questions included \"How do plays like this impact American impressions about Vietnamese people?\", \"Do you think that the southeast Asian community will find this show appealing?\", \"Who is responsible for bringing diverse stories and productions to the stage?\" and, \"How might theatre contribute to racial awareness?\" Overture's President/CEO Sandra Gajic, described these questions as \"inflammatory.\" \n\nThe day of the event, the panel was cancelled by Overture, citing the fear that the panel made up of scholars was \"becoming more of a lecture than a dialogue\" according to a press release from Ed Holmes, Overture's Senior Vice President for Equity and Innovation. The Asian American panelists then held a \"teach in\" outside of Overture in protest. Overture attempted to reschedule the panel, but only after the production was over for several weeks; the original Asian American panelists declined to participate.\n\nAs a result of the growing controversy, Gajic, who had taken over the job of Overture CEO after \"Miss Saigon\" had been selected to come to Overture's season, offered a public apology via social media. Gajic came under fire for allegedly lying to a local reporter about Yu's essay, claiming that, \"a program insert was never an option.\" Yu provided an email showing that Overture had offered Yu two pages in the \"Miss Saigon\" program for an essay about the show's context. Lex Poppens, Overture's Vice President of Sales revealed that contrary to Gajic's claim, Overture had offered Yu \"the opportunity to write two pages in the program book. And he did submit the pages\". Poppens stated that the producing company, Broadway Across America, did not approve of the essay being placed in the program. Gajic made a second apology through a local newspaper on April 1st, calling the cancellation a \"regretful mistake\" and claiming that the uproar had triggered a more critical look at future programing. Later that day, a local university, Edgewood College announced that they had cancelled plans to attend the production due to the increased awareness of the show's content, voicing the desire to provide, \"inclusive events\" for students.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1813799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1813799", "title": "Paul Naschy", "text": "Paul Naschy\n\nPaul Naschy (born Jacinto Molina Álvarez, September 6, 1934 – November 30, 2009) was a Spanish movie actor, screenwriter, and director working primarily in horror films. His portrayals of numerous classic horror figures—The Wolfman, Frankenstein's monster, Count Dracula, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Fu Manchu and a mummy—earned him recognition as the Spanish Lon Chaney. He had one of the most recognizable faces in Spanish horror film. Naschy also starred in dozens of action films, historical dramas, crime movies, TV shows and documentaries. He also wrote the screenplays for most of his films and directed a number of them as well. King Juan Carlos I presented Naschy with Spain's Gold Medal Award for Fine Arts in 2001 in honor of his work, the Spanish equivalent of being knighted.\n\nNaschy was born as Jacinto Molina Alvarez in Madrid in 1934, and grew up during the Spanish Civil War, a period of great turmoil in Spanish history. His father Enrique Molina was a successful furrier, and Naschy grew up in very comfortable surroundings, at one point living in a veritable country mansion. Naschy went to college initially to become an architect. After college, he started out as a professional weightlifter, but soon gravitated to acting and filmmaking. His favorite film character from childhood was the Wolf Man, dating back to when he saw the classic Universal film \"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man\" (1943) as a child. At times, he tried his hand at designing record album covers, writing pulp western novels and drawing comic book stories, but did not meet with much success. In his 20s, Naschy moved back and forth between professional weightlifting and acting, but wasn't able to secure important roles, usually obtaining just bit parts.\n\nNaschy had an uncredited bit part in the classic 1961 Biblical epic \"King of Kings\" and a few other films of that period, and the experience drew him further into filmmaking. While appearing as an extra in an episode of the American TV show \"I Spy\" that was being filmed in a remote country site in Spain in 1966, Naschy met horror icon Boris Karloff on the set, a thrill he never forgot. (Karloff was in a very poor mood that day, apparently depressed and in poor health. This encounter led to a posthumously produced film biography on Naschy being entitled \"Paul Naschy: The Man Who Saw Frankenstein Cry\".)\n\nIn 1968, at age 34, he wrote a screenplay for a werewolf movie entitled \"The Mark of the Wolfman\" (about a Polish werewolf named Count Waldemar Daninsky) and managed to interest a Spanish film company called Maxper Producciones Cinematograficas into financing it. Naschy never intended to play \"El Hombre Lobo\" (as the doomed lycanthrope came to be called in Spain), he just wound up with the part when the producer could not find a suitable actor. (They had tried to hire Lon Chaney Jr., but at age 62, the fabled Hollywood horror star was far too sickly to travel).\n\nThe German distributors insisted he change his name from Jacinto Molina because it sounded too Spanish, which would have hurt the film's chances at the box offices in various countries outside of Spain. He created the name \"Paul Naschy\"... \"Paul\" after Pope Paul VI, and \"Naschy\" as a Germanic sounding version of \"Imre Nagy\", one of Naschy's weightlifting idols. Naschy later wrote and starred in eleven sequels featuring his Waldemar Daninsky werewolf character, and spun off a very successful acting and directing career in the process.\n\nNaschy wrote the screenplays for most of the films he starred in, especially the horror movies. His most prolific year was 1972, during which he wrote and starred in no less than seven movies. \n\nDuring the 1970s, he worked for some of the best Euro-horror film directors in the business, including León Klimovsky, Carlos Aured, Javier Aguirre, José Luis Madrid, Juan Piquer Simón, Francisco Lara Polop and José Luis Merino.\n\nIn 1976, he decided to try his hand at directing as well, choosing the costume drama \"Inquisición\" as his first project. He did well initially, even producing and directing a number of successful Japanese/Spanish co-productions and made-for-Spanish-TV documentaries, but by 1984, his films were no longer breaking even, and after losing a lot of money on his ill-conceived spy spoof \"Operation Mantis\" (1984), Naschy's production company, Aconito Films, wound up in bankruptcy. (Aconito is the scientific term for the herb wolfsbane).\n\nOn June 20, 1984, Naschy's father Enrique Molina died of a heart attack while fishing alone on the shores of a lake. Some boys playing in the woods discovered his body, too late to revive him. The unexpected sudden loss of his father (with whom he had always been very close), coinciding with the bankruptcy of his production company, plunged Naschy into a lengthy period of depression, only returning to filmmaking in 1987 with his cult classic \"El Aullido del Diablo\". Naschy's son Sergio starred in the film, along with famed horror icons Howard Vernon and Caroline Munro (the film was very poorly distributed unfortunately, and is still not available on DVD).\n\nNaschy's career took a second downturn when he suffered a near-fatal heart attack himself on August 27, 1991, triggered by weightlifting in a local gym. He was hospitalized for more than a week, then had major heart surgery performed on September 5. A rumor circulated throughout horror film fandom that Naschy had died, since he disappeared from the film scene for a while after his operation. He had to later contact a number of fanzine publishers in various countries to inform them that he was still very much alive.\n\nIn 1996, Naschy wrote and starred in his eleventh werewolf film \"Licántropo\", which he thought would be a big comeback film for him, but the movie did not do well at all, critically or financially. He continued to appear in a number of low budget horror films and crime dramas however during the following decade, during which time he won a number of prestigious fan awards and appeared as a celebrated guest at many horror film conventions during the 1990s and the 2000s (both in the United States and in Europe), although he was always doing poorly financially and complained bitterly in interviews about the state of the corrupt Spanish film industry. In 1997, Naschy wrote a detailed autobiography entitled \"Memoirs of a Wolf Man\" (which included his complete filmography as well).\n\nNaschy even traveled to Hollywood briefly in 2004 to appear in two filmed-on-video horror flicks directed by Donald F. Glut and Fred Olen Ray, two former horror fans-turned-directors who must have treated him like royalty on the set. During his sojourn in Hollywood, Naschy even visited the famed \"Ackermansion\" museum of Forrest J. Ackerman, the editor of the legendary \"Famous Monsters of Filmland\" magazine.\n\nPaul Naschy died of pancreatic cancer on November 30, 2009 at a hospital in Madrid, Spain at the age of 75. He struggled desperately to stay alive for over one year after being diagnosed with the cancer in 2008, but the end was inevitable. Although he ended his life in relatively poor financial straits, Naschy always received a tremendous outpouring of love from his many fans at the conventions he attended and died knowing he would always be regarded as a major horror film icon.\n\nNaschy was married only once, on October 24, 1969, to a woman named Elvira Primavera, the daughter of an Italian diplomat living in Spain. They were still happily married 40 years later at the time of his death. His wife was always very supportive of Naschy's film making projects and was undoubtedly one of the factors that led to his success. He was survived by his widow Elvira and his two sons, Bruno and Sergio Molina.\n\nNaschy's favorite director was León Klimovsky, with whom he made nine horror and action films. Naschy praised Klimovsky's professional workmanlike attitude, but he always felt that Klimovsky rushed through the filming and never allowed for enough retakes that might have improved some of their films. He also enjoyed working for director Carlos Aured, and was proud of the films they did together.\n\nPaul Naschy was the only horror film actor and director who ever portrayed Dracula, the Mummy, the Frankenstein's monster, Fu Manchu, the Hunchback, Rasputin, a warlock, a zombie, a medieval Inquisitor, a serial killer (not to mention a werewolf in 16 different films).\n\nA hardcover book entitled \"Muchas Gracias, Senor Lobo\" was published in Germany after Naschy's death, collecting hundreds of rare photos, lobby cards, posters, etc. that had been used to promote Naschy's films over the decades in a number of different countries. A comprehensive film biography entitled \"Paul Naschy: The Man Who Saw Frankenstein Cry\" (a reference to Naschy's meeting with Boris Karloff in 1966) has also been released on DVD.\n\nThe werewolf Count Waldemar Daninsky (known in Spain as \"El Hombre Lobo\") is without a doubt Paul Naschy's most famous horror character, since he played Daninsky in 12 different films. In fact, Naschy holds the record for playing a werewolf the most number of times, easily beating out Lon Chaney Jr., who played a werewolf only seven times during his career (counting \"La Casa del Terror\" and his appearance on \"Route 66\"). \nUnlike the Chaney Universal films, however, which formed a somewhat chronological storyline from picture to picture, Naschy's Daninsky films were not connected to each other plotwise. Each film was more or less a free-standing story that was not meant to relate to the other films in the series in the way the old Universal films did. Daninsky's lycanthropy had a different origin in each film (which many Naschy fans find confusing). This was probably for the best however, since in the 1970s, Euro-horror films were often theatrically distributed in the US several years after they were completed, and they probably would have all been released out of order anyway. \nNaschy's only other recurring character was the villainous medieval warlock \"Alaric de Marnac\" (who appeared in Naschy's \"Horror Rises from the Tomb\" (1972) and returned to life again in a sequel, \"Panic Beats\" (1982)). Naschy claims he based this character on a real-life medieval nobleman named Gilles de Rais, a serial killer on whose life story Naschy also based the lead character in his 1974 film \"El Mariscal del Infierno\" (\"The Devil's Possessed\")\n\nNaschy's twelve \"Hombre Lobo\" movies are not a series in the strictest sense. They seem to be a collection of unrelated plotlines, but all of which involve a werewolf named Count Waldemar Daninsky. Both \"La Furia del Hombre Lobo\" (1970) and \"La Maldicion de la Bestia\" (1975) refer to an origin involving Waldemar's being bitten by a yeti (and there is a brief yeti reference in \"La Noche de Walpurgis\" (1970) as well), but the other films presented him with entirely different origin stories. The fact that these films have also been retitled by the various film distributors many times over the years only adds to the confusion. Despite the numerous plot inconsistencies and convoluted flashbacks; however, Naschy's Wolf Man series as a whole is still considered his most famous work by most of his many fans.\n\nOnly eleven of the 12 \"Hombre Lobo\" films actually exist today. All traces of \"Las Noches del Hombre Lobo\" (1968) apparently vanished before the film was ever shown anywhere (not even Naschy has seen it), and it remains a mystery to this day whether or not the film ever really existed at all in completed form. Naschy said in interviews that he specifically remembered going to Paris for a week to shoot his scenes for the film, but he went right back to Spain after completing his scenes and never saw any rushes. The French producer of the film, Rene Govar (who apparently only directed this one film), is said to have died in a car accident in Paris a week after the filming was completed, and no one ever picked up the lab bill that was outstanding. Hence it is thought that the lab may have confiscated the film negative and years later they probably just discarded it. Naschy claimed he only became aware decades later that the film had never been released anywhere. Some Naschy fans think the film was scrapped in 1968 and the script may have been later rewritten to become the 4th film in the series, \"La Furia del Hombre Lobo\" (1970). This is possible since Naschy himself vaguely remembered both films as having virtually the same plot.\nIn order of production, the \"Hombre Lobo\" films are as follows:\nThere were four other Paul Naschy werewolf films that were not part of the Waldemar Daninsky series, as follows:\n\nPaul Naschy starred in many other horror films that did not feature el Hombre Lobo, as well as a number of crime films, costume dramas, action thrillers, etc. Below is a comprehensive list of all his movies, in strict chronological order of production. Dates shown are when the films were made, not when they were theatrically released in various foreign markets. This information was taken from Naschy's own autobiography (\"Memoirs of a Wolfman\") and the release date information is much more accurate than that found on any other websites.\n\nNote - Naschy allegedly played uncredited bit parts in the following films: \"King of Kings\" (1960, playing a servant to Pontius Pilate); \"El Principe Encadenado\" / \"The Chained Prince\" (1960, a.k.a. \"King of the Vikings\", playing a Mongol chieftain); \"Operation Plus Ultra\" (1966, playing a masked surgeon); \"Las Viudas\" / \"The Widows\" (1966, acting as assistant director in the \"Luna de Miel\" segment only); and \"La Esclava del Paraiso\" / \"Slave of Paradise\" (1968, a.k.a. \"1001 Nights\", playing a palace servant named Chantal). In most of these films, if you blinked, you'd miss him. Naschy allegedly acted as an assistant to the director on two other films, \"Aventura en el Palacio Viejo\" (1967) and \"Cronica de Nueve Meses\" (1967).\n\nNaschy died on November 30, 2009 in Madrid, Spain.\n\n\n\n"}

He is married to Penny Williams, who is also involved with the games industry. He was the co-creator of \"Dungeons & Dragons\" 3rd Edition and the longtime author of the \"Sage Advice\" column for \"Dragon Magazine\".\n\nBorn in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, Williams was informally acquainted with many of the people who developed and influenced the original \"Dungeons & Dragons\" game, going to school with Gary Gygax's son Ernie and participating in a gaming group that Gary used to playtest some of the \"AD&D\" rules. Williams started out working as a part-time clerk in TSR's Dungeon Hobby Shop in 1976. Williams first worked for TSR in an administrative capacity, working as a cashier, in shipping, and doing various office tasks. Williams directed the Gen Con game fair from 1980-1983. Williams was laid off after a time but continued to work for TSR in a freelance role, performing odd jobs; it was in this circumstance in 1987 that he came to write \"Sage Advice\" in the pages of \"Dragon\" - Williams recalls that \"Dragon\" editor Roger E.

He was also friends with Calamity Jane.\n\nUtter was born in 1842 near Niagara Falls, New York and grew up in Illinois, then traveled west in search of his fortune, becoming a trapper, guide, and prospector in Colorado in the 1860s. He met & married 15 year old Matilda \"Tily\" Nash on September 30, 1866 in her parents home in Empire, Clear Creek, Colorado Territory. Their marriage record lists Empire as his place of residence at the time of their marriage and by the 1870 Federal Census shows they had settled in nearby Georgetown, Colorado Territory.\n\nIn early 1876, Utter and his brother Steve took a 30-wagon train of prospectors, gamblers, prostitutes, and assorted hopefuls from Georgetown, Colorado, to the burgeoning town of Deadwood in the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory, where the recent discovery of gold had sparked a gold rush. Like many wagon trains, the wagons were Schuttler wagons which were notable for \"gaudy paint jobs\". In Cheyenne, Wyoming, famed gunman \"Wild Bill\" Hickok became partners with Utter in the train; Calamity Jane joined in Fort Laramie. The wagon train arrived in Deadwood in July 1876, and Utter began a lucrative pony express delivery service to Cheyenne, charging 25 cents to deliver a letter and often carrying as many as 2,000 letters per 48-hour trip.\n\nUtter had been a close friend of Hickok's for some time previously, constantly watching to ensure that Hickok's weaknesses of alcohol and gambling would not bring Hickok to a bad end. Unfortunately, Utter was not present on August 2, 1876, when Jack McCall fatally shot Hickok in the back of the head as Hickok played poker in a Deadwood saloon. Utter later claimed the body and placed a notice in the local newspaper, the \"Black Hills Pioneer\", which read:\n\nAttendance at the funeral was heavy, and Utter had Hickok buried with a wooden grave marker which read:\n\nUtter left for Colorado but returned in 1879 to have Hickok re-interred, at Calamity Jane's urging, in a ten-foot-square plot at the Mount Moriah Cemetery, surrounded by a cast iron fence and with an American flag in the ground.\n\nIn February 1879, Utter purchased the Eaves Saloon in Gayville, South Dakota but ran into a string of bad luck. He was found guilty of selling liquor without a license, then of maintaining a nuisance dance hall in the nearby town of Lead. He returned to Deadwood in time for the September 26, 1879 fire which devastated Deadwood, destroying more than three hundred buildings and consuming the belongings of many inhabitants.\n\nFollowing the destructive fire, Deadwood ceased to be a frontier town where fortunes could be built (or rebuilt) from nothing, and the newly impoverished left to try their luck in other gold rushes. Utter followed, first to Leadville, Colorado in February 1880; then Durango, Colorado showing separated or divorced from his wife ; then Socorro, New Mexico, where he opened a saloon and was reported to have a relationship with faro dealer Minnie Fowler. Utter's biographer, Agnes Wright Spring, traced him to Panama in the early 1900s. Now losing his eyesight, he owned drugstores in Panama City and Colón. \nAccording to ship manifests, Utter made several trips back and forth between the United States and Panama in 1888, 1891, 1905, 1910, 1912 each listing his occupation as a \"druggist\".\n\nUtter cut a notable figure; he was 5'6\" (167.64 cm), and was reported as being extremely meticulous in his appearance, highly unusual for that place and time. He had long, flowing black hair and a mustache, perfectly groomed, wore hand-tailored fringed buckskins, fine linen shirts, beaded moccasins, and a large silver belt buckle, and carried a pair of gold, silver, and pearl ornamented pistols. He would allow nobody into his tent, even Hickok, on pain of being shot; in his tent he slept under the highest quality blankets, imported from California, and carried with him mirrors, combs, razors, and whisk brooms. Most unusual of all, he was well known for his \"bizarre habit\" of bathing daily. \n\nUtter is portrayed by Dayton Callie in the HBO television series \"Deadwood\" and \"\". Contrary to the meticulous historical Utter, the character is portrayed as rough-mannered and often unkempt in his appearance. The film, set in 1889, shows the character still living in Deadwood, although the historical Charlie Utter had moved back to Colorado in 1880. The film also shows Utter being murdered in 1889 by henchmen sent by George Hearst, after Utter refused to sell his land to Hearst. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1813828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1813828", "title": "Design patent", "text": "Design patent\n\nIn the United States, a design patent is a form of legal protection granted to the ornamental design of a functional item. Design patents are a type of industrial design right. Ornamental designs of jewelry, furniture, beverage containers (Fig. 1) and computer icons are examples of objects that are covered by design patents.\n\nA similar concept, a registered design, can be obtained in other countries. In Kenya, Japan, South Korea and Hungary, industrial designs are registered after performing an official novelty search. In the countries of the European Community, one needs to only pay an official fee and meet other formal requirements for registration (e.g. Community design at EUIPO, Germany, France, Spain).\n\nFor the member states of WIPO, cover is afforded by registration at WIPO and examination by the designated member states in accordance with the Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement.\n\nA US design patent covers the ornamental design for an object having practical utility. An object with a design that is substantially similar to the design claimed in a design patent cannot be made, used, copied or imported into the United States without the permission of the patent holder. The copy does not have to be exact for the patent to be infringed. It only has to be substantially similar. Design patents with line drawings cover only the features shown as solid lines. Items shown as dotted lines are not covered. This is one of the reasons Apple was awarded a jury verdict in the US case of \"Apple v. Samsung\". Apple's patent showed much of their iPhone design as broken lines. It didn't matter if Samsung was different in those areas. The fact that the solid lines of the patent were the same as Samsung's design meant that Samsung infringed the Apple design patent.\n\nDesign patents are subject to both the novelty and non-obviousness standards of the patent code. However, because design patents are not measured based on the utility of the designs to which they are directed, there is an open question as to how to measure the non-obviousness of an ornamental design.\n\nBoth novel fonts and computer icons can be covered by design patents. Icons are only covered, however, when they are displayed on a computer screen, thus making them part of an article of manufacture with practical utility. Screen layouts can also be protected with design patents.\n\nIn China, Canada, Japan, South Africa, and the United States, a design patent application is not published and is kept secret until granted.\n\nIn Brazil, the applicant can request that the application be kept in secrecy for a period of 180 days from the filing date. This will also delay the prosecution and granting of the application for 180 days.\n\nIn Japan, an applicant can request that a design be kept secret for a period of up 3 years after the registration has been granted.\n\n\nUS utility patents protect the functionality of a given item. Providing the maintenance fees are paid, utility patents are generally valid for up to 20 years from the date of filing (with some exceptions).\n\nDesign patents cover the ornamental nonfunctional design of an item. Design patents can be invalidated if the design has practical utility (e.g. the shape of a gear). Design patents are valid for 14 years from the date of issue if filed prior to May 13, 2015, or 15 years from the date of issue if filed on or after May 13, 2015. There are no maintenance fees.\n\n\"In general terms, a “utility patent” protects the way an article is used and works (35 U.S.C. 101), while a “design patent” protects the way an article looks (35 U.S.C. 171). The ornamental appearance for an article includes its shape/configuration or surface ornamentation applied to the article, or both. Both design and utility patents may be obtained on an article if invention resides both in its utility and ornamental appearance.\"MPEP - Distinction Between Design and Utility Patents\n\nCopyright prevents nonfunctional items from being copied. To show copyright infringement, the plaintiff must show the infringing item was copied from the original. The copyrighted artistic expression must either have no substantial practical utility (e.g. a statue) or be separable from the useful substrate (e.g. picture on a coffee mug).\n\nDesign patents, on the other hand, cover the ornamental aspects of functional items from being infringed. One does not have to show that the infringing item was copied from the original. Thus a design that was arrived at independently can still infringe a design patent. This is fax.\n\nMany objects can be covered by both copyright and design patents. The Statue of Liberty is one such example.\n\nTrademarks and trade dress are used to protect consumers from confusion as to the source of a manufactured object. To get trademark protection, the trademark owner must show that the mark is not likely to be confused with other trademarks for items in the same general class. The trademarks can last indefinitely as long as they are used in commerce.\n\nDesign patents are only granted if the design is novel and not obvious for all items, even those of different utility than the patented object. An actual shield of a given shape, for example, can be cited as prior art against a design patent on a computer icon with a shield shape. The validity of design patents is not affected by whether or not the design is commercialized.\n\nItems can be covered by both trademarks and design patents. The contour bottle of Coca-Cola, for example, was covered by a now expired design patent, , but is still however protected by at least a US registered trademark.\n\n\n"}

It is conferred upon individuals who have rendered exceptional and meritorious services to the Republic of the Philippines, upon diplomats, officials and nationals of foreign states who have rendered conspicuous services in fostering, developing and strengthening relations between their country and the Philippines, or upon personnel of the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), both in the Home Office and in the Foreign Service.\n\nThe Order of Sikatuna may be awarded by the Secretary of Foreign Affairs in the name and by authority of the President.\n\nThe Order of Sikatuna was established by President Elpidio Quirino as the \"Order of Sikatuna\" through Executive Order No. 571 dated February 27, 1953. Section 2 of the executive order states, \"The Order of Sikatuna [...] commemorates the first treaty (Pacto de Sangre) between the Philippines and a foreign country...\" In the Quirino order, the Order of Sikatuna commemorates the \"pacto de sangre\" or blood compact, more popularly known as sandugo. This was, according to the Executive Order, the first international treaty of friendship between Bohol native chieftain, Datu Sikatuna and Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi, between a Filipino and Spaniard. Lately, however, the Executive Order's premise has been put to question. The event was not the first blood compact since the first recorded happened 44 years before between Ferdinand Magellan, representing the Spanish crown, and \"raia\" Siaiu, king of the island-port of Mazaua. Magellan called the ceremony \"casi casi\", a Malayan term meaning \"to be one and the same thing\" or to be blood brothers. At the same time the first recorded Treaty of Peace was entered into on Tuesday, April 9, 1521 by datu Humabon of Cebu and Magellan.\n\nThe Order of Sikatuna's composition was expanded from the original four classes by Presidents Diosdado Macapagal and again by Ferdinand E. Marcos. In 2003, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo reformed the Philippine system of orders, medals, and decorations, through Executive Order No. 236, known as the Honors Code of the Philippines which codified the civilian orders, decorations and medals of the Republic of the Philippines. Among its provisions was one renaming the order as simply, \"The Order of Sikatuna,\" and clarifying its protocolar standing.\n\n\n\n\n\"This article incorporates public domain text from the library of the Philippine Congress.\"\n\n\n"}

It links the City of Gatineau and Canada's National Capital Region to the Greater Montreal area. It is nicknamed by many the “Highway of Death” due to the numerous lethal head on collisions.\n\nUntil November 2012, there were two distinct sections of A-50: one section running eastward from Hull and the other westward from Mirabel. The gap in the highway was filled on November 26, 2012, and the two-lane freeway opened for traffic on the full length.\n\nThe route provides a freeway alternative to Route 148 that does not require crossing into Ontario, unlike the main Trans-Canada Highway route (A-40 / Hwy 417) from metropolitan Montreal.\n\nOswald Parent (a Liberal MP from Hull) originally proposed construction of the A-50 in 1962. Eight years later, Quebec Premier Jean-Jacques Bertrand announced plans for construction. It was originally envisioned that the A-50 would extend over 400 km from L'Isle-aux-Allumettes at the Ontario border through Saint-Jérôme and Joliette along the Route 148 and 158 corridors to Berthierville and a junction with the A-40. The primary purpose of the A-50 was to connect Ottawa and the Outaouais with Montréal–Mirabel International Airport.\n\nAt the time, the Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport was not yet built, and the national capital lacked highway access to an international air hub. Mirabel's rapid decline as an air hub as well as the Quebec government's decision in the 1970s to impose a moratorium on new autoroute construction resulted in a significantly truncated route for the A-50. Plans for extending the A-50 west of Hull and east of the A-15/TCH were abandoned. The exit numbers, however, are based on that original projected length of the autoroute.\n\nConstruction was completed in the fall of 2007 on the road that connects Highway 148 west of the Aylmer and Hull sectors to the A-50 at the Boulevard des Allumettières interchange.\n\nOne short section of Route 158 around Joliette was originally signed as A-50 as well until the project was abandoned. In addition, west of the current terminus, a four-lane at-grade expressway continues as Route 148 into the Aylmer section of Gatineau; it may become part of A-50 in the future.\n\nA-50 is a four- to six-lane freeway through Gatineau up to Buckingham, the remainder is mostly a two-lane freeway. Many overpasses are built to accommodate a fully divided, four-lane highway in the future such that only one portion of the overpass is currently used. However, there have been demands for a four-lane highway for the new segment so it can be safer. The first two segments were built with only two lanes and a 2007 multi-fatality accident occurred on highway 148 near Buckingham, a section of highway that A-50 would bypass.\n\nUnusual for a limited-access highway, the A-50 contains two railway crossings at grade, both of the Quebec Gatineau Railway (QGRY). The first crosses the QGRY Lachute Subdivision between exits 260 and 272, at , while the second crosses the QGRY St-Jerome Spur about 1 km west of exit 279, at .\n\nThere has been some support to rename the highway \"Autoroute Maurice-Richard\" after historic Montreal Canadiens hockey player Maurice Richard, but the Commission de toponymie du Québec chose to wait until the section between Buckingham and Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours was finished before making a decision, and to date no renaming has happened.\n\nFollowing a series of fatal collisions in 2007, it was announced that centreline rumble strips would be installed in various no-passing zones along Autoroute 50. This is the first installation of its kind in Quebec and serves as a pilot project.\n\nThe two at-grade intersections at km 281 and 283 were removed in 2016.\n\nNote: exit numbers in parentheses are unsigned.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1813838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1813838", "title": "White point", "text": "White point\n\nA white point (often referred to as reference white or target white in technical documents) is a set of tristimulus values or chromaticity coordinates that serve to define the color \"white\" in image capture, encoding, or reproduction. Depending on the application, different definitions of white are needed to give acceptable results. For example, photographs taken indoors may be lit by incandescent lights, which are relatively orange compared to daylight. Defining \"white\" as daylight will give unacceptable results when attempting to color-correct a photograph taken with incandescent lighting.\n\nAn illuminant is characterized by its relative spectral power distribution (SPD). The white point of an illuminant is the chromaticity of a white object under the illuminant, and can be specified by chromaticity coordinates, such as the \"x\", \"y\" coordinates on the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram (hence the use of the relative SPD and not the absolute SPD, because the white point is only related to color and unaffected by intensity).\n\nIlluminant and white point are separate concepts. For a given illuminant, its white point is uniquely defined. A given white point, on the other hand, generally does not uniquely correspond to only one illuminant. From the commonly used CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram, it can be seen that almost all non-spectral colors (all except those on the line of purples), including colors described as white, can be produced by \"infinitely many\" combinations of spectral colors, and therefore by infinitely many different illuminant spectra.\n\nAlthough there is generally no one-to-one correspondence between illuminants and white points, in the case of the CIE D-series standard illuminants, the spectral power distributions are mathematically derivable from the chromaticity coordinates of the corresponding white points.\n\nKnowing the illuminant's spectral power distribution, the reflectance spectrum of the specified white object (often taken as unity), and the numerical definition of the observer allows the coordinates of the white point in any color space to be defined. For example, one of the simplest illuminants is the \"E\" or \"Equal Energy\" spectrum. Its spectral power distribution is flat, giving the same power per unit wavelength at any wavelength. In terms of both the 1931 and 1964 CIE XYZ color spaces, its color coordinates are [\"k\", \"k\", \"k\"], where \"k\" is a constant, and its chromaticity coordinates are [\"x\", \"y\"] = [⅓, ⅓].\n\nIf the color of an object is recorded under one illuminant, then it is possible to estimate the color of that object under another illuminant, given only the white points of the two illuminants. If the image is \"uncalibrated\" (the illuminant's white point unknown), the white point has to be estimated. However, if one merely wants to white balance (make neutral objects appear neutral in the recording), this may not be necessary.\n\nExpressing color as tristimulus coordinates in the LMS color space, one can \"translate\" the object's color according to the Von Kries transform simply by scaling the LMS coordinates by the ratio of the maximum of the tristimulus values at both white points. This provides a simple, but rough estimate. Another method that is sometimes preferred uses a Bradford transform or another chromatic adaptation transform; in general, these work by transforming into an intermediate space, scaling the amounts of the primaries in that space, and converting back by the inverse transform.\n\nTo truly calculate the color of an object under another illuminant, not merely how it will be perceived, it is necessary to record multi-spectral or hyper-spectral color information.\n"}

There is no evidence that this or other \"anti-cancer\" diets are effective, and the Budwig diet may be actively harmful.\n\nWhile working as a researcher at the German Federal Health Office she noted many cancer drugs being evaluated in the 1950s contained sulphydryl groups. Budwig believed sulphydryl compounds were important to cellular metabolism and cellular respiration. Budwig researched the theory that a low oxygen environment would develop in the absence of sulphydryl groups and/or fatty acid partners that would encourage the proliferation of cancerous cells. With H.P. Kaufmann she developed paper chromatography techniques to identify and quantify fatty acids. Budwig used these techniques to compare the fatty acid profiles of sick and healthy individuals. This made her one of the first scientists to consider the health implications of fat consumption, according to Mannion et al. in a 2010 paper in the journal \"Nutrients\".\n\nIn 1952 she described a diet which she claimed had anti-cancer effects.

It is a zwitterion formed by the methylation of the nitrogen atom of niacin (vitamin B). Trigonelline is a product of niacin metabolism that is excreted in urine of mammals.\n\nTrigonelline occurs in many plants. It has been isolated from the Japanese radish (\"Raphanus sativus\" cv. Sakurajima Daikon), fenugreek seeds (\"Trigonella foenum-graecum\", hence the name), garden peas, hemp seed, oats, potatoes, \"Stachys\" species, dahlia, \"Strophanthus\" species, and \"Dichapetalum cymosum\". Trigonelline is also found in coffee. Higher levels of trigonelline is found in arabica coffee.\n\nHoltz, Kutscher, and Theilmann have recorded its presence in a number of animals.\n\nTrigonelline crystallizes as a monohydrate from alcohol in hygroscopic prisms (m.p. 130 °C or 218 °C [\"dry, dec.\"]). It is readily soluble in water or warm alcohol, less so in cold alcohol, and slightly so in chloroform or ether. The salts crystallize well, the monohydrochloride, in leaflets, sparingly soluble in dry alcohol. The picrate forms shining prisms (m.p. 198−200 °C) soluble in water but sparingly soluble in dry alcohol or ether. The alkaloid forms several aurichlorides: the normal salt, B•HCl•AuCl, is precipitated when excess of gold chloride is added to the hydrochloride, and, after crystallization from dilute hydrochloric acid containing some gold chloride, has m.p. 198 °C. Crystallized from water or very dilute hydrochloric acid, slender needles of B•3 HAuCl (m.p. 186 °C) are obtained.\n\nWhen trigonelline is heated in closed tubes with barium hydroxide at 120 °C, it gives rise to methylamine, and, if treated similarly with hydrochloric acid at 260 °C creates chloromethane and nicotinic acid (a form of vitamin B). Trigonelline is a methyl betaine of nicotinic acid.\n"}

{"id": "1813886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1813886", "title": "Rotary Youth Exchange", "text": "Rotary Youth Exchange\n\nRotary Youth Exchange (RYE) is a Rotary International student exchange program for students in secondary school. Since 1929, Rotary International has sent young people around the globe to experience new cultures. Currently, about 9,000 students are sponsored by Rotary clubs every year. Typically, students are sent to another country for a year-long stay, generally living with multiple host families during the year and being expected to perform daily tasks within the household as well as attend school in the host country. Short term exchange programs are also quite common. These typically involve direct student exchanges between two families arranged through Rotary to coincide with major school holiday periods.\n\nThe Rotary Club of Copenhagen, Denmark initiated the first Rotary exchange in 1927, and the Rotary Club of Nice, France followed suit soon after in 1929. Although exchanges today usually last ten months, the first exchanges took place during school vacations for only a couple of weeks. The year-long Rotary Youth Exchange program was created in 1958 in Lake Placid at a Rotary Governors assembly. Here, many rules and procedures were established that still exist today. The first year-long exchange conducted by Rotary under this new framework involved a student leaving from Scottsbluff, Nebraska to live in Myrtleford, Australia for 10 months, and two Australians from Myrtleford arriving in Grand Lake, Colorado. In the following years more and more countries became involved in the program. In 1962 the first involving Japan and Germany were arranged after tense relations between them and other Rotary International Clubs following World War II. Since its conception 80 years ago, the Rotary Youth Exchange program has expanded rapidly to exchange 9,000 students annually between 80 countries.\nThrough the Rotary Youth Exchange, Rotary International hopes to create a more interconnected and understanding world. One of Rotary's primary goals is promoting peace around the world, and through the Rotary Youth Exchange, it aims to make the world a more peaceful place one exchange at a time. This rationale follows the logic that if a students experience different cultures and meet people from all around the world, they will be more understanding of foreign people and countries in the future. Rotary expects that this understanding will lead to a more interconnected and peaceful world.\nThe Rotarians that participate in the program are volunteers. Many Rotarians are involved in various aspects of the youth exchange program including student selection, compliance with immigration and Rotary regulations, hosting, and supporting students. Each student is sponsored by a Rotary Club and Rotary District in their home country and is hosted by a Rotary Club and Rotary District in their host country. Most districts have a chair for the Rotary Youth Exchange program and some also have committees. Each Rotary Club that hosts a student SHOULD provide both a Rotarian youth exchange officer and a Rotarian counselor for the student. The counselor is the student's contact person within the club and provides support to the student when needed (this does not always happen). Some districts are very active and host and send many students, other districts are less active and host fewer students. Some clubs do not even invite host students to attend weekly meeting while other clubs will actively encourage the students to attend.\n\nThe parent Rotary organization, Rotary International, has instituted a Certification Program which assesses individual RYE programs with a primary focus on quality control and student safety. Rotary groups are not permitted to participate in RYE programs without first obtaining RI Certification.\n\nIn 2003, an Australian woman accused the volunteer charity, Rotary, of failing to investigate or adequately respond to her allegations of repeated abuse by a Rotarian who was supposed to be looking after her during her exchange in 1967 when she was 15.\n\nEvents for students vary from country to country and district to district, but exchange students may often be able to visit other parts of their host country and sometimes other countries while on exchange with their host families, schools, or Rotary. Many districts organize tours for the students they host, which may include weekend trips to nearby cities, tours of the host country that may last several weeks, and many students in Europe have the opportunity to take part in Eurotours which visit many countries and last two to four weeks. However, like most exchange programs, the primary purpose of Rotary Youth Exchange is to provide a cultural and academic exchange and significant independent travel by students is therefore not allowed.\n\nExchange students are called \"outbounds\" by their home (sponsor) Rotary club and district, and simultaneously \"inbounds\" by their host Rotary club and district in the country they spend their year in. Students who have completed their exchanges are called \"rebounds\". Rebounds can earn the title of \"Rotex\" in various ways depending on their host district. Some districts create requirements for rebounds to complete before becoming Rotex, while others simply allow all rebounds to become rotex. \"Rotex\" participate in the organization Rotex for helping exchangers. There is also the rare \"yo-yo\" - a student who has been on two exchanges. Other slang includes the terms \"newbies\" and \"oldies\". Due to the arrival of many of the southern hemisphere students in January and the northern hemisphere students in August, there is a group of students that are half a year behind or ahead of that current generation. A student from an older generation is an oldie and students from newer generation are newbies. This half year delay can be helpful in mentoring the newer students into an exchange student's lifestyle. Another slang word that is used is \"dinosaur\", which can refers to one's oldie's oldie. Other terms include \"Northie\" and \"Southie\", referring to student from either a northern or southern (respectively) hemisphere country, which affects the time period that an exchanger will spend in their host country. A Southie will usually depart either January or February, staying in their host country until the beginning of the next year, while a Northie usually leaves in August or September and stays until the following June or July. This is usually dependent on the students' home country. A student from the United States will almost always leave in August or September and will stay until June or July. This can result in back-to-back summers, if a student travels to the southern hemisphere.\n\nHigh school students from 15 to 19 years of age are eligible to apply to the Rotary Youth Exchange program. To apply, a student can get in contact with his/her local Rotary club through the Rotary International website. Students in North America can connect with Rotary Youth Exchange through the website studyabroadscholarships.org. The typical application cycle begins in the September of the year before exchange, and includes various stages of interviews and paperwork. The length and exactitudes of this process depend on which Rotary district the student is from and which Rotary district he or she will travel to. Some families choose to simply host an exchange student and not send a child on exchange. A family interested in hosting an exchange student can get started by contacting his/her local Rotary club.\nRotary is somewhat known for their use of the \"Four D's\" as a way to protect their students. While abroad, Rotary students cannot Drink, Drive, Date or do Drugs. Being caught doing any of these things is grounds to be sent home. On average about 300 students are sent home a year. Within some Rotary districts there is a fifth D to avoid, Disfigurement. This rule mainly covers tattoos and piercings, but also carries over to less permanent, but still frowned upon practices, such as shaving one's head or dying hair crazy colors. Students are also expected to follow the law of the country they will be living in abroad. \n\nOf the more than 200 countries affiliated in some way with Rotary International, 80 countries typically participate in the Youth Exchange every year. The countries that participate vary from year to year, but the core members of the program (most notably in North America, Europe, and Asia) are always involved. Even though over 80 countries participate in the program, students do not have the ability to choose any country out of the 80. The Rotary district in which a student lives has a great impact on the countries he/she can go to. Most Rotary districts allow a student to pick various countries of his/her choice from a list of 20 or 30 countries, and there is no guarantee that a student will be sent to one of his/her choices. Some Rotary districts, notably in Japan, will not give prospective students any say in their country selection process. Some exchange destinations have age limitations, so an 18 year old applicant may not be able to go to as many countries as a 17 year old applicant.\n\nOnce accepted into the program it is up to the student to get themselves equipped and ready to go abroad. The responsibilities of the student and their family includes: \n\nGetting your Passport - Students should apply for their passport as soon as they are accepted into the program, as the process may take several weeks. \n\nStudent Visa and guarantee forms - Students may be required to complete a visa application and, as part of the formal Youth Exchange\napplication, and they will be required to complete a guarantee form. Rotarians facilitate the guarantee form process.\n\nAirline Tickets - While in many Rotary districts, the sponsor club will help purchase the tickets, in some they do not. Students and their families need to be prepared to have to take this responsibility unto themselves. \n\nHealth Insurance - In many Rotary districts, Insurance is included within the exchange fee; However, when it is not, students still need to have travel health insurance before their departure date. \n\nImmunization documentation - Most students are required to have immunization documentation. Local health departments and consular\nofficials can help students determine the required or recommended immunizations for the countries they are traveling to. Students should check with Rotarians from their sponsor club to determine whether additional health documentation will be necessary in the host country.\n\nDental and Medical Examinations\" - Students may need to have a thorough pre-exchange medical and dental examination.The application\nincludes an examination form that must be completed by a health care provider.\n\nToday, many Rotary Exchange students can be recognized by their Rotary Youth Exchange blazer. While most countries recommend navy blue, the blazer may also be dark green, red, black, or maroon. The color of the blazer usually depends on which country or region the exchange student is from. One Rotary tradition is that students cover their blazers in pins and patches they have traded with other students or bought in places they have visited as evidence of their exchange.\n\nBlazer colors (for countries with more than one color, the main one is in bold, the other ones are used in some regions):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRotary Youth Exchange from Rotary International\nRotary International\n"}

According to tribal custom Willie can then claim Lola as his wife. According to the law, Deputy Sheriff Cooper (Robert Redford) is required to charge him with murder.\n\nWillie Boy and Lola are hunted for several days by a posse led by Cooper. Willie manages to repel the posse's advance when he ambushes them from the top of Ruby Mountain. He only tries to shoot their horses, but ends up accidentally killing a bounty hunter, resulting in another murder charge.\n\nDays later, as the posse closes in, Lola dies by a gunshot wound to the chest. It is left deliberately ambiguous whether Lola shot herself in order to slow down the posse's advance or whether Willie killed her to keep her out of the posse's hands. Cooper is inclined to believe the latter and then goes off ahead of the posse to bring in Willie dead or alive. As soon as Cooper catches up, he comes under fire from Willie, who is positioned at the top of Ruby Mountain. Cooper narrowly avoids being shot on several occasions.\n\nIn the film's climax, Cooper maneuvers behind Willie, who has donned a ghost shirt, and tells him he can turn around if he wants to, which he does. The two pause before Willie raises his rifle at Cooper, who beats him to the draw and shoots him. Fatally struck in the chest, Willie tumbles down the hillside. Cooper picks up Willie's gun and finds that it wasn't even loaded, making it apparent that Willie deliberately chose death over capture. Abashed, Cooper carries the slain outlaw the rest of the way down Ruby Mountain and delivers him to other Paiutes, who carry the corpse away and burn the remains.\n\nWhen confronted by the county sheriff, Cooper is told that the burning of Willie's body will ruin the people's chance to see Willie in the (now-dead) flesh, denying them the ability \"to see something\". Cooper retorts: \"Tell them we're all out of souvenirs\".\n\n\nSource material for the film is Harry W. Lawton's 1960 book, \"Tell Them Willie Boy is Here\".\n\nAs depicted in the movie, Willie Boy and Lola (her actual name was Carlota, though she was also called Isoleta and Lolita in various accounts) did run through the Morongo Valley. Carlota was found shot in the back in an area known as The Pipes in northwest Yucca Valley. She was either killed by Willie Boy or shot accidentally by a posse member. Willie Boy did ambush the posse at Ruby Mountain, killing several horses and accidentally wounding a posse member. He ended his 'last stand' by suicide on the flanks of Ruby Mountain west of the current site of Landers, California.\n\nWillie Boy's grave monument can be found at . The monument itself bears the inscription “The West’s Last Famous Manhunt”, alluding to the notion that this was the last effort of its type before the use of a posse was generally replaced by modern, 'fully' staffed and empowered law enforcement agencies.\n\n\n\n"}

It is unrelated to the contemporary Skyline Conference that is active in NCAA Division III in the New York City area.\n\nThe conference began operating in 1938 with college athletic programs that left the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference. The seven charter members of the conference were: BYU, Colorado, Colorado A&M (now Colorado State), Denver, Utah, Utah State, and Wyoming.

{"id": "1813917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1813917", "title": "UBASIC", "text": "UBASIC\n\nUBASIC is a freeware (public domain software without source code) BASIC interpreter written by Yuji Kida at Rikkyo University in Japan, specialized for mathematical computing.\n\nUBASIC is a ready-to-run language that does not need to be set up with another advanced language, which is a common problem with multi-digit math languages. It runs in DOS or in a DOS box under DOS shell, Microsoft Windows, etc. It is specialized for number theory, primality testing, factoring, and large integers (up to 2600 digits). Being an implementation of BASIC makes it easy to read programs without having to do extensive study, as BASIC is a language that has a structure and syntax close to ordinary algebra. The help files have articles and lessons for beginners.\n\nUBASIC has a built-in on-line editor with several aids for debugging. It can show cross references to calling lines, lines containing a variable, and lists of variables/arrays. It can renumber lines, change variable names, and append additional programs. It can trace, single step, and time by milliseconds to help determine the fastest way to do highly repetitive sections. It can redefine function keys, either to provide an easy one-keypress function or to prevent a standard function from being accidentally used when it shouldn't. It can shell to DOS or execute a DOS command. It can convert between single-byte character set and double-byte character set, but to have much use for this, the host computer would likely need an aware operating system. Documents may be added to or modified in UBHELP.HLP.\n\nPrimality testing with APRT-CLE (to 884 digits) (it is best to run this under UBASIC version 8.8F or later): 500 digits said to take 5 hours on a PP-200, 150 digits takes about 16 minutes on a 486-100, about 2¼ minutes on a K6@233; 250 digits takes about 13½ minutes on a K6@233. Recent machines can be up to 10 times faster. APRT-CLE is often the algorithm of choice for testing primality of integers within its range.\n\nFactoring with programs such as ECMX is quite fast. It can find factors with the number of digits in the low-20s fairly easily, mid-20s somewhat less easily, and upper-20s with lower chance of success. It has found a 30-digit factor. (Finding factors with the elliptic curve method is always chancy for larger factors. The greater the number of curves that are tested the greater the chances of success, but the number needed (on average, one can sometimes get lucky or unlucky) increases rapidly with the size of factors. It is always best to use the fastest machine available. ECMX uses the accepted standards for limits of when to stop working with one curve and switch to the next. It has preliminary primality testing, finding small factors, and powers.\n\nBeing interpreted allows modifying programs and then restarting (using GOTO) in the middle of a run, even multi-day, without losing accumulated data. Stopping is not recommended unless a program has been saving the data safely somewhere, or if users forgot to write any way to save data when quitting (perhaps they did not expect to find any and were trying to prove it). When doing anything that might lose valuable data, or if you need to do something else for a time, then you can FREEZE the current program to a file and later MELT it (as long as the lower memory configuration is the same).\n\nUBASIC has line numbers. It does not use indentation to control structure. It has subroutines and user functions with passed parameters and local variables. Parameters can be passed by value or by name. User functions and subroutines may be passed as parameters. It has limited labels. It has various options for conditional functions. Users can indent as much as needed or not at all, and can have as much structure as wanted or spaghetti code. It is a mistake to consider UBASIC as \"not modern\" (as might be inferred by a reader of articles that confuse indentation with structure and don't favor line numbers). Having line numbers allows easy jumping to an intermediate point in a routine, which can sometimes save duplicating lines.\n\nUBASIC version 8 has the high-precision real and complex arithmetic (up to 2600 digits) of prior versions, and adds exact rational arithmetic and arithmetic of single-variable polynomials with complex, rational, or modulo p coefficients, as well as string handling and limited list handling abilities. In also has context-sensitive on-line documentation (read UBHELP.DOC for information). The file that this uses is ASCII and can be printed for a paper document.\n\nAs of 2005, the help file had many errors. A ten-year project to rewrite/correct was nearly ready for publication probably by late summer 2005. The new help file has a new extension '.hlp', and eventually package name u3d748f*. A list of updates is available, but many changes remain unreported.\n\nVersion 8.8 has different precision than 8.74\n\nThere are still some commands that have no documentation:\n\nThere is a new command from version 8.8C POLYCONV( that converts polynomials between modulus=0 and modulus=prime. There are no formatting specifications.\n\nWARNING: Never test out any of these when while anything important is (or might be) running or suspended somewhere else, as lockups may be expected, particularly for KEYSCAN.\nSee: FREEZE, ROLL, MELT. (for similar warning)\n\nUBASIC has several types of arrays, logical operators, bit operators, 4 standard loop structures, and combined operators. It can call machine language routines for increased speed (ECMX does this), but you must know assembly language to even understand the instructions - just being able to write TSR's in DEBUG is not enough.\n\n\nUBASIC can be used to process almost any kind of data. For example: .WAV files.\nIt can process text files to convert tabs to spaces or spaces to tabs. Some programs can not generate tabs and some actually choke on them.\n\nAn early 2005 Internet search turned up versions 8.74(32), 8.74(16), 8.71(4000(16)), 9.0ZE, \"9.0ZC, 9.0E,\" 8.8F(32), 8.8F(16), 8.8F(C), \"8.7E(32), 8.7E(16), 8.30(32), 8.30(16), 7.25(32), 7.25(16), 8.8A(32), 8,8A(16), 8.8A(C), 8.8C(32), 8.8C(16), 8.8C(C), 8.8E(32), 8.8E(16), 8.8E(C)\". 12 versions out of 52 known numbers. Many of these are not directly identified. (The (16) and (32) refer to the number of bits in the multiplication engine. (4000) refers to special versions that can go up to over 4000 digits (some users may need one of these, such as to generate the first 792 Bernoulli numbers to double index 1584: the latest version can only get 540/1080). The (C) is for CGA machines. The versions in italics are not recommended.)\n\n\"Most users would only need 8.8F.\"\n\nIf you are already using a version later than 8.74 and especially if you are using a version later than 8.7E then you are strongly advised to switch to the latest version (8.8F). Some programs (fancy display, for example) written for 8.74 may not work in 8.8F without considerable rewriting. The latest versions do not strip carriage returns/line feeds from ASCII files, and programs such as UBH (even the one in 8.8F) need added lines to strip them. Any program written for one version should not be used in another version without checking.\n\nCertain programs such as NFS will only run on experimental version 9.**.\n\nThe ppmpx36e version of the multi-polynomial quadratic sieve needs 8.8F and Windows.\n\nSome versions of UBASIC came with a defective UBCONST7.DAT file. You should check yours against the one supplied in 8.8F. If it is not identical then you should switch.\n\nFor obtaining the latest version of UBASIC, see external links sections. Many internet math pages have the language/packages on their own sites.\n\nThe following is a short simple program for the partition count function. Although it doesn't have many of the fancier structures, it is a real program, not invented for this article. On a modern fast Athlon it should calculate the partition counts from p(0) to p(1000) in about ½ second. Contrast that to over ½ century the first time through. To save the result to a file, uncomment line 40 (remove leading apostrophe).\n\nWhen working with continued fractions, the number of terms is limited by the available accuracy and by the size of each term. An approximate formula is 2 decimal fraction digit accuracy for each (term times the base ten logarithm of the term). The only way to do such work safely is to do it twice, in parallel, with the initial input to one dithered in the final several digits (at least 1 word). Then when the two calculations do not give identical terms, stop at the previous term.\n\nUBASIC can calculate the partition function to over p(1330521). (In 8.74 up to p(1361911) and the 4000 digit versions should get many more.)\n\n\n\nEssential features consists of the following:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1813921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1813921", "title": "Lötschberg Base Tunnel", "text": "Lötschberg Base Tunnel\n\nThe Lötschberg Base Tunnel (LBT) is a railway base tunnel on the BLS AG's Lötschberg line cutting through the Bernese Alps of Switzerland some below the existing Lötschberg Tunnel. It runs between Frutigen, Berne, and Raron, Valais.\n\nThe Lötschberg Base Tunnel was built as one of the two centrepieces of the NRLA project (the New Railway Link through the Alps). Construction of the LBT commenced in 1999 and achieved breakthrough during 2005. A ceremony to mark its completion was held in June 2007; the first train operations began in December 2007. Within only a few years of opening, the LBT had become saturated because of a single-track section present; without the completion of the second bore, its overall capacity has been greatly reduced. During 2016, a planning contract was awarded for the completion of the second track of the LBT, which has been estimated to cost 1 billion Swiss francs. The resulting plan was presented in Spring 2019, and construction of the second tunnel is expected to start in 2021/2022 and to be completed by the end of 2028.\n\nThe LBT was principally constructed for the purpose of easing lorry traffic on the Swiss road network by providing faster routes for rail-based freight as an alternative. Reportedly, between the 1980s and 2000s, traffic on the north-south European axis had increased more than tenfold, necessitating infrastructure investments to better cope with rising demands. Accordingly, the LBT allows an substantial number of lorries and trailers to be loaded onto trains in Germany, pass through Switzerland on rail and be unloaded in Italy. It also cuts down travel time for German tourists going to Swiss ski resorts, and puts the Valais into commuting distance to Bern by reducing travel time by 50%. The total cost was SFr 4.3 billion (as of 2007, corrected to 1998 prices). This and the Gotthard Base Tunnel are the two centerpieces of the Swiss NRLA project.\n\nIn 1994, early drilling was conducted in the area. During 1999, full-scale construction work on the LBT commenced. It was largely excavated using a combination of traditional techniques, including drilling and blasting. Roughly 80 percent of the tunnel was built using these conventional practices. The remaining 20 percent was driven using tunnel boring machines (TBMs). The excavation work was conducted from both the north and south portals. During April 2005, the construction process reached a milestone when breakthrough was achieved; the event was attended by 1,000 guests. The excavation process reportedly used 16 tons of explosives, while the material extracted would have filled a freight train that was 2,500 miles in length. Work over the following year centered on the fitting-out process, installing all of the operational systems, including the track itself.\n\nIn July 2006, track construction in the LBT was declared complete. Extensive testing then took place, including more than 1,000 test runs, which focused among other things on the use of the ETCS Level 2 system. Once satisfied that all systems had been validated, an official opening ceremony for the LBT was held during June 2007; at this event, the tunnel was recognised as the longest land tunnel anywhere in the world. The LBT overran its budget of roughly $2.7 billion by around $840 million, which has impacted its operation.\n\nOn 9 December 2007, the LBT was declared operational. Initially, only regular freight services traversed the LBT, along with a minority of international and InterCity passenger trains (without stops between Spiez and Brig); passenger trains continued to operate on the old timetable (the travel time between Spiez and Brig was considered to be 56 minutes until December 2007, even if actual travel time through the LBT was only about 30 minutes). Since February 2008, the LBT has been routinely used for normal InterCity routes. Travel time between Visp and Spiez is about 28 minutes, of which 16 minutes is spent inside the LBT.\n\nAs a consequence of spiraling costs attributable to the overall NRLA project, it was decided to redirect funds from the Lötschberg tunnel to the Gotthard Base Tunnel. This funding decision left the LBT in a partially-completed state for a protracted period. Once fully complete, the LBT will consist of two single track bores side by side from portal to portal, connected about every with cross cuts, enabling the other tunnel to be used for escape.\n\nCurrently, from South to North, a third of the tunnel is double track, a third is single track with the second bore in place but not equipped, and a third is only a single track tunnel with the parallel exploration adit providing the emergency egress. This unused western bore has been used by maintenance crews as a means of accessing the active eastern tunnel; an adjacent exploratory bore driven during the early 1990s has also proved useful for such purposes.\n\nThe construction process was divided into three phases, of which only phase one has been completed to date:\n\nPhases two and three may be performed concurrently or separately. The cost of completing work on the LBT has been estimated to be around one billion Swiss francs. The project also includes two parallel bridges over the river Rhône in canton Valais, the Engstlige tunnel (built with cut-and-cover method; the two tracks are separated by a wall). During 2016, it was announced that a planning contract for phases two and three had been awarded to the Swiss engineering consortium IG Valbt, headed by SRP Ingenieur. During early 2019, the resulting plan was presented for review. At ehe time, construction was reportedly expected to start around 2021/2022 and was projected for completion by the end of 2028.\n\nAccording to its owner, BLS NETZ AG, the LBT is one of the safest, most modern and most technically complex rail tunnels in the world. The company has attributed the tunnel's congestion to be a product of both the rapid growth of passenger and freight traffic as well as the presence of a single track section, which severely limits its overall capacity; it views the implementation of double-track running as being \"absolutely essential\". Operation of the LBT allegedly has an impact on the timetable reliability and flexibility across the entire Swiss rail network, as well as facilitating a reduction in production costs via the freight traffic it carries.\n\nThe 21 km of single track present, which lack passing loops, has proven to greatly complicate operations. Despite its relatively recent completion date, the LTB has already reportedly become a major bottleneck for rail freight traversing the Alps. Typically, trains using the LTB are scheduled together in batches that run in each direction separated by long intervals; trains more than seven minutes late are either routed via the old line or must wait for the next available timetable slot in their direction in the LBT, incurring long further delays in either case. By 2019, around 110 trains per day were using the LBT, while a further 66 have continued to use the old mountain tunnel largely due to the base tunnel's current capacity constraints. Of these 110, 30 were passenger services and 80 were hauling various types of freight, including intermodal freight transport and long-distance heavy freight trains. Heavy freight trains up to a maximum weight of 4,000 tons and a maximum length of 1,500 metres have to use the LBT, as they are above the maximum gauge of the pre-existing mountain track. By 2017, the LBT reportedly facilitated the movement of 35.7 million gross tonne of rail freight.\n\nThe LBT is operated and monitored from a dedicated control centre based at nearby Spiez. The tunnel incorporates various measures for handling emergency situations; for use in such circumstances, a pair of intermediate access tunnels connect with the main bores at a series of underground emergency stations. Trains can also be moved between the two bores via multiple cross-over links spread throughout its length. Warm groundwater is continuously draining from the LBT; around 2010, measures were implemented to use this as an energy source for heating a nearby fishery operation.\n\nOn 13 March 2020, the second bore of the LBT was temporarily closed to all traffic following the discovery of ingress by both water and sand while remedial work was performed to address this. In addition to cleaning the tunnel interior, removing the sand and excess water via suction, and the flushing out of its drainage system, temporary steel tanks have been installed in the bore with regular inspections of the tunnel with a particular focus on this issue. Furthermore, solutions to prevent reoccurrence in the long term have been have been identified and are to be compiled into a plan for approval by the Federal Office for Transport during late 2020; if approved, sections of the LBT shall be modified accordingly. On 27 April 2020, it was announced that the LBT had been fully reopened.\n\n\nThe warmth of the water flowing out of the tunnel is used to heat the Tropenhaus Frutigen, a tropical greenhouse producing exotic fruit, sturgeon meat and caviar.\n\n\n"}

Established in 1941 on 10,747 acres (43.492 km²), it was the world's largest smokeless powder plant. Although owned by the U.S. government, the plant was operated by the Hercules Powder Company under a contract signed on May 11, 1942. Construction then began immediately and was followed by the first production of propellant 10 months later.\n\nDuring World War II, the Sunflower Ordnance Works produced more than 200 million pounds (91,000,000 kg) of propellants and employed as many as 12,067 people. Following the war, the plant was placed on partial standby. And in March 1947, the contract with Hercules Powder Company expired. When the plant was placed on complete standby in June 1948, the government took over maintenance and security.\n\nIn 1951, the Sunflower Ordnance Works was brought out of standby due to the Korean War. Once again, on June 30, 1952, the operation of the plant was contracted out to Hercules. This time the plant produced more than 166 million pounds (75,000,000 kg) of propellants, with employment of up to 5,374. The plant then went into standby again in June 1960.\n\nThe name of the plant was changed from the Sunflower Ordnance Works to Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant (SFAAP) on August 1, 1963. Two years later, on August 20, 1965, the plant was reactivated to aid the Vietnam War by producing in excess of 145 million pounds (66,000,000 kg) of propellants before ceasing operations in June 1971. While operating during this time, the plant employed up to 4,065 people. In 1972, the plant was returned to standby status.\n\nA major facility modernization program was started in August 1967. The program included the construction, between 1975 and 1979, of a facility for the production of nitroguanidine. This facility was the first of its kind in North America and began production in 1984 and continued until 1992, when the plant was again placed on standby. Nitroguanidine (NQ) is an essential component of triple-base gun propellant. In addition to being an oxidizer and energy carrier, it is loaded with hydrogen and this provides cooling in the gun tube which reduces the erosion rate of the tube metal so more rounds can be fired before refit. NQ was shipped out in fiberboard drums to another army facility where the triple-base is prepared,\n\nAlliant Techsystems won a contract on March 10, 1995 to market the use of the Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant facilities. Also in February 1995, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed that the site be placed on the National Priorities List, but it was never listed. Early in 1998, SFAAP was declared excess by the U.S. Army, and the General Services Administration began the process of selling the site. As of October 1, 2001, the Army changed to a maintenance contractor and reduced the number of buildings used to an office building, an environmental laboratory, the old guard headquarters as a records repository, and the guard shack at the main gate.\n\nThe Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant rail system was operated under contract by Hercules, Inc. The system included 59 miles of track, with rails ranging in size from 85 to 100 pounds (per yard) connecting with BNSF Railway, and the enginehouse was Building 501. Operations were conducted from Monday through Friday, 0800 to 1600 with a GE 80-ton locomotive numbered US Army 1662. Formerly assigned to Letterkenny Army Depot, PA, the locomotive went from Sunflower AAP to McAlester AAP, OK, where it was reported to being shipped to Senaca Army Depot, NY, in October 1999. When Seneca AD closed, the locomotive was sold to the Dominican Republic. All of the track at Sunflower AAP was pulled up following the plant's closure.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1813940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1813940", "title": "Synaptosome", "text": "Synaptosome\n\nA synaptosome is an isolated synaptic terminal from a neuron. Synaptosomes are obtained by mild homogenization of nervous tissue under isotonic conditions and subsequent fractionation using differential and density gradient centrifugation. Liquid shear detaches the nerve terminals from the axon and the plasma membrane surrounding the nerve terminal particle reseals. Synaptosomes are osmotically sensitive, contain numerous small clear synaptic vesicles, sometimes larger dense-core vesicles and frequently one or more small mitochondria. They carry the morphological features and most of the chemical properties of the original nerve terminal. Synaptosomes isolated from mammalian brain often retain a piece of the attached postsynaptic membrane, facing the active zone.\n\nSynaptosomes were first isolated in an attempt to identify the subcellular compartment corresponding to the fraction of so-called bound acetylcholine that remains when brain tissue is homogenized in iso-osmotic sucrose. Particles containing acetylcholine and its synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase were originally isolated by Hebb and Whittaker (1958) at the Agricultural Research Council, Institute of Animal Physiology, Babraham, Cambridge, UK. In a collaborative study with the electron microscopist George Gray from University College London, Victor P. Whittaker eventually showed that the acetylcholine-rich particles derived from guinea-pig cerebral cortex were synaptic vesicle-rich pinched-off nerve terminals. Whittaker coined the term synaptosome to describe these fractionation-derived particles and shortly thereafter synaptic vesicles could be isolated from lysed synaptosomes.\n\nSynaptosomes are commonly used to study synaptic transmission in the test tube because they contain the molecular machinery necessary for the uptake, storage, and release of neurotransmitters. In addition they have become a common tool for drug testing. They maintain a normal membrane potential, contain presynaptic receptors, translocate metabolites and ions, and when depolarized, release multiple neurotransmitters (including acetylcholine, amino acids, catecholamines, and peptides) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Synaptosomes isolated from the whole brain or certain brain regions are also useful models for studying structure-function relationships in synaptic vesicle release. Synaptosomes can also be isolated from tissues other than brain such as spinal cord, retina, myenteric plexus or the electric ray electric organ. Synaptosomes may be used to isolate postsynaptic densities or the presynaptic active zone with attached synaptic vesicles. Accordingly, various subproteomes of isolated synaptosomes, such as synaptic vesicles, synaptic membranes, or postsynaptic densities can now be studied by proteomic techniques, leading to a deeper understanding of the molecular machinery of brain neurotransmission and neuroplasticity.\n"}

It draws students from Concord as well as from the neighboring communities of Walnut Creek and Pleasant Hill. The school opened in 1962, and its first senior class graduated in 1964. Originally conceived as a temporary facility, the school currently carries an enrollment of over 1,500 total students for grades 9 through 12. When the nearby Northgate High School opened in 1974, YVHS lost approximately half its student body at the time. The school is part of the Mount Diablo Unified School District.\n\nSince 1964, one of the school's main athletic rivals has been the Clayton Valley High School Eagles. The main rival was the College Park Falcons, until the schools were redistricted to prevent ongoing vengeful stunts that were hindering good sportsmanship in the early 2000s. YVHS also shares a lesser rivalry (as well as a property line) with neighboring De La Salle High School.\n\nThe first varsity Warrior football game played at the YVHS campus in 38 years took place on September 16, 2006. Ground was broken on a new running track and all-weather turf football and soccer field at YVHS in August 2005. Prior to the completion of the new field, most football home games were played at Mount Diablo High School or Diablo Valley College, due to poor field conditions, condemned bleachers, and a lack of lighting.\n\nIn December 2005, the YVHS football team coached by Mike Ivankovich won the NCS-2A championship against Miramonte High School for the second time since 1999.\n\nIn the 2009-10 football season, the YVHS football team won the DVAL League championship for the first time. The league had been created two years prior. The team then advanced to the NCS playoffs, losing in the second round to Eureka High School.\n\nIn 2009, head football coach Joshua Davis resigned, and Chris Turner was named the new head coach. As of 2010, Chris Turner stepped down, and former defensive coordinator Todd Bauleke is now the head coach.\n\nIn 1992, YVHS changed its school colors to navy blue and gold. The student body felt that the previous colors of powder blue and yellow were no longer fashionable for athletic team uniforms.\n\nOn March 14, 1987, the YVHS boys' basketball team, coached by Jim Grace, won the Division 1 Northern California Championship at the Oakland Coliseum Arena, 56-54 (2OT) over James Logan High School. This marked the first time in history that an East Bay High School (east of the Caldecott tunnel) accomplished such a feat. The 1987 squad set and still holds the school record with 28 wins. The team was led by Eric Bamberger, Chris Roach and former NFL player for the Buffalo Bills and Minnesota Vikings Chris Walsh.\n\nOn February 29, 2020, the YVHS boys' soccer team won the North Coast Section Division 3 Championship for the second time in 5 years by a score of 3-2 over Albany High School. The team was lead to victory by Head Coach Cesar Chavez, Coach Bijan Sadeghy, Coach Rocky Gaglioti, and Team Captains Alejandro (Alex) Lopez (Sr.), Oliver King (Jr.), and Diego Ramos (Jr.). The game was played at Ygnacio Valley High School in front of a large number of supporters. After going 2-0 down early in the game, the Warriors fought back and were able to claim the title. Goals were scored by Alejandro (Alex) Lopez (Sr.), Yovani (Gio) Villa (Jr.), and Salvador (Chava) Quintero (Sr.).\n\nDuring the 1988 presidential campaign, then Vice President George Bush made an appearance at YVHS and addressed the student body. In 1996, YVHS received another presidential visit when Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore made a rare joint appearance. They visited the campus as part of the NetDay '96 event, which kicked off a drive to connect California public schools to the Internet.\nYVHS is an ideal location for such high-security visits, due to the limited entry points into school property.\n\nIn the early 1990s, YVHS also received visits from U.S. Representatives George Miller and Bill Baker, sponsored by the school's now-defunct Public Policy Society.\n\nThe school mascot, the Warrior, is represented as a Native American with a feathered headdress. Similar mascots representing Native American culture are often a point of contention throughout the state of California, where over 100 high schools have American Indian mascots.\n\nYVHS is occasionally cited in the ongoing school prayer debate, after allowing Muslim students to use an available room for prayer during Ramadan in 2004.\n\n\n"}

It was released on 23 November 2003 through DreamWorks Records. While the album did not match the success of her previous album in such markets as the United States and Australia, it did however become a success in several European countries. \"Folklore\" spawned five singles: \"Powerless (Say What You Want)\", \"Try\", \"Força\", \"Explode\" and \"The Grass Is Green\". The album has sold 2 million copies worldwide.\n\nThe album's title was influenced by Furtado's parents' immigration to Canada, \"When I look at my old photo albums, I see pictures of their brand-new house, their shiny new car, their first experiences going to very North American-type places like Kmart. When you have that in your blood, you never really part with it it becomes your own personal folklore.\" The album also displayed a diverse sound but with a more rock-oriented, acoustic approach. Furtado attributed the mellowness of the album to the fact that she was pregnant during most of its recording. \"Saturdays\" features vocals by Jarvis Church and \"Island of Wonder\" features vocals by Caetano Veloso.\n\n\"Folklore\" includes the single \"Força\" (meaning \"carry on\" or \"strength\" in Portuguese), which was written as the official anthem of the 2004 European Football Championship. Furtado performed the song at the championship's final in Lisbon, in July 2004. Other singles included the ballad \"Try\" and \"Powerless (Say What You Want)\", in which she embraces her Portuguese heritage; the song deals with \"the idea that you can still feel like a minority inside, even if you don't look like one on the outside\". Additional singles were released in certain territories; \"Explode\" in Canada and Europe, and \"The Grass Is Green\" in Germany.\n\nIt was announced on 11 November 2003 that Universal Music Group reached an agreement to acquire DreamWorks Records from DreamWorks SKG for \"about $100 million\". The purchase came at a time when the music business was \"going through major changes\" as it struggled to \"counter falling sales and the impact of unofficial online music sales\". Mo Ostin, the principal executive at DreamWorks Records, said: \"Despite the challenges of the music business today, Universal is acquiring a wonderful asset and the sale will assure the strongest possible future for our artists\". DreamWorks Records was folded into the Interscope Geffen A&M umbrella label in January 2004. Furtado's recording contract was then absorbed into Geffen Records.\n\n\"Folklore\" received mixed reviews from critics. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated that \"[w]hile there are some interesting musical moments on \"Folklore\" -- enough to make it worth a listen -- the dogged seriousness and didactic worldview become a bit overbearing not long before the album is a quarter of the way finished, particularly since the fusion of worldbeat and adult alternative pop often seems heavy-handed.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave a positive review stating that \"exultant music goes on its merry, multicultural way\". While \"Rolling Stone\" gave a negative review, calling \"Folklore\" \"slick, multicultural hodgepodge\" but \"without a single as good as 'I'm Like a Bird.'\" As she focused more on the songwriting, rather \"than on frenetically switching genres five times in one song\", BBC felt that it had \"twice the originality\" of her debut. \"The A.V. Club\" wrote that while \"few tracks on Folklore stand out, the album hangs together agreeably...\"\n\nThe album debuted at number eighteen on the Canadian Albums Chart with first-week sales of 10,400, and at number thirty-eight on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart, selling 68,000 in its first week. According to Nielsen SoundScan, it had sold 425,000 copies in the US by August 2008. It was not as successful as Furtado's debut album, \"Whoa, Nelly!\" (2000), partly because of troubles at DreamWorks Records and the less poppy sound. It lacked promotion because DreamWorks was sold to Universal Music Group at the time of \"Folkore\"'s release, and it spent only eleven weeks on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart. In 2005, DreamWorks Records was shut down and many of its artists, including Furtado, were absorbed into Geffen Records. Furtado noticed that the album was particularly successful in Germany, where it reached the top 5 on the albums chart, and said, \"Why do Germans love this album? I think I figured it out: It's so cerebral. It's great in its own way, but that's a different side.\"\n\nAll tracks produced by Nelly Furtado, Gerald Eaton and Brian West, except for \"The Grass Is Green\" which is produced by Furtado and Mike Elizondo and \"Island of Wonder\" which is produced by Furtado, Lil' Jaz, Eaton and West.\n\n\nCredits adapted from the \"Folklore\" liner notes.\n"}

{"id": "1813985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1813985", "title": "Korean sword", "text": "Korean sword\n\nKorean swords have served a central place in the defense of the nation for thousands of years. Although typical Korean land battles have taken place in wide valleys and narrow mountain passes, which favor use of the spear and bow, the sword found use as a secondary, close-quarters weapon, especially useful during sieges and ship-to-ship boarding actions. Higher quality, ceremonial swords were typically reserved for the officer corps as a symbol of authority with which to command the troops. Ceremonial swords are still granted to military officials by the civilian authority to this day.\n\nKorean swords typically fall into two broad categories, the \"Geom\", and the \"Do\". The Geom is a double edged weapon, while the Do is a single edged weapon; although exceptions exist. In common parlance, all swords may be referred to as \"Geom (Korean:검; 劍)\".\n\nThe history of the sword in the Korea begins with imports during Bronze Age in the mid 1st millennium BCE.\nNative production of Bronze and Iron swords appeared in the mid 1st millennium CE. Korea eventually developed a unique sword industry and a native tradition of Korean swordsmanship (Geom-do or Kum-do \"Way of the Sword\"), which reached its peak during the Joseon Dynasty\n(15th to 19th centuries). \nThis tradition was targeted for censure during the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910-1945), and many thousands of ancient swords were either stolen or destroyed.\nAfter Imperial Japan was defeated by the United States, and Korea was liberated, the sword culture began to recover. \n\nSince the late 20th century, there have been efforts towards reviving the lost arts of Korean sword-making and swordsmanship using examples carefully hidden away during the occupation, and swords recovered from abroad. The rarity of traditional Korean swords makes them extremely valuable, and in high demand for museums and collectors.\n\nThere is evidence of early imports of Chinese Bronze Age swords to the Korean peninsula.\nEvidence of sword production dates to the transitional Late Bronze to Early Iron Age (c. 1st century BC), with an \nearthenware mold for a Bronze Sword found in South Gyeongsang Province.\n\nThe earliest Korean sword type is the so-called Hwandudaedo or \"ring-pommel sword\", prevalent during the 1st to 6th centuries. Until the 3rd century, these sword were very rare and presumably reserved for royalty. They became more attainable in the later 4th and during the 5th century, and are found in many higher class tombs of this period. Their production declined in the 6th century.\n\nBy the last third of the Three Kingdoms period (i.e. 450 AD and beyond), steel making techniques had come from China (possibly during the Southern and Northern Dynasties period in China) and were also employed in Korean swordmaking by all three Korean kingdoms (Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla). In 2013, a Chinese Character inscription was discovered on a 5th-century sword from the Geumgwanchong tomb in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province.\nThe scabbard of the sword has the inscription 尒斯智王 \"Yisaji-wang\" (\"King Isaji\").\n\nLong swords during the Korean Three Kingdoms period were used primarily by cavalry and commanders (who were also usually mounted), not infantry. At this time land warfare consisted mostly of spearmen and bowmen on foot, mounted archers on horseback using two-handed bows, and mounted swordsmen with twin blades. Swords were not a primary weapon for all combat but were instead used mostly for shock attacks, defensive strokes, and for close-in fighting. Blades were heavy as they were made mostly of bronze and later iron, and pommels were often knobbed and used as balances or for very close-in work. Short swords may have been used in follow-up attacks, as short sword carriers were armoured completely.\n\nRecords indicate that the art of sword manufacturing, still in a rudimentary state, may have been transmitted to the Japanese Archipelago from the Korean Peninsula some time in the Three Kingdoms period, along with iron smelting and manufacture and later that of steel work; these methods and techniques, as well as their updates, continued to be transmitted during the North South States Period to the Japanese Archipelago until connections with the Asian mainland were largely closed off by Japan in the early part of the Heian period (794 AD to 1195 AD; the early part is considered to have ended in 967 AD).\n\nDuring the Goryeo dynasty, a limited number of Korean swords were exported for trade missions in Asia. It is likely that Korean swordmaking was influenced by the various influences present in Mongol and Chinese weapon manufacture after Goryeo's submission as a Mongol vassal after 6 Mongol invasions ending in 1259.\n\nThe Joseon period (15th to 19th centuries) is the \"classical\" era of Korean culture, including the creation of a national script and the suppression of Korean Buddhism in favour of Neo-Confucianism. Accompanying the neo-Confucian philosophies was an increased emphasis on the artistic, literary, and academic pursuits, while martial pursuits and training (while still understood to be necessary) declined in cultural stature.\n\nKorean swords were in production mostly for military and ceremonial use; private ownership outside of these purposes was largely restricted to members of the wealthy and/or politically influential classes, and possession by commoners often drew the suspicion of the authorities. Several types of ceremonial swords were made; among these sword types are the jingeom (dragon sword) and ingeom (tiger sword), which by tradition could be forged only at certain times. The highest grade of these, sa-ingeom (four tigers sword) and possibly the sa-jingeom (four dragons sword - none are extant) were reserved for the monarch and could only be made during a window of 2 hours every 12 years. The lower-grade swords - i-jingeom, sam-jingeom, i-ingeom, sam-ingeom (two dragons, three dragons, two tigers, three tigers) - could be made more frequently.\n\nAs only high-quality steel was considered for use in forging military swords, the quantity produced by Korean blacksmiths, even for Korea's own military, was limited (most Korean infantry used spears, tridents, and ranged weaponry such as the crossbow and composite bow, while swords were usually wielded by officers, local magistrates/deputies, and mounted soldiers). In addition, because Korean weapons manufacture was typically dedicated to the production of weapons for military/government use and under close scrutiny by government authorities, it was not uncommon for Koreans (both military personnel and civilians) to import swords, usually from Japan's renowned swordsmiths, in the event that Korean sources could not be secured.\n\nAmong the swords that were produced in Korea for use by its military and law enforcement officials include the jedok geom and bonguk geom (both of these refer to both a style of sword as well as a style of bladed combat). Blades were single edged and usually between 3–4 feet long; however, certain swords of the jedok geom style could reach a length of 6 feet (while it is unclear as to the style of the swords of Admiral Yi Sun-shin, he is believed to have wielded swords that were almost that size).\n\nThe \"saingeom\" is a type of Joseon-era sword from Western Korea. It has a 90 centimeter (35-inch) blade, produced primarily by molding rather than hammering.\n\nKorean swords are very scarce today, since most surviving examples were confiscated and destroyed during the colonial period. A systematic attempt was made to collect and destroy all Korean swords, coats of armour, and all Korean martial arts equipment. The entire history of Korean swords and armour was almost lost forever, along with much of Korea's culture and traditions, because of Japanese colonial policies.\n\nAfter the liberation of Korea in 1945, ceremonial swords were once again manufactured both in southern and northern Korea, and by the 1960s, sword-making was a vibrant and increasingly secure industry; however, due to the depredations and systematic destruction by the Japanese during the Japanese occupation of Korea, many traditions and techniques lost and were either completely unrecoverable or had yet to be recovered.\n\nMany different types of Do and Geom exist.\n\n\"Geom\" (검; 劍) is the Korean word for \"sword\"; it is typically used of double edged swords, but is also applied to single edged swords. \"Yedo\" (예도; 銳刀) is the specific term for a single-edged sword.\nThe Muyesinbo describes as bonguk geom or \"national sword\" a double-edged sword closely resembling the Eastern Han period \"jian\". This contrasted with the \"jedok geom\" or \"admiral sword\", the term for the type introduced in the 16th century by Li Rusong, usually about 5–6 feet tall and single edged. The sword was also straight and wielded with one or two hands.\n\nElements of the Korean sword include: \"geomjip\" or scabbard, most often of lacquer; \"hyuljo\" or fuller (most genuine Korean swords didn't have a fuller); \"hwando magi\" or collar; \"ho in\" or collar; \"kodeungi\" or hand guard; a ring-design pommel; tassels; a round and wide designed sword guard, or a straight lotus design.\n\nThe Hwandudaedo (환두대도; 環頭大刀) or \"ring-pommel sword) is a type of single edged sword used during the three kingdoms area. It is known for having a ring pommel and being single or double edged. Most swords during this time was semi-uniform in nature and many martial arts practitioners tend to recognize this weapon as a \"Genuine Korean Sword\". The Hwandudaedo may have some connection to the Japanese straight swords (tsurugi) and the Chinese Jian.\nIn deference to the Neo-Confucian state philosophy during the Joseon period, Korean swords tended to be somewhat shorter than their Japanese or Chinese templates, with a blunted tip and infrequently having a groove the length of the blade. In this way the sword was made to be represented as being as singularly \"unaggressive\" as possible.\n\n\nThe Seven-Branched Sword is a peculiar specimen forged in Baekje in the order of the king. There is a theory that this is a sword that was to be a gift presented to the emperor of Japan. There was no handle found for the blade nor was there a swordsheath found for it while it was being excavated.\n\nThe study of Korean sword as a weapons system is commonly called Geom Beop (literally \"Sword Law\") while the use of sword study as a form of personal development or sport is commonly called Geom Do (검도, 劍道) \"Way of the Sword\").\n\nDuring the Joseon period, swords also had ranks depending on who wielded them and what their purpose was. The highest ranking of these swords was known as the Byeol-ungeom (별운검: 別雲劍), literally meaning \"cloud-splitting sword.\" Only two such swords existed and were wielded by the King's two bodyguards, who always stood on either side of him and held the nobility title of Un'geom (운검: 雲劍). \n\nMaster swordsmen\n\nOnly by the mid-1990s did Korean swordmaking come back to expert levels comparable to the Joseon era.\n\"Haedong jingeom\" (해동진검; 海東陣劍) This literally means 'East Asian Practical Sword' is the neologistic term for current-day swords for \"revivals\" of Korean swordsmanship.\n\nSword ownership in Korea is currently restricted (private weapons ownership was culturally frowned upon and largely restricted during other times in Korean history, particularly during the Joseon era and the Japanese occupation period - albeit for different reasons in either period), and there are very few traditional sword collectors in Korea today. General/flag-grade officers are given dress swords upon assuming command in the Republic of Korea (ROK) army. Despite restrictions on sword ownership and a lingering social preference against armed martial arts (dating at least to the Joseon era), practical sword fighting is enjoying a small revival amongst elite military regiments, and fencing is once again attracting interest in Korean universities.\n\n\nKorean historical action films have elements of swordsmanship within them. Important recent films readily available (and subtitle in Chinese/English) include:\n\nChung Doo-Hong martial arts director. Set in the Goryeo dynasty, during 1375 chronicles General Choi Jung's mission to the Ming to make peace during their wars against the Yuan.\nA Korean production that is a variant of \"Taegukgi: The Brotherhood of War\". This is set in the Three Kingdoms of Korea period where there were various uprisings in the military and many assassination attempts on the King.\n\nIn 2006, swords bestowed on newly promoted brigadier generals were changed from the single-edged curved ‘’samjeongdo’’, which was considered to be a traditional Korean sword, to the double-edged straight ‘’samjeong-geom‘’ claiming that the ‘’samjeongdo’’ is similar to the “Western sword” and not reflecting the traditional Korean sword. ‘’Samjeongdo’’ had been given to brigadier generals since 1983.\n\nOn November 2015, the Statue of Admiral Yi Sun-Shin erected in Parliament was replaced with a newly created authentic statue. The sword of the statue was longer than the traditional Korean sword and more resembled the Japanese sword.\n\n"}

Two singles, \"Telegram Sam\" and \"Metal Guru\", were released to promote the album.\n\n\"The Slider\" received acclaim from critics, and reached number 4 in the UK charts and number 17 in the US.\n\nOn the recommendation of Elton John, \"The Slider\" was recorded outside of Paris at Château d'Hérouville to avoid British taxing laws. Production started in March 1972 and the basic recordings were completed in Strawberry Studios in five days. One of the songs recorded at Chateau was \"Metal Guru\". Bolan described the song as a \"festival of life song\", and that he related \"Metal Guru\" to \"all gods around... someone special, a godhead. I thought how god would be, he'd be all alone without a telephone\".\n\nFurther recording was done at the end of March in Rosenberg Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The backing vocals by Flo & Eddie were recorded at Elektra Studios in Los Angeles, in April.\n\nLike all previous T. Rex albums, \"The Slider\" was produced by Tony Visconti.\n\nThe album notes credit Ringo Starr with the front and back cover photographs. The photographs were taken the same day that Starr was filming the T. Rex documentary \"Born to Boogie\" at John Lennon's estate, Tittenhurst Park. Producer Tony Visconti, however, disputes that Starr took the photograph, stating \"Marc [Bolan] handed me his motorized Nikon and asked me to fire off two rolls of black and white film while we were on the set of \"Born to Boogie\". Ringo, the director of the film, was busy all day lining up shots. But Marc apparently saw a photo \"credit\" opportunity and gave Ringo the credit for the photos.\"\n\nTwo singles were released to promote \"The Slider\". The first was \"Telegram Sam\" which was released January 1972 and charted in the United Kingdom for twelve weeks and peaked at number 1. \"Telegram Sam\" also charted in the United States and peaked at 67 on the Pop Singles chart. The second single was \"Metal Guru\" which was released in May 1972 and charted in the United Kingdom for fourteen weeks and peaked at number 1. It did not chart in the United States.\n\n\"The Slider\" was released on 21 July 1972 by record labels EMI in the UK and Reprise in the US. It entered the United Kingdom charts on 5 August 1972 where it stayed for eighteen weeks, peaking at number 4. In the United States, where the album was promoted upon release with a television commercial featuring the band miming to \"Chariot Choogle\", it peaked at number 17 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs & Tapes chart.\n\n\"The Slider\" was reissued in the UK in 1985 on the \"Marc On Wax\" label. All non-album tracks released in 1972 were included on a bonus disc (bonus tracks on the CD version). A Japanese CD release on SMS records dating to 1986 uses the same track list but a different mastering. Later CD releases on Teldec and Relativity omitted the bonus tracks.\n\"The Slider\" was remastered again for CD by Edsel Records in 1994 as part of their extensive T. Rex reissue campaign and a number of different bonus tracks were appended. A companion release, entitled \"Rabbit Fighter (The Alternate Slider)\", was released in 1995 and contained alternative versions and radio sessions of the main album and bonus tracks. A combined CD digipak of these releases was issued in 2002. Also in 2002, further recordings from the \"Slider\" sessions were released by Thunderwing Productions Limited (TPL), the owners of several original ¼\", 1\" and 2\" Master Tape recordings of Marc Bolan and T. Rex. These tracks were released as \"The Slider Recordings\". In 2010, \"The Slider\" was remastered and reissued by Fat Possum Records. The remastering was done by Chicago Mastering.\n\nIn 2012, the 40th Anniversary re-issue came out, a new remaster by producer Visconti, including B-sides, outtakes and an unheard demo of the title track taken from Visconti’s private collection. The set contained two CDs and a 180g pressing of the newly remastered album. In addition the three singles also got vinyl pressings. A DVD was also included with a 105 minute interview with Visconti along with archive interview clips and TV footage.\n\n\"The Slider\" has received acclaim from critics.\n\nIn his retrospective review, Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote, \"Even if it treads largely the same ground as \"Electric Warrior\", The Slider is flawlessly executed, and every bit the classic that its predecessor is.\" Andy Beta of Pitchfork gave the album a 9.5/10 grade, and wrote that the album, \"marked both the zenith and imminent approach of the cliff’s edge for T. Rextasy. Recorded in a dilapidated castle in France, it captured Marc Bolan as the King of Glam at the absolute height of his powers.\"\n\nJohnny Marr of the Smiths cited it as one of his favourite albums, saying: \"\"The Slider\" came out and it had 'Metal Guru' on it. It was a song that changed my life as I had never heard anything so beautiful and so strange, but yet so catchy. 'Telegram Sam' was also on that album and the whole thing was unusually spooky and had a weird atmosphere, considering it was a number one record and they were essentially a teenybop band\". Gary Numan also hailed it among his favourites: \"Song after song after song… and the title track; it's a not typical album-title track. You'd normally go for one of the big singles and \"The Slider\"s got a very slow, lazy groove thing. It's just great. It's just the sexiest track\".\n\n\"Ballrooms of Mars\" was featured in the 2003 comedy film \"School of Rock\", and was used as the opening theme of the Spanish TV series \"Punta Escarlata\". \"Ballrooms of Mars\" also appeared in the 2013 film \"Dallas Buyers Club\".

Ethnically a Chinese Peruvian, Chin was compelled to defend his father's homeland when Japan invaded China. He was part of the first group of U.S. volunteer combat aviators. Chin is recognized as the United States' first flying ace in World War II.\n\nChin was born in Portland, Oregon to a Peruvian mother and a Chinese father of Taishanese origin. Motivated by the Japanese invasion of China, Chin enrolled in flight school in 1932. Along with 13 other Chinese Americans, he left for China and joined the Canton Provincial Air Force as the first and original group of American volunteer combat aviators and ultimately integrated into the central government's air force under the KMT. After completion of additional aerial-gunnery training in Munich, Germany, he returned to China for combat duty in which he was credited with destroying nine enemy aircraft between 1937 and 1939. In 1939, while flying a Gloster Gladiator, the fighter in which he scored 6.5 of his 8.5 aerial victories, he was hit by enemy fire and forced to bail out of his burning aircraft, and although he parachuted to safety, he suffered serious burn injuries. Nevertheless, after several years of surgery and recovery, and an escape from the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, he returned to China in 1944 to fly supplies over the Himalayas, a route known as the \"Hump\".\n\nChin is recognized as America's first ace in World War II. A half-century after the war ended, the U.S. government recognized Chin as an American veteran by awarding him the Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Medal. About a month after Chin died, on October 4, 1997, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the American Airpower Heritage Museum in Midland, Texas as the first American ace of World War II.\n\nAfter his aviation career, Chin became a postal worker in his hometown of Portland. On January 29, 2008, Congressman Representative David Wu (D-Oregon) introduced House Resolution 5220 to name a United States Post Office in Aloha, Oregon after Major Arthur Chin as the \"Major Arthur Chin Post Office Building\".

The Atman or Self in monistic Vedanta for example is considered the Universal Self that is the same as, and not just a \"ray\" of, the Absolute or Brahman.\n\nThese seven principles can be grouped into a threefold division of \"Monad\" (transcendent Spirit, consisting of Atma and Buddhi), \"Ego\" (the higher immortal spiritual Personality, made up of the Higher Manas only) and \"Lower Quaternity\" (the mortal personality, the Lower Manas and the remaining principles). In this, the Lower Manas is a transitional principle, the soul so to speak, which can choose to join either with the Kama (Desire) principle to form the \"Kama-Manas\", which becomes an \"elementary\" or \"astral\" spirit after death (equivalent perhaps to the \"preta\" or hungry ghost of Buddhism), or link with the higher or Buddhi principle to form a higher spiritual consciousness, the \"Buddhi-Manas\".\n\nTheosophists believe that the most material of the vestures of the soul are interpenetrated by the particles of the more subtle vesture. The Sthula Sarira or gross physical body is mostly space at its atomic level, as all matter is known to be. The interstitial space is inhabited by the subtler particles of the Astral body or Linga sarira, and so on for the other more energy-like envelopes of the Soul. Because of the interpenetration of each sheath the so-called \"inner person\" is a fluid and unbroken continuity, although varying in density/flexibility and energy. Therefore, it is progressively more susceptible to its true spiritual nature as it is progressively less encumbered by material boundaries; the image of a suspension or colloid in chemistry is a similar perspective. Matter is postulated to be the physical counterpart of consciousness (ultimately our aspect being pure consciousness); the interpenetration of sheaths allows for consciousness to interpenetrate man's nature and is a Theosophical explanation of sensory experience.\n\nAs well as seven subtle bodies, there are also seven Cosmic planes of existence. However, in Blavatsky's teachings, the Planes and Principles don't match up (post-Blavatskian re-interpreters like C.W. Leadbeater reinterpreted the seven principles so they equate with the seven planes; this interpretation since became standard everywhere but original or orthodox Blavatskyian Theosophy).\n\nWhile undergoing some changes and modifications in the hands of later esotericists such as C.W. Leadbeater, Rudolf Steiner, and Alice Bailey, Blavatsky's description of the seven bodies or principles remained a central part of western esoteric and New Age thinking ever since.\n\n"}

He is the founder of the Albukhary Foundation, an international non-profit charity organization that focuses on social development.\n\n Syed Mokhtar Albukhary was born on 12 December 1951, the third child of Syed Nor and Sharifah Rokiah in Kampung Hutan Keriang, Alor Setar Kedah. His family traces its roots to Central Asia.\n\nIn 1961, Syed Mokhtar moved to Johor Bahru where he spent the next 6 years before returning to Alor Setar where he attended St. Michael's Institution. While still schooling, he got involved in his father’s cattle business.\n\nNot long after, an outbreak of Foot-and-mouth disease collapsed the company. This led to Syed Mokhtar abandoning his studies a few months prior to completing his Secondary 5, as his family could not afford to pay for his examination fees.\nWith money saved from his involvement in his father’s cattle business, Syed Mokhtar began venturing into business on his own.\n\nThe Albukhary Group of Companies is a diversified business group consisting of DRB-HICOM, MMC and Tradewinds Plantation.\n\nSyed Mokhtar began his philanthropic work in 1976 when he pledged half of his salary to 15 underprivileged families and the other half to his mother and siblings. Twenty years later, in 1996, he founded the Albukhary Foundation and today remains its primary benefactor. As of 2013 his donations have exceeded $500 million. In 2014 he was recognized by \"Forbes Asia\" as a Hero of Philanthropy due to his contribution to refugees in Pakistan, orphans in Guinea and disaster victims in China, Indonesia and Iran. \n\nThe Albukhary Foundation\n\nThe Albukhary Foundation is an international non-profit charitable organization headquartered in Malaysia which was founded on the Islamic values of faith (Taqwa) and compassion (Ehsan). Since it is founded on Islamic values, the foundation does not discriminate on the grounds of race, nationality, ethnic origin and religion.\n\nAlbukhary International University (AiU)\n\nThe Albukhary International University was founded in 2010 and is located within the Sharifah Rokiah Centre of Excellence. The University is housed within a purpose built campus and is spread over 30 hectares in Alor Setar. \n\nIslamic Arts Museum Malaysia\n\nThe museum was founded in 1998 and is located within Kuala Lumpur’s Lake Gardens. It houses more than ten thousand artefacts from across the Muslim world, as well as a library of Islamic art books. The museum has a total of 12 Galleries.\n\nThe museum has won a number of domestic and international awards and is one of the most visited museums in Malaysia.\n\nIn 2015, the British Museum announced the opening of a new gallery to redisplay all the collections of the Islamic world. The gallery would be known as The Albukhary Foundation Gallery of the Islamic World and is set to open in October 2018. \n\nAlbukhary Scholarship Program\n\nFounded in 2005, Albukhary Scholarship program supports economically disadvantaged students worldwide. The scholarships are offered to students of the Prince's School of Traditional Arts, Oxford University, IBN Haldun University, University of York, Philanthropy University and 17 universities in Malaysia, including AIU. The program offers five types of scholarships, the Albukhary Equity Scholarship, Regional Awards, Leadership, Academic & Service Excellence Awards, Campus Residence Grant, and the Refugee Education Dream (RED) Scholarship which is available to all refugees and asylum seekers registered with UNHCR Malaysia.\n\n"}

{"id": "1814025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814025", "title": "Sovereign citizen movement", "text": "Sovereign citizen movement\n\nMany members of the sovereign citizen movement believe that the United States government is illegitimate. JJ MacNab, who writes for \"Forbes\" about anti-government extremism, has described the sovereign-citizen movement as consisting of individuals who believe that the county sheriff is the most powerful law-enforcement officer in the country, with authority superior to that of any federal agent, elected official, or local law-enforcement official. The movement can be traced back to white-extremist groups like Posse Comitatus and the constitutional militia movement. It also includes members of certain self-declared \"Moorish\" sects.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) classifies some sovereign citizens (\"sovereign citizen extremists\") as domestic terrorists. In 2010 the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) estimated that approximately 100,000 Americans were \"hard-core sovereign believers\", with another 200,000 \"just starting out by testing sovereign techniques for resisting everything from speeding tickets to drug charges\".\n\nIn surveys conducted in 2014 and 2015, representatives of U.S. law enforcement ranked the risk of terrorism from the sovereign-citizen movement higher than the risk from any other group, including Islamic extremists, militias, racists, and neo-Nazis. The New South Wales Police Force in Australia has also identified sovereign citizens as a potential terrorist threat.\n\nSovereign legal theories reinterpret the Constitution of the United States through selective reading of law dictionaries, state court opinions, or specific capitalization, and incorporate other details from a variety of sources not limited to the Uniform Commercial Code, the Articles of Confederation, the Magna Carta, the Bible, and foreign treaties. They ignore the second clause of Article VI of the Constitution (the Supremacy Clause) which establishes the Constitution as the law of the land and it is the United State Supreme Court which has ultimate authority to interpret it.\n\nWriting in \"American Scientific Affiliation\", Dennis L. Feucht reviewed \"American Militias: Rebellion, Racism & Religion\" by Richard Abanes, and described the theory of Richard McDonald, a sovereign-citizen leader, which is that there are two classes of citizens in America: the \"original citizens of the states\" (or \"States citizens\") and \"U.S. citizens\". McDonald asserts that U.S. citizens or \"Fourteenth Amendment\" \ncitizens have civil rights, legislated to give the freed black slaves after the Civil War rights comparable to the unalienable constitutional rights of white state citizens. The benefits of U.S. citizenship are received by consent in exchange for freedom. State citizens consequently take steps to revoke and rescind their U.S. citizenship and reassert their \"de jure\" common-law state citizen status. This involves removing one's self from federal jurisdiction and relinquishing any evidence of consent to U.S. citizenship, such as a Social Security number, driver's license, car registration, use of ZIP codes, marriage license, voter registration, and birth certificate. Also included is refusal to pay state and federal income taxes because citizens not under U.S. jurisdiction are not required to pay them. Only residents (resident aliens) of the states, not its citizens, are income-taxable, state citizens argue. And as a state citizen landowner, one can bring forward the original land patent and file it with the county for absolute or allodial property rights. Such allodial ownership is held \"without recognizing any superior to whom any duty is due on account thereof\" (\"Black's Law Dictionary\"). Superiors include those who levy property taxes or who hold mortgages or liens against the property.\n\nThe unpassed Titles of Nobility Amendment, has been invoked to challenge the legitimacy of the courts as lawyers sometimes use the informal title of \"Esquire\".\n\nIn support of his theories, McDonald has established State Citizen Service Centers around the United States as well as a related web presence.\n\nWriter Richard Abanes asserts that sovereign citizens fail to sufficiently examine the context of the case laws they cite, and ignore adverse evidence, such as Federalist No. 15, where Alexander Hamilton expressed the view that the Constitution placed everyone personally under federal authority.\n\nSome sovereign citizens also claim that they can become immune to most or all laws of the United States by renouncing their citizenship, a process they refer to as \"expatriation\", which involves filing or delivering a nonlegal document claiming to renounce citizenship in a \"federal corporation\" and declaring only to be a citizen of the state in which they reside, to any county clerk's office that can be convinced to accept it. Mecklenburg County, North Carolina courts were slowed down by a number of defendants who changed their names and declared affiliation with the \"Moorish Nation\", claiming that they are not culpable for acts committed under the old name and are immune to prosecution because of the affiliation. Other beliefs include the idea that people can be tricked into a contract of adhesion that binds them to the government by using various things including Social Security numbers, fishing licences, or ZIP codes and that avoiding their use means immunity from government authority. Using arguments that rely on exacting definitions and word choice, sovereign citizens may assert a \"right to travel\" in a \"conveyance\", distinguishing it from driving an automobile to justify ignoring requirements for license plates, vehicle registration, and driver's licences. The right to travel is claimed based on a variety of passages, some being more commonly used among groups.\n\nThe concept of a sovereign citizen originated in 1971 in the Posse Comitatus movement as a teaching of Christian Identity minister William P. Gale. The concept has influenced the tax protester movement, the Christian Patriot movement, and the redemption movement—the last of which claims that the U.S. government uses its citizens as collateral against foreign debt.\n\nGale identified the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution as the act that converted \"sovereign citizens\" into \"federal citizens\" by their agreement to a contract to accept benefits from the federal government. Other commentators have identified other acts, including the Uniform Commercial Code, the Emergency Banking Act, the Zone Improvement Plan, and the alleged suppression of the Titles of Nobility Amendment.\n\nIn addition to Gale's white-nationalist origins, their sovereign arguments have been adopted by the Moorish sovereigns. Their beliefs may have derived, in part, from the Moorish Science Temple of America, which has condemned the sovereign citizen ideologies. The underpinnings of the theories of African-American exemption vary. The Washitaw Nation claims rights through provisions in the Louisiana Purchase treaty granting privileges to Moors as early colonists and the non-existent \"United Nations Indigenous People’s Seat 215\".\n\nOther than common conspiracy theories about legitimate government having been usurped and replaced, there is no defining text, goals or leadership to the movement. Some of those in the movement believe that the term \"sovereign citizen\" is an oxymoron and prefer to label themselves as individuals \"seeking the Truth\".\n\nIndividuals have tried to use \"sovereign citizen\" arguments in U.S. federal tax cases since the 1970s. Variations of the argument that an individual is not subject to various laws because the individual is \"sovereign\" have been rejected by the courts, especially in tax cases such as \"Johnson v. Commissioner\" (Phyllis Johnson's argument—that she was not subject to the federal income tax because she was an \"individual sovereign citizen\"—was rejected by the court), \"Wikoff v. Commissioner\" (argument by Austin Wikoff—that he was not subject to the federal income tax because he was an \"individual sovereign citizen\"—was rejected by the court), \"United States v. Hart\" (Douglas Hart's argument—in response to a lawsuit against him for filing false lien notices against Internal Revenue Service personnel, that the U.S. District Court had no jurisdiction over him because he was a \"sovereign citizen\"—was rejected by the District Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit), \"Young v. Internal Revenue Service\" (Jerry Young's argument—that the Internal Revenue Code did not pertain to him because he was a \"sovereign citizen\"—was rejected by the U.S. District Court), and \"Stoecklin v. Commissioner\" (Kenneth Stoecklin's argument—that he was a \"freeborn and sovereign\" person and was therefore not subject to the income tax laws—was rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit; the court imposed a $3,000 penalty on Stoecklin for filing a frivolous appeal). See also \"Missett v. Commissioner\" and \"Hyslep v. Commissioner\".\n\nIn \"Risner v. Commissioner\", Gregg Risner's argument—that he was not subject to federal income tax because he was a \"Self-governing Free Born Sovereign Citizen\"—was rejected by the court as being a \"frivolous protest\" of the tax laws. See also \"Maxwell v. Snow\" (Lawrence Maxwell's arguments—that he was not subject to U.S. federal law because he was a \"sovereign citizen of the Union State of Texas\", that the United States was not a republican form of government and therefore must be abolished as unconstitutional, that the Secretary of the Treasury's jurisdiction was limited to the District of Columbia, and that he was not a citizen of the United States—were rejected by the court as being frivolous), and \"Rowe v. Internal Revenue Service\" (Heather Rowe's arguments — that she was not subject to federal income tax because she was not a \"party to any social compact or contract\", because the IRS had no jurisdiction over her or her property, because she was \"not found within the territorial limited jurisdiction of the US\", because she was a \"sovereign Citizen of the State of Maine\", and because she was \"not a U.S. Citizen as described in 26 U.S.C. 865(g)(1)(A)...\"—were rejected by the court and were ruled to be frivolous).\n\nOther tax cases include \"Heitman v. Idaho State Tax Commission\", \"Cobin v. Commissioner\" (John Cobin's arguments—that he had the ability to opt out of liability for federal income tax because he was white, that he was a \"sovereign citizen of Oregon\", that he was a \"non-resident alien of the United States\", and that his sovereign status made his body real property—were rejected by the court and were ruled to be \"frivolous tax-protester type arguments\"), \"Glavin v. United States\" (John Glavin's argument—that he was not subject to an IRS summons because, as a sovereign citizen, he was not a citizen of the United States—was rejected by the court), and \"United States v. Greenstreet\" (Gale Greenstreet's arguments—that he was of \"Freeman Character\" and \"of the White Preamble Citizenship and not one of the 14th Amendment legislated enfranchised De Facto colored races\", that he was a \"white Preamble natural sovereign Common Law De Jure Citizen of the Republic/State of Texas\", and that he was a sovereign, not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court—were ruled to be \"entirely frivolous\"). In view of such cases, the IRS has added \"free born\" or \"sovereign\" citizenship to its list of frivolous claims that may result in a $5,000 penalty when used as the basis for an inaccurate tax return.\n\nSimilarly, when Andrew Schneider was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison for making a threat by mail, Schneider argued that he was a free, sovereign citizen and therefore was not subject to the jurisdiction of the federal courts. That argument was rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit as having \"no conceivable validity in American law\".\n\nIn a criminal case in 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington noted:\n\nDefendant Kenneth Wayne Leaming was found guilty of three counts of retaliating against a federal judge or law enforcement officer by a false claim, one count of concealing a person from arrest, and one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm. On May 24, 2013, Leaming was sentenced to eight years in federal prison.\n\nIn Australia there have been a few minor cases where parties have invoked arguments surrounding the \"sovereign man\". All of these arguments have failed before Australian courts. The courts in New Zealand also appear to have rejected the \"sovereign man\" arguments.\n\nAccording to \"The New York Times\", cases involving so-called sovereign citizens pose \"a challenge to law enforcement officers and court officials\" in connection with the filing of false notices of liens—a tactic sometimes called \"paper terrorism\". Anyone can file a notice of lien against property such as real estate, vehicles, or other assets of another under the Uniform Commercial Code and other laws. In most states of the United States, the validity of liens is not investigated or inquired into at the time of filing. Notices of liens (whether legally valid or not) are a cloud on the title of the property and may affect the property owner's credit rating, ability to obtain home equity loans, refinance the property or take other action with regards to the property. Notices of releases of liens generally must be filed before property may be transferred. The validity of a lien is determined by further legal procedures. Clearing up fraudulent notices of liens may be expensive and time-consuming. Filing fraudulent notices of liens or documents is both a crime and a civil offense.\n\nFollowing the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, enhancing sentences for certain terrorist-related offenses.\n\nIn October 2015, during a domestic terrorism seminar at George Washington University, National Security Division leader and Assistant Attorney General, John P. Carlin, stated that the Obama Administration had witnessed \"anti-government views triggering violence throughout America\". Carlin personally confirmed the 2014 START survey findings, saying that during his time at the FBI and DOJ, law enforcement officials had identified sovereign citizens as their top concern. Carlin referred to social media as a \"radicalization echo chamber\", through which domestic extremists deliver, re-appropriate and reinforce messages of hate, propaganda, and calls to recruitment and violence. He charged its service providers with the responsibility of tracking and taking action against, any such abuse of its services.\n\nCarlin announced that, in order to ensure that the DOJ benefited from terrorist-related information and input received from around the country, it had created a new position of Domestic Terrorism Counsel. He said the position would serve several functions: as the main point of contact for U.S. Attorneys working on domestic terrorism matters; to ensure proper coordination of domestic terrorism cases; to play a key role in DOJ headquarter-level efforts to identify domestic terrorism trends, and to analyze legal gaps or enhancements, in order to better shape department strategies for countering national security threats; and to help direct DTEC efforts by providing members with overview and insights into various domestic terrorism cases and trends.\n\nWhile arguments specific to the history and laws of the United States are not used, many concepts have been incorporated or adapted by individuals and groups in countries of the Commonwealth of Nations: Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Canada had an estimated 30,000 sovereign citizens in 2015, many associating with the freemen on the land movement, which is cannabis-advocating, politically left and green. Police in New South Wales, Australia, estimate that there were 300 sovereign citizens in the state in the same year. In 2011, businessman turned senator from the defunct One Nation NSW splinter party, Malcolm Roberts, wrote a letter to Prime Minister Julia Gillard filled with characteristic sovereign citizen ideas; Roberts denied he was a \"sovereign citizen\".\n\nA ruling from the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta examined almost 150 cases involving pseudolaw, grouping them and characterizing them as \"Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His father was a clerk in the Kedah State Service and his mother a homemaker Zainuddin Affan & Hasimah Hassan. Daim received his early education at the Malay Primary School in Seberang Perak, Alor Setar and then advanced to the Special Malay Class at the Sultan Abdul Hamid College, which was an English–medium school.\n\nBeing a youth of the 40s, during a period when the British Colonial Policy encouraged Malays to attend Malay schools, when Malay parents worried about the possible influence of an English education on their children's religious faith and cultural identity, Daim and his parents were able to transcend these limitations. In fact, his broad-minded parents enrolled all their children at English–medium schools as they did not want their children to become \"better farmers and fishermen\". However, Daim was very much an absentee student. He had worked out a strategic studying method whereby he would only need to focus on subjects that he would need to pass to advance to the next class and that required little effort – English and Malay languages and Mathematics. He devoted his free time to pursuing his main interest which was sports and more sports.\n\nCareer-wise, Daim would have ended up as a teacher except that due to some miscommunication he had been totally unaware that his name was on the list of successful candidates for Brinsford College, England, a teacher training college.\n\nThroughout his youth, he was very much encouraged by a mother who wanted him to further his studies and a father who wanted him to become a lawyer. His mother sold some land to raise money for him to study law in England. Realizing that \"time is money\", the former absentee student became a diligent and disciplined scholar in law who after eighteen months at Lincoln's Inn London and at the youthful age of 21, was called to the English Bar in 1959. It was also during his student days in London that he developed his voracious appetite for reading which till today is his favourite pastime.\nIn 2019, Daim at the age of 81 after retirement, working on the thesis regarding the New Economic Policy for 11 years finally obtained his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree from Universiti Malaya (UM).\n\nUpon his return to Malaysia from England after his studies, he started reading in the chambers of Pillai & Co. and later, the chambers of Shearn Delamore which was then the largest law firm in Kuala Lumpur. In 1961, he decided to move and work in Kota Bharu, Kelantan under the tutelage of Encik Wan Mustaffa who was legal adviser to the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PMIP) which later became known as Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS). After his stint in Kota Bharu, he joined the Malaysian Civil Service as a Magistrate, then became the President of the Sessions Court in Johor and subsequently became Deputy Public Prosecutor in Ipoh, Perak. He resigned from the service in 1965, returned to Kuala Lumpur and joined the law firm of Allen & Gledhill for the next three years till his resignation in 1968 to start his own law practice of Daim & Gamany. In 1969, however, he decided to venture into business.\n\nHis first business venture was in salt production, partly because it seemed easy and partly because his partner's feng shui indicated that he should work with water. They went to Thailand, Taiwan and Japan to study salt production, weather forecast, soil condition and location. During the start-up they proceeded to clear of the coastal land of Kuala Selangor, but because the rain came unseasonably early just when the salt had begun to crystallise, they were almost bankrupted by it.\n\nDaim's great break was in 1971, when he decided to venture into land and property development. Together with two other partners, he formed a company, Syarikat Maluri Sdn Bhd of which he held a 60% majority control. The Company bought and developed Taman Bukit Maluri, Kepong and Daim became the first full-fledged Malay property developer in Kuala Lumpur. Having ventured into a predominantly Chinese sector, he might have expected to encounter insurmountable problems, but he did not, because it was 1971 that the then Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak introduced the New Economic Policy that was an ambitious and controversial socio-economic restructuring affirmative action program. The NEP targeted a 30% share of the economy for the Bumiputera. Hence, being only a handful of Bumiputeras involved in this sector, Daim naturally gained advantages from the Government over his Chinese counterparts.\n\nHis next venture was in plastics production. After he obtained a license however, another two licenses were issued and this instigated early and keen competition to Daim's fledgling company. Furthermore, the workers were incited to strike and eventually the venture proved to be another bankrupting business. Fortunately, his other downstream ventures which included the plastic packaging company, Daibochi and the snack food factory, Sedap Food flourished and were later listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). He also invested in the Ports' downstream business with stevedoring, forwarding and low-loader licenses and had set up a manufacturing plant making steel and iron products like manhole covers and telephone posts. The success of these ventures helped towards offsetting loans and borrowings of the failed venture.\nAfter gaining a foothold in the property business, he began to look for other challenges to pursue and to prove that a Malaysian of Malay ethnicity could succeed in other fields. At the same time, other corporate and political stars were rising and Daim wanted to be \"the Malay to do it\" and so, he forged ahead and bought a 30% equity interest in United Estates Project (UEP) now known as Sime Darby–UEP (developer of the popular 'Subang Jaya' township) and went on picking up stakes in the share market, mostly strategic rather than controlling stakes.\n\nHe was willing to take risks but also saw opportunities before others. When President François Mitterrand of France came into power and decided to nationalise all French banks, Daim saw an opportunity whilst others were grumbling about the new socialist policies. He knew that Malaysian banking regulations did not allow for government-owned banks to operate in Malaysia and therefore knew that Bank Indo-Suez will either have to close its operations in Malaysia or be sold-off. He wrote a 'cold-call' letter to the chairman/President of the Bank registering his interest in the event that they would want to sell. Of course rather than closing down the Bank they decided to sell to Daim and in 1981 he became the owner of Indo-Suez later renamed the Malaysian-French Bank. Later when United Malayan Banking Corporation (then the 2nd largest bank in Malaysia) became available, he exchanged his majority stake in Malaysian-French Bank for a smaller stake in this larger bank.\n\nIn 1984 he was appointed Minister of Finance. He never lost his love for the banking industry and after he retired he started investing in small banks overseas in Europe and Africa. As the business expanded, the banks needed to be organised under a bigger parent bank and he therefore acquired Hock Hua Bank (which he renamed International Bank of Malaysia Berhad) which was one of the smallest banks in Malaysia. Again he had to dispose of his stake when he was reappointed Minister of Finance in 1998. After his second retirement he is now again actively involved in the banking industry.\n\nApart from business, politics have always interested Daim. His earliest exposure was as a student in London whereby though not actively involved in politics, he shared his fellow students interests in the political issues of the day particularly independence and post-independence implications on the socio–economic and religious mosaic of pluralistic Malaysia.\n\nHis first encounter with real politics albeit covertly was when in 1966, as a lawyer with Allen & Gledhill, the firm was appointed by the Federal Government of Malaysia to act for the Governor of Sarawak in a case against the Chief Minister of that State. Back in Kuala Lumpur, Daim was asked to attend a Cabinet meeting whereat he briefed the Cabinet members of the political situation in Sarawak and impressed upon the Cabinet the need for emergency to be declared to avert a worsening of the situation caused by the demonstrations against the Chief Minister's minority government. Emergency was declared. However, the security risk persisted and the Governor as advised by the central government suspended the Standing Orders of the House and called for a meeting of the Assembly using emergency powers. Daim assisted in drafting the statement of the Governor that the Assembly was to debate; the Assembly met, the Chief Minister's government was voted out of office. Impressed by his legal skills and political knowledge, the Prime Minister offered Daim a seat in Sungai Petani in the 1974 general elections but Daim declined, choosing instead to establish his credentials in business.\n\nCome 1977, Daim decided that he was financially comfortable enough to retire. His retirement plan then was to go back to school and so he enrolled at University of California Berkeley to pursue a course in Urban Planning. At around the same time, he enjoyed a close rapport with the then Deputy Prime Minister Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad.\n\nIn 1978, Daim met Mahathir in Los Angeles and San Francisco, when Mahathir urged Daim to return to Malaysia and contest in the general election that year. At the same time, Daim was also offered the Chairmanship of the Urban Development Authority (UDA) by the Public Enterprises Minister. Daim was not interested in taking up the Chairmanship of UDA which he deemed too big and widespread, too bureaucratic and doing too many things at the same time. Instead he suggested that UDA should form a holding company and transfer all its commercial property and commercial assets to it; only then would be agree to manage it. Hence, Peremba was established and Daim became its non-executive chairman with a team of young and bright hand–picked officers assisting him. While not many could take his punishing rigours and demands of work and discipline, those who did went on to become successful entrepreneurs and notable amongst these were Tan Sri Wan Azmi Bin Wan Hamzah, Tan Sri Halim Bin Saad, and Tan Sri Samsuddin Bin Abu Hassan. In 1980, Daim was informed that the Prime Minister Tun Hussein Onn had appointed him as Senator in the Upper House of Parliament.\n\nWhen Mahathir became Prime Minister in 1981, he sent Daim on a number of missions. The first was to the United States of America (USA) to deal with the problem posed by the USA's General Services Administration (GSA) tin stockpile releases which caused the price of tin to tumble, thus adversely affecting the Malaysian tin industry, it being a major producer of tin. Knowing that the tin miners' hardship would not move the Americans but that the communist threat would, Daim decided to take on this hard line in his negotiations with them. It worked and the GSA agreed to limit their stockpile releases to 3,000 tonnes a year for three years.\n\nIn 1981, the Government of Malaysia announced the adoption of the 'Buy British last' policy which actually was a culmination of a series of problems with the United Kingdom (UK). Prevalent was a new spirit of Malaysian nationalism which was manifested in the acquisition of Guthrie Estate by Permodalan Nasional Berhad, the Government–owned national equity corporation; the return of Seri Carcosa (premises which had been given to the British by Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al–Haj, Malaysia's first Prime Minister;) and the steep hike in fees of British Universities. To this day, very few Malaysians are aware that Daim was instrumental in working behind the scenes to resolve these issues and restore good relations with the British.\n\nHowever, the event that truly launched Daim's political career was the day before nominations for the 1982 General Elections, when Mahathir rang Daim to say that he was to contest the Kuala Muda Parliamentary seat. Within the short span of the next two years, his rise in politics was meteoric as he was appointed the Minister of Finance in 1984. At that same time the burgeoning economy kept up its momentum despite the high rate of borrowing and spending to keep the economy healthy. The full impact of the world recession on Malaysia was only felt in 1985. Internally too, there were many abuses involving the financial institutions brought about by lack of proper supervision and control. By the time he took over, Daim could not avert the scandals, crisis and failures. However, Daim set about implementing a strict code of monetary and financial management to prevent the disease from becoming terminal for the whole economy.\n\nHe stopped the practice of borrowing to beef up funds for spending, he curtailed expenditure to suit income, he slashed the allocation for the public sector – upsetting many quarters. In the years 1987, 1988 and 1989, Malaysia paid off about RM6.8 billion of her foreign debts which was earlier than scheduled, a record repayment for developing nations. The Far Eastern Economic Review, which had made dire predictions about Malaysia's economy in 1986, admitted in its issue of 1 September 1988 that Daim's effective management style had contributed positively and tremendously to Malaysia's economic recovery.\n\nDaim resigned as Finance Minister in March 1991, and the news caused a stir both in Malaysia and abroad because it was not in the Malaysian culture to resign from a high office. Therefore, when it happened there was a great deal of speculation as to why, and of course the most prominent was that which cited the irreconcilable differences with the Prime Minister, Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. For Daim, the reason was that he had accomplished his tasks – reorganised and improved the country's financial position. Further, the Prime Minister reiterated by saying that \"Daim had agreed to take the post on condition that he stay only to help reorganize and improve the country's financial position. He said he had fulfilled this task and it was time I let him go.\" In accepting his resignation, the Prime Minister also welcomed his readiness to contribute his ideas to the nation. To crown it all, the Prime Minister recommended Daim for the \"Tun\" title – the highest honour of the land. And so on 5 June 1991, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Sultan Azlan Shah conferred on Daim the Seri Setia Mahkota award, which carries the title \"Tun\".\n\nPrior to his resignation, in 1991, Daim's contribution was succinctly summed up as thus: “Despite having much of his tenure clouded in controversy, the outgoing Finance Minister has nonetheless earned the reputation as one of the country’s ablest economic architects, having steered Malaysia through recession into four straight years of high growth.” In another article, “Daim exits office having earned the distinction of being a hard–driving technocrat, who resisted pressure by rival ministers who wanted to alter fiscal policy for political expediency ….”\n\nIt was also recognised that during his tenure as the Finance Minister, Daim had implemented four broad strategic structural reforms during the 1986 to 1991 period namely the mobilisation of the private sector, active external policies, the supportive role of the private sector and the rehabilitation of the public enterprises. To this day, the tenets of his economic policies are held in high esteem and are continually pursued to either jump start or sustain the Malaysian economy.\n\nAlthough technically out of the Government, Daim was still perceived as a man to be reckoned with – an entity greater than the sum of his overt responsibilities when he was appointed Economic Advisor to the Government, Chairman of the Northern Growth Triangle, the Labuan Development Authority and the Langkawi development Authority and also the Treasurer of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the leading party in Malaysia's ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional (National Front). He was also Malaysia's representative to the East Asean Growth Area (EAGA).\n\nIn 1997 when the Asian crisis swept through Asia leaving behind devastated economics in its wake, Daim Zainuddin was recalled to public service.\n\nOn 5 May 2018, Daim was sacked from UMNO together with party veterans; Rafidah Aziz and Rais Yatim for supporting Mahathir Mohamad and opposition Pakatan Harapan (PH).\n\nPrime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir announced that Daim was appointed chief of the five-members in the Council of Eminent Persons (CEP), which served as advisors to the new government under PH after the coalition won the 2018 general elections. Daim declared the council which had held its final meeting on 17 August 2018, has ended its 100-day term as it has fulfilled the mandate given to it within the specified period.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1814064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814064", "title": "The Drowned World", "text": "The Drowned World\n\nThe Drowned World is a 1962 science fiction novel by British writer J. G. Ballard. The novel depicts a post-apocalyptic future in which global warming has caused the majority of the Earth to become uninhabitable. The story follows a team of scientists researching ongoing environmental developments in a flooded, abandoned London. The novel is an expansion of a novella of the same title first published in \"Science Fiction Adventures\" magazine in January 1962, Vol. 4, No. 24.\n\nIn 2010, \"Time Magazine\" named \"The Drowned World\" one of the top 10 best post-apocalyptic books. The novel has been identified as a founding text in the literary genre known as climate fiction.\n\nSet in the year 2145 in a post-apocalyptic and unrecognisable London, \"The Drowned World\" is a setting of tropical temperatures, flooding and accelerated evolution.\n\nBallard's story follows the biologist Dr Robert Kerans and his struggles against the devolutionary impulses of the environment. As part of a scientific survey unit sent to map the flora and fauna in the boiling lagoon, the tranquility and banality of their role is soon upset by the onset of strange dreams which increasingly plague the survivors' minds. Amidst talk of the army and scientific team moving north, Hardman, the only other commissioned member of the unit, flees the lagoon and instead heads south, a search team unable to find his whereabouts.\n\nWhen the other inhabitants of the lagoon finally flee the searing sun and head north, Kerans and two associates, the beautiful but reclusive Beatrice Dahl and fellow scientist Dr Bodkin, settle down in the swamp into an isolated existence. Kerans is still tormented by his psycho-analytical tendencies, ever analysing and debating the regression of the environment into a neo-Triassic period, but the brief quiet is ended by the arrival of Strangman. The leader of a team of pirates seeking out and looting treasures within the deep, Strangman defies the remaining civilised reasons of Kerans' mind and disrupts the world that the survivors have grown to know. When Strangman and his team drain the lagoon and expose the city beneath, both Kerans and Bodkin are disgusted; the latter attempts to blow up the flood defences and re-flood the area, but without success. With Kerans and Beatrice resigned to his fate, Strangman pursues Bodkin and kills him in revenge.\n\nStrangman and his team grow tired and suspicious of Dr Kerans, and with Beatrice now under his web of control, Kerans is imprisoned and subjected to bizarre and tribalistic rituals intended to kill him. Kerans survives, though severely weakened by the ordeals, and attempts to save Beatrice from her own imprisonment, to little avail. With the doctor and Beatrice facing the guns of Strangman and his men and no apparent excuse, the army returns to save them. With no reason or evidence to prosecute Strangman, the authorities co-operate with the captain, and Kerans once more grows frustrated by the inaction, finally taking a stand and succeeding in re-flooding the lagoon where Bodkin had failed. Wounded and weak, the doctor flees the lagoon and heads south without aim, meeting the frail and blind figure of Hardman along the way. Though he aids Hardman back to some amount of strength, he soon continues onwards on his travels south, with little idea of an aim or objective, a \"second Adam searching for the forgotten paradises of the reborn Sun\".\n\nAs with many of Ballard's later works, the novel depicts characters who seize on apocalyptic or chaotic breakdowns in civilization as opportunities to pursue new modes of perception, unconscious urges, or systems of meaning. \nWriter Travis Eldborough stated that Ballard's work, and the novel in particular, allows us to \"ask whether our sense of self—and of self as independent, sovereign, irrevocable—is itself a construction, and a temporary one.\"\n\nCritic Brian Baker states that \"The Drowned World\" \"explores the deep implications of time, space, psychology and evolutionary biology in order to dismantle anthropocentric narratives and, in turn, open up alternative ways of experiencing, and conceiving of, contemporary human subjectivity.\" Scholar Jim Clarke stated that in the novel and its 1966 successor \"The Crystal World\", \"Ballard's solitary protagonists traverse liminal states, often as psychological as physical, in which civilization recedes to the status of memory, and existence comes to be dominated and defined by the environment.\"\n\nFollowing the novel's release, writer Kingsley Amis called Ballard \"one of the brightest new stars in post-war fiction,\" and described the book as containing \"an oppressive power reminiscent of Conrad.\"\n\"Galaxy Science Fiction\" writer Algis Budrys mocked \"The Drowned World\" as \"a run, hide, slither, grope and die book\".\n\nIn a retrospective piece for \"The Telegraph\", writer Will Self noted that Ballard's work was unappreciated during his life, and that following a critical reappraisal of his work, \"\"The Drowned World\" shows him to be the most important British writer of the late 20th century.\" Writer Martin Amis states that \"it is the measure of [Ballard's] creative radicalism that he welcomes these desperate dystopias with every atom of his being,\" but criticized the novel's perfunctory plotting, stating that \"We conclude that Ballard is quite unstimulated by human interaction – unless it takes the form of something inherently weird, like mob atavism or mass hysteria. What excites him is human isolation.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1814073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814073", "title": "Ted Strehlow", "text": "Ted Strehlow\n\nTheodor George Henry Strehlow (6 June 1908 – 3 October 1978), known as Ted Strehlow, was an anthropologist who studied the Arrernte (Aranda, Arunta) Aboriginal Australians and their language in Central Australia.\n\nStrehlow's father was Carl Strehlow, Lutheran pastor and Superintendent, since 1896, of the Hermannsburg Mission, southwest of Alice Springs on the Finke River. (Carl was also a gifted linguist who studied and documented the local languages, and Ted later built upon his work.) Strehlow was born, a month premature, at Hermannsburg, the native place name being Ntaria. He was raised trilingually, speaking, in addition to English, also Arrernte with the Aboriginal maids and native children, and German with his immediate family. After a family visit to Germany when he was three years old (1911), he returned with his parents, and grew up parted from his four elder brothers and a sister, Frederick, Karl, Rudolf, Hermann and Martha, who were raised in Germany. He studied both Latin and Greek as part of his home school curriculum.\n\nWhen Strehlow was 14 years of age his domineering and charismatic father contracted dropsy and the story of the transport of his dying father to a station where medical help was available was recalled in Strehlow's novel \"Journey to Horseshoe Bend\". The tragic death of his father marked Strehlow for life. He left Hermannsburg for secondary schooling at Immanuel College, a boarding school for country boys of German stock, in Adelaide. He was top of the State in Latin, Greek and German in his final year Leaving Certificate examinations in 1926, and thus won a government bursary to study at the University of Adelaide.\n\nAt University Strehlow eventually enrolled in a joint honours course in Classics and English, graduating in 1931 with Honours in both.\n\nWith support from his tutor, and from both A. P. Elkin and Norman Tindale, Strehlow received a research grant from the Australian National Research Council to study Arrernte culture, and to that purpose returned to his home in Central Australia which was stricken by four years of drought and disease that had carried off many people, and emptied the land of wildlife.\nThe tribes of Central Australia had already become the object of worldwide interest through the joint work of exploration and ethnographic enquiry undertaken by Baldwin Spencer and Frank Gillen, whose researches exercised a notable impact on both sociological and anthropological theory, in the works of Émile Durkheim and James G. Frazer, and on psychoanalysis, in the thesis proposed by Sigmund Freud in his Totem and Taboo. One of Freud's disciples, Géza Róheim, had actually conducted fieldwork while based in Hermannsburg among the Arrernte in 1929.\n\nHis first major informants, old and fully initiated men, were Gurra, from the northern Arrernte, and Njitia and Makarinja from Horseshoe Bend, later to be joined by Rauwiraka, Makarinja, Kolbarinja, Utnadata and Namatjira, the father of the famous painter of that name. Mickey Gurra (Tjentermana), his earliest informant and last of the \"ingkata\" or ceremonial chiefs of the bandicoot totem centre known as \"Ilbalintja\", confided in Strehlow in May 1933 that neither he nor any of the other old men had sons or grandsons responsible enough to be trusted with the secrets of their sacred objects (tjurunga) (many of which were being sold for food and tobacco as the native culture broke down), together with the accompanying chants and ceremonies. They were worried that all their secrets would die with them. Several, such as Rauwiraka, confided to Strehlow their secret knowledge, and even their names, trusting him to conserve the details of all their sacred lore and rites. He was considered a member of the Arrernte people, by dint of his ritual adoption by the tribe.\n\nIn the following two years, covering more than 7,000 gruelling miles of desert to witness and record Aboriginal ways, Strehlow witnessed and recorded some 166 sacred ceremonies dealing with totemic acts, most of which are no longer practised. His academic stature firmed with the publication of \"Aranda Traditions\" (1947). This work had been assembled in 1934 but Strehlow delayed publication until all his informants were dead.\nSoon after, in 1949, he received an ANU fellowship, which, though, as he soon found out, carried with it no prospect for an academic career in Canberra, enabled him to complete further studies in the field, and travel to England for research. His sojourn left him disappointed, both with England, and with many of its leading anthropologists, such as Raymond Firth and J. R. Firth, who in his view failed to extend to him the support and interest his research required, since they were critical of his lack of formal anthropological credentials. He toured the continent and lectured, with considerable success, in France and Germany, and met up with his siblings and mother in Bavaria.\n\nHe gained recognition for the linguistic work which his father had begun. After the war, in 1946, he was appointed lecturer in English and Linguistics, and then Reader in Linguistics at Adelaide University in 1954, and became a full professor when awarded a personal chair in linguistics in 1970. In 1978 Strehlow received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Humanities at Uppsala University, Sweden.\nIn 1958 a nine-year-old girl, Mary Hattam, was found raped and murdered on the beach at Ceduna. The police subsequently arrested an Aboriginal man, Rupert Max Stuart, for the crime. Stuart was convicted and condemned to death in late April 1959. The case quickly assumed the character of a \"cause célèbre\" as civil rights groups questioned the evidence based solely on a confession made to the police which the prosecution and officers affirmed had been taken down word for word. The verdict was appealed, went to the High Court and the Privy Council in London and concluded with a review by a Royal Commission.\n\nStrehlow's involvement came after a Catholic priest who was convinced of Stuart's innocence asked him for an informed judgement on the language of the evidence by which the Aborigine had been convicted. Strehlow, it turned out, had known during his days as a Patrol Officer at Jay Creek both Stuart's grandfather, Tom Ljonga, and Stuart himself. Ljonga had been his trusted companion through many long journeys through the Central Australian deserts. Four days before the appointed hanging, Strehlow, with the Catholic chaplain, interviewed Stuart at Yatala prison. In the subsequent review process, Strehlow testified several times on what he saw as the incompatibility between the English of the confession and the dialect vernacular Stuart used. Familiar with white men in the Centre who had raped Aboriginal girls of that age, Strehlow did not think this crime fitted with Aboriginal behaviour. Stuart's conviction was upheld, but he escaped the death penalty.\n\nIn November 1971, after many years of difficulty due also to the special fonts required to reproduce his text, he published \"Songs of Central Australia\", a monumental study of the ceremonial poetry of the Arrernte tribes. Although reviewed with condescending hostility in the TLS, it was acclaimed by Australian experts like A. P. Elkin as one of the three most significant books ever published on Australian anthropology.\n\nThe last three decades of his life were intermittently troubled by the question of the ownership and custodianship on the objects, and records on the Aboriginals which he had accumulated during his fieldwork over a long career. The Government and two universities, who had subsidized his labours, and, towards the end, a younger generation of Aranda people on the Land Rights Council, believed they were the proper bodies for taking over the care and housing of this extensive material. Strehlow felt a personal responsibility for this material, as the man exclusively entrusted by a generation of elders with myths and songs, their secret knowledge and ceremonial artifacts, and held a grievance for what he considered to be the shabby treatment he had received during his life by the establishment. He set difficult and exacting conditions through many negotiations, and when the issue came to a head, determined to will his private collection to his new family, who would house and conserve it in their own home. Strehlow justified his retention of these objects by the personal expense he had laid out, and by the fact, he insisted, that they had been formally handed into his care by 'surrender ceremonies'.\n\nIn an apparent paradox, once the Lutheran mission at Hermannsburg had sufficient confidence in the Christianised native community to accord them autonomy, and yield church leases on the area to their Aboriginal congregation, many local natives moved out, claimed their \"tjurunga\" rights to the land, and began to re-celebrate the older ceremonies. In his final return to the area, he was surprised to discover that his 'twin', Gustav Malbunka, who had once saved his life, and who had not only renounced his culture but become an evangelical preacher, was capable of singing \"tjilpa\" (totemic quoll) verses that once formed a key part of rituals that Strehlow thought were extinct. The culture, even among Christian converts, had been secretly passed on.\nStrehlow died of a heart attack in 1978, just before the opening of an exhibition of his collection of artifacts, while conversing with Justice Kirby and his friend and colleague Ronald Berndt on the extinction of the bilby (the key animal in the bandicoot ritual) by introduced rabbits, a metaphor for what was happening to the Aboriginal people and their culture with the spread of white civilisation. He was cremated. His career and his role as the custodian of Aboriginal secrets have been dogged by controversy which has followed him beyond the grave.\n\nA decade later, negotiations between his widow and the Northern Territory government led to the finalisation of the purchase of most of the collection in 1987. It was described by John Morton as containing \"some '700 objects' (largely secret-sacred), '15 kilometres of movie film, 7,000 slides, thousands of pages of genealogical records, myths, sound recordings' and '42 diaries', as well as 'paintings, letters, maps' and 'a 1,000-volume library.' \"\n\nThe Strehlow Research Centre at Alice Springs was established for the preservation and public display of these works. The collection is often accessed by Arrernte people as well as other Central Australian Aboriginal groups. He is remembered and respected by some senior men as a 'ceremony man' while others feel betrayed by his use of their ceremonial material. \n\nHe married twice, to Bertha James, in Prospect, Adelaide, on 21 December 1935, with whom he had three children, Theo, Shirley and John, and to Kathleen Stuart in 1972, with whom he had a son, Carl.\n\n\n"}

While surfing as a hobby he attended the University of Southern California and graduated with a B.A. in mathematics in 1957. He married Jolly Givens in 1957 and worked for Douglas Aircraft, as a process engineer in composites. After Douglas, he worked a series of jobs involving composite materials and processes, which he applied to his surf-related inventions. He left the corporate world for good in 1964, moved to Ventura and started a series of companies that served the surfing market, currently \"TomMorey.com\" and sponsored surfing competitions such as The Tom Morey Invitational. Tom and Jolly's marriage produced two daughters, Michelle (deceased) and Melinda (artist and surfer). They divorced in the late 1960s.\nMorey has been an adherent of the Baháʼí Faith since 1970 after he came across a 'unity feast' at a Kauai beach, where \"whites, blacks and Hawaiians, mixed cordially\" \"After a couple of months of attending informal meetings on Baháʼí teachings - I realized this was very something important not to toy with; rather to become immersed in.\" \"I withdrew immediately from alcohol, drugs and sexual promiscuity\". Morey attributes inspiration for invention of the Boogie board (July 7, 1971) to a particular Baha'i prayer he kept coming across which included the passage \"convey upon me, oh, my God, a thought which will turn this planet into a rose garden.'\" He married Marchia Nichols, now Marchia Morey, \"mother of bodyboarding\", who bore them four sons: Sol, Moon, Sky and Matteson.\n\nTom sold Morey Boogie in 1977 and lived in Hawaii for a decade, working as a consultant by day, jazz musician by night. By 1977 he was producing 80,000 bodyboards per year. In 1985 the Moreys moved to Bainbridge Island, Washington, where Tom engineered for Boeing. In 1992 Tom returned to southern California; reentering the surf scene and consulting with the latest owners of Morey Boogie Wham-O. He ended consulting in January 1999 founding his own company again - Now TomMorey.com - and changed his name to Y.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2007, Tom focused on the development of a new soft surfboard technology. He handmade these boards in a small workshop in Oceanside, California. His most famous of these was the Swizzle, a parabolic-shaped longboard design. He marketed and sold the boards under the name Surfboards by Y.\n\nIn late-2007, Tom joined forces with Catch Surf of San Clemente, California, to bring his new technology to the masses. Tom's revolutionary new surfboard technology fuses the safety and durability of soft surfboards with the performance of a hard surfboard.\n\nHe had honed his talent as a drummer and ukulele player from his early youth, working professionally by the age of 12. Subsequently he performed professionally with musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie, Stew Williamson, Bud Shank and Conti Condolli. He was an original member of the 'Sons of the Beach' ukulele 1948, then, over the years founder several other band: 'Four Eyed Five', in 1950, the 'Tom Morey Quartet' in 1954, URANIUM, 1969. He joined 'Brotherhood' at the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel in 1983, and currently holds forth at Salt Creek Grille in Dana Point, California with his most recent ensemble, Laguna Jazz Quartet.\n\nIn 1946, at the age of 11, he came in second in the Green Valley Lake Paddle board Championships. He began board surfing in 1952. In April 1955 he wake-surfed (no towrope) behind an ocean-going yacht.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1963, Morey was a sponsored surfer for Dave Godart Surfboards, then Dave Sweet, Con, Velzy Jacobs, and finally Dewey Weber. In 1964 he began setting up businesses providing surf boards and inventing technologies for surf boards: \n\nHe left commercial surfboarding interests in the late 1970s and returned to them in the 1990s.\n\n"}

The occupant of the \"flying saucer\" turns out to be a strange cat-like alien named Zunar-J-5/9 Doric-4-7. Since the Mother Ship cannot send a rescue party before it leaves the solar system, the cat sets about investigating how to repair the ship himself. Using a special collar that amplifies telekinetic and telepathic abilities, he follows the military to the Energy Research Laboratory (or E.R.L.), where they hope to learn how the UFO's power source works. One of the lab's scientists, Frank Wilson, attracts the cat's attention when his theory on the power source, while ridiculed by the rest of the staff, is actually on the right track.\n\nThe cat follows Frank to his office, where Frank nicknames him Jake. Another scientist, Liz Bartlet, storms into his office, upset at Frank's sense of humor in light of such an important scientific discovery. Frank is able to calm her down, mostly by introducing Jake and inviting her to dinner. After Liz leaves, Jake reveals his true nature to Frank, demonstrating his abilities and offering to exchange his advanced knowledge of energy for Frank's assistance. That evening, the pair plan to break into the military base where Jake's ship is being kept, but must dodge Liz who has arrived for their date with her own cat, Lucybelle. Jake feigns being sick, allowing them to proceed to the base. At the base, Frank uses a back-up collar to fly to the top of the ship and attach a diagnostic device. Jake learns that he needs an element that he calls \"Org 12\". When Jake reveals the element's atomic weight, Frank realizes that \"Org 12\" is elemental gold.\n\nBack at Frank's apartment, Frank tells Jake that a quantity of gold costing $120,000 will repair Jake's ship. Norman Link, a colleague of Frank's, comes over to watch horse races and football games on which he has wagered money. Jake uses his powers to help Link's horse win the race, prompting Jake and Frank to convince Link to help them by parlaying all of his bets to win the money. However, Jake gets knocked out by a well-meaning vet that was brought in by Liz because she thought Jake was still sick. Frank informs Liz of the situation and the group heads to a local pool hall where Link has placed his bets. Learning the last game in the parlay was lost and desperate to raise the money needed, they agree to a game of pool with a hustler named Sarasota Slim. Frank's first attempt to use Jake's collar fails, but Jake regains consciousness in time to manipulate the final game and win the money they need to acquire the gold for Jake's ship.\n\nHowever, an industrial spy named Stallwood, who works for a master criminal named Olympus, has learned of their activities, as has the military. Frank and Jake manage to elude the military and the criminals, only to have Link, Liz and Lucybelle captured by Olympus and his men. They plan to ransom them back for the collar, which forces Jake to send his ship back to the awaiting Mother Ship and stay on Earth in order to help rescue his friends. Jake and Frank use a broken-down biplane to rescue Liz and Lucybelle from Olympus's helicopter, which crashes; Olympus, Stallwood and their men survive and are presumably arrested. In the final scene, Jake is allowed to stay on Earth as a representative of an off-world \"friendly power\", with Jake applying for and being granted United States citizenship.\n\n\nTom Buckley of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"The complications begin amusingly enough, but tend to become tiresome and predictable well before the movie is over. Even so, 'The Cat From Outer Space' is likely to keep the under-14's amused, at least if supplemented by plenty of popcorn.\" \"Variety\" wrote, \"The fun, as usual with Disney pix, comes in the believable sight gags provided along the way. Also as usual, it's a good cast of veterans and nothing to tax them beyond their abilities, all ably kept in place by director Norman Tokar. The aerial climax is especially good.\" Linda Gross of the \"Los Angeles Times\" described the film as \"successful G-rated family fare\" but \"at one hour, 43 minutes is too long, particularly the jeopardy situation involving the midair transfer of Duncan and her cat from a pilotless helicopter to another plane.\" Judith Martin of \"The Washington Post\" wrote, \"This is not exactly inspiring material, but it is harmless enough — unless the child expects you to sit through it with him.\" Martyn Auty of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" stated, \"Putatively aimed at the junior end of the s-f market, this 'Close Encounter of the 'Furred' Kind' is a distinctly earthbound Disney adventure film, in which magical technology is harnessed to foiling villains and rescuing heroines, human and feline. For all that, \"The Cat from Outer Space\" displays its visual trickery ingeniously and more or less reverently within the caper-comedy narrative.\"\n\nThe film holds a score of 67% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2 out of 10.\n\n\n"}

In adjectival form, the Old Norse \"nǫrr\" means 'narrow',\"\" and the name \"Nar(f)i\" may have shared the same meaning.\n\nThus, the jötunn's name, as first suggested by Adolf Noreen, may be a synonym for \"night\" or, perhaps more likely, an adjective related to Old English , \"narrow\", meaning \"closed-in\" and thus \"oppressive\".\n\nSnorri Sturluson cites \"Narfi\" as an alternative form of the name of the jötunn Nörfi, and the variants \"Nör\" and \"Nörvi\" also appear in Norse poetry.\n\nAccording to the \"Gylfaginning\" section of Snorri Sturluson's \"Prose Edda\", Nótt is the daughter of the jötunn \"Nörfi or Narfi\". However, in the \"Poetic Edda\", Nótt's father is called Nörr (not to be confused with Nór), primarily for reasons of alliteration. This name is only recorded in the dative form \"Nǫrvi\" (variant spelling \"Naurvi\").\n\nThe name of Nótt's father is recorded in several forms in Old Norse sources:\n\n\nVarious scholars have argued that Snorri based his genealogy of Nótt on classical models. They relate Narfi to Erebus, which would make , used in \"Helgakviða Hundingsbana I\" for a Norn who comes in the night, an appellation derived from the Parcae, who were Erebus' daughters.\n\nIn \"A Great Man's Return\", a song on their album \"Valdr Galga\", the Swedish viking metal band Thyrfing refer to \"Norve's starfilled sky\".\n\nIn J. R. R.

At the time, Egypt was revolting against Achaemenid rule, and it appears likely that the previous satrap Pherendates lost his life in the turmoil. The rebellion, possibly led by a self-proclaimed pharaoh named Psammetichus IV, was eventually quelled by Achaemenes around 484 BC. After the victory, Achaemenes adopted a more repressive policy in order to discourage new rebellions, although the effect was actually the opposite.\n\nWhen Xerxes launched the second Persian invasion of Greece (480–479 BC), Achaemenes was called to arms at the head of the Persian-allied Egyptian fleet and took part in the battle of Salamis (480 BC). Achaemenes survived the defeat, and was sent back to Egypt in order to resume his duties as satrap.\n\nIn 460 BC, under the leadership of a native prince named Inaros, Egypt revolted once more against Persian rule. Achaemenes confronted Inaros in the Battle of Papremis (459 BC) but was defeated and slain. Achaemenes' body was sent to king Artaxerxes I as an admonition.\n"}

By obtaining the promise from the prospective acquirer, the target company gains more time to build up other takeover defenses. In many cases, the target company promises, in exchange, to buy back at a premium the prospective acquirer's stock holdings in the target.\n\nCommon shareholders tend to dislike standstill agreements because they limit their potential returns from a takeover. \n\nAnother type of standstill agreement occurs when two or more parties agree not to deal with other parties in a particular matter for a period of time. For example, in negotiations over a merger or acquisition, the target and prospective purchaser may each agree not to solicit or engage in acquisitions with other parties. The agreement increases the parties' incentives to invest in negotiations and due diligence, respecting their own potential deal.\n\nStandstill agreements are also used to suspend the usual limitation period for bringing a claim to court.\n"}

Meanwhile, because of the Atlantic mid-ocean ridge, North America would be pushed westward. Thus, the Atlantic at some point in the future would be larger than the Pacific. In Siberia, the boundary between the Eurasian and North American Plates has been stationary for millions of years. The combination of these factors would cause North America to be combined with Asia, thus forming a supercontinent.

It featured a smart card reader and several models featured an integrated flat panel display.\n\nThe idea of a stateless desktop was a significant shift from, and the eventual successor to, Sun's earlier line of diskless Java-only desktops, the JavaStation.\n\nThe concept began in Sun Microsystems Laboratories in 1997 as a project codenamed NetWorkTerminal (NeWT). The client was designed to be small, low cost, low power, and silent. It was based on the Sun Microelectronics MicroSparc IIep. Other processors initially considered for it included Intel's StrongARM, Philips Semiconductors TriMedia, National Semiconductors Geode. The MicroSparc IIep was selected because of its high level of integration, good performance, low cost, and general availability.\n\nNeWT included 8 MB of EDO DRAM and 4 MB of NOR flash. The graphics controller used was the ATI Rage 128 because of its low power, 2D rendering performance, and low cost. It also included an ATI video encoder for TV-out (removed in the Sun Ray 1), a Philips Semiconductor SAA7114 video decoder/scaler, Crystal Semiconductor audio CODEC, Sun Microelectronics Ethernet controller, PCI USB host interface with 4 port hub, and I²C smart card interface. The motherboard and daughtercard were housed in an off-the-shelf commercial small form-factor PC case with internal +12/+5VDC auto ranging power supply.\n\nNeWT was designed to have as much feature parity with a modern business PC in every way possible. The client didn't use a commercial operating system. Instead it used a real-time exec which was originally developed in Sun Labs as part of an Ethernet-based security camera project codenamed NetCam. Less than 60 NeWT's were ever built and very few survived. However one is in the collection of the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.\n\nIn July 2013, reports circulated that Oracle was ending the development of the Sun Ray and related products. Scott McNealy (long-time CEO of Sun) tweeted about this. An official announcement was made August 1, 2013, with a last order in February 2014. Support and hardware maintenance were available until 2017.\n\nIn contrast to a thick client, the Sun Ray is only a networked display device, with applications running on a server elsewhere, and the state of the user's session being independent of the display. This enables another feature of the Sun Ray, portable sessions: a user can go from one Sun Ray to another and continue his work without closing any programs. With a smart card, all the user has to do is insert the card and he will be presented with his session. Reauthentication requirement depends on the mode of operation. Without the smart card, the procedure is almost identical, except the user must specify his username as well as password to get his session. In either case, if a session does not yet exist, a new one will be created the first time the user connects.\n\nSun Ray clients are connected via an Ethernet network to a Sun Ray Server. Sun Ray Software (SRS) is available for the Solaris and Linux operating systems. Sun developed a separate network display protocol, Appliance Link Protocol (ALP), for the Sun Ray system. \nVMware announced support for the protocol by VMware View in 2008.\n\nThe Sun Ray Software has two basic modes of operation—Generic Session or Kiosk Mode. In a generic session, the user will see the Solaris or GNU/Linux login screen of the operating system that is running SRS. In Kiosk mode, the log in screen varies depending on the session type in use. Kiosk mode can be used for a number of different desktop or applications.

The desktop can be a Terminal Server session or a Virtual Machine (VDI). This setup is flexible and works well in many environments because the intermediate Sun Ray Server layer is transparent to the Windows desktop. At the same time however, this transparency can also become an issue for software that is location dependent. If location dependent information needs to be added it is possible to extend the functionality of the Sun Ray software with additional custom scripts. The Sun Ray Wiki offers a \"Follow Me Printing\" setup as an example, e.g. a user always gets the nearest printer as default printer when going from room-to-room or location-to-location, also inside their Windows session. It is relatively easy for an administrator to extend and add to this functionality as required.\n\n\n"}

Examples of armor from the Korean Peninsula date back to at least the Korean Three Kingdoms period. Depending on the tactical situation, Korean armor also included horse-armor and other kinds of early anti-ballistic armor before the 20th century.\n\nKorean armor was largely focused on protecting against missile warfare, since the mountainous terrain made field battle relatively rare in comparison to other countries; taking fortifications was the typical way of warfare. Metallic armor was relatively widespread during the Three Kingdoms period due to constant warfare, but its usage declined when Korea was united. By the Joseon Dynasty, common provincial troops were equipped with padded armor while central units could afford metallic armor. \nKorean warfare was often based on harsh terrain and the firepower imposed on the enemy from high ground usually in the form of composite bows and later gunpowder weapons, while cavalry superiority was favored against the constant Jurchen raids during the Joseon dynasty. Fighting against much larger forces as China and Japan, Koreans favored mobility and ranged tactics which limited the reliance upon vastly armored units despite a strong inclusion of melee training.\n\nKorean armor during the Korean Three Kingdoms Period consisted of two major styles: a lamellar armor sharing the style of Chinese armor at the time and the armor of the steppe hordes, and plate armor, found in the Gaya Confederation and its vicinity. The lamellae were often of hard materials such as bronze, iron, bone, or stiffened leather; plates were always of iron, steel or bronze.\n\nDuring later periods, Korean armor also included forms of brigandine, chain mail, and scale armor. Due to the cost of iron and steel equipment that were often too high for peasant conscripts, helmets were not always full steel and stiffened leather caps were not uncommon. \nKorean armor pieces, from top to bottom, typically consisted of a helmet or a cap, a heavy main armor coat with pauldrons or shoulder and underarm protection, leg coverings (supplemented by the skirting from the main coat), groin protection, and limb protection. In terms of armament, Korean militaries employed heavy infantry equipped with swords or spears along with shields, pikemen, archers, crossbowmen, and versatile heavy cavalry capable of horse archery. Korean naval warfare saw large deployments of heavy wooden shields as a means of protecting personnel on the top decks of Korean ships. \nIt is suggested that during a period of rule under the Mongol Empire, Korea (then under the late Goryeo Dynasty) began to see a number of changes to its military, some of which endured through the Joseon era that followed the end of the Goryeo Dynasty in 1392. Japanese paintings of Korean/Mongol warriors during the two Mongol invasions of Japan (1274 and 1281 AD) show Mongol forces made largely of Korean and Chinese conscripts with shields and Mongol-style armor elements. The shields do not appear to have lasted as an influence, but examples of Joseon-era Korean armor often show adoptive influences from the Mongol period.\n\nAfter the rise of the Joseon Dynasty, Korean combat armor saw change once from mainly using chainmail, plated mail and lamellar to mostly brigandine.\n\nThe best preserved armors from the three kingdoms period originate almost exclusively from the Gaya confederacy. The armour from Gaya are the best examples of plate armor from ancient times rivaling those of Mediterranean basin from the same period. These Gaya style plate armour are categorized into three types- one is made by joining vertical steel bands to form a single plate, another by joining horizontal bands, and the other by putting small triangular steel pieces together. The first type is found in Gaya and Silla, while most examples for the other two are found in Gaya but some have been found in northern Baekje. Similar styles have been also found in Kyushu and Honsu, Japan.\n\nGoguryeo armor was a type of lamellar armour, made of small steel plates woven together with cord. Ancient tombs of the Jjoksaem District of Hwango-dong, Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang uncovered the first example in 2009. Goguryo murals found in North Korea also shed light on how Goguryo armour looked like.\n\nArmour from the Joseon dynasty can be classified into roughly two time periods, the early dynasty (c.15~16th centuries) and the late dynasty (c. 17th~19th centuries). The exact transition point from the early to late dynasty armour is still unresolved, but appears to be around the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598) and the Manchu invasion of Korea, the two and only total wars that Korea faced during the Joseon Dynasty. Throughout both periods, however, padded armor (\"eomshimgap\", , ) was popular among the common soldiers, as the Joseon required peasant conscripts to provide their own equipment and padded armour offered body protection at a low price. Metallic armour was largely seen within units stationed in the capital, which formed the main striking power of the Joseon land forces.\n\nIn the early dynasty, chain mail and plated mail that were used during the late Goryo dynasty remained in usage, while lamellar armour, the traditional form of Korean armor, also persisted with some influences from the Mongols received during the 13~14th centuries. A full metallic armour set was composed of a helmet bearing much resemblance with regards to European kettle hats with attached neck defences of mail or lamellae, a body armour reaching down to the thighs or knees, and a set of shoulder guards which protected the upper arm as well.\n\nIn the late dynasty, brigandine became the primary Korean metallic armour and often reached below the knees when worn, and the helmet assumed a conical shape. The rest did not change much as the dynasty did not experience any war after the Manchu invasions. In the mid-19th century, however, there was an attempt to develop anti-ballistic armor called Myeonje baegab. It made by sewing sheets of textiles along with cotton and combining them into a thick vest as a response towards the overwhelming firepower of rifles fielded by Western powers such as France and the United States. Although this attempt was partially in line with the current method of producing anti-ballistic vests, it does not appear to have proved effective.\n\n\n"}

Geary Boulevard terminates near Sutro Heights Park at 48th Avenue, close to the Cliff House above Ocean Beach at the Pacific Ocean. At 40th Avenue, Geary intersects with Point Lobos Avenue, which takes through traffic to the Cliff House, Ocean Beach and the Great Highway. It is a major commercial artery through the Richmond District; it is lined with stores and restaurants, many of them catering to the various immigrant groups (Chinese, Russian, and Irish, among many others) who live in the area. The boulevard borders Japantown between Fillmore and Laguna Streets.\n\nGeary Boulevard carries two-way traffic for most of its route, but the segment east of Gough Street carries only westbound traffic; at Gough, eastbound traffic is diverted by a short curved street, Starr King Way, onto O'Farrell Street, which runs parallel to Geary until it reaches Market Street.\n\nThe roadway was originally called Point Lobos Avenue, a name which survives as a branch and extension of the current street. The modern name pays tribute to John W. Geary, the first mayor of San Francisco after California became a U.S. state. (Later, he also had the unique distinction of serving as governor of both Kansas and Pennsylvania.)\n\nGeary Boulevard also has the highest address and block numbers in San Francisco, with the last block being the 8300 block. In addition, although it is unsigned and contains no habitable structures, the city's GIS database records the underpass of Masonic Avenue as the 8400 block.\n\nThe right-of-way began as a dirt carriage track to the Cliff House and Ocean Beach, two popular local attractions. For a time, a flat track paralleled the road where horsemen raced their mounts on Sundays.\n\nCable cars were operated on the street from 1880 to 1912 by the Geary Street, Park and Ocean Railway. They initially ran from Market Street to Central (now Presidio), connecting to an extension running steam-powered cars along Geary to 1st Avenue (now Arguello), whereupon they turned south to approach Golden Gate Park. In 1892, the cable car line was extended to 5th Avenue, where it turned south to reach Golden Gate Park directly. Despite its name, the Geary Street Park & Ocean Railway never actually reached the ocean.\n\nFrom 1912, when the San Francisco Municipal Railway began service, until 1956, when redevelopment projects led by Justin Herman included their removal and replacement with buses, the A Geary-10th Avenue, B Geary, C Geary-California, and D Geary-Van Ness lines all ran along Geary from Market Street to 10th Avenue, 33rd Avenue, 2nd Avenue, and Van Ness Avenue, respectively. The B Geary line eventually reached Playland and Ocean Beach after turning south at 33rd Avenue and then west on Balboa Avenue. At 33rd Avenue, streetcars of the Market Street Railway came down from Clement Street and continued along to the end of Geary at 48th Avenue where they turned north and entered a private right of way at Point Lobos Avenue to reach a car barn at Sutro Baths. This made the entire length of Geary from Market Street to 48th served by streetcars. If and when a future streetcar line is built along Geary, it will likely once again use the \"B\" letter.\nMuni bus service along Geary Boulevard is provided by the 38 Geary bus line, which is the most heavily used bus line in the city with over 50,000 passengers per day, and over 100,000 passengers per day in adjacent lines (1 California, 2 Clement, 31 Balboa).\n\nThe section of the boulevard between Franklin Street and Masonic Avenue was upgraded to a signalized expressway in 1961. It features between four and eight through lanes and two grade separations at Masonic and Fillmore, complete with frontage lanes.\n\nGeary Boulevard also lends its name to the free open source email client Geary.\n\nThere have been feasibility studies by Muni that have investigated the possibility of creating a light rail line on Geary, but no plans have been adopted. A bus rapid transit line is being planned on Geary Boulevard between Van Ness and 33rd Avenue. with a target completion date of 2022. This bus rapid transit corridor will have dedicated bus lanes which are planned to be \"rail ready,\" meaning the corridor will be designed so as not to preclude future conversion to a streetcar line, including a subway section in downtown.\n\n"}
{"id": "1814120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814120", "title": "Guillotine lock", "text": "Guillotine lock\n\nA guillotine lock is a type of canal lock. The lock itself operates on the same principle as any normal pound lock, but is unusual in that each gate is a single piece, usually of steel, that slides vertically upwards when opened to allow a boat to traverse underneath. The resemblance to the French guillotine is obvious.\n\nGuillotine locks are relatively uncommon, but many are found on the waterways of East Anglia. The advantages over the more traditional design are that the lock occupies less space, does not require room to swing open, and is quicker to fabricate and install. It also acts as a tidal lock, able to hold back water whichever side is higher, and can function as a stop lock (for example, Lifford Lane stop lock near Kings Norton Junction). It is mechanically more complex, however, requiring the use of a gantry and overhead lifting gear.\nA significantly larger one can be found at the northern terminus of the Maas-Waal Canal, between Nijmegen and Weurt in the Netherlands. It demonstrates their use when the water level on the outside, the river Waal in this case, may be both higher or lower than the canal level. Here, the water level on the river varies from about below to about above canal level. The four paddles for equalising the water level are clearly visible, but guillotine gates without paddles exist too. In those, the entire gate is lifted a little bit to allow water in or out of the chamber.\n\nThe Weurt lock has an additional gate near the centre of the chamber. When only a few short boats want to go through the lock, they can use one half the chamber, saving water. Furthermore, when one of the gates is taken out of service for maintenance, the lock can still function at reduced capacity. When open, guillotine gates are completely out of the water, so they can be painted without removing them or draining the lock.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1814124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814124", "title": "RRRecords", "text": "RRRecords\n\nRRRecords is a record label and used and new record shop based in Lowell, Massachusetts. RRRecords is distinguished as being the first American record label to specifically publish underground noise music in the early 1980s, and published the first American vinyl by Merzbow, Masonna, The Hanatarash, Violent Onsen Geisha, and many more artists who have subsequently become well known in the world of noise music. In its first 20 years, RRR has issued hundreds of releases. The label's owner, Ron Lessard, is a tireless supporter of new artists, and created several sub-labels and series to specifically highlight unknown and underground musicians.\n\nOne of the most popular of the RRR sub-labels is the Recycled Music series, which consists of used cassette tapes of pop and rock music that have been taped over with new music by a noise band. RRRecycled tapes are labeled with a simple strip of adhesive tape along the spine of the insert with the artist's name hand-written upon it. Part of the charm of the recycled releases is that each tape is unique, and that, in some cases, the original audio is still partly audible. They have historically sold for $4 each, in order to encourage curious listeners to take a chance on a band they may not have heard of. \n\nOther sub-labels have included Lowell records, which only published local rock, punk, and metal bands from Lowell, Massachusetts; Statutory Tapes, which reissued music originally published by Kinky Music Institute, G.R.O.S.S, ZSF Tapes, and Beast 666 Tapes; Pure, a series of low-cost CDs by new and established harsh noise bands, again to encourage listeners to take a chance on what might be a new name; RRReport, a magazine and CD set that existed for two issues; Stomach Ache, a collaborative label by Lessard and other unknown participants that published cheap vinyl singles of dubious provenance. Stomach Ache Records listed only a Mexican mailing address, and credited to the singles to a fictional person named Charlie Ward, so that any responsibility could be deflected. RRR has also collaborated with other labels to produce multi-LP box sets of noise based on specific regions of America. To date these have included New England, California, Texas, and Portland.\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, RRRecords was known for elaborate packaging of its records. \"Steel Plate\" is a double 10\" vinyl set by Chop Shop, which came sealed in between two 10\" x 10\" steel plates. A collaborative LP by SBOTHI, Merzbow, and P16.D4 came packaged in between two silk-screened sheets of plexi-glass. \"God Bless America\" was a 3xLP box set compilation of American experimental music which came wrapped in a purpose-made American flag.\n\nFor a period of a few years in the late 1990s, RRRecords would host free Saturday afternoon concerts at the store, which were called the \"2 O'Clock Matinee\" series. Concerts were never advertised or promoted, but every one was recorded by Ron Lessard and every band always got paid $20.\n\nLessard's Xeroxed copies of a mail order list added to underground 'zines circulating in the mid-to-late 1980s had a profound effect on the international noise communities, building interest in the music through minimal, very simple black and white advertisements. Catalogs never included descriptions of bands or records, so a new reader was expected to either already know what they were getting, or else buy things at random. Many of today's noise artists learned about the genre in part by being exposed to RRRecords catalogs. \n\nThe print catalog is no longer available, but a website has taken its place.\n\nAs a label, RRR has a very expansive discography. Some of the music was co-released with Troniks, Freak Animal, Ground Fault Recordings, SSS, Satutory Tape, Nurse With Wound's label (United Dairies), and more. Notable releases include: \n\n\n\n"}

It is a category of regressive metaphony, or vowel harmony.\n\nThe term is usually used by scholars of the Germanic languages: it is particularly important in the history of the Germanic languages because inflectional suffixes with an /i/ or /j/ led to many vowel alternations that are still important in the morphology of the languages.\n\n\"I-mutation\" took place separately in the various Germanic languages from around 450 or 500 AD in the North Sea area and affected all the early languages except for Gothic. It seems to have taken effect earliest and most completely Old English and Old Norse. It took place later in Old High German; by 900, its effects are consistently visible only in the spelling of Germanic */a/.\n\n\"I-mutation\" exists in many other languages but is often referred to by different names. However, in the Romance languages, it is more commonly called \"metaphony\" (from Ancient Greek, meaning \"process of changing sounds\", of which German \"umlaut\" is a translation). Meanwhile, in Celtic languages, it is referred to as \"affection\". A type of i-mutation is also observed in Anatolian languages, including Hittite, Luwian, Lycian and Lydian.\n\nIn Middle Korean, I-backward-sequenced vowels (ㅐ, ㅔ, ㅚ, ㅟ, ㅢ, ...) were diphthongs, i.e. ㅐ [aj], ㅔ [əj], ㅚ [oj], ㅟ [uj], ㅢ [ɯj ~ ɰi]. However, in early modern Korean, they are monophthongized by umlaut, i.e. ㅐ [æ], ㅔ [e], ㅚ [ø], ㅟ [y] with only an exception: ㅢ. However, in late modern Korean, ㅟ is diphthongized to [wi]. Also, ㅚ is unstable and standard Korean allows to pronounce both [ø] and [we].\n\nIn modern Korean language, there are two types of I-mutation, or I-assimilation: I-forward-assimilation (ㅣ 순행 동화) and I-backward-assimilation (ㅣ 역행 동화). Assimilation is occurred when ㅣ is in front (forward) or behind (backward) of the syllable. In standard Korean, only a few words are allowed to assimilate, however, exceptions are often observed in some dialects and causal usage. I-forward-assimilation adds [j] sound, but I-backward-assimilation causes vowel to umlaut.\n\n"}

Christian (born October 26, 1948) is an American who served in the United States Army as a sergeant, lieutenant, and captain during the Vietnam War. While serving as a lieutenant in South Vietnam, he was wounded in action seven times and awarded several medals including the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism. He is best known for his veterans' advocacy efforts.\n\nIn 2012, Christian was a candidate for the Republican nomination in the United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, challenging incumbent Democratic Senator Bob Casey, Jr. Christian lost in the primary election to Tom Smith.\n\nChristian was born in Gainesville, Florida, on October 26, 1948. He was raised in Levittown, Pennsylvania. Christian's father left the family, causing his mother to raise Christian and his three siblings alone. Christian's mother, Dorothy Christian, was a U.S. Army aide to General Douglas MacArthur in World War II.\n\nChristian completed his high school education at Woodrow Wilson High School in 1966. He graduated on the Dean's List from Villanova University in 1972. He attended law school at Rutgers University, from 1972 to 76. Christian graduated from Rutgers Law School in 2011. Christian also attended graduate programs at Villanova, the University of Pennsylvania, Bryn Mawr College, and Middlebury College.\n\nChristian enlisted in the United States Army in 1966 at age 17. After being rapidly promoted through the enlisted ranks to sergeant, he was admitted to the U.S. Army Officer Candidate School (OCS) and commissioned at 18 years old (making him one of the youngest officers) and making Christian the youngest commissioned officer of the 20 and 21st centuries. Following Officer Candidate School, he completed U.S. Army Airborne School, (Parachute Jump School) and U.S. Army Special Forces (\"Green Berets\") training.\n\nIn 1968, he was sent to Vietnam and served with the 1st Infantry Division - 75th Rangers (Long Range Recon) doing work behind enemy lines for the Division and the 11th Armored Cavalry under Major General George Patton IV and the 1st Battalion 26th Infantry. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism on October 29, 1968 and two Silver Stars (America's third highest medal for valor). In January 1969, Christian was critically burned by napalm in Vietnam and treated at hospitals there until February 20. He was then transferred to the 106 General Hospital (a division of Brooke Burn Center was established there) in Japan. He was promoted to captain (O-3) at age 20. He was medically retired from the Army at age 21.\n\nCITATION:\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918 (amended by act of July 25, 1963), takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to First Lieutenant (Infantry) David A. Christian (ASN: 0-5345884), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Combat Support Company, 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry, 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division. First Lieutenant Christian distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 29 October 1968 while in charge of the lead element of a reconnaissance-in-force mission ten miles northwest of Quan Loi. During an attempt to flank enemy positions, Lieutenant Christian's nine-man unit came under heavy rocket-propelled grenade, small arms and automatic weapons fire. After firing several light antitank weapons, he led an assault on the hostile strongholds, killing three North Vietnamese and causing others to flee. As he and his comrades advanced they again received intense small arms and machine gun fire and three men were wounded. Lieutenant Christian sent the casualties and the medic to the rear, and then led his troops forward until they became pinned down within ten meters of a bunker. Disregarding his safety, he assaulted the fortification single-handedly and destroyed it with hand grenades. The communists were reinforced by approximately thirty men, forcing the reconnaissance team to take cover behind a berm. Despite the enemy's devastating fire superiority, Lieutenant Christian attacked them with two antitank weapons. He was painfully wounded in the hand, but refused medical care and returned to the berm to direct artillery fire. When friendly reinforcements arrived two hours later, he directed them to cover his left flank while he attempted to evacuate his casualties. Although wounded again by an enemy rocket-propelled grenade, he did not permit himself to be treated until the other injured men had been evacuated. Lieutenant Christian's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nHeadquarters, U.S. Army, Vietnam, General Orders No. 1192 (April 7, 1969)\n\nChristian was elected National Commander of the Legion of Valor in 1978 and National Adjutant in 1980.

He was a founding Vice-President of the Council of Vietnam Veterans. He left the organization, founding the splinter group of the United Vietnam Veterans Organization (UVVO), which merged with the VVA in 1986 at the Vietnam Veterans of America at their National Convention in Detroit).\n\nChristian served as a Presidential Schedule \"C\" employee under President Jimmy Carter in 1978 and was fired for his outspokenness and the story landed on the front page of the New York Times January 25, 1979. Christian went on to serve as Regional Director of the US Department of Labor (Region 3) and then as Assistant State Director in Pennsylvania making that State the only State to be in compliance with establishing outreach centers.

In it, Zapata denounced President Francisco I. Madero for his perceived betrayal of the revolutionary ideals, embodied in Madero's Plan de San Luis Potosí, and set out his vision of land reform. The Plan was first proclaimed on November 28, 1911 in the town of Ayala, Morelos, and was later amended on June 19, 1914. John Womack calls the Plan the Zapatistas' \"Sacred Scripture\".\n\nEmiliano Zapata had supported Francisco I. Madero against the regime of Porfirio Díaz. Díaz was deposed and Madero was elected president. He took office on June 7, 1911, and soon after had a meeting with Zapata where he demanded the disarmament of Zapata's army as a precondition for discussion of agrarian reform. Unsatisfied, Zapata returned to Morelos arguing that if the people were not able to achieve justice after rising in arms, there was no guarantee they would achieve it without them. Finally, after Madero's appointment of a governor who supported plantation owners and his failure to settle the land issue to Zapata's satisfaction, Zapata mobilized his army again.\n\nThe Plan was drafted with the help of local schoolteacher—and Zapata's mentor—Otilio Montaño Sánchez. It detailed Zapata's ideology and vision succinctly in the cry \"\"\"Reforma, Libertad, Justicia y Ley!\"\" (\"Reform, Freedom, Justice and Law!\"), later (after Zapata's death) shortened to \"\"Tierra y Libertad!\"\" (\"Land and Freedom!\", a phrase first used by Ricardo Flores Magón as the title for one of his books).\n\nThe Plan contains fifteen points, summarized here:\nThe June 1914 amendment was prompted by Pascual Orozco's alliance with the Victoriano Huerta regime and therefore betrayal of the revolutionary movement. This shift in alliances forced Zapata to become head of the Revolution. The amendment ratified the original intent of the Plan and called for a continuation of the conflict until the overthrow of Victoriano Huerta —who had ordered Madero's murder—and the establishment of a government loyal to the principles of the Plan.\n\nThe Plan raised Zapata's profile and support from the peasantry in the Mexican South, as reflected by the increased membership to his \"Ejército Libertador del Sur\" (\"Liberation Army of the South\"). Allied with northern revolutionary armies, under Venustiano Carranza and Pancho Villa they were able to depose Huerta and bring a degree of order to the country, albeit temporary. Zapata quickly came to be in disagreement with Carranza and his Constituent Congress and took up arms once again. Carranza ultimately put a bounty on Zapata's head, resulting in his assassination on April 10, 1919.\n\nHowever, Zapata's successor as a leader of the Army of the South, was able to strike an agreement with Carranza's successor Álvaro Obregón about an extensive agrarian reform in Morelos, in exchange for support for Obregon's revolt in 1920. Much of the reform was also carried out during Obregón's presidency - albeit only in Morelos.\n\n\n"}

She won 19,867 out of 38,774 votes, winning by a majority of 2,071 with 67.5% turnout. During her first term, she was suspended for six months from Parliament without wages or allowances for criticising the Speaker of the House. Her suspension was unique in that the Speaker had waived the seven-day notice period required to raise the issue, and that the matter was never brought to the Parliamentary Committee of Privileges. The 83 MPs, all from the Speaker's party, who voted for suspension only constituted 43% of parliament; while this was a majority of those present in the hall, it did not have a simple majority of the total number of MPs. The suspension was widely seen to be vindictive.\n\nIn 2003, Fong inquired in parliament why she had been compelled to wear the \"tudung\" for her graduation ceremony at IIUM.

The highest peak is Crazy Peak at . Rising over above the Great plains to the east, the Crazies dominate their surroundings and are plainly visible just north of Interstate 90.\n\nThe Crazy Mountains form an isolated island range east of the Continental Divide.

She was executed in 1947 following the Ravensbrück Trials.\n\nBorn in Czechoslovakia in 1919, she moved to Germany sometime afterwards. She was first arrested in 1941 for having a relationship with a Jewish man and for refusing to divulge his whereabouts to the Gestapo. \n\nShe served 10 months in a prison in Flossenbürg concentration camp for that, and then in 1942, she was again arrested for another relationship with a Jew and served another two years in prison. \n\nOn December 6, 1944, she was arrested on charges of helping five detained officers escape, and was then sent to Ravensbrück, which had become a death camp for female prisoners at that point in the war.\n\nDue to a shortage of personnel the SS frequently used German prisoners to supervise other inmates, and Vera was among those chosen to serve, likely due to her pre-war training as a nurse. \n\nShe served in the camp's medical wing as a nurse during her stay, and oversaw the gassing of thousands of women. \n\nHer job was to fill out death certificates for the dead, and inspect their cadavers for gold teeth, which were kept to finance the war effort.\n\nBy February 1945, she was reportedly taking a more active role in the killings; now she was poisoning the sickly in the medical wing to avoid the effort of having to transport them to the gas chambers. \n\nAlthough former prisoners testified about this active role, Salvequart herself would only confess to her earlier duties filling out death certificates at her trial.\n\nAfter Ravensbrück was liberated by the Soviet Union in April 1945, she was captured, as well as the others who had served there, and held for military trials dubbed the Ravensbrück Trials. \n\nThe trials described her position at Ravensbrück as that of a kapo. \n\nAt the trials, she went on record stating:\nI remember that the sick had no trust in the beginning because they thought that I took part in the mass murdering. I must say that in their place, I would have had the same impression. I was locked up without interruption, couldn't go anywhere alone, and all they knew about me was that I lived there where they murdered so many people. Additionally, the prisoners saw when I entered the washroom in the case of Schikovsky; they heard the woman scream and therefore assumed that I was part of the murder.\n\nIn her own defense, she claimed that she had acted in a benevolent fashion towards the prisoners, and described how she saved some women and children from death by substituting their camp identification number with that of those already dead. \n\nShe claimed to have kept one infant hidden and had male prisoners bring food and milk for him. For suspected insubordination, she claimed, the SS had threatened to send her to the gas chambers herself, until several male prisoners who appreciated what she did, disguised her as a male prisoner; a guise she kept up until the end of the war at which point the allies found her en route to a camp for released prisoners.\n\nSalvequart also claimed that one of her lovers was a British spy. She appealed for clemency on the basis of having stolen schematics for the V-2 rockets being produced at the camp prior to 1944, hoping to smuggle it to the British; she was granted a temporary reprieve while this was taken into consideration. \n\nHowever, clemency was denied, and on 26 June 1947 she was hanged by Albert Pierrepoint on the gallows at at the age of 27. Other sources give differing dates of death: May 2 and June 2 \n\nShortly afterwards, her body was buried with the other executed war criminals at Wehl Cemetery in Hameln.\n"}

The open ended rings from \"Virtua Fighter\" are present (but with no ring-out), and also the closed cages from \"Fighting Vipers\". \"Virtua Fighter\" characters have new moves taken from \"Virtua Fighter 3\", including the dodge move, which allows characters to sidestep, avoiding a dangerous blow and opening at the same time room for a counter. Upon release it was hailed as one of the Saturn's best games, with critics deeming its crossover mechanics a complete success, and met with strong sales.\n\nUnlike most of AM2's games of the era, \"Fighters Megamix\" did not have an arcade release. In 1998 an adaptation for the Game.com was released by Tiger Electronics.\n\n\"Fighters Megamix\" includes a training mode, a survival mode, a two-player vs. mode, a team battle mode, and a one-player mode split into nine tracks:\n\n\nEach track consists of six fights against currently available characters followed by a final battle against a hidden character. Once the first four tracks are completed, the next three become unlocked. After beating those, the next track (bosses) becomes unlocked, and then the final (bonus).\n\nThe player has the option of switching play type between \"Fighting Vipers\" and \"Virtua Fighter\", which causes the characters to fight in either the walled arenas of the former or the open arenas of the latter and use the basic fighting style of the corresponding game. The default is \"Fighting Vipers\".\n\nThe default cast of characters consists of the entire cast from \"Virtua Fighter 2\" and \"Fighting Vipers\", as well as Kuma-Chan, a bear mascot in a hat that has no points of articulation. The \"Virtua Fighter 2\" characters have some (but not all) of their new moves from \"Virtua Fighter 3\" added. The announcer is also the same as in \"Virtua Fighter 3\". The \"Fighting Vipers\" characters still have their armor from that game, and the \"Virtua Fighter 2\" characters accordingly have new moves for breaking armor.\n\nFrom \"Virtua Fighter 2\":\n\nFrom \"Fighting Vipers\":\n\nThere are more than ten hidden characters from other Sega games. They are unlocked by completing all of the single-player mode sections except for Novice Trial, which unlocks a separate costume for Candy. Each character either plays as a \"Fighting Vipers\" character (with armour that can be smashed off) or a \"Virtua Fighter\" character (without armour):\n\nBark the Polar Bear – one of AM2's creations for \"Sonic the Fighters\". Bark is a cream bear with large tufts of hair sticking out from the front and back of his 'beanie' hat. He wears a scarf and mittens. His alternate costume is a Santa Claus-esque suit. He plays like a \"Virtua Fighter\" character and is unlocked by defeating the 'Muscle' section. He retains his home stage from \"Sonic the Fighters\", albeit without the walls and with the background music from \"Sonic the Fighters\"s Flying Carpet stage instead.\n\nBean the Dynamite – the other of AM2's creations for \"Sonic the Fighters\". Bean is a green duck who wears a neck-a-chief and Sonic the Hedgehog's shoes, without the socks. He is based on the Sega arcade game \"Dynamite Düx\", hence his name 'The Dynamite'. In his alternate \"costume\" in this game, he becomes blue and looks exactly like the character Bin from that game. His trademark bombs are still present, though changed in appearance and some functions, but he still has his three main bomb-related moves (overhead bomb spread, bomb kick, and tossing a bomb onto a fallen foe and covering his ears). He plays like a \"Virtua Fighter\" character and is unlocked by defeating the 'Muscle' section (though he is not fought until the Bonus section). His home stage is not his own from \"Sonic the Fighters\" but actually Knuckles', the South Island stage.\n\nDeku – The only original character created for the game, Deku is a comical Mexican green bean in a hat. When his hat is smashed off, a bird is under it, perched on his head. He plays like a \"Fighting Vipers\" character and is unlocked by defeating the 'Dirty Fighters' section. His home stage is the same generic arena seen in the training mode.\n\nJanet – Janet is from \"Virtua Cop 2\" and has a fondness for countering. Her moves are those of Aoi Umenokoji (from \"Virtua Fighter 3\") and can be unlocked by defeating the 'Girls' section. Her arena, Virtua City, is based upon the first stage from the original \"Virtua Cop\".\n\nKids Akira – Akira Yuki's super deformed form from \"Virtua Fighter Kids\". He is unlocked by defeating the 'Virtua Fighter' section. The default is \"Fighting Vipers\". He retains his home stage from \"Virtua Fighter Kids\".\n\nKids Sarah – Sarah Bryant's super deformed form from \"Virtua Fighter Kids\". She is unlocked by defeating the \"Virtua Fighter\" section (though she is not fought until the Bonus section). Her stage is actually Sarah's \"Virtua Fighter 1\" stage, now with the addition of neon letters that act as walls, spelling \"MEGAMIX.\"\n\nHornet – Hornet is a car (number 41) from \"Daytona USA\", the car humorously stands on back wheels and boxes with its front. It plays like a \"Fighting Vipers\" character and can have its shell knocked off, revealing body, engine and other parts below. Its voice is sounds of an engine and many other sound effects from \"Daytona USA\", such as screeching tires. Both of Hornet's costumes are a reference to its automatic (Red and Blue) or manual (Red and Yellow) transmissions. Its stage is based upon a racecourse from \"Daytona USA\" (the Beginner's course from the arcade game, \"Three-Seven Speedway\"). Once its armor is removed, it fights using Bahn's move set. It is unlocked by defeating the 'Secrets' section.\n\nRent-A-Hero – from the Japan only game \"Rent a Hero\" for the Sega Mega Drive. Rent-A-Hero plays like a \"Fighting Vipers\" character, but he has an additional handicap, battery life, measured by battery shaped red symbols above his health meter. If they all disappear, Rent-A-Hero shuts down. He is unlocked by defeating the 'Smart Guys' section. His stage is the \"Chicago\" stage from \"Virtua Fighter 2\" (the stage the player gets if Jacky and Sarah face each other in a match). It is actually unlocked before Rent-A-Hero, with the original \"Virtua Fighter 2\" music, but when Rent-A-Hero fights in the stage, the Rent-A-Hero theme music plays instead. Rent-A-Hero's stage music was changed in the North American and European release. In the Japanese version his stage music is a remake of the title screen music played in the Sega Mega Drive version of \"Rent-A-Hero\", which is similar to that of a Japanese sentai show theme song, while the North American and European versions have an instrumental version of the song.\n\nSiba – Siba is from a prototype of \"Virtua Fighter\" but was cut from the cast by the time of game's actual release, though an icon featuring him (and mislabeled as \"Akira\") appears on older \"Virtua Fighter\" arcade cabinets. Siba is an Arab in a white and purple outfit equipped with a sword that charges with green energy. He is unlocked by defeating the 'Bosses' section. His stage is based upon Wolf's \"desert\" stage from \"Virtua Fighter 3\".\n\nURA Bahn – a super-powered version of Bahn from \"Fighting Vipers\". He is unlocked by defeating the 'Fighting Vipers' section. His stage is on the outskirts of Old Armstone town, with the buildings from regular Bahn's arena visible in the distance.\n\nAM2 Palm Tree – the developer's emblem is available as a playable character by clocking up 84 hours of game time, then selecting the Kumachan character with the Z button.\n\nMr Meat (Niku) – this odd character becomes available after the game has been booted up 30 times. Mr Meat is selectable by placing the cursor on Kumachan and pressing X and opting to play \"course I\".\n\nThe rendered images seen in the game credits after completing a section of the single-player mode are unlocked and can be viewed in a gallery in 'Extra Options'. However, two of these images were altered between the Japanese, PAL and American versions of the game.\n\nAt the end of the \"girls\" course, the second portrait to appear in Japanese releases was Honey (Candy in releases outside Japan) in just her bra and thong. In the US, this was replaced by a portrait of Candy fully clothed and sporting her original \"player 2\" colors (blond hair, blue dress) from \"Fighting Vipers\". The image of Tokio with his shirt open from the \"Smart Guys\" course ending was changed. Both of these images are retained for the PAL release of the game.\n\n\nAsked what the impetus for the game was, AM2 stated, \"Towards the end of the year we always think about having a festive game for all the users who support the Sega Saturn.\" The \"Fighters Megamix\" project was kept secret, with the game not being announced until a November 6, 1996 press conference - less than two months before its initial release.\n\nAM2 described \"Fighters Megamix\" as a fairly easy game to create. Though getting all the moves from \"Virtua Fighter 2\" to fit onto a single disc had required the team to spend months developing new compression techniques, later advances in compression technology made fitting \"Fighters Megamix\"s much larger selection of moves a relatively simple task.\n\nAs a promotional effort, DJs Commander Tom and DJ MARS created a dance club mix from the music in \"Fighters Megamix\". The song, titled \"Fighters\", was released as a single.\n\n\"Fighters Megamix\" met with critical acclaim upon release. The game was awarded a 9.25/10 from \"Game Informer\", the highest score any Saturn game received from the magazine. They praised the game's roster and variety of move sets. \"Sega Saturn Magazine\"s Rich Leadbetter stated that the game was \"different enough to \"VF2\" and indeed \"VF3\" to warrant immediate purchase. The fact that it has huge depth and gargantuan levels of playability helps too.\" Jeff Gerstmann's \"GameSpot\" review stated that \"if you don't own a Saturn and have even a passing interest in the \"VF\" series, this is probably the game you could use to justify purchasing the system.\" \"GamePro\" gave it a 4.5 out of 5 for graphics and a perfect 5.0 in every other category (sound, funfactor, and control), remarking that \"Matching up brawlers from \"Fighting Vipers\" and \"Virtua Fighter 2\" is inspired thinking, and though \"Megamix\" isn't perfect, it's close to it.\" \"Next Generation\" summarized, \"Simply put, this is the best fighting game ever on a system that's already chock full of great fighting games.\"\n\nDespite their positive overall assessments, most reviewers voiced a few criticisms of the game. Gerstmann and \"Next Generation\" both noted that the graphics, while good, use fewer polygons and a lower resolution than the Saturn version of \"Virtua Fighter 2\". A number of critics also found the enemy AI too easy, though Leadbetter remarked that the difficulty was dramatically increased in the PAL version. Critics generally concluded that these issues were eclipsed by the vast and well-designed selection of characters and the interesting gameplay dynamics which result when \"Virtua Fighter\" characters are pitted against \"Fighting Vipers\" characters.\n\nCommercially, the game would go on to become one of the best selling Sega Saturn games, with over 600,000 copies sold in Japan alone.\n\nIn 2017, \"GamesRadar\" included it in their list of the best Sega Saturn games, claiming that \"Sega AM2’s bash-up mashup offers a staggering array of content for dedicated players to get to grips with.\"\n"}

Iaquinta played with his brother in the lower divisions for \"Reggiolo\" for the 1996–1997 season, before transferring to Serie B club Calcio Padova in January 1998, after 33 appearances and 6 goals in his first professional season and a half.\n\nIaquinta moved to Padova in January 1998, a club where his future Juventus teammate and Italian legend Alessandro Del Piero thrived, but his spell with Padova was short-lived as after only 6 months, just 13 appearances and 3 goals, Iaquinta was surprisingly sold to Serie C1 club, Castel di Sangro Calcio.\n\nFollowing his short spell in the Serie B, Iaquinta went on to spend two seasons in the Italian Serie C1, with Castel di Sangro from 1998 and 2000. It was with his new club where Iaquinta established himself, making 52 appearances as he became a key part of the starting line-up, and netting 8 goals. Following several impressive performances, Iaquinta was signed by Udinese Calcio of Serie A.\n\nIn June 2000, Udinese completed the signing of the young prospect and in his first season with the club, Iaquinta made 16 appearances and scored 2 goals. The following season, he made 26 appearances with 3 goals, before breaking into the starting eleven in his third season. He scored 8 goals in 28 appearances and the following season (2002–03), in which Udinese finished in 6th and qualified for the UEFA Cup. Iaquinta made 32 appearances and scored 11 goals during the 2003–2004 season, as his team again reached the UEFA Cup, this time in 7th.\n\nDuring the 2004–05 season, he made 39 appearances and scored 15 goals, as Udinese came in fourth in Serie A and therefore qualified for the UEFA Champions League. That following season, Iaquinta made 34 appearances with 17 goals, including a hat-trick in his first UEFA Champions League group stage match against Panathinaikos. Although he refused to sign a contract extension at the start of the season, on 30 September he agreed terms for a further 3 years.\nIn his final season, 2006–07, he scored 14 goals for his club in 30 appearances, and formed a partnership with Antonio Di Natale. Following a string of impressive seasons with Udinese, he was signed by Juventus.\n\nJuventus signed Iaquinta on a five-year contract on 19 June 2007 for a fee of €11.3 million. (cash plus Michele Paolucci), to become the Turin giant's first signing for the new campaign. Udinese also bought back Fabio Quagliarella from Sampdoria on 21 June; Sampdoria then bought Andrea Caracciolo from Palermo on 22 June and Palermo bought Fabrizio Miccoli from Juventus on 5 July.\n\nDuring the 2007–08 season, Iaquinta made only a handful of starts for Juventus, mostly being used as back-up to the experienced strike partners Alessandro Del Piero and David Trezeguet, who combined to score 41 goals between them in the Serie A alone. He did however still manage 29 appearances with 9 often crucial goals, such as his last minute winner versus Napoli in April 2008. It appeared that he might be surplus to requirements after the signing of Brazilian striker Amauri, leading to rumours about a possible move out of Juventus. However, nothing materialised, and Iaquinta remained for the 2008–09 season. Iaquinta also signed a new 4-year contract near the end of 2008–09 season.\n\nIaquinta started the season as fourth-choice striker, but enjoyed a particularly impressive string of performances when both Amauri and Trezeguet were injured, gaining a more regular place under Claudio Ranieri. Most notably, he scored the first goal against Chelsea in the second leg of the first knockout stage of the UEFA Champions League, which was also Juventus' 600th goal in European competition. Despite this, Juve could only draw the match 2–2, and were eliminated. After that, Iaquinta also played regularly in Serie A games, his situation helped by a falling-out between Trezeguet and head coach Claudio Ranieri. In his second season in Piedmont, the striker managed 38 appearances with 16 goals. Following the sacking of Ranieri, and the appointment of Ciro Ferrara for the 2009–10 season, Iaquinta became an undisputed starter, before a major injury side-lined him for 6 months between October 2009 and March 2010. In 2010–11 Serie A, Juventus renewed its squad by selling Trezeguet but also signing Quagliarella. That season Iaquinta made only 8 starts (7 in first half season). Despite the injury of Quagliarella in mid-season, the arrival of Alessandro Matri made Iaquinta was a substitute in the second half of season.\n\nUnder new coach Antonio Conte in 2011, Iaquinta, Amauri and Luca Toni did not play a single minute on the pitch and Iaquinta was the third one to leave Turin on 31 January.\n\nOn 31 January 2012, Iaquinta joined Cesena on loan until the end of the 2011–12 season. He made his debut for them on 9 February away at Lazio, and assisted Adrian Mutu for the first goal and scored a penalty to put Cesena 2–0 up at half-time, but they eventually lost 3–2. In total he made 7 appearances for the club, although his time with Cesena was once again characterised by injuries, and he was unable to save the club from relegation.\n\nAt the end of the season he returned to his home club Juventus, who had just won the league title, although he continued to struggle with injuries, and once again failed to make a single appearance under Conte during the 2012–13 Serie A season, as Juventus won a second consecutive league title. On 22 July 2013, following the end of his contract with the club, he announced his retirement, stating his intention to pursue a coaching career.\n\nIaquinta made his international debut for Italy on 30 March 2005, as a half-time substitute for Luca Toni in a 0–0 home friendly draw against Iceland at the Stadio Euganeo in Padua.\n\nIaquinta was a member of the Italian squad that won the 2006 FIFA World Cup under manager Marcello Lippi. His first international goal came in his nation's opening match of the tournament, on 12 Junve: Iaquinta scored Italy's second goal in the 2–0 victory against Ghana. He played in 5 out of 7 of Italy's matches, including the victorious semi-final against hosts Germany and final against France on 9 July, in which he came on after 61 minutes for Simone Perrotta. Iaquinta missed out on Roberto Donadoni's Italy squad for Euro 2008 due to injury. He later took part at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, and he also played for Italy in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, in which he scored a penalty in a 1–1 draw against New Zealand in the second group match. His 40th and final international appearance came in the last group game on 24 June, in which Italy were defeated 3–2 by Slovakia and eliminated from the tournament. In total he scored six goals for Italy.\n\nIn his prime, Iaquinta was a tall, physically strong, opportunistic, and extremely fast striker, who excelled in the air and at finishing off chances inside the penalty area. Due to his great pace, athleticism, work-rate, tenacity, and good movement off the ball, he was also known for his ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line and either get on the end of his teammates' passes or provide depth and create space for his team; his speed and timing also made him a dangerous offensive threat on counter-attacks. Although his preferred role was that of a striker, he was a versatile forward who was capable of playing in several offensive positions, and was also used as a second striker, or as a winger. Due to his strength, he excelled at playing with his back to goal, and at holding the ball up for teammates. Iaquinta was often injury-prone throughout his career, which frequently limited his playing time.\n\nIaquinta has been married to Arianna Cucinotta since 14 June 2003. He and his wife have four children, two sons and two daughters: Giuseppe, born on 17 December 2002, Edoardo, born on 28 June 2004, Carlotta, born on 20 May 2008, and Ginevra, born on 23 April 2015.\n\nDuring the Aemilia antimafia investigation, on 4 February 2015 illegal weapons were found at Iaquinta's Quattro Castella home and his father Giuseppe's home. On 21 December 2015, they were both sent to trial for the illegal possession of firearms, aggravated by the aiding of the Calabrian Mafia organization 'Ndrangheta expand to Northern Italy, of which his father was charged with association with the 'Ndrangheta through the 'Ndrina of Nicolino Grande Aracri. On 31 October 2018, Iaquinta was found guilty of illegal possession of firearms, and sentenced to two years imprisonment; his father was found guilty of mafia association, and received 19 years imprisonment.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Chopin's music is integral to the film, with pianist Janusz Olejniczak playing his works. Two versions of the film were shot—in Polish and English—with British actors later lip-syncing the dialogue. Antczak spent 25 years writing the screenplay and six years raising the budget for the film.\n\nThe film was screened at Houston Film Festival in 2003 and won the Gold Award for Best Cinematography and the Platinum Award for Best Drama.\n\nThe film starts when Frédéric Chopin is still a young man living with his parents and his two sisters in Warsaw where he frequently plays the piano and composes music for the decidedly unmusical Grand Duke Constantine. Shortly before the November Uprising, Chopin's father urges him to leave for Paris, which Frédéric does. Once in Paris he meets novelist George Sand, who has just split from her violent lover Mallefille. Although he is immediately drawn to Sand, he initially refuses her advances. However, after several months, their mutual friend Albert urges Chopin to get to know George better and a passionate romance starts to build. During their affair, Chopin is diagnosed with tuberculosis and has to cope with a declining health. The relationship is further complicated by George's two children: Maurice and Solange. While Maurice's near-hysterical hatred of Chopin leads from one escalation to the other, Solange develops an obsessive love for Chopin which leads to a rivalry between Solange and her mother. After several years of constant fighting between Chopin, George, Maurice and Solange, the relationship ends and Chopin calls for one of his sisters to help him get through the last days of his life.\n\n\n"}

He attended the Kraków Academy at which he attained bachelor, and licentiate. In 1418 he became a Doctor of Philosophy. Upon graduation he spent the next three years conducting philosophy classes at the university, while preparing for the priesthood.\n\nUpon his ordination, he became rector at the school of the Canons Regular of the Most Holy Sepulcher in Miechow. While there, he was offered a professorship of \"Sacra Scriptura\" (Sacred Scripture) back at his alma mater, the Kraków Academy, which would later be named the Jagiellonian University. He attained a doctorate in theology and eventually became director of the theology department. He held the professorship until his death in 1473. Cantius spent many hours copying manuscripts of the Holy Scriptures, theological tracts, and other scholarly works.\n\nIn physics, he helped develop Jean Buridan's theory of impetus, which anticipated the work of Galileo and Newton.\n\nDuring his time in Kraków, Cantius became well known in the city for his generosity and compassion toward the poor, especially needy students at the university. He subsisted on what was strictly necessary to sustain his life, giving alms regularly to the poor. He made one pilgrimage to Jerusalem and four pilgrimages on foot to Rome.\n\nMichael Miechowita, the medieval Polish historian and Cantius's first biographer, described Cantius's extreme humility and charity; he took as his motto:\n\nHe died while living in retirement at his alma mater on 24 December 1473, aged 83. His remains were interred in the Collegiate Church of St Anne, where his tomb became and remains a popular pilgrimage site. He is the patron of the diocese of Bielsko-Żywiec (since 1992), and of the students.\n\nJohn Cantius was beatified in Rome by Pope Clement X on 28 March 1676. He was named patron of Poland and Lithuania by Pope Clement XII in the year 1737. Ninety-one years after his beatification, John Cantius was canonized on 16 July 1767, by Pope Clement XIII.\n\nThe Roman Breviary distinguishes him with three hymns; he is the only confessor not a bishop who has been given this honor in the Catholic liturgy.\n\nSt. John Cantius is a popular saint in Poland. A number of churches and schools founded by Polish diaspora communities throughout North America are named in his honor, in cities as far-ranging as Cleveland, Ohio; Winnipeg, Manitoba; Detroit, Michigan; Chicago, Illinois; Rolling Prairie, Indiana, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; St. Cloud, Minnesota; Wilno, Minnesota, Philadelphia, Erie, and Windber, Pennsylvania; New York City and Buffalo, New York.\n\n\"John Cantius\" has been used as a first and middle name—see, for example, John Cantius Garand.\n\nIn 1998, a new religious institute was founded, based in Chicago, which took St. John Cantius as their patron saint. Thus they are the Canons Regular of Saint John Cantius.\n\nWhen St. John Cantius's feast day was first inserted into the General Roman Calendar in 1770, it was initially assigned to 20 October, but in the calendar reform of 1969 it was moved to 23 December, the day before the anniversary of his death, which occurred on Christmas Eve 1473. Those who, as authorized by Pope Benedict XVI in \"Summorum Pontificum\", use the 1962 Roman Missal continue to celebrate it on 20 October as a III Class Feast.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1814209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814209", "title": "Golden-section search", "text": "Golden-section search\n\nThe golden-section search is a technique for finding an extremum (minimum or maximum) of a function inside a specified interval. For a strictly unimodal function with an extremum inside the interval, it will find that extremum, while for an interval containing multiple extrema (possibly including the interval boundaries), it will converge to one of them. If the only extremum on the interval is on a boundary of the interval, it will converge to that boundary point. The method operates by successively narrowing the range of values on the specified interval, which makes it relatively slow, but very robust. The technique derives its name from the fact that the algorithm maintains the function values for four points whose three interval widths are in the ratio \"2-φ:2φ-3:2-φ\" where \"φ\" is the golden ratio. These ratios are maintained for each iteration and are maximally efficient. Excepting boundary points, when searching for a minimum, the central point is always less than or equal to the outer points, assuring that a minimum is contained between the outer points. The converse is true when searching for a maximum. The algorithm is the limit of Fibonacci search (also described below) for many function evaluations. Fibonacci search and golden-section search were discovered by Kiefer (1953) (see also Avriel and Wilde (1966)).\n\nThe discussion here is posed in terms of searching for a minimum (searching for a maximum is similar) of a unimodal function. Unlike finding a zero, where two function evaluations with opposite sign are sufficient to bracket a root, when searching for a minimum, three values are necessary. The golden-section search is an efficient way to progressively reduce the interval locating the minimum. The key is to observe that regardless of how many points have been evaluated, the minimum lies within the interval defined by the two points adjacent to the point with the least value so far evaluated.\n\nThe diagram above illustrates a single step in the technique for finding a minimum. The functional values of formula_1 are on the vertical axis, and the horizontal axis is the \"x\" parameter. The value of formula_1 has already been evaluated at the three points: formula_3, formula_4, and formula_5. Since formula_6 is smaller than either formula_7 or formula_8, it is clear that a minimum lies inside the interval from formula_3 to formula_5.\n\nThe next step in the minimization process is to \"probe\" the function by evaluating it at a new value of \"x\", namely formula_11. It is most efficient to choose formula_11 somewhere inside the largest interval, i.e. between formula_4 and formula_5. From the diagram, it is clear that if the function yields formula_15, then a minimum lies between formula_3 and formula_11, and the new triplet of points will be formula_3, formula_4, and formula_11. However, if the function yields the value formula_21, then a minimum lies between formula_4 and formula_5, and the new triplet of points will be formula_4, formula_11, and formula_5. Thus, in either case, we can construct a new narrower search interval that is guaranteed to contain the function's minimum.\n\nFrom the diagram above, it is seen that the new search interval will be either between formula_3 and formula_11 with a length of \"a\" + \"c\", or between formula_4 and formula_5 with a length of \"b\". The golden-section search requires that these intervals be equal. If they are not, a run of \"bad luck\" could lead to the wider interval being used many times, thus slowing down the rate of convergence. To ensure that \"b\" = \"a\" + \"c\", the algorithm should choose formula_31.\n\nHowever, there still remains the question of where formula_4 should be placed in relation to formula_3 and formula_5. The golden-section search chooses the spacing between these points in such a way that these points have the same proportion of spacing as the subsequent triple formula_35 or formula_36. By maintaining the same proportion of spacing throughout the algorithm, we avoid a situation in which formula_4 is very close to formula_3 or formula_5 and guarantee that the interval width shrinks by the same constant proportion in each step.\n\nMathematically, to ensure that the spacing after evaluating formula_40 is proportional to the spacing prior to that evaluation, if formula_40 is formula_15 and our new triplet of points is formula_3, formula_4, and formula_11, then we want\n\nHowever, if formula_40 is formula_21 and our new triplet of points is formula_4, formula_11, and formula_5, then we want\n\nEliminating \"c\" from these two simultaneous equations yields\n\nor\n\nwhere φ is the golden ratio:\n\nThe appearance of the golden ratio in the proportional spacing of the evaluation points is how this search algorithm gets its name.\n\nAny number of termination conditions may be applied, depending upon the application. The interval \"ΔX=X-X\" is a measure of the absolute error in the estimation of the minimum \"X\" and may be used to terminate the algorithm. The value of \"ΔX\" is reduced by a factor of \"r=1-φ\" for each iteration, so the number of iterations to reach an absolute error of \"ΔX\" is about \"ln(ΔX/ΔX) / ln(r)\" where \"ΔX\" is the initial value of \"ΔX\". \n\nBecause smooth functions are flat (their first derivative is close to zero) near a minimum, attention must be paid not to expect too great an accuracy in locating the minimum. The termination condition provided in the book Numerical Recipes in C is based on testing the gaps among formula_3, formula_4, formula_5 and formula_11, terminating when within the relative accuracy bounds\n\nwhere formula_61 is a tolerance parameter of the algorithm, and formula_62 is the absolute value of formula_63. The check is based on the bracket size relative to its central value, because that relative error in formula_63 is approximately proportional to the squared absolute error in formula_1 in typical cases. For that same reason, the Numerical Recipes text recommends that formula_66, where formula_67 is the required absolute precision of formula_1.\n\n\"\"\"Python program for golden section search.

In order to approximate the probe positions of golden section search while probing only integer sequence indices, the variant of the algorithm for this case typically maintains a bracketing of the solution in which the length of the bracketed interval is a Fibonacci number. For this reason, the sequence variant of golden section search is often called \"Fibonacci search\".\n\nFibonacci search was first devised by Kiefer (1953) as a minimax search for the maximum (minimum) of a unimodal function in an interval.\n\n\n"}

Monte Rosa is the second highest mountain in the Alps and western Europe, after Mont Blanc.\n\nThe group is located on the watershed between central and southern Europe.\n\nThe Monte Rosa massif has four faces. Three in Italy: the Liskamm heading above the Val de Gressoney, the Valsesian face above Alagna Valsesia at the upper part of the Valle della Sesia, and the steep, big east wall above Macugnaga in the Valle Anzasca. And the Swiss north-western face with several glaciers (with one of the largest Alpine glaciers) flowing towards the Mattertal with Zermatt.\n\nIts main summit, named Dufourspitze in honor of the surveyor Guillaume-Henri Dufour and wholly located in Switzerland, culminates at above sea level and is followed by the five nearly equally high subsidiary summits of Dunantspitze, Grenzgipfel, Nordend, Zumsteinspitze and Signalkuppe. Some other over 4000 m peaks such as Piramide Vincent, Punta Giordani, and Corno Nero are wholly in Italy. Monte Rosa is the highest mountain of both Switzerland and the Pennine Alps and is also the second-highest mountain of the Alps and Europe outside the Caucasus.\n\nThe north-west side of the central Monte Rosa massif, with its enormous ice slopes and seracs, constitutes the boundary and upper basin of the large Gorner Glacier, which descends towards Zermatt and merges with its nowadays much larger tributary, the Grenzgletscher (), right below the Monte Rosa Hut on the lower end of the visible western wing. The Grenzgletscher is an impressive glacier formation between the western wing of the mountain and Liskamm, a ridge on its southwestern side on the Swiss-Italian border. On the eastern side, in Italy, the mountain falls away in an almost vertical wall of granite and ice, the biggest in Europe, overlooking Macugnaga and several smaller glaciers.\n\nMonte Rosa was studied by pioneering geologists and explorers, including Leonardo da Vinci in the late fifteenth century and Horace-Bénédict de Saussure in the late eighteenth century. Following a long series of attempts beginning in the early nineteenth century, Monte Rosa's summit, then still called \"Höchste Spitze\" ( “Highest Peak”), was first reached in 1855 from Zermatt by a party of eight climbers led by three guides. The great east wall was first climbed in 1872, from Macugnaga.\n\nEach summer many climbers set out from the Monte Rosa Hut on the mountain's west wing for one of its summits via the normal route or for the Margherita Hut on the Signalkuppe (), used as a research station. Many tourists and hikers also come each year to the Gornergrat on the north-west side of the massif, to see the panorama that extends over the giants of the Alps, from Monte Rosa to the Matterhorn.\n\nThough the Italian as well as the French both mean \"pink\", the name is a false cognate derived from the Franco-Provençal Valdôtain \"patois\" word \"rouése\", meaning \"glacier\". On old maps as late as 1740, the mountain was named \"Monte Bosa\" and even \"Monte Biosa\" by the inhabitants of Val Sesia. The name \"Mon Boso\" which appears in Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks very likely designated the same mountain. From Zermatt the mountain was formerly known under the name \"Gornerhorn\" (in Walliser German, “Large/Strong Horn”). The name \"gorner\" is still used for the western ridge that is thrown out from the main mass (\"Gornergrat\") and the glacier that lies at its foot (\"Gornergletscher\") but not used for the mountain itself anymore. Nowadays, in German, the Italian \"Monte Rosa\" is used instead (\"Monte Rosa-Gletscher\", \"Monte Rosa-Hütte\", etc.).\n\nMonte Rosa cover areas on both sides of the border between the Swiss canton of Valais and the Italian regions of Piedmont and Aosta Valley. The main summit of Monte Rosa is the Dufourspitze. On the Swiss side the town centre of Zermatt is about south-east and above it. On the Italian side of the massif are located north-east Macugnaga in the Valle Anzasca,south-east-south Alagna Valsesia in the Valsesia and Gressoney-La-Trinité in the Val de Gressoney, respectively, away from the summit. The different sides of the mountain greatly differ from each other. The Swiss west side is almost completely covered by large glaciers, tributaries of the large Gorner Glacier, descending progressively with gentle slopes and forming a large uninhabited glacial valley. The Italian east side consists of a wall overlooking Macugnaga, whose snows feed the Belvedere Glacier at its base. The southeast face, culminating at the Signalkuppe, overlooks the piedmontese Valsesia () and the Val de Gressoney in the autonomous region of Aosta Valley.\n\nThe mountain is mainly covered by eternal snows and glaciers, except for its summit which is a rocky ridge orientated west–east, near to and perpendicular to the main watershed between Switzerland and Italy (the river basins of the Rhône and the Po on the Swiss and Italian side, respectively). The connecting point between them is the Grenzgipfel () right on the border, and therefore also the highest peak on the Italian side. Thus Monte Rosa is the highest mountain in the Alps whose summit is not on the main alpine watershed, although it is off by only 150 metres. The Silbersattel () and Grenzsattel () are the passes located north and south to the summit. The three main secondary summits of Monte Rosa are (from north to south): the Nordend (4,609 m; north of the Dufourspitze), the Zumsteinspitze (4,563 m; south of the Dufourspitze) and the Signalkuppe (4,554 m, ), all of them being positioned right on the Swiss-Italian border. Other secondary summits are the Parrotspitze (4,432 m), the Ludwigshöhe (4,341 m) and the Vincentpiramid (4,215 m). All of them originally have German names, since even the Italian valleys used to be by German-based Walsers inhabited valleys.\n\nSeveral perpendicular secondary ridges are connected to the central massif dividing the glaciers that descend towards the Matter Valley. The ridge called Weissgrat connecting the Nordend with the Schwarzberghorn () presents a wall of formidable precipices towards the east, but falls away in a gentle slope to the west. For a breadth of a few kilometres the upper snow-fields of the Weissgrat lie almost unbroken upon this slope, but as they begin to descend towards the Matter Valley they are divided into two icestreams (the upper Gorner Glacier and the Findel Glacier) by a ridge which gradually emerges from the névé, and finally presents a rather bold front to the glaciers on either side. The highest points of this ridge, appearing insignificant by contrast with the grand objects around, is the Stockhorn (3,532 m)) and the lower Gornergrat at 3,090 m. On their south sides is the lower Gorner Glacier, formed by the confluence of all the major (Gornergletscher and Grenzgletscher) and minor tributaries descending from the north, west and south sides of the central Monte Rosa massif, while on the north side the Findel Glacier descends near to the hamlet of Findeln.\n\nMonte Rosa is one of the high mountains surrounding the Matter Valley south of Stalden. On the southwest to west are Liskamm, Zwillinge with Castor and Pollux, the Breithorn and the Matterhorn; on the north are the Weisshorn and the Dom. The Gornergrat summit, lying on the north-west at , is a popular view point of the massif, since it is accessible by train from Zermatt, using the highest open air railway line in Europe.\n\nThe extended range of Monte Rosa, which appears to originate in the intersection of two axes of great elevation, throws out a number of ridges that radiate afar and gradually subside into the plain of northern Italy, covering a relatively large area. There are no convenient mode of subdividing the range. However the natural limits of the district can be defined on the north side by the two branches of the Visp torrent. Following the west branch through the Mattertal, crossing the Theodul Pass, descending by the Valtournanche to Châtillon and to Ivrea, and passing round the base of the mountains by Arona, along Lake Maggiore, and up the valley of the Toce, to Vogogna, then ascending by the Val Anzasca to the Monte Moro Pass, the circuit is completed by the descent through the Saastal to Stalden. Within the line so traced, exceeding 450 km in length, all the ranges properly belonging to this group are included.\nThe direction of the ranges and the depressions offers a marked contrast to that prevailing throughout the adjoining regions of the Alps. Unless in a small part of the Italian valleys, the direction here is either parallel or perpendicular to the meridian. Monte Rosa itself lies near the intersection of a great north and south ridge, extending from the Balfrin through the Mischabelhörner, and the highest peaks of the mountain itself, to the Vincent Pyramide, and thence through the range that bounds the Valle di Gressoney, nearly to Ivrea, with the transverse range lying between the Dent d'Herens and the Pizzo Bianco near Macugnaga. The minor ridges on the north side of the border are parallel to this latter range, with their corresponding depressions occupied by the glaciers of Gorner and Findelen.\n\nOn clear days the mountainous massif of Monte Rosa provides a striking view from the Po plain, particularly its upper reaches in western Lombardy and eastern Piedmont. It dominates the horizon, towering between other lesser Alpine peaks as a prominent, multi-pointed, razor-sharp bulge, its permanent glaciers shining under the sun.\n\nThe massif is the border between Switzerland and Italy, though glacial melt has caused some alterations to the border. These changes were ratified by the two countries in 2009 and will continue to be subject to change as melting continues.\n\nThe entire massif consists mainly of granite and granite gneiss (a metamorphic rock with foliations). The \"Monte Rosa Nappe\" lies below the Zermatt-Saas zone and is part of the Penninic nappes in the Briançonnais microcontinent zone, although its paleographic origin is controversial and is sometimes assigned to the Sub-Penninic nappes. Rocks in the paragneiss of the Monte Rosa Nappe record eclogite-facies metamorphism. The deformation of the Monte Rosa granites indicates a depth of subduction of about 60 km. They were brought to the surface by tectonic uplift, which still continues today.\nThe summit is a sharp, jagged edge of mica schist connected by an arête with the Nordend, but cut off from the Zumsteinspitze to the south by nearly vertical rocks about in height.\nBelow the Mount Rosa there 's a 20 squared kilometer gold field .It's larger than the most productive Southafrican active gold mines.The last mine because of extraction costs, environmental problems and security issues was halted on the Italian side of the massif in 1961.\n\nBeing the highest point in Switzerland, Monte Rosa is also one of the most extreme places. The average air pressure is about half of that of the sea level (56%) and the temperature can reach as low as . Owing to the frequent prevalence of a high wind from the east or north-east, and the slow pace at which it is possible to move when near the top, precautions against cold are particularly requisite when climbing Monte Rosa. The snow line is located at about .\n\nThe Monte Rosa massif is popular for mountaineering, hiking, skiing and snowboarding. It hosts several ski resorts with long pistes. Plateau Rosa, about 3,500 metres high above sea level, is a renowned summer ski resort, with permanent snow all year round due to the altitude. The Plateau Rosa is connected via aerial tramway to Cervinia and to Zermatt via the Klein Matterhorn. The western fringes of the massif reach the Zermatt ski domain. Gressoney, Champoluc, Alagna Valsesia and Macugnaga (under the impressive east face, intensely glaciated and some 2,500 metres high) are the main mountain and ski resorts that surround Monte Rosa along its southern side. Monte Rosa is not technically difficult to climb in itself, despite hosting some quite impressive ridges, but can be quite dangerous due to its great altitude and sudden weather changes, as well as crevasses in its extensive glaciers - one of the major glaciated areas in the Alps.\n\nThe Tour of Monte Rosa can be effected by trekkers in about 10 days. The circuit follows many ancient trails that have linked the Swiss and Italian valleys for centuries. The circuit includes larch forests, alpine meadows, balcony trails and a glacial crossing. It connects seven valleys embracing different cultures: the German speaking high Valais, the Arpitan speaking Aosta Valley and the valleys of Lombardy and Piedmont. Good conditions are necessary to circumnavigate the massif. After reaching Saint-Jacques by the Theodul Pass and the Col des Cimes Blanches, the trekker crosses the Bettaforca Pass before arriving at Gressoney-La-Trinité. Then two passes must be crossed on the road to Macugnaga, the Col d'Olen and the Colle del Turlo. From Macugnaga the trekker reaches the Saastal by the Monte Moro Pass and goes around the Mischabelhörner before ending his journey in Zermatt. In total six passes between 2700 and 3300 metres must be crossed on a relatively difficult terrain.\n\nUsually these peaks are considered to be part of the Monte Rosa massif:\n\nUsually these glaciers are considered to be part of the Monte Rosa massif:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1814225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814225", "title": "Van Hool", "text": "Van Hool\n\nVan Hool NV () is a Belgian family-owned coachbuilder and manufacturer of buses, coaches, trolleybuses, and trailers.\n\nMost of the buses and coaches are built entirely by Van Hool, with engines and axles sourced from Caterpillar, Cummins, DAF and MAN and gearboxes from ZF or Voith. Some production involves building bus and coach bodies on separate bus chassis from manufacturers such as Volvo and Scania.\n\nWorldwide, Van Hool employs 4,500 people and manufactures more than 1,700 buses and coaches (bodyworks and complete vehicles combined) and 5,000 trailers each year. It sells an average of 600 coaches annually in the United States.\n\nThe company was founded in 1947 by Bernard van Hool in Koningshooikt, near Lier, Belgium. In the early years, the company introduced serial production and exported their products all over Europe. Since the mid-1980s, the company has also been active on the North American market.\n\nOn February 15, 1957, Van Hool signed a commercial agreement with Fiat; Van Hool would incorporate Fiat engines and other mechanical components (gearboxes, axles, steering) in its vehicles. It developed from a coachbuilder to a Belgian manufacturer of integral buses and coaches, known as Van Hool-Fiat. Alongside these activities, the company continued as a coachbuilder, enabling further expansion.\n\nIn August 1958, a year and a half after the agreement with Fiat was signed, the 100th Van Hool-Fiat was delivered, and by July 1961, the figure had exceeded 500. The co-operation agreement with Fiat was terminated in 1981.\n\nBetween 1974 and 1978 Van Hool and Dundalk-based coachbuilders Thomas McArdle entered into a partnership known as Van Hool McArdle to take over the bus building factory of CIÉ at Spa Road, Dublin, Ireland. The factory mainly built buses for CIÉ in Ireland plus some for export to the UK. The factory was then closed leaving the Republic of Ireland without a bus manufacturer for several years.\n\nIn 1990, Van Hool purchased the coachbuilding business of LAG Manufacturing and continued producing their EOS models for about ten years.\n\nIn Europe, Van Hool has a broad range of coaches, though all designs share similar looks and are based on the same platform, the TX. The same philosophy is used on the transit bus range, the A-series. In recent years, the company has been focusing on new propulsion technologies, introducing fuel-cell hybrid buses as well as diesel-electric hybrids.\n\nThe T8 platform was introduced in 1979. The body was based on the Alizee bodywork that had been launched the previous year. Over the course of several years, a range of touring coaches were developed based on this platform, each distinguished by a number and a name, following a clear naming convention. For example, in \"TD824 Astromega\":\nIn 1991, an updated \"T8 New Look\" was introduced, called the T9 in its North American version. Production was ended in the late 1990s, following the introduction of the new (European) T9 platform.\n\nIn the 1980s, European countries started to move away from standard bus designs, leaving the design of transit buses to the manufacturers. Van Hool's response was the development of the A-series transit buses. The first member, the A500, was introduced in 1985. A complete family would follow, again following a clear naming convention. For example, in 'AG500':\nProduction of the A-series continued into the early 21st century, when it was replaced by the newA-series.\n\nThe new T9 series in Europe was launched in 1995. It included a completely new body design and many other changes. The same philosophy as with the T8 was applied: one platform, many different versions. Also, the naming convention was retained. Over the years, many new variants have been developed. Different models (all available in at least 2 lengths, see 'products' below) include the Atlino and Atlon, with different floor heights, the Alicron, Acron and Astron, standard touring coaches with different heights and thus different luggage space, the Altano, which has an underfloor cockpit, the Astronef, which features a sloping theatre-style floor, and the double deck Astromega.\n\nAdditionally, the T9 body is also available on chassis by Scania, Volvo and VDL, though only in Sweden and the British Isles. These motorcoaches are referred to as Alizee (single deck) and Astrobel (double deck).\n\nAt Busworld 2011 in Kortrijk, Belgium, Van Hool presented the successor to the T9 series. The new series is called TX.\n\nIn 2001, Van Hool introduced the newA series transit buses, replacing the A series. It featured a new body design and many other changes. A complete family was developed, with different length and configurations.\n\nIn April 2011 Van Hool launched the ExquiCity platform, aimed specifically at the BRT market. The bus has the styling and comfort of a tram, with the flexibility and cost of a bus. The ExquiCity was launched in two lengths, the single-articulated ExquiCity 18 and the double-articulated ExquiCity 24. Both are available as trolley buses, diesel-electric hybrids, fuel-cell hybrids or full-electric buses. \n\nFirst orders were placed by the Italian city of Parma (ExquiCity 18 trolley) and the French city of Metz (ExquiCity 24 diesel electric hybrid). A mock-up was presented at the UITP Congress in Dubai. A fleet of ExquiCity 18s commenced service in Belfast, Northern Ireland on 3 September 2018 delivering the bus rapid transit service marketed under the name Glider.\n\nAt the \"Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung\" 2014 in Hanover, Germany, Van Hool presented the new EX series of touring coaches for the European market. It is produced in the Van Hool factory in Skopje, the capital of the Republic of Macedonia.\n\nDue to American federal safety requirements and other unique factors, only highway touring coaches were introduced in the United States initially, starting in 1987. Transit coaches by Van Hool were not introduced until 2002. Currently, Van Hool has four separate product lines: the TX series deluxe touring coaches, the CX series touring coaches, the TD925 and TDX double-decker coach, and the A-series transit buses. Van Hool's exclusive dealer in the United States is ABC Companies. \n\nIn 2018, Van Hool Headquarters announced plans to construct a new manufacturing facility in Morristown, Tennessee designed to produce public transit buses. The facility is planned to open in 2020, and employ 600 workers, capable of making approximately 400 buses annually. \n\nThe T815 was first introduced to the United States market in 1987. Later subsequent models are collectively known as the T8 series. The earliest use Cummins L10 diesels. Later versions use Cummins M11 diesels. It was available in length versions.\n\nT9 series are almost identical to the T8 series visually, and are largely identical mechanically as well, except for incremental updates. Later models in the T9 series have larger suspension airbags, as well as front disc brakes instead of drum brakes. Van Hool's VIN consider T8 and T9 to be the same family. It was available as T940 or extended T945 versions.\n\nIntroduced in 1995 and based on the European T9 platform, the T21 series features an updated design and more engine choices. Whereas the T8 and T9 series are almost exclusively powered by Cummins diesel engines, the T21 series is available with Cummins M11 plus, Detroit Diesel Series 60, or Caterpillar C13 ACERT engines. Later models of the T21 simplified the windshield into two panes only, replaced headlight assemblies with individual projector lamps, and consolidated the driver console. It is available as T2140 or extended T2145 versions.\n\nIntroduced as a lower-cost coach for long-distance routes, the C20 series, styled similarly to the T21 series, was introduced in 2000 to the United States market. C20 is available with Cummins ISX12 or Detroit Diesel DD13 engines. Previous generations could also be equipped with Cummins M11 plus, Cummins ISM, Detroit Diesel series 60 and Caterpillar C13 engines. Both Allison B500 automatic and ZF AS Tronic automated gearboxes are available. Available as extended C2045 version only. Current model is C2045E.\n\nGreyhound operates a fleet of C2045s along with its MCI buses in Michigan.\n\nVan Hool and ABC partnered with AC Transit (Alameda and Contra Costa counties, California) to demonstrate the A3 series as a future transit alternative in 2002. The AG300 is an articulated bus, while the A330 is a bus. The A330 and AG300 low floor transit coaches formally entered service in AC Transit's fleet in June 2003. AC Transit has over 290 Van Hool buses either in its fleet or on order as of August 2016.\n\nVan Hool was building 16 hydrogen fuel cell buses for the United States . These buses are powered by fuel cells from UTC Power and lithium batteries from EnerDell. Twelve of the buses are being purchased by AC Transit and four by CT Transit of Hartford, Connecticut. This project is unusual in that the buses have been designed from the ground up as fuel cell buses and are designed, built, and integrated by a single manufacturer.\n\nIn 2008, AC Transit took delivery of a fleet of new model A300L buses. These buses are unique in the United States market, as they have their engines mounted between the front and rear axles in an attempt to improve the ride quality. This bus is a longer version of the previously-introduced A300K (K stands for \"kort\", \"short\" in Dutch and L for \"lang\", \"long\"). A survey of AC Transit riders found that they approved of the design and quality of the new buses.\n\nUtah Transit Authority (based in Salt Lake City) purchased ten A300L buses in 2008, followed by four more in 2009, for its MAX Bus Rapid Transit system. These buses differ from AC Transit's A300Ls as they have three doors and are equipped for cold weather and high altitude operations.\n\nYork Region Transit (north of Toronto, Ontario) uses the A330 and AG300 buses on its Viva routes, though the A330 buses are being transferred to the conventional YRT service as more Nova LFX buses arrive for the Viva services. The Reseau de transport de Longueuil (south of Montreal, Quebec) also uses the AG300 buses, and was the first to use Van Hool transit buses in North America (AG700) in 1989.\n\nWashington, D.C.'s Circulator uses the A330 buses. These 29 buses were purchased from AC Transit in 2005. In addition to the A330 models, the Circulator now uses the new A300K buses, which first went into service in April 2009. The Circulator recently took delivery of 14 A300K, buses to build out its route structure. The A300K was chosen because of its ability to do the work of buses for nearly all operations with the smaller body and engine of a midi bus.\n\nFirstTransit took delivery of 12 A300Ls and 4 AG300s in early 2009, for use on the University of Minnesota Campus Connector.\n\nBaltimore, Maryland's Charm City Circulator have recently ordered and since put 5 A300Ls into service early 2011. The A300L was a supplement order to their already existing, but rehabilitating Designline buses.\n\nThe TD925 Astromega is a closed-top double-decker motor coach meeting United States specifications. It is a variant of the TD925 Astromega coach available in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Yanshengdao (言圣道 \"Way of the Holy Word\") is a branch of Shengdao.\n\nIt was founded at the start of the 20th century by Peng Tairong (1873-1950), styled \"Ruzun\", in Sichuan. The sect attracted the local gentry and in 1910 it was introduced to the Qing court. In 1917 the Tongshanshe was established in Beijing with the sponsorship of Duan Qirui (1865-1936) and general Cao Kun (1862-1938), later to become president of the Republic of China in 1923-24.\n\nThe Ministry of the Interior supported the establishment of a Tongshanshe branch in every province, municipality and county of China. By the early 1920s, Shengdao had a national membership of over 1 million. In 1920 a second administrative centre, the \"Unity Church\" (合一会 \"Héyī Huì\") was established in Hankou, which was to relieve the Beijing headquarters of some of its responsibilities.\n\nTongshanshe's close alliance with reactionary political circles caused it to be viewed with some disfavour by the later republican government, and in 1927 it was proscribed. This only fitfully enforced prohibition did not lead to the sect's immediate demise, but it did put a stop to its previous phase of rapid expansion. It was effectively suppressed only after the communist rise to power in 1949. Today, Shengdao \"halls of enlightenment\" (佛堂 \"fótáng\") remain operational in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Shengdao is still proscribed in the People's Republic of China, but nonetheless it is active as an underground church.\n\nAfter the loss of its mainland headquarters, there currently appears to be no central governing body that would embrace all Shengdao local churches. However, the situation is far from clear, as no extended study has been made of the sect's present state of affairs. There do seem to exist regional hierarchies in which one Shengdao church, often the oldest, claims seniority over the others, and acts as a sort of \"primus inter pares\".\n\nFor instance, the first Taiwanese enlightenment hall was founded in 1947 and in 1949 it created the \"Chinese Confucian Studies Association\" (中国孔学会 \"Zhōngguó Kǒngxué Huì\"). This earliest hall is designated as the \"provincial church\" (省会 \"shěnghuì\"), while its later offshoots in other parts of Taiwan are called \"branch bodies\" (分社 \"fēnshè\"). The picture is complicated by a schism that occurred in the Taiwanese section of the sect in 1978, leading to the establishment of a competing organization, the \"National Association of Godly Cultivation\" (国民修神协会 \"Guómín Xiūshén Xiéhuì\").\n\nIn Singapore is based the \"Southeast Asian General Church of Shengism\" (南洋圣教总会 \"Nányáng Shèngjiào Zǒnghuì\"), which is the head of the Shengdao local churches in Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nRituals, sitting meditation, and inner alchemy directly based on orthodox Taoist \"neidan\" are part of Shengdao practice and were widely disseminated among the general population in the 1920s. The Shengdao press house in Beijing, the \"Tianhuaguan\", published self-cultivation and morality books. The Tongshanshe engaged in charitable work and ran schools of traditional learning (\"guoxue\") and foreign languages courses.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1814231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814231", "title": "Iki (aesthetics)", "text": "Iki (aesthetics)\n\nIki (いき, English: roughly \"chic, stylish\") is a concept in aesthetics, the basis of which is thought to have formed among urbane commoners (chōnin) in Edo in the Tokugawa period. \"Iki\" is sometimes misunderstood as simply \"anything Japanese\" overseas, but it is actually a specific aesthetic ideal, distinct from more ethereal notions of transcendence or poverty. As such, samurai, for example, would typically, as a class, be considered devoid of \"iki\" (see \"yabo\"). At the same time, individual warriors are often depicted in contemporary popular imagination as embodying the \"iki\" ideals of a clear, stylish manner and blunt, unwavering directness. The term became widespread in modern intellectual circles through the book \"The Structure of Iki\" (1930) by Kuki Shūzō.\n\n\"Iki\", having emerged from the worldly Japanese merchant class, may appear in some ways a more contemporary expression of Japanese aesthetics than concepts such as \"wabi-sabi\". The term is commonly used in conversation and writing, but is not necessarily exclusive of other categories of beauty.\n\n\"Iki\" is an expression of simplicity, sophistication, spontaneity, and originality. It is ephemeral, romantic, straightforward, measured, audacious, smart, and lacking in detrimental self-consciousness.\n\n\"Iki\" is not overly refined, pretentious, complicated, showy, slick, coquettish, or, generally, cute. At the same time, \"iki\" may exhibit any of those traits in a smart, direct, and unabashed manner.\n\n\"Iki\" may signify a personal trait, or artificial phenomena exhibiting human will or consciousness. \"Iki\" is not used to describe natural phenomena, but may be expressed in human appreciation of natural beauty, or in the nature of human beings. Murakami Haruki (b. 1949), who writes in a clear, unflinching style—at turns sentimental, fantastic, and surreal—is described as embodying \"iki\". In contrast, Kawabata Yasunari (1899-1972) writes in a more poetic vein, with a closer focus on the interior \"complex\" of his characters, while situations and surroundings exhibit a kind of \"wabi-sabi\". That said, stylistic differences may tend to distract from a similar emotional subjectivity. Indeed, \"iki\" is strongly tied to stylistic tendencies.\n\nThe indefinite ideal of tsū (通) can be said to reference a highly cultivated but not necessarily solemn sensibility. The \"iki\"/\"tsu\" sensibility resists being construed within the context of overly specific rules about what could be considered as vulgar or uncouth.\n\n\"Iki\" and \"tsu\" are considered synonymous in some situations, but \"tsu\" exclusively refers to persons, while \"iki\" can also refer to situations/objects. In both ideals, the property of refinement is not academic in nature. \"Tsu\" sometimes involves excessive obsession and cultural (but not academic) pedantry, and in this case, it differs from \"iki\", which will not be obsessive. \"Tsu\" is used, for example, for knowing how to properly appreciate (eat) Japanese cuisines (sushi, tempura, soba etc.). \"Tsu\" (and some \"iki\"-style) can be transferred from person to person in form of \"tips.\" As \"tsu\" is more focused in knowledge, it may be considered superficial from \"iki\" point of view, since \"iki\" cannot be easily attained by learning.\n\n\"Yabo\" (野暮) is the antonym of \"iki\". \"Busui\" (無粋), literally \"non-\"iki\",\" is synonymous to \"yabo\".\n\nIn the Kamigata or Kansai area, the ideal of \"sui\" is prevalent. \"Sui\" is also represented by the kanji \"粋\". The sense of \"sui\" is similar to \"iki\" but not identical, reflecting various regional differences. The contexts of their usages are also different.\n\n\n"}

This school was located east of Main Street near Chief Peguis Trail. In 1871 the school was formally established as Manitoba College, a religious school affiliated with the Presbyterian Church. Instructors Rev. George Bryce and Thomas Hart taught a variety of subjects including sciences, modern languages, Latin and Greek.\n\nManitoba College was moved to Winnipeg in 1874, but it remained a small and financially insecure institution, depending of subsidies from the Presbyterian church organizations in eastern Canada.\n\nIn 1877, Manitoba College collaborated with two church colleges, St. Boniface College Roman Catholic and St John's Anglican, to form the University of Manitoba, a degree-granting organization that set educational standards for all three schools. Unlike these two colleges, Manitoba College's student body included some who were not studying theological subjects; the new university expanded this secular side and offered courses towards a Bachelor of Arts degree. In 1882, Manitoba College opened a new building on Ellice Avenue.\n\nIn 1913, Manitoba College and Wesley College attempted to partner as the \"United Colleges\". This experimentation ended in 1914 and the colleges reverted to their independence. Manitoba College discontinued its instruction in the Arts though it continued to operate as a college within the University of Manitoba. In the 1900s, the college briefly held missionary training courses for members of the Independent Greek Church. From 1920 to 1939 it offered a program for women studying to be deaconesses. In 1925, it became affiliated with the United Church.\n\nIn 1931, Manitoba College sold its property to St. John's College. It continued operations and taught Theology in rental space at St. John's and Wesley College.\n\nIn 1938, Manitoba College merged with Wesley College to form \"United College.\"\n\nIn 1967, United College received its charter and became the University of Winnipeg. Wilfred Lockhart became the University of Winnipeg's first president and served from 1967 and 1971.\n\nIn 2017, the University of Winnipeg celebrated its 50th anniversary.\n"}

It is a part of the University of Arkansas administrative system and a member of the NCSSSMST. The school was originally known as The Arkansas School for Mathematics and Sciences (abbreviated ASMS). The school is accredited by AdvancED.\n\nAcademically, the school is modeled after the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics. Studies focus on mathematics, computer science, science, and humanities. All courses are taught at the Honors level or above. ASMSA offers approximately 50 courses for university credit through a partnership with the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith as well as other advanced high school courses for elective credit. ASMSA graduates finish their two-year experience having earned an average of 50 college credit hours. ASMSA has an arts program, which was added in 2004 by the state legislature. Though not yet at the depth of the school's STEM-based programs, investment has been made in recent years to enhance experiences in studio and digital arts. Since 2015, the school has added three full-time faculty members in studio art and music to achieve this goal.\n\nThe school was created in 1991 with backing from then-Governor Bill Clinton. The charter class enrolled as juniors in 1993 and graduated in 1995.\n\nProspective students apply during the spring of their sophomore or freshman year and submit application forms, grade transcripts, SAT or ACT results, and three letters of recommendation. Students can enter via normal admissions as a junior, or they can enter through early admissions as a sophomore. Additionally, some students will repeat their junior year of high school at ASMSA because they didn't apply in time to be admitted with their regular class.\n\nStudents who attend ASMSA spend their time in a dormitory away from their homes. The dormitory is not co-ed, and there is no co-mingling outside of the two designated and approved co-ed mingling areas. The students are supervised by full-time Residential Mentors. Most of the campus of the school itself is located in the former St. Joseph's Catholic Hospital in the William Jefferson Clinton Presidential Park in the historic district of Hot Springs, and it is surrounded on three sides by the Hot Springs National Park.\n\nAll faculty have at least a master's degree in their field, and 48% have a Ph.D. or other terminal degree in their field. Notable professors at the school have included Dr. Don Baker, who was a Foreign Service Officer for the United States Department of State; Mrs. Melanie Nichols, who has served on several AP committees and has been active in the math education community, was a mathematics teacher at the school before becoming Dean of Academic Affairs in 2006; Dr. Brian Monson, who has previously taught at the University of Tulsa and the Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics, is chair of the science department and teaches AP Physics C, Optics, and Folk Music and Acoustics, and plays the harmonica and the mandolin; and Charlie Cole Chaffin, who was a chemistry teacher at the school, was a member of the Arkansas State Senate.\n\nSeveral former and current teachers at the school also instruct during the summer at the Arkansas Governor's School. The current Director of the school is Corey Alderdice.\n\nA new building called the Creativity and Innovation Complex was constructed and added to the campus in 2019. The first floor will be named the Dan Fredinburg Technology Center in memory of ASMSA Class of 1999 alumnus Dan Fredinburg.\n\nASMSA students have a number of projects and activities that completely fill their time. One of the school's trademarks is Capstone (used to be called FIRM), a longitudinal research project which culminates in the school's participation in the Intel Science and Engineering Fair, Senior Research Symposium or Arts Capstone, depending on the project. Students select a research topic at the start of their spring semester as a junior and will continue to research this project for the next fourteen months through a class titled Fundamentals in Research Methods. This project ends during Science Fair week, which is generally in late February. ASMSA competes as its own region in the state competition because of the quantity of projects it produces every year -- often a hundred or more. Projects sometimes culminate with substantial monetary awards, governmental recognition, as well as publication in local, statewide, regional, and nationwide news outlets.\n\nStudent involvement at ASMSA is present and there are a plethora of clubs, associations, and groups. The cultural awareness ADAPT Club shares and discusses different heritages, often with cultural foods, games, movies, stories, and music for the members as well as the general student body to enjoy, accept, and appreciate. There is also the SGA (Student Government Association) for those students exhibiting leadership in the school environment and policy. Other clubs, associations, and groups include: the Dolphin Dance Team, Model UN, Beta, Delta, National Honor Society, FBLA, Youth Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Science, Technology, Medicine, Music, and Liberal Arts (NAASTMML), SLAMT Sports Alliance, Community Leaders (CLs), Student Ambassadors, and many more.\n\n"}

It is native to Africa, Asia and Europe and is commonly used throughout the United States and Canada for erosion control, roadside planting and soil rehabilitation. It has become an invasive species in many states of the US.\n\nCrownvetch grows 1 to 2 feet tall and bears small clusters of 1/2-inch pink and white flowers from early summer to late fall. The variety Penngift produces mounds of pink flowers. Crownvetch is a tough, aggressive spreading plant that will crowd out its neighbors in a show garden but is well suited to a sunny bank, where it will grow for decades with little to no fertilizing, mowing, or weeding since the thick foliage prevents weeds from growing amid it. Its deep, tenacious, complex root system and thick, fern-like leaves provide excellent erosion control where it is used as a ground cover. However, this legume has a very long germination period of about 6 months and does not create full coverage until two or three years later.\n\nCrownvetch is toxic to horses and other non-ruminants because of the presence of nitroglycosides. If consumed in large amounts, it can cause slow growth, paralysis, or even death. However, this is not true for ruminant animals such as cattle, goats, and sheep. These aliphatic nitro compounds are degraded in ruminant digestion and do not affect the animals.\n\nCrownvetch was originally labeled as a poor forage for farm animals but more recently it has been deemed as a good forage when fed as hay to or grazed by ruminants. It consists of 21.7% crude protein and 22.2% crude fibre. In an experiment involving the digestibility of crownvetch in sheep, it was found that the crude protein is 65.6% and the crude fibre is 46.2% digestible which is similar, but slightly less than the digestibility of alfalfa forage. As previously mentioned, this only applies to ruminant animals as it is toxic to non-ruminants.\n\nCrownvetch has been identified as an invasive in several midwestern states. It is very hard to eradicate once established.\n\nIt is also a common host-plant for the moth \"Zygaena ephialtes.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1814280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814280", "title": "Pro Archia Poeta", "text": "Pro Archia Poeta\n\nCicero's oration Pro Archia Poeta is the published literary form of his defense of Aulus Licinius Archias, a poet accused of not being a Roman citizen. The accusation is believed to have been a political move against Lucullus through Archias. The poet was originally Greek but had been living in Rome for an extended period of time. A letter from Cicero to Titus Pomponius Atticus in the year following the trial makes mention of Archias, but there is no conclusive evidence about the outcome of the trial. The oration was rediscovered in Liège by Petrarch in 1333.\n\nLicinius Archias was born in Antioch around 120 BC and arrived in Rome in 102 BC. It was here that he earned a living as a poet and gained the patronage of the Roman general and politician L. Lucullus. Archias wrote poems of the general's military exploits, and in 93 BC, Lucullus helped him gain citizenship of the municipium of Heraclea. Thereafter, Archias was set up with a permanent residence in Rome in preparation for achieving full Roman citizenship. It was in Rome where Archias became a mentor and teacher of Cicero in his early education in rhetoric.\n\nArchias had become eligible for Roman citizenship under the \"Lex Iulia de Civitate Latinis Danda\", passed in 90 BC, and the \"Lex Plautia Papiria de Civitate Sociis Danda\", passed in 89 BC. The \"Lex Iulia\" granted Roman citizenship to all citizens of municipia on the Italic peninsula, provided they had not fought against Rome in the Social War.\n\nIn 65 BC, the Roman Senate passed the \"Lex Papia de Peregrinis\", which challenged false claims of citizenship and expelled foreigners from Rome. It is most likely under this law that Archias was prosecuted. Cicero came to his former teacher's defense at his trial in 62 BC, only months after delivering the famous Catiline Orations.\n\nThe prosecution laid out four accusations in its case against Archias:\n\nCicero argued in defense:\n\nBecause of Archias' close association with Lucullus, the case was probably a political attack directed at the politician by one of his many enemies. Chief among his enemies, and one who would stand to gain much by disgracing Lucullus was Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, better known as Pompey the Great.\n\nCicero divided the speech by following the formal structure of the dispositio:\n\n\nCicero begins his speech by gaining the goodwill or \"benevolentia\" of the judges. He starts with his trademark periodic sentence by depicting his strengths of natural talent, experience, and strategy while appearing humble and inferior to the qualities of his client. He asks the court to indulge him with a \"novum genus dicendi\" \"new manner of speaking\", similar to the style of a poet. The greater part of the speech contains finely crafted rhetoric and an increased frequency of such poetical devices as hendiadys, chiasmus, and the golden line. His aim is to draw attention to Archias' profession and appeal to his value in Roman culture. He reveals this thesis in lines 20–22:\n\nHe continues with this approach in the final lines of this section where he proposes that even if Archias were not enrolled as a citizen, his virtuous qualities should compel us to enroll him.\n\nCicero begins his account of Archias' life and travels through Asia and Greece during the poet's early career before his first arrival in Rome. He says that he was yet only sixteen or seventeen years old, wearing the striped toga or \"praetextatus\", when he began his studies in the arts and gained the attention of some of Rome's most influential citizens. Cicero emphasizes the stature of those who gave patronage to Archias by altering the usual word order.\n\nInstead of beginning with \"cum\" (\"since\") as what would be expected, Cicero suspends it to the end of the phrase to bring attention to the gravity of the names he states.\n\nWhile naming the law under which Archias was granted citizenship at Heraclea, Cicero begins with the verb to emphasize that citizenship was indeed granted (\"Data est\").\n\nIn this section, Cicero discredits the four points raised against his client. He uses dramatic rhetoric to discredit the case of his opponent, Grattius, whom he here names. He starts with two chiastic structures identifying his witnesses, Lucius Lucullus and the embassy, and then ridicules the prosecution with a tricolon crescendo.\n\nAfter the rebuttal Cicero presents his case for Archias’ citizenship. He starts the \"confirmatio\" by asking himself a question on behalf of Grattius.\n\"Quaeres a nobis, Grati, cur tanto opere hoc homine delectemur.\" (Cic. Arch. 12)\n\n“You will ask me, Gratius, why I am so enthusiastic about this man.”In his argument, Cicero discusses the benefits of literature, the intrinsic dignity or virtue of poets and the relationship of the poet to the state. Cicero mentions three benefits of literature: literature provides refreshment for the spirit and repose for the senses; it provides Cicero with inspiration for his daily speeches and therefore strengthens his oratorical powers; and it contains moral lessons and provides examples to contemplate and to emulate.\nCicero states that poets have a natural gift and that Ennius called poets holy. Literature tells and celebrates achievements. It is for that reason that many noble Romans had a poet to write for them.\nIn the end of the \"confirmatio\" Cicero gives another reason for his passion for Archias: \n\"Nam quas res nos in consulatu nostro vobiscum simul pro salute huius urbis atque imperii et pro vita civium proque universa re publica gessimus, attigit hic versibus atque inchoavit: quibus auditis, quod mihi magna res et iucunda visa est, hunc ad perficiendum adhortatus sum.\" (Cic. Arch. 28) \n\n“The measures which I, jointly with you, undertook in my consulship for the safety of the empire, the lives of our citizens, and the common weal of the state, have been taken by my client as the subject of a poem which he has begun; he read this to me, and the work struck me as at once so forcible and so interesting, that I encouraged him to complete it.” (Watts translation)Apparently Archias was writing a poem about Cicero's consulship, and Cicero was eager for him to complete it.\nCicero makes a final emotional appeal to the jury. Just as in the \"exordium\" he makes clear that this was an unusual speech compared to the tradition of trials. He is however certain the judges have received it gladly: \"... quae a foro aliena iudicialique consuetudine et de hominis ingenio et communiter de ipsius studio locutus sum, ea, iudices, a vobis spero esse in bonam partem accepta, ab eo, qui iudicium exercet, certo scio.\" (Cic. Arch. 32)\n\n“I hope that my departure from the practice and the conventions of the courts, and my digression upon the subject of my client’s genius, and, in general terms, upon the art which he follows, has been welcomed by you in as generous a spirit as I am assured it has been welcomed by him who presides over this tribunal.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Caucasian people with a variant allele of the ITPA gene, experience higher rates of febrile neuropenia than people of other ethnic groups, due to differences in allelic frequencies among ethnicities.\n\nMercaptopurine can lower the body's ability to fight off infection. Those taking it should get permission from a doctor to receive immunizations and vaccinations. It is also recommended that, while on the drug, one should avoid those having recently received oral polio vaccine.\n\nThis drug was formerly not recommended during pregnancy and early evidence indicated pregnant women on the drug (or the related azathioprine) showed a seven-fold incidence of fetal abnormalities as well as a 20-fold increase in miscarriage. There were also anecdotal reports linking mercaptopurine with spontaneous abortion, leading to the US FDA rating both AZA and mercaptopurine as category D drugs. However, Davis et al. 1999 found mercaptopurine, compared to methotrexate, was ineffective as a single-agent abortifacient; every woman in the mercaptopurine arm of the study had fetal cardiac activity at follow-up (two weeks later) and was given a suction abortion. A more recent, larger study, however, performed by the Cancers et Surrisque Associe aux Maladies inflamatoires intestinales En France (CESAME) indicated an overall rate of congenital malformations not significantly greater than the general population in France. The European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) concluded in a consensus paper in 2010 that while AZA and mercaptopurine have an FDA rating of D, new research in both animals and humans indicates that \"thiopurines are safe and well tolerated during pregnancy.\"\n\nMercaptopurine causes changes to chromosomes in animals and humans, though a study in 1990 found, \"while the carcinogenic potential of 6-MP cannot be precluded, it can be only very weak or marginal.\" Another study in 1999 noted an increased risk of developing leukemia when taking large doses of 6-MP with other cytotoxic drugs.\n\nAllopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that breaks down mercaptopurine. Those taking allopurinol (often used to prevent gout) are at risk for mercaptopurine toxicity. The dose should be reduced or allopurinol should be discontinued.\nSeveral published studies have demonstrated that the use of allopurinol in combination with low dose 6-MP helps reduce 6-MP levels, which are toxic to liver tissue, whilst increasing the therapeutic levels of 6-MP for some inflammatory conditions.\n\nOfficial information from the package insert for purinethol:\n\n6-MP ribonucleotide inhibits purine nucleotide synthesis and metabolism by inhibiting an enzyme called phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PRPP amidotransferase). Since this enzyme is the rate limiting factor for purine synthesis, this alters the synthesis and function of RNA and DNA. Mercaptopurine interferes with nucleotide interconversion and glycoprotein synthesis.\n\nThe enzyme thiopurine \"S\"-methyltransferase (TPMT) is responsible, in part, for the inactivation of 6-mercaptopurine. TPMT catalyzes the methylation of 6-mercaptopurine into the inactive metabolite 6-methylmercaptopurine – this methylation prevents mercaptopurine from further conversion into active, cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) metabolites. Certain genetic variations within the TPMT gene can lead to decreased or absent TPMT enzyme activity, and individuals who are homozygous or heterozygous for these types of genetic variations may have increased levels of TGN metabolites and an increased risk of severe bone marrow suppression (myelosuppression) when receiving mercaptopurine. In many ethnicities, \"TPMT\" polymorphisms that result in decreased or absent TPMT activity occur with a frequency of approximately 5%, meaning that about 0.25% of people are homozygous for these variants. However, an assay of TPMT activity in red blood cells or a TPMT genetic test can identify people with reduced TPMT activity, allowing for the adjustment of mercaptopurine dose or avoidance of the drug entirely. The FDA-approved drug label for mercaptopurine recommends testing for TPMT activity to identify people at risk for myelotoxicity. Testing for TPMT activity is an example of pharmacogenetics being translated into routine clinical care.\n\n6-MP was discovered by Nobel Prize winning scientists Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings at Burroughs Wellcome in Tuckahoe, New York, and was clinically developed in collaboration with investigators at Memorial Hospital (now Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City). The collaboration was initiated by Cornelius P. Rhoads who had run chemical weapons programs for the US army and had been involved in the work that led to the discovery that nitrogen mustards could potentially be used as cancer drugs, and had become the director of Memorial in 1948.\n\n"}

He was credited for leading the successful public housing program in the Southeast Asian city-state during the early 1960s, which eased the acute housing shortage problem at that time.\n\nBorn in 1916 in Singapore, Lim was the eldest of six children. He was educated at Oldham Hall School, Anglo-Chinese School, and then Raffles College, where he obtained a Diploma in Arts (Economics) in 1939..\n\nWhen World War II erupted and the Japanese occupied Singapore, Lim was one of many tortured on suspicion of being pro-communist and pro-British. A long time after the war, Lim said that those who survived the horror and the brutality of the Japanese occupation \"will never forget them.\" Mr Lim also said that the experience, while traumatic and humiliating, politicized his generation and made them vow to \"never let our fate be decided by others.\"\n\nLim made his first million at age 36 when he came up with a machine to produce sago pearls cheaply.\n\nIn 1958, Lim was appointed to the Public Service Commission and the Housing Board. Lim served as a Member of Parliament in Cairnhill from 1963 to 1980.\n\nIn 1960, Lim was appointed the first Chairman of the Housing Development Board. Due to a rapidly increasing population, more than 400,000 people were living in over-crowded conditions in ramshackle “shophouse” buildings or in squatter settlements with substandard living conditions. At this time, Lim was appointed to the Housing Development Board.\n\nHe had volunteered for the job and had not been paid for three years. It was in this position that Lim oversaw the massive construction of high-rise, low-cost apartments that would eventually become the main source of housing for Singaporeans.\n\nLim was known for his organizing and planning abilities. He forwent a detailed planning stage and instead chose a \"rough and ready\" approach to work fast using rough estimates of the housing requirement. In the first two year of this crash program, over 2000 units were built, more than what was built in the previous decade.\n\nLim defied all detractors, in particular those in the Singapore Improvement Trust, who said he could not build 10,000 units a year. A committee was eventually set up under Lim Tay Boh () to find out whether the HDB had the capability and the materials to reach the construction goal. By the time the committee published its report, the HDB had already completed 10,000 units of housing.\n\nIn the first Five Year Housing Program, HDB achieved its goal of completing 5,000 units of housing by 1965. The largest project at that time was Queenstown, a satellite town of more than 17,500 apartments capable of housing close to 22,000 people. The new neighborhood was built as a self-contained entity, with all amenities and shops built along with the houses, so people would not need to travel to other areas for basic necessities, thereby lowering traffic congestion. This philosophy (which was ultimately extended with the concept of regional centre), is generally accredited by many to have significantly contributed to the lower rate of congestion and burden on the central business district than before.\n\nIn May 1961, the Bukit Ho Swee Fire broke out and some 16,000 people became homeless. Under Lim's guidance, the relocation and reconstruction of the lost housing was completed in just over four years, and 1200 housing flats were made available to those who lost their homes in the fire.\n\nThe success of the housing project was considered by some to stem mainly from the standardized architectural designs that were used. Another important factor was Lim's decision to use private contractors rather than employing construction workers directly. This allowed the HDB to supervise the contractors to ensure standards, rather than dealing with minute problems. Also, overall cost was kept low by using a large pool of contractors and different sources of building materials.\n\nThere are some who said that by solving Singapore's housing problem, Lim saved the PAP in the process. However, Lim himself was more modest, saying the success of the housing programme was also due to government funding, as housing was, and still is, a top priority.\n\nPart of Lim's success at the HDB was that he had the trust of the Prime Minister at the time, Lee Kuan Yew. He also worked closely with the Minister of Finance at the time, Goh Keng Swee. These connections allowed Lim keep the housing program well-funded. Another political factor that allowed the success of the Housing Project was that Lim managed to cut through bureaucratic red tape and rigid regulations that would have otherwise hindered the housing program.\n\nIn June 1962, Lim was awarded the State's highest honor, the Darjah Utama Temasek (Order of Temasek) and the Ramon Magsaysay Award for his community leadership, which provided a model for the developing world.\n\nIn September 1963, Lim stood for election in the Singapore Legislative Assembly election as a PAP candidate from the Cairnhill constituency. Lim won by a landslide, winning 7,749 votes out of the 11,659 cast. In October, Lim was appointed as Minister for National Development. Also, in recognition of Lim's adept ability of judging a person's merits, he was also brought on board as the PAP's \"talent scout.\"\n\nAfter Singapore's independence in 1965, Lim served as Minister of Finance for 2 years, before becoming the Minister of Interior and Defence. He held this position for three years until 1970, when Lim was appointed as Chairman of the Public Utilities Board to oversee the development of new water reservoirs. He would hold the chairmanship from 1971 to 1978. He therefore returned to the other posts, such as Minister for Environment (1972 - 1975/1979 - 1981), Minister for Communications (1975 - 1978) and Minister for National Development (1978 - 1979).\n\nLim quit politics in 1980 but remained active in public life well into the twilight years of his life. After a long illness, Lim died at approximately 5.30PM SST on 20 July 2006 at his home. He was cremated at Mandai. In recognition of Lim's work for the government, the Singaporean state flags on all government buildings were flown at half-mast on the day of his funeral.\n\nLim left behind five children, 12 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. England-born footballer Luke O'Nien is his grand-nephew. \n"}

{"id": "1814329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814329", "title": "Stir Crazy (film)", "text": "Stir Crazy (film)\n\nStir Crazy is a 1980 American comedy film directed by Sidney Poitier, produced by Hannah Weinstein and written by Bruce Jay Friedman. The film stars Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor as unemployed friends who are given 125-year prison sentences after being framed for a bank robbery. While in prison they befriend other prison inmates. The film reunited Wilder and Pryor, who had appeared previously in the 1976 comedy thriller film \"Silver Streak\". The film was released in the United States on December 12, 1980 to mixed critical reviews and was a major financial success.\n\nAspiring actor Harry Monroe (Pryor) is working as a waiter in a rich man's house, but is fired when the cooks accidentally use his stash of marijuana as oregano at a dinner party. His friend, playwright Skip Donahue (Wilder), is working as a shop detective when he thinks he sees a well-known actress shoplifting, and his accusation gets him fired. Skip, the optimist of the two, spins their shared unemployment positively and convinces Harry that they should travel to California. They leave New York City in a battered Dodge camper-van, taking odd jobs along the way. \n\nIn Arizona, Skip and Harry perform a song and dance routine dressed as woodpeckers as part of a promotion for a bank. While the duo are on break, two men steal the costumes and rob the bank. However, Harry and Skip are arrested and convicted of the crime, and handed 125-year jail sentences. Their court-appointed lawyer, Len Garber, advises them to wait until he can appeal their case.\n\nThe two are transferred to a maximum-security prison. After a failed attempt at faking insanity, they make friends with Jesus Ramirez, a bank robber, and Rory Schultebrand, a gay man who killed his stepfather. After three months, Skip and Harry are brought to see Warden Walter Beatty and Deputy Warden Wilson, the head guard, to perform a \"test\" on a mechanical bull. To everyone's surprise, Skip rides the bull at full power, so Beatty selects him to compete in the prison's annual rodeo competition.\n\nJesus and Rory inform Harry and Skip that the rodeo it is a crooked operation run by Beatty and Warden Henry Sampson, who heads the neighboring prison. The money from the rodeo, which is supposed to go to the prisoners, ends up in the wardens' pockets. Knowing Skip will be selected as the prison's new champion, Jesus and Rory hatch a plan for escape involving Skip refusing to participate until the warden provides concessions. They warn Skip that he will be tortured by the warden first, and he is, but Skip fakes a blasé attitude towards everything the guards throw at him, including a week in the \"hot box\" and forcing he and Harry to share a cell with hulking, seemingly-mute mass murderer Grossberger.\n\nHarry and Skip are visited by Garber, who introduces them to his law partner, his cousin Meredith, to whom Skip is immediately attracted. Later, Skip meets with Beatty to make a deal: In exchange for his participation in the rodeo, Skip requests his own crew (Harry, Jesus, Rory and Grossberger), along with a shared cell for the five of them. Beatty agrees, later ordering Wilson to have a guard watch them at all times. Wilson reveals to his prison snitch, former rodeo champion Jack Graham, that Skip will not leave the rodeo alive.\n\nWhile practicing for the rodeo, Skip, Harry, Jesus, Rory, and Grossberger acquire tools they need for their escape, while Meredith gets a job as a waitress in a country western strip club searching for possible suspects and encounters the real bank robbers. At the rodeo, each member of Skip's team but Grossberger escape through a secret path, taking them through air vents to be met by either Jesus' wife or brother. Once through, they put on their disguises and re-enter the grounds as audience members.\n\nSkip competes against rival champion Caesar Geronimo to swipe the prize: a bag of money from the horns of a large, Brahman bull. Skip suggests that they give the money to the prisoners, and offers to help Caesar win if he agrees to do so. Caesar wins, and throws the bag to the inmates, while Skip escapes and joins his friends.\n\nAt a secret meeting spot, Jesus and Rory bid Harry and Skip farewell as they leave for Mexico. Harry and Skip get in the other car, but are intercepted by Garber and Meredith. She tells Harry and Skip that the police have captured the real crooks, and Harry and Skip decide to resume their original plan of heading to Hollywood. Skip asks Meredith to go with him, and Meredith agrees.\n\nThe film was shot in Manhattan, New York; Burbank, California; St. George, Utah Florence and Tucson, Arizona in 56 days from February 15 to April 11, 1980.\n\n\"Stir Crazy\" has a 67% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 15 reviews. It was a box office success, setting a record opening week for Columbia Pictures of $12,972,131 and then setting a studio record $15,336,245 the following week, including a studio record single day gross of $3,237,279. It went on to gross $101,300,000, being the third-highest-grossing film of 1980, behind \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"9 to 5\". It was Columbia's third film to gross $100 million and third highest-grossing film of all time, after \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" and \"Kramer vs. Kramer\". The box office total marked the first time a film directed by an African-American earned more than $100 million.\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four and wrote that it \"starts strong,\" but \"once Wilder and Pryor are thrown into prison, it seems to lose its way,\" as \"the movie gets bogged down in developing its own plot. That is not always the best thing for a comedy to do, because if we're not laughing it hardly matters what happens to the plot.\" Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" panned the film as \"a prison comedy of quite stunning humorlessness\" which \"appears to have been improvised, badly, more often than written.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"Sidney Poitier has directed 'Stir Crazy' as if it were as much fun as his previous comedies—e.g., 'Uptown Saturday Night.' But no amount of bouncy good-naturedness can disguise the stretched-thin quality of the material.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" was positive, giving the film three stars out of four and writing, \"There are explosively funny moments in this prison comedy that wouldn't be there without Pryor, who radiates a comic energy in a scene even when he's merely standing still.\" \"Variety\" wrote, \"The extensive comic talents of Richard Pryor take a below average film like 'Stir Crazy' and make it into an often funny and saleable picture.\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" also liked the film, stating that it \"blends several inventive, high-spirited performing talents into a tangy, cheerful entertainment.\" David Ansen of \"Newsweek\" found the film \"only intermittently funny,\" remarking that writer Bruce Jay Friedman is \"trying for a formula film and can't land on the right formula. Is it a buddy movie, a caper comedy, a parody of prison films, an urban-cowboy neo-Western, a New York vs. Sun Belt comedy? Unfortunately it's more of a shambles than any of the above, albeit a fairly genial one.\"\n\nThe film was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress for Georg Stanford Brown in drag.\n\n\n"}

After their meeting in 1925 and until his death in 1936, Marta Abba was the stimulus to the playwright Luigi Pirandello's creativity. She was an aspiring young 25-year-old actress when she met the 58-year-old playwright, whose wife had been confined to a mental asylum in 1919. From their correspondence it comes out how she not only inspired him but she also gave the writer confidence in his work. Their relationship was complex but contributed much to the Italian theatre.\n\nPirandello was obsessive in pursuit of what could be presumed to have remained an unconsummated affair. Marta was the true great actress for whom he had been waiting after his earlier bitter disappointment with Eleonora Duse. Luigi Pirandello's and Marta Abba's letters to each other have been translated into English. Marta Abba and Pirandello teamed up in 1925, and she appeared in many of his productions at the \"Rome Arts Theater\". In 1930, Abba founded her own theatrical company and specialized in staging the works of Pirandello and other European playwrights like George Bernard Shaw, Gabriele d'Annunzio and Carlo Goldoni under the direction of prestigious directors like Max Reinhardt and Guido Salvini.\n\nHer Broadway theatre debut was in the play \"Tovarich\" at the Plymouth Theatre, (10/15/1936 - circa. 8/1937) in the role of Grand Duchess Tatiana Petrovna.

{"id": "1814356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814356", "title": "American Humane", "text": "American Humane\n\nAmerican Humane (AH) is an organization founded in 1877, committed to ensuring the safety, welfare and well-being of animals. American Humane's leadership programs are first to serve in promoting and nurturing the bonds between animals and humans. It was previously called the International Humane Association, before changing its name in 1878. In 1940, it became the sole monitoring body for the humane treatment of animals on the sets of Hollywood films and other broadcast productions. American Humane is best known for its trademarked certification \"No Animals Were Harmed\", which appears at the end of film or television credits where animals are featured in. It has also run the Red Star Animal Emergency Services since 1916. In 2000, American Humane formed the Farm Animal Services program, an animal welfare label system for food products. American Humane is currently headquartered in Washington, D.C. It is a section 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.\n\nAmerican Humane began on October 9, 1877, as \"The International Humane Association,\" with the amalgamation of 27 organizations from across the United States after a meeting at the Kennard House in Cleveland, Ohio. The invitation to the other groups came from the Illinois Humane Society, sent on September 15, 1877, to discuss the specific problem of farm animal maltreatment during their transport between the eastern and western US. Groups attending the meeting included associations from the State of New York, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maryland, Connecticut, and New Hampshire. A group from Minnesota also pledged its support to the forthcoming results of the conference, though they could not attend, and a group from the Canadian province of Quebec requested the a transcript proceedings be sent to them afterward. \n\nThe International Humane Association changed its name to the \"American Humane Association\" in November 1878. New member organizations were in attendance for their second annual general meeting, held in Baltimore, Maryland, also came from California, Massachusetts, Maine, Delaware, and the District of Columbia. Canadian regions were also included in the Association. From 1892-1900, Francis H. Rowley was Secretary of the American Humane Association. \n\nIn 1916, American Humane founded Red Star Rescue Relief after the U.S. Secretary of War asked American Humane to rescue injured horses on the battlefields of World War 1. Notable members of 1917 included President William O. Stillman and 2nd Vice-President Peter G. Gerry. There were 36 Vice-Presidents listed including William Howard Taft, Thomas R. Marshall and Francis H. Rowley.\n\nIn 1954, tensions within the ranks of American Humane members came to a head at the organization's annual meeting, as a member-nominated slate of board candidates stood for office in opposition to a board-nominated slate. The majority of those assembled at the Atlanta, Georgia, convention elected the three candidates on the member-nominated slate, J. Perry, Raymond Naramore, and Roland Smith. In the meeting's aftermath, there were firings and resignations on the part of staff members, including Larry Andrews, Marcia Glaser, Helen Jones, and Fred Myers. This core group went on to found a new organization, the National Humane Society, later known as The Humane Society of the United States, as an alternative to American Humane.\n\nAmerican Humane's first \"No Animals Were Harmed\" end credit was issued at the end of the movie \"The Doberman Gang\" in 1972.\n\nIn 1997, American Humane launched The Front Porch Project in order to prevent child abuse and neglect.\n\nAmerican Humane is a BBB accredited charity. American Humane also received a B+ rating from CharityWatch.\n\nAccording to \"The Gettysburg Times\", the \"American Humane Association began offering animal relief in August, 1916, by accepting an invitation of the War Department to help animals used by the U.S. Army during WWI. The invitation resulted in the development of the American Red Star Animal Relief Program known today as Red Star Rescue Relief. Since its inception, the American Humane Association's Red Star Animal Emergency Services has responded to national and international disasters, rescuing thousands of animals.\" Disasters where the group has rescued animals include the 2011 Joplin tornado, Hurricane Katrina, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Hurricane Sandy, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the September 11 attacks.\n\nToday, Red Star Rescue Relief includes a fleet of emergency response vehicles customized to help animals in disasters, as well as specialized rescue equipment designed specifically for animal search and rescue.\n\nRecently, Red Star Rescue Relief saved hundreds of shelter animals following an F-5 tornado in Oklahoma. In addition to natural disasters, Red Star Rescue Relief also recovers animals from dog-fighting rings, man-made disasters, and hazardous animal shelters.\n\nAmerican Humane has released several books and publications including:\n\nAmerican Humane began its work in film in 1940 after an incident that occurred on the set of the film \"Jesse James\". The group began protesting the public release of the film because of a scene in which a horse was forced to run off the edge of a cliff. The horse fell over 70 feet to the ground below and broke its spine, having to be put down afterwards. In 1966, American Humane's access to some sets was diminished for 14 years following the dismantling of the Hays Office, during which time their jurisdiction was lessened.\n\nBy contract with the Screen Actors Guild, American Humane monitors animal use on film sets. However, the Screen Actors Guild has no jurisdiction concerning non-American and non-union productions.\n\nIn 1980, following the release of \"Heaven's Gate\", the opening of which was met with a national picketing and protest effort after complaints about how the filming of the movie had involved the inhumane treatment of animals – including the deaths of five horses – the Screen Actors Guild negotiated for the universal presence of American Humane on the set as part of its union deal, forcing moviemakers to contact American Humane in advance of any animal being present on set.\n\nToday the American Humane Film and Television Unit specifically oversees animals used during media productions, and it is sanctioned by the Screen Actors Guild to oversee a production's humane care of animals. It is the only organization with jurisdiction to do so within the United States. Because of this, American Humane may choose to issue the end credit disclaimer \"No Animals Were Harmed\", with a piece of a filmstrip that depicts a dog, a horse and an elephant. American Humane also reports on animal safety during filming if public concerns arise or if animal accidents happen on the set. American Humane protects the animals on the set as well as the cast/crew members who interact with the animals. According to American Humane, they ensure that budgets and time constraints do not compromise the safety or care of the animals.\n\nAmerican Humane's standard of animal care is outlined in the Guidelines for the Safe Use of Animals in Filmed Media, which were established in 1988. It covers large animals, as well as fish, insects, birds, reptiles, and any other living creature. On the set, American Humane's Certified Animal Safety Representatives attempt to ensure the Guidelines are upheld. American Humane's oversight includes film, television, commercials, music videos, and Internet productions.\n\nIn the late 1980s, American Humane was accused by Bob Barker and the United Activists for Animal Rights of condoning animal cruelty on the set of \"Project X\" and in several other media projects. The basis of the accusation was the allowing of a cattle prod and a gun on set, and the rumored beating of the chimpanzee on set. American Humane responded by launching a $10 million suit for libel, slander and invasion of privacy against Barker. American Humane claimed that there had been a two-year \"vendetta\" against them behind the accusations. In a series of public advertisements along with the $10 million libel suit, American Humane stated that the allegations were made based on insufficient and misleading information. The suit was eventually settled by Barker's insurance company, which paid American Humane $300,000.\n\n\"Los Angeles Times\" reported, in 2001, that the American Humane Film Unit \"has been slow to criticize cases of animal mistreatment, yet quick to defend the big-budget studios it is supposed to police,\" and that an examination of American Humane \"also raises questions about the association's effectiveness.\" The article cites numerous cases of animals injured during filming which the American Humane may have overlooked.\n\nIn late 2013, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" ran a story which implicated American Humane in turning a blind eye to and underreporting incidents of animal abuse on television and movie sets. For example, during the filming of \"\", 27 animals died. Nevertheless, the movie received a \"no animals were harmed\" disclaimer. During the filming of the movie \"Life of Pi\", the tiger \"King\" nearly drowned in a pool, yet this incident was not reported outside of the American Humane organization.\n\nIn early 2017, CNN reported that American Humane's representative for the movie \"A Dog's Purpose\" failed to properly monitor and protect a dog used in the film. American Humane placed an employee on leave after a video was published showing the dog in distress while performing a stunt for the movie. A third-party report later found that the video was \"deliberately edited for the purpose of misleading the public and stoking public outrage.\"\n\nIn 2000, American Humane's Farm Animals Services program created the first farm animal welfare label to be overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The program began as \"Free Farmed\" under Adele Douglass, who left American Humane in 2003, to found Humane Farm Animal Care. American Humane's program is now called \"Humane Heartland.\"\n\nAmerican Humane certifies farms after evaluating them on a five-point criteria. The animals are expected to be free from hunger, discomfort, pain, and fear, and able to express normal behaviors. Farms that meet this criteria receive an American Humane Certified label.\n\nIn the past four years, the number of American Humane Certified animals has jumped more than 1,000%. Over 1 billion animals are now American Humane Certified. As of July 2012, it claimed to include 100 major producers, representing approximately 500 farms, and more than 135 million animals. The auditing is done by American Humane, with the USDA also auditing the certifications to ensure compliance. The label informs purchasers that American Humane has found that the animals were not subjected to unnecessary pain, distress, or fear while being raised. Part of what the program demands is the implementation of minimum space requirements per animal on a farm or in farming facilities. American Humane currently certifies approximately 90 percent of cage-free eggs sold in the U.S.\n\nIn 2013, Foster Farms earned the American Humane Certified designation from American Humane for its handling of poultry. In June 2015, Mercy for Animals released a video of an undercover investigation of several Foster Farms poultry facilities certified as \"humane\" by American Humane. The footage included workers treating the chickens violently and using inhumane slaughter methods; this resulted in Mercy for Animals calling American Humane's certification program \"a scam\".\n\nEach year a series of dogs are awarded the Hero Dog Awards, given to dogs that have contributed substantially to human society. There are several categories in which dogs can be nominated, including the Military Dog category. The grand prize for the American Hero Dog was $10,000, which is given to a charity that reflects the contributions of the animal. In 2011 and 2012 the awards were broadcast on the Hallmark Channel. The first winner of the national award was a dog named Roselle, who led his blind owner down from the 78th floor of the World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks.

{"id": "1814357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814357", "title": "Pixel-art scaling algorithms", "text": "Pixel-art scaling algorithms\n\nPixel-art scaling algorithms are graphical filters that are often used in video game console emulators to enhance hand-drawn 2D pixel art graphics. The re-scaling of pixel art is a specialist sub-field of image rescaling.\n\nAs pixel-art graphics are usually in very low resolutions, they rely on careful placing of individual pixels, often with a limited palette of colors. This results in graphics that rely on a high amount of stylized visual cues to define complex shapes with very little resolution, down to individual pixels. This makes image scaling of pixel art a particularly difficult problem.\n\nA number of specialized algorithms have been developed to handle pixel-art graphics, as the traditional scaling algorithms do not take such perceptual cues into account.\n\nSince a typical application of this technology is improving the appearance of fourth-generation and earlier video games on arcade and console emulators, many are designed to run in real time for sufficiently small input images at 60 frames per second. This places constraints on the type of programming techniques that can be used for this sort of real-time processing. Many work only on specific scale factors: 2× is the most common, with 3×, 4×, 5× and 6× also present.\n\nThe Mullard SAA5050 Teletext character generator chip (1980) used a primitive pixel scaling algorithm to generate higher-resolution characters on screen from a lower-resolution representation from its internal ROM. Internally each character shape was defined on a 5×9 pixel grid, which was then interpolated by smoothing diagonals to give a 10×18 pixel character, with a characteristically angular shape, surrounded to the top and to the left by two pixels of blank space. The algorithm only works on monochrome source data, and assumes the source pixels will be logical true or false depending on whether they are 'on' or 'off'. Pixels 'outside the grid pattern' are assumed to be off.\n\nThe algorithm works as follows:\n\nNote that this algorithm, like the Eagle algorithm below, has a flaw:\nIf a pattern of 4 pixels in a hollow diamond shape appears, the hollow will be obliterated by the expansion.\nThe SAA5050's internal character ROM carefully avoids ever using this pattern.\nEric's Pixel Expansion (EPX) is an algorithm developed by Eric Johnston at LucasArts around 1992, when porting the SCUMM engine games from the IBM PC (which ran at 320×200×256 colors) to the early color Macintosh computers, which ran at more or less double that resolution.\nThe algorithm works as follows, expanding P into 4 new pixels based on P's surroundings:\n\nLater implementations of this same algorithm (as AdvMAME2× and Scale2×, developed around 2001) have a slightly more efficient but functionally identical implementation:\n\nAdvMAME2× is available in DOSBox via the codice_1 dosbox.conf option.\n\nThe AdvMAME4×/Scale4× algorithm is just EPX applied twice to get 4× resolution.\n\nThe AdvMAME3×/Scale3× algorithm (available in DOSBox via the codice_2 dosbox.conf option) can be thought of as a generalization of EPX to the 3× case. The corner pixels are calculated identically to EPX.\n\nThere is also a variant improved over Scale3× called ScaleFX, developed by Sp00kyFox, and a version combined with Reverse-AA called ScaleFX-Hybrid.\n\nAssume an input matrix of 3×3 pixels where the center most pixel is the pixel to be scaled, and an output matrix of 2×2 pixels (i.e., the scaled pixel)\n\nThus if we have a single black pixel on a white background it will vanish. This is a bug in the Eagle algorithm, but is solved by other algorithms such as EPX, 2xSaI and HQ2x.\n\n2×SaI, short for 2× Scale and Interpolation engine, was inspired by Eagle. It was designed by Derek Liauw Kie Fa, also known as Kreed, primarily for use in console and computer emulators, and it has remained fairly popular in this niche. Many of the most popular emulators, including ZSNES and VisualBoyAdvance, offer this scaling algorithm as a feature.\n\nSince Kreed released the source code under the GNU General Public License, it is freely available to anyone wishing to utilize it in a project released under that license. Developers wishing to use it in a non-GPL project would be required to rewrite the algorithm without using any of Kreed's existing code.\n\nIt is available in DosBox via codice_3 option.\n\nSeveral slightly different versions of the scaling algorithm are available, and these are often referred to as \"Super 2×SaI\" and \"Super Eagle\".\n\nMaxim Stepin's hq2x, hq3x, and hq4x are for scale factors of 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1 respectively. Each works by comparing the color value of each pixel to those of its eight immediate neighbours, marking the neighbours as close or distant, and using a pregenerated lookup table to find the proper proportion of input pixels' values for each of the 4, 9 or 16 corresponding output pixels. The hq3x family will perfectly smooth any diagonal line whose slope is ±0.5, ±1, or ±2 and which is not anti-aliased in the input; one with any other slope will alternate between two slopes in the output. It will also smooth very tight curves. Unlike 2xSaI, it anti-aliases the output.\n\nhq\"n\"x was initially created for the Super Nintendo emulator ZSNES. The author of bsnes has released a space-efficient implementation of hq2x to the public domain. A port to shaders, which has comparable quality to the early versions of xBR, is available. Prior to the port, a shader called \"scalehq\" has often been confused for hqx.\n\nThere are 6 filters in this family: xBR , xBRZ, xBR-Hybrid, Super xBR, xBR+3D and Super xBR+3D.\n\nxBR (\"scale by rules\"), created by Hyllian, works much the same way as HQx (based on pattern recognition), and would generate the same result as HQx when given the above pattern. However, it goes further than HQx by using a 2-stage set of interpolation rules, which better handle more complex patterns such as anti-aliased lines and curves. Scaled background textures keep the sharp characteristics of the original image, rather than becoming blurred like HQx (often ScaleHQ in practice) tends to do. Newest xBR versions are multi-pass and can preserve small details better. There is also a version of xBR combined with Reverse-AA shader called xBR-Hybrid. xBR+3D is a version with a 3D mask that only filters 2D elements.\n\nxBRZ by Zenju is a modified version of xBR. It is implemented from scratch as a CPU-based filter in C++ . It uses the same basic idea as xBR's pattern recognition and interpolation, but with a different rule set designed to preserve fine image details as small as a few pixels. This makes it useful for scaling the details in faces, and in particular eyes. xBRZ is optimized for multi-core CPUs and 64-bit architectures and shows 40–60% better performance than HQx even when running on a single CPU core only. It supports scaling images with an alpha channel, and scaling by integer factors from 2x up to 6x.\n\nSuper xBR is an algorithm developed by Hylian in 2015. It uses some combinations of known linear filters along with xBR edge detection rules in a non-linear way. It works in two passes and can only scale an image by two (or multiples of two by reapplying it and also has anti-ringing filter). Super xBR+3D is a version with a 3D mask that only filters 2D elements.\nThere is also a Super xBR version rewritten in C/C++.\n\nRotSprite is a scaling and rotation algorithm for sprites developed by Xenowhirl. It produces far fewer artifacts than nearest-neighbor rotation algorithms, and like EPX, it does not introduce new colors into the image (unlike most interpolation systems).\n\nThe algorithm first scales the image to 8 times its original size with a modified Scale2× algorithm which treats similar (rather than identical) pixels as matches. It then (optionally) calculates what rotation offset to use by favoring sampled points which are not boundary pixels. Next, the rotated image is created with a nearest-neighbor scaling and rotation algorithm that simultaneously shrinks the big image back to its original size and rotates the image. Finally, overlooked single-pixel details are (optionally) restored if the corresponding pixel in the source image is different and the destination pixel has three identical neighbors.\n\nFast RotSprite is a fast rotation algorithm for pixel art developed by Oleg Mekekechko for Pixel Studio app. It's based on RotSprite but has significantly better performance with slight quality loss. It's able to process larger images in realtime.\n\nInstead of the 8x upscale, Fast RotSprite uses a Scale3x to upscale by 3x. A step of combined rotating and averaging follows. To avoid introducing a new color, the averaged color is then snapped to the closest color in the palette. Details of the algorithm are generally unknown as it is proprietary and for sale on the Unity Asset Store.\n\nThe Kopf–Lischinski algorithm is a novel way to extract resolution-independent vector graphics from pixel art described in the 2011 paper \"Depixelizing Pixel Art\". A Python implementation is available.\n\nThe algorithm has been ported to GPUs and optimized for real-time rendering. The source code is available for this variant.\n\nEdge-directed interpolation (EDI) describes upscaling techniques that use statistical sampling to ensure the quality of an image when scaling it up. There were several earlier methods that involved detecting edges to generate blending weights for linear interpolation or classifying pixels according to their neighbour conditions and using different otherwise isotropic interpolation schemes based on the classification.\nAny given interpolation approach boils down to weighted averages of neighbouring pixels. The goal is to find optimal weights. Bilinear interpolation sets all the weights to be equal. Higher order interpolation methods like bicubic or sinc interpolation consider a larger number of neighbours than just the adjacent ones.\n\nNEDI (New Edge-Directed Interpolation) computes local covariances in the original image, and uses them to adapt the interpolation at high resolution. It is the prototypic filter of this family.\n\nEDIUpsizer is a resampling filter that upsizes an image by a factor of two both horizontally and vertically using NEDI (new edge-directed interpolation). EDIUpsizer also uses a few modifications to basic NEDI in order to prevent a lot of the artifacts that NEDI creates in detailed areas. These include condition number testing and adaptive window size, as well as capping constraints. All modifications and constraints to NEDI are optional (can be turned on and off) and are user configurable. Just note that this filter is rather slow\n\nFastEDIUpsizer is a slimmed down version of EDIUpsizer that is slightly more tuned for speed. It uses a constant 8x8 window size, only performs NEDI on the luma plane, and only uses either bicubic or bilinear interpolation as the fall back interpolation method.\n\nAnother edge-directed interpolation filter. Works by minimizing a cost functional involving every pixel in a scan line. It is slow.\n\nEEDI2 resizes an image by 2x in the vertical direction by copying the existing image to 2*y(n) and interpolating the missing field. It is intended for edge-directed interpolation for deinterlacing (i.e. not really made for resizing a normal image, but can do that as well). EEDI2 can be used with both TDeint and TIVTC, see the discussion link for more info on how to do this.\n\nThe SuperRes shaders use a different scaling method which can be used in combination with NEDI (or any other scaling algorithm). This method is explained in detail here. This method seems to give better results than just using NEDI, and rival those of NNEDI3. These are now also available as an MPDN renderscript.\n\nNNEDI is a family of intra-field deinterlacers which can also be used to enlarge images by powers of two. When being used as a deinterlacer, it takes in a frame, throws away one field, and then interpolates the missing pixels using only information from the kept field. There are so far three major generations of NNEDI.\n\nNNEDI, the original version, works with YUY2 and YV12 input. NNEDI2 added RGB24 support and a special function codice_4 for upscaling. NNEDI3 enhances NNEDI2 with a predictor neural network. Both the size of the network and the neighborhood it examines can be tweaked for a speed-quality tradeoff:This is a quality vs speed option; however, differences are usually small between the amount of neurons for a specific resize factor, however the performance difference between the count of neurons becomes larger as you quadruple the image size. If you are only planning on doubling the resolution then you won't see massive differences between 16 and 256 neurons. There is still a noticeable difference between the highest and lowest options, but not orders of magnitude different.\n\n"}
{"id": "1814362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814362", "title": "United Kingdom–United States relations", "text": "United Kingdom–United States relations\n\nBritish–American relations, also referred to as Anglo-American relations, encompass many complex relations ranging from two early wars to competition for world markets. Since 1940 both countries have been close military allies enjoying the Special Relationship built as wartime allies and NATO partners.\n\nThe two nations are bound together by shared history, an overlap in religion and a common language and legal system, and kinship ties that reach back hundreds of years, including kindred, ancestral lines among English Americans, Scottish Americans, Welsh Americans, Scotch-Irish Americans, Irish Americans, and American Britons, respectively. Today, large numbers of expatriates live in both countries.\n\nThrough times of war and rebellion, peace and estrangement, as well as becoming friends and allies, Britain and the US cemented these deeply rooted links during World War II into what is known as the \"Special Relationship\". In long-term perspective, the historian Paul Johnson has called it the \"cornerstone of the modern, democratic world order\".\n\nIn the early 20th century, the United Kingdom affirmed its relationship with the United States as its \"most important bilateral partnership\" in the current British foreign policy, and the American foreign policy also affirms its relationship with Britain as its most important relationship, as evidenced in aligned political affairs, mutual cooperation in the areas of trade, commerce, finance, technology, academics, as well as the arts and sciences; the sharing of government and military intelligence, and joint combat operations and peacekeeping missions carried out between the United States Armed Forces and the British Armed Forces. Canada has historically been the largest importer of U.S. goods and the principal exporter of goods to the United States. As of January 2015 the UK was fifth in terms of exports and seventh in terms of import of goods.\n\nThe two countries also have had a significant impact of the cultures of many other countries. They are the two main nodes of the Anglosphere, with a combined population of just under 400 million in 2019. Together, they have given the English language a dominant role in many sectors of the modern world.\n\nLeaders of the United Kingdom and United States since 1940:\n\nThe Special Relationship characterises the exceptionally close political, diplomatic, cultural, economic, military, and historical relations between the two countries. It is specially used for relations since 1940.\n\nAfter several failed attempts, the first permanent English settlement in mainland North America was established in 1607 at Jamestown in the Colony and Dominion of Virginia. By 1624, the Colony and Dominion of Virginia ceased to be a charter colony administered by the Virginia Company of London and became a crown colony. The Pilgrims were a small Protestant sect based in England and Amsterdam; they sent a group of settlers on the \"Mayflower\". After drawing up the Mayflower Compact by which they gave themselves broad powers of self-governance, they established the small Plymouth Colony in 1620. In 1630 the Puritans established the much larger Massachusetts Bay Colony; they sought to reform the Church of England by creating a new and \"more pure\" church in the New World.\n\nOther colonies followed in Province of Maine (1622), Province of Maryland (1632), Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (1636) and Connecticut Colony (1636). Later came the founding of Province of Carolina (1663) (divided in 1729 into the Province of North Carolina and the Province of South Carolina). The Province of New Hampshire was founded in 1691. Next came the Province of Georgia in 1732.\n\nThe Province of New York was formed from the conquered Dutch colony of New Netherland. In 1674, the Province of New Jersey was split off from New York. In 1681 William Penn was awarded a royal charter by King Charles II to found Province of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe colonies each reported separately to London. There was a failed effort to group the colonies into the Dominion of New England, 1686–89.\n\nDuring the 17th century, an estimated 350,000 English and Welsh migrants arrived as permanent residents in the Thirteen Colonies. In the century after the Acts of Union 1707 this was surpassed in rate and number by Scottish and Irish migrants.\n\nDuring British settler colonization, liberal administrative, juridical, and market institutions were introduced, positively associated with socioeconomic development. At the same time, colonial policy was also quasi-mercantilist, encouraging trade within the Empire, discouraging trade with other powers, and discouraging the rise of manufacturing in the colonies, which had been established to increase the trade and wealth of the mother country. Britain made much greater profits from the sugar trade of its commercial colonies in the Caribbean.\n\nThe introduction of coercive labor institutions was another feature of the colonial period. All of the Thirteen Colonies were involved in the slave trade. Slaves in the Middle Colonies and New England Colonies typically worked as house servants, artisans, laborers and craftsmen. Early on, slaves in the Southern Colonies worked primarily in agriculture, on farms and plantations growing indigo, rice, cotton, and tobacco for export.\n\nThe French and Indian War, fought between 1754 and 1763, was the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War. The conflict, the fourth such colonial war between France and Britain in North America, resulted in the British acquisition of New France, with its French Catholic population. Under the Treaty of Paris signed in 1763, the French ceded control of French Louisiana east of the Mississippi River to the British, which became known as the Indian Reserve.\n\nThe religious ties between the homeland and the colonies were pronounced. Most of the churches were transplants from England. The Puritans of New England seldom kept in touch with nonconformists in England. Much closer were the transatlantic relationships maintained by the Quakers, especially in Pennsylvania. The Methodists also maintained close ties.\n\nThe Anglican Church was officially established in the Southern colonies, which meant that local taxes paid the salary of the minister, the parish had civic responsibilities such as poor relief, and the local gentry controlled the parish. The church was disestablished during the American Revolution. The Anglican churches in America were under the authority of the Bishop of London, and there was a long debate over whether to establish an Anglican bishop in America. The other Protestants blocked any such appointment. After the Revolution the newly formed Episcopal Church selected its own bishop and kept its distance from London.\n\nData from the US Census in 2000\n\nThe Thirteen Colonies gradually obtained more, albeit limited, self-government. British mercantilist policies became more stringent, benefiting the mother country which resulted in trade restrictions, thereby limiting the growth of the colonial economy and artificially constraining colonial merchants' earning potential. The American Colonies were expected to help repay debt that had accrued during the French and Indian War. Tensions escalated from 1765 to 1775 over issues of taxation without representation and control by King George III. Stemming from the Boston Massacre of 1770 when British Redcoats opened fire on civilians, rebellion consumed the outraged colonists. The British Parliament had imposed a series of taxes such as the Stamp Act of 1765, and later the Tea Act of 1773, against which an angry mob of colonists protested in the Boston Tea Party by dumping chests of tea into Boston Harbor. The British Parliament responded to the defiance of the colonists by passing what the colonials called the Intolerable Acts in 1774. This course of events ultimately triggered the first shots fired in the Battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775 and the beginning of the American War of Independence. A British victory at the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775 agitated tensions even further. While the goal of attaining independence was sought by a majority known as Patriots, a minority known as Loyalists wished to remain as British subjects indefinitely. When the Second Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia in May 1775, deliberations conducted by notable figures such as Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and John Adams eventually resulted in seeking full independence from the mother country. Thus, the Declaration of Independence, unanimously ratified on 4 July 1776, was a radical and decisive break. The United States of America became the first colony in the world to successfully achieve independence in the modern era.\n\nIn early 1775 the Patriots forced all the British officials and soldiers out of the new nation. The British returned in force in August 1776, and captured New York City, which became their base until the war ended in 1783. The British, using their powerful navy, could capture major ports, but 90% of the Americans lived in rural areas where they had full control. After the Patriots captured a British invasion force moving down from Canada in the Saratoga campaign of 1777, France entered the war as an ally of the US, and added the Netherlands and Spain as French allies. Britain lost naval superiority and had no major allies and few friends in Europe. The British strategy was then refocused on the South, where they expected large numbers of Loyalists would fight alongside the redcoats. Far fewer Loyalists took up arms than Britain needed; royal efforts to control the countryside in the South failed. When the British army tried to return to New York, its rescue fleet was turned back by the French fleet and its army was captured by combined French-American forces under General George Washington at the Siege of Yorktown in October 1781. That effectively ended the fighting.\n\nThe Treaty of Paris ended the war in 1783 on terms quite favourable to the new nation.\n\nThe key events were in September 1782, when the French Foreign Minister Vergennes proposed a solution that was strongly opposed by his ally the United States. France was exhausted by the war, and everyone wanted peace except Spain, which insisted on continuing the war until it captured Gibraltar from the British. Vergennes came up with a deal that Spain would accept instead of Gibraltar. The United States would gain its independence but be confined to the area east of the Appalachian Mountains. Britain would take the area north of the Ohio River. In the area south of that would be set up an independent Indian state under Spanish control. It would be an Indian barrier state. The Americans realised that French friendship was worthless during these negotiations: they could get a better deal directly from London. John Jay promptly told the British that he was willing to negotiate directly with them, cutting off France and Spain. The British Prime Minister Lord Shelburne agreed. He was in full charge of the British negotiations and he now saw a chance to split the United States away from France and make the new country a valuable economic partner. The western terms were that the United States would gain all of the area east of the Mississippi River, north of Florida, and south of Canada. The northern boundary would be almost the same as today. The United States would gain fishing rights off Canadian coasts, and agreed to allow British merchants and Loyalists to try to recover their property. It was a highly favourable treaty for the United States, and deliberately so from the British point of view. Shelburne foresaw a highly profitable two-way trade between Britain and the rapidly growing United States, which indeed came to pass.\n\nThe treaty was finally ratified in 1784. The British evacuated their soldiers and civilians in New York, Charleston and Savannah in late 1783. Over 80 percent of the half-million Loyalists remained in the United States and became American citizens. The others mostly went to Canada, and referred to themselves as the United Empire Loyalists. Merchants and men of affairs often went to Britain to reestablish their business connections. Rich southern Loyalists, taking their slaves with them, typically headed to plantations in the West Indies. The British also took away about 3000 free blacks, former slaves who fought the British army; they went to Nova Scotia. Many found it inhospitable and went to Sierra Leone, the British colony in Africa.\n\nThe new nation gained control of nearly all the land east of the Mississippi and south of the St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes. The British colonies of East and West Florida were given to Spain as its reward. The Native American tribes allied with Britain struggled in the aftermath; the British ignored them at the Peace conference, and most came under American control unless they moved to Canada or to Spanish territory. The British kept forts in the American Midwest (especially in Michigan and Wisconsin), where they supplied weapons to Indian tribes.\n\nTrade resumed between the two nations when the war ended. The British allowed all exports to America but forbade some American food exports to its colonies in the West Indies. British exports reached £3.7 million, compared with imports of only £750,000. The imbalance caused a shortage of gold in the US.\n\nIn 1785, John Adams became the first American plenipotentiary minister, now known as an ambassador, to the Court of St James's. King George III received him graciously. In 1791, Great Britain sent its first diplomatic envoy, George Hammond, to the United States.\n\nWhen Great Britain and France went to war in 1793, relations between the United States and Great Britain also verged on war. Tensions were subdued when the Jay Treaty was signed in 1794, which established a decade of peace and prosperous trade relations. The historian Marshall Smelser argues that the treaty effectively postponed war with Britain, or at least postponed it until the United States was strong enough to handle it.\n\nAccording to American historian Samuel Flagg Bemis, the U.S. had a list of outstanding issues:\n\nThe final treaty settled some but not all of the issues. The Federalists called for the Senate to ratify the Jay treaty, but the Republicans were strongly opposed. Led by Jefferson and Madison, the Republicans strongly favored France and believed good relations with Britain would doom republicanism in America. President George Washington waited until the last moment then made the decisive intervention so the Treaty was ratified by exactly a 2/3 vote, and the necessary money was appropriated. The result was two decades of peace in a time of world war that lasted until the Republicans came to power and Jefferson rejected a new treaty and began an economic attack on Britain.\n\nBradford Perkins argues that the treaty was the first to establish a special relationship between Britain and the United States, with a second installment under Lord Salisbury. In his view, the treaty worked for ten years to secure peace between Britain and America: \"The decade may be characterised as the period of \"The First Rapprochement.\" As Perkins concludes, \"For about ten years there was peace on the frontier, joint recognition of the value of commercial intercourse, and even, by comparison with both preceding and succeeding epochs, a muting of strife over ship seizures and impressment. Two controversies with France… pushed the English-speaking powers even more closely together.\" Starting at swords' point in 1794, the Jay treaty reversed the tensions, Perkins concludes: \"Through a decade of world war and peace, successive governments on both sides of the Atlantic were able to bring about and preserve a cordiality which often approached genuine friendship.\"\n\nHistorian Joseph Ellis finds the terms of the treaty \"one-sided in Britain's favor\", but asserts a consensus of historians agrees that it was\n\n\"a shrewd bargain for the United States. It bet, in effect, on England rather than France as the hegemonic European power of the future, which proved prophetic. It recognised the massive dependence of the American economy on trade with England. In a sense it was a precocious preview of the Monroe Doctrine (1823), for it linked American security and economic development to the British fleet, which provided a protective shield of incalculable value throughout the nineteenth century. Mostly, it postponed war with England until America was economically and politically more capable of fighting one.\"\nThe US proclaimed its neutrality in the wars between Britain and France (1793–1815), and profited greatly by selling food, timber and other supplies to both sides.\n\nThomas Jefferson had bitterly opposed the Jay Treaty because he feared it would strengthen anti-republican political enemies. When Jefferson became president in 1801, he did not repudiate the treaty. He kept the Federalist minister, Rufus King in London to negotiate a successful resolution to outstanding issues regarding cash payments and boundaries. The amity broke down in 1805, as relations turned increasingly hostile as a prelude to the War of 1812. Jefferson rejected a renewal of the Jay Treaty in the Monroe–Pinkney Treaty of 1806 as negotiated by his diplomats and agreed to by London; he never sent it to the Senate.\n\nThe legal international slave trade was largely suppressed after Great Britain passed the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act in 1807. At the urging of President Jefferson, the United States passed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves in 1807, to take effect January 1, 1808.\n\nThe United States imposed a trade embargo, namely the Embargo Act of 1807, in retaliation for Britain's blockade of France, which involved the visit and search of neutral merchantmen, and resulted in the suppression of Franco-United States trade for the duration of the Napoleonic Wars. The Royal Navy also boarded American ships and impressed sailors suspected of being British deserters. Expansion into the Midwest (i.e. Ohio to Wisconsin) was hindered by Native American tribes given munitions and support by British agents. Indeed, Britain's goal was the creation of an independent Indian state to block expansion westward by the US.\n\nAfter diplomacy and the boycott had failed, the issue of national honour and independence came to the fore. Brands says, \"The other war hawks spoke of the struggle with Britain as a second war of independence; [Andrew] Jackson, who still bore scars from the first war of independence held that view with special conviction. The approaching conflict was about violations of American rights, but it was also vindication of American identity.\"\n\nFinally in June 1812 President James Madison called for war, and overcame the opposition of business interests in the Northeast. The US strategy called for a war against British shipping and especially cutting off food shipments to the British sugar plantations in the West Indies. Conquest of the northern colonies that later became Canada was a tactic designed to give the US a strong bargaining position. The main British goal was to defeat France, so until that happened in 1814 the war was primarily defensive. To enlist allies among Native Americans, led by Tecumseh, the British promised an independent Indian state would be created in territory claimed by the United States. British and Canadian forces repeatedly repulsed invasions by US forces, which were inadequately prepared, poorly led, and undermined by the unavailability of militia units, whose commanders refused to place them temporarily under federal control. Nevertheless, US forces took control of Lake Erie in 1813, and destroyed the offensive abilities of Native American forces, allied to the British, in the Northwest and South. The British invasion of the Chesapeake Bay in 1814 culminated in the \"Burning of Washington\", but the subsequent British attack on Baltimore was repelled. A British incursion into New York state during 1814 was defeated at the Battle of Plattsburgh, and the invasion of Louisiana that launched before word of a ceasefire had reached General Andrew Jackson was decisively defeated at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815. Negotiations began in 1814 and produced the Treaty of Ghent, which restored the \"status quo ante bellum\": there were no territorial gains by either side, and the British strategy of creating an independent Native American state was abandoned. The United Kingdom retained the theoretical right of impressment, but stopped impressing any sailors, while the United States dropped the issue for good. The US celebrated the outcome as a victorious \"second war of independence\". The British, having finally defeated Napoleon at Waterloo, celebrated that triumph and largely forgot their second war with the US. Tensions between the US and Canada were resolved through diplomacy. The War of 1812 marked the end of a long period of conflict (1775–1815) and ushered in a new era of peace between the two nations.\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine, a unilateral response in 1823 to a British suggestion of a joint declaration, expressed American hostility to further European encroachment in the Western hemisphere. Nevertheless, the United States benefited from the common outlook in British policy and its enforcement by the Royal Navy. In the 1840s several states defaulted on bonds owned by British investors. London bankers avoided state bonds afterwards, but invested heavily in American railroad bonds.\n\nIn several episodes the American general Winfield Scott proved a sagacious diplomat by tamping down emotions and reaching acceptable compromises. Scott handled the \"Caroline\" affair in 1837. Rebels from British North America (now Ontario) fled to New York and used a small American ship called the \"Caroline\" to smuggle supplies into Canada after their rebellion was suppressed. In late 1837, Canadian militia crossed the border into the US and burned the ship, leading to diplomatic protests, a flare-up of Anglophobia, and other incidents.\nTensions on the vague Maine–New Brunswick boundary involved rival teams of lumberjacks in the bloodless Aroostook War of 1839. There was no shooting but both sides tried to uphold national honor and gain a few more miles of timber land. Each side had an old secret map that apparently showed the other side had the better legal case, so compromise was easily reached in the Webster–Ashburton Treaty of 1842, which settled the border in Maine and Minnesota. In 1859, the bloodless Pig War determined the position of the border in relation to the San Juan Islands and Gulf Islands.\n\nBritish leaders were constantly annoyed from the 1840s to the 1860s by what they saw as Washington's pandering to the democratic mob, as in the Oregon boundary dispute in 1844–46. However British middle-class public opinion sensed a \"special relationship\" between the two peoples based on language, migration, evangelical Protestantism, liberal traditions, and extensive trade. This constituency rejected war, forcing London to appease the Americans. During the Trent affair of late 1861, London drew the line and Washington retreated.\n\nIn 1844-48 the two nations had overlapping claims to Oregon. The area was largely unsettled, making it easy to end the crisis in 1848 by a compromise that split the region evenly, with British Columbia to Great Britain, and Washington, Idaho, and Oregon to America. The US then turned its attention to Mexico, which threatened war over the annexation of Texas. Britain tried without success to moderate the Mexicans, but when the war began it remained neutral. The US gained California, in which the British had shown only passing interest.\n\nThe British wanted a stable Mexico to block American expansion to the Southwest, but an unstable Mexico attacked Texas and wanted revenge for its defeat. The result was a vast American expansion. The discovery of gold in California in 1848 brought a heavy demand for passage to the gold fields, with the main routes crossing Panama to avoid a very long slow sailing voyage around all of South America. A railroad was built that carried 600,000 despite the dangerous environment in Panama. A canal in Nicaragua was a much more healthy and attractive possibility, and American businessmen gained the necessary permissions, along with a U.S. treaty with Nicaragua. However the British were determined to block an American canal, and seized key locations on the mosquito coast on the Atlantic that blocked it. The Whigs were in charge in Washington and unlike the bellicose Democrats wanted a business-like peaceful solution. The Whigs took a lesson from the British experience monopolizing the chokepoint of Gibraltar, which produced no end of conflicts, wars, and military and naval expenses for the British. The United States decided that a canal should be open and neutral to all the world's traffic, and not be militarized. Tensions escalated locally, with small-scale physical confrontations in the field. Washington and London found a diplomatic solution. The Clayton-Bulwer Treaty of 1850 guaranteed equal canal rights to both the U.S. and Britain. Each agreed not to colonize Central America. However, disagreements arose and no Nicaragua canal was ever started. By 1857–59, the London government dropped its opposition to American territorial expansion.\n\nThe opening of the transcontinental railroad in 1869 made travel to California fast, cheap and safe. Americans lost interest in canals and focused their attention on building long-distance railways. The British, meanwhile, turned their attention to building the Suez Canal through Egypt. London maintained a veto on American canal building in Nicaragua. In 1890s, the French made a major effort to build a canal through Panama, but it self-destructed through mismanagement, severe corruption, and especially the deadly disease environment. By the late 1890s Britain saw the need for much improved relations with the United States, and agreed to allow the U.S. to build a canal through either Nicaragua or Panama. The choice was Panama. The Hay–Pauncefote Treaty of 1901 replaced the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty, and adopted the rule of neutralization for the Panama Canal which the U.S. built; it opened in 1914.\n\nIn the American Civil War a major Confederate goal was to win recognition from Britain and France, which it expected would lead them to war with the US and enable the Confederacy to win independence. Because of astute American diplomacy, no nation ever recognised the Confederacy and war with Britain was averted. Nevertheless, there was considerable British sentiment in favour of weakening the US by helping the South win. At the beginning of the war Britain issued . The Confederate States of America had assumed all along that Britain would surely enter the war to protect its vital supply of cotton. This \"King Cotton\" argument was one reason the Confederates felt confident in the first place about going to war, but the Southerners had never consulted the Europeans and were tardy in sending diplomats. Even before the fighting began in April 1861 Confederate citizens (acting without government authority) cut off cotton shipments in an effort to exert cotton diplomacy. It failed because Britain had warehouses filled with cotton, whose value was soaring; not until 1862 did shortages become acute.\n\nThe \"Trent\" Affair in late 1861 nearly caused a war. A warship of the U.S. Navy stopped the British civilian vessel RMS \"Trent\" and took off two Confederate diplomats, James Murray Mason and John Slidell. Britain prepared for war and demanded their immediate release. President Lincoln released the diplomats and the episode ended quietly.\n\nBritain realised that any recognition of an independent Confederacy would be treated as an act of war against the United States. The British economy was heavily reliant on trade with the United States, most notably cheap grain imports which in the event of war, would be cut off by the Americans. Indeed, the Americans would launch all-out naval war against the entire British merchant fleet.\n\nDespite outrage and intense American protests, London allowed the British-built CSS \"Alabama\" to leave port and become a commerce raider under the naval flag of the Confederacy. The war ended in 1865; arbitration settled the issue in 1871, with a payment of $15.5 million in gold for the damages caused.\n\nIn January 1863 Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which was strongly supported by liberal elements in Britain. The British government predicted that emancipation of the slaves would create a race war, and that intervention might be required on humanitarian grounds. There was no race war, and the declining capabilities of the Confederacy—such as loss of major ports and rivers—made its likelihood of success smaller and smaller.\n\nRelations were chilly during the 1860s as Americans resented British and Canadian roles during the Civil War. After the war American authorities looked the other way as Irish Catholic \"Fenians\" plotted and even attempted an invasion of Canada to create pressure for an independent Ireland. The Fenians movement collapsed from its own incompetence. Irish American politicians, a growing power in the Democratic Party demanded more independence for Ireland and made anti-British rhetoric—called \"twisting the lion's tail\"—a staple of election campaign appeals to the Irish vote.\n\nThe arbitration of the Alabama Claims in 1872 provided a satisfactory reconciliation; The British paid the United States $15.5 million for the economic damage caused by Confederate warships purchased from it. Canada could never be defended so the British decided to cut their losses and eliminate the risk of a conflict with the U.S. The first ministry of William Gladstone withdrew from all its historic military and political responsibilities in North America. It brought home its troops (keeping Halifax as an Atlantic naval base), and turned responsibility over to the locals. That made it wise in 1867 to unify the separate Canadian colonies into a self-governing confederation named the \"Dominion of Canada\".\n\nBritain persisted in its free trade policy even as its major rivals, the US and Germany, turned to high tariffs (as did Canada). American heavy industry grew faster than Britain, and by the 1890s was crowding British machinery and other products out of the world market. London, however, remained the world's financial center, even as much of its investment was directed toward American railways. The Americans remained far behind the British in international shipping and insurance.\n\nThe American economic \"invasion\" of the British home market demanded a response. Tariffs, although increasingly under consideration, were not imposed until the 1930s. Therefore, British businessmen were obliged to lose their market or else rethink and modernise their operations. The boot and shoe industry faced increasing imports of American footwear; Americans took over the market for shoe machinery. British companies realised they had to meet the competition so they re-examined their traditional methods of work, labour utilisation, and industrial relations, and to rethink how to market footwear in terms of the demand for fashion.\n\nIn 1895 the Venezuela Crisis with the United States erupted. A border dispute between British Guiana and Venezuela caused a major Anglo-American crisis when the United States intervened to take Venezuela's side. Propaganda sponsored by Venezuela convinced American public opinion that the British were infringing on Venezuelan territory. The United States demanded an explanation and Prime Minister Salisbury refused. The crisis escalated when President Grover Cleveland, citing the Monroe Doctrine, issued an ultimatum in late 1895. Salisbury's cabinet convinced him he had to go to arbitration. Both sides calmed down and the issue was quickly resolved through arbitration which largely upheld the British position on the legal boundary line. Salisbury remained angry but a consensus was reached in London, led by Lord Landsdowne, to seek much friendlier relations with the United States. By standing with a Latin American nation against the encroachment of the British, the US improved relations with the Latin Americans, and the cordial manner of the procedure improved diplomatic relations with Britain.\n\nThe Olney-Pauncefote Treaty of 1897 was a proposed treaty between the United States and Britain in 1897 that required arbitration of major disputes. Despite wide public and elite support, the treaty was rejected by the U.S. Senate, which was jealous of its prerogatives, and never went into effect.\n\nArbitration was used to settle the dispute over the boundary between Alaska and Canada, but the Canadians felt betrayed by the result. The Alaska Purchase of 1867 drew the boundary between Canada and Alaska in ambiguous fashion. With the gold rush into the Yukon in 1898, miners had to enter through Alaska and Canada wanted the boundary redrawn to obtain its own seaport. Canada rejected the American offer of a long-term lease on an American port. The issue went to arbitration and the Alaska boundary dispute was finally resolved by an arbitration in 1903. The decision favoured the US when the British judge sided with the three American judges against the two Canadian judges on the arbitration panel. Canadian public opinion was outraged that their interests were sacrificed by London for the benefit of British-American harmony.\n\nThe Great Rapprochement is the convergence of social and political objectives between the United Kingdom and the United States from 1895 until World War I began in 1914. The large Irish Catholic element in the US provided a major base for demands for Irish independence, and occasioned anti-British rhetoric, especially at election time.\n\nThe most notable sign of improving relations during the Great Rapprochement was Britain's actions during the Spanish–American War (started 1898). Initially Britain supported the Spanish Empire and its colonial rule over Cuba, since the perceived threat of American occupation and a territorial acquisition of Cuba by the United States might harm British trade and commercial interests within its own imperial possessions in the West Indies. However, after the United States made genuine assurances that it would grant Cuba's independence (which eventually occurred in 1902 under the terms dictated in the Platt Amendment), the British abandoned this policy and ultimately sided with the United States, unlike most other European powers who supported Spain. In return the US government supported Britain during the Boer War, although many Americans favored the Boers.\n\nVictory in the Spanish–American War had given the United States its own rising empire. This new status was demonstrated in 1900–01, when the US and Britain, as part of the Eight-Nation Alliance, suppressed the Boxer Rebellion and maintained foreign Concessions (colonies) in Qing Dynasty China.\n\nThe naval blockade of several months (1902-1903) imposed against Venezuela by Britain, Germany and Italy over President Cipriano Castro's refusal to pay foreign debts and damages suffered by European citizens in a recent failed . Castro assumed that the Monroe Doctrine would see the U.S. prevent European military intervention, but at the time President Theodore Roosevelt saw the Doctrine as concerning European seizure of territory, rather than intervention per se. Roosevelt also was concerned with the threat of penetration into the region by Germany and Britain. With Castro failing to back down under U.S. pressure and increasingly negative British and American press reactions to the affair, President Roosevelt persuaded the blockading nations to agree to a compromise, but maintained the blockade, during negotiations over the details of refinancing the debt on Washington Protocols. This incident was a major driver of the Roosevelt Corollary and the subsequent U.S. Big Stick policy and Dollar Diplomacy in Latin America.\n\nIn 1907–09, President Theodore Roosevelt sent the \"Great White Fleet\" on an international tour, to demonstrate the power projection of the United States' blue-water navy, which had become second only to the Royal Navy in size and firepower.\n\nThe United States had a policy of strict neutrality and was willing to export any product to any country. Germany could not import anything due to the British blockade, so the American trade was with the Entente. It was financed by the sale of American bonds and stocks owned by the British. When that was exhausted the British borrowed heavily from New York banks. When that credit ran dry in late 1916, a financial crisis was at hand for Britain.\n\nAmerican public opinion moved steadily against Germany, especially in the wake of the Belgian atrocities in 1914 and the sinking of the RMS \"Lusitania\" in 1915. The large German American and Irish Catholic element called for staying out of the war, but the German Americans were increasingly marginalised. The Germans renewed unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917 knowing it would lead to war with the US. Germany's invitation to Mexico to join together in war against the US in the Zimmermann Telegram was the last straw, and the US declared war in April 1917. The Balfour Mission in April and May tried to promote cooperation between the UK and US. The Americans planned to send money, food and munitions, but it soon became clear that millions of soldiers would be needed to decide the war on the Western Front.\n\nThe US sent two million soldiers to Europe under the command of General John J. Pershing, with more on the way as the war ended. Many of the Allied forces were skeptical of the competence of the American Expeditionary Force, which in 1917 was severely lacking in training and experience. By summer 1918, the American doughboys were arriving at 10,000 a day, as the German forces were shrinking because they had run out of manpower.\n\nThe first summit conference took place in London in late 1918, between Wilson and Prime Minister David Lloyd George. It went poorly, as Wilson distrusted Lloyd George as a schemer, and Lloyd George grumbled that the president was excessively moralistic. The two did work together at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, as part of the Big Four. They moderated the demands of French Prime Minister Clemenceau to permanently weaken Germany. Lloyd George later quipped that sitting between them was like \"being seated between Jesus Christ and Napoleon\".\n\nThroughout the 1920s and 1930s, The level of mutual hostility was moderately high. The British diplomatic establishment largely distrusted the United States for a series of reasons. They included British suspicion of America's power, intentions and reliability. Specific frictions included the American rejection of the League of Nations, Roosevelt's sudden devastating withdrawal from the 1933 London economic conference, the unwillingness to soften the war debts owed by Britain to the US treasury, the failure to join in a denunciation of Japan regarding Manchuria in 1933, and the 1930 high American tariffs. In both countries, isolationism was deeply rooted, and the other side was not popular. On the American side, there was widespread distrust of British imperialism, its trade restrictions on the United States, and the cruel treatment of India. The Irish-American community still had bitter resentments. Roosevelt himself was quietly hostile to British imperialism in the 1930s \n\nDespite the tone of hostility, the British government realized the United States was now the stronger power, and made it a cardinal principle of British foreign-policy to \"cultivate the closest relations with the United States\". As a result, Britain decided not to renew its military alliance with Japan, which was becoming a major rival to the United States in the Pacific.\n\nThe US sponsored a successful Washington Naval Conference in 1922 that largely ended the naval arms race for a decade. The rise of American naval power in 1916-1918 marked the end of the Royal Navy's superiority, an eclipse acknowledged in the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, when the United States and Britain agreed to equal tonnage quotas on warships. By 1932, the 1922 treaty was not renewed and Britain, Japan and the US were again in a naval race.\n\nIn 1924 the aristocratic diplomat Esmé Howard returned to Washington as ambassador. Puzzled at first by the provincial background and eccentric style of President Calvin Coolidge, Howard came to like and trust the president, realizing that he was conciliatory and eager to find solutions to mutual problems, such as the Liquor Treaty of 1924 which diminished friction over smuggling. Washington was greatly pleased when Britain ended its alliance with Japan. Both nations were pleased when in 1923 the wartime debt problem was compromised on satisfactory terms. London renegotiated its £978 million debt to the U.S. Treasury by promising regular payments of £34 million for ten years then £40 million for 52 years. The idea was for the US to loan money to Germany, which in turn paid reparations to Britain, which in turn paid off its loans from the US government. In 1931 all German payments ended, and in 1932 Britain suspended its payments to the US, Which angered American public opinion. The British debt was finally repaid after 1945.\n\nThe League of Nations was established, but Wilson refused to negotiate with Republican supporters of the League. They objected to the provision that allowed the League to force the United States to join in a war declared by the League without the approval of Congress or the president. It was defeated in the Senate. The United States never joined the League, leaving Britain and France to dominate the organization. In any case, it had very little effect on major issues and was replaced in 1945 with a United Nations, Largely designed by Roosevelt in his staff, in which both Britain and the United States had veto power. Major conferences, especially the Washington Conference of 1922 occurred outside League auspices. The US refused to send official delegates to League committees, instead sending unofficial \"observers\".\n\nCoolidge was impressed with the success of the Washington Naval Conference of 1921–22, and called the second international conference in 1927 to deal with related naval issues, especially putting limits on the number of warships under 10,000 tons. The conference met in Geneva. It failed because France refused to participate, and most of the delegates were admirals who did not want to limit their fleets. Coolidge listened to his own admirals, but President Hoover did not, and in 1930 did achieve a naval agreement with Britain. A second summit took place between President Herbert Hoover and Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald in the United States in 1929. Both men were seriously devoted to peace, and the meeting went smoothly in discussions regarding naval arms limitations, and the application of the Kellogg–Briand Pact peace pact of 1928. One result was the successful London Naval Treaty of 1930, which continued the warship limitations among the major powers first set out in 1922.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, starting in late 1929, the U.S. was preoccupied with its own internal affairs and economic recovery, espousing an isolationist policy. When the US raised tariffs in 1930, the British retaliated by raising their tariffs against outside countries (such as the US) while giving special trade preferences inside the Commonwealth. The US demanded these special trade preferences be ended in 1946 in exchange for a large loan.\n\nThe overall world total of all trade plunged by over two-thirds, while trade between the US and Britain shrank from $848 million in 1929 to $288 million in 1932, a decline of almost two-thirds (66%).\n\nWhen Britain in 1933 called a worldwide London Economic Conference to help resolve the depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt killed it by refusing to cooperate.\n\nTensions over the Irish question faded with the independence of the Irish Free State in 1922. The American Irish had achieved their goal, and in 1938 its leader Joseph P. Kennedy became ambassador to the Court of St. James's. He moved in high London society and his daughter married into the aristocracy. Kennedy supported the Neville Chamberlain policy of appeasement toward Germany, and when the war began he advised Washington that prospects for Britain's survival were bleak. When Winston Churchill came to power in 1940, Kennedy lost all his influence in London and Washington.\n\nAlthough many of the American people were sympathetic to Britain during the war with Nazi Germany, there was widespread opposition to American intervention in European affairs. This was reflected in a series of Neutrality Acts ratified by the United States Congress in 1935, 1936, and 1937. However, President Roosevelt's policy of cash-and-carry still allowed Britain and France to order munitions from the United States and carry them home.\nChurchill, who had long warned against Germany and demanded rearmament, became prime minister after Chamberlain's policy of appeasement had totally collapsed and Britain was unable to reverse the German invasion of Norway in April 1940. After the fall of France in June 1940, Roosevelt gave Britain and (after June 1941) the Soviet Union all aid short of war. The Destroyers for Bases Agreement which was signed in September 1940, gave the United States a 99-year rent-free lease of numerous land and air bases throughout the British Empire in exchange for the Royal Navy receiving 50 old destroyers from the United States Navy. Beginning in March 1941, the United States enacted Lend-Lease in the form of tanks, fighter airplanes, munitions, bullets, food, and medical supplies. Britain received $31.4 billion out of a total of $50.1 billion sent to the Allies. Roosevelt insisted on avoiding the blunder that Wilson had made in the First World War of setting up the financing as loans that had to be repaid by the recipients. Lend lease aid was freely given, with no payments. Also there were also cash loans were repaid at low rates over a half-century.\n\nSummit meetings became a standard practice starting with August 1941, when Churchill and Roosevelt met on British territory, and announced the Atlantic Charter. It became a fundamental document—All the Allies had to sign it—and it led to the formation of the United Nations. Shortly after Pearl Harbor, Churchill spent several weeks in Washington with the senior staff hammering out wartime strategy with the American counterparts at the Arcadia Conference. They set up the Combined Chiefs of Staff to plot and coordinate strategy and operations. Military cooperation was close and successful.\n\nTechnical collaboration was even closer, as the two nations shared secrets and weapons regarding the proximity fuze (fuse) and radar, as well as airplane engines, Nazi codes, and the atomic bomb.\n\nMillions of American servicemen were based in Britain during the war. Americans were paid five times more than comparable British servicemen, which led to a certain amount of friction with British men and intermarriage with British women.\n\nIn 1945 Britain sent a portion of the British fleet to assist the planned October invasion of Japan by the United States, but this was cancelled when Japan was forced to surrender unconditionally in August.\n\nSerious tension erupted over American demands that India be given independence, a proposition Churchill vehemently rejected. For years Roosevelt had encouraged Britain's disengagement from India. The American position was based on principled opposition to colonialism, practical concern for the outcome of the war, and the expectation of a large American role in a post-colonial era. In 1942 when the Congress Party launched a Quit India movement, the British authorities immediately arrested tens of thousands of activists (including Mahatma Gandhi). Meanwhile, India became the main American staging base for aid to China. Churchill threatened to resign if Roosevelt pushed too hard, so Roosevelt backed down.\n\nIn Spring 1949 the Bank of England issued instructions to British banks restricting the conversion of sterling for any oil that was purchased outside the sterling area. This was particularly damaging to the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO) — Standard Oil of Jersey and Socony had been invited to join the Saudi concession because of their extensive overseas contacts who were now subject to London's embargo. Britain also began bartering oil for payment in kind in defiance of international agreements with the US. Britain devalued its currency in September 1949 and promptly reduced exchanges-for-dollars by restricting American-affiliated oil companies from selling dollar oil within the sterling area until all the sterling oil had been sold. The disagreement was especially dire because Americans wanted to sell the oil they purchased from Saudi Arabia under the new concession arrangement. Eventually the British and the Americans reached an agreement that allowed American companies to sell Saudi oil in the sterling area.\n\nIn the aftermath of the war Britain faced a financial crisis, whereas the United States was in the midst of an economic boom. The process of de-colonization accelerated with the independence Britain granted to India, Pakistan and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in 1947. The Labour government, which was alarmed at the threat of Communism in the Balkans, implored the US to take over the British role in Greece, which led to the Truman Doctrine in 1947, with financial and military aid to Greece and Turkey as Britain withdrew from the region.\n\nThe US provided financial aid in the form of the Anglo-American loan of 1946, a 50-year loan with a low 2% interest rate starting in 1950. A more permanent solution was the Marshall Plan of 1948–51, which poured $13 billion into western Europe, of which $3.3 billion went to Britain to help modernise its infrastructure and business practices. The aid was a gift and carried requirements that Britain balance its budget, control tariffs and maintain adequate currency reserves.\n\nThe need to form a united front against the Soviet threat compelled the US and Britain to cooperate in helping to form the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with their European allies. NATO is a mutual defence alliance whereby an attack on one member country is deemed an attack on all members.\n\nThe United States had an anti-colonial and anti-communist stance in its foreign policy throughout the Cold War. Military forces from the United States and the United Kingdom were heavily involved in the Korean War, fighting under a United Nations mandate. Military forces withdrew when a stalemate was implemented in 1953. During the same year British and American intelligence agencies worked together and were instrumental in planning and initiating the 1953 Iranian coup d'etat.\n\nIn 1954 the US attempted to help the beleaguered French army at the height of the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. They planned Operation Vulture; a planned aerial assault on the opposing communist Viet Minh siege positions. President Eisenhower made American participation reliant on British support, but Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden was opposed and \"Vulture\" was reluctantly cancelled. With the fall of Dien Bien Phu the U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles fell out with Eden. He left the 1954 Geneva Conference, leaving the US to avoid direct association with the negotiations that led to the creation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.\n\nWhen the Suez Crisis erupted in October 1956, the United States feared a wider war, after the Soviet Union threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side. Thus the United States applied sustained econo-financial pressure to encourage and ultimately force the United Kingdom, Israel and France to end their invasion of Egypt. British post-war debt was so large that economic sanctions could have caused a devaluation of sterling. This was something the UK government intended to avoid at all costs, and when it became clear that the international sanctions were serious, the British and their French allies withdrew their forces back to pre-war positions. The following year saw the resignation of Sir Anthony Eden.\n\nAnglo-American cooperation during Eisenhower's presidency was troubled, approaching in 1956 a complete breakdown that represented the lowest point in the relations between the two countries since the 1920s.\n\nThrough the US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement signed in 1958, the United States assisted the United Kingdom in their own development of a nuclear arsenal. The British, however, were financially unable to develop their own delivery systems for nuclear weapons. In April 1963, the Polaris Sales Agreement called for the U.S. to sell the UGM-27 Polaris ballistic missile for use in the Royal Navy's submarine fleet starting in 1968.\n\nThe American containment policy called for military resistance to the expansion of communism, and Vietnam became the main battlefield in the 1950s down to the communist victory in 1975. Harold Wilson, the Prime Minister (1964-1970) believed in a strong \"Special Relationship\" and wanted to highlight his dealings with the White House to strengthen his own prestige as a statesman. President Lyndon Johnson disliked Wilson, and ignored any \"special\" relationship. He agreed to provide financial help but he strongly opposed British plans to devalue the pound and withdraw military units east of Suez. Vietnam was the sore point. As the American military involvement deepened after 1964, Johnson repeatedly asked for British ground units to validate international support for American intervention. Wilson never sent troops, but he did provide help with intelligence, and training in jungle warfare, as well as verbal support. He also took the initiative in attempting numerous mediation schemes, typically involving Russian intervention, none of which gained traction. Wilson's policy Divided the Labour Party; the Conservative opposition generally supported the American position on Vietnam. Issues of foreign policy were rarely salient in general elections. Wilson and Johnson also differed sharply on British economic weakness and its declining status as a world power. Historian Jonathan Colman concludes it made for the most unsatisfactory \"special\" relationship in the 20th century.\n\nEdward Heath (Prime minister 1970-74) and Richard Nixon (President 1969-74) maintained a close working relationship. Heath deviated from his predecessors by supporting Nixon's decision to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong in Vietnam in April 1972. Nevertheless, relations deteriorated noticeably during the early 1970s. Throughout his premiership, Heath insisted on using the phrase \"natural relationship\" instead of \"special relationship\" to refer to Anglo-American relations, acknowledging the historical and cultural similarities but carefully denying anything special beyond that. Heath was determined to restore a measure of equality to Anglo-American relations which the United States had increasingly dominated as the power and economy of the United Kingdom flagged in the post-colonial era.\n\nHeath's renewed push for British admittance to the European Economic Community (EEC) brought new tensions between the United Kingdom and the United States. French President Charles De Gaulle, who believed that British entry would allow undue American influence on the organisation, had vetoed previous British attempts at entry. Heath's final bid benefited from the more moderate views of Georges Pompidou, De Gaulle's successor as President of France, and his own Eurocentric foreign policy schedule. The Nixon administration viewed this bid as a pivot away from close ties with the United States in favour of continental Europe. After Britain's admission to the EEC in 1973, Heath confirmed this interpretation by notifying his American counterparts that the United Kingdom would henceforth be formulating European policies with other EEC members before discussing them with the United States. Furthermore, Heath indicated his potential willingness to consider a nuclear partnership with France and questioned what the United Kingdom got in return for American use of British military and intelligence facilities worldwide. In return, Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger briefly cut off the Anglo-American intelligence tap in August 1973. Kissinger then attempted to restore American influence in Europe with his abortive 1973 \"Year of Europe\" policy plan to update the NATO agreements. Members of the Heath administration, including Heath himself in later years, regarded this announcement with derision.\n\nIn 1973, American and British officials disagreed in their handling of the Arab-Israeli Yom Kippur War. While the Nixon administration immediately increased military aid to Israel, Heath maintained British neutrality in the conflict and imposed a British arms embargo on all combatants, which mostly hindered the Israelis by preventing them obtaining spares for their Centurion tanks. Anglo-American disagreement intensified over Nixon's unilateral decision to elevate American forces, stationed at British bases, to DEFCON 3 status on 25 October in response to the breakdown of the United Nations ceasefire. Heath disallowed American intelligence gathering, resupplying, or refueling from British bases in Cyprus, which greatly limited the effective range of American reconnaissance planes. In return, Kissinger imposed a second intelligence cutoff over this disagreement and some in the administration even suggested that the United States should refuse to assist in the British missile upgrade to the Polaris system. Tensions between the United States and United Kingdom relaxed as the second ceasefire took effect. Wilson's return to power in 1974 helped to return Anglo-American relations to normality.\n\nOn 23 July 1977, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States renegotiated the previous Bermuda I Agreement, and signed the Bermuda II Agreement under which only four airlines, two from the United Kingdom and two from the United States, were allowed to operate flights between London Heathrow Airport and specified \"gateway cities\" in the United States. The Bermuda II Agreement was in effect for nearly 30 years until it was eventually replaced by the EU-US Open Skies Agreement, which was signed on 30 April 2007 and entered into effect on 30 March 2008.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher was strongly supportive of Ronald Reagan's unwavering stance towards the Soviet Union. Often described as \"political soulmates\" and a high point in the \"Special Relationship\", Reagan and Thatcher met many times throughout their political careers, speaking in concert when confronting Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev. During the Soviet-Afghan War Britain supported US military and financial aid to the anti communist mujaheddin insurgents in Operation Cyclone.\n\nIn 1982, the British Government made a request to the United States, which the Americans agreed upon in principle, to sell the Trident II D5 ballistic missile, associated equipment, and related system support for use on four nuclear submarines in the Royal Navy. The Trident II D5 ballistic missile replaced the United Kingdom's previous use of the UGM-27 Polaris ballistic missile, beginning in the mid-1990s.\n\nIn the Falklands War in 1982, the United States initially tried to mediate between the United Kingdom and Argentina, but ended up supporting the United Kingdom's counter-invasion. The U.S. supplied the British military with equipment as well as logistical support.\n\nIn October 1983, the United States and a coalition of Caribbean nations undertook Operation Urgent Fury, codename for the invasion of the Commonwealth to the island nation of Grenada. A bloody Marxist coup had overrun Grenada, and neighboring countries in the region asked the United States to intervene militarily, which it did successfully despite having made assurances to a deeply resentful British Government.\n\nOn 15 April 1986, the U.S. military launched Operation El Dorado Canyon from RAF air bases in England. Thatcher allowed Reagan to use Royal Air Force stations for its bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi in Libya. It was a counter-attack by the United States in response to Muammar Gaddafi's export of state-sponsored terrorism directed towards civilians and American servicemen stationed in Berlin.\n\nOn 21 December 1988, Pan American Worldways' Flight 103 from London Heathrow Airport to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport exploded over the town of Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 169 Americans and 40 Britons on board. The motive that is generally attributed to Libya can be traced back to a series of military confrontations with the United States Navy in the 1980s in the Gulf of Sidra, the whole of which Libya claimed as its territorial waters. Despite a guilty verdict on 31 January 2001 by the Scottish High Court of Justiciary which ruled against Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the bomber, on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder, Libya never formally admitted carrying out the 1988 bombing over Scotland until 2003.\n\nDuring the Soviet–Afghan War, the United States and the United Kingdom throughout the 1980s provided arms to the Mujahideen rebels in Afghanistan until the last troops from the Soviet Union left Afghanistan in February 1989.\n\nWhen the United States became the world's lone superpower after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, new threats emerged which confronted the United States and its NATO allies. With military build-up beginning in August 1990 and the use of force beginning in January 1991, the United States, followed at a distance by Britain, provided the two largest forces respectively for the coalition army which liberated Kuwait from Saddam Hussein's regime during the Persian Gulf War.\n\nIn 1997, the British Labour Party was elected to office for the first time in eighteen years. The new prime minister, Tony Blair, and Bill Clinton both used the expression \"Third Way\" to describe their centre-left ideologies. In August 1997, the American people expressed solidarity with the British people, sharing in their grief and sense of shock on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, who perished in a car crash in Paris, France.\n\nThroughout 1998 and 1999, the United States and Britain sent troops to impose peace during the Kosovo War.\n\n67 Britons were among the 2,977 victims killed during the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, and in an open field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, on September 11, 2001, which were orchestrated by al-Qaeda. Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, there was an enormous outpouring of sympathy from the United Kingdom for the American people, and Tony Blair was one of George W. Bush's strongest international supporters for bringing al-Qaeda and the Taliban to justice. Indeed, Blair became the most articulate spokesman. He was the only foreign leader to attend an emergency joint session of Congress called immediately after the attacks (and remains the only foreign leader ever to attend such a session), where he received two standing ovations from members of Congress. During this session of Congress, President George W. Bush stated matter-of-factly that \"America has no truer friend than Great Britain\".\n\nThe United States declared a War on Terror following the attacks. British forces participated in NATO's war in Afghanistan. Blair took the lead (against the opposition of France, Canada, Germany, China, and Russia) in advocating the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Again Britain was second only to the US in sending forces to Iraq. Both sides wound down after 2009, and withdrew their last troops in 2011. President Bush and Prime Minister Blair provided sustained mutual political and diplomatic support and won votes in Congress and parliament against their critics at home. During this period Secretary of State Donald Rumsfeld said that \"America has no finer ally than the United Kingdom.\"\n\nThe 7 July 2005 London bombings emphasised the difference in the nature of the terrorist threat to both nations. The United States concentrated primarily on global enemies, like the al-Qaeda network and other Islamic extremists from the Middle East. The London bombings were carried out by homegrown extremist Muslims, and it emphasised the United Kingdom's threat from the radicalisation of its own people.\n\nAfter claims by Liberty that British airports had been used by the CIA for extraordinary rendition flights, the Association of Chief Police Officers launched an investigation in November 2005. The report was published in June 2007 and found no evidence to support the claim. This was on the same day the Council of Europe released its report with evidence that the UK had colluded in extraordinary rendition, thus directly contradicting ACPO's findings. A 2018 report by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament found the United Kingdom, specifically the MI5 and MI6, to be complicit in many of the renditions done by the US, having helped fund them, supplying them with intelligence and knowingly allowing them to happen.\n\nBy 2007, support amongst the British public for the Iraq war had plummeted. Despite Tony Blair's historically low approval ratings with the British people, mainly due to allegations of faulty government intelligence of Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction, his unapologetic and unwavering stance for the British alliance with the United States can be summed up in his own words. He said, \"We should remain the closest ally of the US ... not because they are powerful, but because we share their values.\" The alliance between George W. Bush and Tony Blair seriously damaged the prime minister's standing in the eyes of many British citizens. Tony Blair argued it was in the United Kingdom's interest to \"protect and strengthen the bond\" with the United States regardless of who is in the White House. A perception that the relationship was unequal led to use of the term \"Poodle-ism\" in the British media, that Britain and its leaders were lapdogs to the Americans.\n\nAll British servicemen were withdrawn with the exception of 400 who remained in Iraq until 31 July 2009.\n\nOn 11 June 2009, the British Overseas Territory of Bermuda accepted four Chinese Uighurs from the United States' detainment facility known as Guantanamo Bay detention camp located on the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. At the request of the United States Government, Bermudan officials agreed to host Khaleel Mamut, Hozaifa Parhat, Salahidin Abdulahat, and Abdullah Abdulqadirakhun as guest workers in Bermuda who seven years ago, were all captured by Pakistani bounty hunters during the United States-led invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001. This decision agreed upon by American and Bermudan officials drew considerable consternation and contempt by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as it was viewed by British officials in London that they should have been consulted on whether or not the decision to take in four Chinese Uighurs was a security and foreign issue of which the Bermudian government does not have delegated responsibility over.\n\nOn 20 August 2009, The Scottish government headed by Alex Salmond announced that it would release Abdelbaset al-Megrahi on medical grounds. He was the only person convicted of the terrorist plot which killed 169 Americans and 40 Britons on Pan American Worldways' Flight 103 over the town of Lockerbie, Scotland on 21 December 1988. He was sentenced to life in prison in 2001, but was released after being diagnosed with terminal cancer, with around three months to live. Americans said the decision was uncompassionate and insensitive to the memory of the victims of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. President Barack Obama said that the decision was \"highly objectionable\". U.S. Ambassador Louis Susman said that although the decision made by Scotland to release Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was seen by the United States as extremely regrettable, relations with the United Kingdom would remain fully intact and strong. The British government led by Gordon Brown was not involved in the release and Gordon Brown stated at a press conference that they had played 'no role' in the decision. Abdelbaset al-Megrahi died 20 May 2012 at the age of 60.\n\nIn April 2010, the explosion, sinking and resultant oil spill from the \"Deepwater Horizon\" drilling rig led to diplomatic friction and populist anti-British sentiment, even though the rig was owned and operated by the Swiss company Transocean and the cement work carried out by the US company Halliburton . Commentators referred to \"British Petroleum\" even though the company had been known as \"BP\" since 1998. UK politicians expressed concerns about anti-British rhetoric in the US. BP's CEO Tony Hayward was called \"the most hated man in America\". Conversely, the widespread public demonisation of BP and the effects on the company and its image, coupled with Obama's statements with regard to BP caused a degree of anti-American sentiment in the UK. This was particularly evidenced by the comments of the Business Secretary Vince Cable, who said that \"It's clear that some of the rhetoric in the US is extreme and unhelpful\", for reasons of British pension funds, loss of revenues for the exchequer and the adverse effect such the rhetoric was having on the share price of one of the UK's largest companies.\nThe meeting between Barack Obama and David Cameron in July somewhat helped strained diplomatic relations, and President Obama stated that there lies a \"truly special relations\" between the two countries. The degree to which anti-British or anti-American hostilities continue to exist, remains to be seen.\n\nBritish policy is that the relationship with the United States represents the United Kingdom's \"most important bilateral relationship\" in the world. United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton paid tribute to the relationship in February 2009 by saying, \"it stands the test of time\".\n\nOn 3 March 2009, Gordon Brown made his first visit to the Obama White House. During his visit, he presented the president a gift in the form of a pen holder carved from HMS \"Gannet\", which served anti-slavery missions off the coast of Africa. Barack Obama's gift to the prime minister was a box of 25 DVDs with movies including \"Star Wars\" and \"E.T.\" The wife of the prime minister, Sarah Brown, gave the Obama daughters, Sasha and Malia, two dresses from British clothing retailer Topshop, and a few unpublished books that have not reached the United States. Michelle Obama gave the prime minister's sons two Marine One helicopter toys. During this visit to the United States, Gordon Brown made an address to a joint session of the United States Congress, a privilege rarely accorded to foreign heads of government.\n\nIn March 2009, a Gallup poll of Americans showed 36% identified Britain as their country's \"most valuable ally\", followed by Canada, Japan, Israel, and Germany rounding out the top five. The poll also indicated that 89% of Americans view the United Kingdom favourably, second only to Canada with 90%. According to the Pew Research Center, a global survey conducted in July 2009 revealed that 70% of Britons who responded had a favourable view of the United States.\n\nIn 2010, Obama stated \"the United States has no closer friend and ally than the United Kingdom, and I reiterated my deep and personal commitment to the special relationship between our two countries.\"\n\nIn February 2011, \"The Daily Telegraph\", based on evidence from WikiLeaks, reported that the United States had tendered sensitive information about the British Trident nuclear arsenal (whose missile delivery systems are manufactured and maintained in the United States) to the Russian Federation as part of a deal to encourage Russia to ratify the New START Treaty. Professor Malcolm Chalmers of the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies speculated that serial numbers could undermine Britain's non-verification policy by providing Russia \"with another data point to gauge the size of the British arsenal\".\n\nOn 25 May 2011, during his official visit to the UK, Obama reaffirmed the relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States of America in an address to Parliament at Westminster Hall. Amongst other points, Obama stated: \"I've come here today to reaffirm one of the oldest; one of the strongest alliances the World has ever known. It's long been said that the United States and the United Kingdom share a special relationship.\"\n\nIn the final days before the Scottish independence referendum in September 2014, Obama announced in public the vested interest of the United States of America in enjoying the continued partnership with a 'strong and united' UK which he described as \"one of the closest allies we will ever have\".\n\nDuring a joint press conference with Prime Minister Theresa May, Obama stated \"The bottom line is, is that we don't have a stronger partner anywhere in the world than the United Kingdom.\"\nPresident Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May aimed to continue the United Kingdom–United States special relationship. May was the first foreign leader Trump hosted in Washington after taking office and UKIP leader Nigel Farage was the first foreign politician Trump met with after winning the presidential election, when he was still President-elect of the United States. However, Trump was the subject of popular protests in Britain even before he took office, particularly because of his anti-immigration proposals, misogyny and perceived racism. During his presidency there were protests when he was inaugurated, when he announced his first immigration ban on citizens from certain Muslim countries, and when he said he would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n\nOn 4 June 2017, Trump responded to a terror attack on London Bridge by attacking London Mayor Sadiq Khan for saying that there \"was no reason to be alarmed\". The comments were condemned by Khan who stated that his remarks were deliberately taken out of context in that he was referring to an increased police presence in the days after the attack, which should not alarm the public. Trump also suggested that, \"we must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people\".\n\nOn 29 November 2017, Trump re-tweeted three videos posted by Jayda Fransen, deputy leader of the far-right nationalist Britain First party. One of the videos, titled 'Muslim immigrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches', was subsequently discredited by the Dutch embassy in the United States. The spokesperson for the Prime Minister said that what the President had done was 'wrong' and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said that 'hate speech had no place in the UK'. In response, Trump tweeted at the Prime Minister suggesting that she worry about immigration in her own country rather than whom he chose to retweet. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said that the President attempted to start a conversation about immigration.\nMay was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his inauguration, and she invited him to make a return visit. More than 1.8 million U.K citizens signed a petition to rescind the invitation, and Parliament debated a nonbinding resolution to that effect in February 2017. The visit was tentatively planned for late February 2018, and would include a ceremonial opening of the new American embassy in Nine Elms. However, on 11 January 2018, he cancelled the visit and denounced the new embassy in a tweet saying This was despite the official reason for relocating the embassy due to the security, as the Grosvenor Square site couldn't accommodate the requirements for being 100 ft (30.5m) away from the street, and the fact that the move was decided by Obama's predecessor Bush, who approved the relocation in 2008. It was speculated that the real reason for cancelling the visit was due to Trump's unpopularity and the possibility of large protests against him in London.\n\nTrump made a second visit in June 2019, this time as guests of the Queen and to hold talks with May. Thousands protested his visit, just like they did when he made his first trip.\n\nOn 7 July 2019, secret diplomatic cables from Ambassador Kim Darroch to the British government, dating from 2017 to 2019, were leaked to \"The Mail on Sunday\". They included Darroch's unflattering assessments of the Trump administration, e.g. that it was \"inept and insecure\". In response, Nigel Farage said Darroch was \"totally unsuitable\" for office, and Trump tweeted that Darroch was \"not liked or well thought of within the US\" and that \"we will no longer deal with him\". The Prime Minister, Theresa May, expressed support for Darroch and ordered a leak inquiry.\n\nOn 10 July, Darroch resigned as Ambassador to the United States. He wrote that \"the current situation is making it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like\". Previously, Boris Johnson, the frontrunner in the election to replace May, had declined to publicly back Darroch. Consensus among political commentators in the UK was that this made Darroch's position untenable. May and the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, praised Darroch's service in the House of Commons and deplored that he had to resign under pressure from the U.S. Darroch will remain in the post until a successor is appointed.\n\nThe United States accounts for the United Kingdom's largest single export market, buying $57 billion worth of British goods in 2007. Total trade of imports and exports between the United Kingdom and the United States amounted to the sum of $107.2 billion in 2007.\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom share the world's largest foreign direct investment partnership. In 2005, American direct investment in the United Kingdom totaled $324 billion while British direct investment in the United States totaled $282 billion.\n\nIn a press conference that made several references to the special relationship, US Secretary of State John Kerry, in London with UK Foreign Secretary William Hague on 9 September 2013, said:\n\n\"We are not only each other's largest investors in each of our countries, one to the other, but the fact is that every day almost one million people go to work in America for British companies that are in the United States, just as more than one million people go to work here in Great Britain for American companies that are here. So we are enormously tied together, obviously. And we are committed to making both the U.S.-UK and the U.S.-EU relationships even stronger drivers of our prosperity.\"\nMore than 4.5 million Britons visit the United States every year, spending approximately $14 billion. Around 3 million people from the United States visit the United Kingdom every year, spending approximately $10 billion.\n\nAll three major American airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Airlines fly directly between the U.S. and the UK, principally between London and New York, although all three fly to London Heathrow Airport from a number of hubs, as well as to other major UK airports such as Birmingham Airport, Manchester Airport, Edinburgh Airport and Glasgow Airport. Additionally, Delta codeshares with the UK's Virgin Atlantic which it owns a 49% stake in. Low-cost carriers JetBlue & Southwest fly between the eastern U.S. and the British overseas territories of Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands and the Turks & Caicos Islands.  The British flag carrier British Airways flies to over twenty destinations in the U.S. Also the main British charter airline, TUI Airways fly to the U.S. although principally to the holiday destinations of Florida and California. While long-haul low-cost carrier Norwegian flies from London Gatwick Airport to ten American airports.\n\nBoth American Airlines and BA are founders of the airline alliance, Oneworld. BA, TUI Airways and Virgin Atlantic are major purchasers of American-made Boeing aircraft. Flying between the U.S. and UK is at the moment in 2019 supported by the US-EU Open Skies Agreement which came about in 2008, which allows any airline from both countries to fly between each other.\n\nNew York's John F. Kennedy International Airport is the most popular international destination for people flying out of London Heathrow Airport. Approximately 2,802,870 people on multiple daily non-stop flights flew from Heathrow to JFK in 2008. Concorde, British Airways flagship supersonic airliner, began trans-Atlantic service to Washington Dulles International Airport in the United States on May 24, 1976. The trans-Atlantic route between London's Heathrow and New York's JFK in under 3½ hours, had its first operational flight between the two hubs on October 19, 1977 and the last being on October 23, 2003.\n\nThe two main American intercity bus carriers; Greyhound Lines and during the period from 1999 to 2019 Coach USA, plus their subsidiaries are each owned by a major British transportation company FirstGroup with Greyhound and Stagecoach with Coach USA. Coach USA's budget brand Megabus which started in 2006, itself is a copycat of the British version of the discount coach company that started in 2003. The American private rail company Virgin Trains USA, formerly known as Brightline is partly owned by the British investor Virgin Group.\n\nIn the 20th century, there were 78 formal and informal summits bringing together the president and the prime minister to deal with an agreed-upon agenda. The first was 1918, the second in 1929. The rest began in 1941, which marked the decline of ambassadors as the key transmitters of policy discussions. In three out of four of the summits, the British delegation traveled to America. Summits have become much less important in the 21st century, with its new communication modes.\n\nState visits involving the head of state have been made over the years by four presidents and two monarchs. Queen Elizabeth II has met all the presidents since Truman except Johnson. In addition, the Queen made three private visits in 1984, 1985, and 1991 to see stallion stations and stud farms.\n\n\n\nThe \"Strategic Alliance Cyber Crime Working Group\" is an initiative by Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and headed by the United States as a \"formal partnership between these nations dedicated to tackling larger global crime issues, particularly organised crime\". The cooperation consists of \"five countries from three continents banding together to fight cyber crime in a synergistic way by sharing intelligence, swapping tools and best practices, and strengthening and even synchronising their respective laws\".\n\nWithin this initiative, there is increased information sharing between the United Kingdom's National Crime Agency and the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation on matters relating to serious fraud or cyber crime.\n\nThe UK-USA Security Agreement is an alliance of five English-speaking countries; Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, for the sole purpose of sharing intelligence. The precursor to this agreement is essentially an extension of the historic BRUSA Agreement which was signed in 1943. In association with the ECHELON system, all five nations are assigned to intelligence collection and analysis from different parts of the world. For example, the United Kingdom hunts for communications in Europe, Africa, and Russia west of the Ural Mountains whereas the United States has responsibility for gathering intelligence in Latin America, Asia, Asiatic Russia, and northern mainland China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States and Britain share many threads of cultural heritage.\n\nSince English is the main language of both the British and the Americans, both nations belong to the English-speaking world. Their common language comes with (relatively minor) differences in spelling, pronunciation, and the meaning of words.\n\nThe American legal system is largely based on English common law. The American system of local government is rooted in English precedents, such as the offices of county courts and sheriffs. Although the U.S. remains more highly religious than Britain, the largest Protestant denominations emerged from British churches brought across the Atlantic, such as the Baptists, Methodists, Congregationalists and Episcopalians.\n\nBritain and the United States practice what is commonly referred to as an Anglo-Saxon economy in which levels of regulation and taxes are relatively low, and government provides a low to medium level of social services in return.\n\nIndependence Day, July 4, is a national celebration which commemorates the July 4, 1776 adoption of the Declaration of Independence from the British Empire. American defiance of Britain is expressed in the American national anthem, \"The Star Spangled Banner\", written during the War of 1812 to the tune of a British celebratory song as the Americans beat off a British attack on Baltimore.\n\nIt is estimated that between 40.2 million and 72.1 million Americans today have British ancestry, i.e. between 13% and 23.3% of the U.S. population. In the 1980 US Census, 61,311,449 Americans reported British ancestry reaching 32.56% of the U.S. population at the time which, even today, would make them the largest ancestry group in the United States.\n\nParticular symbols of the close relationship between the two countries are the JFK Memorial and the American Bar Association's Magna Carta Memorial, both at Runnymede in England.\n\nBoth the United States and the United Kingdom share the similarity that a majority of their populations state that their belief is Christian, at 70.4% in the U.S. and 59.5% in the UK. Also, both countries share that a majority of these Christian followers are members of the mainline Protestant group of churches, rather than the Roman Catholic Church, although the Catholic church is relatively sizeable in both countries. Many of these mainline Protestant churches in the United States have their origins in the United Kingdom or their founders were British. This includes Episcopal (Anglican), Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, Congregational, and Quaker.\n\nNevertheless, there are some three big disparities between the two nations in the role of religion and faith. Firstly, the United Kingdom has an established church in two of the four nations of the country; the Anglican Church of England, which the head of state is the head of the church in one, and the Presbyterian Church of Scotland who plays a notable role of the other. The United States on the other hand requires a strict separation of church and state, as stated in the First Amendment.\n\nAnother sizable difference between the U.S. and the UK is the piety of followers, as the UK much more secular than the U.S. A Gallup poll in 2015 reported that 41% of Americans said they regularly attend religious services, compared to just 10% of Britons. Thirdly, a preeminent distinction amidst the two countries is the declaration of faith. In the United Kingdom, religion, especially those that follow the mainstream Protestant churches, is rarely discussed and the country is a secular society. However, in the U.S., religion and faith are seen as a major part of the personal being and declarations are much more stronger.\n\nThe differing attitude about religion among the two nations has causes a large schism between the two nations, and much of the general attitude of the society as a whole on fundamental social issues including abortion, minority rights, blasphemy, the role of church and the state in society etc.\n\nBoth the United States and the United Kingdom share a number of followers the other minority faiths that are practiced in both counties including Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Paganism and Buddhism. Although the numbers and type of faith practice in both countries differ wildly due to the ethnic and cultural makeup of both countries.\n\nThe United Kingdom also has a large number of those possessing no faith or are agnostic with 25.7% saying they are irreligious, compared with just 10% in the United States who say that they don't believe in a God. Many notable British atheists including Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens are known in the U.S. The Atheist Bus campaign which started in London in 2008 by Ariane Sherine, was copied by local atheists in America and put on buses in Washington D.C. and the Bloomington, Indiana.\n\nMany classic dishes or foods from American cuisine such as hamburgers, hot dogs, barbecue chicken, southern fried chicken, deep-pan pizza, chewing gum, tomato soup, chilli-con-carne, chocolate chip cookies, chocolate brownies, soft-scoop ice cream and donuts are popular in the United Kingdom. Drinks like cola, milkshakes and bourbon are also popular. A number of major American food trends and fads have also been popular and influential in the British palate, for example weight management diets and craft beer.\n\nSome American foods like cornflakes, baked beans & crisps [potato chips] have become so entrenched in the UK's food culture that they have completely lost their American roots and are considered part of British cuisine. While some British foods have been just as nativised in the U.S. such as apple pie, whisky, macaroni and cheese and sandwiches. Breakfast cereals like corn flakes, bran flakes and puffed rice came from the U.S. to the UK in the beginning of twentieth century, and virtually changed the perception of breakfasts locally.\n\nMany major American food and fast moving consumer goods companies have British operations includes Molson Coors, McCormick & Company, Kellogg's, Campbell's, Kraft-Heinz, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola & Mondelez The major British food manufacturers that operate in the United States are Unilever, Associated British Foods and Diageo. The purchase of the British food company Cadbury's by then company Kraft Foods in 2010, caused a storm on whether the company would change the recipe for its signature chocolate and the conditions at Cadbury's food factories.\n\nAdditionally, there are several American restaurant and café chains like McDonalds, Burger King, KFC, Domino's Pizza, Pizza Hut, Krispy Kreme, and Starbucks that have enterprises on the other side of the Atlantic. A small number of British chains like Pret a Manger, YO! Sushi and Itsu have operations in the U.S., principally around New York City. The British catering company Compass Group has several catering contracts in the States, including for the federal government and US military.\n\nSince the 2016 EU referendum, there has been growing concern about whether in a possible UK-U.S. free trade agreement would lead to changes in food practices and laws in the UK. The concern is that American food standards laws are much more looser than the UK, such as rules governing cleanliness, the use of antibiotics and pesticides, animal welfare conditions and the use of genetically modified food. Much of these concerns have been symbolised by the production process of American poultry, often known as \"chlorinated chicken\".\n\nBoth the U.S. and UK are considered \"cultural superpowers\", with both countries having a large scale influence around the world in film, music, literature, and television.\n\nLiterature is transferred across the Atlantic Ocean, as evidenced by the appeal of British authors such as William Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, J. R. R. Tolkien, Jackie Collins, and J. K. Rowling in the United States, and American authors such as Harriet Beecher Stowe, Mark Twain, Ernest Hemingway, Stephen King and Dan Brown in Britain. Henry James moved to Britain and was well known in both countries, as was T. S. Eliot. Eliot moved to England in 1914 and became a British subject in 1927. He was a dominant figure in literary criticism and greatly influenced the Modern period of British literature.\n\nIn the UK, many noted American novels including \"The\" \"Catcher in the Rye\", \"Roll of Thunder, Hear my Cry\" \",\" \"Of Mice & Men\", \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", \"The Great Gatsby\" & \"The Color Purple\" are frequently used texts for British secondary-level education English and English Literature exams as set by the main examination boards.\n\nIn area of press, connections between the U.S. and the UK in terms of print content there is slight, however it is strong in online content. Until 2016, a condensed version of \"The New York Times\" was inside \"The Observer\" newspaper. In some newsagents in the UK, you can find international editions of \"USA Today\", \"The New York Times International Edition\", the Europe edition of \"Time\", \"Newsweek\", \"The New Yorker\", \"New York\" magazine and \"Foreign Affairs\". While in the US you would be able to find the international edition of \"The Economist\" and in New York City, the \"Financial Times\". After Rupert Murdoch's purchase of the \"New York Post\" in November 1976, he redesigned the newspaper into a populist right-wing tabloid, likewise his earlier relaunch of the British \"Sun\" newspaper as a down-market tabloid from 1969.\n\nIn magazine publishing, the two big American magazine publishing houses of Hearst and Condé Nast have operations in the UK, with British editions of \"Good Housekeeping\", \"GQ\", \"Men’s Health\", \"Cosmopolitan\", \"Vogue\", \"National Geographic\" and \"Wired\" among others. On occasions, some of the American editions are also available for purchase usually next to the local edition or in the international section. In British magazines in the US, Northern & Shell has since 2005 created an American version of \"OK!\" magazine.\n\nThere are a number of Americans and British in each other countries' press corp, including editors, correspondents, journalists and columnists. Individuals born in the United States active in the British press corp include the \"FT\"s news editor Peter Spiegel, \"Daily Telegraph\" columnist Janet Daley, and \"Guardian\" columnists Tim Dowling and Hadley Freeman. Originally from the UK were Christopher Hitchens (1949–2011) and the current editor of Vogue, Anna Wintour. The current CEO of The New York Times Company is the former Director-General of the BBC (effectively a CEO), Mark Thompson. The current editor-in-chief of the London-based \"Guardian\" since 2015, Katharine Viner was previously the editor of \"The Guardian\"s American website between 2014 and 2015.\n\nIn terms of online content, three newspaper-online sites have American editions, TheGuardian.com, Mail Online and \"The Independent\". BBC News Online is a frequently visited by Americans. The American online news sites BuzzFeed, Breitbart News and \"HuffPost\" (formerly \"The Huffington Post\") all possess British-based editions.\n\nThere is much crossover appeal in the modern entertainment culture of the United Kingdom and the United States. For example, Hollywood blockbuster movies made by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas have had a large effect on British audiences in the United Kingdom, while the James Bond and Harry Potter series of films have attracted high interest in the United States. Also, the animated films of Walt Disney as well as those of Pixar, DreamWorks, Don Bluth, Blue Sky, Illumination and others have continued to make an indelible mark and impression on British audiences, young and old, for almost 100 years. Films by Alfred Hitchcock continuously make a lasting impact on a loyal fan base in the United States, as Alfred Hitchcock himself influenced notable American filmmakers such as John Carpenter, in the horror and slasher film genres.\n\nProduction of films are often shared between the two nations, whether it be a concentrated use of British and American actors or the use of film studios located in London or Hollywood.\n\nBroadway theatre in New York City has toured London's West End theatre over the years, with notable performances such as \"The Lion King\", \"Grease\", \"Wicked\", and \"Rent\". British productions, such as \"Mamma Mia!\" and several of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals, including \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\", \"Cats\" and \"The Phantom of the Opera\" have found success on Broadway. For over 150 years, Shakespeare's plays have been overwhelmingly popular with upscale American audiences.\n\nBoth the United Kingdom and the United States have television shows which are similar, as they are either carried by the other nations' networks, or are re-created for distribution in their own nations. Some popular British television shows that were re-created for the American market in more recent years include \"House of Cards\", \"The Office\", \"Pop Idol\" (\"American Idol\"), \"Strictly Come Dancing\" (\"Dancing with the Stars)\", \"Top Gear\", \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\", \"Weakest Link\" and \"The X Factor\". Some American television shows re-created for the British market in more recent years include \"The Apprentice\" and \"Deal or No Deal\". Popular American television shows that are currently popular in the United Kingdom include \"The Big Bang Theory\", \"\" series, \"Family Guy\", \"Friends\", \"Modern Family\", \"Scrubs\", \"The Simpsons\", and \"South Park\".\n\nThe BBC airs two networks in the United States, BBC America and BBC World News. The American network PBS collaborates with the BBC and rebroadcasts British television shows in the United States such as \"Doctor Who\", \"Keeping Up Appearances\", \"Masterpiece Theatre\", \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", \"Nova\". The BBC also frequently collaborates with American network HBO, showing recent American mini-series in the United Kingdom such as \"Band of Brothers\", \"The Gathering Storm\", \"John Adams\", and \"Rome\". Likewise, the American network Discovery Channel has partnered with the BBC by televising recent British mini-series in the United States such as \"Planet Earth\" and \"The Blue Planet\", the latter popularly known as \"The Blue Planet: Seas of Life\" in the American format. The United States' public affairs channel C-SPAN, broadcasts Prime Minister's Questions every Sunday.\n\nOn some British digital television platforms, it is also possible to watch American television channels that are tailored for British audiences such as CNBC Europe, CNN International, ESPN Classic, Comedy Central, PBS America and Fox. The Super Bowl, the National Football League's championship tournament of American football which occurs every February, has been broadcast in the United Kingdom since 1982. Conversely, the Premier League has been shown on NBC Sports Network in the United States. Until 2017, Formula One television coverage in the United States has used an American-based team but the announcers are British; from 2018 Sky Sports has taken over Formula One coverage through ESPN2.\n\nCompared to music and television broadcasting, radio broadcasting is limited between both sides of the pond. There are several reasons for this. The major one is that the majority of radio broadcasting in the United States is commercial and funded by advertising and the small network of public radio stations are supported by donations, compared to the United Kingdom where the national public broadcaster, the BBC is the major player which funded by the obligatory television licence. This leads to a completely different structure of number and type of radio stations and its broadcasting schedules.\n\nOther factors include differing technical standards of radio broadcasting. This is influenced by their countries' broadcasting authorities which shapes over-the-air radio. In the UK, it is influenced by authorities of Ofcom and the EBU which are working towards DAB and DRM. While in the United States, it influenced by FCC which is working towards HD Radio.\n\nThe British international broadcasting station, the BBC World Service is syndicated on various major city public radio stations in the United States such as WNYC, and on SiriusXM satellite radio, through the broadcaster American Public Media. However, due to the factor that the United Kingdom is English-speaking and has a democratic system, the American international broadcaster, Voice of America has got no remit in be needed to be heard in the UK, so it doesn't broadcast there and none of its programmes is relayed on domestic stations. In a resource-saving exercise between the two international broadcasters, Voice of America shares its transmission towers with the BBC World Service to help of shortwave transmissions in remote areas.\n\nInternet radio and streaming services are growing in popularity in both countries, however listening to each other's feeds are hampered by the countries’ broadcasting rights. This causes the internet radio feeds of American and British radio stations are sometimes blocked or on restricted bandwidth. For example, BBC Radio 2 is on a 128 kbit/s AAC domestic stream, while internationally it's on a 48 kbit/s AAC+ stream. However both the American and the British international broadcasters Voice of America and the BBC World Service is fully accessible online in each other's countries. Streaming services that are popular in both countries include the American TuneIn, Apple Music and Swedish-owned Spotify. The other major services in the US like Pandora Radio and Radio.com don't operate in the UK, and are inaccessible.\n\nIn the past before the Second World War, connections between the United States and the United Kingdom in the radio industry was virtually unheard of. Radio in the UK was not influenced by the U.S., due to the vast distance, and the only regular services that were heard was the BBC and the \"pirate\" station Radio Luxembourg.\n\nWhen the Americans joined the war as part of the Allies, some soldiers were billeted in the UK in which the BBC provided programming for these people. So the Forces Programme, broadcast many popular American variety shows such as \"Charlie McCarthy\", \"The Bob Hope Show\", and \"The Jack Benny Program.\" As the Forces Programme, and the subsequent General Forces Programme, was easily available for civilians they were also heard by domestic audiences.\n\nAfter the War in 1946 on the Home Service, the BBC started to broadcast the factual programme \"Letter from America\", which was presented by Alistair Cooke, bring informing about the States to British audiences until Cook's death in 2004. It was one of the BBC's longest-running radio programmes, broadcasting on the Home Service, and continuing on BBC Radio 4. It was also relayed on the BBC World Service. The programme itself was based on a similar programme by Alistair Cooke in the 1930s for American listeners about life in the UK on the NBC Red Network. After Letter from America, the BBC continued with a factual programme about the States in \"Americana\" from 2009 to 2011, presented by the resident American correspondent.\n\nAs of 2019, the BBC co-produced with Public Radio International and WGBH Boston, a weekly factual programme called \"The World\", which is broadcast on various American public radio stations. Parts of the show are put together for a shorter programme called \"Boston Calling\", which is available on Radio 4 and the domestic feed of the World Service. There have been attempts in the past to bring British formats to American audiences, such as the News Quiz USA. From 2005 to 2011, a time-shifted version of BBC Radio 1 was available on Sirius satellite radio. While in the UK, \"A Prairie Home Companion\" (called Garrison Keillor's Radio Show) was available weekly from 2002 on BBC7 to 2016, on BBC Radio 4 Extra.\n\nThere has been a number of American personalities that have been on British airwaves included music journalist Paul Gambaccini, disc jockey Suzi Quattro and comedians Rich Hall and Greg Proops. While New Zealand-born disc jockey Zane Lowe, who spent much of career in the UK was recruited to Apple's Beats 1 station.\n\nAmerican artists such as Whitney Houston, Madonna, Tina Turner, Cher, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey, Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Diana Ross, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Frank Sinatra, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift and Beyoncé, are popular in the United Kingdom. British artists such as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Sting, The Who, Queen, Shirley Bassey, Tom Jones, David Bowie, Pink Floyd, the Spice Girls, the Bee Gees, Amy Winehouse, KT Tunstall, Leona Lewis, Elton John (Elton John recorded \"Candle in the Wind\" which, to date, is the best ever selling single worldwide), Coldplay and Adele have achieved much success in the large American market. Undoubtedly, the popular music of both nations has had a strong sway on each other.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, many Hollywood films as well as Broadway musicals are closely associated and identified with the musical scores and soundtracks created by famous American composers such as George Gershwin, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Henry Mancini, John Williams, Alan Silvestri, Jerry Goldsmith, and James Horner.\n\nThe Celtic music of the United Kingdom has had a dynamic effect upon American music. In particular, the traditional music of the Southern United States is descended from traditional Celtic music and English folk music of the colonial period, and the musical traditions of the South eventually gave rise to country music and, to a lesser extent, American folk.\n\nThe birth of jazz, swing, big band, and especially rock and roll, all developed and originating in the United States, had greatly influenced the later development of rock music in the United Kingdom, particularly British rock bands such as The Beatles and Herman's Hermits, The Rolling Stones, while its American precursor, the blues, greatly influenced British electric rock.\n\nDespite sports being a major cultural interest in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The most popular team sports in each country, which are in the UK: football (soccer), rugby union, rugby league and cricket and the U.S.: [American] football, baseball, ice hockey and basketball are considered minor sports in either other country. However, there is a growing interest the other countries sports in each other country. Another area of differing tastes in sports between the UK and the U.S. is motorsport, In the UK: Formula 1, rallying and speedway are popular. While in the U.S., the main popular motorsports are NASCAR and the Indianapolis 500.\n\nIn the current 2019-2020 season, three Americans are in the FA's top-tier Premier League: Cameron Carter-Vickers (Tottenham Hotspur), Christian Pulisic (Chelsea), and DeAndre Yedlin (Newcastle United). All three players play for the U. S. national team, although only Pulisic is on the current team, while the others are in reserve. The current team also has two more players from the second tier EFL Championship, Tim Ream (Fulham) and Matt Miagza (Reading).\n\nIn the current Major League Soccer 2019 season, there are nine English players playing; Mo Adams (Atlanta), Jack Elliott (Philadelphia), Michael Mancienne (New England), Luke Mulholland (Real Salt Lake), Nedum Onuoha (Real Salt Lake), Dion Pereira (Atlanta), Jack Price (Colorado), Wayne Rooney (D.C. United) and Bradley Wright-Phillips (New York Red Bulls). There are also four Scottish players playing in the 2019 season; Gary Mackay-Steven (New York City FC), Sam Nicholson (Colorado), Johnny Russell (Sporting Kansas City) & Danny Wilson (Colorado). Only Johnny Russell currently plays for the Scottish national team, while none of the English players play for their national team. The most noted Briton that is playing at the moment is Wayne Rooney who previously captained England, and the most noted former player is David Beckham who played from 2007 to 2012 for the LA Galaxy.\n\nThe last competitive match between the national teams of England and the U.S., was at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. The match ended in a 1–1 draw. The Premier League can be watched in the United States on NBC Sports, while a few MLS games can be watched in the UK on Sky Sports.\n\nGridiron football, which is known in the United Kingdom as American football, originated from two British sports, association football and rugby union football. It came about in the later part of the 19th century due to the development into a separate code and led to becoming a separate sport from the other codes of football. Gridiron was in the past only known and played in UK by visiting American servicemen; firstly in 1910, by navy crews from \"USS Georgia, USS Idaho\" and \"USS Vermont\", and then in the Second World War by UK-based service personnel. (The other gridiron code, Canadian football, is hardly known in UK.)\n\nIt was not until the TV network Channel 4 started showing the highlights of the American NFL in 1982, that the sport became acknowledged the British sporting world. Due to unfamiliarity of the sport, television guides and newspapers had printed out guides explaining the sport. A year later, the first match between two British teams the London Ravens and the Northwich Spartans was played, in that game the Ravens won. Later the in the 1980s, the sport grew and rival teams started to play, which was helped by support from various American players, coaches and sponsors like Coca-Cola & Budweiser. In 1986, the first ever official NFL game to play at the home of English sport, Wembley between the Chicago Bears and the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nHowever, by the early 1990s due to the recession, Channel 4 stopping regular showings of the NFL in 1997 and falling interest, it lost its popularity. Nevertheless, the Super Bowl has continued been regularly shown on British television and the NFL has been broadcast by other broadcasters including ITV, Channel 5, ESPN UK, British Eurosport and the current broadcaster, Sky Sports.\n\nIn 2007 the NFL returned to Wembley with a regular season game between the Miami Dolphins and the New York Giants. There has been a further games played at Wembley since with an average attendance of well over 80,000. Due to this, there has also been growing interest to set up a resident NFL franchise in London, with Jacksonville Jaguars being the most likely team to relocate to the city. As of 2019, noted currently playing British gridiron players are Carolina Panthers defensive end, Nigerian-born Efe Obada and Atlanta Falcons tight end, Alex Grey.\n\nThe first recorded writings about a sport called \"\"base-ball\"\" came in the mid-18th century when a version of the sport played indoors in 1748 in London, where it was played by then Prince of Wales, George III, and played outside in 1755 in the southern English town of Guildford. It was later brought over to the United States by British immigrants, where it developed in the modern version of the sport in the early 19th century in the creation and fountain of the modern baseball rule book, the Knickerbocker Rules in 1845. Eventually, it suppressed the popularity of the other notable ball-and-bat sport which was played in the U.S. at the time which was cricket, by the end of the 19th century.\n\nBaseball was first brought over to the United Kingdom end of the 19th century, by Francis Ley, a Derby man who had 'discovered' the game on a trip to the United States, and Albert Goodwill Spalding, an American former star player and sporting goods businessman who saw opportunities to expand his business across the Atlantic. This continued with the establishment of the National Baseball League of Great Britain and Ireland in 1890, with many of current famous football teams like Aston Villa, Nottingham Forest and Derby County were also baseball teams.\n\nLike the other noted American sport of gridiron, during the First World War visiting U.S. service personnel from the U.S. Army and Navy did a demonstration game at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge in 1918. This was received to a crowd of 38,000 people which even included the king George V. This led to into a growing interest in the game across the Atlantic, and baseball teams were created during the inter-wars. This led to a peak in 1938 when there was a victory by Great Britain over the United States in the 1938 Amateur World Series which was held in England, which is considered the first World Cup of Baseball.\n\nThe popularity of baseball in the United Kingdom diminished during and after the Second World War by other sports and today, baseball isn't widely played among Britons. Notwithstanding, Major League Baseball and the show \"Baseball Tonight are\" available to watch the United Kingdom on the BT Sport ESPN channel. On a growing back of interest in American sports, in 2018 Major League Baseball agreed a two-year deal to field four games a year during the 2019 and 2020 seasons at the London Stadium under the name 2019 MLB London Series. The games are between the four big teams; the New York Yankees, the Boston Red Sox, the Chicago Cubs and the St Louis Cardinals. These games are available to watch not just on BT Sport, but also the BBC.\n\n\nAnglo-American Cooperation, 1933- 1938\" (PhD dissertation, McGill University, 1996) online free bibliography pp 373–91.\n\n\n"}

It is separated from Cobourg Peninsula in the west by Bowen Strait, which is 2.5 km wide in the south and up to 7 km in the north, and 8.5 km long. In the north and east is the Arafura Sea, and in the south and southeast Mountnorris Bay. Croker Island measures 43 km from Point David (south, local name \"Inngirnatj\") to Cape Croker (north), up to 15 km wide, and has an area of 331.5 km² (128.0 sq. miles). At its highest point it is only 15 m (50 feet) above sea level. Croker Island is the largest island, and the only permanently inhabited island, in the Croker Group.\n\nAt the earliest time of European contact, the indigenous people of Croker Island were the Jaako, who spoke Marrgu, a language isolate. The modern indigenous communities speak Iwaidja and Mawng.\n\nThe only notable settlement on Croker Island is the Aboriginal community of Minjilang, located on Mission Bay on the east coast. Apart from that, there are nine small family outstations, the largest ones of which is Inngirnatj (Point David) at the southern end of the island.

Non-indigenous children from the island were evacuated. To avoid the bombing, missionary Margaret Somerville led 95 indigenous children from the island's orphanage, part of the Croker Island Mission, on a journey that saw the party arrive on the Australian mainland. Travelling a distance overland, they boarding a train through central Australia, arriving in Sydney, New South Wales. Over forty-four days, the group covered .

The period is considered part of the \"Stolen Generations\" events.\n\nThe traditional custodians of Croker Island, the Yarmirr people, filed a claim over the sea surrounding Croker Island. The case, \"Yarmirr v Northern Territory\", was settled in the High Court of Australia on 11 October 2001. The case established that the Yarmirr people do have native title of the sea and sea-bed, however common law rights of fishing and navigation mean that only non-exclusive native title can exist over the sea.\n\nCroker Island was severely damaged by Cyclone Ingrid in March 2005.\n\nA cull of feral horses was undertaken in 2015.\n"}

He was the ninth federal official on whom Articles of Impeachment were served, and only the third to be convicted and removed from office.\n\nBorn in Carbondale, Pennsylvania, of James Archbald and Sarah Augusta Frothingham Archbald (born 1805), Archbald attended Yale University, graduating with an Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1871. He read law in 1873, and was admitted to the bar, entering private practice until 1884. That year, Archbald was appointed as a Judge of the Lackawanna County (45th Judicial District) Court of Common Pleas. In 1888, Archbald became President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas for Lackawanna County in 1888.\n\nArchbald received a recess appointment from President William McKinley on March 29, 1901, to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, to a new seat authorized by 31 Stat. 880. He was nominated to the same position by President Theodore Roosevelt on December 5, 1901. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 17, 1901, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on February 1, 1911, due to his elevation to the Commerce Court and Third Circuit.\n\nArchbald was nominated by President William Howard Taft on December 12, 1910, to the United States Commerce Court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and the United States Circuit Courts for the Third Circuit, to a new joint seat authorized by 36 Stat. 539. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 31, 1911, and received his commission the same day. On December 31, 1911, the Circuit Courts were abolished and he thereafter served on the Commerce Court and Court of Appeals. His service terminated on January 13, 1913, due to his impeachment, conviction and removal from office.\n\nAfter Wrisley Brown investigated charges that Judge Archbald bought coal lands at cheap prices for his personal benefit from railroads and real estate interests involved in litigation before his federal court, and also took a European trip in 1910 paid for by those frequent litigants, the House Judiciary Committee recommended to the United States House of Representatives that he be impeached. The railroads alleged to be shaken down included the Erie Railroad, Lehigh Railroad and the Reading Railroad.\n\nThe United States House of Representatives voted to send 13 articles of impeachment against Archbald to the U.S. Senate, by a vote of 223 to 1 on July 13, 1912; only Scranton's U.S. Congressman, John R. Farr, who sat on the Committee, voted in Archbald's favor. Articles I, II, III and VI alleged that Archbald had entered into agreements with litigants at a substantial benefit to himself, Article IV alleged a wrongful communication with litigants, Articles V, VII, VIII, IX and X alleged that he had improperly solicited and accepted gifts from litigants, Article XI alleged he had improperly solicited and accepted gifts from attorneys, Article XII alleged he allowed corrupt practices during jury selection and Article XIII alleged a general charge of bringing the judiciary into disrepute.\n\nOn July 16, 1912, the Senate began Archbald's trial. Judge Archbald took the witness stand in his own defense on January 6, 1913, claiming that the gifts and favorable deals were the result of longstanding friendships, and his wife also testified for the defense. The Senate convicted him of five of the 13 articles on January 13, 1913.\n\nThe exact voting division on each article is as follows:\n\nArchbald was convicted on Articles I, III, IV, V and XIII and was accordingly removed from office (Article II gained a majority of votes, but not the two-thirds necessary under the U.S. Constitution to convict), and the Senate subsequently voted, by 39 to 35, to order that Archbald be forever disqualified from holding any office under the United States. Pennsylvania's two Republican Senators, Boies Penrose of Philadelphia, and George T. Oliver of Pittsburgh, had voted against impeachment and lifetime disqualification.\n\nDespite the outcome, Archbald continued to declare his innocence. \"I have always known that I have done no wrong and the vote of no one makes it otherwise,\" he said before leaving for Scranton with his family. \"Judge Archbald came as near being an ideal common pleas judge as one can hope to find,\" one judicial colleague said upon his death. Lawyers eulogized him as a \"discriminating practitioner\" whose influence \"made a deeper impression than any other judge in the history\" of Lackawanna County.\n\nArchbald died on August 19, 1926, in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.\n\n"}

Offiah was inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame in 2013. He scored over 500 tries during his rugby league career, making him the third highest try scorer (and top try-scoring English player) of all time, and now features in a statue of great rugby league players outside Wembley Stadium.\n\nHe was a Great Britain and England national representative winger, and due to his running speed he was nicknamed \"Chariots\" Offiah after the film \"Chariots of Fire\". Offiah played for English clubs Widnes, Wigan, the , and the Salford City Reds, and in Australia for Sydney's Eastern Suburbs and St. George clubs.\n\nSince retiring Offiah has appeared on several reality TV shows.\n\nOffiah was born in London to Nigerian parents of Igbo origin, and attended Woolverstone Hall School near Ipswich, Suffolk, where he represented the school at fencing and played rugby union and cricket. He played cricket for the Essex 2nd XI but soon realised his main talent was for rugby union.\n\nHe first played club-level rugby union for Ipswich RFC and Rosslyn Park. After starring on the rugby sevens circuit and for the Barbarians, there was talk of an England future for Offiah.\n\nOffiah was spotted by Widnes coach Doug Laughton playing in the Middlesex Sevens, and was signed by the club to play rugby league for the 1987–88 season. Alex Murphy had been interested in acquiring Offiah from rugby union, but the board of directors at St. Helens infamously referred to Offiah as an \"uncoordinated clown\" and the interest was not followed up with action. Within months, he became the most talked about winger since Billy Boston for his lightning speed and try scoring, and it was at Widnes where he forged his reputation as a devastating winger, helping the team win both the Championship and Premiership. He ended his début season with 42 tries, making him the league's top try scorer, and also breaking the club record held by Frank Myler for most tries scored in a season. He received the Man of Steel award for his efforts.\n\nHe was also rewarded with a place in the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia, where he played in all three Tests of the Ashes series which was lost to Australia. While on tour with the Lions, Offiah took part in a 100-metre match race at Wentworth Park in Sydney against Australian flyers Dale Shearer and John Ferguson (Ferguson replaced Greg Alexander who was forced to withdraw through injury). Confirming his standing as the fastest player in rugby league, Offiah easily won the race from Shearer and Ferguson.\n\nIn the 1988–89 season, Widnes won the Championship and Premiership for the second successive year, and Offiah was once again the league's top try scorer with 58 tries in 41 games. He played in Widnes' 6–12 defeat by Wigan in the 1988–89 John Player Special Trophy final Burnden Park in Bolton.\n\nHe then spent the summer in Australia playing for Eastern Suburbs. He scored a try on his NSWRL début against Western Suburbs, and went on to score nine tries in 12 games for the club before returning to Widnes a feat only surpassed by Steven Nolan.\n\nDuring the 1989–90 season, Offiah played for Widnes on the wing in their 1989 World Club Challenge victory against the visiting Canberra Raiders. Offiah scored a try in Widnes' 24–18 victory over Salford in the 1990 Lancashire Cup final.\n\nIn 1991, Offiah had a second spell in Australia, this time playing for St George Dragons. He scored 11 tries in 14 games, including a hat trick against his former club, Eastern Suburbs.\n\nOver four seasons at Widnes Offiah scored a total of 181 tries in 145 games.\n\nOffiah joined Wigan in January 1992 for a world record fee of £440,000 (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £900,300 in 2013). This figure remained a record for a total cash transfer until Wigan beat their own record, paying £450,000 for Stuart Fielden from the Bradford Bulls in 2006.\n\nPlaying in his regular left wing position, Offiah formed a devastating partnership with Gene Miles in his first season at Wigan scoring 30 tries in just 15 games including setting a new club record of ten in a single match against Leeds in the Premiership semi-final in May.\n\nOffiah played in Wigan's 5–4 victory over St Helens in the 1992 RFL Lancashire Cup Final at Knowsley Road.\n\nHe played in a 15–8 victory over Bradford Northern in the 1992–93 Regal Trophy Final at Elland Road, played in the 2–33 defeat by Castleford in the 1993–94 Regal Trophy Final at Headingley, and scored a try in the 40–10 victory over Warrington in the 1994–95 Regal Trophy Final at Alfred McAlpine Stadium, and played in the 25–16 victory over St Helens in the 1995–96 Regal Trophy Final.\n\nHe was selected to go on the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand. Before the match against the Parramatta Eels, Offiah had a 100-metre race against Eels winger Lee Oudenryn. Offiah appeared to slip slightly at the start and Oudenryn won by half a yard, though rumours quickly spread that Offiah had tanked to allow Lions team mates to collect after they had allegedly backed the bookies' outsider Oudenryn to win.\n\nDuring the 1992–93 season Offiah played on the wing for defending RFL champions Wigan in the 1992 World Club Challenge against the visiting Brisbane Broncos. A week before the WCC, Offiah had played on the wing for Great Britain in the World Cup Final against Australia at Wembley in front of an international rugby league record crowd of 73,631 fans.\n\nOffiah played in four Challenge Cup wins, five Championship teams, three Regal Trophy wins and one Lancashire County Cup victory. He was twice man of the match winning the Lance Todd Trophy at Wembley. His 90-metre solo try in the 1994 Challenge Cup Final win over Leeds is remembered as one of the finest ever seen in a final, but he made a habit of such runs during his career, scoring a similar try just weeks before against Castleford. After the 1993–94 season Offiah travelled with defending champions Wigan to Brisbane, playing on the wing in their 1994 World Club Challenge victory over Australian premiers, the Brisbane Broncos.\n\nIn 1995, Offiah's life story, a 30-minute documentary was produced and directed by Pogus Caesar for Carlton TV UK as part of the \"Respect\" series. Offiah was selected to play for England in the 1995 World Cup Final on the wing, but Australia won the match and retained the Cup.\n\nOffiah jointly holds the record for the most tries scored in a match for the England national rugby league team.\n\nOffiah made a total of 158 appearances for Wigan with another single appearance as a substitute. He scored more than a try a game, crossing the line 186 times. He also managed a goal and three drop goals thus scoring a grand total of 749 points for the club. He left the club in 1996 to return to the capital to play for London Broncos, but sent an open letter to the Wigan Observer thanking fans and the club for his time there.\n\nWhen rugby league made the switch to summer rugby in 1996, Offiah played in only ten games before moving to the . He played for London in their 1999 Challenge Cup Final defeat against Leeds. In total, he scored 24 tries in 48 games for the club.\n\nIn 1996, after rugby union had officially allowed professionalism, Offiah signed for Bedford Blues, and had a brief spell there while also playing for the London Broncos. He played 14 games for the club, scoring 10 tries.\n\nAfter the London Broncos he moved to Salford City Reds for the 2000 Super League V, staying for two seasons, playing 45 games and scoring 23 tries.\n\nHe finished his career in 2001-02 playing rugby union for London Wasps, who were coached by his former Wigan team-mate Shaun Edwards. He played in eight games for the club, scoring five tries.\n\nHe was awarded an MBE in the 1997 New Year Honours.\n\nIn 2004 Offiah was one of the celebrities who took part in the first series of the BBC One show \"Strictly Come Dancing\", reaching fourth place with his partner Erin Boag. In 2005, alongside Natasha Kaplinsky, he hosted the one-off special, \"Strictly African Dancing\".\n\nIn 2006 he appeared on a Reality TV special of \"The Weakest Link\", winning £10,050 and splitting the winnings with Danniella Westbrook. Offiah won Celebrity come Dine With Me in 2011 which was a Rugby World Cup special. Offiah beat Victor Ubogo, Kieran Bracken and Gareth Chilcott. Offiah has also appeared on BBC quiz show \"Pointless\", firstly with Chris Kamara in 2012, where they were eliminated in the first round, the second time in 2013 with cricketer Philip Tufnell where they won the cash prize by getting a Pointless answer in the final round. Offiah donated his £1,250 prize to the Joining Jack Charity. In 2014, he was a contestant on Splash!, and was the fourth to be eliminated from the competition. In 2015, he appeared with his son Tyler on \"Big Star's Little Star\" where they won £11,000 for charity. In 2015, Offiah took part on \"All Star Mr & Mrs\" with his partner Virginia.\n\nOffiah worked as a pundit for Sky Sports rugby from 2008 until 2013. He was a regular studio guest during the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, and presented a weekly Super League round up on Sky Sports News. He has worked as an agent for several rugby players including Richie Myler and Kyle Eastmond. Offiah has also appeared several times on the TV show \"A Question Of Sport\". In January 2018, Offiah participated in And They're Off! in aid of Sport Relief.\n\nOffiah is part of the Rugby League Monument that sits outside Wembley Stadium, his bronze likeness depicting his try celebration from the 1994 Challenge Cup final.\n\nOffiah has two sons, Tyler (born 29 June 2006) and Phoenix (born 24 September 2009) with his wife, model and photographer Virginia Offiah and lives in Ealing, West London.\n\n"}
{"id": "1814391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814391", "title": "Kiswah", "text": "Kiswah\n\nKiswah (, \"kiswat al-ka'bah\") is the cloth that covers the Kaaba in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is draped annually on the 9th day of the month of Dhu al-Hijjah, the day pilgrims leave for the plains of Mount Arafat during the Hajj. The term \"kiswah\" is Arabic for 'pall', the cloth draped over a casket.\n\nEvery year, the old Kiswa is removed, cut into small pieces, and given to certain individuals, visiting foreign Muslim dignitaries and organizations. Some of them sell their share as souvenirs of the Hajj. In earlier times, Umar bin al-Khattab would cut it into pieces and distribute them among pilgrims who used them as shelter from the heat of Mecca. \n\nThe present cost of making the kiswa amounts to SAR 17,000,000 (~4,532,951.01 USD). The cover is 658m and is made of 670 kg of silk. The embroidery contains 15 kg of gold threads. It consists of 47 pieces of cloth and each piece is 14m long and 101 cm wide. The kiswa is wrapped around the Kaaba and fixed to its base with copper rings. The manually designed embroidery of the Quranic verses are slowly being aided by computers, thus increasing the speed of production.\n\nKing Tubba Abu Karab As'ad of the Himyarite Kingdom clothed Kaaba for the first time, during the rule of the Jurhum tribe of Mecca.\n\nMuhammad and the Muslims in Mecca did not participate in the draping of the Kaaba until the conquest of the city at 630 AD (7 AH), as the ruling tribe, Quraish, did not allow them to do so. When Mecca was taken by the Muslims, they decided to leave the Kiswah as it was until a woman lighting incense in the Kaaba accidentally set fire to the Kiswah. Muhammad then draped it with a white Yemeni cloth.\n\nMany notable Kings have had their share of ruling over the Kiswah. Muawiyah I used to drape the Kaaba twice a year, along with the help of Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr, and Abd al-Malik. They brought the traditional silk covering into effect. \n\nAl-Nasir, the Abbasid King, established the current practise of dressing the Kaaba with only one Kiswah at a time, superseding the former custom of allowing old Kiswah to accumulate one over the other. When Al-Nasir performed Hajj in 160 AH, he saw that the accumulated Kiswah could cause damage to the Kaaba itself, and therefore decreed that only one Kiswah should drape the Kaaba at any one time. \n\nThe King Al-Ma'mun, draped the Kaaba three times a year, each time with a different colour: red on the eighth of Dhu al-Hijjah, white \"gabati\" on the first of Rajab, and another red brocade on the twenty-ninth of Ramadan. Later on, Al-Nasir draped the Kaaba with green; both he and Al-Ma'mun disagreed on the frequent colour changes and switched to black, the only colour that has since been used for Kiswah. Black Kiswah supported by Tradition of Prophet to Mourning, some associated it with Battle of Karbala however saying of Prophet to wrap Kaaba with black cloth after 100 Years or before when events of Sorrow took start.\n\nFrom the time of the Ayyubids, precisely during the reign of as-Salih Ayyub, the Kiswah was manufactured in Egypt, with material sourced locally as well as from Sudan, India, and Iraq. The Amir al-Hajj (commander of the \"hajj\" caravan), who was directly designated by the sultans of the Mamluk, and later, Ottoman Empires, transported the Kiswah from Egypt to Mecca on an annual basis. The tradition continued until 1927, when its manufacture was moved to Saudi Arabia.\n\n"}

Bopearachchi dates Telephos between 75–70 BCE and places him in Gandhara, Senior to c. 60 BCE and suggests that he ruled in some parts of Pushkalavati or even further west.\n\nNothing is known about his dynastic connections. His few coins are rather singular and none of them bear his likeness, a rare occurrence in Indo-Greek coinage. Despite his Greek name, Telephos might therefore have been a ruler of Saka origin. His epithet was also unprecedented.\n\nThe silver of Telephos is rare and mostly consists of drachms; only a few tetradrachms are known. On the Greek side is a serpent-footed monster holding the stems of two plants, and on the Kharoshthi side two deities that probably should be identified with Helios and Selene, the sun and moon. Both types were unique in the area, though the monster would later appear on bronzes of Hippostratos.\n\nAn example of one of his bronzes is seen above, The obverse is the common type of sitting Zeus making a benediction gesture, whereas on the reverse is the unique type of a squatting man holding what on some specimens looks like a spear, on others a palm branch.\n\nTelephos used only two monograms, which he inherited from Maues.\n\nTelephos overstruck the earlier king Archebius.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1814401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814401", "title": "Negishi Line", "text": "Negishi Line\n\nThe is a Japanese railway line which connects Yokohama and Ōfuna stations. It is operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East). Freight trains also operate on this line, and it is essential for the southern Keihin region.\n\nThe Negishi Line does not exist as an independent service. Nearly all passenger trains are operated through onto the Keihin-Tōhoku Line past Yokohama to , , and ; as a result, the entire service between Ōmiya and Ōfuna is typically referred to as the on system maps and in-train station guides. Keihin-Tōhoku Line—Negishi Line trains are recognizable by their light blue stripe (the line's color on maps is also light blue).\n\nA few trains travel through to via the Yokohama Line.\n\nDuring the daytime, trains operate every 3 minutes between Yokohama and Sakuragichō stations (including Yokohama Line trains). Between Sakuragichō and Isogo, trains operate every 5 minutes, and Isogo and Ōfuna every 10 minutes.\n\nThe \"Hamakaiji\" limited express service also operates on the Negishi Line.\n\nFreight trains are a common sight on the Negishi Line. The following rail companies either link up to or use the Negishi Line for the purpose of transporting freight.\n\n\nThe oldest station on the line is , which was opened by the Japanese Government Railways on June 12, 1872 as the first railway terminal in Yokohama of the first railway line in Japan. The line was extended to on July 11, 1887; trains had to reverse direction at Yokohama via a switchback to continue their journey. This was alleviated by a bypass line between and which opened on August 1, 1898. The branch was named the Tōkaidō Main Line Branch Line on October 12, 1909.\n\nTakashimachō Station opened between Kanagawa and Yokohama on December 20, 1914 as the terminus of an electrified Keihin Line (the predecessor of today's Keihin-Tōhoku Line). On August 15, 1915, a new Yokohama Station opened, absorbing nearby Takashimachō and becoming the new terminus of the line. The old Yokohama station was renamed and the Sakuragichō – Hodogaya bypass closed. Keihin Line service was extended to Sakuragichō on December 30, 1915 when freight service ceased on the branch.\n\nThe line was planned to be extended to Ōfuna, and in 1920 the Government Railways decided that the extension route would be parallel to the Ōoka River and then turn to Hodogaya. From Hodogaya to Ōfuna, additional tracks would be added to the existing Tōkaidō Main Line. However, this plan was scrapped after the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923. Later, the planned extension was revived with a completely different route: \"The railway from Sakuragichō in Kanagawa Prefecture to \" was added to the list of railways to be built in the Railway Construction Act on March 31, 1937. This provision was the basis for the construction of the present-day Negishi Line.\n\nYokohama Station moved on October 15, 1928; between then and January 26, 1930, temporary platforms for the Keihin Line were provided on either side of the station.\n\nOn May 19, 1964, the line was extended to . The line was renamed the Negishi Line after one of the new stations. The Takashima freight line opened on June 1 that year and freight service returned to the line after a nearly 50-year absence. 103 series trains were introduced to the line in October 1965.\n\nThe line was extended from Isogo to on March 17, 1970. The final section between Yōkōdai and opened on April 9, 1973; On October 1 that year, freight service commenced between Ōfuna and Isogo.\n\nFreight services between Ōfuna and Isogo ceased on February 1, 1984; three days prior to this, the line adopted Automatic Train Control. On April 1, 1987 the Japanese National Railways were privatized, with ownership of the Negishi Line passing to JR East; JR Freight took over freight services on the line.\n\nSome trains began operating through onto the Yokosuka Line on March 15, 2008.\nThe Sakuragichō train fire occurred on April 24, 1951.\n\nOn May 20, 1970 a 103 series train derailed between and Yōkōdai, injuring two people.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1814410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814410", "title": "Coulomb collision", "text": "Coulomb collision\n\nA Coulomb collision is a binary elastic collision between two charged particles interacting through their own electric field. As with any inverse-square law, the resulting trajectories of the colliding particles is a hyperbolic Keplerian orbit. This type of collision is common in plasmas where the typical kinetic energy of the particles is too large to produce a significant deviation from the initial trajectories of the colliding particles, and the cumulative effect of many collisions is considered instead.\n\nIn a plasma a Coulomb collision rarely results in a large deflection. The cumulative effect of the many small angle collisions, however, is often larger than the effect of the few large angle collisions that occur, so it is instructive to consider the collision dynamics in the limit of small deflections.\n\nWe can consider an electron of charge formula_1 and mass formula_2 passing a stationary ion of charge formula_3 and much larger mass at a distance formula_4 with a speed formula_5. The perpendicular force is formula_6 at the closest approach and the duration of the encounter is about formula_7. The product of these expressions divided by the mass is the change in perpendicular velocity:\n\nNote that the deflection angle is proportional to formula_9. Fast particles are \"slippery\" and thus dominate many transport processes. The efficiency of velocity-matched interactions is also the reason that fusion products tend to heat the electrons rather than (as would be desirable) the ions. If an electric field is present, the faster electrons feel less drag and become even faster in a \"run-away\" process.\n\nIn passing through a field of ions with density formula_10, an electron will have many such encounters simultaneously, with various impact parameters (distance to the ion) and directions. The cumulative effect can be described as a diffusion of the perpendicular momentum. The corresponding diffusion constant is found by integrating the squares of the individual changes in momentum. The rate of collisions with impact parameter between formula_4 and formula_12 is formula_13, so the diffusion constant is given by\n\nThe integral of formula_15 thus yields the logarithm of the ratio of the upper and lower cut-offs. This number is known as the Coulomb logarithm and is designated by either formula_16 or formula_17. It is the factor by which small-angle collisions are more effective than large-angle collisions. For many plasmas of interest it takes on values between formula_18 and formula_19. (For convenient formulas, see pages 34 and 35 of the \"NRL Plasma formulary\".) The limits of the impact parameter integral are not sharp, but are uncertain by factors on the order of unity, leading to theoretical uncertainties on the order of formula_20. For this reason it is often justified to simply take the convenient choice formula_21. The analysis here yields the scalings and orders of magnitude.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1814421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814421", "title": "Audible (store)", "text": "Audible (store)\n\nAudible is a seller and producer of spoken audio entertainment, information, and educational programming on the Internet. Audible sells digital audiobooks, radio and TV programs, and audio versions of magazines and newspapers. Through its production arm, Audible Studios, Audible has also become the world's largest producer of downloadable audiobooks. Audible's content is usually only accessible through special proprietary closed software, including unauthorized-playback prevention by means of an Amazon account. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw people in several countries confined to their homes, Audible made many children's and classic titles free to access via its website, with no sign-in required.\n\nOn January 31, 2008, Amazon.com announced it would buy Audible for about $300 million. The deal closed in March 2008 and Audible became a subsidiary of Amazon. The company is based in Newark, New Jersey, and is expanding its presence in the city with the creation of a new technology center, called the Innovation Cathedral, located in a former church. Audible is the United States' largest audio book producer and retailer.\n\nIn January 1995, Audible introduced the first production-volume digital audio player almost six years before the introduction of the iPod. It only supported playback of digital audio in Audible's proprietary, low-bitrate .aa format that could be downloaded from Audible.com. The first player had about 4MB of memory, which is about two hours of .aa format audio. Audible holds a number of patents in this device area.\n\nOn October 24, 1999, Audible suffered a setback when its CEO at the time, Andrew J. Huffman, died of an apparent heart attack. Development proceeded, however, leading to Audible licensing the ACELP codec for its level 3 quality downloads in 2000.\n\nAudible scored a coup in 2003 when it made an exclusive deal with Apple to provide their catalog of books on the iTunes Music Store. Books purchased on iTunes would have a .m4b extension (a variation on MP4) and would contain AAC audio covered by Apple's FairPlay Digital Rights Management.\n\nAudible's success began to increase interest in the profile of Audible's founder, Don Katz. Consequently, he had his profile highlighted by AudioFile magazine in early 2003, was called upon to give a recorded talk on IT Conversations in May 2005 about the early history of Audible, and was tapped to deliver the keynote address at the Podcast Expo in November 2005.\n\nAudible launched Audible Air in 2005, software that made it possible to download (copy-controlled) audio books over the air - wirelessly and directly to devices such as a smartphones or PDAs. This eliminated the need for the intermediate step of downloading copy-controlled audio books first to a computer in order to then transfer it to Palm OS, Windows Mobile, and Symbian Mobile devices. Audible Air content would update automatically, downloading chapters as required that would then delete themselves after they had been listened to. Interest in Audible and its founder would continue to attract attention as Don Katz was featured in the March 2006 issue of \"Business 2.0\".\n\nIn April 2008, Audible began producing exclusive science fiction and fantasy audiobooks under its \"Audible Frontiers\" imprint. At launch 25 titles were released. In 2008, Amazon bought the company for $300 million.\n\nAudible continued its publishing endeavors in May 2011, when it launched Audiobook Creation Exchange (ACX), an online rights marketplace and production platform that connects narrators, producers and rights holders in order to create new audiobooks. The platform has been so successful that in 2012, Audible reported it had received more titles from ACX than from its top three audio providers combined. In March 2012, Audible launched the A-List Collection, a series showcasing Hollywood stars including Claire Danes, Colin Firth, Anne Hathaway, Dustin Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson, Diane Keaton, Nicole Kidman, and Kate Winslet performing great works of literature. Firth's performance of Graham Greene's \"The End of the Affair\" was named Audiobook of the Year at the Audie Awards in 2013. Audible's efforts to make audiobook narration a mainstream art form extends to the narration workshops it offers at acting schools including Juilliard and Tisch School of the Arts; in 2013, the Audible's CEO speculated that the company was the largest single employer of actors in the New York area. In 2014, at Audible's headquarters' six recording studios, producers and voice actors create new audiobooks 16 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nTechnical innovation returned to center-state for the company in September 2012 when Audible launched Whispersync for Voice, an innovation that enables readers to switch seamlessly between reading a Kindle book and listening to the corresponding audiobook without losing their place. Along with Whispersync for Voice, Audible released Immersion Reading, a feature which highlights text on a Kindle book as the audiobook is narrated. It was also the focus in June 2015 when audiblebooks from Audible.com was made available on Amazon Echo, a voice command device from Amazon with functions including question answering, playing music and controlling smart devices.\n\nIn July 2016, Audible introduced Audible Channels, its exclusive version of podcasts.\n\nIn November 2017, Audible claimed its customers listened to over one billion hours of content during the year.\n\nIn 2020, during the outbreak of Covid-19, Audible removed subscriptions and offered its entire selection for free for as long as lockdowns occurred.\n\nAudible's content includes more than 200,000 audio programs from leading audiobook publishers, broadcasters, entertainers, magazine and newspaper publishers and business information providers. Content includes books of all genres, as well as radio shows (classic and current), speeches, interviews, stand-up comedy, and audio versions of periodicals such as \"The New York Times\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\".\n\nIn addition to the regular price charged for audiobooks, Audible offers subscriptions with the following benefits:\n\nAdditionally, some content—particularly political speeches, government hearings, content such as the 9/11 Report Speech, excerpts, and short stories from books—are available for free.\n\nOnce a customer has purchased a title on Audible, it remains in that customer's library and can be downloaded at any time, or the customer may listen to the file directly from the website, regardless of whether it has been downloaded before.\n\nAudible audio files are compatible with hundreds of audio players, PDAs, mobile phones and streaming media devices. Devices that do not have AudibleAir capability (allowing users to download content from their library directly into their devices) require a Windows PC or Macintosh to download the files. Additionally, titles can be played on the PC (using iTunes, Windows Media Player, or AudibleManager). Titles cannot be burned to CD with AudibleManager. According to Audible's website, they can be burned to CD using Apple's iTunes and some versions of Nero. (The DRM generally allows a title to be burned to CD once, although the resulting CDs can be played in any CD player and have no copy prevention.) Currently there is no support for Linux, although AudibleManager is known to work through Wine (though this is not officially supported by Audible).\n\nProspective buyers of media players can check the audible.com \"Device Center\" to verify whether the device will play .aa files, as well as play them at the desired level of audio fidelity. Audible players are available on Apple iPhones, iPods, Android, and Windows Phone devices.\n\nThe Audible App allows for the downloading and playing of audio books purchased via Audible.com and allows the user to store multiple titles for play on mobile devices.\n\nThe following qualities have been available from Audible. Currently, only the \"Format 4\" and \"Enhanced\" formats are available for download.\n\n\nAudible's .aa file format encapsulates sound encoded in either MP3 or the ACELP speech codec, but includes unauthorized-playback prevention by means of an Audible username and password, which can be used on up to four computers and three smartphones at a time. Licenses are available for schools and libraries.\n\nAudible's content can only be played on selected mobile devices. Its software does enable users to burn a limited number of CDs for unrestricted playback, resulting in CDs that can be copied or converted to unrestricted digital audio formats.\n\nBecause of the CD issue, Audible's use of digital rights management on its .aa format has earned it criticism. While multiple software products are capable of removing the \"Audible DRM \"protection by re-encoding in other formats, Audible has been quick to threaten the software makers with lawsuits for discussing or promoting this ability, as happened with River Past Corp and GoldWave Inc. Responses have varied, with River Past removing the capability from their software, and GoldWave retaining the capability, but censoring discussions about the ability in its support forums. But there are still many other software tools from non-US countries which easily bypass the DRM control of Audible by various methods, including sound recording, virtual CD burning, and even using a media plugin library once provided by Audible themselves. After Apple's abandonment of most DRM measures, Amazon's downloads ceasing to use it, Audible's DRM system is one of the few remaining in place.\n\nMany Audible listings displayed to non-U.S. customers are geo-blocked. According to Audible, this is because the publisher who has provided the title does not have the rights to distribute the file in a given region. When a user is logged in, titles that he or she cannot purchase will be hidden.\n\nThere were hopes that Amazon, after its purchase of Audible, would remove the DRM from its audiobook selection, in keeping with the current trend in the industry. Nevertheless, Audible's products continue to have DRM, similar to the policy of DRM-protecting their Kindle e-books, which have DRM that allows for a finite, yet undisclosed number of downloads at the discretion of the publisher, however Audible titles that are DRM free can be copied to the Kindle and made functional.\n\nAudible is able to offer DRM-free titles for content providers who wish to do so. FFmpeg 2.8.1+ is capable of playing Audible's .aa and .aax file formats natively.\n\nIn 2015, Audible hired Eric Nuzum, formerly VP of Programming at NPR, to create an original content team. In July 2016, Audible introduced Audible Channels, offering original audio series to its subscribers. Nuzum likened the approach to those followed by Netflix and HBO in creating original video series.\n\nOver two years, Audible produced a number of original series, before scaling back the initiative in August 2018.\n\nAudible's original series include:\n\nWhere Should We Begin?, a podcast that brings you inside relationship therapist Esther Perel's office as she sees anonymous couples in search of insight on everything from infidelity to sexlessness to grief. The couples include both heterosexual and same-sex couples. The first episode aired on Audible in May 2017, and became publicly available on iTunes on October 9, 2017. The series is hosted by Esther Perel. The Executive Producer is Jesse Baker. Where Should We Begin? received a 2018 Gracie Award.\n\nSincerely, X, a podcast featuring anonymous TED Talks, created as a co-production between TED and Audible. The anonymous speakers included a doctor who believed she killed a patient; a Silicon Valley executive who experienced a mental breakdown; a yoga instructor who unleashed pepper spray in a department store; and a woman in a violent marriage who invented a ritual that she believes saved her life. The series is hosted by June Cohen, created by Deron Triff, and executive produced by Deron Triff and Colin Campbell. The first episode aired on Audible on February 1, 2017, and became available publicly on iTunes on July 19, 2017. Sincerely X received a 2018 Gracie Award for the episode \"Rescued by Ritual.\"\n\nPonzi Supernova, an investigative podcast that offers an inside look at Bernie Madoff and his $65 billion ponzi scheme, based on previously unheard interviews with Madoff from prison, as well as other interviews. The series is hosted by journalist Steve Fishman, who spent more than 10 years on the reporting. The Executive Producer is Ellen Horne.\n\nWest Cork, a true-crime podcast, investigating an unsolved 1996 murder in West Cork, Ireland.

{"id": "1814423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814423", "title": "Adelaide Park Lands", "text": "Adelaide Park Lands\n\nThe Adelaide Park Lands are the figure-eight of land spanning both banks of the River Torrens between Hackney and Thebarton and separating the City of Adelaide from the surrounding suburbia of greater Metropolitan Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia. They were laid out by Colonel William Light in his design for the city, and originally consisted of \"exclusive of for a public cemetery\". One copy of Light's plan shows areas for a cemetery and a Post and Telegraph Store on West Tce, a small Government Domain and Barracks on the central part of North Tce, a hospital on East Tce, a Botanical Garden on the River Torrens west of North Adelaide, and a school and a storehouse southwest of North Adelaide.\n\nOver the years there has been constant encroachment on the park lands by the state government and others. Soon after their declaration in 1837, \"were lost to 'Government Reserves'\". In 1902, \"The Herald\" noted that a total area of had been taken from park lands. In 2018, the loss is about .\n\nThe part of the Park Lands not in the 'Government Reserves' have been managed and maintained by the Adelaide City Council since 1852, and since February 2007, the \"Adelaide Park Lands Authority\" has advised council and government.\n\nOn 7 November 2008 the Federal Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Peter Garrett, announced that the Adelaide Park Lands had been entered in the Australian National Heritage List as \"an enduring treasure for the people of South Australia and the nation as a whole\". In fact, large areas of the Adelaide Park Lands along the north side of the complete length of North Tce, and along the north side of Port Road from West Tce to the Thebarton Police Barracks, (in Parks 11, 12, 26 and 27), and also the rail reserves, (in Parks 25, 26 and 27), were excluded from the \"Adelaide Park Lands and City Layout National Heritage Place\" listing.\n\nAdelaide is a planned city, and the Adelaide Park Lands are an integral part of Colonel William Light's 1837 plan. Light chose a site spanning the River Torrens (known as Yatala by the local people), and planned the city to fit the topography of the landscape, \"on rising ground\".\n\nThe Emigration Regulations appearing in the \"South Australian Gazette and Colonial Register\" published in London on 18 June 1836 instructed that the site of the first town be divided into 1,000 sections of an acre each.\n\nIn early 1837, William Light proposed to the Resident Commissioner James Hurtle Fisher that the figure-eight of open space, which Light later referred to as \"Adelaide Park\", be reserved as \"Park grounds\". Light drew up a plan that included south of the River Torrens and north of the river. In addition, he included of city squares: Hindmarsh, Hurtle, Light, Whitmore and Wellington Squares (each comprising six acres), Victoria Square (eight acres), four one-acre Public Reserves (with frontages to Victoria Square), and for the Park Lands.\n\nAdelaide's characteristic geometrical grid pattern is not unique: apart from earlier precedents going back to ancient Greece, it follows part of a series of rules created by Spanish planners for their colonial cities, known as the \"Law of the Indies\". They included the grid pattern with a main thoroughfare, centred around a main square. There are many historical precedents for five squares, including Philadelphia in America, designed in 1682 by surveyor Thomas Holme. There are however no records showing that Light deliberately copied any cities or rules for planning.\n\nIn 1838 the Colonization Commissioners for South Australia authorised South Australia's Resident Commissioner to purchase the Adelaide Park Lands, and these instructions were carried out in South Australia in 1839.\n\nBy 1839 the Park Lands were threatened by extensive timber cutting, rubbish dumping, brick-making, quarrying, squatting, and grazing. To check this, a body of special constables was instituted on 9 October 1839 by George Gawler and Superintendent Henry Inman. Inman appointed Nick Boys Bull (c.1800-1846), formerly a police sub-inspector, as Keeper of the Park Lands. Bull led an initial team of six park rangers, most being convalescent migrants thrown on government support. This dropped to two by 1840, then back to four by June 1841. Pay and rations were provided by the police department.\n\nSince 1852, the areas of the Park Lands placed in the custodianship of the municipal corporation have been managed and maintained by the Adelaide City Council. Public use of the Park Lands was controlled by a ranger who patrolled the parks, regulating sporting and recreational activities in the parks and supervising the depasturing of stock grazing there.\n\nThe Park Lands saw development during the 19th Century, for example the Adelaide Botanic Garden, hospital, South Australian Institute, Adelaide Oval, Victoria Park Racecourse. Extensive felling of trees, quarrying and dumping of rubbish continued, which combined to give the Park Lands an unsightly appearance. In the late 19th century John Ednie Brown, the government's Conservator of Forests, was commissioned by the City Council to prepare a blueprint for the beautification of the Park Lands. Brown presented his Report in 1880, but it was not acted upon until the turn of the 20th century when A.W. Pelzer became the City Gardener. Major progress was made in planting and landscaping the Park Lands during his tenure (1899–1932) and further improvements such as creation of new gardens and boating lakes were carried under the authority of W.C.D. Veale, the Town Clerk (1947–1965).\n\nIn July 2007 the city centre and parklands were granted National Heritage Listing status. The first remarks on the assessor's report were: \"The Adelaide Park Lands and City Layout is a significant example of early colonial planning which has retained key elements of its historical layout for over one hundred and seventy years. The 1837 Adelaide Plan attributed to Colonel William Light and the establishment of Adelaide marks a significant turning point in the settlement of Australia.\"\n\nIn the 2010s, about 25% of the Park Lands are the location of government, public and cultural buildings. Of the remaining approximately 700 hectares, many parts have been sculpted into planned gardens and playing fields. Some of the remainder is remnant or regenerated Adelaide Plains grasslands or grassy woodlands, of which 230 hectares have been designated and developed by the city council as areas for native fauna and flora. Developments in the early 2000s focused on maintenance and upgrading of recreational facilities, and removal of remnant grasslands and open grassy woodlands, particularly through urbanisation and the Greening of Adelaide tree planting and replacement programs.\n\nIn the early 2000s there were proposals to redevelop Park16 (Victoria Park), with the construction of a grandstand to cater for the Clipsal 500 and horse racing events. Due to lobbying by local resident groups, the Adelaide Park Lands Preservation Association, the media and many residents of greater Adelaide, this plan was eventually rejected by the Adelaide City Council and subsequently no longer pursued by the South Australian Government.\n\nIn December 2006 the state government passed the \"Adelaide Park Lands Act 2005\", which established the Adelaide Park Lands Authority and a series of statutory protections for the Park Lands. At the time the Act was proclaimed, Premier Mike Rann announced that a major return of alienated Park Lands would be made at the western edge of the city. The area to be returned lies between Railway Terrace, Port Road and the railway lines.\n\nIn 2011 Rann unveiled the plans for the return to Park Lands of 5.5 hectares of land at the west end of Park 25, occupied since 1879 by the Thebarton Water Depot. The land, which was treeless grasslands prior to European settlement, was developed and landscaped with more than 23,000 trees and shrubs as an 'urban forest'. It features indigenous species including native pine. In 2017–2018, land at the east end of Park 25 has been used by the South Australian Cricket Association for the development of the Karen Rolton Oval and associated facilities including car parking.\n\nAlthough it is a single park, for management purposes the Adelaide City Council has used the last two digits of survey sections as labels to identify smaller areas within the Adelaide Park Lands. In some, but not all, cases, roadways crossing over the Park Lands coincide with the survey section boundaries that gave rise to council's numbering (from \"Park 1\" to \"Park 29\"). The numbering, which starts in the North Park Lands (at the Adelaide Golf Links), and increases clockwise around the perimeter, was applied in September 1882.\n\nSome of the parks are more commonly known by a commemorative name (e.g. Rymill Park), but others, such as Park 10, are still known mostly by their number. \nSince the Adelaide City Council drew up a Reconciliation Vision Statement in 1997, they committed to a dual naming project, working with Kaurna Warra Pintyanthi, a Kaurna language project run in collaboration with Kaurna advisors. The dual naming covers the city centre and North Adelaide, including the six public squares and Adelaide park lands. Erection of signs in each of the parks was completed on 30 June 2004, with some of the spellings being revised in the 2010s. Also at that time, the numbered parks that still had no English name were assigned one.\nVictoria Square, in the centre of Adelaide city, is now also known as \"Tarntanyangga\". All 29 Parks around the city have been assigned a Kaurna name, and the River Torrens is now also named \"Karrawirra Parri\". The renaming of 39 sites was finalised and endorsed by the council in 2012. The full list of square and park names, along with meanings and pronunciations, is available on the Council website.\n\nKaurna Park Name & translation: Pirltawardli \"possum place\" (Pirltawardli/Piltawodli - \"pilta\" = possum, and \"wodli\" = house or home.) 76 hectares. The name of the site has in the past been spelt Pilta-wodli or Piltawodlingga (in KWP’s New Spelling 2010, Pirltawardli and Pirltawardlingga).<ref name=pns2/04></ref>\n\nOf an irregular shape, Possum Park / Pirltawardli wraps around the western end of North Adelaide in a vaguely crescent or banana shape. The southern and western boundaries are provided by War Memorial Drive, with Park 27 (which includes Bonython Park on the other side. The eastern boundary, from south to north, is formed by Montefiore Rd, the western end of North Adelaide (i.e. Strangways Terrace, Mills Tce and Barton Tce West) and Jeffcott Rd. The northern boundary is formed by Park Tce. It Contains the Adelaide Golf Links.\nThe history of Park 1 is bound up with that of Park 27 and Bonython Park, after a succession of Protectors of Aborigines first set up a \"Native Location\", of which elements moved between the north and south sides of the River Torrens.\n\nBromley’s Camp, the first of these, was established in April 1837 on the south side of the river by Captain Walter Bromley, the second interim Protector. He initially pitched his tent in the vicinity of the old Adelaide Gaol, on land on or near the present Bonython Park (also known as the \"Aborigines Location\" and later as the \"Old Location\").\n\nAfter a few weeks, Bromley moved camp to the north side of the river at the request of the Kaurna people, to the site known as Piltawodli (later revised to Pirltawardli), meaning \"possum place\" and also known as the \"Aboriginal Location\". It was probably a campsite used by the Kaurna, and may have had some importance for ceremonies. This site is now within the area of the Par 3 golf course adjoining the North Adelaide Golf Links, and is marked by a memorial plaque at the carpark by the weir, erected on 26 May 2000.\n\nIn October 1838 two German missionaries, Christian Teichelmann and Clamor Schürmann (and later Samuel Klose) arrived, setting themselves first up at the \"Old Location\" on the southern side, studying the Kaurna language and teaching in that language. This was the first mission in South Australia. In December 1839 Schürmann opened a school, supported by Governor George Gawler, which taught only in the Kaurna language, teaching the children to read and write in their language.\n\nIn 1839 the school was moved across to the north side of the river to Pirtawardli. In August 1840, Klose took over the running of the school. The second interim Protector (1837–1839), William Wyatt was also involved in the running of the school and was a frequent visitor to Pirtawardli.\n\nHowever the whole site, including the school, was dismantled in July 1845, on the orders of Governor George Grey, who thought it best to take the children away from their parents, and a new \"Native School\" run by the government, which taught only in English, was established near what is now Kintore Avenue. (The Native School closed in 1851, with the remaining children taken to Poonindie Mission at Port Lincoln on the Eyre Peninsula).\n\nA few people continued to camp near the house of Klose, the only remaining missionary, at Pirltawardli. In 1846 the government build some brick sheds in part of this area, and also across the river behind the new Adelaide Gaol. One was for the \"Murray tribe\", who had moved to the area, and a smaller number of sheds for what was left of the \"Adelaide tribe\".\nPirltawardli is still of great significance to Kaurna people, as well as non-Indigenous South Australians. Nearly all of the recorded language and early written records of Kaurna culture stem from this place, documented by the missionaries, who also shared their views on race relations in the new colony. The linguistic work of Teichelmann and Schürmann there had far-reaching effects, influencing later missionaries to teach in local languages, aiding the work of linguists, and laying the foundations for the 21st-century language revival of the Kaurna and also indirectly helping in the revival of other languages, after other missionaries and linguists had followed their example with other local languages.\nApart from the missionaries, other Europeans such as William Wyatt, William Williams, William Cawthorne and Matthew Moorhouse wrote about the \"Adelaide Tribe\" in their memoirs.\n\nWilliam Williams was keeper of the Colonial Store at nearby Tininyawardli ( or Tinninyawodli), which was just south of where Strangways Terrace was built. He published a list of 377 Kaurna words, published in the \"Southern Australian\" on 15 May 1839 and republished in the \"South Australian Colonist\" in the following year.\n\nWilliam Cawthorne, a frequent visitor and close friend of Kadlitpina (\"Captain Jack\"), loved the Kaurna Palti \"corroboree\" and their material culture, and was responsible for recording many names of artefacts. His \"Rough Notes on the Manners and Customs of the Natives\", written in 1844, was published in the 1925-26 \"Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia (SA Branch)\".\n\nMoorhouse, Protector from 1839 until 1857, lived at Piltawodli and worked closely with the missionaries. There is only one remaining page of his diary, containing several Kaurna songlines not recorded elsewhere, but much information has been gleaned from his reports and official correspondence.\n\nPardipardinyilla 'swimming place' 17 hectares\nDenise Norton was the first South Australian to represent Australia at the Olympic or Commonwealth Games – in the sport of swimming.\n\nApproximately square, the park is bounded by Fitzroy Tce (to the north), Prospect Rd (to the east), Barton Tce West (to the south) and Jeffcott Rd (to the west).\n\nThe Park provides a range of formal and informal facilities for cricket, swimming, tennis and family picnics. The north-west corner of the Park contains the Adelaide Aquatic Centre, picnic facilities and the Bush Magic playground. The remainder of the Park includes sporting facilities, open space and vegetation (designed and semi-natural landscapes).\n\nKantarilla 'kandara root place' 3.3 hectares\n\nA small triangle bounded by Prospect Rd (west), Fitzroy Tce (north) and Main North Rd (east).\n\nContains open park.\n\nKangatilla 'kangatta berry place' 9.4 hectares\n\nApproximately pentagonal, bounded by O'Connell St (west), Main North Rd (north-west), Lefevre Rd (north-east and east) and Barton Tce East (south).\n\nContains open and wooded park, with SA Water facilities at the western end. The former Fitzroy Croquet Club was located in the northern corner of the Park, and there were two ovals in the middle of the Park. The main structure of the SA Water facilities is a State Heritage-listed earth-covered reservoir, dating from the 1870s, that stores and supplies water to Adelaide. Associated with this are a two-storey red brick pumping station, a small brick pumping station \"heavily painted in Brunswick green\", and an electricity sub-station.\n\nNgampa Yarta 'ngampa root ground' In the late 1800s, Nobel Prize winners and University of Adelaide academics Sir William Henry Bragg and his son, Sir William Lawrence Bragg, lived nearby.\n\nOf irregular shape, the park is bounded by Robe Terrace (NE), Medindie Road (SE), Lefevre Road (W) and Main North Road (NW).\n\nContains two small ovals, surrounded by wooded park.

There are three main paddocks, four feeding yards, five horse troughs, and a number of sandpits for the horses to roll in. There is a limit of 20 horses, and those licensed pay a weekly fee. (In 2005, the fee was $19.50 per week.) According to the adelaideparklands.com.au website, \"100,000 kg of horse manure is deposited by the resident horses on this park each year\".\n\nThe open areas are surrounded by woodland. There is a playground on the western boundary (Lefevre Tce), one of the three Glover Playgrounds originally built in 1920, which also contains BBQ facilities and wide lawn spaces. The eastern third contains assorted playing fields, changing rooms, tennis courts and netball courts. Wilderness School holds a licence for eight tennis courts (also marked for netball), one cricket oval, two cricket practice nets, and three hockey/softball ovals. In 2005, there was also a green-painted brick structure with a flat roof, erected in the late 1960s, which \"appears to have an undefined purpose and use\".\n\nKuntingga 'kunti root place' (Park 7)\n\nParngutilla 'barngutta root place' (Park 8)\n\nParks 7 and 8 are small and elongated parks, with a combined area of 4.7 hectares, separating the east end of lower North Adelaide from Gilberton, and contain heritage listed olive groves. They act effectively as an enlarged median strip, with the major ring route of Park Terrace (southbound) and Mann Road (northbound) traversing the perimeter of both parks.\n\nThese parks were one of the first sites for the (European settlers) plantings of olives, and are the only section of the Park Lands that have kept the same use since the Council took over formal care of the Park Lands in the 1860s. The olive plantation is listed as a State Heritage Place.\n\nTidlangga 'tidla root place' William Bundey (1826–1889) was the Mayor of Adelaide 1883-1886.\n\nA triangular shape, bounded by Mackinnon Parade (NE), Bundeys Road (S) and Hackney Road (W).\n\nContains assorted playing fields and changing rooms.

Planned parks such as these include:\n\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> North Terrace forms the southern boundary of these establishments.\n\nNow-demolished buildings/structures which were built on the Park Lands include:\n\nSince the Park Lands were set apart by William Light as part of his original 1837 Plan of the City of Adelaide, and intended by the city founders to be reserved as public walks in perpetuity, any development can be seen to go against the founding ambitions for Adelaide and be a source of controversy in the community.\n\nIn response to incessant pressure and erosion, there have been many defenders of the Adelaide Park Lands. In 1987 a public meeting was held, which resulted in the formation of the Adelaide Parklands Preservation Association Inc, (APPA), which later corrected its name to Adelaide Park Lands Preservation Association Inc. Examples of such pressure and erosion are listed on APPA's \"Hot Topics\" page.\n\nAn example of one such source of controversy is the Victoria Park racecourse and associated areas south-east of the city centre which have been used for motor racing events for short periods of each year. In 2008 these parts of the park lands were targeted for development, incurring opposition from members of the community. The proposed plans included construction of a permanent corporate facility to provide hospitality and spectator facilities to select groups at events such as the Adelaide 500 motor racing event.\n\nOn 30 August 2007 veteran Adelaide heritage consultant and conservation architect Ron Danvers said it was \"a myth\" that Adelaide's founding fathers created the parklands (sic) exclusively for open space, and that it was \"self-evident\" that Colonel William Light's 1837 plan of Adelaide envisaged development of facilities beyond the CBD. In a submission to the Adelaide City Council, Mr Danvers said the state Government's $55 million plan for a grandstand at Victoria Park for horse and motor racing was \"completely consistent with the founding principles for the city\". \"Under Light's direction, the intention to locate public facilities outside of the main street grid is beyond question\", he said in a report commissioned by developers KBR.\n\nSubsequently, numerous counter-arguments demonstrated the fallacies in those points of view, and the proposal was dropped.\n\n\n\n"}

Generally, a mantrik is supposed to derive his powers from the use of charms, mantras, spells and other methods. A Hindu mantrik is known to worship Kali and is often mentioned in the same breath as tantric, though there are subtle differences.\n\nA mantrik is one who chants to please a god or evil spirit for his benefit. Mantras are sacred chantings containing magical and mystical words. A mantrik is known for his use of sorcery and magic and can be called upon for the casting of spells and magic, divination, astrology and all aspects of sorcery. Mantriks are normally associated with the darker side of magic and its relevant practices.\n"}

He was Premier of South Australia from June to October 1892 and again from 1899 to 1901. He was a prominent member of the inaugural Parliament of Australia following Federation in 1901, and was the first Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives.\n\nHolder was born in Happy Valley, South Australia, the son of James Morecott Holder and his wife, Martha Breakspear Roby. He was educated at Pulteney Grammar School and St Peter's College, Adelaide before first becoming a teacher, schoolmaster, and Methodist preacher, and later the editor and proprietor of the Burra \"Record\"; he also wrote for the Adelaide \"Register\".\n\nHolder married Julia Maria Stephens in 1877. His wife proved to be a great boon to his career, providing political advice and serving as South Australian President of the influential Women's Christian Temperance Union.\n\nSpeculating that it contributed to his poor health, Holder had failed to seek suitable medical attention following an accident involving a mule in 1899.\n\nWith considerable experience as a Councillor and Town Clerk, and just five months after his election as mayor of the Corporate Town of Burra, Holder was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly in 1887 as the member for Burra, and soon gained a sound reputation in parliament. As a result, he served as Treasurer of South Australia from 1889–90 in the J. A. Cockburn ministry, and Leader of the Opposition from 1890–92. He again served as Opposition Leader in 1899. He sat on many royal commissions during his parliamentary career in South Australia, and his reasonableness and sincerity made him a very valuable committee man. In June 1891 he carried a vote of want of confidence in the Playford ministry, and took office as Premier and Treasurer. He had only a small majority and it was a time of great financial difficulties due to a severe drought and Holder was forced out as Premier after just four months.\n\nHolder then served as Commissioner of Public Works in Charles Kingston's government from 1893–94, followed by a third stint as Treasurer from 1894 until his re-election as Premier and Treasurer in late 1899. As Premier, his most notable innovation was to introduce one standard time zone throughout South Australia, while he also played a prominent role in the movement towards a federal union, and, as such, was a member of the convention that framed the Commonwealth constitution in 1897–98.\nHolder took over the liberal leadership from Charles Kingston and was again Premier, this time from 1899 to 1901. He was succeeded in both roles by John Jenkins. The Liberal and Democratic Union would not be formed until the 1906 election.\n\nAs Premier, Holder considered himself to be the logical choice for a ministerial position in the new federal cabinet, and was offered a cabinet position by William Lyne after Lyne was invited by the Governor-General, Lord Hopetoun to form a government and become the inaugural Prime Minister. Holder initially accepted, and was in Melbourne en route to Sydney to officially accept his ministry when he was convinced by Alfred Deakin to refuse Lyne and instead support Edmund Barton's claim to the premiership. Believing that Barton would invite him to join the ministry, Holder was embarrassed and angry when Barton instead chose Kingston. Nonetheless, Holder resigned as Premier to successfully contest the 1901 federal election for the Free Trade Party and entered the new federal parliament in the single statewide Division of South Australia. Elected Speaker of the House of Representatives, Holder was re-elected to parliament in the 1903 and 1906 elections in the Division of Wakefield, contesting as an independent candidate.\n\nKnighted in 1902, Holder served as Speaker until his death on 23 July 1909. A 14-hour parliamentary session had started the previous afternoon. At 5 am the House was in committee, but Holder was present, having been called to the chamber to receive the committee's report, and was seated on the front bench, next to the Minister for Home Affairs, George Fuller. During a rowdy exchange, he exclaimed \"Dreadful, dreadful!\", then slumped sideways in his seat. He was taken to his room, where a cerebral hemorrhage was diagnosed by three members with medical qualifications and a doctor from outside the house. He died at 4:18 pm that same day without having gained consciousness. He was given a state funeral in Adelaide.\n\nThe Canberra suburb of Holder was named in his honour when gazetted in 1970.\n\nOn 29 March 1877, he married Julia Maria Stephens. \nShe was president of the Women's Christian Temperance Union in South Australia, and a vice-president of the National Council of Women.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1814443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814443", "title": "Mercedes-Benz buses", "text": "Mercedes-Benz buses\n\nMercedes-Benz has been producing buses since 1895 in Mannheim in Germany. Since 1995, the brand of Mercedes-Benz buses and coaches is under the umbrella of EvoBus GmbH, belonging 100% to the Daimler AG.\n\nThe world's first motorised bus was built in Germany by Karl Benz in 1895, some years before Gottlieb Daimler also started to build and sell buses in Germany as well. By 1898 both Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler, then rivals, were exporting their buses to Wales and England. Soon Daimler products were sold in the British Empire in a partnership with the British company Milnes. Milnes-Daimler developed a double-decker in 1902 and provided a bus for the first motorised bus service in the United Kingdom the following year. Though the company met success in selling buses throughout the British Empire, the partnership between Daimler and Milnes had to be undone due to the First World War.\n\nDue to economic hardships in the early 1900s, Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft and Benz & Cie. merged into one company in 1926, two years after both companies signed an agreement of mutual interest. Thus, Daimler-Benz AG (also known as Mercedes-Benz) was formed. In the next year, the company presented its first combined bus range. By that time emphasis was given to diesel engines (as opposed to petrol engines) for commercial vehicles.\n\nIn 1951 Mercedes-Benz unveiled its first bus specifically designed for bus operation (and not derived from a lorry, as was the case of the other buses produced by the company until then) – the O6600 H. This 11-metre-long vehicle was equipped with a six-cylinder, transverse-mounted rear engine delivering 145 hp, a lower frame than its predecessors, and an electric gearshift system.\n\nIn 1954 Mercedes-Benz unveiled its first semi-integral bus – the O321 H. The semi-integral design meant a reduction in weight, improvements in stability and body resistance. The O321 H also was the first to feature coil springs in the front-axle suspension. This 9.2-metre-long vehicle (a 10.9-metre version was later unveiled) also featured a rear-mounted engine. The first version was available with an output of 110 hp, and a later optional 126-hp version was made available. More than 30,000 units of the O321 H complete bus and its platform were sold around the world, a mark which places it as the best-selling bus of its time and, until today, one of the most successful models by Mercedes-Benz.\n\nIn the year 1951, technicians from Daimler Benz, accompanied by Brazilian specialists, carried out studies to analyse the viability of producing vehicles in Brazil. Two years later, on 7 October 1953, Mercedes-Benz do Brasil was officially founded, having as its first president Alfred Jurzykowski. A plant was then built in São Bernardo do Campo (a city neighbour to São Paulo city) in São Paulo State. On 28 September 1956 the plant was inaugurated in the presence of the then President of Brazil, Juscelino Kubitschek. This date marks the birth of the Brazilian vehicle industry.\n\nUntil 1958 only lorries were produced in the Brazilian plant, and local body builders used lorry chassis to make buses. In 1958, the integral bus Mercedes-Benz O321 H also started to the local production, supplying the local market as well as the market of other South American countries (although some Latin-American operators also bought European-made Mercedes-Benz buses). For instance, 550 units of Brazilian-made O321 integral buses were exported to Argentina in 1961, and other 300 units were exported to Venezuela in 1965.\n\nIn 1963, a front-engine bus chassis was unveiled, based on the LP 321 lorry. New versions of this chassis as well as new versions of the O 321 integral bus were presented the following year. The first integral bus tailored to the Brazilian market was the O 326, a rear-engine coach unveiled in 1966. It featured the turbo-charged OM 326 engine delivering up to 200 hp. One year later, a new front-engine bus chassis was also unveiled – the LPO 344, also based on a lorry chassis.\n\nIn 1969 a new rural- and urban-service bus was presented by Mercedes-Benz do Brasil. Designated O 352, this integral bus was equipped with a direct-injection diesel engine. Two new front-engine chassis were presented that same year – the LPO 1113 and the LPO 1520.\n\nDuring the 1970s the plant in São Bernardo do Campo was being expanded to meet with the increasing demand for the production of commercial vehicles. By the end of that decade, Mercedes-Benz had produced more than 500,000 commercial vehicles in the Brazilian plant, about 4,000 of which were integral buses.\n\nIn 1970, the rear-engine OH 1313 and the front-engine OF 1313 bus chassis were unveiled. One year later, a new integral coach was unveiled – the O 362 – featuring a larger luggage compartment than its predecessor, the O 321. Yet another integral bus was presented by Mercedes-Benz do Brasil – the O 355 – in 1974. The OH 1517 rear-engine chassis was also presented that year. One year after the first three-axle bus was built in Brazil (based on the Mercedes-Benz LPO 1113 front-engine chassis) made its debut in 1977, the new O 364 integral bus was presented by Mercedes-Benz do Brasil in two versions – one with a 130-hp engine, and the other with a 170-hp engine. Also in 1978 the production of the O 362 was discontinued, after more than 35,100 units were produced in Brazil.\n\nSince the demand for buses was growing by that time, a new plant was inaugurated in Campinas (a city in São Paulo State, Brazil), dedicated only for the production of buses. This plant was considered the biggest and most modern plant dedicated for the production of buses in the Western World. Meanwhile, the plant in São Bernardo do Campo was still being expanded.\n\nIn 1984 two new integral bus range were presented by Mercedes-Benz do Brasil. One of them was O 370 coach range, available in two- and three-axle versions. It was the first coach range produced by Mercedes-Benz do Brasil fitted with air suspension as standard. The other was the O 365 regular-service bus range. In 1987 the O 370 and O 365 bus ranges were succeeded by the O 371 range (made up by three coaches and three regular-service bus models).\n\nIn 1991 the company inaugurates the Centro de Desenvolvimento Tecnológico (or Technological Development Centre in English) in Brazil. This is, until today, the largest of its kind in Latin America. Some of the projects developed by the Centro de Desenvolvimento Tecnológico in Brazil were the natural gas engine M-447 hLAG, used in the natural-gas-powered Citaro, and the cost-effective improvements made in the Axor truck worldwide.\n\nIn 1994, Mercedes-Benz do Brasil presented the O 400 integral bus range, which included one standardised city bus, four coaches and the O 400 UPA articulated bus – the first articulated bus produced by Mercedes-Benz in Brazil, which came into production only in 1995. This vehicle featured an electronic-managed articulation developed by the company. In that same year, Mercedes-Benz reached an 85%-share in the commercial vehicles market in Brazil. In the following year, Mercedes-Benz do Brasil received the ISO 9001 and the VBA 6.1 certifications.\n\nIn 1996 a new version of the O 371 integral bus for regular-service operation was presented. However, months later Mercedes-Benz announced the end of integral bus production in Brazil. A statement was made in which the company announced it would henceforth focus on the production and development of bus chassis and platforms, and so it occurred. Bus production was relocated in the São Bernardo do Campo plant in 2000, when the Campinas industrial complex was dedicated for activities related to training and overseeing the dealership network in Brazil, parts and accessories distribution and technical assistance.\n\nIn 2006 DaimlerChrysler do Brasil unveiled two new articulated modular bus chassis – the O 500 MA (raised floor) and the O 500 UA (low-floor). Both are equipped with a six-cylinder-rear-mounted engine delivering 360 hp as standard. Units of the O 500 articulated bus range were purchased to operate in the BRT systems of Curitiba, São Paulo, Santiago de Chile (Transantiago) and Bogotá (Transmilenio).\n\nNowadays (2014), under the umbrella of Mercedes-Benz do Brasil Ltda., the bus chassis produced by Mercedes-Benz in Brazil supply the Brazilian market and are exported for countries in the Americas, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Amongst the buses produced by Mercedes-Benz in Brazil are the O 500 modular bus chassis series, which includes chassis made for urban and rural applications (available in raised- and low-floor versions) as well as coach chassis, the OH rear-engine bus chassis series, the OF front-engine bus chassis series and the LO mini- and micro-bus chassis series.\n\nIn 1951 the then Daimler-Benz AG set up in Argentina its first factories outside Germany: one in the town of San Martín, near Buenos Aires, and another in González Catán on industrial suburbs. The San Martin plant was closed at the end of the 1950s.\n\nMercedes-Benz released updated local colectivo based on modified L 3500 truck chassis – LO3500, OP3500, LO311, LO312– with a separately manufactured body fitted at a later stage by different coach builders. Also, it is important to note that the LO312 was the first Mercedes-Benz bus front chassis manufactured in Argentina\n\nIn 1963 Mercedes built the 10,000th colectivo (model LO312), and continued with other models, such as LO1112, (120 HP), LA1112 4x4 (traction in all wheels) and the LO1114. Due to the family relationship with the truck, the Mercedes-Benz colectivos had a diesel engine with power transmitted to the rear axle by a five-speed constant-mesh gearbox.\n\nIn 1967, manufacture of the middle-distance buses of self-supporting platform O120 began. In 1968 the O120 was replaced by the model O140 with a 130-hp engine.\n\nWith the L 608D, in 1970 was made in the Virrey del Pino factory the bus version: the LO 608D (until mid-1980s) and the LFu 608 variant.\n\nIn 1977, mass production of chassis for buses and buses with power steering began. Manufacturing of the LO914 and the O170, the successor to the O140 model with the OM 352 A supercharged engine with 156 hp and reinforced axles and suspension, also started.\n\nIn 1979, the company began the production of the bus chassis, front model, OC 1214, using the OM 352 engine like the LO 1114 bus.\n\nIn 1981, with some success, the OH 1419 bus was introduced and made in Argentina.\n\nIn 1982, the company built the first bus powered by compressed natural gas (CNG) in Argentina and launched two new models: the front-engine OF 1114 (not available in Argentina, just for export markets only, like Perú) and the OF 1214, with a front engine. Also introduced was a new line of vehicles for urban transport of passengers, automatic transmission for the LO1114, the new front chassis and bus chassis rear engine OH 1314, with and without automatic transmission.\nSeries production of the LO 1114 with automatic gearbox began and joined the air brake system on the Mercedes-Benz model LO 1114.\n\nIn 1987, Mercedes-Benz Argentina revolutionized the public transportation of passengers by launching the new line of rear-engined front-side bus (the \"OH\"), which replaced traditional front motor buses. With also the OH 1318 and OH 1418.\n\nFor the first years of the 1990s, arrives the buses of the O-series likes the O 373 RSD (324 units built), the O 374 RSD (72 units built) and the O 400 RSD (61 units built) for the long-distance bus routes and also the OH 1522 (333 units built) and the OH 1526 (98 units built). All made in the factory of González Catán until 1995. In 1994, start the assembly of the OF 1620 with the 200HP diesel engine with 6606 units made and large used in the provinces like Santa Fe, Jujuy and others.\n\nFor the urban buses, the OHL series added with the production line in 1990 with this models: OH/OHL 1316, OH/OHL 1320 and the OH/OHL 1420 with success in the urban transport.\n\nIn 1997, the argentinian market receive the local-made OH 1521L-Sb, OH 1621 L and in 1999 OH 1721L-Sb.\n\nAfter the 2001 crisis, develops many \"colectivos\" like the OH 1115 and OH 1315 (except the case in 2002, when industrialized the production of the OH 1721, a bus with a 210HP engine), medium urban buses with a 150 HP engine. This models made and sold until 2008, replaced in 2009 by the new OH 1618L-Sb and the OH 1718, a local develop for Mercedes-Benz Argentina under the chassis of the OH 1618.\nThe OH 1618 is ready to meet the highest requirements on emissions, Euro 3, 4 and 5. Has the renowned Mercedes-Benz OM 904 LA Euro 3 of a high torque: 675 Nm, a power of 177 hp DIN. The engine electronic management and 3 valves per cylinder, with the optional Top Brake system to improve vehicle efficiency and durability of the brake system. Optionally provides two types of gearbox: automatic and mechanical.\nThe front and rear axles are developed, tested and manufactured by Mercedes-Benz, especially technology adopted and adapted to the needs of passenger transport: low velocity, starting and numerous arrests per kilometer, with extensive use of systems Brake and manageability of the unit.\n\nAlso in 2008, when the OF 1417 stopped the production and the OF 1418 are a popular chassis bus, Mercedes-Benz Argentina S.A. determine the assembly of the mentioned OF 1418 until 2015.\n\nToday it builds modern-style buses and several models of bus chassis and Mercedes-Benz Sprinter delivery vans, chassis cabs and minibuses with a large slice of them being exported to Germany. Mercedes-Benz commuter and touring buses are not necessarily up to European counterparts but robust enough to handle heavy urban usage and some of Argentina's rugged backcountry and extra long-distance travel. For 2012, was return the production of the Sprinter NCV3, the successor of the T1N with many Argentinian-made parts and it's exported to the Mercosur, South Africa and other markets.\n\nIn 2013, announced the assembly of the minibus LO 915 in the Virrey del Pino plant with the high floor rear engine (OH) chassis OH 1518 previously imported from Brazil the two models. Also, other models like the OF 1722 were nazionalizated for argentinian market.\n\nSince November 2015, announced the new local-made models, like the OH 1621 and OH 1721. All are involved in the Euro V emission standards, obligatory since January 2016.\nOther models under the Euro V standard are the OF 1519, OF 1621 and OF 1721 and OF 1724.\n\nDaimler AG is currently manufacturing buses and coaches under the Mercedes-Benz brand in Turkey. Mercedes-Benz Türk was established in Istanbul in 1967 as Otomarsan, and it started the production of the O 302 type buses in 1968.\n\nIn 1970, only two years after its foundation, the company started to export buses, over 12,600 buses being exported to date. In 1984, the company was appointed as the general representative of Mercedes-Benz in Turkey, added with new partners to the enterprise, and started a new investment necessary for production of trucks. In 1986, parallel to the growth potential of Turkey, the truck plant started production in Aksaray. In November 1990, the company name was changed to Mercedes-Benz Türk A.Ş.\n\nThe company is one of the biggest foreign direct investments in Turkey (with a total investment volume of €807 million) and employs more than 5.000 personnel. Due to increasing export activities, Mercedes-Benz Türk built a new bus plant in Hoşdere, Istanbul, which became active in December 1994.\n\nSince its foundation, Mercedes-Benz Türk has sold more than 75,000 buses (from Hoşdere only), 215,000 trucks and 1,000 midibuses from its own production, in addition to 20,000 cars since 1989, when the company started the importation of passenger cars. Mercedes-Benz Türk currently produces intercity (the Travego, Intouro and Tourismo) and municipality buses (the Conecto) at the Hoşdere, Istanbul plant, and light and heavy duty trucks (Actros, Axor, Atego and the Unimog) at the Aksaray plant.\n\nMercedes-Benz Türk is the first company in the Turkish primary automotive industry to get the ISO 9002 quality certificate, obtained in 1994 for the Aksaray plant, and ISO 9001 quality certificate, obtained in 1995 for the Davutpaşa, Istanbul and Hoşdere, Istanbul production plants.\n\nFurthermore, Mercedes-Benz Türk has the certificate ISO 14001 for environment management standards since May 2000 and the certificates ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 16949 since March 2002.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Verband Deutscher Verkehrsunternehmen (or German Association for Public Transport Operations in English) conducted a project of a highly standardised and specialised bus, in order to improve the quality, simplify the maintenance and reduce the production costs of buses in Germany – the VÖV-I. Based on the recommendations provided by the VDV, Mercedes-Benz unveiled the O305 regular-service bus in 1967. In 1973 the rural-service bus O307 was presented. It was based on the O305 and also conceived in line with the standards set by the VDV. In 1977, Mercedes-Benz presented a 17-metre-long articulated version of the O305 (the O305 G), featuring a rear-mounted engine.\n\nBy the end of the 1970s the project was improved and a VÖV-II standardised bus range was presented. Mercedes-Benz again took part in the project and in 1980 presented the \"S80\" standardised regular-service bus. After minor changes were made, the Mercedes-Benz S80 came into production in 1984 as the O405, succeeding the O305. In the following year, an articulated (O405 G) and a rural-service version (O407) were unveiled.\n\nIn 1995 Daimler-Benz Bus and Coach range and Kässbohrer Bus Division were combined to form the EvoBus GmbH. Both Mercedes-Benz and Setra continued to operate separately on the market for some time.\n\nOne year later EvoBus was formed, the first of a new bus range from Mercedes-Benz was presented – the Integro (O550) rural-service bus, later joined by a three-axle 15-metre version. Besides the Integro, EvoBus also presented the Mercedes-Benz O405 NÜL (twin-axle long low-floor rural-service bus), O405 NK (compact city bus) and the Innovisia (an improved version of the O404). The Innovisia was the first bus to be equipped with an ABC suspension system. Shortly after the Citaro urban-service low-floor bus was unveiled. It was the first urban bus equipped with CAN data bus.\n\nCoordinated production between Setra and Mercedes-Benz started in 1997. New versions of the Citaro low-floor bus were presented that year, including a 15-metre three-axle version and an 18-metre articulated version. In 1998 the new Mercedes-Benz Tourismo (O350) was presented in a super-high-deck version with three-axles, based on the O404 coach chassis. The O404 integral bus was succeeded by the Travego in 1999. The Travego was available either with a six-cylinder in-line engine (initially delivering 354 and 408 hp) or with a V8 engine (delivering 476 hp).\n\nIn the 17th edition of the Bus World exposition in Kortrijk (Belgium), Mercedes-Benz officially unveiled the Tourino – a 9,3-metre coach featuring automatic air suspension, disc brakes, ABS, EBS and ASR systems. There were two engine options (245 hp/279 hp), both six-cylinder rear-mounted engine.\n\nThe Citaro, Travego and Integro range were redeveloped by the end of 2005, and the CapaCity – a four-axle articulated low-floor bus 19.54-metre long – was unveiled in 2006. Also in 2006 the Tourismo was redeveloped, and a 14-metre version was presented. Amongst the innovations incorporated to the new Tourismo are the new engine output available (354 hp/408 hp/428 hp) and the new-generation transmissions available with EPS system.\n\nCurrently Mercedes-Benz concentrates the integral bus production in Germany and Turkey, and chassis production in Spain and Brazil. There are other manufacturing basis around the world, such as the ones in France and Argentina.\n\nA joint-venture between Mercedes-Benz and Brazilian coachbuilder Marcopolo resulted in the formation of Polomex. The company assembles and sells urban buses and coaches with Mercedes-Benz chassis and Marcopolo body in Mexico. The coach range includes the Multego, a luxury coach based on the Mercedes-Benz OC500 modular bus chassis. The body, produced by Marcopolo, features a design similar to that of Mercedes-Benz Travego.\n\nThe earliest cited alternative-drive bus sold by Mercedes-Benz is the O6600 T, a trolleybus based on the O6600 H diesel bus. In the early 1950s, 350 German-made Mercedes-Benz trolleybuses were exported to Argentina.\n\nNonetheless, Mercedes-Benz engaged in intensive research and development of alternative propulsion systems in the 1960s. In 1969 the brand presented the OE302 electric bus. Two years later, a natural-gas-fuelled version of the O305 was unveiled, and in 1975 the OE302 duo bus went into trial operation in Esslingen, Germany. A minibus operated on pure hydrogen was demonstrated in 1977. In 1978 the hybrid electric OE305 was presented. The same year Mercedes-Benz do Brasil presented the OF-1315 front engine natural-gas-fuelled bus chassis for the Brazilian market. Other five duo buses went into trial operation in Esslingen the following year, two of them in battery/trolley operation and the other three in diesel/trolley operation. Also in 1979, Daimler-Benz sent a German-built O305 trolleybus to be tested on the São Paulo trolleybus system, Brazil, then one of the most extensive trolleybus systems in the western world. The O305 GT trolleybus would go into production in 1981. Also in 1981 a methanol-fuelled O305 was unveiled.\n\nIn 1983 methanol-drive Mercedes-Benz buses were tested in São Paulo, Brazil. Some time later, 40 natural-gas-fuelled Mercedes-Benz O364 rear-engine integral buses went into experimental operation in that city. Two of them used a mixture of soy oil, ethanol and B-Diesel as fuel. In the following year Mercedes-Benz do Brasil unveil the OH-1315, a natural-gas-fuelled rear-engine bus chassis, and the O371 integral bus range for the Brazilian market, including a natural-gas integral urban bus and a trolleybus. In 1986 experiments were made in Europe with an articulated duo bus (diesel/electric) based on the O405. The O405 trolleybus was presented in that same year.\n\nIn 1984, a trial was carried out with a four O305 buses already in use in Auckland, New Zealand, with two powered by liquid petroleum gas and two powered by compressed natural gas (CNG). At the same time, two Volvo B10M buses were converted to run on methanol. All six, as well as a further 50 O303 and O305 buses, were all put onto CNG. Auckland City had a fleet of one hundred O303 buses and three hundred O305 buses.\n\nIn the 1990s three new natural-gas-powered models were unveiled by Mercedes-Benz: the O405 GN GNG low-floor articulated bus, which was Europe's first natural gas low-floor city bus; the O405 NG solo city bus and the O405 ÜNG for rural service. All models were fitted with the M-447 hG engine that was exported from Brazil.\n\nIn 1994 a prototype of a low-floor articulated duo bus based on the O405 – the O405 GNTD – was presented, featuring electric hub motors.\n\nIn 1996 the OH-1315 natural-gas bus chassis is succeeded by the OH-1621 LG, also natural-gas-powered. One year later, the OH-1621 LG was equipped with an electronic-managed engine as standard.\n\nIn 1997 Daimler-Benz presented its first fuel-cell bus, designated NEBUS (New Electric Bus), based on the O405 urban bus. It was the world's first fully operational fuel-cell-powered bus. Another fuel-cell-powered was developed later, based on the Citaro. Exemplars of the Citaro Fuel Cell bus are currently being tested in Europe, China and Australia.\n\nIn 1998, the Cito (a diesel-electric midibus) was unveiled, featuring the low-floor concept.\n\nIn 2000, Mercedes-Benz do Brasil delivered the first 56 model M-447 hLAG turbocharged natural gas engines to the city of Hannover in Germany fitted to specially-designed Citaro citybuses for EXPO 2000. Subsequently, this engine has sold in larger numbers compared to the previous M-447 hG engine, with over 600 ordered by Australian bus operators alone.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The use of sensors may be part of a package which can provide support for people with illnesses such as dementia, or people at risk of falling.\n\nMost telecare mitigates harm by reacting to untoward events and raising a help response quickly. Some telecare, such as safety confirmation and lifestyle monitoring have a preventive function in that a deterioration in the telecare user's wellbeing can be spotted at an early stage.\n\nTelecare is specifically different from telemedicine and telehealth. Telecare refers to the idea of enabling people to remain independent in their own homes by providing person-centred technologies to support the individual or their carers.\n\nMobile telecare is an emerging service where state of the art mobile devices with roaming SIMs are utilised to allow a client to go outside their home but still have a 24/7 telecare service available to support them. Typical devices that do this are such things as the Pebbell mobile GPS tracker.\n\nThe meaning and usage of the term 'telecare' has not yet settled into consistent use. In the UK it is grounded in the social care framework and focuses on the meaning described above. In other countries 'telecare' may be applied to the practice of healthcare at a distance.\n\nIn its simplest form, it can refer to a fixed or mobile telephone with a connection to a monitoring centre through which the user can raise an alarm. Technologically more advanced systems use sensors, whereby a range of potential risks can be monitored. These may include falls, as well as environmental changes in the home such as floods, fire and gas leaks. Carers of people with dementia may be alerted if the person leaves the house or other defined area. When a sensor is activated it sends a radio signal to a central unit in the user's home, which then automatically calls a 24-hour monitoring centre where trained operators can take appropriate action, whether it be contacting a local key holder, doctor or the emergency services.\n\nTelecare also comprises standalone telecare which does not send signals to a response centre but supports carers through providing local (in-house) alerts in a person's home to let the carer know when a person requires attention.\n\nIt is important to note that 'telecare' is not just a warning system if someone strays from home but is also preventative measure whereby people are brought back and kept in the community through regular communication.\nThere are now a large range of telecare services available with some of the most well known being the pendant alarm, mobile carephone system, pill dispenser, telephone prompt service the movement monitoring, fall detector and more. Multi-lingual telecare services have now been introduced opening the service up to a wider audience. All play a role in maintaining people's independence and allowing people to stay in their own homes.\n\nTechnological advances result in the possibility of promoting independence and for providing care from the social initiative sector, which now contemplates eCare, and navigation/positioning systems, such as GPS for people with dementia or other cognitive impairments.\n\nIn 2005 the UK's Department of Health published \"Building Telecare in England\" to coincide with the announcement of a grant to help encourage its take up by local councils with social care responsibilities.\n\nThe UK’s Department of Health’s Whole System Demonstrator (WSD) launched in May 2008. It is the largest randomised control trial of telehealth and telecare in the world, involving 6191 patients and 238 GP practices across three sites, Newham, Kent and Cornwall. The trials were evaluated by: City University London, University of Oxford, University of Manchester, Nuffield Trust, Imperial College London and London School of Economics.\n\nThe WSD headline findings after the telehealth trial, involving 3154 patients, included these outcomes:\n\n\nThe telecare findings were supposed to be published at some point in the future. In fact they have never surfaced. Some patients are still hopeful that telecare will lead to substantial improvements in the quality of services. The research showed that the telecare approach was not cost effective, with an incremental cost per QALY when added to usual care of £92,000.\n\nThe Government's Care Services minister, Paul Burstow, stated in 2012 that telehealth and telecare would be extended over the next five years (2012-2017) to reach three million people. This ambition was formally abandoned in November 2013. In September 2014 NHS England announced a replacement, but much lower profile, new “technology enabled care services” programme.\n\n\n"}

With her exceptional singing voice, at the age of seven she became one of the lead vocalists in the Bujumbura choir and performed in the local cathedral. She left Burundi for Zaire in 1975 and married in 1978. In 1980 she emigrated to Belgium with her two-year-old son. In 1985 she obtained a contract with BMG. Her second album, a 1994 release entitled \"Ya Pili\", was critically acclaimed.\n\nHer breakthrough came in 1996 with her widely popular album \"Sambolera\", which was sung in Swahili, Kirundi, and French. In 1997 she performed the song \"Sailing\" in a duet with Montserrat Caballé on the album \"Friends For Life\". She successfully used a blend between African rhythms and modern pop to create her own unique brand of music. One of her most popular songs is \"Sina Mali, Sina Deni\", a translated cover version of Stevie Wonder's song \"Free\".\n\nThe first album was released in 1992, sung in Swahili. But it is best known in France in 1995 with the tube Sambolera mali sound, a title of the second album, Ya Pili (The second). The third album is a compilation of old and new titles. Jeanne Moreau makes the clip illustrating her song Mama, where she talks about her mother, on her fourth album Ya ... . The texts of this album are in Swahili or Kirundi (for the chorus of the title Mama). The album also includes a cover of a piece by Gabonese musician Pierre Akendengué, Africa Obota, and a title of Stevie Wonder, Free that she renamed Sina mali, sina deni (I am neither rich nor indebted). Another piece pays tribute to Nelson Mandela, and a song calls for easing the embargo imposed on Burundi.\n\nIn January 2000, she sang at AccorHotels Arena (at the time Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy) with Sting and Cheb Mami. She remarries in 2006 with the Belgian car driver Jacky Ickx, and they settle in Monaco. In this marriage, she has had a son who now lives in Belgium.\n\nIn 2018, she was a jury member at the Cannes Film Festival, under the presidency of Cate Blanchett, alongside actresses Léa Seydoux and Kristen Stewart, director Ava DuVernay, actor Chang Chen and directors Robert Guédiguian, Denis Villeneuve and Andrey Zvyagintsev.\n\n\n"}

The former areas have more owner-occupied houses and are more middle-class.

Bottomley had been the MP for abolished Woolwich West before 1983. Labour's Clive Efford gained the seat in 1997, the first Eltham election in which Bottomley did not stand. Bottomley was standing instead for Worthing West, where he has remained the MP ever since.

Sargent and Neil Wallace based upon the theory of rational expectations, which posits that monetary policy cannot systematically manage the levels of output and employment in the economy.\n\nPrior to the work of Sargent and Wallace, macroeconomic models were largely based on the adaptive expectations assumption. Many economists found this unsatisfactory since it assumes that agents may repeatedly make systematic errors and can only revise their expectations in a backward-looking way. Under adaptive expectations, agents do not revise their expectations even if the government announces a policy that involves increasing money supply beyond its expected growth level. Revisions would only be made after the increase in the money supply has occurred, and even then agents would react only gradually. In each period that agents found their expectations of inflation to be wrong, a certain proportion of agents' forecasting error would be incorporated into their initial expectations. Therefore, equilibrium in the economy would only be converged upon and never reached. The government would be able to maintain employment above its natural level and easily manipulate the economy.\n\nThis behavior by agents is contrary to that which is assumed by much of economics. Economics has firm foundations in assumption of rationality, so the systematic errors made by agents in macroeconomic theory were considered unsatisfactory by Sargent and Wallace. More importantly, this behavior seemed inconsistent with the stagflation of the 1970s, when high inflation coincided with high unemployment, and attempts by policymakers to actively manage the economy in a Keynesian manner were largely counterproductive. When applying rational expectations within a macroeconomic framework, Sargent and Wallace produced the policy-ineffectiveness proposition, according to which the government could not successfully intervene in the economy if attempting to manipulate output. If the government employed monetary expansion in order to increase output, agents would foresee the effects, and wage and price expectations would be revised upwards accordingly. Real wages would remain constant and therefore so would output; no money illusion occurs. Only stochastic shocks to the economy can cause deviations in employment from its natural level.\n\nTaken at face value, the theory appeared to be a major blow to a substantial proportion of macroeconomics, particularly Keynesian economics. However, criticisms of the theory were quick to follow its publication.\n\nThe Sargent and Wallace model has been criticised by a wide range of economists. Some, like Milton Friedman, have questioned the validity of the rational expectations assumption. Sanford Grossman and Joseph Stiglitz argued that even if agents had the cognitive ability to form rational expectations, they would be unable to profit from the resultant information since their actions would then reveal their information to others. Therefore, agents would not expend the effort or money required to become informed and government policy would remain effective.\n\nThe New Keynesian economists Stanley Fischer (1977) and Edmund Phelps and John B. Taylor (1977) assumed that workers sign nominal wage contracts that last for more than one period, making wages \"sticky\". With this assumption the model shows government policy is fully effective since, although workers rationally expect the outcome of a change in policy, they are unable to respond to it as they are locked into expectations formed when they signed their wage contract. Not only is it possible for government policy to be used effectively, but its use is also desirable. The government is able to respond to stochastic shocks in the economy which agents are unable to react to, and so stabilise output and employment.\n\nThe Barro–Gordon model showed how the ability of government to manipulate output would lead to inflationary bias. The government would be able to cheat agents and force unemployment below its natural level but would not wish to do so. The role of government would therefore be limited to output stabilisation.\n\nSince it was possible to incorporate the rational expectations hypothesis into macroeconomic models whilst avoiding the stark conclusions that Sargent and Wallace reached, the policy-ineffectiveness proposition has had less of a lasting impact on macroeconomic reality than first may have been expected. In fact, Sargent himself admitted that macroeconomic policy could have nontrivial effects, even under the rational expectations assumption, in the preface to the 1987 edition of his textbook \"Dynamic Macroeconomic Theory\":\n\nDespite the criticisms, Anatole Kaletsky has described Sargent and Wallace's proposition as a significant contributor to the displacement of Keynesianism from its role as the leading economic theory guiding the governments of advanced nations.\n\nWhile the policy-ineffectiveness proposition has been debated, its validity can be defended on methodological grounds. To do so, one has to realize its conditional character. For new , countercyclical stimulation of aggregate demand through monetary policy instruments is neither possible nor beneficial \"if the assumptions of the theory hold\". \"If\" expectations are rational and \"if\" markets are characterized by completely flexible nominal quantities and \"if\" shocks are unforeseeable white noises, then macroeconomic systems can deviate from the equilibrium level only under contingencies (i.e. random shocks). However, no systematic countercyclical monetary policy can be built on these conditions, since even monetary policy makers cannot foresee these shocks hitting economies, so no planned response is possible. According to the common and traditional judgement, new classical macroeconomics brought the inefficiency of economic policy into the limelight. Moreover, these statements are always undermined by the fact that new classical assumptions are too far from life-world conditions to plausibly underlie the theorems. So, it has to be realized that the precise design of the assumptions underlying the policy-ineffectiveness proposition makes the most influential, though highly ignored and misunderstood, scientific development of new classical macroeconomics. New did not assert simply that activist economic policy (in a narrow sense: monetary policy) is ineffective. Robert Lucas and his followers drew the attention to \"the conditions under which this inefficiency probably emerges\".\n\n\n\n"}

A new constitution promulgated in 1990, following two military coups in 1987, abolished the \"national\" parliamentary seats elected by universal suffrage (which had comprised almost half the House of Representatives); all members henceforth were to be elected by enrolled voters on \"communal\" electoral roles that were limited to specific ethnic communities, each of which had an allocated number of seats in the House (37 indigenous Fijians, 27 Indo-Fijians, 1 Rotuman, and 5 General Electors (Europeans, Chinese, Banaban Islanders, and other minorities). The end to multiracial voting resulted in a trend towards intracommunal politics, and multiracial parties like the old Alliance Party of longtime Prime Minister Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara were therefore dissolved and replaced by parties representing principally a single ethnic group.\n\nRatu Mara had announced his intention not to contest the election that was to be held in 1992, but his wife, Ro Lady Lala Mara, a chief in her own right as the \"Roko Tui Dreketi\", or Paramount Chief of Burebasaga, one of three hierarchies to which all Fijian chiefs belong in the House of Chiefs, seemed a natural choice to lead a new party as the successor to his. In addition to the Great Council of Chiefs, the powerful Methodist Church also endorsed the party.\n\nMajor General Sitiveni Rabuka, who had led the 1987 coups, joined the new party also, along with his supporters, and he soon outmaneuvered Ro Lala for the leadership and her family subsequently distanced themselves from the party. The SVT won the general election of 1992, but the subsequent defection of six parliamentarians left it without a workable majority. Internal strife weakened the party, and many influential members of the Great Council of Chiefs grew disillusioned with it, as did the Methodist Church. Despite this, it won a plurality in the parliamentary election that was called three years early, in 1994 after the 1993 national budget defeat in parliament.\n\nThe Vanua of Ra Province went against the Great Council of Chiefs GCC supported - SVT party during the 1992 elections and the SVT lost both allocated seats from the Ra constituency during the 1992 Fijian general election. The SVT then traditionally approached the four (4) main traditional chiefs from Ra and endorsed Dr Ratu Wilisoni Tuiketei Malani, the Turaga Gonesau from Nakorotubu to be the sole party's candidate in the Ra Province constituency during the Fiji election of 1994. At the age of 74, Dr Ratu Malani became the oldest member to be elected to the House of Representatives of Fiji during the Fiji election of 1994 from the Ra Province constituency, with Ratu Mesake Nacola, as an independent candidate winning the second seat. \n\nAllegations of corruption eroded the popularity of the SVT-led government, which was heavily defeated in the general election of 1999 by the People's Coalition, taking just 8 of the 71 seats in the House of Representatives. Rabuka quit as leader of the party, and was followed by several short-lived leaders.\n\nFollowing the coup d'état of 2000, Taufa Vakatale resigned as president of the SVT and former Foreign Minister Filipe Bole assumed leadership of the party. It contested the election held to restore democracy in 2001 on a platform of supporting the 1997 constitution with amendments, free public transport for school children, an increase in government spending to alleviate poverty, and promotion of community initiatives to end domestic violence. It also called for a return to first past the post voting. These policies failed to stem the tide, and the SVT's share of the vote sank to just 5.5 percent, and it failed to win any seats. Much of the support it had previously enjoyed went to the new Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua of Laisenia Qarase.\n\nIn June 2002, many members of the party merged with a number of other parties to form the Fiji Democratic Party, under Bole's leadership. This party dissolved itself in April 2005 to join the new National Alliance Party of Fiji, under the leadership of Ratu Epeli Ganilau.\n\nA rump of the SVT resisted the merger, and continues (as of 2005) to exist under the presidency of Rabuka. In May 2005, divisions appeared in the leadership of the party over the government's controversial proposal to establish a Reconciliation and Unity Commission with the power to recommend amnesty to perpetrators of the 2000 coup and compensation to its victims. Rabuka endorsed the proposal, as did executive member Militoni Leweniqila, but Ema Druavesi, General Secretary of the SVT, spoke out against it, calling it a political ploy to retain the support of the Conservative Alliance (CAMV), on whose six parliamentary votes the government depends for its majority. She also expressed concern that the bill interfered with the judicial system. Leweniqila, however, said that not only was the proposal nothing new, it was in fact one that Rabuka, on behalf of the SVT, had proposed as long ago as 2002. He added, however, that acknowledging the government of deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry as the lawful government of the land would be the right place to start.\n\nTowards the end of 2005, the SVT found itself fending off allegations relating to the 2000 coup. In interviews with the Fiji Sun, a daily newspaper, Josaia Waqabaca and Maciu Navakasuasua (who served a three-year prison term for coup-related offences) implicated some senior members of the SVT in the planning of the coup. Druavesi strongly denied that the party had been involved in any way whatsoever, and that if any SVT officials had participated in the plot, they must have done so as individuals, not as representatives of the party. She called on the police to interrogate those identified by Waqabaca and Navakasuasua, however, to determine the truth of the allegations.\n\nOn 26 June 2005, Druavesi made a stinging attack on the ruling Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL), accusing it of racism, corruption, and incompetence. Policies enacted supposedly for the benefit of indigenous Fijians had benefited only a few people with family or business ties to government leaders, she said. \"Top posts and lucrative contracts were awarded to people who support the party,\" she alleged. Druavesi said she believed that the Fijian people, disappointed by the SDL-CAMV coalition, would return to the SVT in the 2006 election.\n\nDruavesi's attacks notwithstanding, Rabuka pursued negotiations with the SDL, and on 25 November Prime Minister Qarase confirmed that his own party would definitely be working with the SVT in the forthcoming election. He expected that one expression of cooperation between the SDL and the SVT, as members of the Grand Coalition, would be to exchange electoral preferences between themselves before going outside the group. Under Fiji's voting system, votes cast for low-polling candidates may be transferred to higher-polling candidates as agreed prior to the election.\n\nDruavesi said on 23 February 2006 that the door was open for former members of the Conservative Alliance, which was dissolved on the 18th, to join the SVT. Not all CAMV members had supported the merger of their party with the SDL, she told the Fiji Village news service. She also revealed that the party had received more than a hundred written applications from persons willing to contest the 2006 election for the SVT.\n\nThe \"Fiji Sun\" reported on 2 March that party officials had met the previous weekend and had decided to continue working as part of the Grand Coalition. The party would not disband or merge with another party, and would retain its identity, Druavesi said. This was because the party was an original one, not a breakaway from another party.\n\nThe party won no seats at the Fiji election of 2006.\n\nLike many other political parties, the SVT was disbanded some time after the military coup of 2006.\n"}
{"id": "1814509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814509", "title": "Transatlantic relations", "text": "Transatlantic relations\n\nTransatlantic relations refer to the historic, cultural, political, economic and social relations between countries on both side of the Atlantic Ocean. Sometimes it specifically means relationships between the Anglophone North American countries (the United States and Canada), and particular European countries or organizations, although other meanings are possible.\n\nThere are a number of issues over which the United States and Europe generally disagree. Some of these are cultural, such as the U.S. use of the death penalty, some are international issues such as the Middle East peace process where the United States is often seen as pro-Israel and where Europe is often seen as pro-Arab, and many others are trade related. The current U.S. policies are often described as being unilateral in nature, whereas the European Union and Canada are often said to take a more multilateral approach, relying more on the United Nations and other international institutions to help solve issues. There are many other issues upon which they agree.\n\nTransatlantic relations can refer to relations between individual states or to relations between groups of states or international organizations with other groups or with states, or within one group.\nFor example:<br>\nWithin a group:\nBetween groups:\nBetween a group and a state:\nBetween states:\n\nBy language and culture\nThe boundaries of which states are part of Transatlantic relations depends on the context. The term may be used as a euphemism to a specific bilateral relationship, for example, Anglo-American relations. The boundary could be drawn so as only to refer member states of the EU plus the US, when discussing Euro-American relations. In other circumstances it may include Canada, or non-EU countries in Europe. The term may also be used in the context of the wider Atlantic world including Africa and Latin America.\n\nThe early relationship between Europe and America was based on colonialism and merchantilism. The majority of modern states in the Americas can be traced back to colonial states that were founded by European nations, states that were very different from the pre-Columbian civilizations and cultures that had existed before.\n\nEven after the United States (and later Canada) became independent, the main relationship between the two continents was one-way migration.\n\nPolitically the United States tried to keep a distance from European affairs, and Canada was subordinate to British foreign policy.\n\nDuring the First World War however both North American states found themselves fighting in Europe and engrossed in European politics. President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points helped to redraw the map of Europe.\n\nAlthough the Roosevelt administration wanted to enter the war against Germany, the vast majority of Americans were too isolationist and disillusioned at their experience in World War I to seek involvement in the World War II, at least until the U.S. was attacked by Japan at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and Adolf Hitler declared war on the United States on December 11, 1941. Once involved, the US became pivotal to the war effort and therefore European politics.\nAfter the second war the United States and Canada both desired a permanent role in the defence of Europe, and European states wanted protection from the Soviet Union. The result was the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which became the lynchpin of Transatlantic relations during the Cold War.\n\nAtlanticism is a philosophy which advocates for close cooperation between North America and Europe.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He usually played as a right back, but could also be deployed in the centre of defence or at right wingback.\n\nBorn in Aylesbury, England, Boyce started his career at the age of sixteen as an apprentice at Luton Town. He rose through the ranks and eventually established himself in the first team, and went on to make 185 league appearances for the club, scoring eight goals.\n\nHe joined Crystal Palace on a free transfer in 2004, where he played in the Premier League for the first time, but he and his teammates were unable to prevent the club from being relegated to the Championship. He spent two years at the club, making 69 league appearances and scoring one goal.\n\nAfter Crystal Palace failed to gain promotion, Boyce returned to Premier League football in 2006, this time with Wigan Athletic after completing a move for a fee of £1 million, and was a key player during his first season when the club narrowly avoided relegation. He remained an active member of the first-team throughout his spell at Wigan, and is the club's Premier League appearance record holder. In May 2013, he captained Wigan Athletic to victory in the 2013 FA Cup Final in a 1–0 win over Manchester City. He last played for Blackpool in the 2015–16 League One season.\n\nBoyce has also represented the Barbados national team, making his debut for the side in 2008.\n\nBoyce was born on 24 September 1979 in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. He grew up in Elmhurst with his parents, Lucille and Melvin, and attended Quarrendon CE Secondary School, where he set athletics records. He began playing football for his local team Aylesbury United F.C. at the age of ten. He played as a striker for two years before being moved to his more familiar position in defence. Boyce was initially unhappy about being moved into his new position, but coach Steve Greenhalf believed Boyce could successfully become a professional footballer as a defender. From the age of twelve, Boyce attended the Luton School of Excellence, and in the summer of 1995 he became an apprentice at Luton Town.\n\nBoyce spent three years playing for Luton's youth team, where he played alongside Gary Doherty and Matthew Upson. The team reached the semi-final of the FA Youth Cup in 1997. He signed professional terms with the club in 1998, and made his debut on 5 January 1999 in a 3–0 home defeat against Walsall in the Auto Windscreens Shield. He appeared once more later in the season, making his league debut in April 1999, in a 1–0 defeat against Lincoln City. At the start of the following season, he was regularly on the substitutes bench, but due to the poor form of first choice right-back Stuart Fraser he was given the opportunity to start the match at home against Chesterfield on Boxing Day. He kept his place in the starting lineup and played 30 times in the league during the season, and scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 defeat against Bournemouth in February 2000. Boyce started the 2000–01 season in the centre of defence. New Luton manager Ricky Hill praised Boyce for his \"tremendous\" displays, and felt he deserved a call-up to the England under-21 squad. He played 42 times in the league, scoring three goals as Luton were relegated to the Third Division.\n\nBoyce was a key figure in the following season for Luton as they gained promotion back into the Second Division, and he was rewarded with a new two-year contract. Despite strong competition for places, he continued playing regularly for Luton in the 2002–03 season, making 34 appearances in the league. During his final season with the club, he made 42 league appearances, scoring four goals, and his performances were recognised when he received the Players' Player, Supporters' Player and Internet Player of the Season awards. In the summer of 2004, he rejected a new contract with Luton and decided to leave the club after his existing contract expired.\n\nFollowing a short trial, Boyce moved to Crystal Palace in July 2004 on a free transfer, signing a two-year deal with the club. He made his debut on 14 August 2004 in Palace's opening Premier League game against Norwich City, and quickly established himself as the club's first-choice right back, and played in almost every league game for the club until a foot injury in March 2005 ruled him out for the rest of the season. The incident occurred during a training session, shortly after Boyce had signed a new deal extending his contract until 2007. Palace were then relegated on the final day of the season after drawing in their match against Charlton Athletic. He returned to the starting line-up in the first game of the new season in the Championship against former club Luton Town. He was a near ever-present throughout the campaign, making 42 league appearances for the club, and scored what would be his only league goal during his time at Palace in a 2–0 win over Coventry City in November 2005. Palace missed out on promotion however, losing in the play-off semi-finals to Watford. Boyce had become a favourite with Palace fans and was voted Player of the Year in 2006.\n\nWith 12 months remaining on his current contract, Boyce rejected a new deal with Palace, stating his desire to return to the Premier League. Rather than letting him leave for free at the end of his contract per the Bosman ruling, Palace accepted an offer for Boyce from Wigan Athletic.\n\nOn 1 August 2006, Boyce was signed by Wigan Athletic on a four-year deal for an initial fee of £1 million. He was initially signed as a replacement on the right side of defence for Pascal Chimbonda, but was often deployed as a centre back. He made his debut for the club on 19 August 2006 in a Premier League match against Newcastle United. He made 34 league appearances during the season, helping the club avoid relegation, which was confirmed on the final day of the season in a 2–1 win against Sheffield United. His performances earned him praise from Wigan supporters, and he narrowly missed out on the club's Player of the Year award.\n\nAt the start of the 2007–08 season, following the signing of Mario Melchiot as the club's new first choice right-back, Boyce found his first team opportunities more limited. However, after a poor start to the season by Wigan, he returned to the starting line-up, which saw an upturn in results, and the club once again avoided relegation. He made 25 league appearances during the season, most of which came during the second half of the season.\n\nOn 15 November 2008, he was sent off for the first time in his career in a 2–2 draw against Newcastle United, after receiving a second yellow card. Replays showed that the decision was harsh, and Wigan manager Steve Bruce called for rule changes to allow clubs to appeal against yellow cards, and also to introduce video technology. Two weeks later, on 29 November 2008, he scored his first goal for Wigan, a header from the edge of the area in a 2–1 win against West Bromwich Albion. He finished the 2008–09 season with 27 appearances.\n\nIn July 2009, he signed a new contract at Wigan, keeping him at the club until 2012. The 2009–10 season was a frustrating one for Boyce. Under new manager Roberto Martínez, he was initially part of the starting line-up, but after being replaced by new signing Gary Caldwell in January, his playing time became more limited. He played 24 times in the league, scoring three goals — the most he had scored in a season since leaving Luton.\n\nBoyce was back in the starting line-up at the beginning of the 2010–11 season, but suffered an injury against Bolton Wanderers in October 2010. He was initially expected to recover in two weeks, but was sidelined for considerably longer after aggravating the injury in training. He returned to the side on 8 January 2011 in the 3–2 FA Cup victory against Hull City. He appeared 22 times in the league, and started in the final game of the season against Stoke City, making a goal line clearance in the first half to keep the score level. Wigan went on to win the game 1–0, securing Premier League survival on the last day of the season for a second time. Boyce was the only Wigan player to play in both the Stoke game and the match against Sheffield United in 2007.\n\nIn August 2011, Boyce signed a new two-year contract at the club. On 25 February 2012, he made his 146th Premier League appearance in a 0–0 draw against Aston Villa, making him the club's record holder for most appearances in the Premier League. On 21 April, he scored his fifth league goal for Wigan in a 2–1 away defeat to Fulham. On 9 May, Boyce was given the outstanding achievement award at Wigan's end of season awards. He followed this up on 13 May, the final match of the season, by scoring two goals against Wolves, including a spectacular volley from outside the penalty box.\n\nIn May 2013 he captained Wigan to win the FA Cup over Manchester City and jointly lifted the cup with non playing club captain Gary Caldwell. In March 2014, he was once again instrumental in captaining Wigan to an upset over Manchester City, this time in the 2014 FA Cup Quarterfinals.\n\nIn August 2015, Boyce ended a 9-year stay at Wigan and joined Blackpool on a free transfer. He was then released by Blackpool following their relegation from League One.\n\nThough born in England, Boyce was also eligible to play for the Barbados national team through his parents Melvin and Lucille, who were both born in Barbados. Boyce earned his first international call-up on 20 March 2008, aged 28, stating that \"The appeal is to play international football. I consider myself a Barbadian and I feel it's the right thing to do to play for my country. I am really looking forward to it.\" He made his debut for Barbados in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Dominica on 26 March 2008, in a 1–0 win which advanced Barbados to the second round of qualifying. His other appearance for Barbados that year came on 22 June in a 1–0 defeat against United States. Boyce was called up again for the 2014 World Cup qualifiers and captained the squad in a 2–0 loss to Guyana in Bridgetown.\nHe was recalled to the team in 2014 and captained the squad during the 2014 Caribbean Cup qualification. He scored his first international goal in the 4–1 win over Bonaire that qualified them for the next round.\n\nScores and Results list Barbados' goal tally first.\nBoyce is a versatile player who usually plays as a right back, but has also been used as a centre back on many occasions. He has also played at left back, on the right wing and as a makeshift striker during his career. In the past he has stated that he does not have a preferred position and is happy to play wherever the manager wants him to play. When playing at right back, although Boyce accepts that his more important role in the team is to defend, he has also demonstrated his ability to get forward to contribute to the team's attack. His consistent performances have earned him praise on several occasions, and he has been described as a \"reliable\" and \"dependable\" player.\n\nFA Cup 2012–13\n\nBoyce has three children, two boys and a girl.\n\nBoyce became the first international ambassador for Street Soccer USA, an organisation which develops sports programs to help the homeless, and he has made appearances at homeless shelters in various cities across the United States. He was first introduced to the organisation after reading about it during a business trip to the United States. On his new role, Boyce commented that \"Soccer is a global sport, it can lift all of our spirits and improve all of our lives and I want to promote the use of the beautiful game in this way. It is a privilege and an honor to be named the first International Ambassador for Street Soccer USA.\"\n\nBoyce’s sister is the solicitor I. Stephanie Boyce, who was inaugurated as Deputy Vice President of the Law Society of England & Wales in July 2019, making history as the first black person to hold the position.\n\n"}

Mitsubishi has formerly used the name in Japan and some international markets, but since the third-generation model, the Pajero Sport/Montero Sport/Shogun Sport was the name used instead.\n\nProduction began in Japan in 1996, and was available for most export markets by 1997, where it was variously known as the Challenger, Pajero Sport in Europe, Montero Sport in North America, South America and the Philippines, Nativa in parts of Latin America, the Caribbean and the Middle East, Shogun Sport in the United Kingdom, and Strada G-Wagon in Thailand. Based on the Strada pickup truck of the same vintage, sharing many components and some body panels (i.e. front doors), the first-generation Challenger was also built on the second-generation Pajero wheelbase, and served as a junior model to the larger Pajero.\n\nLike the Pajero, it featured independent front suspension with torsion bars and a live rear axle. In addition to numerous face lifts over the years, there was a major suspension change from rear leaf to coil springs in late 2000. As its popularity increased, local assembly for foreign markets was introduced in China in 2003, and Brazil in 2006. Sales were discontinued in Japan in 2003, in North America in 2004 (excluding Canada) where it was sold alongside the Endeavor, where it was superseded by the Endeavor, and central and western Europe in 2008. In Japan, it was sold at a specific retail chain called \"Car Plaza\".\n\nThe 3-liter V6 is the most commonly used engine; it produces at 5,000 rpm. The North American market received petrol V6 engines during all years of production while a petrol 2.4 liter engine was offered on base models from 1997 through 1999. Markets outside of North America also had a variety of turbodiesel inline-fours (excluding Canada, where inline-fours were also available) to choose between.\n\nThe second-generation of the vehicle, based on the ladder frame chassis of the Triton, was gradually introduced to selected markets (Russia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East) through the autumn of 2008, following its debut at the Moscow International Automobile Salon. The design is partially influenced from the 4.7-litre V8 powered 2001 Pajero Evolution concept car. 2.5- or 3.2-litre diesel and 3.0- or 3.5-litre V6 petrol engines are available as before, while five- or seven-seat interior configurations are offered. As with the Triton pickup on which it is based, production of the new Pajero Sport for all markets is concentrated in Thailand.\n\nIn the Philippines and Mexico] the Challenger is officially named as Montero Sport. The Montero Sport mainly competes with the Toyota Fortuner and Chevrolet Trailblazer in the Philippines and several other markets.\n\nIn India, the Challenger is sold under the Pajero Sport name. It is equipped with a 4D56-T 2.5-litre 8-valve intercooled with a variable geometry turbocharger SOHC diesel engine giving a maximum output of 175 bhp and 400Nm of torque. It weighs 2065 kg and gives out a mileage of 12kmpl. It sold with a price tag of INR 23.12 lakhs.\n\nIn Bangladesh, the Challenger is assembled by state-owned automotive industry Pragoti and sold under the Pajero Sport name.\n\nIn 2011, Montero Sport owners in the Philippines reported that their vehicles suffered from sudden unintended acceleration. Mitsubishi Motors Philippines later responded with a statement saying that they conducted tests on the Montero Sport's electrical systems and found no problems; furthermore, they stated that the accidents related to the issue were more likely caused by human error. Owners of Montero Sport affected by the sudden unintended acceleration issue plan to file a class action lawsuit against Mitsubishi Motors Philippines. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) opened an investigation panel to probe the accidents and complaints from 2010 to 2015, and will recommend either a product recall or a total sales ban on the Montero Sport in the country.\n\nOn August 1, 2015, Mitsubishi Motors unveiled the third-generation Pajero Sport in Thailand and would be released as the 2016 model and would be powered by the new 4N15 2.4L MIVEC engine. Since the third-generation model was unveiled, it has no longer used the Challenger name, and used Pajero Sport/Montero Sport name instead.\n\nFor the Indonesian market, the third-generation Pajero Sport was launched on January 29, 2016 in Jakarta. It was initially built in and imported from Thailand. Since April 2017, it is built and assembled at the Cikarang plant in Bekasi, West Java.\n\nThe Pajero Sport/Montero Sport has three engine options. The old 4D56 DI-D common rail produce 136 PS and 314 N⋅m (GLX variant in Indonesia) and 4N15 MIVEC with Variable Geometry Turbo producing 181 PS and 430 NM (Dakar variant in Indonesia and all variants in Thailand and the Philippines) and the 3.0L 6B31 MIVEC V6 petrol engine.\n\nIn the Philippines, it is known and marketed as the Montero Sport. As a mass market vehicle, it has added a lot of features compared to its predecessor. The Montero Sport is available in 4 variants: GLX 4x2 (6-speed manual), GLS 4x2 (8-speed automatic), GT 4x2 (8-speed automatic), and GT 4x4 (8-speed automatic). All Variants are powered by a 2.4 MIVEC VGT clean diesel engine.\n\nIn Bangladesh, it is marketed as the Pajero Sport and assembled by Pragoti in Chittagong. It also manufactured the car.\n\nIn the Middle East, it is available with a 6B31 3.0 V6 petrol version.\n\nIn Australia, the Pajero Sport is available in either a five-seater for the base model GLX or GLS and a seven-seater version in the GLS & Exceed. The Pajero Sport only comes in automatic transmission, due to low sales of the manual transmission in the previous generation.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Pajero Sport was released as the Shogun Sport and it is also available as a commercial variant without second and third row seats.\n\nAnother feature of it is the Aisin 8-speed automatic which will improve fuel efficiency while not sacrificing in-gear acceleration and also available with 6-speed manual.

It is a sub-prefecture of the department.\nLe Vigan is located at the south of the Massif Central and near the Mont Aigoual, in the Arre valley. The town is on the southern edge of the Cévennes National Park and is the most populous town within the park.\n\nOn a river at the southern edge of the Massif Central, Le Vigan is situated on a natural boundaryline. In the 2nd-3rd centuries BCE, it was situated between the territories occupied by the Volcae Arecomici, the Averni, and the Gabali tribes. In 121 BCE the Romans gained control of much of southern France including the area around Le Vigan. The Volcae Arecomici voluntarily surrendered their territory, and the Arverni gave up much territory in a treaty that nevertheless preserve their independence. Under Roman control, Le Vigan was part of the Roman \"Provincia,\" (hence Provence) called Gallia Narbonensis. The Visigoths took control of the western half of Gallia Narbonensis in 462 CE, a part known as Septimania which included Le Vigan, and they retained control despite attempts in 586 and 589 by the Frankish (Merovingian) King Guntram to conquer the area from the north. In 587 the region came under Catholic rule with the conversion of the Visigoth king Reccared I. In 719, the Moor Al-Samh conquered Septimania and the Franks struggled to take it back over the next several decades. By 780, Charlemagne had conquered the entire territory.\nLe Vigan is on the site of an ancient Roman town which may be \"Vindomagus\", but it is not certain. There is a spring called \"la source d'Isis,\" which has provided water to the city since at least 1069 and which was named in honor of the Roman goddess. The town was destroyed during the Moorish invasion of Provence.\n\nAs with many towns in the Cévennes, there were many textile industries there in the past. Several quarries south of town above Montdardier were formerly important sources of lithographic limestone. Stone from these quarries earned an honorable mention in the Great Exhibition of 1851.\n\nLe Vigan is a tourist destination during summer time.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Some proposals envision technologically advanced trains reaching speeds of . Most conceptions of the tunnel envision it between the United States and the United Kingdom ‒ or more specifically between New York City and London.\n\nAdvantages compared to air travel could be increased speed, and use of electricity instead of scarce oil based fuel, considering a future time long after peak oil.\n\nThe main barriers to constructing such a tunnel are cost with estimates of between $88 billion to $175 billion as well as the limits of current materials science. Existing major tunnels, such as the Channel Tunnel, Seikan Tunnel and the Gotthard Base Tunnel, despite using less expensive technology than any yet proposed for the transatlantic tunnel, may struggle financially.\n\nMany variations of the concept exist, including a tube above the seabed, a tunnel beneath the ocean floor, or some combination of the two.\n\nA 1960s proposal has a -long near-vacuum tube with vactrains, a theoretical type of maglev train, which could travel at speeds up to . At this speed, the travel-time between New York City and London would be less than one hour. Another modern variation, intended to reduce costs, is a submerged floating tunnel about below the ocean surface, in order to avoid ships, bad weather, and the high pressure associated with a much deeper tunnel near the sea bed. It would consist of 54,000 prefabricated sections held in place by 100,000 tethering cables. Each section would consist of a layer of foam sandwiched between concentric steel tubes, and the tunnel would also have reduced air pressure.\n\nIdeas proposing rocket, jet, scramjet, and air-pressurized tunnels for train transportation have also been put forward. In the proposal described in an \"Extreme Engineering\" episode, trains would take 18 minutes to reach top speed, and 18 minutes at the end to come to a halt. During the deceleration phase, the resultant 0.2g acceleration would lead to an unpleasant feeling of tilting downward, and it was proposed that the seats would individually rotate to face backwards at the midpoint of the journey, in order to make the deceleration more pleasant.\n\nSuggestions for such a structure go back to Michel Verne, son of Jules Verne, who wrote about it in 1888 in a story entitled \"Un Express de l'avenir\" (\"An Express of the Future\"). This story was published in English in \"Strand Magazine\" in 1895, where it was incorrectly attributed to Jules Verne, a mistake frequently repeated today.\n1913 saw the publication of the novel \"Der Tunnel\" by German author Bernhard Kellermann. It inspired four films of the same name: one in 1915 by William Wauer, and separate German, French, and British versions released in 1933 and 1935. The German and French versions were directed by Curtis Bernhardt, and the British one was written in part by science fiction writer Curt Siodmak. Perhaps suggesting contemporary interest in the topic, an original poster for the American release of the British version (renamed \"Transatlantic Tunnel\") was, in 2006, estimated for auction at $2,000–3,000.\n\nRobert H. Goddard, the father of rocketry, was issued two of his 214 patents for the idea.\nArthur C. Clarke mentioned intercontinental tunnels in his 1946 short story \"Rescue Party\" and again in his 1956 novel \"The City and the Stars\". Harry Harrison's 1975 novel \"Tunnel Through the Deeps\" (also published as \"A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah!\") describes a vacuum/maglev system on the ocean floor.\nThe April 2004 issue of \"Popular Science\" suggests that a transatlantic tunnel is more feasible than previously thought, and without major engineering challenges. It compares it favorably with laying transatlantic pipes and cables, but with a cost of 88 to 175 billion dollars. In 2003, the Discovery Channel's show \"Extreme Engineering\" aired a program, titled \"Transatlantic Tunnel\", which discussed the proposed tunnel concept in detail.\n"}

T cells may recognize these complexes using their T cell receptors (TCRs). APCs process antigens and present them to T-cells.\n\nAlmost all cell types can present antigens in some way. They are found in a variety of tissue types. Professional antigen-presenting cells, including macrophages, B cells and dendritic cells, present foreign antigens to helper T cells, while virus-infected cells (or cancer cells) can present antigens originating inside the cell to cytotoxic T cells. In addition to the MHC family of proteins, antigen presentation relies on other specialized signaling molecules on the surfaces of both APCs and T cells.\n\nAntigen-presenting cells are vital for effective adaptive immune response, as the functioning of both cytotoxic and helper T cells is dependent on APCs. Antigen presentation allows for specificity of adaptive immunity and can contribute to immune responses against both intracellular and extracellular pathogens. It is also involved in defense against tumors. Some cancer therapies involve the creation of artificial APCs to prime the adaptive immune system to target malignant cells.\n\nAntigen-presenting cells fall into two categories: professional and non-professional. Those that express MHC class II molecules along with co-stimulatory molecules and pattern recognition receptors are often called professional antigen-presenting cells. The non-professional APCs express MHC class I molecules.\n\nT cells must be activated before they can divide and perform their function. This is achieved by interacting with a professional APC which presents an antigen recognized by their T cell receptor. The APC involved in activating T cells is usually a dendritic cell. T cells cannot recognize and therefore cannot respond to, 'free' or soluble antigens. They can only recognize and respond to antigen that has been processed and presented by cells via carrier molecules like MHC molecules. Helper T cells can recognize exogenous antigen presented on MHC class II; cytotoxic T cells can recognize endogenous antigen presented on MHC class I. Most cells in the body can present antigen to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells via MHC class I; however, the term \"antigen-presenting cell\" is often used specifically to describe professional APCs. Such cells express MHC class I and MHC class II molecules and can stimulate CD4+ helper T cells as well as cytotoxic T cells.\n\nAPCs can also present foreign and self lipids to T cells and NK cells by using the CD1 family of proteins, which are structurally similar to the MHC class I family.\n\nProfessional APCs specialize in presenting antigen to T cells. They are very efficient at internalizing antigens, either by phagocytosis e.g. macrophages or by receptor-mediated endocytosis (B cells), processing the antigen into peptide fragments and then displaying those peptides, bound to a class II MHC molecule, on their membrane. The T cell recognizes and interacts with the antigen-class II MHC molecule complex on the membrane of the antigen-presenting cell. An additional co-stimulatory signal is then produced by the antigen-presenting cell, leading to activation of the T cell. The expression of co-stimulatory molecules and MHC class II are defining features of professional APCs. All professional APCs also express MHC class I molecules as well.\n\nThe main types of professional antigen-presenting cells are dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells.\n\nDendritic cells have the broadest range of antigen presentation and are necessary for activation of naive T cells. DCs present antigen to both helper and cytotoxic T cells. They can also perform cross-presentation, a process by which they present exogenous antigen on MHC class I molecules to cytotoxic T cells. Cross-presentation allows for the activation of these T cells. Dendritic cells also play a role in peripheral tolerance, which contributes to prevention of auto-immune disease.\n\nPrior to encountering foreign antigen, dendritic cells express very low levels of MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules on their cell surface. These immature dendritic cells are ineffective at presenting antigen to T helper cells. Once a dendritic cell's pattern-recognition receptors recognize a pathogen-associated molecular pattern, antigen is phagocytosed and the dendritic cell becomes activated, upregulating the expression of MHC class II molecules. It also upregulates several co-stimulatory molecules required for T cell activation, including CD40 and B7. The latter can interact with CD28 on the surface of a CD4+ T cell. The dendritic cell is then a fully mature professional APC. It moves from the tissue to lymph nodes, where it encounters and activates T cells.\n\nMacrophages can be stimulated by T cell secretion of interferon gamma. After this activation, macrophages are able to express MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules, including the B7 complex and can present phagocytosed peptide fragments to helper T cells. Activation can assist pathogen-infected macrophages in clearing the infection. Deriving from a monocyte, type of white blood cell, they will circulate the blood and enter affected sites and differentiate from monocytes to macrophages. At the affected site, the macrophage surrounds the site of infection or tissue damage with its membrane in a mechanism called phagocytosis.\n\nB cells can internalize antigen that binds to their B cell receptor and present it to helper T cells. Unlike T cells, B cells can recognize soluble antigen for which their B cell receptor is specific. They can then process the antigen and present peptides using MHC class II molecules. When a T helper cell with a TCR specific for that peptide binds, the B cell marker CD40 binds to CD40L on the T cell surface. When activated by a T cell, a B cell can undergo antibody isotype switching, affinity maturation, as well as formation of memory cells.\n\nNon-professional antigen presenting cells include all nucleated cell types in the body. They use an MHC class I molecule coupled to beta-2 microglobulin to display endogenous peptides on the cell membrane. These peptides originate within the cell itself, in contrast to the exogenous antigen displayed by professional APCs using MHC class II molecules. Cytotoxic T cells are able to interact with endogenous antigen presented using an MHC class I molecule. Non-professional APCs do not typically express MHC class II molecules. However, it has been observed that antigen presentation to CD4+ cells via MHC class II is not restricted to the classically professional APCs. Other leukocytes, including granulocytes such as mast cells and neutrophils, can be induced to do so, as can endothelial and epithelial cells under certain circumstances. Even so, there is little evidence that these atypical APCs are able to activate naive CD4+ T cells.\n\nAfter dendritic cells have phagocytosed pathogens, they usually migrate to the vast network of lymph vessels and are carried by lymph flow to the draining lymph nodes. Each lymph node is a collection point where APCs can interact with T cells. During the migration, DCs undergo a process of maturation: they lose most of their ability to further engulf pathogens and they mature by changing surface expression of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules, as well as increased production of cytokines. The internalized antigen is digested into smaller peptides containing epitopes, which are then presented to T cells by the MHC.\n\nB cells reside in the lymph node. Once their B cell receptor binds to an antigen, they can interact with activated helper T cells, as described above.\n\nA dendritic cell that interacts with an already-activated helper T cell can become licensed. This occurs through the interaction of co-stimulatory molecules including B7 and CD40 on the dendritic cell, with CD28 and CD40 ligand on the T cell. Only licensed dendritic cells are able to activate cytotoxic T cells. T cell licensing of dendritic cells is key for activation of cytotoxic T cells for many pathogens, although the extent to which T cell help is needed may vary.\n\nIn MHC class I and class II molecules, only certain epitopes of an internalized peptide can be presented. These epitopes are termed immunodominant.\n\nAPCs naturally have a role in fighting tumors, via stimulation of B and cytotoxic T cells to respectively produce antibodies against tumor-related antigen and kill malignant cells. Dendritic cells, presenting tumor-specific antigen to T cells, are key to this process. Cancer therapies have included treating the patient with increased numbers of dendritic cells or cancer-specific T cells. However, newer therapies have turned to genetically engineered artificial antigen-presenting cells designed to prime the immune system to attack malignant cells. Some artificial APCs are derived from human cells; others are acellular, containing MHC proteins, co-stimulatory molecules and the necessary peptides.\n\nThe APC activator IMP321 is being tested in clinical trials to accelerate the immune reaction to eliminate metastatic breast cancer or melanoma.\n\n\n"}

He was most recently a first-team coach at League One club Milton Keynes Dons.\n\nButterfield was born in Boston, Lincolnshire and began his career as a youth with Grimsby Town. He made 232 appearances for Crystal Palace before moving on to Charlton Athletic, Southampton, Bolton Wanderers, Carlisle United and Exeter City.\n\nButterfield was educated at Boston Grammar School in Boston, Lincolnshire. He was snapped up by Grimsby Town as a youngster, and was promoted to the club's first team setup midway through the 1996–1997 season. Butterfield was primarily used as a right back while at Blundell Park and made his first team debut in a 0–0 draw with York City on 9 September 1997. Butterfield went on to make eleven appearances in the 1997–1998 season, and scored his first senior goal in the club's 1–0 Football League Trophy victory over Hull City that season. Despite playing no part in either, Butterfield was among the winning squad who earned a double Wembley win that same season, triumphing in the Football League Trophy, as well as the Second Division Play-Off Final\n\nAs the seasons progressed, Butterfield became more and more involved in club affairs, and featured often on the right side of defence and as a makeshift centre half. He was part of the Grimsby team that defeated Liverpool in the League Cup in 2001–02. (at 0–0 Butterfield kept Grimsby on level terms by clearing an Emile Heskey header off the line).\n\nAt the end of the 2001–02 season, Butterfield decided against a new contract and moved to Crystal Palace In his five years at Grimsby Town from 1997 to 2002, Butterfield featured 124 times in the League, scoring 3 times. He played under three different managers, Alan Buckley, Lennie Lawrence and Paul Groves.\n\nHe arrived at Selhurst Park in 2002 where he quickly became a favourite of the crowd. He played regularly for the next two seasons, playing in the 2004 Football League First Division play-off Final that resulted in Palace's promotion to the Premier League.\n\nThe form of Emmerson Boyce and long-term injuries restricted his appearances for the next two seasons, before re-establishing himself in the right-back spot for a spell. Midway through the 2008–09 season he was loaned out to Charlton Athletic, but he managed to regain his place in the Palace line-up the following season, despite his Eagles career appearing to be over.\n\nButterfield started the 2009-10 Football League Championship season as the main right back ahead of Nathaniel Clyne. However, due to Palace's financial problems, that saw them put into administration, he was converted to a makeshift striker. Butterfield scored a hat-trick in the space of 6 minutes and 48 seconds during a 2009–10 FA Cup fourth round replay 3–1 win against Wolves; he scored with his left foot, right foot and his head which is described as the 'perfect hat-trick'. This is the club's fastest ever hat-trick, beating the previous record set by Dougie Freedman in 11 minutes, somewhat ironically against Butterfield's old club Grimsby Town, in a match that Palace went on to win 5–0. Palace manager Neil Warnock revealed after the game that Clyne, who had played at right-back during the game, had turned down a move to Wolves only days earlier. Had the move gone through, Butterfield would have played at right-back instead.\n\nOn 16 July 2010, he joined Southampton on a one-year deal and joined the squad in Interlaken ready for the game against FC Sochaux. On 7 August 2010, Butterfield made his debut for Southampton in a 1–0 loss against Plymouth. Since making his debut, Butterfield established himself in the starting eleven in the right back position. His good form kept Frazer Richardson out of the starting line-up and Southampton were promoted to the Championship for the 2011–12 season after their 3–1 win over Plymouth.\n\nIn his first season, Butterfield made 38 appearance (34 League, 2 League Cup and 2 FA Cup) for Southampton supplying three assists. After the end of 2010–11 season, Butterfield signed another 12 months deal. Butterfield told Saints' official website \"\"My contract has now flowed into next season because of the amount of games I played and I'm certainly happy to be on board at a club that is going in the right direction, I think I've played a reasonable amount of games and I think I've played reasonably well all season. For us to get promoted is a massive thing for the club and for me to be a part of it, I'm really happy with that.\"\"\n\nIn his second season, Butterfield began to be used more sparingly after injury prevented him from training and he struggled to force his way back into the Southampton starting eleven. On 9 August 2011, Butterfield played 120 minutes in a match against Torquay United in a League Cup tie which Southampton won 4–1. His first league match of the 2011–12 season came on 29 October 2011 when he played 90 minutes against Middlesbrough and made an assist for Guly to score the first goal in the game after Butterfield made a cross to allow Guly to score a header. The match ended 3–0 for Southampton. Despite his fitness and injury preventing him from playing, on 17 February 2012, Butterfield signed a one-year contract extension with the club, keeping him at Southampton until June 2013.\n\nFollowing the signing of Nathaniel Clyne, Butterfield made no appearances for Southampton in the Premier League in 2012–13. On 28 March 2013, he moved on loan to Bolton Wanderers, managed by his former Crystal Palace teammate Dougie Freedman and assisted by Lennie Lawrence, his old manager at Grimsby. He made his debut two days later, coming on as a second-half substitute for Marvin Sordell in the away game at former club Charlton Athletic. He made his first start for Bolton at the Reebok Stadium in the 1–0 win against Huddersfield Town.\n\nButterfield was released by Southampton on 4 June 2013 at the end of the 2012–13 season.\n\nOn 23 August 2013 Butterfield signed on non-contract terms with League One side Carlisle United following an unsuccessful trial with then newly promoted Championship side Bournemouth.\n\nButterfield made his debut on the same day in a 1–1 draw at Colchester United.\n\nOn 2 September 2013 Butterfield was released by mutual consent after having only made 2 appearances for Carlisle.\n\nOn 21 September 2013 Butterfield signed for League Two side Exeter City.\n\nOn 14 May 2015 Exeter manager Paul Tisdale appointed Butterfield as a player-coach. Butterfield departed the club and subsequently retired from playing football in September 2016, just over a month into the 2016–17 season.\n\nOn 16 September 2016, Butterfield was appointed assistant manager of Southampton's Under-18 team. He left his academy coaching position with Southampton on 10 August 2018 and immediately joined League Two club Milton Keynes Dons as a first-team coach.\n\nAfter achieving promotion with MK Dons from League Two at the conclusion of the 2018–19 season, Butterfield's contract with the club was terminated along with manager Paul Tisdale and assistant manager Matt Oakley on 2 November 2019 following a poor run of results.\n\nGrimsby Town\n\nSouthampton\n\nIndividual\n\n"}

Fairfax, the Parliamentary commander, had 3,000-4,000 men in Bradford. Despite inferior numbers, Fairfax came to intercept the Royalist army, as Bradford was ill-prepared to resist a siege. \n\nThe Parliamentarians were due to leave Bradford at 4:00 am, but left much later on account of the \"laxity or worse of General Gifford\". When they arrived at Adwalton Moor, the Royalist commander had deployed his army effectively and despite early success by the Parliamentarians, the Royalists decisively defeated them.\n\nThe battle consolidated Royalist control of Yorkshire, and has been deemed of low or medium term significance. However, historians have acknowledged that the impact of the battle, which left the Parliamentarians with only one stronghold in the north (Hull) and forced the Parliamentarians into a religious and political alliance with Scotland. This in turn, led to a Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Marston Moor a year later in 1644. Historic England labelled the battle as second only in importance to Marston Moor.\n\nThe site of the battle is high ground in Adwalton (now commonly considered to be part of Drighlington) near Bradford, which is now in an area of rural-urban fringe, (map reference SE2228). Parts of the site are protected as \"green belt\" or other types of open space with the A650 road cutting right through the battlefield. It is the only battlefield recognised by Bradford Metropolitan District Council as falling within its boundaries but it actually lies within the Leeds City Council boundary. There are plaques interpreting the battlefield for visitors.\n\nPrior to the battle, the Royalists captured Parliamentary-held Howley Hall ( southeast of Adwalton) to secure their advance on Bradford. This was their starting point for their march on Bradford on 30 June 1643.\n\nThere is a display relating to the battle at Bolling Hall, Bradford, a museum which lies a few miles from the site and was itself a Royalist base. Oakwell Hall is another museum which throws light on the civil war in Yorkshire: although the hall is situated within walking distance from the battlefield, it falls outside the boundaries of Bradford and within those of Kirklees.\n"}

While the 2005 Conservative majority was marginal, the 2010 majority was 24.1% of the vote, so on the percentage of majority measure, but not on the longevity measure, it bore a safe seat hallmark.\n\nIn elections to the London Borough of Merton, the seat returns most of the council's Conservative councillors. The hillside and hilltop wards have since 1921 been unpromising territory for any party other than the Conservatives. However, since 1990, the ward of Merton Park has only ever returned councillors for Merton Park Ward Residents Association. Since 1994, the ward of West Barnes, which contains Merton's half of the town of Motspur Park, has swung between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats; the latter presently hold all three seats in the ward. In the local elections in 2018, Liberal Democrat councillors were elected in the wards of Trinity and Dundonald for the first time in the borough's history. Wards as currently drawn (see fair apportionment for equal numbers of voters) Abbey and Cannon Hill routinely return Labour councillors.\n\nIn 2010, the second-placed candidate was a Liberal Democrat. At 25%, this was the highest vote for the Liberal Party/Liberal Democrats in the constituency since 1987. The national collapse in the Liberal Democrat vote at the 2015 election meant that Labour returned to second place in 2015, an order which was repeated in 2017, with a swing of 7.6%.\n\nIn the 2016 referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union, the London Borough of Merton, of which the constituency is a part, voted to remain by 62.9%.\n\n\n1885–1918: The Sessional Division of Croydon except so much as is within a district of the Metropolis, the parishes of Caterham, Chelsham, Farley, Warlingham, Merton, and Wimbledon, so much of the Parliamentary Borough of Deptford as is in Surrey, and the area of the Parliamentary Boroughs of Battersea and Clapham, Camberwell, Lambeth, Newington, Southwark, and Wandsworth.\n\n1918–1950: The Municipal Borough of Wimbledon, and the Urban District of Merton and Morden.\n\n1950–1955: The Municipal Boroughs of Wimbledon, and Malden and Coombe.\n\n1955–1974: The Municipal Borough of Wimbledon.\n\n1974–1983: The London Borough of Merton wards of Cannon Hill, Priory, West Barnes, Wimbledon East, Wimbledon North, Wimbledon South, and Wimbledon West.\n\n1983–2010: The London Borough of Merton wards of Abbey, Cannon Hill, Dundonald, Durnsford, Hillside, Merton Park, Raynes Park, Trinity, Village, and West Barnes.\n\n2010–present: As above less Durnsford ward and with Wimbledon Park ward added.\n\nThe seat has a commuter-sustained suburban economy with an imposing shopping centre, overwhelmingly privately-built and owned or rented homes and a range of open green spaces, ranging in value from elevated Wimbledon Village - sandwiched between Wimbledon Common and Wimbledon Park - where a large tranche of homes exceed £1,000,000 - to Merton Abbey ruins and South Wimbledon, with more social housing in its wards.\n\nWimbledon station is a southern terminus of the District line, as well as a station on the South West main line. It is also the western terminus of the Croydon Tramlink. South Wimbledon is a station on the Northern line branch to Morden.\n\nWorkless claimants who were registered jobseekers were in November 2012 significantly lower than the national average of 3.8%, at 1.5% of the population based on a statistical compilation by \"The Guardian\".\n\nWards in this area often see a minority of Liberal Democrat and Labour councillors. Voters have quite high median and mean incomes, with an above-average public sector workforce which together means the seat resembles similar Tory-strong seats for London with other party traditions also followed: Richmond Park, Kingston and Surbiton and Putney. As widely touted in opinion polls the runner-up of the 2019 election became the Liberal Democrat.\n\n\"Substantial loss of territory to create Mitcham and Morden\"\n\n\n\n"}

Four additional monarchs were given an Icling pedigree in later genealogical sources but are now believed to have descended from the family by way of Penda's sister.\n\nIcel himself is of debatable historicity; according to Nicholas Brooks, if historical he would have lived sometime between 450 and 525 and was probably considered the founder of the dynasty because he was the first of his line in Britain. Despite the Icelingas' claims of ties with the rulers and mythic heroes of continental Angeln and with the war-god Woden, Brooks suggests that the Icelingas were, before Penda's rise in prominence, no more and no less royal than any of the other ruling houses of the small Midlands peoples as recorded in the \"Tribal Hidage\" and assessed as having between 300 and 600 hides of land.\nIcel's ancestry in genealogical tradition is as follows: Icel son of Eomer son of Angeltheow son of Offa son of Wermund son of Wihtlæg son, grandson or great-grandson of Woden.\nIn this tradition, Icel is the leader of the Angles who migrated to Britain. Icel is then separated from the establishment of Mercia by three generations: Icel's son was \"Cnebba\", whose son was \"Cynewald\", whose son was Creoda, first king of Mercia.\n\nMatthew Paris s.a. 527 reports, \"pagans came from Germania and occupied East Anglia... some of whom invaded Mercia and fought many battles with the British[.]\" This date, however, should perhaps be amended to 515.\nThe \"Vita Sancti Guthlaci\" (\"Life of Saint Guthlac\") reports Guthlac of Crowland to have been son of Penwalh, a Mercian who could trace his pedigree back to Icel.\n\nSeveral place names in England have been suggested as derived from the name of Icel or the Iclingas, including Icklingham, Ickleford, Ickleton and Ixworth. Norman Scarfe noted that the Icknield Way had early spellings \"Icenhylte weg\" and \"Icenhilde weg\" and suggested a connection between Icklingham and the Iceni, although Warner (1988) has cast doubt on the identification. The name \"Iclinga\" survives as \"Hickling\" and several similar spellings.\n\nThe following are Iclinga kings of Mercia whose historicity is certain.\nCreoda of Mercia is of uncertain historicity (if historical, he would date to the end of the 6th century). Cearl of Mercia who ruled during the early 7th century was probably not an Icling.\n\n"}

{"id": "1814598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814598", "title": "Ernst Rüdin", "text": "Ernst Rüdin\n\nErnst Rüdin (April 19, 1874 in St. Gallen – October 22, 1952) was a Swiss-born German psychiatrist, geneticist, eugenicist and Nazi. Rising to prominence under Emil Kraepelin and assuming his directorship at what is now called the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich. While he has been credited as a pioneer of psychiatric inheritance studies, he also argued for, designed, justified and funded the mass sterilization and clinical killing of adults and children.\n\nCommencing in 1893 Rüdin studied medicine at universities in several countries, graduating in 1898. At the Burghölzli in Zurich, he worked as assistant to Eugen Bleuler who coined the term 'schizophrenia'. He completed his PhD, then a psychiatric residency at a Berlin prison. From 1907 he worked at the University of Munich as assistant to Emil Kraepelin, the highly influential psychiatrist who had developed the diagnostic split between 'dementia praecox' ('early dementia' – reflecting his pessimistic prognosis – renamed schizophrenia) and 'manic-depressive illness' (including unipolar depression), and who is considered by many to be the father of modern psychiatric classification. Rüdin became senior lecturer in 1909 as well as senior physician at the Munich Psychiatric Hospital, succeeding Alois Alzheimer.\n\nKraepelin and Rüdin were both ardent advocates of a theory that the German race was becoming overly 'domesticated' and thus degenerating into higher rates of mental illness and other conditions. Fears of degeneration were somewhat common internationally at the time, but the extent to which Rüdin took them may have been unique, and from the very beginning of his career he made continuous efforts to have his research translate into political action. He also repeatedly drew attention to the financial burden of the sick and disabled.\n\nRüdin developed the concept of \"empirical genetic prognosis\" of mental disorders. He published influential initial results on the genetics of schizophrenia (known as dementia praecox) in 1916. Rüdin's data did not show a high enough risk in siblings for schizophrenia to be due to a simple recessive gene as he and Kraepelin thought, but he put forward a two-recessive-gene theory to try to account for this. This has been attributed to a \"mistaken belief\" that just one or a small number of gene variations caused such conditions. Similarly his own large study on Mood disorders correctly disproved his own theory of simple Mendelian inheritance and also showed environmental causes, but Rüdin simply neglected to publish and continued to advance his eugenic theories. Nevertheless, Rüdin pioneered and refined complex techniques for conducting studies of inheritance, was widely cited in the international literature for decades, and is still regarded as \"the father of psychiatric genetics\".\n\nRüdin was influenced by his then brother-in-law, and long-time friend and colleague, Alfred Ploetz, who was considered the 'father' of racial hygiene and indeed had coined the term in 1895. This was a form of eugenics, inspired by social darwinism, which had gained some popularity internationally, as would the voluntary or compulsory sterilization of psychiatric patients, initially in America. Rüdin campaigned for this early on. At a conference on alcoholism in 1903, he argued for the sterilisation of 'incurable alcoholics', but his proposal was roundly defeated. In 1904 he was appointed co-editor in chief of the newly founded Archive for Racial Hygiene and Social Biology, and in 1905 was among the co-founders of the German Society for Racial Hygiene (which soon became International), along with Ploetz. He published an article of his own in Archives in 1910, in which he argued that medical care for the mentally ill, alcoholics, epileptics and others was a distortion of natural laws of natural selection, and medicine should help to clean the genetic pool.\n\nIn 1917 a new German Institute for Psychiatric Research was established in Munich (known as the DFA in German; renamed the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry after World War II), designed and driven forward by Emil Kraepelin. The Institute incorporated a Department of Genealogical and Demographic Studies (known as the GDA in German) – the first in the world specialising in psychiatric genetics – and Rüdin was put in charge by overall director Kraepelin. In 1924 the Institute came under the umbrella of the prestigious Kaiser Wilhelm Society. From 1925 Rüdin spent three years as full Professor of Psychology at Basel, Switzerland. He returned to the Institute in 1928, with an expanded departmental budget and new building at 2 Kraepelinstrasse, financed primarily by the American Rockefeller Foundation. The institute soon gained an international reputation as leading psychiatric research, including in hereditary genetics. In 1931, a few years after Kraepelin's death, Rüdin took over the directorship of the entire Institute as well as remaining head of his department.\n\nRüdin was among the first to attempt to educate the public about the \"dangers\" of hereditary defectives and the value of the Nordic race as \"culture creators\". By 1920 his colleague Alfred Hoche published, with lawyer Karl Binding, the influential \"Allowing the Destruction of Life Unworthy of Living\".\n\nIn 1930 Rüdin was a leading German representative at the First International Congress for Mental Hygiene, held in Washington, US, arguing for eugenics. In 1932 he became President of the International Federation of Eugenics Organizations. He was in contact with Carlos Blacker of the British Eugenics Society, and sent him a copy of pre-Nazi voluntary sterilization laws enacted in Prussia; a precursor to the Nazi forced sterilization laws that Rüdin is said to have already prepared in his desk drawer.\n\nFrom 1935 to 1945 he was President of the Society of German Neurologists and Psychiatrists (GDNP), later renamed the German Association for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Neurology (DGPPN).\n\nThe American Rockefeller Foundation funded numerous international researchers to visit and work at Rüdin's psychiatric genetics department, even as late as 1939. These included Eliot Slater and Erik Stromgren, considered the founding fathers of psychiatric genetics in Britain and Scandinavia respectively, as well as Franz Josef Kallmann who became a leading figure in twins research in the US after emigrating in 1936. Kallmann had claimed in 1935 that 'minor anomalies' in otherwise unaffected relatives of schizophrenics should be grounds for compulsory sterilization.\n\nRüdin's research was also supported with manpower and financing from the German National Socialists.\n\nIn 1933, Ernst Rüdin, Alfred Ploetz, and several other experts on racial hygiene were brought together to form the Expert Committee on Questions of Population and Racial Policy under Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick. The committee's ideas were used as a scientific basis to justify the racial policy of Nazi Germany and its \"Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring\" was passed by the German government on January 1, 1934. Rüdin was such an avid proponent that colleagues nicknamed him the \"Reichsfuhrer for Sterilization\"\n\nIn a speech to the German Society for \"Rassenhygiene\" published in 1934, Rüdin recalled the early days of trying to alert the public to the special value of the Nordic race and the dangers of defectives. He stated: \"The significance of \"Rassenhygiene\" racial hygiene did not become evident to all aware Germans until the political activity of Adolf Hitler and only through his work has our 30-year-long dream of translating \"Rassenhygiene\" into action finally become a reality.\" Describing it as a 'duty of honour' for society to help implement the Nazi policies, Rüdin declared: \"Whoever is not physically or mentally fit must not pass on his defects to his children. The state must take care that only the fit produce children. Conversely, it must be regarded as reprehensible to withhold healthy children from the state.\"\n\nFrom early on Rüdin had been a 'racial fanatic' for the purity of the 'German people'. However he was also described in 1988 as \"not so much a fanatical Nazi as a fanatical geneticist\". His ideas for reducing new cases of schizophrenia would prove a total failure, despite between 73% and 100% of the diagnosed being sterilised or killed.\n\nRüdin joined the Nazi party in 1937. In 1939, on his 65th birthday, he was awarded a 'Goethe medal for art and science' handed to him personally by Hitler, who honoured him as the 'pioneer of the racial-hygienic measures of the Third Reich'. In 1944 he received a bronze Nazi eagle medal (Adlerschild des Deutschen Reiches), with Hitler calling him the 'pathfinder in the field of hereditary hygiene'.\n\nIn 1942, speaking about 'euthanasia', Rüdin emphasised \"the value of eliminating young children of clearly inferior quality\". He supported and financially aided the work of Julius Duessen at Heidelberg University with Carl Schneider, clinical research which from the beginning involving killing children.\n\nAt the end of the war in 1945, Rüdin claimed he had only ever engaged in academic science, only ever heard rumours of killings at the nearby insane asylums, and that he hated the Nazis. However, some of his Nazi political activities, scientific justifications, and awards from Hitler were already uncovered in 1945 (as were his lecture handouts praising Nordics and disparaging Jews). Investigative journalist Victor H. Bernstein concluded: \"I am sure that Prof. Rüdin never so much as killed a fly in his 74 years. I am also sure he is one of the most evil men in Germany.\" Rüdin was stripped of his Swiss citizenship which he had held jointly with German, and two months later was placed under house arrest by the Munich Military Government. However, interned in the US, he was released in 1947 after a 'denazification' trial where he was supported by former colleague Kallmann (a eugenicist himself) and famous quantum physicist Max Planck; his only punishment was a 500-mark fine.\nSpeculation about the reasons for his early release, despite having been considered as a potential criminal defendant for the Nuremberg trials, include the need to restore confidence and order in the German medical profession; his personal and financial connections to prestigious American and British researchers, funding bodies and others; and the fact that he repeatedly cited American eugenic sterilization initiatives to justify his own as legal (indeed the Nuremberg trials carefully avoided highlighting such links in general). Nevertheless, Rüdin has been cited as a more senior and influential architect of Nazi crimes than the physician who was sentenced to death, Karl Brandt, or the infamous Josef Mengele who had attended his lectures and been employed by his Institute.\n\nAfter Rüdin's death in 1952 the funeral eulogy was held by Kurt Pohlisch, a close friend who had been professor of psychiatry at Bonn University, director of the second-largest genetics research institute in Germany, and expert Nazi advisor on Action T4.\n\nRüdin's connections to the Nazis were a major reason for criticisms of psychiatric genetics in Germany after 1945.\n\nHe was survived by his daughter, Edith Zerbin-Rüdin, who became a psychiatric geneticist and eugenicist herself. In 1996 Zerbin-Rüdin, along with Kenneth S. Kendler, published a series of articles on his work which were criticised by others for whitewashing his racist and later Nazi ideologies and activities (Elliot S. Gershon also notes that Zerbin-Rüdin acted as defender and apologist for her father in private conversation and in a transcribed interview published in 1988). Kendler and other leading psychiatric genetic authors have been accused as recently as 2013 of producing revisionist historical accounts of Rüdin and his 'Munich School'. Three types of account have been identified: \"(A) those who write about German psychiatric genetics in the Nazi period, but either fail to mention Rüdin at all, or cast him in a favorable light; (B) those who acknowledge that Rüdin helped promote eugenic sterilization and/or may have worked with the Nazis, but generally paint a positive picture of Rüdin's research and fail to mention his participation in the \"euthanasia\" killing program; and (C) those who have written that Rüdin committed and supported unspeakable atrocities.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Specifically, the law makes it illegal to publicly \"deny, play down, justify or approve of the genocide committed by the German National Socialist regime during the Second World War\". Prosecution is led by the Belgian Centre for Equal Opportunities. The offense is punishable by imprisonment of up to one year and fines of up to 2,500 EUR.\n\nThe Holocaust denial bill, drafted by Claude Eerdekens and Yvan Mayeur of the Parti Socialiste, was introduced in the Chamber of Representatives by Eerdekens (PS), Marcel Cheron (Ecolo), Marcel Colla (SP), Yvan Mayeur (PS), Luc Dhoore (CVP), Raymond Langendries (CDH), Louis Michel (MR) and Mieke Vogels (Agalev) on June 30, 1992.\n\nThe bill passed the Chamber of Representatives on February 2, 1995, with 194 votes in favour, 0 against and 0 abstentions.\n\nThe bill passed the Senate on March 14, 1995.\n\nThe Vlaams Blok, the predecessor of the Vlaams Belang, voted for the law, \"out of a desire for respectability and to break out of its political isolation\", even though its leadership \"contained Holocaust deniers\".\n\nSenator Herman Suykerbuyk (CVP), author of a 1996 Flemish decree placing on the same level victims of the Nazi occupation and \"victims\" of the post World War II repression, abstained when the bill was voted in the Senate.\n\nKing Albert II signed and promulgated the bill on March 23, 1995. The Act was published in the Belgian Official Journal on March 30, 1995 and entered into force on the same day.\n\nIn the past, adversaries of the law have argued that this law restricts the freedom of expression, which is a basic human right. In a decision of 24 June 2003, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) stated that \"\"denying or minimising the Holocaust must be seen as one of the acutest forms of racial slandering and incentives to hatred towards the Jews. The negation or the revision of historical facts of this type call into question the values which found the fight against racism and anti-semitism and is likely to seriously disturb law and order. Attacks against the rights of others of this kind are incompatible with democracy and human rights and their authors incontestably have aims that are prohibited by article 17 of the Convention.\"\" The court concludes that in application of article 17 of the ECHR, the plaintiff can't appeal to the protection of article 10 ECHR, insofar that he wants to use the freedom of expression to dispute crimes against humanity.\n\nOn 14 April 2005, the Antwerp Court of Appeal convicted Siegfried Verbeke to 1 year imprisonment and a fine of 2,500 EUR, based on this law. The court also suspended his civic rights for a period of 10 years. The Centre for Equal Opportunities and the Belgian Auschwitz Foundation each received symbolic damages of 1 EUR.\n\nIn June 2005, a reform of the law was debated in the Belgian Senate in order to extend its scope to the negation of other genocides, e.g. the Armenian Genocide and the Rwandan genocide. Due to political and public controversy about the legal qualification of the Armenian genocide, the reform was postponed.\nNegation of the Armenian genocide has been systematically used as an electoral campaigning tool by Turkish candidates (from all parties) and organisations during Belgian elections since 1999, making it electorally difficult for some parties to take a clear stance on making it illegal.\n\n"}

A memoir about growing up in Southern Rhodesia in the 1960s and 1970s during the Rhodesian Bush War, it was described by the \"Boston Globe\" as \"devastatingly brilliant\" and \"[o]ne of the best memoirs to come out of Africa.\" The book won The Orwell Prize in 1997. \n\nIn 2006, his second memoir, \"When a Crocodile Eats the Sun\", was published. It details the ebbing of his father's life, set to the backdrop of modern-day Zimbabwe, and his discovery of his father's Polish Jewish roots.\n\nGodwin's book, \"The Fear: Robert Mugabe and the Martyrdom of Zimbabwe\" (2011), chronicles the systematic campaign of murder and torture unleashed by Zimbabwe's autocratic ruler following his defeat at the polls. Godwin was interviewed by Terry Gross on \"Fresh Air\" (NPR) in March 2011 about the situation in Zimbabwe since the 2008 general election.\n\n\"The Fear\" was selected as a best book of 2011 by The New Yorker, The Economist, and Publishers Weekly.\n\nGodwin and Coles live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan with their sons, Thomas and Hugo, who as of November 2019 were aged 20 and 18 respectively, and with a dog called Phoebe.

It is mentioned in sources, such as \"Bósa saga ok Herrauds\" and \"Hervarar saga\".\n\nIn Glæsisvellir could be found a location called Ódáinsakr, or Údáinsakr (lit. \"Deathless Acre\", meaning the \"Undying Lands\"). Everyone who went there became healthy and young, and so no one ever died there. The \"Eireks saga víðförla\" is about a man who searched for and found Údáinsakr.\n\nIn the Hervarar saga, it is the kingdom of Gudmund and his son Höfund. Gudmund was a friendly giant who was popular in later sagas.\n\nIn \"Gesta Danorum\", Saxo Grammaticus makes a reference to Odainsaker as the place where the Scanian governor Fialler retired after having been attacked by the Danish king Wiglek:\n\nThe Glæsisvellir and the Ódáinsakr have close counterparts in earlier motifs of Irish storytelling. Given the extremely close correspondence between the motif complex of the Glæsisvellir and the Ódáinsakr and Irish motifs, and given that the Irish sources pre-date the Norse sources (starting already in the late seventh century), it can be assumed that the Glæsisvellir and the Ódáinsakr are based on a borrowing of Irish motifs by Norse settlers of the Viking Age. While moving to Iceland, many of these settlers spent long periods of time in Britain and Ireland, which in some cases led to a reception of Irish motifs by the Norse.\n\n\n"}

It is a borough constituency for the purposes of election expenses and type of returning officer. As with all constituencies, the election is decided using the first past the post system of election. Since its creation at the 1950 general election, the constituency has, thus far, always elected the candidate nominated by the Conservative Party. This constituency is known for being the one in which the British Parliament, Downing Street and Whitehall are located.\n\nBefore 1950 the City of London formed a two-member constituency on its own. The Boundary Commission for England began reviewing constituencies in January 1946 using rules defined under the Representation of the People Act 1944, which excluded the City of London from the redistribution procedure; the Commission recommended that the borough of Chelsea and the City of Westminster form a single Parliamentary Borough of Chelsea and Westminster with two divisions.\n\nIn February 1948 the Government brought forward a new Representation of the People Bill which removed the right of owners of business premises to a second vote; this would have had the effect of reducing the electorate of the City of London from 12,500 to 4,600. The Bill proposed also to end the City of London as a separate constituency and to merge it with the adjacent boroughs of Finsbury and Shoreditch. During debates on the Bill, the Government amended it to substitute a link between the City of London and the City of Westminster. In introducing the amendment the Home Secretary James Chuter Ede noted that the alterations to the constituencies in Westminster, Chelsea and Kensington had been agreed unanimously at a conference between the Members of Parliament and representatives of the boroughs affected.\n\nThese changes came into force from the 1950 election.\n\nNo alteration was made by the First Periodical Report on constituency boundaries in 1954. In the Second Periodical Report in 1969, the Boundary Commission wrote that their initial feelings were that \"except for a minor alteration to follow a new ward boundary\" they felt that there was \"no reason to disturb\" the constituency, and they received no objections to this proposal. Westminster City Council later suggested that the constituency could be more accurately named as 'The City of London and Westminster South'; the Boundary Commission found opinion divided and left the name unchanged when it published revised proposals for two other constituencies within the City. Subsequent representations on the name were received and the Commission decided that, although justified on historical grounds, the name was \"not now entirely accurate\" and so proposed the renaming as suggested by the City Council.\n\nIn initial proposals during the Third Periodical Review (1983), the Boundary Commission proposed to abolish the St Marylebone constituency and add four wards from it (Cavendish, Baker Street, Bryanston and Regents Park) to the previous City of London and Westminster South constituency; they provisionally named the result 'The City of London and Westminster'. After a local inquiry, the Regents Park ward was removed and Hyde Park ward (from the Paddington constituency) was added; unanimous opinion at the inquiry favoured naming the result 'The City of London and Westminster South'.\n\nFor the Fourth Periodical Review (1995), the Boundary Commission paired the City of Westminster with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea for consideration. The Commission's initial proposals, to expand the constituency by two wards (Bayswater and Lancaster Gate) formerly in Westminster North and to return to the name 'Cities of London and Westminster', were upheld after a local inquiry, despite multiple counter-proposals.\n\nAt the Fifth Periodical Review (in 2007), the initial proposals of the Boundary Commission paired the City of Westminster with the London Borough of Brent although they involved only minor changes to the Cities of London and Westminster constituency to take account of new ward boundaries. Widespread objections (\"almost universal hostility\") to the pairing led to a local inquiry, which decided that Westminster and the City of London should be reviewed separately and not paired with any other borough. The Commission proposed a new Cities of London and Westminster constituency in which the revised Bayswater and Lancaster Gate wards were removed.\n\nEarly proposals made during the initial stages of the postponed Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies proposed linking the City of London to the southern wards of Islington in a constituency to be known as \"The City of London and Islington South\". Most of the Westminster wards were proposed to form part of a Westminster and Kensington constituency. This proposal was the first to suggest a split between the two Cities in Parliamentary elections since they were joined and proved unpopular in consultation; the Boundary Commission revised them to return the link between the City of London and the City of Westminster, although the review was subsequently placed on hiatus.\n\nIn 2016 the Boundary Commission produced a second attempt at the Sixth Periodic Review. Its proposed Cities of London and Westminster comprises the City attached to Regent's Park and Abbey Road to the north-west, Knightsbridge/Belgravia to the west, and Holborn/Covent Garden to the north.\n\nAlthough united for Parliamentary elections, in the London Assembly, the City of London is covered by the City and East constituency, and the area in Westminster by the West Central constituency. The Local Government Commission for England argued that \"combining the City of London with areas to its east could assist in focussing regeneration eastwards\" and linked it with the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, the London Borough of Newham, and the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham.\n\n1950–1974: From the Metropolitan Borough of Westminster: Charing Cross, Covent Garden, Great Marlborough Conduit, Grosvenor, Hamlet of Knightsbridge, Knightsbridge St. George, Pall Mall, Regent, St. Anne, St. John, St. Margaret, Strand.\n\nIn 1959, the boundaries changed, and the wards used instead were Abbey, Alderney, Aldwych, Berkeley, Cathedral, Churchill, Covent Garden, Dolphin, Eaton, Ebury, Grosvenor, Knightsbridge, Millbank, Regent Street, St. James's, Soho, Tachbrook, Victoria, Warwick and Wilton. In 1964, the City of Westminster was created to replace the old Metropolitan Borough of Westminster, which kept the same wards.\n\nThe City of London consisted of Aldersgate, Aldgate, Bassishaw, Bassishaw, Billingsgate, Bishopsgate, Bread Street, Bridge Within, Bridge Without, Broad Street, Candlewick, Castle Baynard, Cheap, Coleman Street, Cordwainer, Cornhill, Cripplegate, Dowgate, Farringdon Within, Farringdon Without, Langbourn, Lime Street, Portsoken, Queenhithe, Tower, Vintry and Walbrook.\n\nIn 1968, the City of Westminster ward boundaries changed, with the following used for this seat: Charing Cross, Churchill, Knightsbridge, Millbank, Regent Street, Victoria Street and Warwick.\n\n1974–1983: The City of Westminster wards as above, and the City of London, as above.\n\nNew boundaries from 1978 meant the following wards from the City of Westminster were used: Baker Street, Belgrave, Bryanston, Cavendish, Churchill, Hyde Park, Knightsbridge, Millbank, St George's, St James's, Victoria, and West End.\n\nIn the City of London, Bridge Within and Bridge Without were combined in 1978 to create Bridge.\n\n1983–1997: The City of Westminster wards as above, and the City of London as above.\n\n1997–2010: The City of Westminster wards as above, plus, Bayswater and Lancaster Gate, and the City of London as above.\n\nIn 2002, a Local Government Boundary Commission for England review abolished the Baker Street, Belgrave, Bryanston, Cavendish, Knightsbridge, Millbank, St James's and Victoria wards.\n\nFor the 2005 general election, the Westminster electoral wards used in this constituency were Bayswater (part), Bryanston and Dorset Square (part), Churchill, Hyde Park, Knightsbridge and Belgravia, Lancaster Gate, Marylebone High Street, St James's, Tachbrook, Vincent Square, Warwick and West End.\n\n2010–present: The City of Westminster wards of Bryanston and Dorset Square, Churchill, Hyde Park, Knightsbridge and Belgravia, Marylebone High Street, St James's, Tachbrook, Vincent Square, Warwick, and West End, and the City of London wards, as above.\n\nThe seat covers the entire City of London and most of the City of Westminster lying South of the Marylebone Road and the Westway. In the latter, more residential, city it covers Westminster, Pimlico, Victoria, Belgravia, Knightsbridge, St. James's, Soho, most of Covent Garden, alongside parts of Fitzrovia, Marylebone, Edgware Road, Paddington and Bayswater.\n\nThe Cities of London and Westminster seat contains the two historical centres of the capital. The City of London is an international financial centre - while Westminster, home to the Houses of Parliament, Whitehall and Downing Street, represents Britain's political centre.\n\nThe seat includes iconic landmarks such as Buckingham Palace and St Paul's Cathedral, the West End's Theatreland and Soho. Some of the country's wealthiest residents live in exclusive Mayfair, Belgravia and Knightsbridge. Less than half the population was born in the UK - a fifth hail from Europe, while one in twenty is American, according to the 2011 Census.\n\nAround half of the electorate are in the more socially mixed areas of Paddington and Pimlico which includes some large council estates (Churchill Gardens\nand Millbank Estate).\n\nThe Westminster City Council wards are heavily represented by the Conservatives; in the most recent elections in 2018 the Labour Party won two seats in the Churchill ward in the constituency, and one in West End ward.\n\nThe constituency also incorporates the City of London Corporation. This includes some of the lowest populated wards in the United Kingdom, such as the Coleman Street ward which has a total electorate of 2 and the Aldgate ward which has a total electorate of 27.\n\n\"Named Cities of London and Westminster from 1997 to date\"\n\n\"Named City of London and Westminster South\" between 1974 and 1992\n\n\"Named from 1950 to 1970 Cities of London and Westminster\"\n\n\n\n"}
