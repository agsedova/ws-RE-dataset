The album was originally set to be released as his major-label debut in 2000 by Columbia Records. However, the album's release was cancelled after Columbia discovered that 50 Cent was struck by nine bullets in a shooting that took place two months before the album was set to release. Because of this, 50 Cent was later dropped from the label. Subsequently, the album was heavily bootlegged. There are currently no plans to release the album on compact disc.\n\nThe album features guest appearances from Destiny's Child, Noreaga, Dave Hollister, Bun B and The Madd Rapper. The album's production was handled by Trackmasters, Red Spyda, Sha Self, DJ Scratch and Erick Sermon, among other producers.\n\nAllmusic writes that the tracks utilize \"penetrating wit and funk-infused beats, accompanied by grand orchestrations of commanding horns, pronounced percussion, and various string elements\".\n\nThe lead single, \"Thug Love\" featuring Destiny's Child, was released on September 21, 1999. Days before 50 Cent was scheduled to film its music video, he was attacked by a gunman in the infamous shooting incident that left him with nine gunshot wounds and gave him his dimple scar; an event that 50 Cent often references in his lyrics. While hospitalized, he signed a publishing deal with Columbia Records. However, he was dropped from the label after it was discovered that he had been shot. The track, \"Ghetto Qu'ran (Forgive Me)\", has been speculated to be the reason for the shooting.\n\nThe third and final single, \"Your Life's on the Line\", was released in 1999. The song was produced by Terrence Dudley, and was perceived as a diss song to Ja Rule, which would begin their highly publicised feud on records. 50 mocks Ja's famous catchphrase \"Murdaa!\", on the chorus of the song, rapping \"Murdaa, I don't believe you/Murdaa, Fuck around and leave you/Murdaa, I don't believe you/Murda Murda, your life's on the line\". A music video for this song was released, which was also the only song with a music video of the whole album. The song would later be included as a bonus track on 50's officially released debut album \"Get Rich or Die Tryin\"'.\n"}

In 1344 he was summoned to Prague from the papal court of Avignon by Charles IV to lead works on the newly founded Saint Vitus Cathedral. He is also widely recognized as the architect of Karlstein Castle, although this fact is not fully authenticated. His involvement in the design of the New Town of Prague is also not completely certain.\n\nWhen Matthias died at Prague in 1352, Saint Vitus Cathedral was not yet completed. The role of its master mason and Charles' head architect fell to then twenty-three years old Peter Parler.\n\n\n"}

The origin of this surname (and its variants: Abitbol and Boutboul) is likely derived from the Hebrew shoresh ט.ב.ל (ṭ.b.l) meaning \"purification in a ritual bath\". The name means \"father of the bath\", \"i.e.\", the one in charge of this ritual bath. In Arabic, it means \"father of the tambourine\" which indicates a profession, \"i.e.\", the maker or salesman of this popular Moroccan musical instrument. The Botbol name is now found in Morocco, France, Belgium, Israel, Canada and South America.\n\nThe Botbol families in Morocco arrived between 1478, persecuted by the Spanish Inquisition, and 1492 when the Catholic Monarchs signed the Alhambra Decree, the edict ordering the expulsion of all Jews from Spain and its possessions. Some of the Botbols may have gone to Antwerp at this time, and become the Botbijl families found there today. Botbols were known in early 16th century Flanders of that era, and were referred to as Maghrebi Jews.\n\nOther variations of the name:\n"}

An enclave within Jerusalem's municipal boundaries and overlooking Bethlehem and Rachel's Tomb (for which the kibbutz is named), it falls under the jurisdiction of Mateh Yehuda Regional Council. In , it had a population of .\n\nAccording to archaeologists, Ramat Rachel \"replaced Jerusalem as the economic and political hub of the southern highlands\" in ancient times.\n\nThe kibbutz was established in 1926 by members of the Gdud HaAvoda labor brigade. Their goal was to settle in Jerusalem and earn their livelihood from manual labor, working in such trades as stonecutting, housing construction and haulage. After living in a temporary camp in Jerusalem, a group of ten pioneers settled on a stony plot of land on an 803-metre high hill south of the city. The kibbutz was destroyed by the Arabs in the riots of 1929. Hundreds of Arabs attacked the training farm and burned it to the ground.\nThe settlers returned to the site a year later. According to a census conducted in 1931 by the British Mandate authorities, Ramat Rachel had a population of 131, in 45 houses.\n\nDuring the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, it was cut off from the city.\n\nIn 1967, it was the target of intensive artillery shelling from Jordanian positions. As the borders of Jerusalem were expanded southward, the kibbutz was surrounded from all sides by the city's municipal borders. In 1990, the kibbutz had a population of 140 adults and 150 children.\n\nThe kibbutz economy is based on hi-tech, tourism and agriculture. Data Detection Technologies, established in 2002, provides advanced counting and packaging solutions for the seed, pharmaceutical and diamond industries based on electro-optic technologies.\nData counters are uniquely appropriate for items that are sold by units and not by weight.\nIn the seed industry, prior to the advent of data seed counters, packaging was accomplished by weight. With the advent of seed counters, items are packaged in units as they are sold.\n\nHotel Mitzpeh Rachel is the only kibbutz hotel in Jerusalem. The hotel, surrounded by gardens, has 108 rooms with a panoramic view of Bethlehem, the Judean Desert and Herodion. The hotel also operates a convention center, tennis courts and a large swimming pool.\n\nThe kibbutz grows cherries, oranges, nectarines, grapefruit, olives, persimmons, figs, pomelos and tangerines.\n\nThe first scientific exploration of the site, known in Arabic as \"Khirbet es-Sallah\", was conducted by Benjamin Mazar and Moshe Stekelis in 1930–1931. In a series of digs in 1959–1962, Yohanan Aharoni tentatively identified it as the biblical Beit Hakerem (Jeremiah 6:1), one of the places from which flaming warning signals were sent to Jerusalem at the end of the First Temple period. Yigael Yadin dated the palace excavated by Aharoni to the reign of Athaliah and identified it as the \"House of Baal\" recorded in 2 Kings 11:18.\n\nOne of many important artifacts discovered at Ramat Rachel are numerous stamp impressions. Among these are LMLK seal impressions. Archaeologist Gabriel Barkay, who excavated the site in 1984, says the ancient name of the site may have been MMST, one of four enigmatic words that appear on the handles.\n\nExcavations resumed in 2004 under the direction of Tel Aviv University archeologists Oded Lipschits and Manfred Oeming. According to Lipschits, the site was a palace or administrative center with a water works system \"unparalleled in Eretz Israel.\" Lipschits says agricultural produce was collected there as a source of government tax revenue.\n\nIn July 2008, archeologists discovered a cooking pot from the 1st century CE containing 15 large gold coins. The pot was found under the floor of a columbarium.\n\nA grove of 200 olive trees planted on the outskirts of the kibbutz leads up to the Olive Columns, three 33-foot high pedestals topped by live olive trees, the work of Israeli artist Ran Morin.\n\nIn the hotel garden is a sculpture of the biblical matriarch Rachel, who personifies the nation. The sculpture is inscribed with a Hebrew Bible verse from Jeremiah 31:17: \"Your children will return to their own land.\" In the Book of Jeremiah, Rachel is depicted as a woman surveying the horizon as though waiting for others.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1941274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941274", "title": "Joseph and Aseneth", "text": "Joseph and Aseneth\n\nJoseph and Aseneth is a narrative that dates from between 200 BCE and 200 CE. The first part of the story (chapters 1-21), an expansion of Genesis 41:45, describes the diffident relationship between Aseneth, the daughter of an Egyptian priest of Heliopolis and the Hebrew patriarch Joseph, the vision of Aseneth in which she is fed honeycomb by a heavenly being, her subsequent conversion to the God of Joseph, followed by romance, marriage, and birth of Manasseh and Ephraim. The second part (chapters 22-29) involves a plot by the Pharaoh's son, who recruits Dan and Gad to kill Joseph, only to be thwarted by Benjamin and Levi.\n\nThe work was composed in Greek, attested by sixteen Greek manuscripts, and other sources. The oldest existing manuscript is a Syriac translation, contained in British Library manuscript #17,202, an anthology that contains a variety of writings. The Syriac translation of \"Joseph and Aseneth\" was made around 550 CE by Moses of Ingila. The anthology was compiled around 570 CE by an individual whom scholars call \"Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor.\"\n\nSome have regarded it as a Jewish midrash or elaboration on the story in Genesis (Genesis 37–50). Others question this interpretation partly because of its provenance (early Syriac Christianity), language (Son of God, Bride of God), symbolism (Eucharistic) and covering letter which appear to indicate a Christian context. Gideon Bohak and others have drawn attention to the geographical location of the story (Heliopolis) and an important Jewish diaspora community centered on a Jewish temple in Leontopolis, located in the nome of Heliopolis during the Ptolemaic period, seeing this as the likely starting point.\n\nIn 1870 J.P.N. Land published a transcription of \"Joseph and Aseneth\" in the third series of \"Anecdota Syriaca\", using British Library manuscript #17,202.\n\nThe British Library acquired manuscript #17,202 from the British Museum. That institution purchased it on November 11, 1847, from an Egyptian merchant by the name of Auguste Pacho, a native of Alexandria. It had come from an ancient Syrian monastery, St. Mary Deipara, in the Nitrian desert in Egypt, where it had been housed for over 900 years.\n\nAround 932, the monastery's abbot, Moses the Nisibene, acquired over 250 manuscripts from Mesopotamia and Syria for the library. One of these is the manuscript we know as British Library #17,202.\n\nFrom the 10th century back to the 6th century the manuscript was in Mesopotamia. In the 6th century we can pick up the trail. Manuscript #17,202 is an anthology, a collection of a number of important writings compiled by an anonymous Syriac author called by scholars Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor. He labelled his anthology \"A Volume of Records of Events Which Have Happened in the World\". He was likely a monk.\nThis Syriac anthology dates from around 570. It contains the oldest existing version of \"Joseph and Aseneth\".\n\nThe compiler is called \"Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor\" because one of the items found in his anthology is an important church history by the real Zacharias Rhetor. Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor, whoever he was, did not compose these documents: he compiled them. In the case of \"Joseph and Aseneth\" he used the existing Syriac translation that had been made by Moses of Ingila.\n\nTwo covering letters to \"Joseph and Aseneth\" are included in the compilation and they record how this Syriac translation came to be made. An anonymous Syriac individual, probably a monk, had been looking at manuscripts in Resh'aina (near the border of modern-day Turkey and Syria) in a library belonging to the line of bishops who had come from Aleppo. This individual came across what he termed \"a small, very old book\" written in Greek \"\"Of Aseneth\".\" The covering letter asks Moses of Ingila to translate it into Syriac, his Greek being rather rusty, and to tell him its \"inner meaning\".\n\nThe second covering letter provides Moses of Ingila's response. He says that the writing is a piece of wisdom literature whose inner meaning has to be carefully discerned. He cautions the anonymous monk to be careful. As he is about to disclose its Christological meaning affirming Christianity, the text is cut off.\nIn 1918 E.W. Brooks published a translation and introduction to \"Joseph and Aseneth\" in which he wrote the following: \"that the book in its present shape is the work of a Christian writer will be at once recognized by any reader.\"\n\nTwo English anthologies of Old Testament Apocrypha/Pseudepigrapha include translations of \"Joseph and Aseneth\", all based on Greek manuscripts later than the oldest extant Syriac version. An introduction and translation by C. Burchard is included in James H. Charlesworth's \"The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha\", volume 2. Similarly H.F.D. Sparks includes a translation by D. Cook in his \"The Apocryphal Old Testament\". The inclusion of \"Joseph and Aseneth\" in these anthologies seem to suggest that the editors and translators were under the impression that the author was Jewish and that the work had something to do with Jewish apocryphal literature.\n\nThis accords with Burchard's judgment in 1985. He writes: \"Every competent scholar has since Batiffol has maintained that \"Joseph and Aseneth\" is Jewish, with perhaps some Christian interpolations; no one has put the book much after A.D. 200, and some have placed it as early as the second century B.C. As to the place of origin, the majority of scholars look to Egypt.\"\n\nA list of extant manuscripts and 20th century interpretation history can be found in the introductions to these two anthologies. Views as to origin include: written in Israel by an Orthodox Jew (Aptowitzer); in Israel written by an Essene (Riessler); in Alexandria Egypt composed by a member of the Therapeutae (K.G. Kuhn); and also in Egypt relating to the Jewish temple in the nome of Heliopolis (founded c. 170 BCE), in the same area as the geographical setting of the story (Bohak). Cook endorsed the view of an earlier French scholar, Marc Philonenko, who thought that it was written by a Jewish author around 100 CE. Its purpose, he maintained was twofold: to present inter-faith marriages between Gentiles and Jews in a positive light, and, secondly, to persuade Jews as to the advantages of such unions. Cook thought that this view was \"likely.\"\n\nAll these authors contended that the author was Jewish and written around the dawn of the 1st century CE. And the anthologizers Charlesworth and Sparks seem to concur, with Charlesworth labelling the translation, \"First Century B.C. – Second Century A.D.\"\nThe contention that the work is Jewish in origin, however, is no longer maintained in recent scholarship.\n\nRecently some scholars have argued that the work is fundamentally Christian. These include Ross Shepard Kraemer, \"When Aseneth Met Joseph\"; Rivka Nir, \"Joseph and Aseneth: A Christian Book\". \n\nAccording to Angela Standhartinger, a covering letter by Moses of Ingila included with the manuscript explains the story \"as an allegory of Christ's marriage to the soul\".\n\nA recent book by Simcha Jacobovici and Barrie Wilson, \"The Lost Gospel: Decoding the Ancient Text that Reveals Jesus' Marriage to Mary the Magdalene\", argues for the marriage of Jesus to Mary Magdalene through a decoding of \"Joseph and Aseneth\", according to the Jesus bloodline myth. The book has been thoroughly debunked by scholars and compared to \"The Da Vinci Code\" in 2003, as a conspiracy theory. \n\nThe authors claim that the story of Joseph and Aseneth was already composed during Jesus' lifetime and precedes the canonical gospels.\n\nThe Syriac manuscript, being the oldest manuscript, and its accompanying cover letters are given great weight; the authors commissioned multi-spectral photography to \"see through\" smudges and other marks on the manuscript to ascertain the original underlying text. The translation into English was by Tony Burke, translator of The Infancy Gospel of Thomas, author of \"Secret Scriptures Revealed\", and editor of \"Fakes, Forgeries, and Fictions: Writing Ancient and Modern Christian Apocrypha\". Burke worked independently and was not informed of the overall project objectives. Burke also prepared the first-ever English translation of the two covering letters in Syriac, which was more difficult than translating the main text, owing to damage to the manuscript.\n"}

In 1990, she established \"Nrityagram\", a dance village near Bangalore.\n\nProtima was born in Delhi, the second of the four siblings, three daughters and a son. Her father Laxmichand Gupta, a trader belonging to a business family from Karnal district, Haryana, and her mother Reba, a Bengali. Her father had to leave home, because of opposition to his marriage, Thereafter, he started working in Delhi.\n\nIn 1953, her family moved to Goa, and in 1957 to Bombay. At age nine, she was sent to stay at her aunt's, in a village in Karnal district for a while, where she studied in a local school. On her return, she was sent to Kimmins High School, Panchgani, where she received her early education. She graduated from St. Xavier's College, Bombay (1965–67).\n\nBy the late 1960s, she was a prominent model. In 1974, she came into the news for streaking during the daytime for the launch of the Bollywood magazine, \"Cineblitz\" at Juhu Beach in Bombay.\n\nIn August 1975, at the age of 26, an Odissi dance recital completely changed her life when she ran into the Bhulabhai Memorial Institute by chance, and saw two young dancers giving an Odissi performance. It filled her with a kind of passion she'd never known before, in spite of its extremely complex rhythms, patterns and sophisticated hand-and-eye gestures. She became a student of Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra from whom she learnt the art of dancing for 12 to 14 hours a day and faced a lot of hardship as a beginner. She transformed herself from being the tight trouser, halter neck, off-shoulder girl with gold streaked hair to Protima Gauri, later as Gauri Amma or Gauri Maa, as she was affectionately known amongst her students.\n\nTo her dance was a way of life. She proved to be an excellent learner. To perfect her dance, she started studying abhinaya from Guru Kalanidhi Narayan of Madras. From then on, she started giving performances all over the country. Around the same time, Protima started her own dance school at Prithvi Theatre in Juhu, Mumbai. It later became the Odissi Dance Centre. After her separation from Kabir Bedi in 1978, she was looking for an anchor and she found it in her dance.\n\nNrityagram, situated on the outskirts of Bangalore, became India's first free dance gurukul, village for various Indian classical dances, consisting of seven gurukuls for the seven classical dance styles and two martial arts forms, Chhau and Kalaripayattu. She wanted to revive the guru-shishya parampara in the right kind of environment. Nrityagram was inaugurated on 11 May 1990, by the then Prime Minister, V.P. Singh. The dance school has a small community of students from all parts of India, but with a common aim - dance. The Nrityagram ensemble was soon performing all over the world. Meanwhile, in 1992, she appeared in Pamela Rooks's English film, \"Miss Beatty's Children\" .\n\nNrityagram, created as a model dance village, was constructed by master architect, Gerard da Cunha. It had even won the Best Rural Architecture' award in 1991. To raise funds to run Nrityagram, a tourist resort Kuteeram was built in 1992. Nrityagram is also the venue of the annual dance festival Vasanta Habba, which was first started in 1994 and had 40,000 visitors when it was last held in 2004. It has not been held from 2005–2007, due to the advent of the 2004 tsunami and a shortage of funds.\n\nProtima's son Siddarth who was suffering from schizophrenia, committed suicide in July 1997, while he was studying in North Carolina, this changed the course of her life irrevocably, as in early 1998, she announced her retirement and changed her name to Protima Gauri, soon she started travelling in the Himalayan region, starting with Leh. In a newspaper interview given in April, 1997, camping at Rishikesh during the Kumbh Mela, she said, \"I have decided to give myself up to the Himalayas. It is the call of the mountains which has beckoned me to them. And who knows what may come out of it? It is bound to be something good,\" Subsequently, in August, Protima Gauri set off on her pilgrimage to Kailash Mansarovar and it was there that she disappeared after the Malpa landslide, near Pithoragarh, in the Himalayas, leaving behind her most lasting achievement — a flourishing dance village, Nrityagram, where students continue to learn the classical dance styles of India. Her remains and belongings were later recovered after several days along with seven other bodies as remains of a landslide in Malpa, a village near the India-Nepal border.\n\nIn her autobiography, \"Timepass\", based on her journals and letters, collated and published by her daughter, Pooja Bedi in 2000, she gives a candid account of all her relationships, her rebellious lifestyle, her family life, the birth of her dream project, Nrityagram, and her eventual transition into a sanyasin, towards the end of her life, when she retired from public life and wanted to explore the Himalayas.\n\nProtima Bedi, during her modelling days, met Kabir Bedi. And after a few months, she walked out of her parents' house to live with him. It was another indication of her expression of individuality, which continued throughout her life. She married Kabir and had two children - Pooja Bedi and Siddharth Bedi.\n\n\n\n"}

He worked as a reporter for the \"Kansas City Star\" for a time.\n\nIn 1924, Berger moved to New York, where he worked as a reporter and editor for ten years. In 1928, he began writing juvenile books, making his debut with \"Captain Bib,\" which was published in 1929. He published a total of twenty books, in addition to writing short stories and articles for publications such as \"Atlantic Monthly, The New Yorker, Esquire, Reader's Digest, McCall's,\" and \"The New York Times Sunday Magazine.\"\n\nIn 1934, he settled with his wife and daughter in Provincetown, Massachusetts where he tried to make it as a freelance writer. Berger had a hard time earning money and for about year lived in poverty until he found a job with the government-sponsored Federal Writer's Project. His 1937 \"Cape Cod Pilot\" became a success and enabled him to obtain a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship the next year, which he used to write \"In Great Waters,\" a history of the Portuguese in New England. He received another Guggenheim Fellowship in 1946.\n\nBerger, who wrote under the pen name Jeremiah Digges, went to Washington, D.C. in 1940 to become the editor of reports for the U.S. House of Representative Select Committee to Investigate Interstate Migration of Destitute Citizens. In 1941 he worked in the same capacity for the U.S. Senate Committee on Wartime Health and Education.\n\nBerger was employed by the United States Department of Justice in 1942 as a speech-writer for the Attorney-General, Francis Biddle. From 1944–1947, he worked as chief speechwriter for the Democratic National Committee, where he was a special assistant to its chairman Robert E. Hannegan, and prepared speeches for him, as well as for various Democratic politicians, such as Harry Truman, Tom Clark, Henry Wallace, Lyndon Johnson, Sam Rayburn and Estes Kefauver. He also wrote a speech for Franklin D. Roosevelt Although the president died the day before the speech was scheduled, the speech was subsequently published and widely quoted. Berger also served as chief of press relations for the Allied Commission on Reparations in London, Paris, Berlin, Pottsdam, and Moscow during 1945. Between 1947 and 1950 he wrote scripts for daytime television shows. In 1950, he became a chief speechwriter for the March of Dimes, and from 1955–1968 its chief speechwriter.\n\nHe continued with free-lance writing throughout his life. His production also covered poetry and song lyrics, including a record called The Babysitters with Alan Arkin and Lee Hays. From 1960–1962, he wrote for \"The New York Times Magazine, McCall's,\" and others.\n\nHe also wrote a book named \"Bowleg Bill, The Sea-Going Cowboy\"\n\nThe Venona project has revealed that Berger was approached by the KGB after a lead by Samuel Krafsur. In a KGB message to Moscow in 1945, he is described as a progressive and as well disposed toward the Soviet Union. According to Krafsur, Berger had expressed a wish to live in the USSR and maintained contacts with the Communist Party USA. There is no indication, however, that he was actually recruited as an agent. The fact that he quit government work soon afterwards may indicate that the plans to recruit him came to nothing, or even that he wished to avoid involvement in espionage.\n\nAt the age of 67, he died suddenly of an aneurysm on November 11, 1971 in New York City.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1941290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941290", "title": "The Science of Life", "text": "The Science of Life\n\nThe Science of Life is a book written by H. G. Wells, Julian Huxley and G. P. Wells, published in three volumes by The Waverley Publishing Company Ltd in 1929–30, giving a popular account of all major aspects of biology as known in the 1920s. It has been called \"the first modern textbook of biology\" and \"the best popular introduction to the biological sciences\". Wells's most recent biographer notes that \"The Science of Life\" \"is not quite as dated as one might suppose\".\n\nIn undertaking \"The Science of Life,\" H. G. Wells, who had published \"The Outline of History\" a decade earlier, selling over two million copies, desired the same sort of treatment for biology. He thought of his readership as \"the intelligent lower middle classes ... [not] idiots, half-wits ... greenhorns, religious fanatics ... smart women or men who know all that there is to be known\".\n\nJulian Huxley, the grandson of T. H. Huxley under whom Wells had studied biology, and his son \"Gip\", a zoologist, divided the initial writing between them; H. G. Wells revised, dealt (with the help of his literary agent, A. P. Watt) with publishers, and acted as a strict taskmaster, often obliging his collaborators to sit down and work together and keeping them on a tight schedule. (H. G. Wells had begun the book during his wife's final illness and is said to have used work on the book as a way to keep his mind off his loss.)\n\nThe text as published is presented as the common work of a \"triplex author\". H. G. Wells took 40% of the royalties; the remainder was split between Huxley and Wells's son. In his will, H. G. Wells left his rights in the book to G. P. Wells.\n\nIn 1927, Huxley gave up his chair of Zoology at King's College, London to concentrate on the work. Thanks to the success of the book, Huxley was able to give up teaching and devote himself to administration and experimental science.\n\nThe book was originally serialised in 31 fortnightly parts, published in 3 volumes in 1929–30 and in a single volume in 1931. The volume includes more than 300 illustrations. It was a great success, though the stock market crash and subsequent depression held back sales, in part because of declining memberships in book clubs.\n\nIt has been said of Book Four (\"The How and Why of Development and Evolution\") that it \"offers perhaps the clearest, most readable, succinct and informative popular account of the subject ever penned. It was here that [Huxley] first expounded his own version of what later developed into the evolutionary synthesis\".\n\n\"The Science of Life\" is also notable for its introduction of modern ecological concepts. It is also notable for its emphasis on the importance of behaviorism and Jung's psychology. Toward the end \"The Science of Life\" strays from the scientific to the moral realm and devotes a chapter (Book Eight, Ch. VIII: \"Modern Ideas of Conduct\") to practical moral advice to the reader, advising him (the masculine pronoun is used throughout, a universal practice circa 1930): \"After his primary duties to himself, the first duty of Mr. Everyman to others is to learn about himself, to acquire poise and make his persona as much of a cultivated gentleman as he can. He has to be considerate. He has to be trustworthy.\" In its last pages, Wells emphasises the lack of \"credibility\" of personal immortality, and advocates \"realization of [one's] participation in a greater being with which he identifies himself\", whether this be \"the Deity\" or \"Man\".\n\n\"The Science of Life: a summary of contemporary knowledge about life and its possibilities\" was first issued in 31 fortnightly parts published by Amalgamated Press in 1929–30, bound up in three volumes as publication proceeded. A mail-order version of the book was also published, though this was dropped after the stock market crash. It was first issued in one volume by Cassell in 1931, and reprinted in 1934 and 1937; a popular edition, fully revised, with a new preface by H. G. Wells, appeared in 1938. It was again published as separate volumes by Cassell in 1934–1937: I \"The living body\". II \"Patterns of life\" (1934). III \"Evolution—fact and theory\". IV \"Reproduction, heredity and the development of sex\". V \"The history and adventure of life\". VI \"The drama of life\". VII \"How animals behave\" (1937). VIII \"Man's mind and behaviour\". IX \"Biology and the human race\". In New York, it was published by Doubleday, Doran & Co. in 1931, 1934 and 1939; and by The Literary Guild in 1934. Three of the Cassell spin-off books were also published by Doubleday in 1932: \"Evolution, fact and theory\"; \"The human mind and the behaviour of Man\"; \"Reproduction, genetics and the development of sex\". \"The Science of Life\" was translated into French. During World War II a one-volume edition designed for use in military classes was issued. As late as 1960 the work was still being used in college classes in the US\n\nOf historic interest is \"Book Three – The Incontrovertible Fact of Evolution\", comprising five chapters; I. The fact to be proved, II. The evidence in the rocks, III. The evidence from plant and animal structure, IV. The evidence from the variation and distribution of living things, V. The evolution of Man. Considering that this was written less than five years from the Scopes Trial, it is a bold, comprehensive account of the scientific knowledge of evolution at the time. Book Four concentrates on the controversies about evolution concluding that \"the broad positions of Darwinism emerge from a scrutiny of the most exacting sort, essentially unchanged\".\n\nThe section entitled \"The Ecological Outlook\" anticipates many of the themes of the later green movement, including stressing the importance of reducing pollution and protecting endangered species from extinction, as well as the importance of alternative power sources.\n\nThe reference given is the most complete available, but there may have been other publishers and dates, and some books may have been given alternative titles.

{"id": "1941291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941291", "title": "Barry Letts", "text": "Barry Letts\n\nBarry Leopold Letts (26 March 1925 – 9 October 2009) was an English actor, television director, writer and producer, best known for being the producer of \"Doctor Who\" from 1969 to 1974. \n\nBorn in Leicester, he worked as an actor in theatre, films and television before retiring in his early forties and becoming a television director. He then became the producer of the BBC science fiction series \"Doctor Who\" for five years, overseeing almost the entirety of Jon Pertwee's tenure as the Third Doctor and casting Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor. He produced or directed many of the BBC's Sunday Classic drama serials from 1976 to 1986, and returned to \"Doctor Who\" in 1980 to be the executive producer for its eighteenth season.\n\n\"The Guardian\" described Letts on his death as \"a pioneer of British television\" who \"served the medium for more than half a century\" and \"secured his place in TV history\" with \"Doctor Who\". He was associated with the series for many years, with active involvement in the television programme from 1967 to 1981 (as a director, producer, executive producer and writer) and with later contributions to its spin-offs in other media. \n\nLetts was an assistant stage manager at Leicester's Theatre Royal in his teens and took up the job full-time after leaving Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys. His initial work was as a repertory actor, following his service as a Sub-Lieutenant in the Royal Navy during the Second World War. He later played one of the leading characters in the Terence Fisher directed film, \"To the Public Danger\", a heartfelt plea against dangerous driving. He also appeared in the highly regarded Ealing Studios productions, \"Scott of the Antarctic\" and \"The Cruel Sea\", in supporting roles.\n\nFrom 1950 he appeared in various live television productions including \"Gunpowder Guy\" (broadcast on 5 November 1950) in which future \"Doctor Who\" actor Patrick Troughton played Guy Fawkes and Letts a fellow conspirator. He also appeared as Colonel Herncastle in the 1959 television adaptation of Wilkie Collins's novel \"The Moonstone\", and played roles in \"The Last Man Out\" and \"The Avengers\".\n\nMuch of his television work was for the BBC. Letts gave up his acting career after completing the BBC's director's course. His early directorial work included episodes of the long-running police drama \"Z-Cars\" and a soap opera, \"The Newcomers\".\n\nLetts' first involvement with \"Doctor Who\" was in 1967 when he directed the Patrick Troughton serial \"The Enemy of the World\". This was a complex serial to direct as Troughton played both the Doctor and the dictator \"Salamander\" in the same story and sometimes in the same scenes – a rare and demanding directorial requirement for the 1960s. However, in his memoir \"Who and Me\", Letts related how he naively used matte boxes to allow Troughton to act face to face with himself, when in fact optical printing was already available and the same could have been accomplished in post-production.\n\nHe became the series' producer in October 1969, replacing Derrick Sherwin, with Jon Pertwee recently cast as the Doctor. Letts' first story as producer was Pertwee's second, \"Doctor Who and the Silurians\", and he remained the producer for the rest of the Pertwee serials, becoming the father figure in the 'family' atmosphere that had developed on the show at that time. It was an era of substantial change for \"Doctor Who\", with episodes broadcast in colour for the first time and an improved budget which enabled more location filming and action sequences than had previously been possible. Letts also embraced the technological innovations which came with moving the series into colour, most notably his enthusiasm for Colour Separation Overlay. He also oversaw the celebration of the programme's tenth anniversary in 1973, uniting the first three Doctors in the first multiple Doctor story, \"The Three Doctors\".\n\nWhen he took over, a recent BBC decision had cut the season length from over 40 episodes a year to 26. Notable changes Letts made, as related in his autobiography \"Who and Me\", included producing the show in two-episode blocks, rather than as separate episodes: rehearsing two episodes for a fortnight, and then recording those two episodes back-to-back, thereby reducing the demands on the studio scenic crews, who only had to erect and strike the sets once a fortnight instead of once a week. This was a profoundly significant change: it allowed much more rehearsal time, in a much less frantic atmosphere; it ended a long running dispute with the unions representing the technical crews; it reduced wear-and-tear on the sets (and the budget allocations for repairing the damage); and it meant that, forever after, serials could only be made in multiples of 2 episodes -- a primary reason for the 4-episode and 6-episode format dominating the schedules for the following fifteen years. He also retired the original \"howl-around\" title sequence used, with variations, from 1963 until 1973, introducing as its replacement the classic \"time tunnel\" special effects sequence which would run, until 1980, behind the opening and closing credits for every episode produced in seasons 11 to 17.\n\nWhen he was offered the chance to become producer on the series, Letts made it a condition that he be allowed to also continue to direct. The Head of Serials agreed to this, and Letts directed three \"Doctor Who\" serials during his time as producer: \"Terror of the Autons\", \"Carnival of Monsters\" and \"Planet of the Spiders\". Letts also directed most of the studio scenes for \"Inferno\" after Douglas Camfield was taken ill during the production. Letts's final work as a director on the series was when he returned in 1975 to direct \"The Android Invasion\" during the era of Philip Hinchcliffe as producer.\n\nLetts formed a particularly close partnership with two other contributors to the programme: Terrance Dicks, who was the script editor on the programme between 1968 and 1974; and playwright Robert Sloman, with whom Letts co-wrote four serials in the Pertwee era: \"The Dæmons\" (credited under the pen-name Guy Leopold); \"The Time Monster\"; \"The Green Death\"; and \"Planet of the Spiders\", which was Pertwee's swansong. Letts later provided an official obituary for Sloman in December 2005, published in \"The Guardian\". Letts was a Buddhist and also held liberal political views. According to Toby Hadoke, who contributed to his \"Guardian\" obituary, \"Letts's liberal worldview led him to commission stories with contemporary resonance – eco-parables, critiques on colonialism and apartheid, even entry into the Common Market (the Galactic Federation in \"Doctor Who\" parlance) were all presented within a format of child-friendly derring-do.\"\n\nOne of Letts' final tasks as producer was to cast Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor. Baker was recommended to him by Bill Slater, an experienced former director who was then serving as the Head of Serials at the BBC. After one story with Baker, \"Robot\", Letts left the position of producer in 1974, having been the longest serving producer on the programme until that time.\n\nIn 1980, he returned to \"Doctor Who\" to be executive producer during John Nathan-Turner's first season as producer, between \"The Leisure Hive\" and Tom Baker's final story, \"Logopolis\". Letts' return to the programme was because Nathan-Turner had not previously been either a director or producer, and a restructuring of the BBC Drama Department meant that Head of Series and Serials Graeme MacDonald was unable to offer the support previous producers had received. As it happened, 'JNT' (as he was known) stayed for nine years, overtaking Letts as the longest serving producer on \"Doctor Who\". When the programme returned in 2005, Letts was involved in the hectic round of interviews to promote the show, appearing for a lengthy discussion piece on \"The Daily Politics\" with Andrew Neill on BBC2.\n\nLetts also wrote the scripts for two radio plays based on the show, starring Jon Pertwee with Nicholas Courtney as the Brigadier and Elizabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane, broadcast in the 1990s: \"The Paradise of Death\" and \"The Ghosts of N-Space\". He wrote the novelisations of the TV story \"The Dæmons\" (Target Books, 1974) and of both of his radio plays \"The Paradise of Death\" (Target, 1994) and \"The Ghosts of N-Space\" (Virgin Books, 1995, published as part of the Virgin Missing Adventures line). He also wrote two original \"Doctor Who\" novels published by BBC Books: \"Deadly Reunion\" (co-written with Terrance Dicks, 2003) and \"Island of Death\" (2005). He, like Terrance Dicks, also wrote radio dramas for the \"Big Finish\" company's series of productions starring Elizabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith, released on CD.\n\nIn June 2008 he recorded a long in-vision interview covering his entire career, and his \"Doctor Who\" years in particular, excerpts of which continued to be widely used on future DVD releases, most notably on an obituary documentary \"Remembering Barry Letts\" which was included on the BBC DVD release of \"The Dæmons\". He continued to record commentaries and interviews for DVD releases of his \"Doctor Who\" episodes until shortly before his death in 2009. \n\nHis involvement with \"Doctor Who\" was far wider than simply his professional work of writing, directing and producing the show. He frequently gave interviews, attended conventions, and made personal appearances in connection with the show and his work on it and indeed other aspects of his career. He enjoyed a lifelong friendship with Terrance Dicks, established in 1969, and they frequently attended events as a team.\n\nLetts' work on the show is inextricably linked with the character of the Third Doctor, as played by Jon Pertwee. With the exceptions of \"The Enemy of the World\", \"Robot\", \"The Android Invasion\" and his one season as executive producer in 1980–81, every \"Doctor Who\" story regardless of media in which Letts has been involved – whether as producer, director or writer – involved this version of the character.\n\nHis other work included producing and co-creating the tv series \"Moonbase 3\" with Terrance Dicks in 1973.\n\nAfter leaving \"Doctor Who\" he remained with the BBC, doing a mixture of directing and producing. He directed for numerous series and serials (including on \"Doctor Who\" in 1975), before settling into the role of producer of the BBC's Sunday classic serials (where he appointed his friend and former \"Doctor Who\" collaborator, Terrance Dicks, as his script editor). He oversaw more than 25 serials in this capacity, over an 8-year period, including \"Nicholas Nickleby\", \"Great Expectations\", \"A Tale of Two Cities\", \"Dombey and Son\", \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" (starring Tom Baker), \"The Invisible Man\", \"Pinocchio\", \"Gulliver in Lilliput\", \"Alice in Wonderland\", \"Lorna Doone\", \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\", \"The Children of the New Forest\", \"Beau Geste\" and \"Sense and Sensibility\". Many actors with whom he had worked on \"Doctor Who\" were to feature in these classic serials, including Tom Baker, Elizabeth Sladen, Caroline John, and Paul Darrow.\n\nHis final directing work was on the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\" which he worked on periodically from 1990 to 1992. He also taught directing for the BBC at Elstree Studios.\n\nHe had a small cameo role in the film \"Exodus\", broadcast on UK Channel 4.\n\nHis autobiography, \"Who and Me\", was published posthumously in November 2009, then released as a talking book on CD, read by Letts himself, and later broadcast on BBC Radio 7.\n\nLetts suffered from cancer for many years before his death. His wife, Muriel, had died earlier in the year. Letts was survived by his three children: Dominic, Crispin and Joanna. His sons, Dominic and Crispin, had followed him into the acting profession.\n\nFollowing Letts’ death, Tom Baker was interviewed for BBC Radio 4’s \"Last Word\" to pay tribute. He described Letts as \"the big link in changing my entire life\". \"Doctor Who\" executive producer Russell T. Davies also wrote a personal tribute to him in issue No.415 of \"Doctor Who Magazine\".\n\nThe November 2009 \"Doctor Who\" episode \"The Waters of Mars\" was dedicated to his memory. Issue No.417 of \"Doctor Who Magazine\" included a 12-page tribute to Letts and featured contributions from former colleagues including Frazer Hines, Mary Peach, Terrance Dicks, Nicholas Courtney, Graeme Harper, Katy Manning, Christopher Barry, Elisabeth Sladen and Tom Baker.\n\nIt had been intended for Letts to attend the Doctor Who Appreciation Society's convention 'Time and Again' at Riverside Studios in Hammersmith that year, until it became clear his health would not allow this. He died shortly before the convention and as a small tribute the end credits of the recently recoloured \"Planet of the Daleks\" Part Three, shown at the event, were changed to end with an 'In Memory of Barry Letts 1925-2009' caption.\n\n"}

He enlisted for service with the Royal Garrison Regiment, but relinquished this appointment in June 1902.\n\nIn 1902, French's father cut him off financially when he married Annabelle Angus, the daughter of an innkeeper in Banffshire, Scotland, and the divorced wife of a brother officer, one Captain Alexander. The marriage was childless, though Annabelle brought a son to the marriage—Ronald True, who was convicted of murder in 1922 and spent the remainder of his life in Broadmoor Hospital. \n\nUnable to keep himself in the style to which a British officer was accustomed, French resigned his commission. He sailed on the steamship \"Umbria\" for the United States, where he intended either to join the North-West Mounted Police or to travel to the ranch of his uncle William French in Frenchtown near Cimarron, New Mexico.\n\nLanding in New York in mid-January 1905, French checked into the Hotel St. Denis at 799 Broadway at 11th. By the 19th he had disappeared from the hotel, leaving his substantial and expensive baggage behind. An uproar began, involving the New York City Police and the British consulate, which was widely reported in the press. In mid-February he was discovered nearby, at Fort Slocum, an island post in Long Island Sound just off New Rochelle. On 24 January he had enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army, and was assigned to A Company, the 8th Infantry Regiment at Slocum, where he had reported 1 February. Known as “the Dook of Fort Slocum”, he was popular with the other troops, sponsoring dinners for his colleagues on post by selling his civilian suits.\n\nFrench remained with the regiment when it transferred to the Philippines, where he remained and enlisted several more times, although, contrary to legend, he remained a private throughout his American service. On September 10, 1913, his father died, and French inherited the title of Baron de Freyne, so in Mindanao on October 19 of that year, he purchased his way out of his American enlistment, a common and standard practice from 1890 to 1940.\n\nFrench rejoined the British Army at the outbreak of the First World War and died on May 9, 1915, aged thirty-five, probably at about 16:00 hours, in the Battle of Aubers Ridge, fighting alongside his half-brother, the Hon. George Philip French, as a captain in the 3rd Battalion, South Wales Borderers. He is buried in the Cabaret-Rouge British Cemetery, Souchez, Pas-de-Calais, France.\n\nHe was succeeded as Baron de Freyne by another half-brother, Francis Charles French. His widow died in 1962.\n\n"}

The Tomatoes managed a couple of EPs, including \"Acton Baby\" and the four-track CD \"Hormones and Hangovers\". The Tomatoes split in the early 1990s, and a splinter group emerged. Sugar Snatch took inspiration for their songs from cartoons, namely \"Asterix\" and \"Animaniacs\". One album, \"Mad Cows and Englishmen\", was released amidst much touring of the UK and Europe, often playing the supporting slot to Toy Dolls. Seemingly going nowhere, the band split, though two of the members went on to form The Yo-Yos, a punkabilly band formed by Danny McCormack after the 1997 split of The Wildhearts. Although signed and promoted heavily, the band never really took off, and they too split after recording a debut album.\n\nAll this while, Andy had been working with Raymond Watts (also known as PIG) and toured Japan with the band.

He was a published ornithologist, philatelist, conchologist, sports enthusiast, and self-styled wrestling coach. He died in prison while serving a sentence of 30 years for the murder of Dave Schultz.\n\nIn 1972, du Pont founded and directed the Delaware Museum of Natural History and contributed to Villanova University and other institutions. In the 1980s, he established a wrestling facility at his Foxcatcher Farm after becoming interested in the sport and the pentathlon events. He became a prominent supporter of amateur sports in the United States and a sponsor of USA Wrestling.\n\nIn the 1990s, friends and acquaintances were concerned about his erratic and paranoid behavior, but his wealth shielded him. On February 25, 1997, he was convicted of murder in the third degree for the January 26, 1996, shooting death of Dave Schultz, an Olympic champion freestyle wrestler living and working on du Pont's estate. He was ruled to have been mentally ill but not insane and was sentenced to prison for 13 to 30 years. He died in prison at age 72 on December 9, 2010. To date he is the only member of the Forbes 400 richest Americans to be convicted of murder.\n\nJohn du Pont was born on November 22, 1938, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the youngest of four children of William du Pont, Jr. and Jean Liseter Austin (1897–1988). He grew up at Liseter Hall, a mansion built in 1922 in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, by his maternal grandfather on more than 80 hectare (200 acres) of land given to his parents at their wedding by his maternal grandfather. Both his parents' families had emigrated from Europe to the United States at the beginning of the 19th century and became highly successful.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the couple acquired more land and developed Liseter Hall Farm for Thoroughbred breeding, showing, and racing. His mother retained Liseter Hall Farm after the couple divorced in 1941. She added a dairy herd of Guernseys and bred Welsh ponies at the farm. John was 2 when his parents divorced. He had two older sisters, Jean and Evelyn, an older brother Henry E. I. du Pont, and a younger half brother, William du Pont III, born of their father's second marriage.\n\nDu Pont graduated from Haverford School in 1957. He attended the University of Pennsylvania where he belonged to the Zeta Psi fraternity, and withdrew before completing his freshman year. Du Pont later attended college in Miami, Florida, where he studied under and was mentored by scientist Oscar T. Owre. He graduated from the University of Miami in 1965 with a Bachelor of Science degree in zoology. Du Pont went on to complete a doctorate in natural science from Villanova University in 1973.\n\nDuring an October 2015 podcast, Mark Schultz revealed that when John was about thirty years old, a horse he was riding threw him onto a fence, resulting in injury to his testicles. They became infected and had to be removed, resulting in androgynous characteristics for the remainder of his life.\n\nDuring his graduate work, du Pont participated in several scientific expeditions to study and identify species of birds in the Philippines and South Pacific. As an ornithologist, du Pont is credited with the discovery of two dozen species of birds. He founded the Delaware Museum of Natural History in 1957. As a young man, he served on the board, helping guide the institution toward opening in 1972. After having been part of scientific expeditions, he served as director of the museum for many years.\n\nAt the age of 45, on September 3, 1983, du Pont married 29-year-old Gale Wenk, an occupational therapist. They met after he injured his hand in an auto accident. They lived together for less than six months. Du Pont filed for divorce when they had been married for ten months. Wenk sued du Pont for $5 million, claiming he had pointed a gun at her and tried to push her into a fireplace. The divorce became final in 1987. Du Pont's will excluded her from inheriting any of his estate. In 1987, it was estimated that John du Pont was worth $200 million.\n\nDu Pont was also a philatelist. Bidding anonymously in a 1980 auction, he paid $935,000 for one of the rarest stamps in the world, the British Guiana 1856 1c black on magenta. After his death, this stamp was sold at auction for $9.5 million (inclusive of buyer's premium) at Sotheby's June 17, 2014. For the fourth time, the stamp broke the record for a single stamp's sale. The unique stamp was part of the estate of du Pont. According to du Pont's will—unsuccessfully challenged by several parties—80 percent of the sale proceeds go to the family of Bulgarian wrestler Valentin Jordanov Dimitrov and 20 percent goes to the Eurasian Pacific Wildlife Foundation, based in Paoli, Pennsylvania, a group du Pont founded to support Pacific wildlife. In 1986, competing as \"John Foxbridge\", he won the Grand Prix d'Honneur in the FIP Championship Class at the STOCKHOLMIA 86 international stamp exhibition for his display of \"British North America\". While du Pont continued to buy stamps while in prison, he was not allowed to bring them there.\n\nAfter his mother's death, du Pont developed the Liseter Hall Farm in Newtown Square as a high-quality wrestling facility for amateur wrestlers. He called the private group \"Team Foxcatcher,\" after his father's noted racing stable. Du Pont established an Olympic swimming and wrestling training center and sponsored competitive events at the estate. He also allowed some people, such as Olympic champion wrestlers Mark Schultz and later his older brother Dave Schultz and his wife, to live in houses on the grounds for years. Dave Schultz also coached the Foxcatcher team.\n\nDu Pont became a sponsor in wrestling, swimming, track, and the modern pentathlon. He was also involved in promoting a subset of the modern pentathlon (run, swim, shoot) as a separate event. He took up athletics and became a competitive wrestler in his 50s. His only prior wrestling experience was as a freshman in high school. He began competing again at the age of 55 in the 1992 Veteran's World Championships in Cali, Colombia; following that in 1993 in Toronto, Ontario; in 1994 in Rome, Italy; and in 1995 in Sofia, Bulgaria.\n\nIn August 1988, a problem-plagued wrestling program he funded at Villanova was shut down after just two years. In December 1988, a lawsuit (which was settled out of court) claimed du Pont had made improper sexual advances to Villanova assistant coach Andre Metzger.\n\nOn January 26, 1996, du Pont shot and killed Dave Schultz in the driveway of Schultz's home on du Pont's estate. Schultz's wife Nancy and du Pont's head of security Patrick Goodale were present and witnessed the crime. The security chief was sitting in the passenger seat of du Pont's car when du Pont fired three bullets into Schultz. Police did not establish a motive. Schultz had worked with du Pont to coach the wrestling team for years.\n\nDu Pont's friends said the shooting was uncharacteristic. Joy Hansen Leutner, a triathlete from Hermosa Beach, California, lived for two years on the estate. Leutner said du Pont helped her through a stressful period in the mid-1980s. She later said, \"With my family and friends, John gave me a new lease on life. He gave more than money; he gave himself emotionally.\" She expressed incredulity about the killing. She is quoted as saying: \"There's no way John in his right mind would have killed Dave.\" Newtown Township supervisor John S. Custer Jr. said, \"At the time of the murder, John didn't know what he was doing.\"\n\nMany people had noticed du Pont's increasingly disruptive behavior in the months before the murder. Charles King Sr. blames du Pont's \"security consultant\", Patrick Goodale, for influencing what happened. King said, \"I don't think John could shoot someone unless he was pushed to, or was on drugs. After that guy started hanging around him, my son always said Johnny changed. He was scared of everything. He was always a little off. But I never had problems with him, and my son never had problems.\" After the shooting, du Pont locked himself in his mansion for two days while he negotiated with police on the telephone. Police turned off his power and were able to capture him when he went outside to fix his heater. In September 1996, du Pont was ruled incompetent to stand trial, as experts testified that he was psychotic and could not participate in his own defense. He was committed to a mental hospital and his condition was to be reviewed by the court in three months.\n\nDuring the trial, one of the defense's expert psychiatric witnesses described du Pont as a paranoid schizophrenic who believed Schultz was part of an international conspiracy to kill him. He said du Pont believed people would break into his house and kill him, and that he had installed a variety of security features in his house.\n\nDu Pont pleaded \"not guilty by reason of insanity.\" The insanity defense was thrown out by the court, and on February 25, 1997, a jury found him guilty of third-degree murder but mentally ill. In Pennsylvania, third-degree murder is a lesser charge than first-degree (intentional) or second-degree (a passionate killing or a killing occurring during the perpetration of a felony), and indicates a lack of intent to kill. In Pennsylvania criminal code, \"insanity\" applies to someone whose \"disease or defect\" leaves him unable either to understand that his conduct is wrong or to conform it to the law (The M'Naghten Rule).\n\nThe jury verdict of \"guilty but mentally ill\" meant the sentencing would be referred to the judge, Patricia Jenkins. She could have sentenced du Pont to 5 to 40 years. Du Pont was sentenced to 13 to 30 years' incarceration and was housed at the State Correctional Institution – Mercer, a minimum-security institution in the Pennsylvania prison system. Du Pont was initially confined to Cresson Correctional Institute. Following the guilty verdict, Nancy Schultz, Dave's widow, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against du Pont. The amount of the settlement was not disclosed. \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", citing anonymous sources, reported du Pont was to pay Schultz at least $35 million.\n\nDu Pont's attorneys filed appeals. In 2000, his case reached the U.S. Supreme Court which upheld the verdict. Du Pont was first eligible for parole on January 29, 2009; it was denied. In 2010, the 3rd Circuit U.S. appeals court in Philadelphia rejected all but one issue raised on appeal (involving his use of prescribed scopolamine before he killed Schultz), and requested written briefs. Du Pont's maximum sentence would have ended on January 29, 2026, when he would have been 87.\n\nDu Pont died at the age of 72 on December 9, 2010, from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections said du Pont was found unresponsive in his bed at the State Correctional Institution – Laurel Highlands. He was pronounced dead at 6:55 a.m. at UPMC Somerset. He was buried in his red Foxcatcher wrestling singlet, in accordance with his will, at the Du Pont de Nemours Cemetery in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nDu Pont founded the Delaware Museum of Natural History in 1957, which opened to the public in 1972 on a site near Winterthur donated by his relative Henry Francis du Pont. John du Pont served on the board for many years. He also helped fund a new basketball arena at Villanova University, which opened in 1986. Originally it was called the John Eleuthère du Pont Pavilion, but after his conviction, his name was removed from the facility and simply called The Pavilion. Today the facility is named The Finneran Pavilion. \n\nAfter his mother's death in 1988, du Pont assumed stewardship of Liseter Farm and renamed it \"Foxcatcher Farm\" after his father's famed Thoroughbred racing stable. John never lived in the manor house; he occupied a smaller house on the estate. Days after his mother's death, he moved into the main house. He maintained much of her work, but added a wrestling facility and supporting buildings for that interest.\n\nAfter his arrest, du Pont sold off the dairy herd, nearly 70 Guernseys, in the fall of 1996. He ordered all the buildings at Foxcatcher Farm to be painted a matte black. The Delaware Museum of Natural History, which du Pont formerly headed and which held the dairy farm in trust, sold that portion in January 1998 after his conviction and sentencing to prison. A segment is now occupied by the campus of the Episcopal Academy, a private independent K–12 school founded in 1785, which moved there in 2008 from split campuses located in the nearby Philadelphia Main Line communities of Merion and Devon. The 90-year-old du Pont mansion, Liseter Hall, in which du Pont was raised and had lived for 57 years, was demolished by Glenn Miller Demolition in January 2013. The mansion stood on a portion of the property that is now being developed by Toll Brothers into a \"master planned community of 449 luxury homes\" called \"Liseter Estate.\" Most of the outbuildings were torn down, though an existing 7,000-square-foot historical barn will be used as a clubhouse in the new development.\n\nDu Pont had been worth an estimated US$200 million in 1986, about $ in current dollars. His will bequeathed 80 percent of his estate to Bulgarian wrestler Valentin Yordanov, an Olympic champion who had trained at Foxcatcher, and Yordanov's relatives. In June 2011, du Pont's niece Beverly A. du Pont Gauggel and nephew William H. du Pont filed a petition to challenge the will in Media, Pennsylvania, asserting that du Pont was not \"of sound mind\" when he made his will. The petition claims that during that period, John du Pont asserted alternately that he was Jesus Christ, the Dalai Lama, and a Russian tsar.\n\nThat petition was dismissed, and while appealed, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania has upheld a Delaware County Orphans Court order dismissing a challenge on the will on November 19, 2012. Former Delaware County Court of Common Pleas President Judge Joseph Cronin dismissed the challenge for lack of standing, finding that because the niece and nephew were not named in two successive wills going back to 2006, they would not be harmed if the September 2010 will were deemed valid. A three-judge panel of the Superior Court affirmed that ruling on November 19, 2012.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1941326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941326", "title": "Spiritual Machines", "text": "Spiritual Machines\n\nSpiritual Machines is the fourth studio album by the Canadian alternative rock band Our Lady Peace, released by Columbia Records in December 2000. Although not initially intended, the project evolved into a conceptual interpretation of futurist and inventor Raymond Kurzweil's 1999 book \"The Age of Spiritual Machines\". Short tracks of spoken dialog from Kurzweil himself are interspersed among the actual songs on the album. The Kurzweil K250 keyboard, one of his inventions, was utilized throughout the recording of the album.\n\nThe album was written and recorded in two months while the band was still on tour in support of their previous record, \"Happiness... Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch\", which had only been released 14 months prior. A combination of lead singer-songwriter Raine Maida's prolific songwriting at the time and lead-guitarist Mike Turner's discovery of \"The Age of Spiritual Machines\" in a bookstore hurried the completion of the album. The band only took a break from recording to organize and perform at Summersault in 2000. Unlike their previous releases, this one features a more organic, acoustic sound, and less obvious layering and electronic texturing.\n\n\"Spiritual Machines\" has been noted as being the end of an era for Our Lady Peace, as it was the last album produced by the band's longtime producer Arnold Lanni, the last to feature original guitarist Mike Turner in full, and the last studio album to feature art model Saul Fox on its cover. It was also the last album to feature Maida's high-falsetto singing voice prominently. The album peaked at number five in Canada, where it is certified double platinum.\n\nWhile touring rigorously in support of \"Happiness...\" in mid-2000, Mike Turner came across \"The Age of Spiritual Machines\", a 1999 book by inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil. \"I happened to be lucky enough to discover a really shiny book cover in a book store.\" Turner stated, \"I wish I could say it was like, 'Well, I've been on this intellectual quest.' I picked it up, read it and went mental.\" Becoming fascinated by the futuristic ideology of the book, he proceeded to share it with the other band members, reading them passages on their tour bus over the next several months.\n\nLead singer Raine Maida first brought up the idea of a concept album after excerpts from the book began influencing his songwriting. Passing time on the road, he had amassed a backlog of songs and had begun to record demos. He jokingly suggested an album title of \"Kurzweil\". \"That was not the most graceful sounding name in the world, so we went with Spiritual Machines instead,\" Turner said. While the other band-members were less enthusiastic about the idea due to its weighty subject matter, Maida and Turner decided to pursue it and Turner contacted Ray Kurzweil via email to ask for permission to use the title of his book for their project. Kurzweil's excitement at the prospect prompted them to invite him to record spoken excerpts from his book for the album and a correspondence developed. “I think it’s amazing that Ray Kurzweil sent us a bunch of pieces, and for whatever reason, they really tie in with what we were trying to say on this record,” said Maida.\n\nUnlike the band's three previous albums, most of the songs on \"Spiritual Machines\" were written solely by Maida. “I think that because this record happened quickly, we just ended up using a lot more of my songs this time,” stated Maida. “Whatever happens, happens, and if there are good ideas lying around, we use them.” Also unlike on their previous albums, this one was recorded sporadically piece by piece with songs being added as others were discarded. Raine had made several vocal demos at his new home recording studio before the \"Spiritual Machines\" idea had come into play. Many of these demos were used for the final recordings and Raine was given production credits. “It was more a means to an end.\" he explained, \"I would start off with a 4-track, then move to an 8-track, then go to digital. I have a ProTools system set up in my basement, so I just try to finish songs and get them out of the way so I don’t build up this backlog of ideas. We just sift through that stuff, as well as the stuff we do in rehearsal and just pick the best ideas and go. It wasn't like I said I wanted to be a producer or anything, it’s just that the demos I was making came closer to the finished product on one or two occasions, so now, I’m a producer.”\n\nJamie Edwards, who had helped record and tour for \"Happiness...\" was heavily utilized during the recording process and was becoming a big part of the band, considered by some to be the unofficial fifth member of the band at that time. Taggart recounted in 2010, \"He’s an amazing guitar player, and he played on the record. People don’t know that he had a lot to do with that stuff. He was very influential. We had him in all our writing sessions. It was a very creative time that was cool because we were all in a room, kind of working together.”\n\nBy the time the band was set to perform at Summersault in August 2000, about eight songs, including \"Life\" and \"Everyone's a Junkie\", had been recorded as demos while the band was on the road touring. Guitarist Turner noted: \"After we were done we brought them in for the record company to hear, with an eye to making plans for next year. They heard what we were doing and said, 'Well, let's finish the album you're working on.' And we thought, 'Album? We're just demoing.' But they told us what we had was great, so we went back into the studio with Arn[old Lanni] and did just that.\" Over the next two months, the band worked to complete the album with Arnold Lanni at Arnyard Studios in Toronto as well as Avatar Studios in New York City. Rumors had surfaced that, while in New York, Our Lady peace had dropped Lanni as producer to work with The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan. These rumors were later debunked by Maida. The first songs to be played live were \"Life\" and \"Everyone's a Junkie\", which debuted during Summersault in August 2000 shortly after they were first recorded. In an August 2000 interview with \"Chartattack\" Raine revealed that a song titled \"Yesterday\" (later to become \"Middle of Yesterday\") was almost guaranteed to be the first single for \"Spiritual Machines\".\nTowards the end of recording \"Spiritual Machines\", percussionist Jeremy Taggart suffered a serious ankle injury during a mugging while walking his dog. While he recovered, Taggart's friend Matt Cameron, former drummer for Soundgarden and current drummer for Pearl Jam, filled in for Taggart on the tracks \"Right Behind You (Mafia)\" and \"Are You Sad?\", which Taggart had already written the drum parts for. When the final tracks were ready for mixing, the band shopped around before finding a producer they wanted. The album was mixed in Atlanta, Georgia by Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam's long time producer. \"It was an amazing experience working with Brendan, someone who immediately understood what we were trying to do and was able to capture exactly how we heard this album,\" noted Maida.\n\nThe songs for \"Spiritual Machines\" were written and partially recorded during a year in which the band was doing extensive touring of Canada, the United States, and Europe. According to lead singer Maida, the live stage-context inspired the band to \"keep it really basic and not try to add too many textures... to not overdo it.\" and giving the technically inclined record an acoustic feel at times. According to Maida, half of the record was completed before the book and its ideas even entered the equation. During an interview in late 2001, he stated, \"... even though it seems quite intrinsic to the record, really, it only represents about four or five songs.\" While the lyrics of several songs were inspired by the futuristic theories of Kurzweil, they were also written as a response to them, saying that the human spirit would always prevail. \"Lyrically, this album is about finding the spirituality within ourselves.\" This is the case with the opening song, \"Right Behind You (Mafia)\", which Raine said, \"..[is] not an 'f-you' to Kurzweil. It's like 'I believe [much of] what you're saying, but we're going to fight it as well because there is a soul and there is a spirit.'\" Following \"Mafia\" is the song \"In Repair\", which muses on how the human body can be \"repaired,\" whether through heart surgery or after an accident. This song is countered by the following track, \"Life\" which, explained Maida, \"recognizes the pain our minds can experience.\"\n\nDuring a 2001 interview with Gary Graff from \"Wall of Sound Magazine\", Maida recounted the inspiration for the lyrics of \"Are You Sad\". He was in New York recording \"In Repair\" at the old Hit Factory studio, which was later known as Avatar Studios. Following those sessions, Maida attempted to call his younger brother from his hotel room but couldn't get through. \"When you're making a record, you kind of go into hiding, especially when I'm writing lyrics or writing music; I tend not to keep in touch with any friends or family or stuff. But my brother and I have a good relationship, and I want to keep it good. I couldn't get a hold of him for, like, a week, and I knew he was going through a shitty time — typical young-20s, no job, having a tough life. I wanted to talk to him desperately, and this song just came out of me, \"Are You Sad?\" It came out really quickly on a shitty travel guitar\". The meaning of \"If You Believe\" was revealed in a 2001 interview with Cleveland.com, \"That song's about having an out-of-body experience and seeing that the afterlife is real,\" Maida confirms, \"and telling people that there's something machines can't have, and we've got it.\n\n\"Spiritual Machines\" concludes with the track \"The Wonderful Future\", which is one of the songs on the album that features minimal instrumentation. Raine explained that the song embraces the outcome of Kurzweil's future and accepts it as something new and exciting.\nIt is about a woman who builds her \"own satellite from an old rusted chair\" who will one day realize that a man of flesh and tears can satisfy her future. \"That's one of my favourite songs, for that reason,\" said Maida. \"That song's about building the perfect human – this cyber-human – and realizing that you can't really compete.\" Following several minutes of silence after \"The Wonderful Future\", there is a hidden track with Ray Kurzweil communicating with 'Molly'. Molly is a robot from 2099, who at the beginning of the book was a 23-year-old woman who knew nothing about what Kurzweil was trying to explain, and then started to evolve in the way Kurzweil predicted.\n\nIn a March 2010 interview with \"The Montreal Gazette\", Maida looked back fondly on the making of the album and while saying it took a while to get it right both musically and lyrically, he said \"I appreciate the work I did lyrically; it does all tie together. As I sing these songs, it has that feeling of fixing things, and kind of where Ray was going in terms of being able to fix anything and possibly living beyond the realm of any human being and whatever anyone could think of a human living.\"\n\nFollowing a virtual listening party on the band's website where the full ten songs from the record were made available to listen to, \"Spiritual Machines\" was released in Canada on December 12, 2000. For those who pre-ordered the album, a limited edition version of the CD was released in a black jewel case in which the artwork was not visible, only the band's name and logo in embossed lettering. \"Spiritual Machines\" sold 36,394 copies in its debut week, and would sell a total of 100,000 units in the first month after its release, making it their fastest selling album to date. It went on to be certified 2X Platinum in Canada. As was common practice, the album was released several months later in the United States on March 13, 2001. Upon release in the United States, it spent a total of four weeks on the \"Billboard\" 200 charts, peaking at number 81. In the United States, the album has yet to be certified by the RIAA. It was released to Asian and European markets on May 9, 2001 under the Epic Records label. The record was re-released in 2008 under the Sony's Special Markets division.\n\nThe lead off single for \"Spiritual Machines\" was \"In Repair\". It was only promoted in Canada and though reaching number one on the Canadian Rock Radio charts, quickly fell off the charts shortly after its November 15, 2000 release. While the single was a failure in the United States, the music video, directed by Oli Goldsmith won multiple awards at the MuchMusic Video Awards including Best Video and Best Director. The second single was \"Life\", released shortly after the album's Canadian release in December 2000. It was the only single that was commercially released, in Australia (EPK 6718742). It fared better on the charts, reaching number 27 on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart on March 10, 2001 after 13 weeks. In Canada, the song peaked at number two on the Canadian Rock Radio charts while the music video eventually reached number one on the MuchMusic Countdown. The third and final single was \"Right Behind You (Mafia)\". By this time, \"Spiritual Machines\" was proving itself to be commercial failure in the States. The release of the single, set to be in June 2001, was aborted and the promotional copies were instead distributed to the band's fan club. The Oli Goldsmith directed music video's release was also cancelled and the video has not been seen until recently when it was released on the band's official website.\n\nThe band contacted local Toronto artist Oli Goldsmith who happened to be reading the same book, to create the artwork for the upcoming album. In total, he made around 200 paintings relating to the project, many of which were used for the album art, promotional singles and the band's website. Based on the success of that commission, the record label asked him to also create and direct music videos for the singles \"In Repair\" and \"Right Behind You (Mafia)\", which took his paintings and brought them to life with animation and stylized live motion. His artwork was described as \"Integrating photographs, logos, television images, signs, as well as a variety of written forms, such as epigrams and poetry, Goldsmith's art juxtaposes the unexpected, resulting in pieces that are bold, colourful, and energetic.\" When the album insert is unfolded, it reveals a surrealistic panorama that appears to be set in a hospital. The official photo shoot for \"Spiritual Machines\" took place on October 7, 2000 on the sixth floor of St. Joseph's Health Centre in Toronto, formerly an intensive-care unit.\n\nAlthough \"Spiritual Machines\" was not as successful as Our Lady Peace's previous three albums, it was highly praised by fans and critics alike as being one of Our Lady Peace's finest releases, and has also been proclaimed as being the height of their artistic creativity. Selena Gomez of the \"University Star\" of Texas State University–San Marcos called the album incredible, but also pointed out that it was a commercial disaster due to it being \"flighty and difficult to palate.\" MacKenzie Wilson of Allmusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars saying that \"They can still deliver pinch-hitting licks and the brash attitude they did when they first formed in 1993, but they are a little older and a little wiser.\" A review from the Hamilton Spectator noted that the album's concluding tracks \"If You Believe\" and \"The Wonderful Future\" demonstrated a particular facility for mixing sonic textures and that there were \"actually moments when vocalist Raine Maida varies from his impersonation of a singing head cold.\" Ashley Bird of Kerrang! noted that the album was packed with crisp, clean songwriting, odd searing post-grunge riffs and Raine Maida's nasal croon. He went on to say that the song \"Life\" \"is one of the most perfectly weighted slices of pop-rock you'll hear.\"\n\nEddie Fournier of \"The New Hampshire\" reviewed \"Spiritual Machines\" positively but said that \"The spoken word sections are intriguing, but in a way, they detract from the overall strength of the album, breaking up the momentum created by the powerful 10 songs.\" He concluded by saying \"Overall, \"Spiritual Machines\" is a lovely album from start to finish, and even better, it is an album that will make you wonder.\" Cheryl Hunter of the \"Hartford Courant\" said that \"It may sound formulaic, yet Maida's intelligent songwriting and nasally, but forthright vocals make Our Lady Peace more than just another faceless modern rock band.\" Bartley Kives of \"Winnipeg Free Press\" gave the album 3 stars out of 5, saying that Our Lady Peace had finally gotten control of their sound and calling it \"easily the finest thing they've ever created.\"\n\nOur Lady Peace toured in support of \"Spiritual Machines\" from November 2000 until September 2001. The first leg of the tour began with a university warm-up tour in Ontario, then a cross-Canadian fan club appreciation tour from Vancouver, British Columbia to Ste-Foy, Quebec in which members of their fan club received free tickets. The tour continued into the United States in March 2001 with American Hi-Fi joining them as an opening act. During May 2001, the band debuted a new song they had written for WWF pro-wrestler Chris Benoit that would be included on the soundtrack \"WWF Forceable Entry\" much to the chagrin of Maida. The song had been recorded in early March and was mixed in Seattle.\n\nSeveral shows during the Summer leg had to be rescheduled or canceled after Maida contracted a throat infection. A cancer scare which turned out to be harmless caused bassist Duncan Coutts to miss six weeks of touring following the shoot for the \"Life\" video in February. Rob Higgins of the band Change of Heart filled in for him while he recovered from surgery. Coutts would also miss several shows in June after breaking his wrist in a biking accident. The band wrapped up the tour with a performance at Music Without Borders at Toronto's Air Canada Centre on October 21, 2001. This would be their last live performance with Mike Turner. Several songs were recorded live by the band in Syracuse, New York with hopes of releasing a live album with producer Bob Rock and then to continue touring for the album. The live tracks were instead spread across various promos and singles and the band decided to record a full-length album, \"Gravity\", with Rock.\n\nIn December 2009, after a poll on Facebook, the band announced that they would be \"recreating\" both \"Spiritual Machines\" and their 1997 record \"Clumsy\" by performing them live in their entireties throughout a new tour that began in March 2010; nine months before the 10-year anniversary of the release of \"Spiritual Machines\". Prior to this tour, the song \"All My Friends\" had never been played live and many more songs had never been played by present guitarist Steve Mazur, having joined the band in 2002.\n\n\nStudio outtakes<br>\nSeveral known outtakes from the \"Spiritual Machines\" sessions were demos carried over from the \"Happiness...\" sessions, such as \"Ordinary Day\" and \"Sleeping In\". \"Ordinary\" is seen being played during demo sessions for \"Happiness...\" on the band's 1998 holiday fan club video. The lyrics were published in the Pied Piper's Union Christmas 1998 newsletter. A poor quality recording of the latter is available on YouTube as well as in trading circles. Other song names such as \"La Bra\" and \"A Waste of Violence\" (or The Weight of Violence) were revealed on web casts of the recording sessions or seen on original artwork by Oli Goldsmith. A narrative outtake by Ray Kurzweil titled \"R.K. Jack\" was included as an intro to the track \"Life\" on \"A Decade\".\n\nIn an August 18, 2000 article, it was revealed at that point that 8 songs were complete with four more being recorded in the past five weeks. This was before heading to New York to record \"In Repair\" and \"Are You Sad\", among others. Turner even noted \"We've got so much music, we could even put another (album) out.\"\n\nAs listed in liner notes.\n\nMusicians\nProduction\n\nDesign\n"}

Wright's sequel to his novel \"Last Guardian of Everness\", published in 2005, continuing the harrowing adventures of Raven, Wendy, Lemuel, Peter, and Galen. We learn here that to save the world from the evil tyrant Morningstar (Satan, Lucifer), they must hand it over to the \"good\" tyrant Oberon. Mists of Everness gets its title from the mists that fog people's minds, making the magic world/dream world invisible and incorporeal to mortals.\n\nThis latest installment in the Chronicles of Everness includes new mythologies: that of the oldtime radio program, \"The Shadow,\" and the three dark gods: Fate, Death, and War.\n\nAs in the previous novel, Wright blends classical, Norse, Judeo-Christian, Celtic, Hindu, Persian, and other mythologies into a riveting, though complicated, whole.\n\nLikewise, as in the first novel, Wright contrasts European/Old World mythos with the American ideals of democracy, liberty, and justice. Also, while the books contain mythologies/legendary from around the world (including reference to Hindu beliefs, medieval Muslim knights, and Asian warriors), these books are first and foremost about dreams:\n\nBasically, the world of dreams, aka \"magic, myth, and monsters,\" is a world where the old gods of Europe, Asia, and Africa live on and coexist with the ideas/dreams/stories of J.R.R. Tolkien (with references to Tirion and Vinyamar, called Vindyamar in the book), H. P. Lovecraft, and E.R. Eddison, among others. The theme of the book is that dreams, although powerful and necessary for human sanity, are dangerous if brought into the real world.\n\nWhat sets Mists of Everness apart from the first book is the depth to which the author goes in describing oneirotech: \"Dream-science.\" With a little dream-power and the aid of the Silver Key, mortals are able to make dreams into matter. The psychology of dreams and the unconscious mind also play a deeper role. For example, one character explains how certain symbols/objects have more power in the dream realm because they are deeply ingrained in the collective unconscious (called \"racial subconscious\" in the book). Swords work better than guns because a sword has mythic properties about it, connotations that reach back into the psyche of every dreaming human. In other words, swords have a deeper psychological meaning for humans than guns, horses more than cars, etc.\n\nThe author has said that he has a number of ideas for a third book (tentatively called \"Gates of Everness\"), but hasn't announced any plans to write it in the immediate future.\n"}

Established in 1965, Curecanti is responsible for developing and managing recreational facilities on three reservoirs, Blue Mesa Reservoir, Morrow Point Reservoir and Crystal Reservoir, constructed on the upper Gunnison River in the 1960s by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to better utilize the vital waters of the Colorado River and its major tributaries. A popular destination for boating and fishing, Curecanti offers visitors two marinas, traditional and group campgrounds, hiking trails, boat launches, and boat-in campsites. The state's premiere lake trout and Kokanee salmon fisheries, Curecanti is a popular destination for boating and fishing, and is also a popular area for ice-fishing in the winter months.\n\nIn 1922 seven western states, all of which contained some part of the mighty Colorado River or its major tributaries, signed an agreement to regulate the use of the vital waters of the river system. Allotments were made and each state was guaranteed a certain amount of water annually. To facilitate this effort, the member states were divided into upper and lower groups, based on geography. Recognizing their total dependence on the upper group states, whose mountain snow melts contributed the most water to the river system, the states of the lower group, California, Nevada, and Arizona, began to build dams, such as the magnificent Hoover Dam, to create storage reservoirs on their parts of the river system. By the 1950s, the upper states, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming, obligated to send a set amount of water downstream regardless of seasonal fluctuations in water levels, also began to see the wisdom of creating a system of dams and reservoirs. To grant the four states the authority to begin this process, Congress passed the Colorado River Storage Act on April 11, 1956. An important legal milestone in the tortuous history of the western water law, the Act created the Colorado River Storage Project [CRSP], and authorized four main projects, one of which was located on the Gunnison River in western Colorado, the fifth largest tributary of the Colorado River.\nThis project, originally called the Curecanti Project, was tasked with building three dams on the upper reaches of the Gunnison, approximately 27 miles west of the city of Gunnison. The resulting reservoirs, Blue Mesa, Morrow Point, and Crystal, would not only make possible water storage for transfer to the lower group states, but also for local agricultural use. Impounding this section of the river would also create new opportunities for flood control, the generation of hydro-electric power, and recreation. To help fulfill the recreation aspect of the project the National Park Service was given the responsibility to design and manage recreational opportunities on the three reservoirs. In 1965 the Park Service established Curecanti National Recreation Area, a new unit that would encompass all three reservoirs, as well as short sections of the river above and below, build campgrounds, marinas and lake access points, protect, research and interpret the natural environment and local history, and manage game and fish populations.\n\nBeginning on the river approximately 5 miles west of Gunnison, and ending on the river at the eastern border of the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, Curecanti contains four main areas:\n\nCreated by the construction of Blue Mesa Dam in 1966, Blue Mesa Reservoir is Colorado's largest body of water. Fed by the Lake Fork Arm of the Gunnison River, Soap Creek, and Cebolla Creek, the long, broad lake is long, has of shoreline, and is the largest Lake Trout and Kokanee salmon fishery in the United States. The majority of the park's visitor and recreational facilities are located around Blue Mesa and can be accessed by that section of U.S. 50 between Gunnison and Montrose, which traverses the entire length of the reservoir. Other facilities can be found on the lake's deep arms, such as Cebolla Creek and Soap Creek, which can only be reached by boat or unpaved road.\n\nLocated immediately west of Blue Mesa, Morrow Point Reservoir was created by the construction of Morrow Point Dam located 12 miles west of Blue Mesa Dam. Located in the upper reaches of the Black Canyon, the narrow, steep-sided Morrow Point offers visitors a very different environment than the expansive Blue Mesa. More remote and difficult to access than Blue Mesa, Morrow Point offers few recreational facilities but can be accessed by hand-launched boats from Pine Creek, a trailhead on U.S. 50 approximately 1 mile west of Blue Mesa Dam.\n\nMorrow Point Reservoir is the location of the Curecanti Needle, a striking and unique 700-ft tall granite spire on the reservoir's southern bank. For many years the Needle was a well-known symbol of the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad, who used the easily recognizable spire as a marketing symbol for their Black Canyon Route, which passed the Needle on the north side of the river. Now a popular destination for climbers, the Needle can only be accessed by hand-launched boat, or by crossing the frozen river in winter.\nThe most remote and least accessible of the three reservoirs, Crystal was formed by the opening of Crystal Dam in 1976. Begun in 1973, seven years after the completion of Blue Mesa Dam, Crystal, located six miles from Morrow Point Dam, was the last of the three dams of the Curecanti Project to be completed when it opened in 1976. The smallest of the three reservoirs, Crystal can be accessed from U.S. 50 at Cimarron, where a short road takes visitors to the water immediately south of Morrow Point Dam.\n\nLocated two miles below Crystal Dam at the entry to the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, East Portal is the location of the intake tunnel and diversion dam of the Gunnison Tunnel, a Bureau of Reclamation irrigation project begun in 1902 to divert river water approximately 6 miles from the Gunnison to the dry lands west of Montrose. The East Portal area includes lake access for fishing, developed picnic areas, and both drive-up and drive-in campgrounds. Though part of Curecanti, East Portal can only be accessed by the seasonal East Portal Road, a very steep twisting road located inside the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park.\n\nThere are three visitor centers located within the recreation area, all operated by the National Park Service:\n\n\nThere are also two marinas and five boat launches along the shores of Blue Mesa Reservoir:\n\n\nBoth Morrow Point and Crystal Reservoirs can be accessed by hand-launched watercraft from trailheads at Pine Creek and Cimarron, both of which can be reached via U.S. 50.\n\nCurecanti offers a number of recreational opportunities, including boating, fishing, boat-in, developed, and primitive camping, hiking, horseback riding, and hunting. Facilities on the river east of Blue Mesa include developed picnic areas at Riverway, Neversink, Cooper Ranch, and Beaver Creek, a kayak/canoe launch at Riverway and a nature trail at Neversink. All of these facilities can be reached on U.S. 50, 5 miles west of Gunnison. The area around Blue Mesa Reservoir contains 8 developed campgrounds, two of which are designated for groups. These range from the 160-site Elk Creek on the main body of the lake to smaller, more remote sites, like Ponderosa and Gateview, located on arms of the lake. Several of the campsites can accommodate RV's, but only Elk Creek offers electrical hook-ups.\nBoaters may camp overnight in 4 free camping areas with a total of 9 individual sites. Boaters may also camp on the southern shore of the Cebolla and Iola Basins, as long as campsites are not within a half-mile of any developed area, bridge, maintained public road or other boat-in/backcountry campsite.\n\nRecreational opportunities at Morrow Point Reservoir include boating (hand-carried craft only), primitive camping, and hiking. There are three small developed areas with lake access, the Pine Creek Trailhead, accessible via U.S. 50 approximately 1 mile west of Blue Mesa Dam, the Pioneer Point Overlook, north of the reservoir on Colorado Highway 92, approximately 5.5 miles west of Blue Mesa Dam, and the Hermit's Rest Trailhead, on Co. 92 approximately 17 miles west of Blue Mesa Dam. Pine Creek offers lake access for hand-carried craft and access to boat-in campsites. Pioneer Point Overlook offers a scenic viewing area and is the trailhead for the strenuous Curecanti Creek trail, a 4-mile (round trip) trail with a 900 ft. elevation change. Two campsites with picnic tables, fire grates, and composting toilets are located at the end of the trail. Hermit's Rest Trailhead gives access to the steep Hermit's Rest Trail, a 6-mile round trip with an 1800 ft. elevation change that ends with two campsites equipped with picnic tables, fire grates, and composting toilets.\n\nRecreational opportunities around Crystal Reservoir include boating (hand-carried craft only), camping, and hiking. There are two small developed areas near the reservoir, Mesa Creek Trailhead and Crystal Creek Trailhead. Mesa Creek Trailhead is located immediately west of Point Morrow Dam, and can be accessed from a one-mile road running north of U.S. 50 at Cimarron. Hand-launched watercraft can be launched into Crystal from Mesa Creek. A single boat-in campsite is located approximately 4 miles west of Mesa Creek at the mouth of Crystal Creek. Mesa Creek is also the trailhead for the Mesa Creek Trail, a fairly to moderately strenuous 1.5 mile round trip that crosses the reservoir on a footbridge and travels west along the north shore. Though Mesa Creek is a day-use facility, developed campsites are available at nearby Cimarron. Crystal Creek Trailhead is located on Colorado Highway 92, 24 miles west of Blue Mesa Dam and offers access to the 5-mile (round trip) Crystal Creek Trail. Moderately strenuous, Crystal Creek trail does reach the water but ends at an overlook 1800 ft. above the reservoir.\n\nOther recreational facilities at Curecanti include horse corrals, for equestrian campers, at Dry Gulch, Ponderosa, and Soap Creek, and the Dillon Pinnacles Trail, a moderately strenuous 4 mile round trip to the Dillon Pinnacles, a ridge of strikingly eroded volcanic rock that has become one of the most identifiable images of the park.\n\n\n\n"}

It was renamed Downing Stadium in 1955 after John J. Downing, a director at the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. It was demolished in 2002 and the current Icahn Stadium was built on the site.\n\nBuilt on Randalls Island in the East River as a WPA project, 15,000 attendees witnessed Jesse Owens compete at the stadium in the Men's Olympic Trials on July 11, 1936, the opening night of the new facility. Downing Stadium also hosted the Women's Olympic Trials in 1964. Later the stadium hosted the 1991 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships.\n\nThe stadium was also used as a filming site for a \"Sesame Street\" segment about The Flashettes girls track team. \n\nTriborough Stadium served as one of two home stadiums of the football New York Yankees of the second AFL (along with Yankee Stadium) in 1936 and 1937. The first televised American football game was held at Triborough on September 30, 1939, as Fordham took on Waynesburg. NYU's football team also played its last two seasons at Triborough in 1951 and 1952.\n\nIn 1966, the Continental Football League's Brooklyn Dodgers, unable to find a suitable field in Brooklyn (Ebbets Field had been torn down in 1960), played their home games at Downing. (Coincidentally, the football Dodgers wound up playing under the same lights used at Ebbets, as they had been moved to Randalls Island upon the older stadium's destruction.) The club would play only three games at Downing before the league took over the franchise and shifted their remaining home games elsewhere. Eight years later, Downing Stadium became the home of the New York Stars of the WFL; like the Dodgers, the Stars left the stadium before the season ended, shifting to Charlotte.\n\nRandalls Island was the site of two international soccer matches: the USA team played Scotland on Randalls Island on June 19, 1949, with the Scots winning, 4–0, with 17,000 in attendance; on May 27, 1964, the English squad crushed the Americans, 10–0, in front of just 5,062 fans.\n\nA friendly held at the stadium in July 1973 between Haiti and Millonarios of Colombia was delayed for more than two hours and forty five minutes by Haitian exiles protesting against the Duvalier regime. At one point, Haitian manager Antoine Tassy took his team to the dressing room and said that they were going home. He later made a call to Haitian Football Federation president Claude Raymond who told him to resume the match, if possible. Then, Serge Charles, a high-ranking member of the Haitian delegation to the United Nations, arrived and made another call to Raymond, and the Haitians agreed to go back on the field. Police arrived and cordoned off the field.\n\nThe New York Cosmos of the NASL moved to Downing in 1974. On June 15, 1975, Pele made his NASL debut against the Dallas Tornado, with areas of the field painted green to look better on television; CBS carried the game live. In 1976, the Cosmos moved out, back to Yankee Stadium (where they had spent their debut season in 1971); for years afterward, the words \"COSMOS SOCCER\" remained on the stadium to be seen from the nearby highway viaduct on the Triborough Bridge. Downing's last pro soccer tenant were the New York Centaurs of the A-League in 1995.\n\nThe site was considered for a 48,000-seat capacity soccer specific stadium, based on the design of the City of Manchester Stadium, had the New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics been successful. The plan was shelved when New York lost out to London.\n\nThe stadium was also used for some Negro League baseball games in the 1930s; it was the home of the New York Black Yankees in 1938.\n\nThe stadium also played host to the rugby football New Zealand All Blacks several times, in the course of larger tours to Europe. They last played a New York Metropolitan selection in October 1972, beating their hosts 41–9.\n\nIn October 1997, Downing played host to a Gaelic football match between Cavan and Kerry; the game was moved to New York in order to commemorate the 1947 All Ireland Final between the same teams played at the Polo Grounds.\n\nIn May 1990, Downing hosted an unofficial 30-overs a side cricket match between Pakistan and Australia with many regular international cricketers participating from both countries. Australia won the match by 5 runs. \n\nIn 1938, the stadium hosted the Carnival of Swing, one of the first large outdoor jazz festivals.\n\nAfter the triumph of Woodstock the previous year, the three-day New York Pop Festival tried to re-create its success in New York City, opening on Randalls Island on July 17, 1970. Unfortunately, the concert was a bust, as half the big name lineup failed to show up (although Jimi Hendrix performed a memorable set). What's more, the festival was picketed by several radical groups: some of the protesters demanded that a portion of the ticket sales go to worthy causes (even threatening the box office), while others wanted everyone to get in free. (This was partially accomplished when thousands of concert-goers literally crashed through the gates.)\n\nOnce the stadium stopped being a major sports venue, Downing was used largely for concerts, serving as a venue for rock concerts such as Lollapalooza in 1994, Pearl Jam in 1996, and the Tibetan Freedom Concert in 1997.\n\nThe stadium was torn down in 2002 in order to be replaced by a newer, smaller complex, Icahn Stadium, which was completed in 2004. This facility is used primarily for track and field.\n\n"}

They operated in the Indian Territory of the Arkansas-Oklahoma area from 1895 to 1896.\n\nFormed by Rufus Buck, the gang consisted also of Lewis Davis, Sam Sampson, Maoma July, and Lucky Davis. The gang began building up a small stockpile of weapons while staying in Okmulgee, Oklahoma. After killing U.S. deputy marshal John Garrett on July 30, 1895, the gang began holding up various stores and ranches in the Fort Smith area during the next two weeks. In one incident, a salesman named Callahan – after being robbed – was offered a chance to escape if he could outrun the gang. When the elderly Callahan successfully escaped, the gang killed his assistant in frustration. \nAt least two women victims who were raped by the gang died of their injuries.\n\n\nContinuing attacks on both local settlers and Creek indiscriminately, the gang was captured outside Muskogee by a combined force of lawmen and Indian police of the Creek Light Horse, led by Marshal S. Morton Rutherford, on August 10. While the Creek wanted to hold the gang for trial the men were brought before \"Hanging\" Judge Isaac Parker. He twice sentenced them to death, the first sentence not being carried out due to an unsuccessful appeal to the Supreme Court. They were hanged on July 1, 1896 at 1 pm at Fort Smith.\n\nA slightly modified account of the gang's crimes is the basis for the novel \"Winding Stair\" by Douglas C. Jones.\n\nThe Buck gang, \"Hanging Judge\" Isaac Parker, half-black, half-Indian outlaw Cherokee Bill, and the socio-political environment at the death of Indian Territory are the subjects of the 2011 historical novel \"I Dreamt I Was in Heaven - The Rampage of the Rufus Buck Gang\" by Leonce Gaiter.\n\n\n"}

In June 1998, he contested the FIFA presidential election against Sepp Blatter, losing by 111 votes to 80.\n\nJohansson grew up in , a then newly-built suburb west of Stockholm with his parents, his father Erik Hilmer Johansson (1884–1963) and mother Anna-Maria Johansson (née Pettersson 1886–1964). As a child, he used to bike from his home to Råsunda Stadium to watch AIK matches along with his brothers. He also played football for his local team Åkeshov.\n\nJohansson worked at Forbo Forshaga (now Forbo Flooring) from 1950 to 1990, starting as an errand-boy and in the end becoming the company's CEO and chairman. From 1984, he was a president of the board of Tipstjänst and Operakällaren; he was also chairman and president of AIK between 1967 and 1980. Johansson was a lifelong supporter of AIK.\n\nBetween 1985 and 1990, Johansson was the president of the Swedish Football Association. In 1990, he was voted UEFA President at the UEFA Congress in Malta. Johansson helped found the UEFA Champions League, replacing the European Cup.

The character was created by Judd Winick for the comic book \"Exiles\"; a psychic construct created by the Timebreakers, a race of alien bug-people who accidentally damaged a large number of alternate universes.\n\nThe Timebroker first appeared in \"Exiles\" #1, when he invited the Age of Apocalypse version of Blink to join a group of dimension-lost superheroes whom he named \"The Exiles\", whose mission would be to repair the damaged realities, and hopefully, to return home safely. A team member whose home reality is repaired is immediately sent home, and replaced with someone new.\n\nTo repair each damaged reality, the Exiles must complete a mission given to them by the Timebroker through a communications device called, \"The Tallus,\" worn by the leader of the group, be it Blink, Mimic, or Sabretooth. These missions are usually humanitarian or super-heroic in nature, but sometimes involve assassination.\n\nThe Timebroker also created a separate team of lost heroes, called Weapon X, whose job is mainly wetwork. When they grew out of control, the Timebroker ordered the Exiles and Weapon X to battle each other until only 6 remained alive.\n\nIn #53, the Exiles received a warning: \"Beware the Timebreaker. He is not what he seems.\" Almost immediately after, the Timebroker acted irrationally, giving orders to murder the Age of Apocalypse X-Men as well as the Exiles' Mimic.

Stobart, wrote two famous and influential books, The Glory that was Greece and The Grandeur that was Rome. He was also a classical scholar, a University of Cambridge lecturer, an HM Inspector of Schools and the BBC's first Director of Education.\n\nKnown as 'Jack' to his relations and friends, Stobart was born in Swyre Rectory, Dorset, England, on 5 March 1878. His father, William Stobart, was the Rector, his mother was Susan Elizabeth (née Morris), the daughter of a farmer in Rutland, and he had two elder sisters. Soon after his birth his father was appointed Rector of Bermondsey in London and the family moved to London. He was educated at Rugby School and as a Bell Scholar at Trinity College Cambridge, obtaining his BA in 1901 (MA in 1904). He also studied briefly at Greifswald University in Germany and in Edinburgh, before becoming a teacher at Merchant Taylor's School in London.\n\nIn 1904, he married Mary Currey Gibson, daughter of the Reverend Thomas Gibson, Vicar of St Sepulchre's in London. They had two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, both born in Cambridge, where in 1907 Stobart became a lecturer at Trinity College. Two years later he was appointed one of His Majesty's Inspectors of Schools and during the First World War worked for the Ministry of Munitions before acting as Assistant Secretary to the British War Cabinet of 1917–18.\n\nAfter the war, he helped organise the 1924 British Empire Exhibition at Wembley and in 1925 joined the BBC as its first Director of Education. He was responsible for two long-lasting programmes, \"Children's Hour\" and \"The Epilogue\" and according to one source suggested the BBC's motto, 'Nation Shall Speak Peace Unto Nation]'. He also proposed creating a new cultural network, to be named the \"Minerva\" programme, after the Roman goddess of wisdom, but this idea was turned down and was not realised until the creation of 'The Third Programme' at the end of the Second World War.\n\nHis mild but incisive manner, his humour and his attractive voice earned him the title of the 'BBC's charmer' and he became well-known all over the world for his regular New Year's Eve broadcast, 'The Grand Good-night'. He was already dying of diabetes when he broadcast his last Grand Good-night on 31 December 1932, from his bedroom in Kensington.\n\nMuch of the humour, charm and enthusiastic optimism mentioned in his many obituaries still comes across from the friendly, lucid style of his two most famous books, whose 'point of view', according to his Preface to \"The Grandeur that was Rome\", 'is that of humanity and the progress of civilisation'. The books were ground-breaking and successful partly because of their popular as well as scholarly approach and partly because they included what were then newly sumptuous photographic illustrations.\n\nStobart writes in his Preface: 'The pictures are an integral part of my scheme. It is not possible with Rome, as it was with Greece, to let pictures and statues take the place of wars and treaties. Wars and treaties are an essential part of the Grandeur of Rome...the pictures are chosen so that the reader's eye may be able to gather its own impression of the Roman genius.'\n\nHe disagrees with Edward Gibbon's pessimistic view of the \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\", pointing out that 'The mere notion of empire continuing to decline and fall for five centuries is ridiculous' and remarking that 'this is one of the cases which prove that History is made not so much by heroes or natural forces as by historians', since 'if all the Roman historians had perished and only the inscriptions remained we should have a very different picture of the Roman Empire, a picture much brighter and, I think, much more faithful to truth.' He admires the Romans for their law, discipline, engineering and especially their sanitation, but it is clear that he prefers the Greeks for their art, philosophy, mathematics and literature.\n\nStobart wrote and edited several other books on English and Classical literature. Two books, \"The Divine Spark\" and \"The Gospel of Happiness\" were published posthumously. He died on 11 May 1933, at his country cottage next to West Byfleet golf-course in Surrey and was buried at Old Byfleet, where his grave can still be seen. The offer of a knighthood was in the post when he died.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1941377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941377", "title": "Mohini", "text": "Mohini\n\nMohini (Sanskrit: मोहिनी, \"\") in Hindu mythology is a goddess and the only female avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu. She is portrayed as a <nowiki>\"femme fatale\"</nowiki>, an enchantress, who maddens lovers, sometimes leading them to their doom. Mohini is introduced into the Hindu mythology in the narrative epic of the \"Mahabharata\". Here, she appears as a form of Vishnu, acquires the pot of Amrita (an elixir of immortality) from the thieving asuras (demons), and gives it back to the devas (gods), helping them retain their immortality.\n\nMany different legends tell of her various exploits and marriages, including union with Shiva. These tales relate, among other things, the birth of the god Shasta and the destruction of Bhasmasura, the ash-demon. Mohini's main \"modus operandi\" is to trick or beguile those she encounters. She is worshipped throughout Indian culture, but mainly in Western India, where temples are devoted to her depicted as Mahalasa, the consort of Khandoba, a regional avatar of Shiva.\n\nThe name \"Mohini\" comes from the verb root \"moha\", meaning \"to enchant, perplex, or disillusion,\" and literally means \"delusion personified.\" In the Baiga culture of Central India, the word \"mohini\" means \"erotic magic or spell.\" The name also has an implied connotation of \"the essence of female beauty and allurement.\"\n\nThe earliest reference to a Mohini-type goddess appears in the \"Samudra manthan\" episode of the 5th century BCE Hindu epic \"Mahabharata\". The Amrita, or nectar of immortality, is produced by the churning of the Ocean of Milk. The Devas and the Asuras fight over its possession. The Asuras contrive to keep the Amrita for themselves, angering the Devas. Vishnu, wise to their plan, assumes the form of an \"enchanting damsel\". She uses her allure to trick the Asuras into giving her the Amrita, and then distributes it amongst the Devas. Rahu, an Asura, disguises himself as a god and tries to drink some Amrita himself. Surya (the sun-god) and Chandra (the moon-god) quickly inform Vishnu, and he uses the Sudarshana Chakra (the divine discus) to decapitate Rahu, leaving the head immortal. The other major Hindu epic, \"Ramayana\" (4th century BCE), narrates the Mohini story briefly in the \"Bala Kanda\" chapter. This same tale is also recounted in the \"Vishnu Purana\" four centuries later.\n\nIn the original text, Mohini is referred to as simply an enchanting, female form of Vishnu. In later versions, Mohini is described as the \"maya\" (illusion) of Vishnu. Later still, the name of the avatar becomes Mohini from the original phrase describing his deliberate false appearance (\"mayam ashito mohinim\"). Once the Mohini legend became popular, it was retold, revised, and expanded in several texts. The tales of Mohini-Vishnu also increased among devotional circles in various regions. The same expanded \"Mahabharata\" version of the story is also recounted in the \"Bhagavata Purana\" in the 10th century CE. Here, Mohini becomes a formal avatar of Vishnu.\n\nThis legend is also retold in the Padma Purana and \"Brahmanda Purana\". In the \"Brahmanda Purana\", however, Vishnu-Mohini simply, after meditation upon the Great Goddess Maheshvari, acquires her form to trick the thieving asuras.\n\nMohini also has an active history in the destruction of demons throughout Hindu texts. In the \"Vishnu Purana\", Mohini defeats Bhasmasura, the \"ash-demon\". Bhasmasura invokes the god Shiva by performing severe penances. Shiva, pleased with Bhasmasura, grants him the power to turn anyone into ashes by touching their head. The demon decides to try the power on Shiva himself. After seeing all this brahma stops the time and bhasmasur become unable to reach mahadev, on the other side while Vishnu, witnessing the unfortunate turn of events, transforms into Mohini and charms Bhasmasura. Bhasmasura is so taken by Mohini that he asks her to marry him. Mohini agrees, but only on the condition that Bhasmasura follows her move for move in a dance. In the course of the dance, she places her hand on her head. Bhasmasura mimics the action, and in turn, reduces himself to ashes. The legend of Bhasmasura is retold in the Buddhist text \"Satara Dewala Devi Puvata\", with a slight variation. In this tale, Vishnu assumes his female form (the name \"Mohini\" is not used) and charms Bhasmasura. The female Vishnu asks Bhasmasura to promise never to leave her by placing his hand on his head as per the usual practice to swear on one's head. On doing so, Bhasmasura is reduced to ashes.\n\nIn a similar legend related to the birth of Ayyappa, the demon Surpanaka earns the power to turn anyone into ashes by his austerities. The tale mirrors all other aspects of the Buddhist version of the Bhasmasura tale, where he is forced by Mohini to severe fidelity by keeping his hand on his head and is burnt.\n\nThe prelude of the \"Ramakien\", the Thai version of the \"Ramayana\", the demon Nontok is charmed and killed by Mohini-Vishnu. Nontok misuses a divine weapon given to him by Shiva. The four-armed Mohini-Vishnu enchants Nontok and then attacks him. In his last moments, the demon accuses Vishnu of foul play saying that Vishnu first seduced him and then attacked him. Vishnu decrees that in his next birth, Nontok will be born as the ten-headed demon Ravana and Vishnu will be a mortal man called Rama. He will then fight him and defeat him.\n\nIn a lesser-known tale in the \"Ganesha Purana\" (900–1400 CE) the wise asura king Virochana is rewarded a magical crown by the sun-god Surya. The crown shields him against all harm. Vishnu as Mohini then enchants Virochana and steals his crown. The demon, thus unprotected, is killed by Vishnu.\n\nAnother South Indian legend about the demon Araka associates Mohini with Krishna (an avatar of Vishnu) rather than the god himself. The demon Araka had become virtually invincible because he had never laid eyes on a woman (extreme chastity). Krishna takes the form of the beautiful Mohini and marries him. After three days of marriage, Araka's bonds of chastity are broken, and Krishna kills him in battle. Transgender Hijras consider Krishna-Mohini to be a transsexual deity.\n\nStories about Mohini and Shiva have been popular in South Indian texts. In the southern version of the \"Bhagavata Purana\", after Vishnu deceives the demons by his maya female form, Shiva sees Mohini. He becomes \"bereft of shame and robbed by her of good sense,\" runs crazily behind enchanting form, while his wife Parvati (Uma) looks on. Shiva is overcome by Kāma (love and desire) in this version of mythology. Shiva's unfailing energy falls from his eye on the ground creating ores of silver and gold. Vishnu then states that emotions are difficult to overcome, and states that Maya will become a half of Shiva's Ardhanarisvara aspect. Shiva then extols Vishnu's power.\nThe \"Tripurarahasya\", a south Indian Shakta text, retells the story, giving more importance to the Goddess. When Shiva wishes to see Vishnu's Mohini form again, Vishnu fears that he may be burned to ashes like Kamadeva by the supreme ascetic Shiva. So, Vishnu prays to goddess Tripura, who grants half of her beauty to Vishnu, begetting the Mohini-form. As Shiva touches Mohini, his energy spills from his eyes, indicating a loss of the merit gained through of all his austerities.\n\nIn the \"Brahmanda Purana\" when the wandering sage Narada tells Shiva about Vishnu's Mohini form that deluded the demons, Shiva dismisses him. Shiva and his wife Parvati go to Vishnu's home. Shiva asks him to take on the Mohini form again so he can see the actual transformation for himself. Vishnu smiles, again meditates on the Goddess of Shri Lalita Mahatripurasundari and transforms himself into Mohini. Overcome by desire, Shiva embraces Mohini to discharge his seed from his eyes which falls on the ground leading to the birth the god Maha-Shasta (\"The Great Teacher\"). Mohini disappears, while Shiva returns home with Parvati. While the narrative of events vary widely, the events are generally interpreted as \"leela\" between the Gods leading to the creation of Shasta, who was to be born of Shiva and Vishnu to defeat the evil Mahishasuri.\n\nShasta is identified primarily with two regional deities: Ayyappa from Kerala and the Tamil Aiyanar. He is also identified with the classical Hindu gods Skanda and Hanuman. One of the variants of the story says that instead of a biological origin, Ayyappa sprang from Shiva's energy, which is discharged upon embracing Mohini. Ayyappa is referred to as \"Hariharaputra\", \"the son of Vishnu (Hari) and Shiva (Hara)\", and grows up to be a great hero.\n\nThe Tamil text \"Kanda Puranam\" narrates about the birth of Shasta identified with Aiyanar. The text tells just before the tale that Vishnu is Shiva's \"Shakti\" (wife and power) Parvati in a male form. The legend begins with Shiva's request and Vishnu's agreement to show his illusionary Mohini form, that he assumed for the distribution of amrita. Shiva falls in love with Mohini and proposes a union with her. Mohini-Vishnu declines saying that union of two same gender women was unfruitful. Shiva informs Mohini-Vishnu that he was just one of forms of his Shakti. Thereafter, their union resulted in the birth of a dark boy with red locks, who was named Hariharaputra. Further, he was also known as Shasta and Aiyannar.\n\nIn the \"Agni Purana\", as the enchanted Shiva follows Mohini, drops of his energy from his eyes falls on the ground and become \"lingas\", Shiva's symbols. His energy also generates the monkey-god Hanuman, who helps Vishnu's avatar Rama in his fight against Ravana in the Ramayana. Shiva Purana says that by the mere glimpse of Mohini, Shiva spurts out his seed. The seed was collected and poured into the ear of Añjanā, who gave birth to Hanuman, the incarnation of Shiva. The latter is retold in the Thai and Malaysian version of the Ramayana. Though Hanuman strings from Shiva's seed, he is also considered as a combined son of Vishnu and Shiva.\n\nThe Buddhist version of the Bhasmasura tale continues with Shiva (Ishvara) asking the female-Vishnu, who is seated on a swing, to marry him. She asks Shiva to get the permission of his wife Umayangana to take her home. Shiva returns with Umayangana's consent to find the female-Vishnu pregnant, who sends him back to get permission to bring a pregnant woman home. When he returns, a child is born and female-Vishnu is pregnant again. She requests Shiva to seek approval to bring a pregnant woman with a child home. This happens six more times. Finally, Shiva brings Umayangana with him to witness the miraculous woman. Vishnu then returns to his male form. Umayangana embraces the six youngest children merging them into the six-headed Skanda, while the eldest, named Aiyanayaka (\"eldest brother\") remains intact. Aiyanayaka is identified with Aiyanar.\n\nMohini plays a lesser role in a Shaiva legend in the \"Skanda Purana\". Here, Vishnu as Mohini joins Shiva to teach a lesson to arrogant sages. A group of sages are performing rituals in a forest, and start to consider themselves as gods. To humble them, Shiva takes the form of an attractive young beggar (Bhikshatana) and Vishnu becomes Mohini, his wife. While the sages fall for Mohini, their women wildly chase Shiva. When they regain their senses, they perform a black magic sacrifice, which produces a serpent, a lion, an elephant (or tiger) and a dwarf, all of which are overpowered by Shiva. Shiva then dances on the dwarf and takes the form of Nataraja, the cosmic dancer. The legend is retold in the Tamil \"Kovil Puranam\" and \"Kandha Puranam\" with some variation. This legend is also told in the \"Sthala Purana\" related to the Chidambaram Temple dedicated to Shiva-Nataraja.\n\nAnother legend from the \"Linga Purana\" says that the embracing of love-struck Shiva and Mohini led to be their merging into one body. At this moment, Mohini became Vishnu again, resulting the composite deity Harihara, whose right side of the body is Shiva and left side is Vishnu in his male form. In the temple in Sankarnayinarkovil near Kalugumalai is one of the rarest exceptions to iconography of Harihara (Sankara-Narayana). The deity is depicted similar to the Ardhanari, the composite form of Shiva-Parvati, where right side of the body is the male Shiva and left side is female. This image's female side represents Mohini and it, as a whole, symbolizes the union of Shiva and Mohini. The influence of Shakta traditions on Shaiva ones may have led to the development of composite images like Harihara, where Vishnu is identified with Mohini.\n\nIn the \"Brahma Vaivarta Purana\", Mohini tries to seduce the creator-god Brahma. But brahma restrains himself and avoids falling for her.\n\nAnother South Indian folktale tells of the \"Mahabharata\" hero Aravan (who becomes the Tamil god Kuttantavar), who was married to Mohini, before his self-sacrifice. Aravan agrees to become the sacrificial victim for the \"Kalappali\" (\"sacrifice to the battlefield\") to ensure the victory of the Pandavas, his father, and his uncles. Before being sacrificed to goddess Kali, Aravan asks three boons from Krishna, the guide of the Pandavas. The third boon was that Aravan should be married before the sacrifice so that he could get the right of cremation and funerary offerings (bachelors were buried). This third boon, however, is found only in the folk cults. To fulfill this wish in the Kuttantavar cult myth, Krishna turns into Mohini, marries Aravan, and spends the night with him. Then after the sacrifice, Mohini laments Aravan's death, breaking her bangles, beating her breasts, and discarding her bridal finery. She then returns to the original form of Krishna. The legend of the marriage of Aravan and Krishna in his female form as Mohini, and Mohini-Krishna's widowhood after Aravan's sacrifice, forms the central theme of an eighteen-day annual festival in the Tamil month of Cittirai (April–May) at Koovagam. The marriage ceremony is re-enacted by transgender Hijras, who play the role of Mohini-Krishna.\n\nAccording to mythologist Pattanaik, Mohini is just a disguise to delude the demon Bhasmasura, rather than a sexual transformation in this legend. Mohini is a disillusion, Vishnu's \"maya\".\n\nStories in which Shiva knows of Mohini's true nature have been interpreted to \"suggest the fluidity of gender in sexual attraction\". Pattanaik writes while Westerners may interpret the Shiva-Mohini union as homosexual, traditional Hindus do not agree to this interpretation. He also writes that those focusing only on homoeroticism miss the narrative's deeper metaphysical significance: Mohini's femininity represents the material aspect of reality, and Mohini's seduction is another attempt to induce the ascetic Shiva into taking an interest in worldly matters. Only Vishnu has the power to \"enchant\" Shiva; a demon who tried to enchant and hurt Shiva in form of a woman was killed in the attempt.\n\nAnother interpretation posits that the Mohini tale suggests that Vishnu's \"maya\" blinds even supernatural beings. Mohini is \"the impersonation of the magically delusive nature of existence which fetters all beings to the rounds of births and deaths and vicissitudes of life.\" Mohini also does not have an independent existence; she exists only as a temporary delusion, and is absorbed back into Vishnu after serving her purpose.\n\nThe legend of the union of Mohini-Vishnu and Shiva may also be written as part of the desire to have a common child of the two cosmic patriarchs of Hinduism.\n\nOn the fifth day of Brahmotsavam, Venkateshwara is dressed as Mohini and paraded in a grand procession.\n\nIn Goa, Mohini is worshipped as Mahalasa or Mahalasa Narayani. She is the Kuladevi (family goddess) of many Hindus from western and southern India, including Goud Saraswat Brahmins, Karhade Brahmins, Daivajnas and Bhandaris. The chief temple of Mahalasa Narayani is at Mardol, Goa, though her temples also exist in the states of Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. Mahalasa has four hands, carrying a Trishula, a sword, a severed head, and a drinking bowl. She stands on a prostrate man or demon, as a tiger or lion licks blood dripping from the severed head. Goud Saraswat Brahmins as well as Vaishnavas from Goa and South Canara identify her with Mohini and call her Narayani and Rahu-matthani, the slayer of Rahu, as told in the \"Bhavishya Purana\".\n\nMahalasa is also called Mhalsa, the consort of Khandoba, a local incarnation of Shiva. As the consort of Khandoba, her chief temple - the Mohiniraj temple - is located at Nevasa, where she is worshiped as a four-armed goddess and identified with Mohini. Mhalsa is often depicted with two arms and accompanying Khandoba on his horse or standing besides him.\n\nThe central icon of the Jaganmohini-Kesava Swany temple at Ryali, discovered buried underground by the king in the 11th century, represents the male Vishnu in the front, while the back of the icon is the female Jagan-Mohini (\"one who deludes the world\") or Mohini, with a female hairdo and figure. A \"Sthala Purana\" tells that the flower in Mohini's hair fell at Ryali (\"fall\" in Telugu) when Mohini was being chased by Shiva.\n\nMohini has an important, dramatic role in several mythical works of South Indian drama like \"Yakshagana and Kathakali\". In Kerala, however, where Mohini's son Ayyappa is popular, the \"Mohiniattam\" (\"the dance of Mohini\") is honored as an independent dance form. Named after the goddess, it is a dance meant exclusively for women and \"an ideal example of the erotic form.\" The origins of Mohiniattam form are unknown, though it was popularized in the 1850s, but later banned as it was used by \"loose women\" to attract customers. The ban was lifted in 1950, after which it has seen a renewal.\n\nThe legends of Mohini are also being depicted in other dances, including the modern \"Kathak\". The \"Sonal Nati\", performed in the Saho area of Chamba district, Himachal Pradesh, retells the Mohini-Bhasmasura tale, and hence is known as the Mohini-Bhasmasura dance. It is performed on festive occasions, especially in the Saho fair held in Baisakh in the precincts of the Chandershekhar temple.\n\n"}
{"id": "1941388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941388", "title": "Adalia bipunctata", "text": "Adalia bipunctata\n\nAdalia bipunctata, commonly known as the two-spot ladybird, two-spotted ladybug or two-spotted lady beetle, is a carnivorous beetle of the family Coccinellidae that is found throughout the holarctic region. It is very common in western and central Europe. It is also native to North America but it has heavily declined in many states and provinces. It is commonly introduced and imported as a biological control agent.\n\nThe two-spotted ladybird was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in his 18th-century work \"Systema Naturae\"; its original name was \"Coccinella bipunctata\". Its specific name is from the Latin \"bi-\" \"two\", and \"punctata\" \"spotted\". The name can also be written as \"Adalia 2-punctata\" depending on author preference.\n\n\"Adalia bipunctata\" is a small Coccinellid that can feature any one of a large selection of red and black forms. Some forms are similar to Mulsantina picta, but the two white spots on the head of \"Adalia\" (in contrast with a large white region or more than two spots, readily separates it. Additionally \"Adalia\" is entirely black on the ventral surface with black legs, which helps rule out any other options.\n\nThe two-spotted ladybird is highly variable in many parts of its native range. The most familiar form, form \"typica\" with two black spots on a red base, is common throughout. A melanistic form that is black with 4 or 6 red spots is uncommon, but not rare, while the truly melanistic form \"purpurea\" is exceedingly rare. In North America the species shows the most variation, with several forms that do not occur elsewhere including a spotless form, a four-banded form, a 9-12 spotted form, and a \"cross-hatched\" form. In addition, there are intermediate forms such as form \"annulata\", but they occur rarely.\n\nTwo-spotted lady beetles feed on aphids and other small insects. However, the sterile soldiers within colonies of aphids such as the gall-forming Pemphigus spyrothecae, can attempt to protect the aphid colony by fighting this species.\n\nThe two-spotted lady beetle's life cycle starts with eggs that are usually laid in clutches. The larva hatches from the egg by biting a hole in it. The larva looks very different from an adult: it has an elongated, grey, soft body with six legs but no wings. They are cannibalistic. A larva goes through four larval stages: by eating it grows and at some point it sheds its old skin and appears in a new one in which it can grow more. The last larval stage is approximately the size of an adult beetle. Once it has eaten enough, the larva attaches itself to a substrate and moults into a pupa. Inside the pupa, the adult develops. Finally the adult ecloses from the pupa.\n\nIn some populations, the majority of the beetles are female. In these populations, 80-90% of the offspring of a female are female. The cause of this anomaly is the presence of symbiotic bacteria living within the gametic cells of the female lady beetles. The bacterium is too large to live in the male gametes (sperm), so the bacterium can be transmitted to the next generation only through female gametes. When it ends up in a male, it will die when the male dies. Therefore, it kills most of the male embryos in the newly laid eggs. These dead embryos then serve as food for their sisters when they emerge from their eggs. This trait is associated with a variety of different bacteria (\"Wolbachia\", \"Rickettsia\", \"Spiroplasma\"), which are present in between 0 and 20% of females, depending on locality.\n\nThe two spot ladybird also carries a sexually transmitted infection in Central and Eastern Europe. The infection is an ectoparasitic mite Coccipolipus hippodamiae that transfers between male and female (and female and male) during copulation. The infection sterilizes female two spot ladybirds, and at some points of the year, up to 90% of adult 2-spots become infected.\n\n\"A. bipunctata\" is used as a localised biological control agent against aphids in, for example, greenhouses.. The Two-spotted lady beetle was introduced into Australia specifically as a biological control agent.\n"}
{"id": "1941389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941389", "title": "Puget Sound salmon recovery", "text": "Puget Sound salmon recovery\n\nPuget Sound salmon recovery is a collective effort of federal, state and local authorities and non-profit coalitions of universities, scientists, business and industry aimed at restoring Pacific salmon and anadromous forms of Pacific trout (\"Oncorhynchus\") within the Puget Sound region. The Puget Sound lies within the native range of the Pacific Salmon (\"Oncorhynchus\") and two sea-run forms of Pacific trout, the coastal rainbow trout (\"O. mykiss irideus\") or steelhead and coastal cutthroat trout (\"O. clarki clarki\"). Populations of \"Oncorhynchus\" have seen significant declines since the middle of the 19th century due to over fishing, habitat loss, pollution and disease. Salmon species residing in or migrating through the Puget Sound to spawning streams include Chum (\"O. keta\"), Coho (\"O. kisutch\"), Chinook (\"O. tshawytscha\"), Sockeye (\"O. nerka\"), and Pink salmon (\"O. gorbuscha\"). Pacific salmon require freshwater rivers for spawning and most major tributaries of the Puget Sound have salmon, steelhead and cutthroat trout spawning runs.\n\nMajor organizations involved in recovery efforts include the Puget Sound Partnership, Shared Strategy for Puget Sound, South Puget Sound Salmon Enhancement Group and Westsound Watersheds Council\n\nPacific salmon rely on near-shore waters and estuaries for survival during a part of their life cycle. Salmon use estuaries and near-shore areas for migration, juvenile rearing, refuge, and feeding. Large trees in rivers are no longer common. The Nisqually River was in pristine condition when it was layered with log jams. It turns out, logjams actually help salmon, partly by slowing the speed of the river and by creating cool pools and channels that are good places for adult and juvenile fish to hide, feed and spawn. When 90% of wetlands were lost, 90% of salmon was also lost.\n\nA Migratory Path\n\nPuget Sound's near-shore region is composed of shallow saltwater, nearby wetlands, estuaries, beaches, and bluffs. These areas are critical zones for juvenile salmon as they make the transition from rivers to the ocean. Salmon are known to move through estuaries twice in their lifetimes. The first move is as juveniles when they move to the sea, and the second is as adults when they transition back to the rivers in order to spawn.\n\nA Place To Adjust\n\nJuvenile salmon spend a prolonged period of time (weeks to months) in estuaries in order to help ease their bodies adapt to the transition from fresh water to salt water. In a process called “Smoltification”, salmon are able to make the next step in preparing their bodies for the transition from freshwater to saltwater. Specifically, their bodies go through dramatic changes portrayed through their outward appearance, behavior, and even body chemistry. When these salmon return as adults they must go through the same process again in estuaries to help make the transition from saltwater to freshwater before heading back to their respective rivers to spawn.\nThere are many different species of salmon that run through the Puget Sound. Such salmon species include Chum, Coho, Chinook, Sockeye, Pink, and Steelhead. These salmon swim through the Puget Sound to spawn in the rivers running into the Puget Sound. Some Puget Sound rivers that salmon swim up are: Nooksack, Samish, Skagit, Baker, Cascade, Stillaguamish, Snohomish, Skykomish, Green, Puyallup, Carbon, Nisqually, Deschutes rivers. Salmon also go up Lake Washington, Lake Sammamish, Kennedy Creek, and Minter Creek.\n\nThe life cycle of salmon requires specific conditions within the chain of connected environments. Salmon typically live 3–6 years, which often changes depending on life conditions. While some salmon stay within the Puget Sound, others will migrate and live deeper in the Pacific Ocean. The salmon begin their journey as fertilized eggs in a stream that eventually hatch and move downstream in freshwater (lasting anywhere from months to three years depending on species). Once they mature to juvenile salmon also known as, “fry” they migrate from the freshwater stream towards an Estuary where “saltwater meets freshwater”. Here, they begin to adapt to the salt water during a process known as smoltification, which can last up to a few months. At this point, they are ready to transition through the coastal shores into the North Pacific Ocean where they stay anywhere from six months up to five years and travel as far as the Gulf of Alaska. Depending on the species, the salmon are ready to return to their home stream, river, or lake after one to seven years of being in the ocean to begin the process of spawning. Once the salmons spawn, the process beings again with the new salmon.\n\nJuvenile salmon: The Most Crucial Stage of the Life Cycle\n\nAs mentioned above, juvenile salmon utilize estuaries to transition from freshwater to saltwater environments. These estuaries contain the necessary amount of both fresh and salt water so the salmon can steadily adapt without causing harm to their body chemistry, in the process called \"smoltification\". Yet while this meeting of fresh and salt is necessary, juvenile salmon use estuaries for more than a place of adaption. Eelgrass and further vegetation tend to grow in or around these shoreline areas, offering protection for juvenile salmon from predators such as larger, grown salmon. Furthermore, \"juvenile salmon experience the highest growth rates of their lives while in estuaries and nearshore waters\". Since nutrients are so crucial to their growth, the complex food web produced from these water plants such as eelgrass serves the juvenile salmon well, and these salmon tend to be more selective, using instincts to tell them what will better prepare their bodies for ocean residence or migration later in their lives.\n\nAlthough salmon spend only a part of their life cycle in near-shore areas, these habitats are critical to the survival of salmon populations. Shoreline habitats of Puget Sound have suffered significant losses over the last 125 years. When marshes are lost, young salmon lose food and shelter. Studies show a 73 percent decline in salt marsh habitats bordering Puget Sound. Nearly all salt marsh habitats within major urban areas along Puget Sound have been destroyed. The Puyallup River Delta, for example, lost 100 percent of its nearshore habitat. Other factors that contribute to habitat loss are pollutants, bulkheads, loss of shoreline vegetation and the blockage from docks and piers. Polluted estuaries and nearshore areas have caused juvenile salmon to suffer adverse effects as they pass through the estuaries. Human-caused stresses can cause immune dysfunction, increased susceptibility to disease, and impaired growth. Bulkheads can disrupt shore drift and shoreline vegetation, thus eliminating cover and food sources for young salmon. Loss of shoreline vegetation along the shore is of particular importance to juvenile salmon because it stabilizes the shoreline, provides shade, acts as a protective cover, organic input and food source for young salmon moving in close to shore. Docks and piers can block light to underwater habitats such as eelgrass meadows, and sources of food and shelter for juvenile salmon and other marine life.\n\nIn conclusion, of all of the threats that salmon are faced with, including climate change, disease and animal predation, habitat loss is one of the greatest threats. Salmon face many obstacles throughout their cycle that add on the four mentioned before: loss of access to historic habitat, habitat destruction, pesticide use, aquaculture, urban development and encroachment onto riparian areas and increasing water temperatures in streams. It is critical to have open passages to natal or home streams for adults to spawn. If their energy is depleted before they spawn, they die without producing the net generation of fish. Warming water temperature and low water levels in streams also accelerate pre-spawn mortality.\n\n“Salmon are a national treasure\".\nand local Pacific Northwest Icon, yet human development is destroying their habitats while their wild populations decline. Humans have witnessed three unsuccessful experiments with salmon and their efforts to adapt to a shifting environment, impacted by humans, in England, New England, and today in the Puget Sound. Before settlement there were an estimated 10-16 million salmon in the Columbia Basin/ Puget Sound area. 29% of these populations are now extinct, and 27 species are threatened or endangered. Fishing and hatcheries has reduced salmon biocomplexity. Puget Sound action Team and Puget Sound Partnership are working to get immediate actions to save and protect Puget Sound Salmon. “If history has a lesson here, it is that technological fixes and politically motivated half measures will at best delay the inevitable.” \n\nPuget Sound used to home a much more diverse and robust population of Chinook Salmon. Current levels of Chinook are around 10% of historic numbers. Some of the salmon populations are at less than 1% of their historic numbers. 15 of the 37 Chinook populations have disappeared and their steep decline is strongly correlated with the deterioration of Puget Sound as a whole. \n\nIn 1999, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) listed the Chinook salmon, summer chum and bull trout in the Puget Sound. As a result, the National Oceans and Atmosphere Administration (NOAA) working in collaboration with Shared Strategies, and the Puget Sound Technical Recovery team to combine recovery efforts to produce a single plan of the region. This was the beginning of the Puget Sound Salmon Recovery Project.\n\nIn 2005, Shared Strategies presented a regional plan for the recovery of ESA listed Chinook salmon in the Puget Sound. After two years of clarifying, finalizing and expanding the proposal making sure it complied with all ESA requirements, NOAA finally adopted the final Puget Sound Salmon Recovery Plan. However, the cost of this recovery plan is enormous, according to the Washington State Recreation and Conservation Office this recovery plan has an estimated cost of 1.42 billion dollars for the first ten years.\n\nWhat the Puget Sound Partnership is Doing to Recover Salmon\n\nThe Puget Sound Partnership was designated to serve as the regional recovery organization on January 1, 2008. The rigorous recovery plan was built through a multi-year stakeholder process. The partnership is working with various communities, tribes, businesses, and state and federal agencies to implement programs that will hopefully help recover salmon. These programs include protecting and restoring habitat, raising public awareness, reforming hatchery management, assuring integration of harvest practices, and developing a monitoring and adaptive management strategy to help track and assess efforts to recover salmon in the Puget Sound. To ensure the recovery goes well, salmon recovery and Sound recovery must go hand in hand. The Partnership is working with watersheds to implement lasting solutions to the challenges facing the Puget Sound and Salmon.\n\nPaving large expanses of land increases runoff of pollutants into streams and rivers that eventually wash into Puget Sound. This impact is evident in the fact that salmon have large quantities of PCBs in their bodies. In 2007 the Department of Health issued a consumption advisory warning against eating Puget Sound salmon.\n\nSince 1991, there has been a marked increase in the amount of impervious surfaces in the Greater Puget Sound area. Impervious surfaces are man-made structures such as roads, house foundations and roofs that prevent water from being absorbed and filtered through the soil. Stormwater management systems have reached their capacity to catch and treat this runoff water. Sudden increases in stream flow that occur during high rainfall can be greatly exacerbated by urbanization that replaces natural vegetation with pavement or rooftops.\n\nThe Department of Ecology found that surface runoff is the largest source of toxic chemicals being deposited into Puget Sound. Streams drain directly into Puget Sound from roads, driveways and rooftops, without benefit of filtration.\n\nIt is possible to reduce pollution of streams and rivers by using Low Impact Development (LID) methods in construction projects. These low-impact development methods are environmentally friendly by reducing the amount of storm water runoff that reaches Puget Sound. These building methods not only help Puget Sound salmon, but also benefit humans through increasing property values, and enhancing aesthetic appeal.\n\nRain gardens\n\nSalmon friendly gardens, also called rain gardens, would prevent overflow and surges and would absorb pollutants which would otherwise be washed directly into freshwater systems. When a storm causes rainwater to surge into rivers and streams via storm drains, the heavy flow of fast moving water commonly erodes the soil thus destroying precious salmon and steelhead habitat. Said storm drain surges are typically warmer in temperature than the water of the streams into which they are being deposited. This causes river and stream temperatures to rise and places further stress on growing and migrating salmon and steelhead. The salmon friendly gardens are planted as depressions in the ground, and work by absorbing much of the rainwater runoff which is redirected to first flow through the gardens before ultimately ending up in the rivers and streams. The gardens therefore slow and lessen the storm surges and filter out pollutants being washed out of the city. Planting rain gardens would result in less erosion, lower and stable water temperatures, and less pollutants entering freshwater systems.\n\nUrbanization\n\nUrbanization of the Puget Sound lowlands has had a primarily negative impact on the salmon species that spawn in the surrounding streams and rivers. One of the most noticeable changes in these urbanized areas is the increase in the traditional 10-year flood being reduced to occurring once every 1–4 years. As a result of this increase in flood waters the areas where salmon lay their eggs are being washed away; this is because salmon lay their eggs just far enough beneath the bedrock to accommodate for the traditional annual flood, but due to urbanization the annual flood waters have increased and the layer of bedrock where salmon lay their eggs is washed away. This leaves the salmon with less habitat to successfully spawn on as a result. As stated above the one way to fix this problem is to use LID methods to help with the filtration process which at the same time reduces the quantity of water being put into the streams and rivers.\n\nIn a letter to Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, Washington State's Trollers Association board member Jeremy Brown noted that salmon \"aren't just a part of our state's natural heritage, they are also very important to our economy.\" The letter was composed by 120 business and community leaders who expressed a range of concerns. But, other business owners tend to agree that salmon are a crucial to the state's economy, and that recovery efforts do not go far enough to protect them.\n\nIn the Pacific Northwest, fishing accounts for 36,000 full-time jobs including catching, canning, and selling. However, one must also consider the jobs created by Puget Sound Salmon not directly related to the fish. The sale of boats, boating equipment, and other fishing necessities are impacted greatly by the continued supply of salmon. Fishermen warn that if the salmon supply continues to dry up, so will their jobs, and the jobs of many who depend on them.\n\nThere are groups that are trying to make the relationship between people, salmon, and the economy more sustainable. In 1999, The Center for Watershed and Community Health (CWCH) created the Salmon Economics Project in order to assist decision makers in understanding economic issues regarding salmon. The Project claims that salmon issues are widespread and have deep roots, and that habitats must be restored across large landscapes. They provide possible solutions for the problem, such as resource pricing for fish, stable trade, and well-trained workers.\n\nThere is also a strong argument that dams are detrimental to the economy because of their effect on salmon. According to Idaho Rivers United, recent studies show that dam removal will save U.S. taxpayers and Northwest electricity consumers billions of dollars and generate billions more in increased tourism, outdoor recreation and improved sport and commercial fishing opportunities.\n\nSalmon are cultural icons in the Pacific Northwest. Specifically, Puget Sound is home to thousands of invertebrate species, 200 species of fish, 100 species of sea birds, and 26 kinds of marine mammals. Of all these species, salmon and killer whales are the most iconic and culturally relevant to the Native American tribes within the Pacific Northwest region. Salmon are born in streams than head to the sea as juveniles. After spending a few years in the ocean, they return to their birth streams in order to spawn (reproduce). Historically, Puget Sound was one of the most salmon-filled regions evident from the bountiful salmon-bearing streams that essentially had an unlimited supply of salmon. Consequently, due to the expansion of urban development salmon populations are dwindling due to the deterioration of salmon and their crucial habitats. Holistically, the sharp decline in salmon can also be attributed to the decline of killer whales in the region. These killer whales rely heavily on healthy population of salmon and other fish in the region but are left starving to death because of the declining fish population caused from human pollution and urban development.\n\nHistorically, the connection between salmon and the native tribes in Puget Sound run deep within the Puget Sound Community. The Pacific Northwest region provides an exceptionally rich and nurturing environment for salmon. Salmon play a critical role in the survival of the local economy and culture for the indigenous people that make up the Pacific Northwest. Over the last 1500 years, an equilibrium has been forged between the delicate balance of salmon and human ecosystems. Historically, harvest rate and fish losses were only attributed to natural phenomena and indigenous fishing practices. Consequently, a new phenomenon has wreaked havoc and ruined the delicate balance between salmon and humans. In the 19th century, the sudden arrival of early pioneers and entrepreneurs to the region caused havoc through the monumental changes in the amount of fishing taking place and the vast technological advances of fishing equipment to catch unprecedented salmon numbers. The addition of a new market-driven industrial economy has also provided new vulnerabilities for the Pacific Northwest's salmon runs, causing environmentalists to think up new and creative ways to save the Puget Sound Salmon. The connection between salmon and the Native American tribes within the Pacific Northwest portray a deep relationship forged through many generations. Human society is a direct threat to this cultural icon, and people must work on a holistic level to join forces within the legislature to save these cultural icons for many generations to come. \n"}

Then, in a 2002 book \"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony\" Pamela Paul analyzed historical trends in American matrimony, pointing out that, as of 2002, Americans were getting married only slightly older than 100 years before, but that they were living decades longer. (In fact, Americans of Generation X are getting married at a rate closer to that of their grandparents than of their Baby Boomer parents.) She also claimed that some young couples get married for reasons not strong enough to support a long relationship, and that an increasing number of them end their marriages quickly. Paul's book caused controversy for suggesting that these divorces are a good thing, if the couple have not had children. The book came out at the same time as some highly public celebrity breakups, including those of Tom Green and Drew Barrymore, Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lopez, Nicolas Cage and Lisa Marie Presley, and socialite Nina Griscom. \n\nThe term, a play on the expression \"starter home\", appears as one of the footnotes in Douglas Coupland's 1991 novel \"\". Published usage of the term grew significantly after \"'Starter Marriages': So Early, So Brief,\" a New York Times article by Deborah Schupack, as well as the subsequent publication of Pamela Paul's 2002 book \"The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony\".\n\nIn 2005, Kate Harrison's \"The Starter Marriage: A Novel\" and Gigi Levangie Grazer's \"The Starter Wife\" referenced Paul's use of the term. The latter became the basis for a USA Network miniseries of the same name in 2007, and a television series that ran from 2008 to 2009, though it expanded the use of the term since the starter marriage in question had produced a daughter.\n"}

It has been the capital of Fuerteventura since 1860. The town's population is 29,160 (2013), the administrative district's (municipio de Puerto del Rosario) population is 36,744 and its area is 289.95 km².\n\nOriginally known as Puerto de Cabras (Port of the Goats), Puerto del Rosario was initially of little political importance on the island, living in the shadow of the ancient capital Betancuria. It had long been a fishing settlement and benefited from a sheltered natural harbour. The \"Atlantic Navigator\", written in 1854, describes the town then known as \"Cabras\" as \"the main port\", but goes on to describe it as an \"insignificant place\". The \"Atlantic Navigator\" describes the makeshift landing area for shipping as \"indifferent\", while calling the \"beach of shingles\" where ships anchor as \"even worse\".\nIt was this status as the \"central port\" of the island that saw it become the capital of the island in 1860, taking that honour from Antigua. The port was popular for shipping goats and this is where its original name came from. However, in 1957, it was decided that the name \"Cabras\" was not suitable. A more attractive name was selected and Puerto de Cabras was renamed Puerto del Rosario (\"rosary port\").\n\nDuring the 1960s there was rural and urban migration from the smaller villages and farm areas of the island into Puerto del Rosario. The population grew in these years. Further population growth occurred in 1976 when, due to the decolonisation of the North African territories like the Spanish Sahara, the Spanish Foreign Legion made Puerto del Rosario their base.\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Puerto del Rosario has a hot desert climate (BWh). \n\nThere are regular ferry services to Las Palmas and Santa Cruz de Tenerife with Naviera Armas. Fuerteventura Airport is situated near El Matorral, 6 km south of Puerto del Rosario.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1941400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941400", "title": "Survival kit", "text": "Survival kit\n\nA survival kit is a package of basic tools and supplies prepared as an aid to survival in an emergency. Civil and military aircraft, lifeboats, and spacecraft are equipped with survival kits.\n\nSurvival kits, in a variety of sizes, contain supplies and tools to provide a survivor with basic shelter against the elements, help him or her to keep warm, meet basic health and first aid needs, provide food and water, signal to rescuers, and assist in finding the way back to help. Supplies in a survival kit normally contain a knife (often a Swiss army knife or a multi-tool), matches, tinder, first aid kit, bandana, fish hooks, sewing kit, and a flashlight.\n\nCivilians such as forestry workers, surveyors, or bush pilots, who work in remote locations or in regions with extreme climate conditions may also be equipped with survival kits. Disaster supplies are also kept on hand by those who live in areas prone to earthquakes or other natural disasters. For the average citizen to practice disaster preparedness, some towns will have survival stores to keep survival supplies in stock.\n\nThe American Red Cross recommends an emergency preparedness kit that is easy to carry and use in the event of an emergency or disaster.\n\nThe general contents of an emergency survival kit depend on the location. Basic components in a survival kit address the needs of first aid, food, water, shelter, navigation, and signalling.\n\nA variety of materials are recommended for emergency shelters, and vary between geographic regions. Options often included in survival kits may consist of:\n\n\nFirst aid kits will often include a combination of the following:\n\n\nMost survival kits include sustenance for short periods of time, to be used and replenished before contents spoil.\n\n\nSince the primary goal of a survival kit for lost or injured persons is rescue, this part of the kit may be considered the most essential. Key elements for rescue include:\n\n\nSurvival kit tools emphasize portability and versatility. Tools recommended for many types of survival kit include:\n\nLifeboat survival kits are stowed in inflatable or rigid lifeboats or life rafts; the contents of these kits are mandated by coast guard or maritime regulations. These kits provide basic survival tools and supplies to enable passengers to survive until they are rescued. In addition to relying on lifeboat survival kits, many mariners will assemble a \"ditch bag\" or \"abandon ship bag\" containing additional survival supplies. Lifeboat survival kit items typically include:\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvival kits for military aviators are often modified according to the environment of operations:\n\n\nThe US Army uses several basic survival kits, mainly for aviators, some of which are stored in carrying bags. Aviators in planes with ejection seats have survival kits in a vest and the seat pan, the survival vest worn by US helicopter crews also contains some basic survival items.\n\nAstronauts are provided with survival kits due to the difficulty of predicting where a spacecraft will land on its return to earth, especially in the case of an equipment failure. In early US space flights, the kit was optimised for survival at sea; the one provided for John Glenn on the first American orbital space flight in Friendship 7 contained \"a life raft, pocket knife, signaling mirror, shark repellent, seawater desalting tablets, sunscreen, soap, first aid kit, and other items\". A survival kit was provided for the Apollo program which was \"...designed to provide a 48-hour postlanding (water or land) survival capability for three crewmen between 40 degrees North and South latitudes\". It contained \"a survival radio, a survival light assembly, desalter kits, a machete, sunglasses, water cans, sun lotion, a blanket, a pocket knife, netting and foam pads\".\n\nThe kits provided for Soviet and Russian Cosmonauts are optimised for survival in the temperate and sub-arctic mountains, forests and grasslands in the east of the country. Soyuz spacecraft kits include \"food rations, water bottles, warm clothing, rope for making a shelter using the capsule’s parachute, fish hooks and miscellaneous other survival gear\". The TP-82 Cosmonaut survival pistol, was provided to defend against predators such as wolves or bears. It was able to fire conventional bullets, shotgun cartridges and flares; the folding stock could be used as a shovel and it also had a fold-out machete.\n\n\"Mini survival kits\" or \"Altoids tin\" survival kits are small kits that contain a few basic survival tools. These kits often include a small compass, waterproof matches, minimum fishing tackle, large plastic bag, small candle, jigsaw blade, craft knife or scalpel blade, and/or a safety pin/s. Pre-packaged survival kits may also include instructions in survival techniques, including fire-starting or first aid methods. In addition, parachute cord can be wrapped around the tin. The parachute cord can be used for setting up an emergency shelter or snaring small animals. They are designed to fit within a container roughly the size of a mint tin.\n\nOther small kits are wearable and built into everyday carry survival bracelets or belts. Most often these are paracord bracelets with tools woven inside. Several tools such as firestarter, buckles, whistles and compass are on the exterior of the gear and smaller tools are woven inside the jewelry or belt and only accessible by taking the bracelet apart.\n\nLightweight survival kits are generally seen as a backup means of survival; however, these can kits can be extensive, and have come to include tools that are generally found in larger kits as survival technology advances. Some examples of these tools are high power flashlights, rapid use saws, signal devices such as mini signal mirrors, and water purification methods.\n\nAnother level in some preparedness plans are Vehicle Kits. In some cases, supplies and equipment may be loaded into vehicle such as a van or truck with bicycle racks and an extra “reserve” gas tank. Some survivalists also carry a small (e.g., 250 cc) off-road-capable motorcycle in the van or truck.\n\nFood supplies in a bug-out vehicle include hundreds of pounds of wheat, rice, and beans, and enough honey, powdered milk, canned goods, bottled fruit, vitamins, dehydrated fruits and vegetables, salt, pepper, spices, and oil for several months. In addition, the kits often contain high-calorie energy bars, a cooking kit, utensils, liquid soap, and towels. The water supplies may include bottled water, filtering kit, bottles, collapsible water containers, and chlorine bleach for water purification. Food preparation and washing equipment may include items such as a grain grinder, a bread mixer, a strainer, a manual can opener, a steam canner with canning jars and O-rings, cutlery, knives, an electric 12-volt cooler icebox, kerosene lamps and heaters, kerosene or propane stoves, extra fuel, a clothes wringer, a foot-operated treadle sewing machine, and an electric hot plate (which would require an inverter to operate off a car battery).\n\nThe medical supplies may include a blood pressure gauge, stethoscope, scissors, tweezers, forceps, disposable scalpels, two thermometers (oral and rectal), inflatable splints, bandages, sutures, adhesive tape, gauze, burn ointment, antibiotic ointment, aspirin, rubbing alcohol, ipecac syrup, sterile water, cotton rags, soap, and cotton swabs.\n\nThe transportation items may include bicycles with off-road tires and suspension, emergency tools and spare auto parts (e.g., fuses, fan belts, light bulbs, head light, tire pump, etc.), and an inflatable raft with paddles.\n\nIn addition, the kits may contain typical individual \"survival kit\" items, such as nylon tarps, extra clothes and coats, blankets, sleeping bags, matches or other fire starting equipment, a compass and maps, flashlights, toilet paper, soap, a pocket knife and bowie knife, a fishing kit, a portable camping stove, a power inverter, backpack, paper and pencil, a signaling mirror, whistle, cable saw, bleach, insect repellent, magnifying glass, rope and nylon cord, pulleys, and a pistol and ammunition.\n\nThe communications equipment may include a multi-band receiver/scanner, a citizens band (CB) radio, portable \"walkie-talkies\" with rechargeable batteries, and a portable battery-powered television. The power supplies may include a diesel or gasoline generator with a one-month fuel supply, an auto battery and charger, extension cord, flashlights, rechargeable batteries (with recharger), an electric multi meter, and a test light. Defense items include a revolver, semi-automatic pistol, rifle, shotgun, ammunition, mace or pepper spray, and a large knife such as a KA-BAR or a bowie knife.\n\nTools may include cutting tools such as saws, axes and hatchets; mechanical advantage aids such as a pry bar or wrecking bar, ropes, pulleys, or a 'come-a-long\" hand-operated winch; construction tools such as pliers, chisels, a hammer, screwdrivers, a hand-operated twist drill, vise grip pliers, glue, nails, nuts, bolts, and screws; mechanical repair tools such as an arc welder, an oxy-acetylene torch, a propane torch with a spark lighter, a solder iron and flux, wrench set, a nut driver, a tap and die set, a socket set, and a fire extinguisher. As well, some survivalists bring barterable items such as fishing line, liquid soap, insect repellent, light bulbs, can openers, extra fuels, motor oil, and ammunition.\n\nThe US government's Homeland Security website provides a list of in-home emergency kit items. The list focuses on the basics of survival: fresh water, food, clean air and materials to maintain body warmth. These basic survival items comprised into a kit are known as a Bug-out bag. The recommended basic emergency kit items include:\n\n\nBelow is list of commonly recommended items for an emergency earthquake kit:\n\n\nFor hurricanes, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recommends that the 'disaster bag' include:\n\n\nThe term \"survival kit\" may also refer to the larger, portable survival kits prepared by survivalists, called \"bug-out bags\" (BOBs), \"Personal Emergency Relocation Kits\" (PERKs) or \"get out of Dodge\" (GOOD) kits, which are packed into backpacks, or even duffel bags. These kits are designed specifically to be more easily carried by the individual in case alternate forms of transportation are unavailable or impossible to use.\n\nThese bags contain supplies such as food, water purification equipment, clothing, medical equipment, communications gear, and tools.\n\n\n\n"}

The band was formed in 1977 as a punk rock outfit, originally under the name Sods (stylized as SODS). The name \"Sort Sol\" was taken in the early 1980s. It translates to English as \"black sun\" and is named after a nature phenomenon particular to Denmark, where huge bird flocks gather in the sky and appear to block out the sun.\n\nThe Danish press often refers to their musical style as punk due to their origin, though nearly everything they have put out since 1980 is more reminiscent of styles such as post-punk, art-rock, gothic rock and even industrial music.\n\nSods was formed in Copenhagen, 1977. The original lineup consisted of: Steen Jørgensen (vocals), Peter Schneidermann (guitar; better known as Peter Peter), Knud Odde (bass) and Tomas Ortved (drums).\n\nThe band released their first studio album \"Minutes to Go\" in February 1979 which is considered the first Danish punk album. They went on to release \"Under en sort sol\" in 1980, a more experimental album, influenced in part by Joy Division, Pere Ubu and Television. T. S. Høeg (saxophone) entered the group for a short while in late 1980.\n\nIn 1981 the group released their first single under the name Sort Sol. The single \"Marble Station\" (with the b-side \"Misguided\") is only released in England on 4AD . In March 1981 the group played their first concert outside of Denmark. 1983 saw the release of the album \"Dagger & Guitar\", featuring punk idol Lydia Lunch on two tracks.\n\nIn 1985 Lars Top-Galia (guitar, previously in the band ADS) joined the group, and the line-up stayed intact until 1996, when Peter Peter left due to disagreements within the band, partly owing to artistic differences.\n\nIn 1988 Sort Sol made the album \"Everything That Rises Must Converge\" which has been described as their artistic breakthrough. The album consists of 10 slowpaced tracks that rely heavily on the deep voice of Steen Jørgensen. In 1991 they made their first CD release which was \"Flow My Firetear\". This was the first of their records reaching a broad audience.\n\nThey reached their peak popularity three years later with \"Glamourpuss\" which by 2002 had sold 122,483 copies in Denmark, more than all their previous records had sold. The Danish hit-movie \"Nattevagten\" used three tracks from \"Glamourpuss\" on the soundtrack, which contributed to the commercial breakthrough of Sort Sol in Denmark.\n\nIn 2004 Lars Top-Galia left the band and Sort Sol's future in jeopardy. Tomas Ortved releases his solo debut \"Sun Pistol\" in 2008. All members are known from various musical or art project throughout the years, which can be found listed in Jan Poulsens biography of the band.\n\nIn March 2009 rumours of a possible comeback began surfacing. On March 17, the Danish tabloid \"Ekstra Bladet\" wrote that Steen Jørgensen have been in contact with all previous Sort Sol members to arrange farewell concerts. However, two days later Lars Top-Galia denied any planned concerts, but confirmed that there have been talks with the old band members. He also said, \"It is not unlikely that we could do in the future, but as I said, there are no concrete plans\".\n\nIn 2011 Sort Sol reunited and toured Denmark with 50 concerts and released \"The Blackest Box\", a collection of all their albums re-mastered and toured again from April–August 2013.\nSort Sol are back in the studio recording new material for the first time in over 11 years. With them in the studio was the american producer Randall Dunn who has recorded for bands like Sunn O)), Akron Family and Kinski. In 2017 Sort Sol released \"Stor langsom stjerne\", which was followed by a tour in Denmark.\n\nInternationally renowned artists who have performed and/or recorded with the group include William S.

The facility was opened in 1963, and became known for its hosting of concerts and professional wrestling events. The Coliseum closed in 2006. In the late-2010's, efforts emerged to help preserve and refurbish the arena as part of a larger redevelopment of the surrounding area.\n\nFrom its construction in 1963, the Coliseum was the very first racially integrated facility in Memphis.\n\nThe arena was one of the few stops on The Beatles' final American tour in 1966. The group played two concerts there on August 19, 1966; in the wake of protests and boycotts of the band over John Lennon's controversial \"more popular than Jesus\" remarks, Memphis city council called for the cancellation of the concerts for safety reasons. The event still went on, although they were met by protests by the Ku Klux Klan, an anonymous assassination threat against \"one or all\" of the band's members, and an audience member exploding a firecracker on-stage during one of the performances (which was initially believed to be a gunshot).\n\nRod Stewart and The Faces played the Coliseum on April 21, 1972 along with the rock band Free.\n\nElvis Presley also performed at the arena. His first show was on March 16, 1974, which was his first Memphis concert since 1961. His March 20 performance was recorded for a concert album, \"Elvis Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis\".\n\nEnglish heavy metal band Judas Priest filmed a December 12, 1982 concert at the Coliseum, later released on video as \"Judas Priest Live\" and on DVD as \"Live Vengeance '82\".\n\nCanadian singer Celine Dion performed a two-night stand at the arena on March 14 and 15, 1997 as part of her Falling Into You Around the World Tour, which was also filmed for the concert video \"Live in Memphis\".\n\nThe Mid-South Coliseum was also well known in professional wrestling as the home base for the United States Wrestling Association and its predecessors; Jerry Lawler headlined hundreds of shows at the facility. Among many notable events, Lawler faced Terry Funk in an \"empty arena fight\" at the Coliseum in 1981. On April 5, 1982, Lawler piledrove comedian Andy Kaufman twice, ending a match between the two in disqualification. Kaufman was taken away in an ambulance. On April 27, 1987, Austin Idol defeated Lawler in a steel cage match, causing the audience to riot. World Championship Wrestling also held several events at the Coliseum over the course of 1996 through 2000.\n\nThe Mid-South Coliseum served as the home of the original Central Hockey League team, the Memphis Wings (later the Memphis South Stars) from 1964 through 1969. To accommodate hockey, piping was installed beneath the Coliseum's floor surface. The ice was often left intact between games, allowing Memphis residents to partake in public skating.\n\nIn 1992, the Memphis RiverKings of the newly re-formed Central Hockey League brought a successful return of professional hockey to the Mid-South Coliseum, drawing good crowds from 1992–2000. Trying political circumstances prevented much-needed updates from being made to the Coliseum, resulting in the RiverKings moving to the new DeSoto Civic Center, now Landers Center, in Southaven, Mississippi in 2000.\n\nThe Memphis Rogues played the 1979–80 season of NASL indoor soccer at the Coliseum. The Rogues won the Western Division and went all the way to the finals, winning Game 1 of the series, 5–4 at home in front of 9,081 fans before losing Game 2 and the mini-game tie breaker to the Tampa Bay Rowdies at the Bayfront Center.\n\nThe Coliseum was home to the American Basketball Association's Memphis Pros. After the New Orleans Buccaneers moved upriver to Memphis in 1971, the Memphis Pros struggled in their first season. The team was then purchased by baseball Oakland A's owner Charlie Finley, who renamed them the Tams and briefly hired Kentucky coach Adolph Rupp as team President. After Finley sold the team, the renamed Sounds also struggled in 1974–75. The franchise left Memphis for Baltimore in 1975, becoming the Baltimore Claws and folded before playing a regular season game.\n\nAs an ABA arena the Coliseum hosted the Indiana Pacers during the 1971 Western Division Semifinals and the Kentucky Colonels during the 1975 Eastern Division Finals; the Pacers went on to win the 1971 ABA Championship and the Colonels went on to win the 1975 ABA Championship.\n\nIt was home to the Memphis Tigers basketball team before the Pyramid opened in 1991 and the Memphis RiverKings before the DeSoto Civic Center opened in 2000. The Coliseum also hosted five Metro Conference men's basketball tournaments.\n\nThe venue closed at the end of 2006, when Memphis and Shelby County Governments refused the request from the Mid-South Coliseum Board to pay its operating losses, which were projected to be $1 million a year. The Coliseum also needed renovations to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nIn 2016, an assessment found that a renovation and restoration of the Coliseum (including ADA compliance) would cost around $23.8 million. In 2018, a group known as the Coliseum Coalition was formed to pursue the preservation of the facility as part of redevelopment of the Memphis Fairgrounds into a youth sports complex. In 2018, a plan was proposed to use funding from the designation of the Fairgrounds as a tourism development zone (TDZ) to \"achieve the reactivation, adaptive reuse, or redevelopment of the Mid-South Coliseum\". The Coliseum was not included in the plan approved the state, but it was suggested that the development could help spur private investment. Coalition member Marvin Stockwell stated that the building was still \"in great shape\".\n\n"}

Opened in 1954, it surpassed the Ak-Sar-Ben Coliseum as the largest convention/entertainment complex in the city, until the completion of CHI Health Center Omaha in 2003. With the opening of the Ralston Arena in 2012, all teams that played at the Civic Auditorium moved, which reduced the venue's viability. The auditorium closed its doors in June 2014 and was demolished two years later.\n\nThe Civic Auditorium arena seated up to 9,300 people for sporting events and up to 10,960 for concerts.\n\nIn the past, the arena was home to the Creighton Bluejays men's basketball team, the Creighton women's basketball and volleyball teams, and the University of Nebraska Omaha hockey team, and the Kansas City-Omaha Kings NBA basketball team.\n\nThe arena was the site of the Missouri Valley Conference men's basketball tournament title game in 1978 and 1981. It was also the site of the WWF In Your House pay-per-view in 1996. Billy Graham's Nebraska Crusade took place at the arena in 1964.\n\nOne of Elvis Presley's final concerts was held at the Civic Auditorium on June 19, 1977. The concert was filmed for a CBS TV special, \"Elvis in Concert\".\n\nA notable event at the Civic Auditorium was the 1988 U.S. vice-presidential debate between Democrat Lloyd Bentsen and Republican Dan Quayle. The debate produced one of the most famous quotes in American political history.\n\nQuayle, then a U.S. Senator from Indiana, had been a relative political unknown and reporters covering the campaign wondered if he would make a suitable president if something were to have happened to George H. W. Bush, who selected him as his running mate. In response to a question, Quayle pointed out that he had as much experience in the Senate as John F. Kennedy had prior to being elected President of the United States in 1960.

I Did It Again\" (2000). It was released on November 13, 2000, by Jive Records as the third single of the album. After meeting with producers Max Martin and Rami in Sweden, the singer recorded several songs for the album, including \"Stronger\". The teen pop and dance-pop song has self-empowerment lyrics about a girl who is tired of her cheating boyfriend and decides to live without him. It received acclaim from music critics, who described the song as both musically and lyrically innovative and considered it the best dance track from the album.\n\n\"Stronger\" achieved commercial success worldwide, reaching the top five in Austria, Germany and Sweden, while reaching the top ten in Finland, Ireland, Switzerland and United Kingdom. \"Stronger\" peaked at number eleven in the United States' \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and was later certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for selling over 500,000 units of the single. An accompanying music video was directed by Joseph Kahn, who considered it as a thematic departure from Spears' previous music videos. The music video received a nomination on the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Pop Video.\n\nSpears has performed \"Stronger\" in a number of live appearances, including at the Radio Music Awards of 2000, American Music Awards of 2001, a Fox special titled \"There's No Place Like Home\", and in two of her concert tours. It was first performed on the \"Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour\" (2000–2001), as the first song from the show and at the \"Dream Within a Dream Tour\" (2001–2002). Also, in 2013 Spears performed the song for the first time in eleven years on her Las Vegas residency concert . In 2010, \"Stronger\" was covered by actor Kevin McHale for an episode of TV series \"Glee\" titled \"Britney/Brittany\". The cover received positive reviews from contemporary music critics.\n\nIn 1999 Spears began work on her second studio album \"Oops!...I Did It Again\" (2000), in Sweden and Switzerland. After meeting with Max Martin and Rami Yacoub in Sweden, Spears recorded several songs for the album, including \"Stronger\", which was co-written and co-produced by Martin and Rami. Upon returning to the United States, the singer revealed in an interview with MTV News that: \"I just got back from Sweden, and did half [of] the material [for \"Oops!\"] over there. I was really, really happy with the material, but we had [such] limited time to get so much done. So I've just really been in the studio nonstop, which is cool, though.\" Spears recorded her vocals for the song in November 1999 at Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. \"Stronger\" was released on November 13, 2000 as the third single from the album.\n\n\"Stronger\" is a teen pop and dance-pop song that features a heavy dance beat, and lasts 3 minutes and 23 seconds. According to the digital music sheet published at Musicnotes.com, the song is composed in the key of G-sharp minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 108 beats per minute, while Spears vocal range spans from C to C. Music critics noticed the song as Spears' declaration of independence, which is perceived in self-empowerment lines such as \"I'm not your property\" and \"I don't need nobody\". Its lyrics also quote Spears' iconic debut hit \"...Baby One More Time\", which was also co-written and produced for Spears by Martin and Yacoub and released two years earlier; the latter's famous chorus, \"My loneliness is killing me\", is answered in \"Stronger\" with the lyric, \"My loneliness ain't killin' me no more\". Despite not being written by the singer, it was speculated that the song is directed to the singer's record label and her management. In a review for the album, David Browne of \"Entertainment Weekly\" noted that \"Stronger\" together with \"Don't Go Knockin' on My Door\" is reminiscent of the Rolling Stones' \"The Last Time\" (1965).\n\n\"Stronger\" was lauded by music critics. Stephanie McGrath of Jam! considered the song \"the best dance track\" of \"Oops!\", deeming the song \"every bit as good as *Nsync's 'Bye, Bye, Bye' or The Backstreet Boys' 'The One'.\" Tracy E. Hopkins of \"Barnes & Noble\", while reviewing the album, said, \"Spears shines on the tongue-in-cheek lead single, the triumphant 'Stronger'...\" David Veitch of the \"Calgary Sun\" considered \"Stronger\" to be as \"another boom-bastic upbeat track\", while saying the song is \"notable for its foghorn synth, fabulous rhythm track and heavy effects applied to Britney's voice. Why she's panting at the end of the bridge is anybody's guess.\" A review by the \"NME\" staff compared \"Stronger\" to songs recorded by ABBA, saying, \"there's the deranged helium synth pop of 'Stronger' with the huge ABBA chord change in the chorus that sounds scarier and more robotic than the Backstreet Boys.\" Andy Battaglia from \"Salon\" said \"Stronger\" \"could crush the entire self-help industry with its melody alone.\" Digital Spy's Alim Kheraj pointed out the \"deeper element of defiance embedded both within the lyrics and the epic chord progressions\".\n\nWriting for \"Pink News\", Mayer Nissim deemed it \"a perfect pop masterpiece\". For Alex Macpherson from \"The Guardian\", it's one of the best examples of Spears' \"distressing vulnerability\" as well as her second best song; \"for the first but by no means last time, Britney embraces the inhuman qualities of her strange, hiccupping voice with vocals distorted and ground up against the beat\". Shannon Barbour from \"Cosmopolitan\" opined that it was \"proof that Empowered Britney is the best Britney\". Similarly, \"Gay Times\" Daniel Megarry called it \"an empowering gay club favourite\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked it at number 14 on their ranking of Spears' songs; \"['Stronger'] foretold the future, both lyrically (she vowed to do things 'my way') and sonically (the stormy electronic touches hinted at a shift in her Scandi-pop sound). Today, it’s the theme song for her resilience\". \"Rolling Stone\" hailed it \"a dance pop anthem of self-empowerment that is both obviously autobiographical and highly relatable to anyone eager to define themselves as a young adult\". Caryn Ganz from \"Spin\" said that \"Britney’s first self-empowerment anthem is still her best: a strutting finger-wagger that’s somehow also a fist-pumper\".\n\nIn the United States, \"Stronger\" peaked at number 11 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on the date of January 27, 2001, after entering the top 40 at number 29 on December 30, 2000.<ref name=\"12/30/00Billboard\"></ref> It also peaked at number 17 on the Top 40 Mainstream chart. It was also certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). \"Stronger\" also peaked at number two on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales component chart, and number 37 on Rhythmic Top 40. As of June 2012, \"Stronger\" has sold 415,000 physical units, with 270,000 paid digital downloads in the United States. It is Spears' third best-selling physical single in the country.\n\n\"Stronger\" also achieved commercial success worldwide, reaching number four in Austria and Sweden, six in Ireland and Switzerland, and eight in Finland, while reaching the top 20 in several European countries. On the week of December 16, 2000, \"Stronger\" debuted at number seven in The Official Charts Company from the United Kingdom, falling to number 11 in the following week. In Australia, the song peaked at number 13, and was later certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), for shipments of more than 70,000 units of the single. In France, \"Stronger\" reached number 20, making it the lowest chart position for the song worldwide. However, it was certified Silver by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP), for selling over 125,000 units of the single. In Germany, the song reached number four on the Media Control Charts, being certified Gold by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI) for shipping over 250,000 units of the single.\n\nThe music video for the song was shot on October 5-7, 2000 at Syncro Aviation Hangar at Van Nuys Airport, Los Angeles, and directed by Joseph Kahn. Kahn revealed that the concept for the music video was created by Spears herself, by saying \"I would like to dance in a chair and drive in a car and break up with [my] boyfriend. [...] Those are your three elements.\" Kahn ended up creating, according to Jocelyn Vena of MTV, \"a semi-futuristic world in which Spears walks into a club, breaks up with her cheating boyfriend and triumphantly walks in the rain, knowing her life is better off without him.\" Kahn also considered the music video as very sophisticated, saying that it is \"definitely a departure from the sort of candy-colored videos she was doing before, so I always thought this was the transition between Britney the teenage pop star and Britney the sort of diva she became.\" An alternate footage of the video can be found on the DVD of Spears first compilation album \"\".\n\nKahn revealed that Spears' referenced Janet Jackson's \"The Pleasure Principle\" and \"Miss You Much\" music videos for the video's chair routine, saying her idea was inspired by \"Janet Jackson's 'Pleasure Principle' — the iconic chair sequence in that\". A review of the video also commented \"Ms. Spears gives us her best Janet Jackson impression (“Miss You Much“) with a dizzying chair-dance routine.\" Spears also referenced and draws inspiration from Jackson in several other music videos, including \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\". \"Overprotected (Darkchild Remix)\", \"Circus\", and \"Womanizer\".\n\nThe video begins with a closed caption that reads \"Britney Spears – Stronger\", amidst the sound of a storm. It then cuts to a close up of Spears looking at her boyfriend, who is smiling with another woman holding him. She realizes she is better without him and walks away, after saying, \"Whatever,\" to the audience. There is a shot of the tower hotel they were in, in an apparent semi-futuristic world, having a party in the restaurant in the hotel tower at the top, and then the hotel tower explodes and blows up. At the beginning of the first chorus, Spears starts dancing with an Emeco 1006-style chair in front of a black background. The second half of the video finds Spears driving away from the party in a classic Ford Mustang car during a thunderstorm; however, before long, her car goes into a spin out, then stops on the very edge of the bridge. After recovering from the shock of it, she's forced to continue walking on in the rain. Cuts of her dancing with a cane, transformed from the chair, are also included. The video ends with Spears walking across a bridge. Two versions of the video exist, one in which at the end of video, Spears stands in mid-air above the spinning chair, and in the other a close up of her singing. Nuzhat Naoreen of MTV praised the music video, saying, \"few performers can work an entire routine on and around a chair as well as Britney did in 'Stronger'\". The music video received a nomination on the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Pop Video.\n\nBritney performed \"Stronger\" for the first time during her Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour in Columbia, U.S.A at June 20, 2000. The show began with the video introduction \"The Britney Spears Experience\", in which three images of Spears welcomed spectators to the show. Then, a giant metal orb was lowered onstage and lifted again to reveal Spears standing behind it. Wearing a glittery jeans and an orange halter top, she opened the show with a dance-oriented performance of the song. \"Stronger\" was last performed on 2002's Dream Within a Dream Tour. After a dance-oriented performance of \"Boys\", Spears performed the song, in which she wore a paint-covered robe and in some shows a bowler hat. Spears also performed the song on several television appearances, including on the American Music Awards of 2001, and on a MTV special titled \"Total Britney Live\". A Fox special titled \"Britney In Hawaii\", aired on June 8, 2000, included an exclusive performance of the song. A performance of \"Stronger\" live from Germany was broadcast on Radio Music Awards of 2000, since Spears was on tour by the time of the awards. \"Stronger\" was not included on the set lists of any of Spears' tours until it was included in her Las Vegas residency show .\n\n\"Stronger\" was covered by Kevin McHale on TV series \"Glee\", on an episode titled \"Britney/Brittany\", that was dedicated to the singer. In the episode, McHale's character Artie has a hallucination of himself singing \"Stronger\" during a dental visit. The cover received positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Raymund Flandez of \"The Wall Street Journal\" enjoyed the cover version, appreciating the twist of having males sing a feminist empowerment song, while Tim Stack of \"Entertainment Weekly\" deemed \"Stronger\" his favorite performance of the episode, as well as the best incorporation of Spears' music, as the song served Artie's storyline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource:\n\n"}

It is located across from the Disneyland Resort on Katella Avenue. The original components, designed by Adrian Wilson & Associates and built by Del E. Webb Corporation, opened in July 1967—including a basketball arena followed shortly by the convention hall. It holds many events, like VidCon, BlizzCon, Anime Expo, D23 Expo, WonderCon, NAMM Show, competitions, and more. In addition to hosting various types of conventions, the Anaheim Convention Center was used to host the wrestling during the 1984 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe center has subsequently undergone six major expansions (1974, 1982, 1990, 1993, 1999–2000, 2016-2017). It is the largest exhibit facility on the West Coast.\n\nOriginally, the arena was home to the Anaheim Amigos of the American Basketball Association during the first ABA season, 1967–68. The franchise relocated to the Los Angeles Sports Arena and became the Los Angeles Stars immediately thereafter; the team eventually moved to Salt Lake City and became the Utah Stars, capturing the 1970–71 ABA Championship. The Stars' subsequent fan support in Utah set the foundation for the NBA's Utah Jazz. The San Diego Friars of WTT played some of their home matches in the arena between 1975 and 1977. In 1978, the Anaheim Oranges of WTT used the arena as their primary home venue. The arena was also home to the California Surf of the NASL for one indoor season (1979–80).\n\nAccording to frequent news reports, the largest exposition held at the Convention Center in recent years has been the Winter NAMM Show. This music-equipment convention (trade only, not open to the general public) had 1,560 exhibitors and a record-breaking 88,100 attendees during the 2008 show. The NAMM Show has been running at the Anaheim Center since 1977, except for a 3-year break in 1998–2000 while the Convention Center underwent major renovations. In 2008, news reports indicated that NAMM's long-term lease with the Anaheim Convention Center authority would end in 2010, and NAMM was applying pressure to the City of Anaheim to further expand and improve the convention center.\n\nThe Anime Expo was hosted at the Anaheim Convention Center in 1996 and again from 2003 through 2006 and was one of the convention center's biggest public events.\n\nBlizzard Entertainment holds BlizzCon at the venue. In 2005, BlizzCon used the northern two conference halls, (and the arena for a concert one evening). In 2007 and 2008, it used three conference halls. In 2009, it used four conference halls. While tickets to the 2007 event sold out in 3 days, tickets to the October 2008 event sold out \"within minutes,\" and tickets to the August 2009 event sold out in \"56 seconds\". Tickets to the 2010 Blizzcon reportedly sold out within 30 seconds.\n\nAnother large convention held at the Center is the Medical Design and Manufacturing Show, held shortly after Winter NAMM.\n\nThe venue served as the site for wrestling at the 1984 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe venue hosted the Big West Conference's men's and women's college basketball tournaments from 2001 to 2010 and hosts the 76 Classic basketball tournament.\n\nIt was briefly home to the Anaheim Arsenal of the basketball league now known as the NBA G League, who relocated to Springfield, Massachusetts for the 2009–10 season and since 2014 have played in Grand Rapids, Michigan as the Grand Rapids Drive.\n\nDuring the 1992 Los Angeles riots, the Los Angeles Clippers were forced to move Game 4 of their NBA playoff series versus the Utah Jazz to the Convention Center.\n\nVidCon has been held at the Anaheim Convention Center since its third annual event in 2012. The new venue offered a much larger capacity than the previously used Hyatt Regency Century Plaza hotel in Los Angeles. WonderCon is hosted annually at the convention center since 2012, with the exception of 2016 when it was held at the Los Angeles Convention Center.\n\nThe 2012 VEX Robotics World Championship was also held in the convention center. Almost 600 teams were present at the competition which utilized two of the convention center's exhibit halls, as well as the convention centers Arena. In 2013 the VEX Robotics World Championship returned to the Anaheim Convention Center, occupying 3 exhibit halls as well as the arena. There were over 700 teams present, representing 24 nations.

{"id": "1941446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941446", "title": "Isabella of Aragon, Duchess of Milan", "text": "Isabella of Aragon, Duchess of Milan\n\nIsabella of Aragon (2 October 1470 – 11 February 1524), also known as Isabella of Naples, was Duchess of Milan by marriage to Gian Galeazzo Sforza and \"suo jure\" Duchess of Bari. Her life was characterised by the political crises surrounding the Italian Wars. Isabella often found herself torn between her native Kingdom of Naples and her marital home of the Duchy of Milan, causing her to suffer personal and political difficulties. After a difficult marriage and lack of support in Milan, she received the Duchy of Bari. This change in circumstances gave Isabella the opportunity to form her own court as well as build up political support and security against the ongoing wars. These reforms along with her interest in arts and literature, resulted in Bari undergoing revival and refurbishment. During this period, she also concentrated on the education of her daughter Bona, who became Queen of Poland.\n\nIsabella was born in the Kingdom of Naples, during the reign of her paternal grandfather Ferdinand I of Naples. She was the daughter of his heir, Prince Alfonso and his first wife, Ippolita Maria Sforza. During her childhood, Isabella's parents had a rough relationship, which was characterised by rivalry and contempt. Alfonso, perhaps threatened by Ippolita's high level of education or disdainful of her pedigree, treated his wife with a lack of respect throughout the marriage. Alfonso preferred the company of his mistress, Trogia Gazzela, by whom he had two illegitimate children during Isabella's childhood. Her grandfather was a courageous ruler, who did not hold back when it came to dealing with his enemies. Being raised at this ruthless court in Naples certainly would have had an effect on Isabella, affecting her character as an adult.\n\nIsabella was the only daughter from the marriage, though she had two brothers: the elder was Prince Ferdinand, who would succeed their father to throne in 1495 and the younger was Piero, who was Lieutenant General of Apulia, but died young of an infection following leg surgery. The siblings were raised alongside their cousins, the children of Eleanor of Naples, who included Isabella and Beatrice d'Este. Isabella had a particularly close relationship with the latter, developing into something of a sisterhood. When the children were just adolescents, Ippolita died.\n\nIsabella's destiny was not to be in the Kingdom of Naples but in the Duchy of Milan. A marriage was arranged for her to a first cousin on her mother's side, Gian Galeazzo Sforza. On 1 May 1480, when Isabella was nine years of age, her betrothal was celebrated within the Duchy. It would not be until nine years later that the planned wedding took place. On 26 December 1488, the eighteen-year-old Isabella left her childhood home by sea for Genoa and from there, she travelled to Milan to join her husband. The couple officially married on 2 February 1489.\n\nGreat celebrations followed the marriage. A masque or operetta was held, it was entitled \"Il Paradiso\", with words by Bernardo Bellincioni and sets and costumes by Leonardo da Vinci. Isabella was praised for her beauty, the Ferrarese ambassador commented: \"\"she was so beautiful and radiant that she seemed like the sun\"\". The operetta was written very much with this praise for Isabella in mind. \"Il Paradiso\" was the representation of the seven planets orbiting round. A man portrayed each of the planets and all would speak praise of Isabella. Therefore, the operetta depicted Isabella as being at the centre of the universe. In addition to the acknowledgment of her physical appearance, Isabella was also noted for having an energetic personality.\n\nThe bridegroom was quite a contrast to his wife; Gian Galeazzo was pale, studious and melancholy. The differences of personality would certainly affect the marriage as well as in politics during the 1490s.\n\nGian Galeazzo had been duke since he was aged seven; due to his youth, his uncle, Ludovico Sforza, had been acting as regent. By the time of the wedding, Ludovico had been in power for almost thirteen years and showed no sign of relinquishing the reins of government to his nephew. He viewed the young couple with suspicion, as potential figureheads for opposition to his position. This was worsened in 1491, when Isabella gave birth to a son and heir Francesco. In order to weaken any coup attempts made by Isabella and her husband, Ludovico had her Neapolitan retinue returned home and restricted the young duchess from appointing and rewarding followers.\n\nOne source of comfort to Isabella was the presence of Beatrice, who married Ludovico in 1491. The young cousins socialised regularly: they went hunting, played endless games of \"palla\" and designed dresses that they wished to have made. Beatrice was regarded as naughtier than Isabella, often persuading her cousin to participate in other activities, such as wandering around the market place dressed in disguise and without a chaperone. \n\nDespite this early warmth between the cousins, their relationship suffered due to Ludovico's political schemes. The birth of Beatrice's son, Maximilian, was greeted by great pomp and ceremony, befitting an heir, something that had been denied to Isabella's son. In addition, Leonardo da Vinci was active in creating pageants and decorations in honour of Beatrice, despite the fact that she was not the highest ranking woman at the Milanese court. Beatrice was even given a political role, acting as ducal ambassador to Venice in 1492.\n\nLudovico was now openly pursuing his ambition for absolute control over Milan. An important aspect of this was foreign policy, and his anti-Aragonese policy was far from favourable to Isabella or her Neapolitan family. In response to Ludovico's actions, Isabella's father had encouraged French ambitions over Milan. Understanding the weight of this threat, Ludovico severed diplomatic ties with the Neapolitan court and built an alliance with Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. The reason for this particular alliance was that the Emperor had the power to grant the Dukedom to Ludovico. Meanwhile, Isabella found herself confined to Castello Visconteo in Pavia, the disputed duchess was essentially a prisoner.\n\nLudovico encouraged Charles VIII of France to attack Naples and remove the threat of Isabella's father. When the French King arrived in the Duchy of Milan in October 1494, on his way to Naples, he was well-received by Ludovico and Beatrice. Around this time, Isabella made a move and appealed to Charles. She tearfully pleaded for the King to have mercy on her father; Charles was embarrassed by Isabella's actions but he did have sympathy for her husband, who was dying. Isabella's pleading was in vain, the Italian Wars were underway and her father would be ousted from his throne by the French in 1495. In his infamous work \"The Prince\", Niccolò Machiavelli blamed Ludovico for the devastation, claiming that it was down to him inviting the French to attack Naples.\n\nWhen Isabella appealed to the French King, the historian Philippe de Commines had been a part of his retinue. He had the following to say about her actions: \"She had better have prayed for herself, who was still a young and fair lady.\" This quote has particular relevance when observing that the fall of Naples was not the only tragedy to befall her at this time. The sickly Gian Galeazzo died on 21 October 1494, in the confinement that he shared with Isabella in Pavia. Until the end, he was completely in his uncle's thrall. The couple had been married for just five years and like the marriage of Isabella's parents, theirs had been a difficult one. Gian Galeazzo appeared to have no interest in exerting his authority in Milan nor did he support his wife when she became the target of Ludovico's schemes.\n\nThe aftermath of this loss led to another problem. Having built up his support base over the years, Ludovico could easily bypass the claims of Isabella's son and obtain the dukedom which he had been the de facto ruler of for eighteen years. Isabella was at a low point; Ludovico may have allowed her to live in the ducal apartment with all her honours intact, but she had lost the father of her children, her Neapolitan family support had been destroyed by the French and her son had been denied his birthright.\n\nDuring the remaining years of the 1490s, Isabella and her children were under the watchful eye of Ludovico at Sforza Castle. Further deaths followed. In 1496, Isabella's brother Ferdinand died, this made her the heir of the Brienne claim to the title King of Jerusalem. In 1497, Beatrice, Isabella's one-time friend and rival died in childbirth, aged twenty-one. This was only the beginning of Ludovico's misfortunes. Two years later, he was toppled from power by Louis XII of France. However, any satisfaction that Isabella could have gained from witnessing the downfall of her rival was minimised. Isabella petitioned Louis to name her son the Duke of Bari, a title that belonged to the Milanese family. Louis responded by taking the young boy to France, assuring Isabella that he planned to marry him with his daughter. In reality, Louis deceived Isabella by placing Francesco in a monastery. She refused to give up hope for her son's return and petitioned Emperor Maximilian to liberate him from France. However, this effort proved fruitless. She never saw her son again. This, along with the destruction of her family in Naples, led to Isabella developing a hatred for the French.\n\nHaving unsuccessfully petitioned Louis and fearing for her safety in Milan, Isabella left for Naples, where her uncle Frederick had succeeded her childless brother as king. She took Bona and Ippolita with her. However, the situation was not safe, Louis was determined to once again press the French claim on Naples. The representatives of Louis XII and those of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella of Castile signed a secret treaty in Granada on November 11, 1500. The French and Aragonese sovereigns agreed to attack Naples, conquer it and immediately divide it between themselves. Louis XII would receive Naples, Terra di Lavoro and Abruzzo and the titles of King of Jerusalem and King of Naples; Jerusalem was Isabella's by right.\n\nReflecting upon the tragedies that had befallen her, Isabella began signing herself off in letters as \"Isabella, unique in misfortune\".\n\nAfter the collapse of the Sforzas in Milan and her family in Naples, Isabella was granted the title of \"suo jure\" Duchess of Bari, Princess of Rossano and Lady of Ostuni, which Louis had denied to her son. She ruled there from 1500 until her death twenty-four years later. Ironically, Isabella now appeared as a usurper herself as Bari should have passed to Maximilian, the son of Ludovico and Beatrice. Her acquisition of the Duchy appears to be a form of compensation for her previous struggles.\n\nIsabella's life in Bari was one of splendour. She lived in Castello Normanno-Svevo and spent her spare time working on music and literature. She summoned the writer Amedeo Cornale to her court, which witnessed the printing of Bari's first book. Her administration greatly benefited the Duchy, which entered into a period of revival, refurbishment and cultural florescence, which it had not enjoyed under the earlier administration of Isabella's Aragonese relatives.\n\nKeeping in mind her previous life experiences, Isabella made it her priority to enhance the castle's defences, ensuring that it was up to date with the form of warfare that had harmed Milan and Naples. This emphasis on security turned out to be well placed. In July 1502, Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba distributed a small portion of his forces to Bari, under Isabella's protection. This led to the French considering an attack on Isabella's Duchy, some argued it would be an advantageous way of conducting war against the Spanish. However, this was avoided when ideas of chivalry were taken into consideration. Whilst Isabella may have avoided danger on the count of her gender, it was a reminder that her hold on Bari was far from secure and her gender may not always excuse her.\nAside from building up defences, the situation in Milan had taught Isabella that political security was also essential; her will needed to be upheld at all times, never weakened or undermined. Therefore, she introduced more vigorous surveillance of public officials, ensuring that their notorious corruption was combated. \n\nAlthough it may appear that Isabella had finally found fortune, these later years were also plagued with family tragedies. In 1501, her elder daughter and namesake of her mother, Ippolita died around the age of eight. In 1512, her nephew, Rodrigo, whom Isabella had fostered since 1506, died aged twelve. Eleven years after young Ippolita's death, Francesco followed his sister to the grave. Isabella then dedicated herself to raising her sole surviving child, Bona. Under Isabella's direction, Bona received a humanist education, which included the teaching of statecraft. This education prepared Bona for her future role as Queen consort of Poland.\n\nInitially, Isabella desired for Bona to wed her cousin, Maximilian Sforza, in the hope of uniting their two rival branches of the family. However, Sforza control over the duchy proved too weak at this point and the French took it over once again in the aftermath of the Battle of Marignano in 1515.\n\nIn the same year, Barbara Zápolya, wife of Sigismund I the Old died. The marriage had not produced male issue and so it was expected that the Polish king would remarry. Zápolya came from an anti-Habsburg family, something Emperor Maximilian was conscious of. In order to eliminate anti-Habsburg sentiments within Poland, the Emperor requested that Sigismund marry a bride selected by him. Bona was on the list of selected candidates. As the other candidates were ruled out for various reasons, Sigismund consented to marrying Bona in the spring of 1517. Isabella raised extra taxes in Bari to pay for the wedding.\n\nLike her mother, Bona was known for her energetic personality; she was not afraid to openly disagree with her husband and acted as a patron to artists. However, unlike Isabella, Bona was able to build up her own political faction in her marital homeland. In her final years, Isabella saw her daughter become a mother to four of her six children, amongst them were Isabella and Anna Jagiellon. Not giving up on uniting the rival branches of the Sforza family, Isabella sent envoys to Poland to propose marriage of her granddaughter, the younger Isabella, to Francesco II Sforza, newly installed Duke of Milan. However, Sigismund refused as the duchy was contested and Francesco's hold was tenuous.\n\nIsabella died in Bari on 1 February 1524, aged fifty-three. She had been Duchess for twenty-four years and a widow for thirty. The Italian Wars were still ongoing at the time. Her body was returned to Naples and buried in San Domenico Maggiore. Bona succeeded her in Bari, returning years later as a widow, during the final year of her own life in 1557.\n\nIn 2012, anthropologists excavated the body of Isabella, and concluded that she had syphilis. Her teeth had a high level of mercury, which was used (ineffectively) to treat syphilis, and had given a black color to the tooth enamel, most of which had been removed by abrading. They concluded that she was poisoned by her own medicine. \nIsabella was first suggested as the subject of da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" in 1979. This presupposes that the painting took place in the 1490s, during da Vinci's Milanese period. However, the painting has officially been dated as later, likely ruling Isabella out as the subject. Additionally, Isabella was never recognised during her lifetime as the subject of the painting. Those who viewed the \"Mona Lisa\" and were acquainted with Isabella such as Luigi d'Aragona and his secretary, Antonio de Beatis, did not make a connection.\n\nShe appears in Hella Haasse's 1952 novel \"The Scarlet City\", depicted during her time as Duchess of Bari with mention of her difficult early life.\n\n"}

He was educated at the University of Manitoba, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering. He worked as an automobile and implement agent, and was the president of Christianson Ltd. and Koko Platz Development Ltd. From 1942 to 1945, he served as a pilot in the Royal Canadian Air Force.

Internet begging is also commonly done among acquaintances on social media platforms, such as requests for donations from friends and family members to pay for normal educational expenses.\n\nA cause website is a cyber-begging site that presents a personal appeal for funds or help.\n\nDuring the early days of the Internet, cyber-begging was evident in the form of personal advertisements for help on local bulletin board systems (BBS). As personal websites became more popular, individuals began advertising their needs using the features available through website authoring. Many Internet service providers (ISPs) offered a free homepage along with the basic dial-up connection service to the Internet. For many people, this was an opportunity to create an inexpensive website to host and share their personal experience and need.\n\nAs non-profit organizations began moving their fundraising efforts from snail mail (postal mail) to the World Wide Web, individuals began to create more elaborate forms of personal 'fundraising' by utilizing many of the same Internet techniques.\n\nDuring the late 1990s, as the Internet became more sophisticated, resources became available allowing any individual to create an attractive website without requiring the knowledge of HTML or other web authoring systems. These free-to-inexpensive web hosting services remain a constant on the Internet making it easy for the public to access, create and advertise an Internet begging website.\n\nInternet begging gained notoriety and momentum after June 2002 when Karyn Bosnak started SaveKaryn.com as an attempt to have the Internet public help pay her credit card debt, which was in part due to her predilection for designer clothing and Starbucks coffee. For Bosnak, the results led to traditional media attention, appearances on popular television programs and a book. Her website was probably the first Internet begging site to gain wide exposure and it became the example for many to follow.\n\nIn October 2009, the \"Boston Globe\" carried a story on so-called cyberbegging, or Internet begging, which was reported to be a new trend worldwide.\n\nWith hundreds of Internet begging sites on-line, it has become common practice for web beggars to register and own the domain name of their websites. Using free or inexpensive hosting services and specialized websites such as GoFundMe, Internet begging websites ask the public for help with many needs including breast augmentation surgery, cancer treatments, new cars, preventing personal homelessness, and medical bills to suggest a few. Websites with names reflecting their needs directly or indirectly are panhandling for help with a variety of human needs and conditions, from deeply personal to very humorous.\n\nMany 'cause websites' accept contributions via clickable hyperlinks. Internet services like PayPal and the Amazon.com Honor system offer free to inexpensive credit card and payment acceptance services making it easy for cyber-beggars to collect donations directly from their websites.\n\nMany of the Internet begging websites appear to be the result of an individual's legitimate desire for attention and help. However, a new trend is emerging in 'Mega' begging sites that are ostensibly offering would be Internet beggars help with the details of website design, hosting and advertising.\n\nInternet begging websites are essentially as transient as traditional off-line panhandlers with respect to territory and accessibility. Many Internet begging websites are not long lived.\n\nSometimes beggars use the chat facility in online poker rooms to beg for money. This practice often occurs at high-stakes tables, where the beggars may believe they have a better chance of being paid by people who play for high stakes. However, this practice is usually frowned upon, and most online poker rooms employ countermeasures to prevent it. These countermeasures include revoking offenders' chat privileges, limiting chat to seated players only, and placing limitations on who may chat as an observer.\n\n"}
{"id": "1941458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941458", "title": "Adenia", "text": "Adenia\n\nAdenia is a genus of flowering plants in the passionflower family, Passifloraceae. It is distributed in the Old World tropics and subtropics. The centers of diversity are in Madagascar, eastern and western tropical Africa, and Southeast Asia. The genus name \"Adenia\" comes from \"aden\", reported as the Arabic name for the plant by Peter Forsskål, the author of the genus.\n\nAll \"Adenia\" are perennial plants, but there are many different forms, including herbs, vines, lianas, shrubs, and trees. Many are succulents and some are pachycauls. Some have fibrous root systems and some have tubers. \"Adenia\" can be found in a wide variety of habitat types, from dry African deserts to wet Southeast Asian rainforests. There are some 100 species in the genus.\n\n\"Adenia\" have alternately arranged leaves borne on petioles. There are two glands located near the attachment of the blade to the petiole. Most species are dioecious. Inflorescences of a few to many flowers occur in the leaf axils. There is a stipe below the flower. The calyx of sepals around the base of the flower has five lobes. The five petals are usually smaller than the sepals and may be whitish or greenish. The male flower has five stamens. In the female flower these are reduced to staminodes. There are three styles tipped with stigmas that may be long-hairy to very woolly. The fruit is a red capsule. Each black seed has a fleshy aril.\n\n\"Adenia\" species can be difficult to identify and distinguish. Individuals of a species can be variable. One plant can have leaves of varying shapes and sizes, and young and old specimens can have different leaf types. Some taxa are poorly represented in herbarium collections, leaving few examples to compare with new specimens. Records of some taxa lack descriptions of both flower types. Many species only flower for a few weeks, and during this time they may also lose their leaves. Succulent plants can be difficult to properly collect and preserve.\n\nSeveral species are used in traditional African medicine. Various parts of \"A. cissampeloides\" are used to treat many conditions, including gastrointestinal problems, inflammation, pain, fever, malaria, leprosy, scabies, cholera, anemia, bronchitis, sexually transmitted diseases, menorrhagia, and mental illness. It is used both as an abortifacient and to prevent miscarriage. \"A. dinklagei\" leaves are ingested to treat palpitations. The leaves of \"A. tricostata\" are used to treat fever. The leaves or leaf sap of \"A. bequaertii\" are taken to treat headache, mental illness, and possession. \"A. lobata\" stems are applied to sites of Guinea worm infection during extraction of the worm. It is also used as an enema and an aphrodisiac.\n\n\"A. cissampeloides\" is used as a fish poison and arrow poison. The red-colored sap is used as a cosmetic. The stems can be made into rope. The crushed twigs or smoke from burning roots can be used to calm honeybees during honey harvest.\n\nThe leaves of \"A. cissampeloides\" are eaten as a vegetable in parts of Africa.\n\n\"A. digitata\" is cultivated as an ornamental plant for its very large, distinctive aboveground tuber.\n\nMany \"Adenia\" are poisonous. They contain lectins such as lanceolin, stenodactylin, and volkensin, which are toxic to cells. They cause apoptosis, hemagglutination, inhibition of protein synthesis, and depurination of ribosomes and DNA. Mouse experiments with small doses of lanceolin and stenodactylin, from \"A. lanceolata\" and \"A. stenodactyla\", respectively, revealed that they are \"amongst the most potent toxins of plant origin\".\n\nThe fruit of \"A. digitata\" has been used in Africa to commit homicide and suicide.\n\nThere are approximately 100 species in the genus.\n\nSpecies include:\n\n\n"}

The band is composed of Stephen McBean, Jeremy Schmidt, Adam Bulgasem, Rachel Fannan, Arjan Miranda. Since forming in 2004, Black Mountain has released five LPs, \"Black Mountain\" (2005), \"In the Future\" (2008), \"Wilderness Heart\" (2010), \"IV\" (2016) and \"Destroyer\" (2019); two EPs and a number of singles, mostly on the Jagjaguwar label.\n\nStephen (Gord) Gordon McBean (b. 1969), was born in Vancouver and grew up in Kleinburg and Sidney (BC). As a teenager he became interested in music and became part of the local punk-rock scene in Victoria. He formed his first band, Jerk Ward, in 1981. in 1984, the band recorded a demo that was re-released in 2009 as \"Too Young To Thrash\". The band evolved into Mission of Christ (MOC) who recorded a split 7\" in 1987.Two years later the band broke up and McBean moved to Vancouver where he started the band Gus. They released two singles, a split EP and an album \"The Progressive Science of Breeding Idiots for a Dumber Society\" (1995). The band gave McBean his first experience with extensive touring and he later described the experience as a \"bit of noise, bit of Melvins, funk, the Amrep stuff that was going on then. Lots of screaming. Lasted four years\".\n\nIn 1996 McBean asked drummer Joshua Wells (Radio Berlin) to join his band Ex Dead Teenager. By 1999 it had morphed into a duo of Wells and McBean as Jerk With a Bomb. They signed with Scratch Records and Jagjaguwar in the US, and released three albums: \"Death to False Metal\" (1999), \"The Old Noise\" (2001) and \"Pyrokinesis\" (2003). The latter featured Amber Webber of Dream on Dreary on vocals.\n\nWhile McBean and Wells were still performing as Jerk With a Bomb in 2003, McBean began to demo material that included the song \"Black Mountain\". At the start of 2004, the two began working on the demos under the same name with contributions from Webber, bassist Matt Camirand and keyboard player Jeremy Schmidt. They recorded the eight track, self-titled debut album during the first half of the year. McBean would later describe the change as \"it was almost like a release. I mean, I loved Jerk With A Bomb, but it got to a point where I was done with it, I was through with that part of my life\".\n\nThe first release under the new name was a split 7\" with Destroyer that featured the song \"Bicycle Man\". The album was released in through Scratch Records in Canada in December 2004, while Jagjaguwar put it out a month later. The band toured around North America and Europe, while in June the 12\" single \"Druganaut\" b/w \"Buffalo Swan\" was released in the US. In August 2005 the band opened for Coldplay on their Twisted Logic Tour for three weeks, with their final opening in San Diego. In the same month the album was released in Germany through City Slang Records.\n\nA vinyl single was released in April 2007 named \"Surrender Sound Session: Unkle vs. Autolux/Black Mountain\" with a remix of \"No Hits\" on the B side.\n\nTheir second album \"In the Future\" was a finalist for the 2008 Polaris Music Prize and was also nominated for \"Best Alternative Album\" in the 2009 Juno Awards. The song \"Stay Free\" from \"In the Future\" was featured on the Spider-Man 3 soundtrack.\n\nIn September 2010 Black Mountain performed in an amphitheater located in the woods of Oisterwijk at the Incubate (festival) in Tilburg, Netherlands.\n\nLeader Stephen McBean also heads another similarly named band, Pink Mountaintops, while Webber performs with the band Kodiak Deathbeds and Lightning Dust.\n\nSeveral members of the band have, for as long as a decade, worked for organizations that meet the basic living requirements of the chronically poor, drug addicted and mentally ill in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside neighborhood, such as Insite. In an interview, the band said: \"After work we all try not to think too hard about the effect it has on our lives. It keeps us grounded.\"\n\nIn 2010 McBean moved to Los Angeles. The band released their third album \"Wilderness Heart\" in September 2011, which was produced by Randall Dunn and Dave Sardy. It was named as a longlisted nominee for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize, and appeared on the !earshot Top 50 chart.\n\nOn April 1, 2016, they released their fourth studio album, \"IV\". A fifth studio album, \"Destroyer\", was released on 24 May 2019. \"Let Spirits Ride\" was featured in an episode of the ABC network television show, \"The Rookie,\" in March 2019. \"Future Shade\" featured on Sportsnet's \"Hockey Night in Canada\" in May 2019.

Located at 3875 Holman Street, it is home to the Houston Cougars men's and women's basketball teams and the women's volleyball team. Previously, the arena was opened in 1967 as Hofheinz Pavilion, named after Roy Hofheinz and his late wife, Irene Cafcalas \"Dene\" Hofheinz, after they donated $1.5 million to help fund construction. Roy Hofheinz, known as Judge Hofheinz, was a UH alumnus and a Houston politician, businessman, and philanthropist. The arena is now named after restaurant magnate and UH alum Tilman Fertitta, who donated $20 million toward the complete renovation of the arena in 2016. The court is named for hall of fame and former Cougars coach Guy V. Lewis. The arena also contains an alcove dedicated to Basketball Hall of Famer Elvin Hayes, a Cougar player in the 1960s and NBA star in the 1970s. Like many arenas of its kind, the seating bowl of Fertitta Center is dug into the ground so that one enters the building at the top of the bowl.\n\nIn June 2010, the University of Houston announced a $40 million plan to renovate Hofheinz Pavilion. Ultimately in November 2015, the Board of Regents approved a $60 million complete re-design of the facility to open in 2018, funded in part by a $20 million gift from UH alum Tilman Fertitta. After the Hofheinz family objected to the building's being renamed, the school and the family reached a settlement to honor Judge Hofheinz by building a plaza containing a bronze statue of him near the facility. In addition, the UH library will archive Hofheinz's historical records in a special section. Finally, UH will petition the city of Houston to change the name of Holman Street between Cullen Boulevard and Scott Street to honor the Hofheinz family. The renovation began in March 2017 at the conclusion of the 2016–17 basketball seasons, and was scheduled to be completed in time for the 2018–19 men's and women's basketball seasons, but construction delays pushed the reopening date to December 1, 2018. Both basketball teams played their home games on the campus of nearby Texas Southern University during the course of construction.\n\nThe Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) used the arena as their first home in Houston, from 1971 to 1975. In addition to athletics, the arena has been used for other purposes such as UH graduation ceremonies and area high school commencements. It has also hosted many concerts by famous artists. The Summit took over for much of these purposes in the city after its construction in 1975.\n\nPrior to 1969, the basketball team of the University of Houston hosted their home games at high school arenas such as Jeppesen Gym and Delmar Field House. Hofheinz Pavilion was meant to replace these venues as a permanent location.\n\nThe first athletic event at Hofheinz Pavilion was held on December 1, 1969 when the Houston Cougars men's basketball team defeated Southwestern Louisiana 89–72 before a crowd of 7,000.\n\nWhen the team relocated from San Diego in 1971, the NBA's Houston Rockets used the venue as their home arena, although selected games were played at the Astrodome. The Rockets played at Hofheinz Pavilion during their first four seasons in Houston until the construction of The Summit was completed in 1975.\n\nOn March 5, 1990, Hofheinz Pavilion hosted its largest number of spectators to date when a crowd of 10,660 attended a men's basketball game in which Houston beat Texas.\n\nA new ceiling, lighting and sound system were installed in 1991. Through a donation by alumni John and Rebecca Moores in 1992, the basketball locker rooms were enlarged and equipped with personal lockers for each player. Also added was a meeting area and lounge furnished with couches, a color television, a stereo sound system and a pull-down projection screen.\n\nIn 1995, the court was renamed to \"Guy V. Lewis Court at Hofheinz Pavilion\" in honor of College Basketball Hall of Fame coach Guy V. Lewis.\n\nIn 1998, Hofheinz Pavilion again underwent a renovation as part of a capital improvement campaign undertaken by the university to upgrade its athletic facilities. In its original format Hofheinz Pavilion had a seating capacity of 10,000. As part of the renovation, a ring of luxury suites was added to the top of the seating bowl. This addition necessitated the removal of 1,500 seats, reducing capacity to 8,479. The new Connor Uni-Force Flooring System was installed in October 2004. In June 2010, the University of Houston announced its intention to undergo a $40 million renovation and expansion to Hofheinz Pavilion after a four-month feasibility study conducted by AECOM. This would mark the largest single financial investment to the arena to that point.\n\nRenovations to the facility began in March 2017 at the conclusion of the 2016–17 basketball season. The $60 million project was funded primarily by a $20 million donation from Tilman Fertitta, a UH alumnus who is also chairman of the UH board of regents. As part of the project, the interior of the arena was demolished and rebuilt into a modern 7,100-seat sports and entertainment facility. Work was scheduled to be completed by the start of the 2018–19 men's and women's basketball seasons; however, construction delays pushed the reopening back to December 1, 2018. During renovations, the building took on water from Hurricane Harvey, which turned the stripped-down arena bowl into a \"swimming pool\". A red line painted in the visitor's tunnel marks the height of the flood waters during the storm. Both the men's and women's basketball teams played at Health and Physical Education Arena at Texas Southern University during the length of the renovations, which spanned the entire 2017–18 season and the first month of the 2018–19 season.\n\nThe newly christened Fertitta Center reopened on December 1, 2018, with the men's basketball team beating the Oregon Ducks 65–61 in a nationally televised game.\n\nHofheinz Pavilion has hosted George Harrison, Elton John, Faces, Traffic, Jethro Tull, The Clash, Procol Harum, Elvis Presley, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Frank Zappa, Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, The Who, The Rolling Stones, The Jackson 5, Alice Cooper, Bob Dylan, The Band, Prince & The New Power Generation, Madonna, Genesis, and Yes.\n\nNine of the fifteen songs featured in the concert film \"Ladies and Gentlemen – The Rolling Stones\" were filmed at Hofheinz Pavilion on June 25, 1972 – 5 from the 4:00 pm show, and 4 from the 9:00 pm show.\n\nOn Halloween in 1976, Parliament-Funkadelic, accompanied by opening acts Bootsy's Rubber Band and Sly and the Family Stone brought their P-Funk Earth Tour to the Hofheinz Pavilion. The P-Funk and Bootsy performances were released on VHS in 1986 and on DVD in 1998. They continued to perform sold-out shows at the venue in 1977, 1978, and 1979.\n\nPrince held several shows at Hofheinz Pavilion on his Musicology Tour in 2004. Popular music concerts are still held at the Fertitta Center, often when a major act decides against playing at the larger (and ticketing industry-controlled) venues in town. Among recent examples have been concerts by acts including P!nk, Taylor Swift (both in 2009), Chris Brown, Katy Perry (both in 2011), Eric Church (in 2012), Muse and the Zac Brown Band (both in 2013). Houston native David Cook played at Hofheinz Pavilion as part of the 2008 edition of the American Idols Live! Tour. In 2014, A live concert The Grateful Dead played there on November 18, 1972 was released on compact disc and limited-edition vinyl.\n\nIn 2019, the Professional Bull Riders' Unleash the Beast Series made their first visit to Fertitta Center; it was the PBR's first event in Houston since 2012 (when they held a Built Ford Tough Series event at NRG Stadium). On April 29, 2020, it will host an episode of \"AEW Dynamite\".\n\n"}

Standing right in the city centre on Kalinin Prospekt, a barefoot man dressed in a tattered coat appeals to anyone with a strange request: \"Tell me the number of your planet in the tenture? Or least the number of your galaxy in the spiral?\". Uncle Vova and a young Georgian student with a violin (The Violinist), stop and talk to the strange man. During a short conversation the stranger shows them a teleportation device – \"traveler\". Uncle Vova decides to test the veracity of the stranger's story and, despite the stranger's warnings, presses a random button on the device. Suddenly Uncle Vova and the Violinist find themselves transported to the planet \"Pluke\" in the \"Kin-dza-dza\" galaxy.\n\nThe natives of the planet appear human, with deceptively primitive-looking technology and a barbaric culture, which satirically resembles that of humans. They are telepathic; the only spoken words normally used in their culture are “ku” (koo) and “kyu” (kyoo), the former stands for everything good, the latter being a swear word or stands for every bad thing. However, the Plukanians are able to quickly adapt to understand and speak Russian and Georgian. The society of Pluke is divided into two categories: \"Chatlanians\" and \"Patsaks\". The difference is ascertained only by means of a small handheld device (\"visator\"), similar to flash drive in appearance; when pointed at a member of the Chatlanian group, an orange light on the device comes on; when pointed at a member of the Patsak group, a green light comes on. It is also noted that the social differences between Patsaks and Chatlanians are not constant: Pluke being a Chatlanian planet, so Chatlanians are privileged, and a system of rituals must be followed by the Patsaks to show flattery; but there are Patsak planets where Patsaks hold the upper hand and Chatlanians are subservient. The visator shows that Uncle Vova and the Violinist are Patsaks.\n\nThe only group allowed to use weapons (\"“tranklucators”\") and enforce their will are the \"ecilops\" (\"police\" spelled backwards in Russian). Outside being a Patsak or Chatlanin, respect towards others is determined by the color of their pants; different shades require those of lower social standing to \"ku\" at them a predetermined number of times, displaying their submission. The nominal leader of the Plukanian society is \"Mr. P-Zh\"; everybody makes their best to display fervent worship to him and disrespect is severely punished; but, when encountered in person, P-Zh appears harmless and dumb. The fuel of Pluke is called \"luts\" and is made from water. All naturally present water has apparently been processed into luts, so drinking water is a valuable commodity (in fact, it can only be made from luts).\n\nA good deal of the plot is based on the fact that ordinary wooden matchsticks (\"ketse\") (or, rather, the chemicals of the match head) are considered to be extremely valuable on Pluke. Uncle Vova and the Violinist meet two locals, Uef and Be, who at various points either help or abandon the duo from Earth in their quest to return to Earth, which at various times involves repairing Uef and Be's ship or raiding P-Zh's private compound.\n\nUncle Vova and the Violinist finally encounter the man from the film's beginning, but he disappears, making it uncertain if he took them with him. The film then jumps back to the very beginning, as Uncle Vova heads outside however there is no man at the city center, where he runs into the Violinist, however they do not recognize each other. Suddenly, a passing tractor with an orange flashing light reminds them of the \"ecilops\" and they both reflexively squat and say, \"ku!\" as was required on Pluke. They immediately recognize each other. Uncle Vova, looking at the sky, hears the sound of a song performed by the Uef and Be.\n\n\nThe movie has been released on DVD in Russia but has gained virtually no notice elsewhere, with the exception of Japan. This is largely due to the fact that there was no official release of the movie with English subtitles for a long time. While the movie was in the making, a censorship threat emerged due to the use of the word Ku (Koo) which sounded like the initials \"K. U.\" of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the USSR at the time, K. U. Chernenko. Chernenko who assumed the leadership in 1984, died in 1985, and this removed the danger.\n\nIn 2005 RUSCICO (Russian Cinema Council) released a version with Russian original sound and with English and French dubbing, It has also subtitles in English and other languages.\n\nSince 2013, a digitally-restored Blu-ray Disc version is available.\n\nThe film is available with English subtitles on YouTube via Mosfilm \n\nThirty years after its original release, \"Little White Lies\" magazine described \"Kin-dza-dza!\" as \"\"Mad Max\" meets Monty Python by way of Tarkovsky\" and said it had remained relevant to audiences. \"Russia Beyond\" agreed that the film was still well-loved by Russians in 2016.\n\nOn December 1, 2016, Google celebrated the 30th anniversary of \"Kin-Dza-Dza!\" with a Google Doodle.\n\nIn 2013, Daneliya released an animated remake of his film, named \"Ku! Kin-dza-dza!\" (). The animated version was based on the same plot, but targeted more towards children and the international audience. It had a budget of 140 million rubles. \"Ku! Kin-dza-dza!\" won Best Animated Feature Film in the 2013 Asia Pacific Screen Awards. The animated remake is mainly a traditionally-animated (hand-drawn animated) feature film with some computer animation in it\n\n"}

The Dragons were based in San Antonio, Texas and played at the Freeman Coliseum and occasionally the Alamodome.\n\nFor the first month of the 1996–97 season, the Dragons wore temporary white with green trim and logo (home) and black with green and white trim and logo (road) jerseys because the new jerseys had not come in yet. The team folded after two seasons due to financial problems. Although the Iguanas were established, the Dragons drew more fans than the Iguanas and also captured a larger share of the corporate support of San Antonio. Following an overhaul of the front office and following the loss of assistant coach, John Torchetti (former Iguanas head coach), the Dragons in year two of their existence and being the only hockey team in the city floundered and finally went under. Ownership misread the market and finally pulled the plug following poor hockey and business decisions while at odds with the county owned Freeman Coliseum. This allowed the San Antonio Iguanas to reclaim the building lease and start up again. This time of two hockey teams playing in not only the same market, but the same building fractured the hockey fan base for years to come.\n\n"}

The story is presented as text, laid over graphics of the player's current location and other characters who are present. The player progresses through the story and is occasionally presented with decisions that determine the path the game will take.\n\n\"Crescendo\" is told from a third person perspective. This allows the game to shift to other characters' viewpoints from time to time. Most of the game is played from Ryo's point of view, though. \"Crescendo\" is a unique visual novel in that none of the background music used within the game were composed by Yoshio Tsuru for the purpose of the game; instead, it uses various famous songs, pieces, and folk songs (and rearrangements thereof) as its background music, tying the motif of music more closely into the game.\n\nThis game also includes an in-universe nod to characters from an earlier Digital Object game \"\", where the player can watch a movie based on the lives of the characters from that game.\n\nRyo was adopted by the Sasaki family as a baby, much to the delight of his new adoptive sister, Ayame. His new parents chose not to tell him that he was adopted, however, and he didn't discover this fact until his teens. Ryo's life was shortly dealt another blow when his adoptive parents were killed in a car accident. Ayame abandoned her nursing studies in order to get a job and support Ryo through high school. One of the first people Ryo met at high school was Kaho Nagira. She begged him to join the literature club, which was in danger of being closed due to low membership. Surprising even himself, Ryo agreed to join, and he and Kaho became friends. Ryo found it difficult to settle into life at his new school, and sometimes had run-ins with other students. It was in the aftermath of one of these fights that he met the school nurse, Kaori Shito, and the two struck up an unlikely friendship. Throughout his time at high school, Ryo often visited her office in order to take naps and skip class, or simply to talk with her.\n\nIn Ryo's third year of high school, Kyoko Ashihara joined the literature club. She was a first-year student and a friend of Kaho's. Ryo found himself touched by Kyoko's plight—living by herself, apart from both of her parents—and did his best to be kind to her. Ryo has a low opinion of Yuka Otowa. She is looked down upon at the school because she prostitutes herself to other students. However, at the same time, Ryo has found himself defending her to other people and helping her in times of crisis, though he doesn't understand why he bothers. Although Ryo once said he hated Yuka for what she does, his hatred slowly disappears soon after. Tomonori Sugimura is Ryo's best friend at high school. After he met Kaho at the school festival, he asked Ryo to introduce the two of them properly, hoping to develop a relationship with her. Ryo did so, despite his own interest in Kaho. Tomonori and Kaho started dating shortly thereafter. Miyu Shizuhara is a friend of Kaho's who Ryo met when he heard her playing the piano in the music room. Miyu quickly warmed to him, and they soon became friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

I Did It Again\" (2000). It was released on January 15, 2001, by Jive Records as the fourth and final single from the album. After meeting with producer Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange in Switzerland, Spears recorded several songs for the album, including \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\", which she considered one of her favorites on the album. Additional lyrics were written by guitar player Keith Scott and country pop singer Shania Twain. The teen pop ballad speaks of a woman wanting to hear her boyfriend say that he loves her, and is sonically similar to David Bowie and Iggy Pop's song \"China Girl\" (1983).\n\n\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who considered it a good break from the album's genre and praised Spears' vocals, comparing them to those of Twain and Stevie Wonder. The song attained moderate commercial success, reaching number one in Romania, and peaking inside the top ten in Austria, Europe and Switzerland, while reaching top twenty positions in many European countries. \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" was only released for mainstream radio in the United States; therefore, it failed to chart on any major music chart in the country.\n\nAn accompanying music video, directed by Herb Ritts, portrays Spears in love scenes with her on-screen boyfriend, played by French model Brice Durand. The singer's real-life boyfriend at the time Justin Timberlake, however, was said to be annoyed at the kissing scenes, while Spears' mother, Lynne, objected to the explicit sexuality of the original cut of the video. Parts of the video were edited before its release to the public on March 2, 2001. As part of promotion for the song, Spears performed it at \"TRL\", \"Saturday Night Live\", and \"The View\". It has also been included on four of her concert tours. \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" was nominated at Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in the category of \"Best Song\" in 2002. Spears has named \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" one of her favorite songs from her career.\n\nIn 1999, Spears began work on her second studio album, \"Oops!... I Did It Again\" (2000), in Sweden and Switzerland. After meeting with Robert Lange in Switzerland, the singer started to record several songs for the album, including \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\". After finishing the track, Spears revealed in an interview with \"Billboard\" that \"with the first album, I didn't get to show my voice off. The songs were great, but they weren't very challenging. This song is incredible. It's going to surprise people in the best way.\" \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" was written and produced by Robert Lange, while additional lyrics were written by his then-wife Shania Twain and Keith Scott. Spears recorded her vocals for the song between November and December 1999 at Robert Lange's and Shania Twain's chateau in La-Tour-de Peilz, Switzerland, and it was later mixed by Nigel Green and programmed by Cory Churko, Kevin Churko and Richard Meyer. During a live concert at Hawaii, included on her second home video release \"Live and More!\" (2000), Spears said the song is one of her favorites on \"Oops!... I Did It Again\". \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" was released on January 17, 2001 as the final single from the album.\n\n\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" is a pop ballad that lasts for three minutes and 51 seconds. The song is composed in the key of E major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 76 beats per minute, and Spears' vocal range spans from the low-note of F to the high-key of D. A \"NME\" staff reviewer said that the song takes the riff of David Bowie and Iggy Pop's \"China Girl\" (1983) and \"puts it over schmaltzy cocktail-hour bass and love film strings.\" Tom Terrell of MTV, however, compared the riff to the one of A Taste of Honey's cover of \"Sukiyaki\" (1981). Terrell further commented that the \"Eagles-esque chorus\" features \"an '80s hair band power ballad groove\" where \"Britney soul-maxes with a vocal that channels both Stevie Wonder (via \"Knocks Me Off My Feet\") and Shania herself.\"\n\nStephanie McGrath of Jam! said the song is \"a nice break from the 'baby babys', 'yeah yeahs' and insistent drum beats that pepper the other songs\" of Oops!. David Veitch of the \"Calgary Sun\" compared the backing vocals to \"nicely old-fashioned shoo-be-doo-doos\". Lyrically, \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" alludes to how Spears wants to hear her boyfriend say he needs her all the way and that he loves her. Spears considered it a \"pure and delicate\" song. \"It's just one of those songs that pull you in. That's why I like it, and I like singing it as well\", she continued. \"I think they wrote it 'specially for me, because the lyrics of the song, if you really listen... they're more of what I can relate to, 'cause they're kind of young lyrics, I think. I don't think Shania would probably sing some of the words that I'm saying.\"\n\n\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" received mostly positive reviews from contemporary critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic deemed it \"sweetly sentimental\" and akin to the other ballads on \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", while a Rhapsody review considered them \"perfectly constructed ballads\". Stephanie McGrath of Jam! called the song \"the best showcase of Spears' talents\". A \"NME\" staff reviewer considered the track \"absolutely frightening\", with Tracy E. Hopkins of \"Barnes & Noble\" deeming \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" a \"polished ballad\", and praising Shania Twain for the songwriting. \"Billboard\" journalist Michael Paoletta noted that Spears may not have the vocal range of \"colleagues Jessica Simpson and Christina Aguilera, but she does have an instantly recognizable style-and Oops!... indicates that she's developing a soulful edge and emotional depth that can't be conjured with a glass-shattering note\", further commenting that this can be confirmed \"on the hitworthy, Shania Twain-penned ballad 'Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know'\". \n\nWhile reviewing 2011's Femme Fatale Tour, Jocelyn Vena of MTV considered the song, along with \"Toxic\", \"old-school jams\". \"Bustle\"s Alex Kristelis highlighted its \"epic\" chorus while the staff from \"Entertainment Weekly\" called it \"a pretty mid tempo melody\", and placed it at number 84 on their ranking of Spears' songs. Nayer Nissim from \"Pink News\", said that \"it's not that Britney can’t do slow tracks, but her vocals don’t always have the energy to push them\", citing \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" as an example. Nicholas Hautman, from \"Us Weekly\", concluded that \"Spears showcases her soulful, unwavering vocals on this well-executed ballad\". \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" was nominated at Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in the category of \"Best Song\" in 2002.\n\n\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" was not commercially available in the United States, and was sent only to mainstream radio on April 2, 2001. Therefore, the track failed to appear on any major music chart in the United States. However, \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" was successful in Europe, debuting and peaking at number nine on the European Hot 100 Singles on the chart issue dated April 14, 2001. The song was also able to reach the top ten in Austria and Switzerland, while attaining top 20 positions in Belgium (Flanders), Finland, Ireland, Norway and Sweden. In the United Kingdom, it debuted and peaked at number 12 on April 7, 2001, exiting the UK Singles Chart after eight weeks. \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" achieved commercial success in Romania, where it reached number one and was the third best-selling single of 2001. The song also reached number one in Mexico and was the sixth best-selling single of 2001. Despite reaching number 14 in Denmark, the song was later certified Gold by International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), for shipping over 5,000 units of the single in the county. The single was not released in Australia; instead, it was included as a bonus second disc of the limited edition of \"Oops!... I Did It Again\" released in the country.\n\nThe music video for \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" was directed by the American photographer Herb Ritts, and shot at Key Biscayne in Miami, Florida in the last week of January 2001. Spears revealed she was inspired by Janet Jackson's video for \"Love Will Never Do (Without You)\"(1990) to select Ritts as the video's director. According to Ritts, the singer \"wanted to do something fresh. There was one outfit, no dancing, and that meant that it boiled down to her. She really had to act the song, and she was very impressive.\" He also revealed that the video was set at \"a funky beach shack\" similar to the videos for Madonna's \"Cherish\" and Chris Isaak's \"Wicked Game\" (1989). \"The story is, pretty much, Britney longing for him to tell her the words\", said Ritts, who was impressed with the chemistry between the singer and her on-screen boyfriend, played by French model Brice Durand. Spears' real-life boyfriend at the time Justin Timberlake, however, \"was said to be miffed at Spears' kissing scenes with French model\", according to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV. Spears mother, Lynne, also criticized considered the original music video for being too racy at the time, because it contained sexually explicit material. Parts of the video were edited before its release to the public.\n\nThe music video debuted at number one on MTV's \"TRL\" on March 2, 2001. The video begins with Spears and her boyfriend in a hammock. Cuts of her cuddling with her love interest beside a fire are also included. We also see her and her boyfriend on the seashore doing a love scene. Inside a tiki hut, Spears exclaims the words she wants her boyfriend to know. In the second half of the video, she is seen on a tree where her boyfriend reaches for her. There are also scenes where she is running on the beach and her boyfriend is chasing after her. Spears wears only a bikini top and a pair of cutoff shorts during the whole video, going barefoot throughout. The music video was considered by Spears as \"the funnest [\"sic\"] video I've ever done.\" An alternate footage of the video can be found on the DVD of Spears first compilation album \"\". Vineyard considered the footage as the one that \"makes the most use of Britney's body of work, with the spaceman from \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", an opening door from \"My Prerogative\" and one love interest from \"Toxic\" all making cameos\".\n\nThe first performance of \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" was on March 8, 2000, during the Crazy 2k Tour in Pensacola, Florida, where Spears appeared onstage sitting on a magic carpet and flew over the audience while singing the song. After releasing her second studio album, \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", Spears performed the song on the American music show \"TRL\", on \"Saturday Night Live\" and on \"The View\". She also performed the song live on 2000s Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour. After performing \"Sometimes\", she climbed the staircase and briefly spoke to the audience before moving into the performance of the song, for which she wore a long white dress trimmed with boa feathers. \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" was performed also on the Dream Within a Dream Tour in 2001 and 2002. The performance consisted of Spears singing the song on an elevated platform wearing an evening gown with artificial snow falling from the ceiling, while two of her dancers performed a routine.\n\nAlmost ten years later, \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" was performed by Spears on 2011's Femme Fatale Tour. The performance consists of Spears sitting on a swing singing the song, whilst a male dancer dances beneath her, at one point attaching himself by his feet to the swing whilst midair. Shirley Halperin of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" named it one of the best performances of the show along with \"Piece of Me\" and \"3\", stating that \"ironically enough, [they] were the ones with fewest frills.\" In a review of the special broadcast by American premium television channel Epix of the tour, Jocelyn Vena of MTV summarized her thoughts about the performance saying, \"It's rare these days to see Britney Spears show her soft side, but she takes a break from the nonstop, fist-pumping music during the spectacle that is the Femme Fatale Tour and kicks it old-school, showing us she still has the heart and soul to bust out a power ballad.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits for \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" adapted from \"Oops!...

{"id": "1941520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941520", "title": "Daddy (Korn song)", "text": "Daddy (Korn song)\n\n\"Daddy\" is a song recorded and performed by American nu metal band Korn for their self-titled debut album (1994). It is the album's 12th and final track.\n\nThe song originated in Jonathan Davis's former band Sexart. The original concept came from Sexart member Dennis Shinn. As Shinn stated: \"The song took on 2 lives. 1st being titled \"Follow Me\" as it was written and performed in our band we had together called Sexart. The song changed form when it was re-produced by Korn. The first version of the song is lyrically portrayed from an older person's perspective, who is about to rape the mind of an \"Innocent Child\" sexually (being referenced as a virgin not an actual child metaphorically speaking). As the song focused more on the creepy element being their first sexual experience. The song carried a dark feel, both musically, and in lyrics. This is probably how, and exactly why Jonathan was able to channel a dark moment from his past when he was in the process of re-producing the song with Korn. Jonathan also gave the song a new title, \"Daddy\".\n\nThe band's singer, Jonathan Davis, has stated that the song is about a painful experience of being molested as a child and not being believed. However, he denied it was about physical or sexual abuse at the hands of his father, and the title and some concepts within the song stem from his parents not believing him. The song caused many to assume that Jonathan's father Rick Davis had molested his son. It is a source of embarrassment for Rick, though his son has gone on the record in many interviews saying it was actually written about a family friend. Jonathan and Rick both decided not to say who the person was.\n\nIn an early \"Kerrang!\" magazine interview, Davis commented on the song:\n\nIn an interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Davis stated that he is comfortable performing the song now. Davis has also uploaded a video discussing the song to YouTube. In the video, he said that the abuser was his babysitter; who had since died.\n\nThe song eventually leads to Davis being stranded in a room, and shouting hostile things presumably to the abuser, which then leads to Davis weeping for a long period of time as a lullaby by vocalist Judith Kiener is heard. The band continues on playing an instrumental version until eventually a door is heard shutting. The rest of the band did not know that the song was about Davis' childhood prior to recording.\n\nAfter about five minutes of silence at the end of the song, a discussion can be heard; a random audio clip that producer Ross Robinson found inside an abandoned house. The argument revolves around a man named Michael and a woman named Geri conversing about the installation of a car part (apparently an exhaust manifold on a Dodge Dart). Michael can be heard yelling at Geri over the merits of the installation. This hidden track is called \"Michael & Geri\".\n\nThe song is notable for, despite its popularity among fans, never being played live after the album version was recorded; an earlier version of the song was performed at each of their first three shows. Jonathan Davis says that the song is simply too personal for him to perform live.\n\nOccasionally, an instrumental excerpt of the song would be used as an introduction to \"Shoots and Ladders\" during early live performances.\n\nIn an interview, Davis discussed how prior to Korn's Back 2 Basics Tour in 2003 with Limp Bizkit, the band allowed fans to vote on which songs would be in the setlist for that tour. \"Daddy\" topped the list, but he declined to have it on the setlist because of its emotional atmosphere.\n\n\"I don't play that song live because it's just magic,\" Davis said. \"If I play that song over and over every night, it'd lose its meaning. I don't want people to expect me to freak out like I did on that. That was what happened in that point in time, and that magic was captured, and I don't want to fuck with it.\"\n\nKorn announced they were going to play their self-titled album in full on tours to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the album, including playing \"Daddy; however, the band later stated they will only be playing their debut album in full at festivals, hence not playing \"Daddy\" on the Prepare for Hell tour with Slipknot and King 810.\n\nKorn performed \"Daddy\" for the first time in nearly twenty years at the Brooklyn Bowl in Las Vegas on March 13, 2015.\n\nOn March 17, 2015 Korn played the Pot O' Gold festival at Tempe Beach Park, Tempe Arizona. During this performance Korn played their first album in its entirety, including \"Daddy\", to celebrate 20 years of Korn.\n\n\"Daddy\" was played at Hellfest in Clisson, France in June 2015.\n\nThe song was also performed for the band's 20th anniversary tour.\n\nThe demo version of the song, which is found on \"Neidermeyer's Mind\", is shorter than the album version. While the album version is 9:32 in length, the demo version is 4:29 in length. The demo does not feature the a cappella intro; it starts immediately with Fieldy's bass riff. It also has a different chorus. After the instrumental bridge, there is an extra part to the song with Jonathan Davis singing: \"Mommy! Why did Daddy touch me there?\" which leads into \"I didn't touch you there.\"\n\n"}

His younger sisters are Pat, Barbara, Penny, and Faye. For a time, the family resided on East 79th Street near railroad tracks.\n\nRichard graduated from high school and moved to Chicago and eventually to California.\n\nHe took tennis lessons from a man known as \"Old Whiskey\" and decided his future daughters would be tennis professionals when he saw Virginia Ruzici playing on television. Williams says that he wrote up a 78-page plan, and started giving lessons to Venus and Serena when they were four and a half, and began taking them to the public tennis courts. (He now says he feels like he took them too early, and six is a better age.) Soon he got them into Shreveport tennis tournaments. In 1995, Williams pulled them out of a tennis academy, and coached them himself.\n\nSerena won the US Open in 1999; Venus beat Lindsay Davenport to win the 2000 Wimbledon title. After that victory, Richard shouted \"Straight Outta Compton!\" (in reference to a song by N.W.A based in Compton, California, the same area in Los Angeles where the family once resided). He jumped over the NBC broadcasting booth, catching Chris Evert by surprise and performing a triumphant dance. Evert said that the broadcasters \"thought the roof was coming down\".\n\nWilliams has been married multiple times. After moving to California, he met Betty Johnson. They married in 1965 and had five children (three sons and two daughters) before divorcing in 1973: Sabrina, Richard III, Ronner, Reluss, and Reneeka, who were also raised with maternal half-sister Katrina.\n\nIn 1979, he met Oracene \"Brandy\" Price, who had three daughters by her deceased husband. They married in 1980. Williams and Price had two biological daughters, Venus (born June 17, 1980) and Serena (born September 26, 1981). The family resided in Compton, California. Richard and Oracene divorced in 2002. \n\nRichard has a number of other children, including Chavoita LeSane. One adult son appeared courtside in 2011.\n\nLater in his daughters' careers, he took a less visible role, turning to other interests such as photography. He raised public interest again after his divorce from Oracene Price and appearances with new girlfriend Lakeisha Juanita Graham who was a grocery store owner and is a year older than Venus. Richard and Lakeisha were married in 2010 and divorced in 2017. Their son Dylan was born in 2012.\n\nIn July 2016, Williams suffered a stroke. Lakeisha Williams, his wife at the time, stated that his condition was fair. He subsequently suffered additional strokes.\n\n\n"}

After formal education in philosophy and mathematics at Stanford and Harvard, Wolff devoted himself to the goal of transcending the normal limits of human consciousness. After exploring various mystical teachings and paths, he dedicated himself to the path of jnana yoga and the writings of Shankara, the expounder of the Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy.\n\nFranklin Fowler Wolff was born in Pasadena, California in 1887. He was raised as a Methodist, but abandoned Christianity during his youth. Wolff studied mathematics and philosophy at Stanford and Harvard. At Stanford, he was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society in 1911. He briefly taught mathematics at Stanford in 1914, but left academia the following year. In 1920, Wolff married Sarah Merrell Briggs. The couple joined their original surnames; hence Wolff became Franklin Merrell-Wolff. Merrell-Wolff and his wife founded an esoteric group called the \"Assembly of Man\" in 1928, which congregated in an ashram in the Sierra Nevada mountains near Mount Whitney. Sarah Merrell-Wolff, also known as Sherifa, died in 1959. Franklin Merrell-Wolff remarried and lived the rest of his life in the mountains until his death in 1985. He authored various books and a great number of recorded lectures explaining his philosophy. \n\nWolff's philosophy was described by religious scholar Arthur Versluis as a \"consistent and extensive body of work with a unique vocabulary and set of concepts\". In his works, Wolff described his mystic experiences and their implications, examining his experience in the light of his extensive knowledge of mathematics and philosophy. Although he started an Ashram, his form of spirituality was not necessarily compatible with a religious structure. \n\nIn his book \"Pathways Through to Space\", Wolff describes having a profound spiritual realization in 1936, which provided the basis for his transcendental philosophy. He called this experience the \"Fundamental Realization\". In its aftermath, Wolff found himself being in a state of euphoric consciousness he called the \"Current of Ambrosia\", which he described as being \"above time, space and causality\". It also led Wolff to a state of \"High Indifference\", or consciousness without an object. At the center of these experiences was the realization of \"Primordial consciousness\", which, according to Wolff, is beyond and prior to the subject or the object and is unaffected by their presence or absence. \n\nOne of his fundamental contributions to epistemology was the notion of \"Introception\", or \"Knowledge through Identity\". This represents a transcendent form of knowledge which is neither conceptual nor empirical. It is perhaps the simplest and clearest definition ever proposed, of what many mystics have called \"Gnosis\". \n\nWolff's other published books detailing his experience and philosophy include \"The Philosophy of Consciousness Without an Object\" and \"Transformations in Consciousness: The Metaphysics and Epistemology\" (originally published under the title \"Introceptualism\").\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1941545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941545", "title": "Vertical stabilizer", "text": "Vertical stabilizer\n\nA vertical stabilizer, vertical stabiliser, or fin of an aircraft, missile, bomb, or car are typically found on the aft end of the fuselage or body, and are intended to reduce aerodynamic side slip and provide direction stability. It is analogous to a skeg on boats and ships.\n\nOn aircraft, vertical stabilizers generally point upwards. These are also known as the vertical tail, and are part of an aircraft's empennage. This upright mounting position has two major benefits: The drag of the stabilizer increases at speed, which creates a nose-up moment that helps to slow down the aircraft and prevent dangerous overspeed; and when the aircraft banks, the stabilizer produces lift which counters the banking moment and keeps the aircraft upright in the absence of control input. If the vertical stabilizer was mounted on the underside, it would produce a positive feedback whenever the aircraft dives or banks, which is inherently unstable. The trailing end of the stabilizer is typically movable, and called the rudder; this allows the aircraft pilot to control yaw.\n\nOften navigational radio or airband transceiver antennas are placed on or inside the vertical tail. In all known trijets (jet aircraft with three engines), the vertical stabilizer houses the central engine or engine inlet duct.\n\nA few aircraft models have a ventral fin under the rear end. Normally this is small, or can fold sideways, to allow landing. Both the North American X-15 supersonic/hypersonic experimental aircraft, and the late World War II German twin-engined Dornier Do 335 heavy fighter used differing forms of the cruciform tail stabilizing surface format.\n\nVertical stabilizers have also been used in automobiles, specifically in top-level motor sports, with the concept making a resurgence in both Formula 1 and Le Mans Prototype racing.\n\nThe vertical stabilizer is mounted exactly vertically, and the horizontal stabilizer is directly mounted to the empennage (the rear fuselage). This is the most common vertical stabilizer configuration.\n\nA T-tail has the horizontal stabilizer mounted at the top of the vertical stabilizer. It is commonly seen on rear-engine aircraft, such as the Bombardier CRJ200, the Fokker 70, the Boeing 727, the Vickers VC10 and Douglas DC-9, and most high-performance gliders.\n\nT-tails are often incorporated on configurations with fuselage mounted engines to keep the horizontal stabilizer away from the engine exhaust plume.\n\nT-tail aircraft are more susceptible to pitch-up at high angles of attack. This pitch-up results from a reduction in the horizontal stabilizer's lifting capability as it passes through the wake of the wing at moderate angles of attack. This can also result in a deep stall condition.\n\nT-tails present structural challenges since loads on the horizontal stabilizer must be transmitted through the vertical tail.\n\nThe cruciform tail is arranged like a cross, the most common configuration having the horizontal stabilizer intersecting the vertical tail somewhere near the middle. The PBY Catalina uses this configuration. The \"push-pull\" twin engined Dornier Do 335 World War II German fighter used a cruciform tail consisting of four separate surfaces, arranged in dorsal, ventral, and both horizontal locations, to form its cruciform tail, just forward of the rear propeller.\n\nThe Dassault Falcon is known for its cruciform tail.\n\nRather than a single vertical stabilizer, a twin tail aircraft has two. These are vertically arranged, and intersect or are mounted to the ends of the horizontal stabilizer. The Beechcraft Model 18 and many modern military aircraft such as the American F-14, F-15, and F/A-18 use this configuration. The F/A-18, F-22 Raptor, and F-35 Lightning II have tailfins that are canted outward, to the point that they have some authority as horizontal control surfaces; both aircraft are designed to deflect their rudders inward during takeoff to increase pitching moment. A twin tail may be either H-tail, twin fin/rudder construction attached to a single fuselage such as North American B-25 Mitchell or Avro Lancaster, or twin boom tail, the rear airframe consisting of two separate fuselages each sporting one single fin/rudder, such as Lockheed P-38 Lightning or C-119 Boxcar.\n\nA variation on the twin tail, it has three vertical stabilizers. An example of this configuration is the Lockheed Constellation. On the Constellation it was done to give the airplane maximum vertical stabilizer area while keeping the overall height low enough so that it could fit into maintenance hangars.\n\nA V-tail has no distinct vertical or horizontal stabilizers. Rather, they are merged into control surfaces known as ruddervators which control both pitch and yaw. The arrangement looks like the letter V, and is also known as a \"butterfly tail\". The Beechcraft Bonanza Model 35 uses this configuration, as does the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, Northrop YF-23, and many of Richard Schreder's HP series of homebuilt gliders.\n\nWinglets served double duty on Burt Rutan's canard pusher configuration VariEze and Long-EZ, acting as both a wingtip device and a vertical stabilizer. Several other derivatives of these and other similar aircraft use this design element.\n\nVertical stabilizers are also known as \"fins\".\n\nThe vertical stabilizer often employs a small fillet or \"dorsal fin\" at its forward base which helps to increase the stall angle of the vertical surface (thanks to vortex lift) and to prevent a phenomenon called rudder lock or rudder reversal. Rudder lock occurs when the force on a deflected rudder (in a steady sideslip) suddenly reverses as the vertical stabilizer stalls. This may leave the rudder stuck at full deflection with the pilot unable to recenter it.\n\nThe dorsal fin was introduced in the 1940s, like for the 1942 Douglas DC-4, predating the wing strakes of the 1970s fighter prototypes like the YF-16 (developed into the F16) or YF-17 (developed into the F18).\n\nWhile vertical stabilizers have also been used in some race cars, such as the 1955 Jaguar D-type, the concept has seen sparing use until recently. It has seen a resurgence in Formula 1 and Le Mans endurance racing, where it is sometimes referred to as a \"shark fin\". Its primary purpose is to reduce sudden high-speed yaw-induced blow-overs that would cause cars to flip due to lift when subject to extreme yaw angles during cornering or in a spin. Since 2011, the vertical stabilizer has become mandatory for all newly homologated Le Mans Prototypes.\n\nSome Formula 1 teams utilized a vertical stabilizer as a way to disrupt the airflow to the rear wing reducing drag, the most radical system being the \"F-duct\" found in the McLaren MP4-25 (and later copied by Ferrari in the Ferrari F10). On demand by the driver, this system diverted air from a duct in the front of the car through a tunnel in the vertical fin onto the rear wing to stall it and reduce drag on the straights on which downforce wasn't needed. The system was banned for the 2011 Formula 1 season, with vertical stabilizers altogether being replaced with vestigial strakes for the 2018 season.\n\n"}

Keyboards, guitars, and drums are the main instruments used. As with all Fiery Furnaces releases, Eleanor Friedberger provides most of the vocals, with her brother Matt adding to a few songs. Matt is considered the main instrumentalist for the band, while both Friedbergers share lyrical duties. The album is more structurally complex than the band's debut, \"Gallowsbird's Bark\", and most of the songs have distinct movements that sound like multiple songs combined.\n\nThe song \"Straight Street\" references the biblical \"street called straight\" in Damascus. \"1917\" features references to the 1917 World Series, the most recent series that the Chicago White Sox had won at the point this album was released.\n\n\"Blueberry Boat\" garnered polarized but generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 70, which indicates \"generally positive reviews\", based on 34 reviews.

It is on the Northampton Loop of the West Coast Main Line. The station is served by West Midlands Trains services southbound to London Euston and northbound to Birmingham New Street and Crewe. A handful of Avanti West Coast services also serve the station.\n\nUntil 18 April 1966, the station was known as \"Northampton Castle\", as it is built on the site of the former castle of that name. As part of the station's redevelopment in 2015, it was proposed to revert to this name. However, that did not happen.\n\nThe station has toilets, a newsagent, coffee shops, and a car hire office. As part of the re-development in 2015 there were proposals to build a multi-storey car park with direct access to the station.\n\nNorthampton is served by West Midlands Trains services to London Euston and Birmingham New Street. WMT maintain their fleet of Class 350 EMUs at the Siemens depot just to the north of the station, as well as maintaining a Train Crew Depot at the station.\n\nThe typical Monday-Saturday off-peak service consists of:\n\n\n\nThe service along the Trent Valley Line to via and no longer calls here (since December 2012); this service now runs on the direct (fast) lines between Milton Keynes Central and Rugby arising from the London Midland decision to run 110 mph regional services on the West Coast Main Line. Passengers wishing to travel from Northampton to Crewe now have to change at Rugby. However, there are still six Crewe services on Mondays to Fridays (Three in the mornings, three in the evenings), three on Saturdays (In the morning only) and an hourly service on Sundays.\nAvanti West Coast operate two trains per day to London Euston (southbound only); one in the early morning and one in the late evening. These services originate from Rugby or Wolverhampton. However no northbound Avanti West Coast services are timetabled as serving Northampton. The lack of fast services at Northampton is caused by the town being bypassed by the fast lines of the West Coast Main Line (which follow the original route of the London and Birmingham Railway). Connections to Manchester and other long-distance destinations can be made by changing at Milton Keynes Central.\n\nAt one time there were three railway stations in Northampton: \"Northampton (Bridge Street)\", \"Northampton (St. John's Street)\" and \"Northampton (Castle)\", only the last of which now survives as the town's only station.\n\nAlthough the promoters of the London and Birmingham Railway had considered routes passing close to Northampton in 1830, the town was skirted by the final choice of alignment via and a loop line to remedy this had to wait for several decades. The decision to omit Northampton was not due to local opposition but rather engineering decisions taken by the railway company's engineer Robert Stephenson. The difference in gradient in the between Northampton and Blisworth, on the floor of the Nene Valley, is likely to have played a key role in the decision. Robert Stephenson is reported to have said that he could easily get trains into the town but not out again. As a result, Northampton lost out as a commercial centre to towns such as Leicester which had better transport links. The town was considered as the southern terminus of the Midland Counties Railway in 1833 but lost out to on account of the shorter distance with Leicester.\n\nBridge Street station on the Northampton and Peterborough Railway from to was thus the first station in Northampton, opening on 13 May 1845.\n\nFollowing the discovery of a large quantity of ironstone in Northamptonshire in 1851, a proposal was made by the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR) for an line from Market Harborough to Northampton which received Parliamentary approval in 1853. The line's terminus in Northampton was to be on part of the old orchard of Northampton Castle which had been purchased in 1852 by the Reverend Havilland de Sausmarez, the absentee Rector of the Parish of St Peter, as the site of a new rectory. The L&NWR agreed to purchase the land for £5,250, to complete the parsonage and to rent it back to the Reverend. Tenders were advertised for the line in 1858 and the lowest offer of £81,637 by Richard Dunkley of Blisworth was accepted. The contractor had been an unsuccessful bidder for the contract to build Bridge Street station. Dunkley was also the successful tenderer for the line's stations, including Castle station at a cost of £612.\n\nIt would be the most basic structure on the line with no goods facilities, limited passenger waiting accommodation and an awning over the single platform. Goods traffic was to be dealt with at Bridge Street. The station opened with the line on 16 February 1859. It was described in the L&NWR's minutes as a \"very unassuming edifice\", giving the impression that it was \"merely temporary in nature\" until traffic developed to a sufficient level to allow a \"more imposing\" structure to be built.\n\nThe advent of the Great Northern and London and North Western Joint Railway to tap the coalfields of Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire led the L&NWR to quadruple its main line between and Rugby and also to consider ways in which Northampton might be better served. In 1875, the L&NWR obtained powers to quadruple the main line north from Bletchley to , with the two new tracks (the \"slow lines\") diverging at Roade so as to form a new line (the \"Northampton Loop\") through Northampton. The result of these works would be to put Northampton on an important coal artery from Nottingham and the North to the L&NWR's Camden goods depot.\n\nAdditional land would have to be purchased at Castle station to allow for expanded passenger facilities and goods facilities. Owing to the proximity of the River Nene, the only way this could be done was to expand onto the site of Northampton Castle. On 18 December 1876, the L&NWR purchased the site from William Walker and subsequently demolished the remains of the castle except for the postern gate which, following a local petition, was moved to a new site in the boundary wall of the new station where it remains to this day. £30,000 was allowed by the L&NWR board for the improvement of passenger facilities and a goods shed was constructed on the site of the castle in 1880. The rebuilt station opened with the Loop Line north to on 1 December 1881 followed by the line south to Roade on 3 April 1882. It comprised three through platforms and five terminal bays. Platform 1, which was sited on the east side of the running lines, was considered as the main up platform; it had two adjoining bay platforms, numbered 2 and 3. Platforms 4 and 5 were located at the south end of platform 1, while the two sides of an island platform on the down side of the station were platforms 6 and 7. A further down bay platform was situated at the north end of platform 6, along with other bays and loading docks for parcels and sundries traffic.\n\nThe main station building, a two-storey structure in the Italianate style, was located on the up side and consisted of a central block with two cross-wings. The wings had gable roofs, whereas the central part had a low-pitched hipped roof. Two standard L&NWR signal cabins were positioned to the north and south of the platforms, these being known respectively as Northampton No. 1 and No. 2 boxes. Other signal cabins, Northampton No. 3 and No. 4, were sited further north and controlled extensive marshalling yards. A fifth cabin at Duston West Junction lay to the south-west; it controlled the apex of the Northampton triangle. No. 2 was the largest signal cabin with 118 levers which controlled the country end of the station, access to the goods shed and the south end of the goods yard.\n\nNo further significant changes took place prior to nationalisation except for an increase in the number of sidings at the station. One notable change was the traffic diverted from Northampton St John's following its closure in 1939.\n\nClosures accelerated under British Railways with the withdrawal of services from Bridge Street station, which lost much if not all of its significance following the opening of the Loop, on 4 May 1964 when the Northampton to Peterborough line was closed, leaving only Castle station serving the town. As a result, Castle station was renamed \"Northampton\" on 18 April 1966. In addition, the bay platforms 4 and 5 were removed and the area converted into an overflow car park. The Great Northern and London and North Western Joint Line closed to all passenger traffic except for a workmen's service on 7 December 1953; the workmen's service between Market Harborough and East Norton ended on 20 May 1957. The section between Welham Junction and Marefield North Junction closed on November 1963, followed by the Rugby and Stamford Railway on 6 June 1966. The line to Market Harborough closed on 15 August 1981.\n\nThe station was chosen by British Rail for complete rebuilding in 1965–66 to designs by the architect Ray Moorcroft, as part of the electrification of the West Coast Main Line between and Liverpool. The Victorian station was demolished to be replaced by new structures which were described as \"three cowsheds bolted together\" and as being of \"questionable architectural merit\". The station layout remained unchanged: three long through platforms and a number of terminal bays. Standard colour-light signalling was installed in the area but control was not centralised. The current was switched on for the first time between Hillmorton Junction to Northampton on 6 June 1965 for insulation tests, with steam locomotives being withdrawn from the area on 27 September 1965.\n\nBy the late 2000s, the station had become inadequate for the size of the town which it served and the 2.5 million passengers who used it each year. Following the designation of Northampton Waterside as an enterprise zone in August 2011, plans to replace the existing station with a new two-storey glass and steel structure were approved by the West Northamptonshire Development Corporation.\n\nThe redevelopment included a new station building nearly twice the size of the existing one, a new 1,270 space multi-storey car park, new footbridge and platform canopies, new approach roads and associated junction improvements, as well as a commercial development. Funding for the new station was agreed in May 2012 when the coalition government agreed to provide £10m, with the remaining £10m coming from Network Rail and Northamptonshire County Council. Construction work began in August 2013. The new station opened on 12 January 2015. This was followed by demolition of the old station and construction of a new station building. It is planned to build a new 1550 space multi-storey car park, with direct access to the booking hall, this is being developed by Northampton Borough Council and Network Rail as part of a wider proposal to develop the surrounding land for housing and commercial use.\n\nNorthamptonshire County Council wanted to rename the station \"Northampton Castle\" in recognition of the site's history. The change, reported to cost £200,000, looked unlikely to go ahead as of November 2015.\n\nThe 2005 film \"Kinky Boots\" featured a station named 'Northampton', although the scenes were filmed at nearby Wellingborough on the Midland Main Line.\n\nFor several years after 1849 engines were stabled in the open on a siding set aside for this purpose. The first shed was a wooden structure opened in by the London and Birmingham Railway which was blown down in 1852. A brick built replacement was provided in 1855 which was later enlarged in 1870 to receive extra locomotives from shed which closed in 1874. In 1881, a large 10-road replacement shed was constructed in the triangle of lines to the south of the station, with the 1855 shed subsequently used for carriage storage. This shed, which was often referred to as \"Bridge Street\", was located near the Grand Union Canal and could accommodate 50 engines. Measuring with a turntable, the shed was initially coded as No. 5 and became No. 6 on the opening of Bescot. For administrative purposes, it was merged with Colwick shed upon the grouping and both remained under the control of the same shed foreman until Colwick's closure in 1932. Northampton was coded 2C in 1935 when it was merged with Rugby shed; it remained 2C until December 1963 when it was recoded 1H by British Railways.\n\nInitially 16 locomotives were allocated to Northampton shed in the 1860s, a figure which had risen to 36 by 1925 despite receiving the allocation of the ex-Midland shed at Hardingstone Lane in 1924. The stock level rose under British Railways when it comprised 8Fs, 4Fs and LNWR 0-8-0s for freight workings, 'Black Fives', 2-6-2Ts and 4-4-0s for passenger services, while a few 3Fs and a single Webb 2-4-2T were used for shunting.\n\nA re-arrangement of the offices and stores took place in 1927 under the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at a cost of nearly £1,000; the roof was also replaced by one with a 'louvre' pattern. A new turntable was installed in 1938 by the south-east corner of the building. Further modernisation took place in 1952 when ash and coaling plants were erected by British Railways, together with a new structure. The shed was closed, along with Willesden shed, as from 27 September 1965, a consequence of the electrification of the West Coast Main Line.\n\nTo the north of the station is a five-road Siemens rolling stock maintenance depot which officially opened on 27 June 2006; the depot is responsible for West Midland Train's entire Class 350 Desiro fleet which were introduced in June 2005.\n\n\n"}

It was not until he was enticed to write the music for the existing libretto of what became \"Nabucco\" that Verdi restarted his career.\n\nAfter \"Oberto\" and after Merelli returned from Vienna in early 1840, he needed a comedy to be written for the autumn season. Asked to select a libretto by Romani which already existed, Verdi notes that he did not like any of them but \"because the matter was of some urgency, I chose the one which seemed to me to be the least bad\".\n\nThe first performance at La Scala on 5 September 1840 was a failure, and La Scala cancelled the remaining scheduled performances. They did not revive the work until 2001. Verdi would not attempt another operatic comedy until the end of his career with \"Falstaff\".\n\nAt the premiere Verdi was seated in the orchestra pit, and thus heard the audience reaction directly. Along with the critics, Verdi acknowledged that the failure was partly due to his own personal circumstances, since his two children (the first in 1838, the second in 1839) and then, in June 1840, his wife Margherita Barezzi had died, all during the period leading up to and during its composition. A contributing factor was that the only singers La Scala's impresario had available were those assembled for an opera seria, Otto Nicolai's \"Il templario\", and they had no experience with comedy: \"The cast had been assembled chiefly for the performance of the season's most successful novelty, \"Il templario\", Nicolai's version of Ivanhoe\". Other factors which have been noted include the large size of La Scala itself (noted by George Martin as \"too big for the piece\") plus the rather old-fashioned nature of the work which was written in a style that was rapidly going out of fashion. In fact, in summary, Budden notes that \"by the side of Donizetti's \"L'elisir d'amore\" or \"Don Pasquale\", it cuts a clumsy figure\".\n\nOther productions in Italy during Verdi's lifetime seemed to fare better; it was given in Venice in 1845 (as \"Il finto Stanislao\", where it did well), in Rome in 1846, and Naples (also as \"Il finto Stanislao\") in 1859.\n\nIn the U.S., the opera received its premiere on 18 June 1960, while in the UK, the premiere took place on 21 March 1961. It was part of the San Diego Opera's June 1981 \"Verdi Festival\".\n\nWith the temporary shutdown of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in 1999, the Royal Opera gave a concert performance at the Royal Festival Hall. Russian baritone Vladimir Chernov sang the \"King\" with John Del Carlo as Baron Kelbar; Susanne Mentzer sang Giuletta. This presentation was followed in 2001 with a staged production at the Buxton Festival in England.\n\nIn October 2012, the Bilbao-based ABAO society, one which plans to present all of Verdi's works, presented the opera under conductor Alberto Zedda.\n\nSarasota Opera presented the new critical edition of the opera in March 2013, the 29th work of the complete Verdi canon (in all its versions) to be presented by the company. Dr. Francesco Izzo, Co-Director of the American Institute for Verdi Studies and the critical edition's editor, notes that:\nThis edition corrects a number of inaccuracies and arbitrary alterations present in other scores of the opera, which has often circulated under the title \"Il finto Stanislao\". I have done my very best to provide an edition that faithfully reflects Verdi's intentions throughout.\n\nThe Glimmerglass Festival presented the opera in a new English adaptation during the 2013 Festival.\n\nThe Polish monarch, King Stanisław Leszczyński, an historical figure during the War of Succession, lost his throne after the Saxon invasion at the Battle of Poltava in 1709. He regained it in 1733, but was again deposed in 1736 and went into exile in France. The opera is set in 1733 when Stanislaw returned to Poland leaving a French officer, the Cavaliere di Belfiore, to impersonate him in France.\n\n\"Scene 1: A gallery in the home of Baron Kelbar\" \n\nBelfiore, impersonating the Polish king Stanislaus, is a guest at the home of Baron Kelbar and he comments to himself on his change of fortune: \"Compagnoni di Parigi...Verrà purtroppo il giorno\" / \"Comrades in Paris...Unfortunately, the day will come\". The Baron has recently arranged a political alliance by betrothing his daughter, Giulietta, to La Rocca, the Brittany Treasurer, but Giulietta prefers La Rocca's nephew, Edoardo. Another undesired marriage involves Baron Kelbar's niece, the Marchesa del Poggio, a young widow who is in love with Belfiore. She has become engaged to the Count of Ivrea because Belfiore has been unable to commit himself to marrying her, in spite of the fact that he does love her.\n\nKnowing of the Marchesa's imminent arrival and concerned that she might reveal his false identity as the King, Belfiore writes to Stanislaw and asks to be released from his commitment. Edoardo reveals his predicament to the \"King\" and begs to be taken to Poland with him in order to forget about the woman he loves. In addition, when the Marchesa arrives and, upon being introduced to Belfiore as \"the King\", she pretends not to recognize him. Likewise, he pretends not to recognize her, but she is determined to test him by proclaiming her love for the Count: \"Grave a core innamorato...Se dee cader la vedova\".\n\n\"Scene 2: The Garden of Kelbar's castle\"\n\nGiulietta is alone with her attendants and expresses unhappiness in having to marry an old man: \"Non san quant'io nel petto...Non vo' quel vecchio\". When Baron Kelbar and Treasurer La Rocca arrive, followed in succession by Belfiore and Edoardo and then the Marchesa (who was planning to help the lovers), Belfiore draws the Baron and Treasurer La Rocca away on the pretext of discussing state business, leaving the young lovers alone with the Marchesa.\n\n\"Scene 3: The gallery of Kelbar's castle\"\n\nMaintaining his role as the King, Belfiore makes the Treasurer an offer of advancement which would include marriage to a rich widow. By accepting, he agrees not to marry Giulietta. When the Treasurer tells Baron Kelbar that he refuses to marry his daughter, the Baron is affronted and challenges him to a duel. To add to the confusion all around, the Marchesa immediately proposes that Giulietta and Edoardo be married immediately. However, the false King returns and proposes that he will decide on a solution that will satisfy everyone.\n\n\"Scene 1: The gallery of Kelbar's castle\"\n\nFollowing the \"King's\" pronouncement, the servants are mystified and they sing a carefree chorus which leads to Edoardo seeking their support and announcing his hope of still be able to marry Giulietta: \"Pietoso al lungo pianto...Deh lasciate a un alma amante\".\n\nBelfiore, the Treasurer, and Giulietta enter discussing the reasons for Baron Kelbar's opposition to his daughter's marriage to Eduardo. Giulietta explains that the young man's poverty is the main objection and so Belfiore immediately rules that the Treasurer must give up one of his castles and give over a sum of money to the young man, and then all will be well. The latter is somewhat reluctant to disobey his sovereign, but seeks a way out of his duel with Baron Kelbar.\n\n\"Scene 2: A veranda overlooking the castle gardens\"\n\nBelfiore and the Marchesa meet on the veranda, the former still unable to reveal who he really is. This incenses the lady, who boldly states that it is her intention to marry the Count of Ivrea. However, she cannot understand why Belfiore is taking so long to reveal himself and still hopes for his change of heart: (andante) \"Si mostri a chi l'adora...\". When Count Ivrea is announced, she takes a defiant stand (cabaletta): \"Si, scordar saprò l'infido\". Since Eduardo has pledged to join the \"King\" when he goes to Poland, Giulietta is determined to get the King to rescind the commitment. The Count enters and the Marchesa once again states that she will marry the Count. However, Belfiore immediately forbids the marriage for 'reasons of state' and announces that he and the Count must leave for Poland to deal with state business.\n\nAll express their feelings, but things come to a halt when a letter arrives for Belfiore. It is from King Stanislaw announcing his safe arrival in Warsaw and releasing Belfiore from his task of impersonating him. In return, the King has created him Marshal. Before dropping the disguise, the \"King\" proclaims that Giulietta and Eduardo are to be married and, having received Baron Kelbar's consent, reads the true king's letter and reveals his true rank. He expresses his love for the Marchesa and all ends happily with the prospect of two weddings.\n\nThe music of the piece shows the influence of Rossini and Donizetti. The haste in which the work was written may account for some of the uneven quality some critics have noted. With regard to the recitatives, Gossett notes that \"only his youthful comic opera, \"Un giorno di regno\" (1840), uses secco recitative\".\n\nNotes\n\nCited sources\n\nOther sources\n\n"}
{"id": "1941559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941559", "title": "Northampton loop", "text": "Northampton loop\n\nThe Northampton loop is a railway line serving the town of Northampton. It is a branch of the West Coast Main Line, deviating from the faster direct main line which runs to the west. The WCML is a four track line up to either end of the Loop: the 'up' and 'down' fast tracks take the direct route while the 'up' and 'down' slow tracks are diverted via Northampton railway station.\n\nThe southern interconnect between the Northampton loop and the direct London–Birmingham main line is at Hanslope Junction, just north of Milton Keynes. The lines continue to run alongside until the two routes diverge north of Roade at the northern end of Roade cutting. The loop line then runs north east for several miles until it reaches Northampton station. After Northampton, the line heads to the north-west for around twenty miles, until it re-joins the main line at Hillmorton Junction at Rugby, just east of Rugby station. The line is a total of long.\n\nThe majority of passenger services on the line are provided by West Midlands Trains using Class 350 electric multiple units. Class 319 units are used for peak-hour express services between Northampton and London Euston. The service consists of three 'semi fast' trains per hour between London Euston and Birmingham New Street. There is also an hourly local service between Northampton and Birmingham. Prior to December 2012 there was also a service to and from Crewe, but a few serve the loop line during morning and evenings and hourly on Sundays.\n\nAvanti West Coast provide a small number of Class 390 \"Pendolino\" services to London at the extremes of the day. But nearly all Avanti West Coast trains use the direct main line. Line speeds on the loop line are currently limited to compared to on the fast line, making the line unattractive to the routing of fast services. As of 2011, line speeds were expected to increase to once signalling improvements are in place north of Northampton up to Rugby.\n\nLong Buckby; the one other station on the line, is served by the London–Birmingham/Northampton–Birmingham services. The London–Crewe service does not stop at Long Buckby except on Sundays.\n\nThe line sees heavy freight traffic, as it is used by all freight trains on the southern part of the WCML. Many of these are container trains, with some serving the Daventry International Railfreight Terminal (DIRFT), which is between Northampton and Rugby (thus on the loop line).\n\nWhen the London and Birmingham Railway (L&BR) was constructed in the 1830s, Northampton was by-passed, with the line running on high ground to the west via Kilsby Tunnel. Traditionally this was said to have been because Northampton landowners objected to\nhaving a railway run to the town. However, more recently, railway historians have argued that Northampton was by-passed because the gradients would have been too steep for early locomotives to easily cope with. Robert Stephenson the engineer of the London and Birmingham Railway was determined to avoid gradients steeper than 1:330. As Northampton is located in the Nene Valley, lower than Blisworth, the closest point the L&BR came, connecting the town would have required gradients steeper than this.\n\nThis meant however that Northampton, despite being a large town, did not have direct rail links to London. A branch from the main line was built to Northampton in the early 1840s, the Northampton and Peterborough Railway, from Blisworth, which gave the town indirect rail links to London and Birmingham.\n\nThe loop line was constructed in the late 1870s by the London and North Western Railway and was opened in 1881 (by this stage locomotives had become far more powerful). It was constructed to improve rail services to Northampton and give the town a direct link to London. It also had the advantage of doubling capacity on the line from Roade to Rugby without the expense of widening the tunnel at Kilsby.\n\nThe line was electrified along with the rest of the WCML during the 1960s in the wake of the BR 1955 Modernisation Plan.\n\nThe only stations that are currently operational on the route are Northampton and Long Buckby. Previously there were five stations on the loop line, but only these two survive. The three stations closed were:\n\n\nWarwickshire County Council have proposed a new station on the Northampton Loop Line called Rugby Parkway, which would be on the south-eastern outskirts of Rugby serving the Hillmorton area of the town. The purpose of this would be to accommodate the future expansion of the town. If it goes ahead the new station is planned to open in 2019.\n\n\n"}

It is a subsidiary of the Go-Ahead Group.\n\nBrighton & Hove was established in 1884 as Brighton, Hove and Preston United Omnibus Company. In 1916, Thomas Tilling took over the company and replaced all its remaining horse buses with motor buses. In November 1935 it was formed as the Brighton Hove and District Omnibus Company. In January 1969 it merged with Southdown Motor Services as a subsidiary of the National Bus Company. In January 1985 in preparation for privatisation, Brighton & Hove was separated from Southdown. In May 1987 it was sold in a management buyout. In November 1993 Brighton & Hove was sold to the Go-Ahead Group.\n\nThe company's routes cover a large area encompassing the whole of the city, some parts of West and East Sussex and a single route into Kent. There are 40 separately-numbered standard routes. Frequencies range from every 5 minutes to two journeys per day. In addition, there are nine night bus routes and 19 school bus routes. In September 2005, the company took over many routes previously operated partly or entirely by Stagecoach South, the best example being the \"Coaster\" services 12 and 13X to Seaford and Eastbourne.\n\nThe company operates from three depots: Conway Street, Whitehawk and Lewes Road. Conway Street also serves as the company's headquarters. The company also has four outstations in Newhaven, Eastbourne, Uckfield and Durrington.\n\nDuring 1996/97, five of the most popular routes (1/1A, 5/5A/5B, 7, 25 and 49) were enhanced with new buses and individual route branding. All five routes offer regular services, modern buses and a wide range of connections throughout the centre of Brighton and Hove, reinforced by a colour-coded diagrammatic map Since 2004, Brighton & Hove have gradually introduced new buses to the Metro routes, the majority being Scania OmniDekkas. In April 2011, Metro 7 was removed from the Metro network and rebranded as Route 7 with brand new Wright Eclipse Gemini bodied Volvo B9TLs operating on the route. The last Metro branded buses in service were the Scania OmniCity double deckers delivered in 2009, mostly operating on Metro 5. The final few examples of Metro branding were removed in October 2013.\n\nThe Regency Route (29) is one of Brighton & Hove's branded routes. It began as route 729 by the nationalised Southdown Motor Services subsidiary of the National Bus Company, of which Brighton & Hove was a part, and the route was part of the NBC's cross-country \"Stagecoach\" network. It runs from Churchill Square to Tunbridge Wells, using specially-branded Scania OmniDekkas, which have high-backed Fainsa seats. Route 29 runs half-hourly, with one bus per hour serving Isfield and the other running via Rose Hill between Lewes and Uckfield. Route 28 follows the same route from Brighton to Lewes, with a service every half-hour just to Lewes and an alternate service every half-hour to Ringmer, providing a combined service every 10 minutes between Brighton and Lewes.\n\nBrighton & Hove face limited competition on some of its network of routes. The Big Lemon bus operator, a community interest company founded in 2007 who used to run a route between the University of Sussex and central Brighton, is the largest competitor. It was set up in an effort to make Brighton and Hove's public transport options more sustainable by using biodiesel collected by the company from businesses around the city as well as offering private hire services.\n\nThe Big Lemon originally operated an express service numbered 42X which ran from Brighton station to Falmer station using elderly step entranced buses. However the service was dropped in December 2007. A relaunch of the service commenced in early 2008 numbered 42. In 2010 the company started two more services, 43 and 44. However just months after it began route 43 ended due to low passenger numbers. In 2011 The Big Lemon faced competition from Brighton & Hove Buses in that Brighton Buses lowered its fares to match fares charged by The Big Lemon. In January 2012 The Big Lemon stopped running route 42 and continued to run route 44 only, split into two shuttles numbered UB1 and UB2. The Big Lemon subsequently ceased operation of these services, and shuttle UB1 is operated by the University of Brighton.\n\nOther companies which run into the city include Metrobus, which operates routes 270 (to/from East Grinstead), 271, 272 and 273 (all to/from Crawley, with the former two also serving RSC Hospital), as well as Stagecoach South which runs route 17 Horsham to Churchill Square and route 700 Portsmouth to Brighton.\n\nUnder the Transport Act 1985 Brighton and Hove City Council has the authority to put out to tender contracts (>5 years) to fill gaps in bus availability that arise due to lack of profitability.\nFor example, the 81, 81A and 81C buses are subsidised, depending on route, from .03p (based on operations Monday – Saturday services) up to £1.32 (based on Winter Sunday evening services) for each fare bought.\nThe council is also obliged to subsidise school bus routes. For example, the 91 Cardinal Newman School bus is currently subsidised at £4.10 per single journey.\n\nBrighton & Hove Bus and Coach Company operates the majority of the contracts.\n\nThe company operates, to a large extent, a flat fare system – people can travel on almost all of its buses, and to almost everywhere on its network, for fixed prices. The CitySaver ticket allows people to travel as often as they want for one day anywhere on any combination of buses, with a few exceptions. There are also longer-period season tickets, there are tickets valid also with local rail services and other bus operators, and various concessions for students, people under 16, passengers boarding at Brighton Station and several others .\n\nIn late 2011 the company started to introduce \"the Key\", a smart card system, in a bid to curb ticket sharing and speed up boarding times. The new system has yet to prove itself with many older people and foreign students needing direction on how to actually use \"the Key\". It can also be used on some local train journeys.\n\nContactless payments were first made available in November 2018 as a method for payment, and in September 2019, the company piloted the first tap-on, tap-off contactless scheme in the UK alongside its sister company, Metrobus, with aims to improve boarding times and make travelling convenient.\n\nMany of the company's buses have the name of a famous person commemorated on the front.\n\nIn 1999 the company ran a competition asking local residents to name the 20 new double-decker buses that had just been added to its fleet. The company had started with names such as \"Brighton Belle\", \"Brighton Rock\", \"Brighton Pier\", \"Brighton & Hove Albion\", \"Hove Actually\" and \"Brighton and Hove in Bloom\", and then asked local residents for help. It considered the options of naming the buses after landmarks in the town, people from the past, and present day celebrities with local connections.\n\nIn April 2004 the company added another 18 buses to its fleet, and continued the practice of naming them. The company's stated rule for choosing the name was: \"The nominations must have made a significant contribution to the life of the local area during their lifetime and must have since died.\" However several living people are in fact featured on the bus fronts.\n\nIn September 2005 the company added a further 19 buses to its fleet, naming them after people who had \"made great contributions to the city\" – and including more female names, after complaints that the system had been too male-dominated up to that point. For a year one of the buses had been named after local historian and journalist Adam Trimingham.\n\nAs of August 2016 the fleet consists of 326 buses and coaches.\nThe company mainly uses Scania Omnidekkas, Wright Eclipse Geminis, and Wright Streetdecks. The fleet also features Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated buses and Scania Omnilinks. In October 2019 the company received 30 Alexander Dennis Euro VI Microhybrid Enviro 400s to be used on Route 5 in Brighton and Hove's ULEZ. As Route 5 gained 30 more buses for the route, most Wright eclipse Geminis that were liveried with route 5 branding were repainted to the standard livery known as BH4.\n\n\n\n"}

A Democrat, he served as a U.S. Senator from Nebraska from 1976 until his death from a heart attack in Omaha in 1987. He was the first Jew elected to statewide office in Nebraska, and was previously the mayor of Omaha, elected as a Republican.\n\nBorn and raised in Omaha, Zorinsky's parents were Sonia (née Feldman) and Hymie Zorinsky, both Russian-Jewish immigrants. He attended Saunders and Rosehill elementary schools and graduated from Central High School in 1945. Zorinsky attended the University of Minnesota (1945–1946) and Creighton University (1946–1948) before completing his studies at the University of Nebraska, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry and zoology in 1949.\n\nFor twenty-three years, Zorinsky worked in the wholesale tobacco and candy business. He also served in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1949 to 1962. He enrolled at Harvard University in 1966 to pursue his graduate work, and later served as a member of the Nebraska Judicial Qualifications Commission (1968–1971) and of the Board of Directors for Omaha Public Power District (1969–1973). From 1973 to 1976, he served as Mayor of Omaha. He earned a great deal of popularity due to his response to a blizzard and a series of tornadoes that hit Omaha in 1975.\n\nIn 1976, Zorinsky, a hitherto lifelong Republican, decided to run for the U.S. Senate after 22-year incumbent Roman Hruska decided not to seek re-election. However, when it became apparent he would not win the Republican nomination, he switched parties and became a Democrat. He defeated Hess Dyas, a former state party chairman, for the Democratic nomination. In the general election, he defeated U.S. Representative John Y. McCollister by a margin of 53%–47%. With his victory, he became the first Democratic Senator elected from Nebraska since 1934 and the first Jew ever to win a statewide election in Nebraska.\n\nDays before the end of his term, Hruska resigned from the Senate on December 27, 1976, and Governor J. James Exon appointed Zorinsky to the seat he had won in November. He was re-elected to a second term in 1982, receiving over 66% of the vote. As a Senator, Zorinsky was a moderate to conservative Democrat, voting with Republicans on some significant issues. He was courted by the Republicans to rejoin their party in 1982. He hinted that he might indeed change parties in 1986, but ultimately never made the switch. Zorinsky served as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs, in which position he advocated for financial and military assistance to the new Sandinista National Liberation Front regime in Nicaragua in 1979.\n\nZorinsky died after suffering a heart attack at the 1987 Omaha Press Club gridiron show, shortly after performing a song and dance routine. After his death, one of the largest man-made lakes in Nebraska was named after him: Ed Zorinsky Lake and the surrounding Zorinsky Lake Park are located in the city of Omaha. The Edward Zorinsky Federal Building in Omaha is also named in his honor.\n\n\n"}

Campus Security took down the posters within 24 hours and warned the students responsible of possible disciplinary action.\" Samaraskera responded by noting that she appreciated satire as a form of freedom of speech, but hoped that such debate be held in a cordial and respectable manner.\n\nIn the wake of deep government cuts to the cuts to the Alberta post-secondary sector in 2013, debate ensued on and off campus as to how the University should respond. Samarasekara undertook to limit her international travel. However, when personally invited by Alberta Premier Alison Redford, she traveled to China in September 2013 at a cost of $13,800. Responding to criticism, Samarasekara stated \"people will find reasons to criticize me whichever way I do it.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1941578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941578", "title": "Synteny", "text": "Synteny\n\nIn classical genetics, synteny describes the physical co-localization of genetic loci on the same chromosome within an individual or species. Today, however, biologists usually refer to synteny as the conservation of blocks of order within two sets of chromosomes that are being compared with each other. This concept can also be referred to as shared synteny.\n\nThe classical concept is related to genetic linkage: Linkage between two loci is established by the observation of lower-than-expected recombination frequencies between them. In contrast, any loci on the same chromosome are by definition syntenic, even if their recombination frequency cannot be distinguished from unlinked loci by practical experiments. Thus, in theory, all linked loci are syntenic, but not all syntenic loci are necessarily linked. Similarly, in genomics, the genetic loci on a chromosome are syntenic regardless of whether this relationship can be established by experimental methods such as DNA sequencing/assembly, genome walking, physical localization or hap-mapping.\n\nStudents of genetics employ the term synteny to describe the situation in which two genetic loci have been assigned to the same chromosome but still may be separated by a large enough distance in map units that genetic linkage has not been demonstrated.\n\nThe Encyclopædia Britannica gives the following description of synteny:\n\"Synteny\" is a neologism meaning \"on the same ribbon\"; Greek: ', \"syn\" = along with + ', \"tainiā\" = band, referring to the same order of genes on two (homologous) strings of DNA (or chromosomes).\n\nShared synteny (also known as conserved synteny) describes preserved co-localization of genes on chromosomes of different species. During evolution, rearrangements to the genome such as chromosome translocations may separate two loci, resulting in the loss of synteny between them. Conversely, translocations can also join two previously separate pieces of chromosomes together, resulting in a gain of synteny between loci. Stronger-than-expected shared synteny can reflect selection for functional relationships between syntenic genes, such as combinations of alleles that are advantageous when inherited together, or shared regulatory mechanisms.\n\nThe term is sometimes also used to describe preservation of the precise order of genes on a chromosome passed down from a common ancestor, although many geneticists reject this use of the term.\n\nThe analysis of synteny in the gene order sense has several applications in genomics. Shared synteny is one of the most reliable criteria for establishing the orthology of genomic regions in different species. Additionally, exceptional conservation of synteny can reflect important functional relationships between genes. For example, the order of genes in the \"Hox cluster\", which are key determinants of the animal body plan and which interact with each other in critical ways, is essentially preserved throughout the animal kingdom.\n\nSynteny is widely used in studying complex genomes, as comparative genomics allows the presence and possibly function of genes in a simpler, model organism to infer those in a more complex one. For example, wheat has a very large, complex genome which is difficult to study. In 1994 research from the John Innes Centre in England and the National Institute of Agrobiological Research in Japan demonstrated that the much smaller rice genome had a similar structure and gene order to that of wheat. Further study found that many cereals are syntenic and thus plants such as rice or the grass \"Brachypodium\" could be used as a model to find genes or genetic markers of interest which could be used in wheat breeding and research. In this context, synteny was also essential in identifying a highly important region in wheat, the Ph1 locus involved in genome stability and fertility, which was located using information from syntenic regions in rice and Brachypodium.\n\nSynteny is also widely used in microbial genomics. In Rhizobiales and Enterobacteriales, syntenic genes encode a large number of essential cell functions and represent a high level of functional relationships.\n\nPatterns of shared synteny or synteny breaks can also be used as characters to infer the phylogenetic relationships among several species, and even to infer the genome organization of extinct ancestral species. A qualitative distinction is sometimes drawn between macrosynteny, preservation of synteny in large portions of a chromosome, and microsynteny, preservation of synteny for only a few genes at a time.\n\nShared synteny between different species can be inferred from their genomic sequences. This is typically done using a version of the MCScan algorithm, which finds syntenic blocks between species by comparing their homologous genes and looking for common patterns of collinearity on a chromosomal or contig scale. Homologies are usually determined on the basis of high bit score BLAST hits that occur between multiple genomes. From here, dynamic programming is used to select the best scoring path of shared homologous genes between species, taking into account potential gene loss and gain which may have occurred in the species' evolutionary histories.\n\n\n"}

The film was directed by Michael Apted. Dennis Potter won a 1984 Edgar Award for his screenplay for the film.\n\nThe main stars of the film are William Hurt as Arkady Renko, Lee Marvin as Jack Osborne, Joanna Pacula as Irina Asanova, Rikki Fulton as Major Pribluda, Brian Dennehy as William Kirwill, Ian McDiarmid as Professor Andreev, Michael Elphick as Pasha and Ian Bannen as Prosecutor Iamskoy. James Horner wrote the score. Ralf D. Bode was cinematographer.\n\nPacuła was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture and Elphick for a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nMoscow \"militsiya\" officer Arkady Renko is called to the site of three dead bodies in a Gorky Park ice rink. All have been shot in the chest and their faces and finger tips removed; two were also shot in the mouth. Renko becomes anxious when the KGB refuses to take over the investigation. Renko traces the woman's skates to a movie set worker, Irina Asanova, who claims that they were stolen. Based on the forensics, the doctor identifies one young man as a foreigner, likely an American. Renko asks Professor Levi Andreev to reconstruct two of their faces.\n\nAt the dacha of Chief Prosecutor Iamskoy, Renko makes the acquaintance of American sable importer Jack Osborne, who is accompanied by Asanova. Renko also crosses paths with William Kirwill, a New York detective who is investigating the disappearance of his brother James.\n\nRenko eventually identifies the victims: James Kirwill and two friends of Asanova. He discovers that they were constructing a chest for Osborne. Renko's suspicion of Osborne mounts following several polite but tense conversations in social settings. When a KGB officer attempts to kill Asanova with an injected overdose, Renko saves her. Nursing her, they become involved romantically although she doesn't entirely trust him. Kirwill finally finds out about Osborne's chest. It was designed to smuggle out six live sables and break the Soviet monopoly, potentially earning Osborne millions. Osborne had promised Asanova's friends to smuggle them out of the Soviet Union; he tells Asanova her friend is in Manhattan.\n\nRenko confronts Asanova with Prof. Andreev's reconstructed head of her girlfriend, forcing her to accept they have been murdered. She confesses to the plot and flees. Renko and Kirwill go to retrieve the second reconstructed head, but a KGB agent emerges with it. They follow him to Iamskoy's dacha and watch as Osborne and Iamskoy supervise the head's destruction. To Kirwill's horror, it is his brother's head, but they overhear a deal between Osborne and Iamskoy. Renko confronts Iamskoy in a bath house and Iamskoy admits that he kept Renko on the case to force Osborne to pay a larger bribe to smuggle out the sables. He offers to cut Renko in, but Renko reveals that he has recorded their conversation. Iamskoy wrestles Renko for his gun, which goes off and kills Iamskoy.\n\nOsborne flees to Stockholm. The KGB allows Renko to travel to supervise an exchange. He is to receive the sables from Osborne and kill them and Osborne. Renko meets Osborne at his apartment and finds Asanova there. She confesses that she fled to Osborne, who has included her freedom in the deal, and promises Renko that his freedom can also be included. She reveals that Osborne is planning a double cross as he has 12 sables, not just six. Renko meets with Kirwill and they predict that, following the exchange, the KGB will kill Asanova, Renko and Osborne. Kirwill agrees to be at the exchange to help Renko and Asanova.\n\nThe next morning, Renko and three KGB agents meet Osborne at a farm. They come across Kirwill's body tied to a tree with his intestines hanging out. Osborne announces that he gutted Kirwill after Kirwill killed his dogs. Osborne produces six dead sables and asks the men to lower their weapons. Renko realizes that neither side will let the other live. When Osborne shoots a KGB agent, Renko grabs Asanova and runs for the woods. KGB Major Pribluda then kills the other KGB agent before Osborne kills Pribluda.\n\nOsborne tries to shoot Renko, who finds live sables in cages. Asanova emerges from the woods and Osborne threatens to kill her if Renko does not surrender. When Renko emerges to give up, Asanova shoots Osborne. Renko, too, shoots Osborne before Asanova kills Osborne. She asks Renko to go away with her, but Renko reveals he agreed to kill Osborne in return for her safety and freedom from the Soviet Union, and that they would both be killed if Renko did not return. Renko returns to his job in Moscow.\n\nRenko ends up freeing the sables, which run off into the woods as Asanova's voice repeats Renko's promise that they will meet again one day.\n\n\"Gorky Park\" was filmed in Helsinki and Stockholm, as the crew were denied access to Moscow. The Kaisaniemi public park in the Helsinki centre was set as the Gorky amusement park.\n\nAccording to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 75% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 6.53/10. Janet Maslin called it \"a taut, clever thriller throughout, with Mr. Apted's direction establishing its intensity immediately and sustaining it well. Ralf G. Bode's cinematography and James Horner's score go a long way toward setting a hauntingly bleak mood, and the supporting players, particularly Brian Dennehy and Ian Bannen, are excellent\". Though she found it odd that Hurt would affect an English accent, she found his performance \"rivetingly strange\".\n\nRoger Ebert found the depiction of Soviet society to be the most interesting aspect of the film, and he credited Apted's direction for never letting the procedural lag. Ebert also praised the casting, even if it relied on typecasting an actor like Marvin. \"He uses actors who are able to bring fully realized characters to the screen, so we don't have to stand around waiting for introductions\".\n\n\"Gorky Park\" was released to DVD by MGM Home Video on April 1, 2003 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD and to Blu-ray Disc by Kino Lorber (under license from MGM) on October 21, 2014.\n\n"}

He was noted for his active resistance to westward expansion and the United States federal government. It is due to the courage and determination of Morning Star and other leaders that the Northern Cheyenne still possess a homeland in their traditional country in present-day Montana.\n\nAlthough he was known as \"Dull Knife\" (or \"Motšêške Ôhnêxahpo\" in Cheyenne, a translation of his Lakota name) to local settlers, U.S. military leaders, and other American Indians, his Cheyenne name is translated as \"Morning Star\". A Cheyenne warrior in every sense of the word, Morning Star was described by many writers of the era as \"an admirable outlaw\" comparable to the likes of Rob Roy and William Wallace.\n\nIn 1851, Morning Star represented his tribe at the signing of the Treaty of Fort Laramie. Following Custer's Last Stand at the Battle of the Little Bighorn during the Great Sioux War of 1876, Morning Star allied with the Sioux and other tribes against the United States. However, after a destructive raid by American soldiers under Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie in which 200 lodges were destroyed and 700 livestock captured, most of the Cheyenne were eventually forced to surrender. They expected to live on reservations with the Sioux in the north, but were subsequently transported to the Darlington Agency in the Southern Cheyenne Reservation in the Indian Territory.\n\nUnable to hunt sufficient game while on the reservation, the tribe suffered from starvation and disease until September 1878, when Morning Star led the tribe north, back toward their ancient homelands. Fighting through, the Cheyenne were able to outmaneuver federal troops across the plains and in the Nebraska Sand Hills until they were captured near Fort Robinson. The tribe was said to have taken apart their guns and hidden the pieces under blankets or as necklaces and bracelets worn by children. Though Morning Star explained that his people would put up no further resistance if allowed to live with Red Cloud on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in the Dakota Territory, the Army still insisted that they return south to the Southern Cheyenne reservation. On January 8, 1879, the Northern Cheyenne tried to escape the fort using the dismantled guns they had hidden upon their arrival, but they were quickly pursued; many Cheyenne, mostly women and children, were killed by federal troops in the Fort Robinson massacre. However, a few of the tribe managed to escape, including Morning Star, who eventually reached the Pine Ridge Agency and was held as a prisoner until he and the survivors were allowed to settle on a reservation near Fort Keogh in the Montana Territory.\n\nMorning Star died in 1883 and is interred on the Northern Cheyenne reservation at Lame Deer Cemetery. Chief Dull Knife College, which is also in Lame Deer, is named in his honor. As Dull Knife, his photograph appears in Dee Brown's 1971 bestseller \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\".\n\nActor Ian McDonald played Dull Knife in the May 1957 episode \"Dull Knife Strikes for Freedom\" on the ABC/Desilu western television series, \"The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\", with Hugh O'Brian in the title role as deputy marshal Wyatt Earp. In the episode, Dull Knife leads his Indians from their reservation in Oklahoma Territory to their homeland in Montana, which they claim the U.S. government had promised them. Meanwhile, some of their braves attack and burn a white settlement.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1941598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941598", "title": "Coat of arms of Spain", "text": "Coat of arms of Spain\n\nThe coat of arms of Spain represents Spain and the Spanish nation, including its national sovereignty and the country's form of government, a constitutional monarchy. It appears on the flag of Spain and it is used by the Government of Spain, the Cortes Generales, the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, and other state institutions. Its design consists of the arms of the medieval kingdoms that would unite to form Spain in the 15th century, the Royal Crown, the arms of the House of Bourbon, the Pillars of Hercules and the Spanish national motto: \"Plus Ultra\". The Monarch, the heir to the throne and some institutions like the Senate, the Council of State and the General Council of the Judiciary have their own variants of the coat of arms.\n\nThe blazon of the Spanish coat of arms is composed as follows:\n\nThe contemporary Spanish coat of arms, featured in the national flag of Spain, was approved by law in 1981, in replacement of the interim coat of arms that replaced the official arms of Spain under Franco (1939–75).\n\nThe Spanish coat of arms is composed of six other arms and some additional heraldic symbols:\n\nThe present version is regulated by:\n\n\nThe official design of the coat of arms of Spain is like a logotype set in linear style: drawing, proportions of elements and colours (CIELAB). This approach has been criticised by Spanish heraldists for three reasons.\n\nFirst, the coat of arms pattern is simplified, compared to the usual heraldic usages, which relevantly considers the way of representing the charges and tinctures, because they must be easily identifiable, without error; however, the colours determined by the decree are difficult to distinguish. In particular, the Or and the Gules have been respectively represented so intensely and so darkly that they do not allow for clear distinction of the charges. The colour chosen to represent Purpure is criticised for being a pinkish hue, unlike the traditional hues of the Kingdom of Leon and heraldic custom.\n\nSecond, the style of the official design does not fit into traditional Iberian heraldic norms. The Escutcheon shape is midway between the modern French style, rectangular with a slightly convex bottom edge, and the Spanish style, with an almost semicircular bottom edge. The \"Enté en point\" of the arms of Granada also is represented in the French tradition, with slightly convex top edges, instead of the sharp curved-top edges of Iberian heraldry.\n\nThird, the inescutcheon, superimposed on the main shield, is elliptical rather than the usual escutcheon shape, which is considered imprecise.\n\nThe Arms of the Kingdom of Spain was the official coat of arms of the Monarch of Spain from the time of the Catholic Monarchs, and was used as the official arms of the Kingdom until the First Spanish Republic in 1873. Afterwards, the arms became an integral part of the Coat of Arms of Spain. The different governments since (whether republican or monarchist) have led to the arms being changed on various occasions, but always respecting the main heraldic design involving the former kingdoms and, in many cases, the pillars of Hercules.\n\nAs a reward for his successful voyage of discovery, the Spanish sovereigns granted Columbus the right to bear arms. According to the blazon specified in letters patent dated May 20, 1493, Columbus was to bear in the first and the second quarters the royal charges of Castile and Leon, the Castle and the Lion, but with different tinctures or colours. In the third quarter would be islands in a wavy sea, and in the fourth, the customary arms of his family.\n\nThe arms of the Catholic Monarchs, Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, whose marriage unified Spain, were:\n\n\nAfter Isabella I's death in 1504, Ferdinand used different arms, namely tierced per pale Castile-León, Aragon-Naples-Sicily, and Aragon. The annexation of Navarre (1513) brought about the final change in the arms of the \"Rey Católico\" (Catholic King): the second quarter was changed to per pale, 1. per fess Aragon and Navarra, 2. per fess Jerusalem and Hungary.\n\nThe arms as used in Navarra (until 1700) were Quarterly:\n\nThe arms used in Aragon were either Aragon, or per pale, Castile-León and Aragon, or tierced per pale, Aragon-Sicily, Aragon and tierced per pale Hungary, Anjou-Naples and Jerusalem. In Naples, the arms were Quarterly, 1 and 4. Castile-León, 2. per pale Aragon and per pale Jerusalem-Hungary; 3. per pale Aragon and Aragon-Sicily.\n\nAt the death of Isabella I of Castile in 1504, her son-in-law Archduke Philip the Handsome immediately staked his claim to her inheritance by quartering his own arms with those of the Catholic Monarchs. He had previously borne quarterly: Austria, Burgundy modern, Burgundy ancient and Brabant, with an escutcheon overall per pale Flanders and Tyrol. Since his highest title was archduke and the Spanish titles were all royal, the Spanish quarters were given precedence over his. Hence the arrangement became, quarterly: 1. and 4. grand quarters, quarterly: A. and D. quarterly Castile-León, B. and C. per pale Aragon-Sicily, the grand quarter enté en point for Granada; 2. and 3. grand quarters, quarterly Austria, Burgundy ancient, Burgundy modern, Brabant, with an escutcheon per pale Flanders and Tyrol.\n\nCharles I marshalled his arms in a number of ways. In the first years of his reign, he most frequently used the same arrangement as his father. After his election as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519 he placed it on the breast of an imperial eagle. Later in his reign a simplified version appears. The arms are per fess with the Spanish quarters in chief and the Austrian quarters in base. This version became very popular in the Netherlands. There it is often seen with the imperial eagle placed on a golden shield, ensigned with the imperial crown and supported by a lion and a griffin. The Order of the Golden Fleece then hangs suspended round the main shield.\n\nIn other parts of his extensive monarchy, a number of variations are to be found. Many concern the way in which the Aragonese realms are represented and therefore probably relate to the Crown of Aragon or to one of its constituent parts. In 1516 for instance, he is found using arms quarterly of Spain (quarterly Castile-León and Aragon-Aragon-Sicily, with Granada enté en point) and Austria (quarterly Austria, Burgundy modern, Burgundy ancient and Brabant) with an escutcheon overall per pale Flanders and Tyrol. In 1520, the quarter of Aragon and Aragon-Sicily are replaced per pale Aragon and Naples (per pale Jerusalem and Hungary).\n\nAfter 1530 some versions display quarterly: 1. and 4. grand quarters Spain, which is quarterly A. and D. Castile-León, B. and C. per pale a. per fess Aragon and Navarra, b. per pale Naples (Jerusalem and Hungary); 2. and 3. grand quarters Austria, (as above); enté en point Granada. These arms are borne by an imperial double-headed eagle sable, surmounted by an imperial crown, surrounded with the collar of the Golden Fleece and accompanied by the pillars of Hercules and the motto PLUS ULTRA.\n\nIn Sicily on the other hand, Emperor Charles V used quarterly 1. and 4. Castile-León, 2. tierced per pale Aragon, Jerusalem and Hungary, 3. per pale Aragon and Aragon-Sicily, enté en point Granada. Overall in chief, a double-headed eagle sable crowned or bearing an escutcheon of Austria. Later, his arms in that realm were quarterly, 1. Castile-León, 2. quarterly Aragon, Aragon-Sicily, Navarra and Aragon, 3. quarterly Austria, Burgundy modern, Burgundy ancient and Brabant, overall an escutcheon per pale Flanders and Tyrol; 4. per pale Naples (Jerusalem and Hungary); enté en point Granada, these arms borne by an imperial eagle.\n\nDuring the reign of King Phillip II the arms of the Spanish Monarchy become fixed for the remainder of the House of Austria. Originally Philip II used the simplified arms as devised for his father, namely per fess with the Spanish quarters in chief and the Austrian quarters in base.\n\nAfter the unification with Portugal in 1580 (due to the death of the Portuguese king), the arms of the Monarchy became per fess, in chief per pale, A. quarterly Castile and León, B. per pale Aragon and Aragon-Sicily, the whole enté en point Granada and with an escutcheon of Portugal on the honour point; in base quarterly Austria, Burgundy ancient, Burgundy modern and Brabant, with an escutcheon (in the nombril point) per pale Flanders and Tyrol. The arms were crowned with a royal crown with three visible arches and the Order of the Golden Fleece was suspended around them. In the Netherlands, the arms were regularly supported by two golden lions guardant.\n\nEven though Portugal and its possessions were lost in 1640, the Spanish kings retained the use of the Portuguese arms as arms of pretence until 1668.\n\nPhilip was born in Versailles. He was made the Duc d'Anjou upon his birth. He was the second son of Louis, \"le Grand Dauphin\". In the year 1700, the King of Spain, Charles II, died. Charles' will named the 17-year-old Philip, the grandson of Charles' sister Maria Theresa, as his successor. Upon any possible refusal the Crown of Spain would be offered next to Philip's younger brother Charles, Duke of Berry, or to Archduke Charles of Austria.\n\nBoth claimants had a legal right due to the fact that Philip's grandfather, Louis XIV of France and Charles's father, Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, were both the husbands of Charles' older half sisters and sons of Charles' aunts.\n\nPhilip had the better claim because his grandmother and great-grandmother were older than Leopold's. However, the Austrian branch claimed that Philip's grandmother had renounced the Spanish throne for her descendants as part of her marriage contract. This was countered by the French branch's claim that it was on the basis of a dowry that had never been paid.\n\nAfter a long council meeting where the Dauphin spoke up in favour of his son's rights, it was agreed that Philip would ascend the throne but would forever renounce his claim to the throne of France for himself and his descendants. It was not difficult to see whether Louis would have refused anyway as a Habsburg ruler in Spain would've put a possible enemy on three frontiers.\n\nThe arms of Bourbon-Anjou were added in 1700 when Phillip V became king of Spain. He introduced changes in the royal arms of Spain. The king's new arms were designed by the French heraldist Clairambault in November 1700, and were as follows:\n\nper fess: 1. per pale, quarterly Castile and León, enté en point Granada, and per pale, Aragon and Aragon-Sicily; 2. Quarterly, Austria, Burgundy modern, Burgundy ancient and Brabant; enté en point, per pale Flanders and Tyrol. Overall an escutcheon Anjou. The abbreviated arms were quarterly Castile and León, enté en point Granada, overall Anjou.\n\nCharles III was the first son of the second marriage of Philip V with Elizabeth Farnese of Parma, he was one of the so-called \"enlightened monarchs\".\n\nIn 1761 Charles III modified the arms as follows:\n\nQuarterly of six (in three rows of two each): 1. per pale Aragon and Aragon-Sicily; 2. per pale Austria and Burgundy modern; 3. Farnese 4. Medici; 5. Burgundy ancient; 6. Brabant; enté en point per pale Flanders and Tyrol. Overall an escutcheon quarterly of Castile and León enté en point of Granada, overall Anjou. Around the shield are the collars of the Golden Fleece and of the French Holy Spirit (After the Order of Carlos III).\n\nThe abbreviated arms remained the same (they form the escutcheon en surtout of the state arms). They are accompanied by the Pillars of Hercules and the motto PLUS ULTRA and crowned with the royal crown, but do not show the collars. Already at this time the Anjou escutcheon was sometimes represented without its bordure gules.\n\nJoseph Napoleon I (born Corte 1768, died Firenze 1844), king of Spain (1808–1813), was the elder brother of the Emperor Napoleon I. Following his conquests, the Emperor placed members of his family on the throne of various European states, some of them being created accordingly. Joseph was the first king of Naples (1806).\n\nWhen Napoleon expelled the Bourbons from Spain, he placed Joseph on the throne and gave the throne of Naples to Marshal Murat, former Commander-in-Chief of the French troops in Spain and husband of Caroline Bonaparte, Napoleon's sister. The long and difficult Spanish War of Independence or Peninsular War, famously illustrated by the painter Francisco Goya, ended with the overthrow of Joseph in 1814.\n\nIn 1808, Joseph Napoleon proclaimed a new coat of arms:\n\nQuarterly of 6, in three rows of two each, 1. Castile; 2. Leon; 3. Aragon; 4. Navarra; 5. Granada; 6. Indies (Gules often Azure, the old and the new world or between the pillars of Hercules argent). Overall an escutcheon with Imperial France's eagle.\n\nIn 1813 the Allies returned Ferdinand VII of Spain to Madrid. The Spanish people, blaming the liberal, enlightened policies of the Francophiles (afrancesados) for incurring the Napoleonic occupation and the Peninsular War, at first welcomed \"Fernando\". Ferdinand soon found that while Spain was fighting for independence in his name and while in his name juntas had governed in Spanish America, a new world had been born of foreign invasion and domestic revolution. Spain was no longer an absolute monarchy under the liberal Constitution of 1812. Ferdinand, in being restored to the throne, guaranteed the liberals that he would govern on the basis of the existing constitution, but, encouraged by conservatives backed by the Church hierarchy, he rejected the constitution within weeks (May 4) and arrested the liberal leaders (May 10), justifying his actions as rejecting a constitution made by the Cortes Generales in his absence and without his consent. Thus he had come back to assert the Bourbon doctrine that the sovereign authority resided in his person only. Ferdinand VII of Spain reestablished the arms of Charles III, both the state arms and the abbreviated arms. The Anjou escutcheon became increasingly frequently an escutcheon of France.\n\nThe First Spanish Republic started with the abdication as King of Spain on February 10, 1873 of Amadeo I of Spain, following the Hidalgo Affair, when he had been required by the radical government to sign a decree against the artillery officers. The next day, February 11, the republic was declared by a parliamentary majority made up of radicals, republicans, and democrats. It lasted twenty-three months, between February 11, 1873, and 29 December 1874 and had five presidents: Estanislao Figueras, Pi i Margall, Nicolás Salmerón y Alonso, Emilio Castelar y Ripoll and Francisco Serrano.\n\nThe Provisional Government of 1868 adopted the present territorial arms: quarterly of Castile, Leon, Aragon and Navarre enté en point of Granada. The crown was a mural crown.\n\nDuring the brief reign of Amadeo, the royal crown was reinstated and an escutcheon of Savoy (\"Gules, a cross argent\") was placed \"en surtout\". There were not many Spanish arms including the escutcheon of Aosta (\"Argent, a cross gules within a bordure compony azure and or\"), the arms used by Amadeo before his accession to the throne of Spain.\n\nWhen the Bourbons were restored with Alfonso XII of Spain, a decree (8 January 1875) restored the use of the coat of arms as it stood until September 29, 1868. In practice, the Anjou escutcheon (actually called Borbón in Spanish) was displayed without the bordure, because the bordure was considered inessential, and the escutcheon an indication of lineage from the French Bourbon dynasty. With the death of Henri, comte de Chambord in 1883, Alfonso XII became the senior male representative of the French royal dynasty and thus bore its arms without difference. A striking example is given by the royal arms as they appear on the reverse of a 5 pesetas coin of Alfonso XII (1885). The king also used the grand as well as the abbreviated arms of Charles III as personal arms. In 1931 Alfonso XIII did away with the distinction between state and personal arms by combining the two. He took the arms of Charles III, substituted the Aragon quarter with Jerusalem, and replaced the escutcheon with the former national arms:\n\nQuarterly of 6, in three rows of two each: 1. per pale Aragon-Sicily and Jerusalem; 2. 2. per pale Austria and Burgundy modern; 3. Farnese 4. Medici; 5. Burgundy ancient; 6. Brabant; enté en point per pale Flanders and Tyrol. Overall an escutcheon quarterly of Castile, Leon, Aragon and Navarra enté en point of Granada, overall France.\n\nThe Second Spanish Republic is the name of the regime that existed in Spain between 14 April 1931, when King Alfonso XIII left the country, and 1 April 1939, when the last of the Republican (Loyalist) forces surrendered to Francoist (Nationalist) forces in the Spanish Civil War.\n\nThe Republic of 1931 used again the territorial arms as in the First Spanish Republic but depicting in the second quarter an uncrowned lion.\n\nThe Spanish Civil War officially ended on 1 April 1939, the day Francisco Franco announced the end of hostilities. The Republican forces had been defeated and Franco became the undisputed caudillo of Spain. He ruled Spain until he died on November 20, 1975.\n\nThe Nationalist senior generals had held an informal meeting in September 1936, where they elected Francisco Franco as leader of the Nationalists, with the rank of \"Generalísimo\". He was originally supposed to be only commander-in-chief, but after some discussion became head of state as well with nearly unlimited and absolute powers.\n\nFranco adopted in 1938 a variant of the Coat of Arms reinstating some elements originally used by the House of Trastámara such as Saint John's Eagle and the yoke and bundle, as follows:\n\nQuarterly, 1 and 4. quarterly Castile and León, 2 and 3. per pale Aragon and Navarra, \"enté en point\" of Granada. The arms are crowned with an open royal crown, placed on an eagle displayed sable, surrounded with the pillars of Hercules, the yoke and the bundle of arrows of the Catholic Monarchs.\n\n\n\n"}

There are two main types in service with NATO countries: the 40×46mm, which is a low-velocity round used in hand-held grenade launchers; and the high-velocity 40×53mm, used in mounted and crew-served weapons. The cartridges are not interchangeable. Both 40 mm cartridges use the High-Low Propulsion System.\n\nThe less powerful 40×46mm is used in hand-held weapons such as the M79, M203, and the multi-shot M32 MGL. The more powerful 40×53mm is used in automatic grenade launchers mounted on tripods, vehicles or helicopters, such as the Mk 19 grenade launcher. In these roles, the rounds are linked together with a metallic disintegrating-link belt.\n\n\nThe U.S. Army ARDEC began development of a 40 mm airburst fuze in 2011 to improve the ability of grenade launchers like the M203 and M320 to engage targets in defilade. Called Small Arms Grenade Munitions (SAGM), they double the lethality of the standard M433 grenade round by adding a small \"smart\" fuze sensor that detonates in the air to hit targets in cover or behind obstacles. The airburst function is similar to the XM25 CDTE, which has an onboard laser system to determine the distance to the target, but SAGM is considered complementary to the XM25 rather than competing against it, as the XM25 provides low-angle fire while 40 mm launchers fire a lobbing trajectory. Engineers integrated sensors and logic devices to scan and filter the environment and then autonomously airburst the fuze without needing to be told to by the firer, thereby not requiring the soldier to carry extra weapon accessories. SAGM enables soldiers to accurately incapacitate personnel targets in defilade at ranges between 50 and 500 meters. The round is engineered with three firing modes: airburst; point detonation; and self-destruct. A successful demonstration occurred in November 2013. Although the SAGM sensor does not need a laser rangefinder or any pre-fire programming sequence, it does require some skill by the user to aim and fire the round correctly so that it can detect the wall or obstruction to detonate in the air. The SAGM was to undergo evaluation in July 2015 and, if successful, transition into an official Army program of record by the end of the year. Not only does the fuze burst over walls, but it can detonate when passing cover like trees, bursting just as it senses and passes the trunk. The sort of sensor SAGM uses to differentiate clutter from triggering obstacles is highly classified, but shows airburst reliability of 76 percent.\n\nIt is a grenade caliber designed in Poland, and used in Pallad wz. 74 underbarrel grenade launchers (used with AK family rifles in use in Polish Army like the AKM/AKMS, Tantal and Beryl) and Pallad-D wz. 83 Grenade launcher (standalone variant fitted with standard pistol grip and folding stock from AKMS assault rifle). The construction is similar to one used in 40×46mm but grenades are not fully interchangeable.\n\nA caliber with this designation is also used in the Romanian AG-40\n\nExtended Range Low Pressure (ERLP) 40×51mm cartridges extend the range of 40 mm grenades from 400 m to 800 m and are manufactured by companies such as Rheinmetall Denel Munitions.\n\n\nThe MK285 consists of an electronic programmable fuze, a pre-fragmented warhead and a propulsion system. The fuze is programmed through the fire control of the gun. The fuze is mechanically armed at approximately 23 meters. The round is programmed to airburst over the target and the fuze counts down the programmed time via its built in electronics. If an unprogrammed round is fired, it will detonate on impact. The projectile has a built in self-destruct and can be fired by any automatic grenade launcher.\n\nDeveloped for and used by AGA-40 Md. 85\n\nOther weapons using 40 mm rounds include the Milkor MGL and the Heckler & Koch AG36 and its derivatives. There is also the STK 40 AGL and 40LWAGL from Singapore's ST Kinetics. The Daewoo K4 Grenade Machine Gun is in service with the South Korean Armed Services.\n\nThe Soviet GP-25 Kostyor and GP-30 Obuvka and Russian GP-34, BG-15 Mukha and RG-6 use a unique type of 40 mm grenade. These grenades hold their propellant in an expansion chamber at the base of the projectile, functioning more like mortar rounds than conventional cased ammunition. The Soviet 40 mm VOG-25 grenades are not interchangeable with US 40×46mm and 40×53mm weapons.\n\nThe Metal Storm Redback 40 mm Weapon System is a four-barrel, 16-round weapon system that uses preloaded barrels containing superposed 40 mm grenades with electrical priming, and is designed for mounting on vehicles.\n\nThe MK281 is a new type of 40 mm target practice grenade ammunition that has been accepted for use into the United States Marine Corps and the United States Army. It is \"green\" because it is non-toxic and non-dud producing (since it is a training round), meaning that there is no unexploded ordnance left to clean up on the range and heavy metals in the fuze do not leak into the ground. The MK281 was introduced into parts of the U.S. Armed Forces because of an executive order mandating that they buy green ammunition. The MK281 is manufactured by an American subsidiary of the Rheinmetall Group.\n\nThe United States Army has a requirement for a non-dud producing 40mm training ammunition in both high and low velocity variants. The Army awarded four contracts to three United States companies to test designs. The resulting ammunition will not contain explosive energetics and have day and night visible, infrared, and thermal signatures.\n\n\n"}

Miller\n\nWallace Conrad Miller (February 7, 1896 – October 4, 1959) was a Canadian politician who served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1936 to 1959, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Douglas L. Campbell.\n\nBorn in Waterloo County, Ontario, Miller was educated at schools in Ontario and Manitoba, and also in Germany and France. He worked as a real estate agent and Notary Public. He enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force in 1916, and served in France during World War I. Twice wounded, he returned home for medical reasons in June 1918. From 1926 to 1936, Miller served as chair of the Gretna School Board. He was a director of the Manitoba Trustees Association from 1932 to 1940, and was its president in 1939-40. He was also a police magistrate from 1926 to 1928, and a Justice of the Peace from 1932 to 1936.\n\nMiller ran for the House of Commons of Canada for the Conservative Party in the 1935 federal election, but lost to Howard Winkler of the Liberal Party by 520 votes, in the riding of Lisgar.\n\nHe was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1936 provincial election. A Conservative, he defeated Liberal-Progressive J.J. Enns by 358 votes in the constituency of Morden and Rhineland.\n\nIn 1940, the governing Liberal-Progressives formed an all-party coalition government with the Conservatives, CCF and Social Credit. Miller was re-elected in the 1941 election as a coalition Conservative, defeating three other pro-coalition candidates.\n\nIn early 1945, Miller resigned his seat to run for the Canadian House of Commons in the 1945 federal election. He again lost to Howard Winkler, this time by 295 votes.\n\nThe Morden & Rhineland seat had not been filled by the time of the 1945 provincial election, which allowed Miller to declare his candidacy for the constituency again. Still running as a coalition Conservative, he defeated coalition Liberal-Progressive J.R. Walkof by a narrow margin. In the 1949 provincial election, he was returned without opposition for the redistributed constituency of Rhineland.\n\nWhen Douglas Campbell became Premier on December 14, 1948, he appointed Miller as his Provincial Secretary. Miller retained this position until February 14, 1950, when he resigned to become Speaker of the Assembly.\n\nThe Progressive Conservative Party left the coalition government in the summer of 1950, to sit on the opposition benches. Though he had been known as a strongly partisan MLA, Miller opposed this opposition and left the Progressive Conservatives to sit with the Liberal-Progressives. He resigned as Speaker on August 15, 1950, and was re-appointed to cabinet the following day as Minister of Education.\n\nMiller was easily re-elected as a Liberal-Progressive in the 1953 election, defeating his Social Credit and Progressive Conservative opponents by a significant margin. He was again returned in the 1958 election, which saw the defeat of the Campbell government as Dufferin Roblin's Progressive Conservatives were able to form a minority administration. Miller formally resigned his cabinet position on June 30, 1958.\n\nMiller was re-elected in the 1959 provincial election, defeating Progressive Conservative Leo Reckseidler by the reduced margin of 186 votes. He died later in the year.\n\nNotwithstanding their name, Manitoba's Liberal-Progressives were to the right of the Progressive Conservatives, and governed the province in a conservative manner. Miller was a conservative figure in the Education portfolio, and regularly opposed calls for expanded school board areas. In 1956, he rejected outright a proposal for student loans.\n\nMiller was considered to be one of the most dramatic speakers in the legislature, and regularly sparred with CCF leader Lloyd Stinson.\n\nHe later had a school named in his honor in the town of Altona, Manitoba. It is called W.C. Miller Collegiate, and is home to the Miller Aces.\n"}
{"id": "1941605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941605", "title": "Singled Out", "text": "Singled Out\n\nSingled Out is an American dating game show created by Burt Wheeler & Sharon Sussman which originally ran on MTV from 1995 to 1998. Each episode featured a group of 50 singles competing for a date with one main contestant.\n\nThe original hosts were Chris Hardwick and Jenny McCarthy. When McCarthy left the show in early 1997 to star in her own sitcom, \"Jenny\", MTV hired Carmen Electra to replace her for the last season and a half.\n\nThe show became a cult classic, putting a more comedic spin on traditional and formal dating shows. Contestants would most likely be unconventional and cast purely for entertainment, without any assumed compatibility put into effect.\n\nMTV revamped the series in late 2018 for its YouTube channel. The overhauled format gave a more urban contemporary hip hop theme to the show. Incorporating a main social media aspect as well, the show features rapper Justina Valentine acting as host, with rapper Conceited as a cohost.\n\nOn June 4, 2019, it was announced that a reboot of the series will premiere in Spring 2020 on Quibi with Keke Palmer as the host.\n\nEach game began with one main contestant, the \"Picker\", being escorted onto the set blindfolded in front of the 50 potential dates in the \"Dating Pool\" while the announcer described him/her. The Picker was then led to a seat facing away from the Dating Pool and further divided from the potential dates by a wall.\n\nThe Picker was presented with a board showing six categories, which ranged from physical attributes to preferences in love-making to leisure activities. They generally were expressed in a humorous style, often with various pop-culture references. After choosing a category, two or three choices were listed (for example, a category on hair might be divided into blonde, brunette, and redhead), and the Picker was asked to eliminate one of the choices. After eliminating a choice, all the contestants who fit that choice left the Dating Pool, in view of the Picker. This process was repeated until five to eight potentials were left, at which point they advanced to the next round.\n\nIn the third season, a Golden Ticket was introduced, which allowed the Picker to save one eliminated player as he or she walked in front of him on the way out of the studio. This contestant automatically advanced to the semifinals. For episodes taped outside, the \"Golden Ticket\" was replaced with a Golden Lifesaver, with the same rules.\n\nAt that point, the Picker asked a series of questions which ranged from \"Dating Game\"–style questions (example, \"if you had me alone in a limousine for three hours, what would you do to me?\") to stunt-oriented questions (example, hitting a paddle ball a number of times, with the female host relaying the potential date's performance to the Picker). If the Picker was satisfied with the answer or performance, he or she would \"keep\" the contestant, advancing them to the final round. If the Picker was not satisfied, he or she would \"dump\" the contestant, eliminating him or her from further play. \"Dumped\" contestants were not shown to the Picker as in the first round, but were instead marked with some sort of prop, such as a toilet seat around the neck, a bag with a sad face on it on the male player's head, or a pageant sash labeled \"Dumped\". This round continued either until three contestants were \"kept,\" or all but three had been \"dumped.\" If the potential date received the golden ticket, then sometimes the host would show him or her to the picker.\n\nThe wall was removed from behind the Picker to reveal a walkway with several spaces behind him or her. The three finalists started on the back step, and were asked a series of two-choice questions. Each time a contestant's answer matched the Picker's, the player advanced one space on the walkway (occasionally, a question might be worth two steps). The first player to make it to the circle on which the Picker was sitting won a date with the Picker. In case of a tie, a final question was asked to the tying contestants, such as \"How many girls did (Picker's name) say he dated last year?\". The contestant who guessed the closest without going over won the date.\n\nAfter a couple had been made, the two contestants were placed back-to-back while Hardwick read a description of the winning player to the Picker. The contestants were then turned around to meet each other for the first time, and their trip and prizes were described to them by the announcer.\n\nTwo games were played per show, first with a woman picking from 50 single men, then with a man picking from 50 single women.\n\nBesides the hosts, the show also had mascot characters. The most prominent character was a scruffy, cigar-smoking cupid known as \"Bob the Angel\", who would sometimes appear in a series of vignettes with Hardwick and McCarthy. Bob would be joined by a wife, Roberta, and a son, Little Bob. Other characters included Fidel Castro, or an evangelist. These characters would often interact with the contestants during the \"Keep 'Em or Dump 'Em\" round, such as one male contestant being challenged to a game of tetherball against Castro. On rare occasions celebrities would appear. A female Picker claimed she was a Mel Torme fan and challenged a contestant to sing like him, only to have the real Torme come and judge his work.\n\nThe format in the 2018 revival is significantly different. The show has a main hip hop/urban contemporary theme, with a social media or Tinder motif as well. Also showcasing a more inclusive tolerance towards alternative lifestyles featuring LGBTQ segments as well.\n\nLikewise in the original version, \"The Picker\", is seated facing away from the audience. 50 other \"singles\" still compete for one person, however only 25 are genuine legitimate contestants in studio. Referred to as \"IRL\" contestants. (Keeping up the social media theme). The other 25 are \"URL\" contestants. (Which the show makes it seems they are competing via the internet, however all URL contestants are actually backstage. A still selfie of them are shown as avatars on a giant plasma screen, that the picker cannot see, situated next to the studio contestants.) They are essentially contestants as well, however not quite. The catch is, there is a possibility some (or possibly all), the URL contestants are illegitimate contestants, or to keep up with the show's theme, a Catfish. If a \"URL\" contestant is real, the selfie image on the screen is actually them and they are backstage. If a \"URL\" contestant is fake, their selfie is a stock image of an actor, and the \"URL\" contestant (who will be eventually revealed later) is essentially a catfish that during the reveal looks nothing like the image of them (which is usually embellished as person more conventionally attractive as them on the screen. Sometimes even a different gender. However catfish or otherwise, anything a \"URL\" does on the show is their own validity, and they are still a legitimate contestant).\n\nThe Picker was presented with a large board of six categories. Which narrowed down a contestants (whether IRL or URL) attributies. Anything from physical attraction, mental attraction, hobbies and social media habits. (Categories would have a humorous tone to them.) Once choosing a category two or three choices were listed (for example, a category on personality would be listed as \"Cray or Cray\" or \"Chill\"), and The Picker was asked to eliminate any contestant who falls under that trope. \"IRL\" contestants who were eliminated left the studio in view of the picker revealing themselves. (URL contestants are also eliminated likewise, however The Picker has no idea of this.) This continued until at least eight or less \"IRL\" contestants remained (which if less than eight \"IRL\" contestants were left, they would automatically advance to the next round) and/or eight or less \"URL\" contestants remained (which if less than eight \"URL\" were left on the screen, they would automatically advance to the next round.) who would then advance to Round 2.\n\nThe Picker who still has no idea who the \"IRL\" and URL\" contestants are, names are revealed and formally introduced and interviewed. (The \"URL\" contestants are still only represented by their selfie avatar, and a dating site like profile is instead shown.). At this time, The Picker is only allowed to choose one \"IRL\" and one \"URL\" contestant to move onto the following round. This is done by an activity or challenge The Picker asks the \"IRL\" contestants to do, and by various creative means for the \"URL\" contestants to do. (For example, The Picker may ask the \"URL\" contestants to post an emoji they think is cute etc. \"URL\" contestants although are still only represented by their selfie image, can still interact by text messages and also sending a voice message. However the chance of them being a catfish is still possible.) The eliminated \"IRL\" contestants walk out the studio and are revealed to The Picker. (The \"URL\" contestants are also eliminated with The Picker having no idea who they are.) Once one \"IRL\" and one \"URL\" contestant is left, they move onto the final round.\n\nThe Picker is now allowed to see the \"IRL\" contestant that is left, and they also see the selfie avatar image of the \"URL\" contestant on the plasma screen. To make the choice somewhat easier, an activity (which the winner/person who got the most matches isn't necessarily the one chosen by The Picker) done to get to know more about the \"IRL\" and \"URL\" contestants is played. Before the show, The Picker was given a survey on personality questions. (For example, \"kiss on first date or no?\"). These same questions are asked, and the \"IRL\" contestant would give their choice, (The \"URL\" contestant would send a text message of their answer). The Picker would raise a cue card of the choice they made earlier. If it was a match, the \"IRL\" and/or the \"URL\" contestant would get a point. After the questions are asked, The Picker then would have to make a choice. Either pick the \"IRL\" contestant in the studio, or go with the \"URL\" contestant (in which The Picker only knows them from their selfie avatar, with the possibility of them being a catfish.) The Picker would then make the choice, leading onto the reveal.\n\nImmediately after The Picker makes their choice, if they chose the \"IRL\" contestant, they would simply be matched together. However, if The Picker chose the \"URL\" contestant, they would then reveal themselves (in which they were backstage the entire time catfish or otherwise). If the \"URL\" contestant was not a catfish, they would be matched together as if they chose the \"IRL\" contestant. If the \"URL\" contestant is a catfish, The Picker usually is unhappy about this, however they can still decide to accept the catfish regardless.\n\nThe show served as the basis for a book: \"MTV's Singled Out Guide to Dating\" (MTV Books, 1996) by Lynn Harris and J.D. Heiman. This tie-in advice book was actually two books in one, a \"His\" side (with Chris Hardwick on the cover) and, turned over, a \"Hers\" side (with Jenny McCarthy on the cover). In this book, winning couples were interviewed about their dates.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1941607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941607", "title": "Bacha bazi", "text": "Bacha bazi\n\nBacha bāzī (, lit. \"boy play\"; from \"bacheh\", \"boy\", and \"bazi\" \"play, game\") is a slang term in some parts of Afghanistan for a wide variety of activities involving sexual relations between younger adolescent men or boys, who are called dancing boys, and older men. The custom is connected to sexual slavery and child prostitution. In the 21st century, Bacha bazi is reportedly practiced in various parts of Afghanistan. Force and coercion are common, and security officials state they are unable to end such practices because many of the men involved in bacha bazi-related activities are powerful and well-armed warlords.\n\nDuring the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), bacha bazi carried the death penalty under Taliban law. The practice of dancing boys is illegal under Afghan law, but the laws are seldom enforced against powerful offenders and police have reportedly been complicit in related crimes.\n\nA controversy arose after allegations surfaced that U.S. government forces in Afghanistan after the invasion of the country deliberately ignored bacha bazi. The U.S. military justified this by claiming the abuse was largely the responsibility of the \"local Afghan government\".<ref name=\"Washington Post 09/15\"></ref>\n\nAs of 2020, despite international concern, the practice continued.\n\nA number of Western travellers through Central Asia have reported on the phenomenon of the bacchá. Visiting Turkestan in 1872 to 1873, Eugene Schuyler observed that, \"here boys and youths specially trained take the place of the dancing-girls of other countries. The moral tone of the society of Central Asia is scarcely improved by the change\". His opinion was that the dances \"were by no means indecent, though they were often very lascivious\". At this date there were already signs of official disapproval of the practice. Wrote Schuyler:\nThese \"\"batchas\"\", or dancing-boys, are a recognised institution throughout the whole of the settled portions of Central Asia, though they are most in vogue in Bukhara and the neighbouring Samarkand. In the khanate of Khokand public dances have for some years been forbidden—the formerly licentious Khan having of late put on a semblance of morality and severity. ... In Tashkent \"batchas\" flourished until 1872, when a severe epidemic of cholera influenced the Mullahs to declare that dancing was against the precepts of the Koran, and at the request of the leaders of the native population, the Russian authorities forbade public dances during that summer.\n\nSchuyler remarked that the ban had barely lasted a year, so enthusiastic were the Sarts for a \"bazem\" \"dance\". He further describes the respect and affection the dancers often received:\n\nThese \"batchas\" are as much respected as the greatest singers and \"artistes\" are with us. Every movement they make is followed and applauded, and I have never seen such breathless interest as they excite, for the whole crowd seems to devour them with their eyes, while their hands beat time to every step. If a \"batcha\" condescends to offer a man a bowl of tea, the recipient rises to take it with a profound obeisance, and returns the empty bowl in the same way, addressing him only as \"Taxir\", 'your Majesty', or \"Kulluk\" 'I am your slave'. Even when a \"batcha\" passes through the bazaar all who know him rise to salute him with hands upon their hearts, and the exclamation of \"Kulluk\"! and should he deign to stop and rest in any shop, it is thought a great honour.\n\nHe also reports that a rich patron would often help establish a favourite dancer in business after he had grown too old to carry on his profession.\n\nCount Konstantin Konstantinovich Pahlen, during his travels through the area in 1908 and 1909, described such dances, and commissioned photographs of the dancers:\nIn 1909, two bacchá performed among the entertainers at the Central Asian Agricultural, Industrial and Scientific Exposition in Tashkent. Noting the public's constant interest in and laughter at the performance, several locally based researchers recorded the lyrics of the songs performed by the two boys (16-year-old Hadji-bacchá and 10-year-old Sayid-bacchá, both from the then Margilan uyezd). The songs were then published in the original \"Sart language\" (Uzbek) with a Russian translation. It waned in the big cities after World War I, for reasons that dance historian Anthony Shay describes as \"Victorian era prudery and [the] severe disapproval of colonial powers such as the Russians, British, and French, and the post-colonial elites who had absorbed those Western colonial values\".\n\nUnder the Taliban, bacha bazi was declared homosexual in nature, and therefore banned. The Taliban's opposition to bacha bazi was that they considered it incompatible with Sharia law, and outlawed the practice after coming to power in 1996. As with other homosexual activities, the charge carried the death penalty.\n\nClover Films and Afghan journalist Najibullah Quraishi made a documentary film titled \"The Dancing Boys of Afghanistan\" about the practice, which was shown in the UK in March 2010 and aired in the US the following month. Journalist Nicholas Graham of \"The Huffington Post\" lauded the documentary as \"both fascinating and horrifying\". The film won the 2011 Documentary award in the Amnesty International UK Media Awards. The film was broadcast on Channel 4's More4 service.\n\nThe issue has been covered by RAWA, Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan. The practice of bacha bazi prompted the United States Department of Defense to hire social scientist AnnaMaria Cardinalli to investigate the problem, as ISAF soldiers on patrol often passed older men walking hand-in-hand with young boys. British soldiers found that young Afghan men were trying to \"touch and fondle them\", which the soldiers did not understand.\n\nIn December 2010, a cable made public by WikiLeaks revealed that foreign contractors from DynCorp had spent money on bacha bazi in northern Afghanistan. Afghan Interior Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar requested that the U.S. military assume control over DynCorp training centres in response, but the U.S. embassy claimed that this was not \"legally possible under the DynCorp contract\".\n\nIn March 2011, \"The Documentary\" series on the BBC World Service addressed the concerns over the increased incidence of dancing boys and how this was at odds with the image which many wish to project about the post-Taliban future.\n\nIn December 2012, a young man in an \"improper relationship\" with a commander of the Afghan Border Police killed eight guards. He had made a drugged meal for the guards and then, with the help of two friends, attacked them, after which they fled to neighbouring Pakistan.\n\nIn a 2013 documentary by Vice Media titled \"This Is What Winning Looks Like\", British independent film-maker Ben Anderson describes the systematic kidnapping, sexual enslavement and murder of young men and boys by local security forces in the Afghan city of Sangin. The film depicts several scenes of Anderson along with American military personnel describing how difficult it is to work with the Afghan police considering the blatant molestation and rape of local youth. The documentary also contains footage of an American military advisor confronting the then-acting police chief on the abuse after a young boy is shot in the leg after trying to escape a police barracks. When the Marine suggests that the barracks be searched for children, and that any policeman found to be engaged in pedophilia be arrested and jailed, the high-ranking officer insists what occurs between the security forces and the boys is consensual, saying \"[the boys] like being there and giving their asses at night\". He went on to claim that this practice was historic and necessary, rhetorically asking: \"If [my commanders] don't fuck the asses of those boys, what should they fuck? The pussies of their own grandmothers?\"\n\nIn 2011, an Afghan mother in the Konduz province reported that her 12-year-old son had been chained to a bed and raped for two weeks by an Afghan Local Police (ALP) commander Abdul Rahman. When confronted, Rahman laughed and confessed. He was subsequently severely beaten by two U.S. Special Forces soldiers and thrown off the base. The soldiers were involuntarily separated from the military, but later reinstated after a lengthy legal case. As a direct result of this incident, legislation was created called the \"Mandating America's Responsibility to Limit Abuse, Negligence and Depravity\", or \"Martland Act\" named after Special Forces Sgt. 1st Class Charles Martland.\n\nIn 2015, \"The New York Times\" reported that U.S. soldiers serving in Afghanistan were instructed by their commanders to ignore child sexual abuse being carried out by Afghan security forces, except \"when rape is being used as a weapon of war\". American soldiers have been instructed not to intervene—in some cases, not even when their Afghan allies have abused boys on military bases, according to interviews and court records. But the U.S. soldiers have been increasingly troubled that instead of weeding out pedophiles, the U.S. military was arming them against the Taliban and placing them as the police commanders of villages—and doing little when they began abusing children.\n\nAccording to a report published in June 2017 by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, the US military reported 5753 cases of \"gross human rights abuses\" by Afghan forces, many of which related to sexual abuse. According to \"The New York Times\", discussing that report, American law required military aid to be cut off to the offending unit, but that never happened. US Special Forces officer, Capt. Dan Quinn, was relieved of his command in Afghanistan after fighting an Afghan militia commander who had been responsible for keeping a boy as a sex slave.\n\nThe media coverage of this phenomenon is stable and there were reports about bacha bazi during 2016 and 2017.\n\nIn the 2003 fictional novel \"The Kite Runner\", by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini, and in the 2007 movie of the same name, the practice of bacha bazi is depicted. In the plot, the protagonist Amir's half-nephew is forced to become a dancing boy and sexual slave to a high-ranking official of the Taliban government. The same official had, years earlier, raped the boy's father when he was a pre-teen and the official was a teenager, but Amir manages to free the boy and takes him away from Afghanistan to start a new life in the United States.\n\n\n"}

It and the suborder Caelifera (grasshoppers and their allies) make up the order Orthoptera. Ensifera is believed to be a more ancient group than Caelifera, with its origins in the Carboniferous period, the split having occurred at the end of the Permian period. Unlike the Caelifera, the Ensifera contain numerous members that are partially carnivorous, feeding on other insects as well as plants.\n\n\"Ensifer\" is Latin for \"sword bearer\", and refers to the typically elongated and blade-like ovipositor of the females.\n\nCharacteristics shared by the two orthopteran suborders, Caelifera and Ensifera, are the mouthparts adapted for biting and chewing, the modified prothorax, the hind legs modified for jumping, the wing shape and venation and the sound-producing stridulatory organs.\n\nEnsiferans are distinguished from Caeliferans by their elongated, threadlike antennae, which are often longer than the length of their body and have over thirty segments (except in the subterranean \"Cooloolidae\" family). In the families in which the males sing, the forewings have modifications which include toothed veins and scrapers for making the noise, and the surrounding membranous areas amplify the sound. In these groups, the sound-detecting tympanal organs are located on the tibiae of the front legs. The tarsi have three segments and the ovipositor is blade-like or needle-like. The male attaches the spermatophore externally to the female's gonopore. The spermatophore is often surrounded by a proteinaceous spermatophylax, the function of which is to provide a nutritional nuptial gift to the female.\n\nThe Orthoptera Species File database lists the following superfamilies and families.\n\nThe phylogenetic relationships of the Ensifera, summarized by Darryl Gwynne in 1995 from his own work and that of earlier authors, are shown in the following cladogram, with the Orthoptera divided into two main groups, Ensifera and Caelifera (grasshoppers). Fossil Ensifera are found from the late Carboniferous period onwards.\n\nThe oldest known fossil in the Archaeorthoptera, the crown group of the Orthoptera, and also the oldest member of the Pterygota (winged insects), is from the Namurian (324 mya) Lower Carboniferous beds in the Upper Silesian Basin of the Czech Republic.\n\n"}

He would use several pseudonyms, posing as a professional photographer to lure his victims with the promise of a modelling career.\n\nBorn in the Bronx to a Jewish family and raised in Colorado, Glatman exhibited antisocial behavior and sadomasochistic sexual tendencies from an early age.

{"id": "1941663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941663", "title": "I Lombardi alla prima crociata", "text": "I Lombardi alla prima crociata\n\nI Lombardi alla Prima Crociata (\"The Lombards on the First Crusade\") is an operatic \"dramma lirico\" in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Temistocle Solera, based on an epic poem by Tommaso Grossi, which was \"very much a child of its age; a grand historical novel with a patriotic slant\". Its first performance was given at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 11 February 1843. Verdi dedicated the score to Maria Luigia, the Habsburg Duchess of Parma, who died a few weeks after the premiere. In 1847, the opera was significantly revised to become Verdi's first grand opera for performances in France at the Salle Le Peletier of the Paris Opera under the title of \"Jérusalem\".\n\nGrossi's original epic poem had plot complications that required the librettist to make significant changes; the historical characters portrayed in the original do not appear and the story becomes that of a fictional family and its involvement in the First Crusade. Julian Budden's analysis of the opera's origins notes: \"In 1843 any subject where Italians were shown united against a common enemy was dangerous, especially in Austrian Milan. Yet strangely enough it was not the police but the church that took exception to \"I Lombardi\"\", since the Archbishop of Milan had heard rumours that the work contained specific elements of Catholic ritual. However, given Verdi's refusal to make any changes to the music, it is fortunate that the result of the police chief's investigations of the archbishops complaints required only very minor alterations.\n\nWhile the premiere performance was a popular success, critical reactions were less enthusiastic and inevitable comparisons were made with \"Nabucco\". However, one writer noted: \"If [\"Nabucco\"] created this young man's reputation, \"I Lombardi\" served to confirm it.\". Budden himself disagrees with this contemporary view, noting that \"\"Nabucco\" is all of a piece, a unity, however crude; \"I Lombardi\" is an agglomeration of heterogeneous ideas, some remarkable, some unbelievably banal.\"\n\nBudden notes that \"for many years \"I Lombardi\" enjoyed the same kind of popularity as \"Nabucco\", but he states that it did not fare well in Venice the following year and that it received few performances outside of Italy. However, within Italy, the opera was presented in Lucca in the summer of 1843, in Florence and Lucca in the autumn, and during the 1843/44 carnival season it was given in Trieste and Turin, while performances in 1845 were presented in Bologna and later, in the 1845/46 season, in Palermo and Mantua, in Macerata in the summer of 1846 and various other cities well in to the 1850s. Even in the late 1880s, well after \"Jérusalem\" had been given, it was presented in Florence.\n\nThis \"was the first of Verdi's operas to be heard in the United States, at Palmo's Opera House\", on 3 March 1847 in New York. In the prior year the opera's British premiere had taken place on 12 May 1846 at Her Majesty's Theatre in London, Verdi having been invited there by the theatre's impresario, Benjamin Lumley: \"...I will go to London to write an opera\" he had written, but in the end, illness prevented him from doing so.\n\nHowever, with Italy approaching unification in the 1850s and in the decade following it in 1861, \"I Lombardi\" 's call to peoples' patriotic instincts seemed to keep it alive, albeit that, by 1865 when Arrigo Boito saw a performance, he remarked that the opera was beginning to show its age.\n\n\"I Lombardi\" was presented in 1930 at La Scala in Milan as the season's opening production.\n\n\"I Lombardi\" was given by the Opera Orchestra of New York in a concert version under the direction of Eve Queler at Carnegie Hall, New York, on July 12, 1972. Soloists included José Carreras, Renata Scotto, and Paul Plishka. \n\nThe opera was presented at the Royal Opera House in 1976 with José Carreras, Sylvia Sass and Nicola Ghiuselev as well as the same year by the Bilbao-based ABAO company. The cast included Matteo Manuguerra, Cristina Deutekom, Juan Pons, as well as Carreras.\n\nCarlo Bergonzi and Paul Plishka, along with Cristina Deutekom appeared in the San Diego Opera's short-lived (1979 to 1984) summer \"Verdi Festival\" in June 1979 and it is claimed that this was a West Coast premiere. Over the years, New York audiences have seen the opera presented first by New York City Opera in 1982. Six years later, \"I Lombardi\" was given by the Opera Orchestra of New York in a concert version with Aprile Millo in April 1986 and this was followed by the first performances at the Metropolitan Opera as part of its 1993/94 season with Luciano Pavarotti, Aprile Millo, and Samuel Ramey in some of the major roles.\n\n\"I Lombardi\" was presented at the Teatro Donizetti in Bergamo in late 2001 with Dimitra Theodossiou in the cast. The Teatro Regio di Parma produced it in January 2009, also as part of a complete Verdi cycle. The Parma performance is preserved on a DVD. Sarasota Opera's \"Verdi Cycle\" featured the opera during its 2011 season. Hamburg State Opera presented a production by David Alden as part of a mini-festival of three Verdi operas in October/November 2013.\n\n\"Scene 1: A square outside the church of Sant' Ambrogio in Milan\"\n\nThe two sons of Lord Folco, Pagano and Arvino, are reconciled, having previously feuded over which man would win the hand of Viclinda. Pagano, who once threatened the life of his brother, has returned from exile. A throng gathers in front of the church of Sant'Ambrogio to celebrate. Viclinda, now Arvino's wife, and their daughter Giselda are on hand to witness the reconciliation. A crusade to the Holy Land is announced and Arvino is to lead it. Pagano secretly vents his enduring frustration to Pirro, Arvino's squire: he still desires Viclinda (\"Sciagurata! hai tu creduto\" / \"Wretched woman! Did you believe that I could forget you...\"). As nuns sing in the background, Pirro and a gang of cut-throats agree to help Pagano take Viclinda for himself.\n\n\"Scene 2: The Folco palace\"\n\nViclinda and Giselda are concerned about Pagano and his supposed reformation. Arvino asks them to watch his elderly father, Lord Folco, who is spending the night in Arvino's chambers. Giselda prays (Aria: \"Salve Maria\" / \"Hail Mary!\"). Pirro and Pagano and their assassins storm the palace. Pagano draws his sword and enters Arvino's chambers. He emerges with a bloody sword and with Viclinda in his custody. Arvino suddenly appears and Pagano is shocked to learn that in the darkness he has killed his father, not his brother (\"Orror!\" / \"Horror! Dreadful monster of Hell...\"). A throng calls for Pagano's death, but Giselda protests against more bloodshed. So Pagano is once again sent into exile.\n\n\"Scene 1: Acciano's palace in Antioch\"\n\nAcciano and representatives from surrounding territories plot their continued resistance to the marauding crusaders. They have captured Giselda, who is now held captive within Acciano's harem. Sofia, Acciano's head wife and a secret Christian, enters with her son Oronte. Oronte has fallen in love with the captive Giselda (Aria: \"La mia letizia infondere\" / \"Would that I could instill my gladness into her dear heart\"). As Oronte sings of his love, Sofia sees Giselda as a means of converting her son to Christianity (\"Come poteva un angelo\" / \"How could Heaven create an angel so pure\").\n\n\"Scene 2: A cave in the desert outside Antioch\"\n\nA hermit waits for the arrival of the crusaders. A man appears at the cave and asks the hermit how he may receive forgiveness for his past sins. The man is Pirro, who has become a confidante of Acciano and now controls the gates of Antioch. The hermit counsels Pirro that he will achieve forgiveness if he opens the gates to the approaching crusaders. Thereafter, the crusaders, led by Arvino, appear at the cave. The hermit learns that Arvino's daughter has been captured by Acciano. The hermit assures them that they will succeed in taking Antioch.\n\n\"Scene 3: Acciano's harem\"\n\nThe members of the harem sing of Giselda's luck in attracting the attentions of Oronte. As Giselda prays (Aria: \"Oh madre, dal cielo\" / \"O mother, from heaven hear my lament\") sudden shouts warn that the crusaders have invaded Antioch. Sofia rushes in to say that both Acciano and Oronte have been killed. Arvino enters with the hermit. Sofia identifies Arvino as the murderer of her husband and son. Giselda is horrified and recoils at her father's attempted embrace. She declares that this crusade was not the will of God. Arvino draws his sword and threatens to kill her for her blasphemy, but he is stopped by the hermit and Sofia. Arvino declares that his daughter has gone mad.\n\n\"Scene 1: The valley of Jehoshaphat; Jerusalem is in the distance\"\n\nThe crusaders, joined by Christian pilgrims, sing of the beauty of Jerusalem and the Holy Land. Giselda has wandered away from her father's camp. Suddenly, Oronte appears! He was merely wounded, not killed, by Arvino's sword. Giselda and Oronte decide to flee together (Duet: \"Oh belle, a questa misera\" / \"O Lombard tents, fair to this unhappy girl, farewell!\").\n\n\"Scene 2: Arvino's tent\"\n\nArvino rages against his daughter's betrayal. Soldiers arrive to tell him that Pagano has been seen in camp and they call for his capture and death. Arvino agrees.\n\n\"Scene 3: A grotto near the River Jordan\"\n\nAfter a violin prelude, Giselda and Oronte appear. Oronte has been wounded and Giselda bitterly laments God's cruelty. The hermit appears. He tells Giselda and Oronte that their love is sinful but may be purified by Oronte's conversion and baptism. The hermit completes the baptism, and Giselda laments as Oronte dies from his wounds, promising to see her in heaven (Trio: \"Qual voluttà trascorrere\" / \"What wondrous pleasure I feel\").\n\n\"Scene 1: A cave, near Jerusalem\"\n\nAs Giselda dreams, Oronte appears to her in a vision and tells her that God has granted his prayer: the crusaders will find strength in the waters of the fountain of Siloam (Aria: \"In cielo benedetto\" / \"Through you, Giselda, I am blessed in heaven\"). Giselda wakes and sings of her miraculous vision (Aria: \"Qual prodigio ... Non fu sogno!\" / \"A miracle!... It was not a dream\").\n\n\"Scene 2: The Lombards' tents\"\n\nThe crusaders and pilgrims are despairing that God has abandoned them in the desert (\"O signore, dal tetto natio\" / \"O Lord, Thou dids't call us\"). Giselda rushes in, announcing the discovery of a spring of water. As all rejoice, Arvino assures his crusaders of his confidence that they will now take Jerusalem.\n\n\"Scene 3: Arvino's tent\"\nDying from wounds, the hermit is brought in by Giselda and Arvino. The hermit reveals that he is really Pagano. In his dying moments, he confesses to Arvino his penitence for their father's murder and begs forgiveness. Arvino embraces his brother, and Pagano asks for a final view of the Holy City. As Jerusalem appears in the distance, Pagano dies, and the crusaders praise heaven (\"Te lodiamo, gran Dio di vittoria\" / \"We praise Thee, great God of Victory\").\n\nRousing choruses, vocal ensembles with the varying characters differentiated through the music, and marches with the stage band are a feature of this work. The chorus \"O Signore, dal tetto natio\", like its counterpart the Chorus of Hebrew Slaves in Verdi's previous opera \"Nabucco\" became extremely and deservedly popular. There is an unusually extended orchestral introduction with solo violin in three sections before the \"Baptism\" trio \"Qual voluttà trascorrere\" with the solo violin also prominent in the closing section of that trio. The character of Giselda comes across with striking individuality due to the music Verdi composed for her.\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n\n"}

As part of the Potomac River watershed, it is an American Heritage River.\n\nThe Cacapon River Watershed is made up of three major river segments and many smaller stream watersheds. The headwaters of the Cacapon River, known as the Lost River, is long and receives water from a watershed covering . The largest tributary of the Cacapon is the North River, which drains , an area comparable to that of the Lost River. Overall, the Cacapon River watershed includes the Lost and North River watersheds, and those of many smaller streams for a total of . The Cacapon watershed is itself part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed.\n\nIn recent years the Cacapon River and its watershed have become threatened by development, and industrial and agricultural growth. Concern about these issues led to the establishment of the Cacapon Institute in 1985 (originally known as the Pine Cabin Run Ecological Laboratory).\n\nThe Cacapon River emerges from underground in a gap in Sandy Ridge (1683 feet/513 m) west of Wardensville. It is actually the reemergence of the Lost River, which sinks into an underground channel east of McCauley near the entrance to Camp Pinnacle. From its emergence, the Cacapon River creates a horseshoe bend shaped gap through Sandy Ridge and flows east paralleling West Virginia Route 55/West Virginia Route 259 to its north. At Wardensville, the river is joined by Trout Run and then curves northeastward where it meanders through an expansive valley plain. Here, it is fed by Slate Rock Run and then Moores Run further north. Waites Run, a tributary draining some of the western slopes of Great North Mountain enters the Cacapon River near the bridge on Rt. 55, north of Wardensville. Shortly after its confluence with Sine Run, the Cacapon River continues north into Hampshire County.\n\nFrom the county line, the river is bounded to its east by the George Washington National Forest and to its west by Baker Mountain (2024 feet/617 m). Throughout this stretch, the Cacapon River is also joined by sections of the old Winchester and Western Railroad grade. It continues its meandering course northeastward, flowing past the community of Intermont and Hebron Church. At Capon Lake, the river is joined by Capon Springs Run and is the site of the historic Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge. West Virginia Route 259 parallels the Cacapon River to its west along the eastern flank of Baker Mountain until the road turns east across the Kenneth Seldon Bridge at Yellow Spring. From Yellow Spring Gap, the river is fed by a run whose source is the \"Yellow Spring\".\n\nThe Cacapon River moves north along the eastern flank of Cacapon Mountain (1913 feet/583 m) with Cacapon River Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 14) paralleling it to its west. From Yellow Spring, the river flows by Camps Rim Rock and White Mountain. After another immense horseshoe bend, the Cacapon River moves past the communities of Hooks Mills and Bubbling Spring and is joined by Old Man Run and Kale Hollow's run. The river's stretch through Bubbling Spring is a popular location for summer river camps which consist of cottages, trailers, and campers on narrow river lots. This stretch of the Cacapon River is also the scene for numerous old plantation houses including the Captain David Pugh House (\"Riversdell\") at Hooks Mills, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nNorth of Kale Hollow, the Cacapon River is joined to its west by Dillons Mountain (1913 feet/583 m). To its east, the river is paralleled by Christian Church Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 13), on which is located the 18th century Capon Chapel. After its confluence with Mill Branch, the Cacapon River bends through the small historic town of Capon Bridge. It is met by Dillons Run from its west and traversed by a bridge of the Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50), from which Capon Bridge takes its name. From Capon Bridge, the Cacapon River is bounded to its east by Bear Garden Mountain (1572 feet/479 m). It is then joined by Edwards Run and Cold Stream near the community of Cold Stream.\n\nThe river meanders north around Darbys Nose (1287 feet/392 m), flanked to its east by Leith Mountain (1598 feet/487 m). The stretch of the Cacapon River between Cold Stream and Forks of Cacapon is mountainous and forested with little development. It meanders through a series of mountain ridges, on one of which, Castle Mountain (1260 feet/384 m), sits the Caudy's Castle rock outcrop. Bloomery Pike (West Virginia Route 127) passes over the river where it is met by Bloomery Run east of Forks of Cacapon. North of Bloomery Pike lies the actual \"Forks of Cacapon\" where the Cacapon and North Rivers converge. From Forks of Cacapon to Largent, the river creates a number of horseshoe bends between Sideling Hill (2021 feet/616 m) and Little Mountain (1429 feet/435 m). This stretch of the Cacapon River is also mostly undeveloped and forested with the exception of a gated community, The Crossings, located between the WV 127 bridge and Largent.\n\nThe Cacapon River meanders into Morgan County at Largent where Cacapon Road (West Virginia Route 9) passes over it and the river is met by Stony Creek. It continues its meandering course northeast between Sideling Hill and Little Mountain until Fisher's Bridge where it is joined to its east by the western flanks of Cacapon Mountain. Tonoloway Ridge (992 feet/302 m) then bounds the Cacapon River to its west until it reaches the railroad hamlet of Great Cacapon. After passing under the WV 9 and old Baltimore and Ohio Railroad bridges, the Cacapon River joins the Potomac.\nCacapon is a name derived from the Shawnee language meaning \"medicine water\".\n\nThe Board on Geographic Names decided on \"Cacapon River\" in 1916 as the river's official name and spelling.

Likely due to its strong usage of Japanese, the series has remained confined to Japan. The \"Kotoba no Puzzle\" series was met with positive reviews from critics, being praised for its originality, multiplayer and addictive gameplay, with \"Kotoba no Puzzle: Mojipittan DS\" receiving the \"Gold Hall of Fame\" award from \"Famitsu\".\n\n\"Mojipittan\" is similar in play to the word game \"Scrabble\". The player uses tiles with hiragana to build words. The player may take turns against the computer or a human opponent or play alone. Unlike \"Scrabble\", however, each player may place only one tile per turn as opposed to multiple tiles in the former. Tiles must be placed next to any other tile on the board, space permitting, but at least one word must be formed with each tile placed; as long as these conditions are met, a tile may be placed anywhere on the board, even if not all of the other tiles a new tile is connected to form new words.\n\nA major difference in how the game plays in contrast with \"Scrabble\" is that words do not need to be isolated.\n\nFor example, in the play pictured above, with the bold letter う (\"u\") being played, in addition to つうか (\"tsuuka,\" either 通過, meaning \"passing\", or 通貨, meaning \"currency\"), つう (通 or \"tsuu\", meaning \"connoisseur\") and うか (羽化 or \"uka\", meaning \"eclosion\") qualify as words. The horizontal words that qualify in this play are ふつう (普通 or \"futsuu\", meaning \"normal\"), つうち (通知 or \"tsuuchi\", meaning \"notification\"), and うち (内 or \"uchi\", meaning \"inside\"), as well as つう again. Forming multiple words with the placement of a single tile is termed a \"chain\".\n\nStages have objectives such as \"fill all the spots on the board\", \"create twenty words over three tiles long\", or \"create chains of three, eight times\". The board always have pre-existing tiles that players have to work with.\n\nA board game adaptation called was made by Mega House under Bandai Namco's license and released in 2007.\n\nOn release, Famitsu scored \"Mojipittan DS\" a 33 out of 40 (9/8/8/8).\n\n"}

Development of the aircraft was started in the 1990s, and its maiden flight took place on 17 December 2004. The aircraft completed its certification programme on 26 February 2007. The An-148 has a maximum range of and is able to carry 68–85 passengers, depending on the configuration.\n\nThe Antonov An-158 is a stretched fuselage version of the aircraft, accommodating up to 100 passengers.\n\nFollowing a crash in February 2018, all An-148 and An-158 in Russia were grounded by the Russian Ministry of Transport. In addition, Cubana grounded its An-158 fleet as of May 2018 due to several technical issues with the aircraft. Until late 2018, the Antonov An-148 aircraft was also being produced in Russia by Voronezh Aircraft Production Association, however due to the souring political relationship between Ukraine and Russia, production in Russia was discontinued. The last Russian-built An-148 was completed in October 2018.\n\nThe An-148 aircraft is a high-wing monoplane with two turbofan jet engines mounted in pods under the wing. This arrangement protects the engines and wing structure against foreign object damage. A built-in autodiagnosis system, auxiliary power unit, and the wing configuration allow the An-148 to be used at poorly equipped airfields. Flight and navigation equipment features five liquid crystal display panels built by Russia's Aviapribor and a fly-by-wire system, which enables the An-148 aircraft to operate day and night, under instrument flight rules and visual flight rules weather conditions on high-density air routes. Similar to the Boeing 737, the main landing gear rotates into the belly of the aircraft when in flight, with partial doors covering the legs, and the sides of the tires remaining exposed. Built-in entrance stairs enable boarding and disembarking the aircraft without extra ground equipment. The manufacturer claims high fuel efficiency of the Motor Sich D-436-148 engines.\n\nThe beginning of the An-148 project dates to the early 1990s, when work on the Antonov An-74 passenger modification started, headed by Petro Balabuev. In 2001, the project was renamed An-148. The An-74 fuselage was extended and the new aircraft's wing design was created from scratch. The developers initially used Motor Sich D-436-148 engines. Other variants with Western-made engines with thrust of (such as the General Electric CF34 or Rolls-Royce BR700) are being considered.\n\nIn 2002, production of the first three prototypes was begun at AVIANT. On 17 December 2004, the first prototype completed its maiden flight. The second prototype joined the testing programme in April 2005. During the certification programme, the two prototypes performed about 600 flights in total. On 26 February 2007, the aircraft, its D-436-148 engine and the AI-450-МS auxiliary power unit were certified by the Interstate Aviation Committee of Russia and the State Aviation Administration of Ukraine.\n\nThe An-148 is manufactured by the Ukrainian Kiev AVIANT plant (now Antonov Serial Production Plant) and Russia's Voronezh Aircraft Production Association (VASO). On 28 June 2009, the first serially produced An-148, manufactured at VASO in Voronezh, took to the skies. Although numerous companies are involved in the project, at least 70% of the aircraft's hardware is made by Russian manufacturers. The An-148's list price is about $24–30 million. The main problem with the project has been increasing the aircraft's sluggish production rate. The then-independent AVIANT plant initially failed to satisfy to growing orders, leading to VASO's growing involvement in the aircraft's assembly. VASO announced in June 2017 that the two final Russian-assembled An-148s would be delivered, and the project would not see further development.\n\nThe An-148-100 regional aircraft is the main model of the An-148. It seats 70 passengers at or up to 80 passengers at pitch in a one-class 2+3 seating layout. The aircraft is also configurable in a multiple-class layout which can carry fewer passengers, typically with four abreast business class.\n\nFor Siberian operators, Antonov plans a model with a higher gross weight and additional fuel capacity in the center tank, extending the range with 75 passengers from to . An \"E\" variant is also planned to offer a special range, which would serve as a platform for the \"E1\", capable of non-stop Moscow-Vladivostok services carrying 44 passengers.\n\n\nIn April 2005, the Ilyushin Finance Leasing Company ordered the first series of An-148 for the Krasair airline. Lease agreement calls for ten aircraft with an option for five units valued at $270 million.\n\nOn 2 June 2009, the first An-148 entered commercial service with the Ukrainian carrier Aerosvit. The first passenger flight was from Kharkiv to Kiev; the aircraft had the civilian registration \"UR-NTA\". By November 2009, Aerosvit was operating the An-148 on the Kiev–Odessa and Simferopol–Lviv routes, performing two flights a day with the average flight time of 4–5 hours.\n\nOn 21 December 2009, the An-148 was put into service in Russia with Rossiya airline. The first passenger flight was FV135 from Pulkovo Airport in Saint Petersburg to Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow. By 20 May 2010, Rossiya's An-148 fleet had accumulated a total of 915 flight hours and performed 710 landings. Rossiya complained that the aircraft experienced some reliability problems. There were some technical problems with the aircraft, and pilot training could not be ramped up fast enough, leading to pilot shortages. However, by 2011 the situation had improved.\n\nOn 15 February 2010, the An-148 started international flights to the European Union (Poland) with the Aerosvit airline.\n\nOn 18 April 2013, the first serial An-158 version was delivered to the Cuban flagship airline Cubana de Aviación. According to Antonov, Cubana additionally ordered two more aircraft, while other sources report this order to be for ten aircraft.\n\nOn 28 April 2013, Ukraine's Antonov aircraft maker handed over a third An-158 passenger airliner to Cuba and signed a contract for the delivery of three more.\n\nThe Russian ambassador in Bolivia and the government of Evo Morales are negotiating the acquisition of one aircraft of this type for use as the presidential carrier and another eight for the state-owned airlines: Boliviana de Aviación (BoA) and Transporte Aéreo Militar (TAM).\n\nIn April 2016, Indian company Reliance defense limited and Antonov entered into an agreement to construct an aircraft based on An 148/ An 158 for defense and commercial purposes.\n\nIn April 2017, Cubana de Aviación suspended its flights between Havana and Guantánamo due to \"technical problems\" with its An-158 fleet. The route from Havana to Holguín also had problems: of 116 planned flights in the first months of 2017, 38 were cancelled and 36 suffered significant delays. Yoanka Acosta, head of Cubana's commercial division, explained that the planes were leased from Ukraine but spare parts were sourced from Russia, so the state of conflict between the two countries had affected the supply of parts, making maintenance difficult. In late April, however, representatives from Antonov and Cubana met and signed a service agreement that extended the aircraft's navigation directives to 3,600 flights and guaranteed the supply of spare parts, although it did not specify a date for normalization.\n\nIn March 2018 Rostransnadzor suspended all flights of An-148 in Russia after crash on 11 February 2018.\n\nIn May 2018, Cubana de Aviación grounded its An-158 fleet after it received an order from the Cuban National Aviation Authority. The official reason given by the Cuban National Aviation Authority was \"multiple and repeating failures have been found in complex systems, built by mechanical, hydraulic and electrical components, as well as computer performance algorithms\", in addition to \"evidence of design and manufacturing flaws, serious issues in flight control system, cracks in the structure and engine temperature increase above normal parameters\".\n\nSources: Antonov Design Bureau, United Aircraft Corporation, flightglobal.com, Aviant.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1941706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941706", "title": "Corfu incident", "text": "Corfu incident\n\nThe Corfu incident was a 1923 diplomatic and military crisis between Greece and Italy. It was triggered when an Italian general heading a commission to resolve a border dispute between Albania and Greece was murdered in Greek territory along with members of his staff. In response, Benito Mussolini issued a severe ultimatum to Greece and when it was not accepted in whole, dispatched forces to bombard and occupy Corfu. Mussolini defied the League of Nations and stated Italy would leave if it arbitrated in the crisis, and the Conference of Ambassadors instead eventually tendered an agreement favoring Italy. This was an early demonstration of the League's weakness when dealing with larger powers.\n\nDuring the Italo-Ottoman war of 1911-12, Italy had occupied the Dodecanese islands whose population was largely Greek. Under the Venizelos–Tittoni agreement of 1919, Italy promised to cede the Dodecanese islands except for Rhodes to Greece in exchange for Greek recognition of the Italian claims to part of Anatolia. However, the victories of the Turkish nationalist movement had put an end to all plans for partitioning Asia Minor by 1922, and Mussolini took the view that since the Italians had been forced out of Turkey that cancelled out the obligation to cede the Dodecanese islands to Greece. The Greeks continued to press Mussolini on the Dodecanese issue, and in the summer of 1923, he ordered the Italian garrison in the Dodecaneses reinforced as part of his plans to formally annex the islands to Italy, which caused Greece to issue notes of protest.\n\nIn May 1923, during a visit to Rome, the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Curzon, told Mussolini that Britain would cede Jubaland and Jarabub to Italy as part of a general settlement of all of Italy's claims, saying that Italians had to settle their disputes with both Yugoslavia and Greece as part of the price of Jubaland and Jarabub. Under the terms of the Treaty of London, under which Italy entered the First World War in 1915, Britain had promised to cede Jubaland and Jarabub to Italy, and as Mussolini had founded the Fascist Party in 1919 in part to protest the \"mutilated victory\" of 1918 as Italy did not obtain all of the territory promised by the Treaty of London, Jubaland and Jarabub had over-sized symbolic importance in Italy far out of proportion to the actual value of these territories. To obtain Jubaland and Jarabub would mean that Italy would have to settle the Fiume dispute with Yugoslavia and the Dodecanese islands dispute with Greece, neither of which Mussolini wanted to compromise on. Through the Milner-Scialoja agreement of 1920 had committed Britain to cede Jubaland and Jarabub to Italy, the British had subsequently tied that to the Italians settling the Dodecanese islands dispute first. Under the treaty of Lausanne in July 1923, all of the Allied powers abandoned their claims to Turkey, which badly damaged Mussolini's prestige as he promised as an opposition leader to obtain all of the territories the Italians had fought for in World War I including a large chunk of Anatolia. Having denounced his predecessors as weak leaders who had brought about the \"mutilated victory\" of 1918 and promised that he was a \"strong leader\" who would undo the \"mutilated victory\", Mussolini by the summer of 1923 was to face the reality that Italy was simply too weak to achieve all of his promises.\n\nThere was a boundary dispute between Greece and Albania. The two nations took their dispute to the Conference of Ambassadors, which created a commission of British, French, and Italian officials to determine the boundary, which was authorized by the League of Nations to settle the dispute. The Italian General Enrico Tellini became the chairman of the commission.\nFrom the outset of the negotiations, the relations between Greece and the commission were bad. Eventually the Greek delegate openly accused Tellini of working in favour of Albania's claims.\n\nIn July 1923, Mussolini had ordered the admirals of the \"Regia Marina\" to start preparing for the occupation of Corfu, which he predicated would happen that summer in response to the \"\"expected\" provocative acts\" by Greece. The Italian Navy minister, Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, welcomed the plan to seize Corfu for budgetary reasons, believing a triumph by the \"Regia Marina\" would show the Italian people the importance of the navy and thus lead to a bigger naval budget. At the same time, Mussolini did not inform the professional diplomats of the Palazzo Chigi about his plans to seize Corfu, expecting them to object, an expectation that was confirmed when Corfu was indeed bombarded.\n\nOn August 27, 1923, Tellini, two of his aides, their interpreter and a chauffeur fell into an ambush and were assassinated by unknown assailants at the border crossing of Kakavia, which is near the town of Ioannina, within Greek territory. The five victims were Tellini, Major Luigi Corti, Lieutenant Mario Bonacini, Albanian interpreter Thanas Gheziri and the chauffeur Remigio Farnetti. None of the victims were robbed. \nThe incident occurred close to the disputed border and therefore could have been carried out by either side.\n\nAccording to Italian newspapers and the official statement of the Albanian government, the attack was carried out by Greeks, while other sources, including the Greek government and its officials and the Romanian consul in Ioannina, attributed the murder to Albanian bandits. In April 1945, the British Ambassador to Greece, Reginald Leeper, sent a letter to British Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden that expressed the viewpoint that it was the Cham Albanians who were responsible for the murder of General Tellini. The letter stated that a Cham Albanian bandit named Daout Hodja [Daut Hohxa] killed General Tellini and the other officers. Summarising the most recent evidence, the Greek historian Aristotle Kallis wrote: \"Much about the incident which resulted in Tellini's assassination remains unclear. There is sufficient evidence to lend credence to the Greek government's argument that the perpetrators had in fact originated from Albania and had crossed the border illegally to ambush the car inside Greece and thus inculpate the Greek side\".\n\nUpon news of the murder, anti-Greek demonstrations broke out in Italy. The Greek newspapers were reported by Australian newspapers to \"condemn unanimously the Tellini crime, and express friendly sentiments towards Italy. They hope that the Cabinet will give legitimate satisfaction to Italy without going beyond the limits of national dignity.\"\n\nItaly sent an ultimatum to Greece on August 29, 1923, demanding: (1) a complete official apology at the Italian legation in Athens, (2) a solemn funeral in the Catholic cathedral in Athens in the presence of all the Greek government, (3) military honours for the bodies of the victims, (4) full honours by the Greek fleet to the Italian fleet which would be sent to Piraeus, (5) capital punishment for the guilty, (6) an indemnity of 50 million lire within five days of receipt of the note and (7) a strict inquiry, to be carried out quickly with the assistance of the Italian military attaché. In addition, Italy demanded that Greece must reply to the ultimatum within 24 hours.\n\nGreece replied to Italy on August 30, 1923, accepting four of the demands which with modifications were as follows: (1) The commandant of Piraeus would express the Greek Government's sorrow to the Italian Minister, (2) a memorial service will be held in the presence of members of the government, (3) on the same day a detachment of the guard would salute the Italian flag at the Italian legation, (4) the military would render honors to the remains of the victims when they were transferred to an Italian warship. The other demands were rejected on the ground that they would infringe the sovereignty and honor of Greece. In addition, the Greek government declared its complete willingness to grant, as a measure of justice, an equitable indemnity to the families of the victims, and that it didn't accept an enquiry in the presence of the Italian military attaché but it would be pleased to accept any assistance which Colonel Perone (the Italian military attaché) might be able to lend by supplying any information likely to facilitate the discovery of the assassins.\n\nMussolini and the Italian cabinet were not satisfied with the reply of the Greek government and declared that it was unacceptable. The Italian press, including the opposition journals, endorsed Mussolini's demands and insisted that Greece must comply without discussion. Mussolini's decision was received with enthusiasm in all of Italy.\n\nOn August 31, 1923, a squadron of the Italian Navy bombarded the Greek island of Corfu and landed 5,000 to 10,000 troops. Airplanes aided in the attack. Italian fire was concentrated on the town's Old Fortress, which had long been demilitarized and served as a shelter for refugees from Asia Minor, and on the Cities Police school at the New Fortress, which was also a refugee shelter. The bombardment lasted 15 to 30 minutes. As a result of the bombardment 16 civilians were killed, 30 injured and two had limbs amputated, while according to other sources 20 were killed and 32 wounded. There were no soldiers reported among the victims, all of whom were refugees and orphans. The majority of those killed were children. The Commissioner of the Save the Children Fund described the bombing as \"inhuman and revolting, unjustifiable and unnecessary.\n\nThe prefect of Corfu, Petros Evripaios, and Greek officers and officials were arrested by the Italians and detained aboard an Italian warship. The Greek garrison of 150 men did not surrender but retired to the interior of the island.\n\nAfter the landing, the Italian officers were worried that British citizens may have been wounded or killed, and were relieved when they learned that there were no British among the victims.\n\nThe residence of the British officer in charge of the police training school, who was away on vacation, was looted by Italian soldiers.\n\nMussolini in a speech denounced the Greek government for not understanding that \"Corfu had been Venetian for four hundred years\" before becoming part of Greece in 1864. Throughout the crisis, Mussolini kept stating that Corfu had been ruled by Venice in a manner that suggested he viewed Corfu as rightfully part of Italy rather than Greece under the grounds that Italy was the heir to the Most Serene Republic of Venice. One of the few groups in Italy who did object to the bombardment were the senior diplomats of the Palazzo Chigi who were not informed. Many of them, including Salvatore Contarini, the Permanent Secretary to the Foreign Minister, were on vacation on the day of the bombardment.\n\nDuring the crisis, Contarini together with Antonio Salandra, the Italian delegate to the League of Nations, and Romano Avezzana, the Italian ambassador to France, emerged as a force for moderation within the Italian government, constantly working to persuade Mussolini to drop his more extreme demands and to accept a compromise. Mussolini who only became prime minister on 28 October 1922, was determined to assert his power by proving that he was an unconventional leader who did not follow the normal rules of diplomacy, and the Corfu crisis was the first clash between Mussolini and the traditional elites in Italy, who while not objecting to imperialistic policies, disliked \"Il Duce\"'s reckless style. At the time, Italy was engaging in negotiations with Britain for the cession of Jubaland in East Africa and Jarabub in North Africa to the Italian empire. From the viewpoint of the Palazzo Chigi, the success of these negotiations hinged in part on presenting Italy as a responsible partner to Britain, which was threatened by Mussolini's rash behavior such as the occupation of Corfu.\n\nFollowing the incident, the Greek government proclaimed martial law throughout Greece. The Greek fleet was ordered to retire to the Gulf of Volos to avoid contact with the Italian fleet.\nIn the Athens Cathedral, a solemn memorial service was held for the persons who were killed in the Corfu bombardment, and the bells of all of the churches were tolled continuously. After the service, demonstrations against Italy broke out. \nAll places of amusement were closed as a sign of mourning for the victims of the bombardment.\n\nAfter the protest of the Italian Minister, the Greek Government suspended for one day the newspaper \"Eleftheros Typos\" for characterizing the Italians as \"\"the fugitives of Caporetto\"\" and dismissed the censor for allowing the statement to pass.\nThe Greek Government provided a detachment of 30 men to guard the Italian Legation in Athens. Greek newspapers were unanimous in condemning Italy's action.\n\nItaly closed the Straits of Otranto to Greek ships. In addition, Italy suspended all Greek shipping companies sailing for her, and ordered Italian ships to boycott Greece, although the Greek ports were open to Italian vessels.\nGreek steamers were detained in Italian ports and one was seized by a submarine in the straits of Corfu, but on September 2, the Italian Ministry of Marine ordered all Greek ships to be released from Italian ports.\nAnti-Greek demonstrations broke out in Italy again. The Italian government ordered the Italian reservists in London to hold themselves in readiness for army service. The King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel III, returned to Rome from his summer residence immediately. The Italian military attaché who was sent to inquire into the murder of the Italian delegates was recalled by the Italian legation, and Greek journalists were expelled from Italy.\n\nAlbania reinforced the Greco-Albanian frontier and prohibited passage across.\n\nSerbian newspapers declared that Serbia would support Greece, while elements in Turkey advised Mustafa Kemal to seize the opportunity to invade Western Thrace.\n\nHead of the Near East Relief said that the bombardment was completely unnecessary and unjustified. Italy called the American legation to protest against this statement.\n\nChairman on the League of Nations commissioning assisting deported women and children, who was eyewitness of the bombardment said: \"The crime of Corfu was official murder by a civilized nation...I consider the manner in which Corfu occupied as inhuman.\"\n\nLord Curzon, wrote that the \"terms demanded by Mussolini are extravagant-much worse than the ultimatum after Sarajevo\". In a telegram to the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, who was vacationing at Aix-les-Bains, Lord Curzon wrote that Mussolini's actions were \"violent and inexcusable\" and if Britain did not support the Greek appeal to the League of Nations then \"that institution may as well shut its doors\".Harold Nicolson and Sir William Tyrrell at the Foreign Office wrote a memo calling for \"concentrating our efforts to protect Greece through the agency of the League of Nations against an unfair exploitation by Italy\". Lord Curzon's initial attempt to end the crisis by referring it to the League of Nations was dropped after Mussolini threatened to leave the League. More importantly, sanctions against Italy would require the approval of the League Council and it was believed that France would veto any sanctions against Italy if the Corfu incident was referred to the League. Within Whitehall, the Treasury objected to sanctions against Italy under the grounds that the United States was not a member of the League and any League sanctions if adopted would be ineffective as the United States would continue to trade with Italy while the Admiralty demanded a declaration of war against Italy as the prerequisite of a blockade. Howard William Kennard, in charge of the British embassy in Rome as the ambassador Sir Ronald Graham was on vacation, wrote in a dispatch to Lord Curzon that Mussolini was possibly insane, a man suffering from a \"mixture of megalomania and extreme patriotism\". Kennard drew the conclusion that Mussolini was perhaps rash enough to turn the crisis into an all-out war between Italy and Greece as he kept demanding sums of money in compensation that were well beyond Greece's ability to pay. However, Kennard believed that the Fascist regime was the only thing saving Italy from communism, and if Mussolini were defeated in a war, then the Fascist regime would collapse and the Italian Communist Party would take over. As Kennard much preferred Fascism in power in Italy to Communism, this led him to advocate appeasement, saying that Britain must pressure Greece to submit to the Italian terms while trying to persuade Mussolini to lower the compensation amounts as the best way of avoiding a war. Farther afield, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia were more supportive of Greece with both governments condemning Italy's actions.\n\nOn September 1, Greece appealed to the League of Nations, but Antonio Salandra, the Italian representative to the League, informed the Council that he had no permission to discuss the crisis.\nMussolini refused to co-operate with the League and demanded that the Conference of Ambassadors should deal with the matter. Italy assured that it would leave the League rather than allow the League to interfere.\n\nBritain favored referring the Corfu matter to the League of Nations, but France opposed such a course of action fearing that it would provide a precedent for the League to become involved in the French occupation of the Ruhr.\n\nWith the threat of Mussolini to withdraw from the League and lack of French support the matter went to the Conference of Ambassadors. Italy's prestige was safeguarded and the French were relieved from any linkage between Corfu and the Ruhr at the League of Nations.\n\nOn September 8 the Conference of Ambassadors announced to both Greece and Italy, as well as to the League of Nations, the terms upon which the dispute should be settled.\n\nThe decision was that:\n\nBoth Greece, on September 8, and Italy, on September 10, accepted it. Italy added, however, that she would not evacuate the island until Greece had given full satisfaction.\n\nIn Italy the press widely reported satisfaction with the Conference's decision and praised Mussolini.\n\nOn September 11 the Greek delegate, Nikolaos Politis, informed the Council that Greece had deposited the 50,000,000 lire in a Swiss bank and on September 15, the Ambassadors Conference informed Mussolini that Italy must evacuate Corfu on the September 27, at the latest.\n\nOn September 26, before the inquiry had finished, the Conference of Ambassadors awarded Italy an indemnity of 50,000,000 lire, on the alleged ground that \"the Greek authorities had been guilty of a certain negligence before and after the crime.\"\n\nIn addition, Italy demanded from Greece 1,000,000 lire per day for the cost of the occupation of Corfu and Conference of the Ambassadors replied that Italy reserved the right of recourse to an International Court of Justice in connection with the occupation expenses.\n\nIn Greece there was a general depression over the decision, because Italy obtained practically everything she demanded.\n\nHarold Nicolson, a first secretary in the central department of the Foreign Office said: \"In response to the successive menaces of M. Mussolini we muzzled the League, we imposed the fine on Greece without evidence of her guilt and without reference to the Hague, and we disbanded the Commission of Enquiry. A settlement was thus achieved.\"\n\nOn September 27 the Italian flag was lowered and the Italian troops evacuated Corfu. The Italian fleet and a Greek destroyer saluted the Italian flag, and when the Greek flag hoisted, the Italian flagship saluted it.\n\n40,000 residents of Corfu welcomed the prefect when he landed, and shouldered him to the prefecture. British and French flags were waved by the crowd which demonstrated enthusiastically in front of the Anglo-French consulates.\n\nThe Italian squadron had been ordered to remain anchored till Italy received the 50 million lire.\n\nThe 50,000,000 lire deposited in a Swiss bank were at the disposal of The Hague Tribunal and the bank refused to transfer the money to Rome without the authority of the Greek National Bank, which was given on the evening of the same day.\n\nOn September 30, the Italian fleet, except one destroyer, departed.\n\nThe reputation of Mussolini in Italy was enhanced.\n\nIn Corfu during the first quarter of the 20th century, many Italian operas were performed at the Municipal Theatre of Corfu. This tradition came to a halt following the Corfu incident. After the bombardment, the theatre featured Greek operas as well as Greek theater performances by distinguished Greek actors such as Marika Kotopouli and .\n\nThe ulterior motive for the invasion was Corfu's strategic position at the entrance of the Adriatic Sea.\n\nThe crisis was the first major test for the League of Nations but the League failed it. It showed that the League was weak and couldn't settle disputes when a great power confronted a small one. The authority of the League had been openly defied by Italy, a founding member of the League and a permanent member of the Council. The Italian Fascist regime had managed to prevail in its first major international confrontation.\n\nThe crisis was also a failure for the policy of Great Britain, which had appeared as the greatest champion of the League during the crisis. As the Greeks became focused on securing the return of Corfu, the Dodecanese islands issue faded into the background, and the Greek government ceased to protest the continued Italian occupation of the islands, which Mussolini formally annexed to Italy in 1925.\n\nIn addition, it showed the purpose and tone of Fascist foreign policy. Italy's invasion of Corfu was Mussolini's most aggressive move of the 1920s. The reputation of Mussolini in Italy was enhanced.\n\nAn Italian Post Office opened on September 11, 1923 in Corfu, issuing a set of 8 Italian stamps overprinted \"CORFÙ\" which were placed on sale on the 20th.

{"id": "1941719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941719", "title": "Stepford Cuckoos", "text": "Stepford Cuckoos\n\nThe Stepford Cuckoos are a set of fictional mutant psychically linked quintuplets (Celeste Cuckoo, Esme Cuckoo, Irma \"Mindee\" Cuckoo, Phoebe Cuckoo, and Sophie Cuckoo) appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The alphabetical order of the Cuckoos' first names corresponds with their ages, with Celeste being the firstborn and Sophie being the youngest. Originally calling themselves the Five-in-One, with the deaths of Esme and Sophie the remaining sisters are now known as the Three-in-One.\n\nThey are students at the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning. The Stepford Cuckoos made their live action debut as the Frost sisters Esme, Sophie, and Phoebe in the television series \"The Gifted\" portrayed by Skyler Samuels.\n\nFirst appearing in \"New X-Men\", vol. 1 #118, they were created by Grant Morrison. Their origin, as the artificially created \"daughters\" of Emma Frost, is revealed in \"\".\n\nEsme and Sophie were among the feature characters in the 2011 two-issue limited series \"Chaos War: X-Men\".\n\nAs revealed in the first issue of \"\", the sisters are grown from ova cells harvested from telepath Emma Frost while she lay comatose after a Sentinel attack that killed her students, the original Hellions, and are only five of many cloned daughters. They state that over a thousand eggs were stolen from Emma's ovaries during her coma, and the remaining hundreds (if not thousands) of clones reside within incubation chambers inside a hidden underground laboratory at \"The World\", a complex housing the Weapon Plus (living beings designed to serve as weapons) program. They were created by Dr. John Sublime to be powerful weapons able to kill every mutant by combining their telepathic abilities. The Cuckoos were designated \"Weapon XIV.\"\n\nThey were first introduced as the protégés and favorites of Emma Frost and were unaware of their true purpose and a telepathic block was used to mask their placement in the school, causing anyone who questioned their origins to lose their train of thought. They, along with student Quentin Quire, were noted as the strongest telepaths among the new students at the Xavier Institute of Higher Learning. Although Quire and the Stepford Cuckoos were rivals, Quire had a crush on Sophie. Sophie and the other Cuckoos considered him to be disgusting and rejected him completely.\n\nPartly as an expression of adolescent rebellion, partly under the influence of a mutant drug called Kick, and partly out of a desire to impress Sophie, Quire incited a student riot at the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning. Sophie died stopping Quire, having used the same drug to boost her powers and overexerting herself. The Stepford Cuckoos held Frost to be partially responsible for Sophie's death - with Frost having \"inspired her to heroism\" - and disassociated themselves from her at that time. With the death of Sophie, the Five-in-One became the Four-in-One. Wary of having a part of themselves missing, they tested to see if their powers still functioned well by contacting Jean Grey telepathically and informing her that Emma Frost was attempting to conduct an affair with her husband, Scott Summers.\n\nSecretly, Esme Cuckoo had been collaborating with X-Man Xorn, then disguised as Magneto. Taking control of the Cuckoos' group mind, she telepathically steers Angel Salvadore to attack Emma Frost, completely shattering her diamond body into fragments. Jean Grey manages to telekinetically reassemble Frost and return her to life, whereupon Emma revealed Esme's involvement. Esme then abandons her sisters to join Magneto's new Brotherhood of Mutants. Later losing faith in Xorn, the Brotherhood turns on him, including Esme, who attacks him, angry that he did not return her affections. Xorn then kills her and she dies in Emma's arms, stating with her dying breath that she never wanted to end up like Emma.\n\nSoon afterwards, the Institute is rebuilt, with Emma Frost and Cyclops as headmasters and leaders of the X-Men. Frost and Summers divided the older students into several six-person training squads, each taught by a staff member. The remaining three Cuckoos, now calling themselves the \"\"Three-in-One\",\" were assigned to the Corsairs squad, advised by Cyclops. The three girls were the co-leaders of the squad.\n\nIn \"\" (March–June 2005), the cosmic entity known as the Phoenix Force came back to Earth seeking to inhabit the body of Jean Grey. Quentin Quire, still in love with Sophie, sensed the Phoenix and exhumed Sophie's body. He sought the Phoenix, which resurrected Sophie, but she promptly chooses to die again rather than be with him. The X-Men defeat the Phoenix, though a shard of it in firefly form locates Celeste.\n\nIn \"New X-Men\", vol. 1 #154 (May 2004), the Stepford Cuckoos are identified as Weapon XIV (each girl being units 1 to 5, ordered alphabetically by their first names), the living weapon code between Weapon XIII (Fantomex) and Weapon XV (Ultimaton).\nManipulated by both the shard of the Phoenix and Dr. John Sublime, the Cuckoos reanimate Esme and Sophie as corpses and return to the \"World\". At the World, they are greeted by a computer image of Sublime and learn of their thousands of cloned siblings. Their true purpose was to collect data on the X-Men and transmit it to the other clones through shared nano-technology in their bodies. It is revealed that the Phoenix fragment has manifested in order to destroy the Cuckoos and all of their clones to prevent them from being activated as a weapon and killing all mutants. The Phoenix manifests most strongly through Celeste, using her as its avatar, but is then diffused according to Sublime's plans among each of the cloned telepaths, boosting their powers. The Cuckoos then learn that they also shared Emma's ability to turn into a diamond form. Now referring to themselves as the Thousand-in-One and under Sublime's control, the cosmically-empowered psychics proceed to enact their programmed destiny of mutant destruction. Celeste, at Emma's behest, accepts her role as a Phoenix host and wrestles control of the Phoenix, freeing the clones from Sublime's control for the first time. However, the Phoenix goes on to destroy the thousand clones, despite their newfound freedom and desire to experience life, by shattering their newly manifested diamond forms as well as Esme and Sophie. Disgusted by the destruction, Celeste casts the entity out of her body. However, it refuses to depart causing Celeste to reabsorb it into her own and Mindee and Phoebe's diamond hearts to end the Phoenix's destruction. Unlike Emma's diamond composition, which contains a flaw, the Cuckoo's hearts are flawless diamond. As such, the Phoenix fragment is literally sealed within their hearts. The price the sisters must pay for this is that they can never again feel emotion, leaving them more detached from others than they were before.\n\nThe Stepford Cuckoos are being considered as \"potential recruits\" for the Initiative program. The girls are next seen helping Elixir master medical and anatomical knowledge via Beast's brain. They are soon after teleported to Limbo with the other students and captured by Belasco who has helmets placed on them to keep them asleep to prevent them from using their powers. They were freed by a newly revived X-23 and turn the tide of the battle against Belasco. When the Hulk attacks Xavier, the Astonishing X-Men, and the New X-Men, the Stepford Cuckoos contact several other X-teams such as Excalibur, the Uncanny X-team, and X-Factor to get their help. They then help Prodigy access all his forgotten knowledge and abilities to compensate for his power loss as thanks for saving them when anti-mutant terrorists known as the Purifiers attacked the school.\n\nThe Cuckoos use Cerebro to track down Cable, who has the missing mutant baby for whom the X-Men are looking.\n\nWhen the X-Men arrive at the location indicated by the Cuckoos, the baby had already been stolen by the Marauders. The Cuckoos are unable to relocate the baby telepathically, so Emma Frost orders them to focus on finding the Marauders who kidnapped it.\n\nFollowing the events of the Messiah Complex, the Cuckoos rejoin the X-Men in their new home of San Francisco, along with many of their former classmates. The girls later agree to help erase Josh Foley's memory of his work with the newly reformed X-Force team, so as to help the team maintain a sense of a secrecy from the main X-Men team. They agree to keep the team a secret, primarily out of loyalty to Cyclops. The girls have recently begun to dress more individually than before, no longer wearing matching outfits. Each of them also have different hairstyles, with only one of the Cuckoos keeping their prior hairstyle.\n\nThe Cuckoos help oppose Skrull invaders in San Francisco. When the Skrulls place a blockade on all telepathic communication, they channel their telepathy through Cerebra into Emma as she attempts to find the psychic blockade and destroy it. Emma's psyche is briefly disconnected from her body and as she fights the Skrull psychics, the Cuckoos, on orders from Cyclops, use their telepathy to keep Emma's autonomic functions going. Afterward, the Cuckoos appear as supporting characters in \"Uncanny X-Men\".\n\nDuring a pitched battle between the X-Men and a pack of genetically altered versions of Predator X, the Phoenix fragments that were contained in the Cuckoos' diamond hearts leave them and depart into space for reasons unknown. During their time on Utopia, the Cuckoos begin to experience boredom and start sneaking off the island to buy DVDs of horror films. Influenced by the movies, the girls start mentally torturing their classmates using scenarios from \"The Twilight Zone\" and \"Ring\" among others. After Emma discovers this, she reveals that as a child she was a fan of the film \"Clash of the Titans\", and that she occasionally daydreams of being in the movie herself. Realizing that she always loved teaching, Emma decides to make the Cuckoos into teachers for the island's school, thus giving them something to do with their time.\n\nDuring the \"Chaos War\" storyline, Esme and Sophie are among the fallen X-Men members who return from the dead after what happened to the death realms. Sophie confronted Esme about her death with little resolution. During this time, Sophie befriended Thunderbird. While searching for answers among the remains of the Xavier Institute, the former X-Men were attacked by Carrion Crow: Eater of the Dead. Esme later sacrificed herself to save her sister from Carrion Crow. In the aftermath of the defeat of the Chaos King, Sophie is returned to the afterlife after reality is restored by Hercules. Thunderbird even commented that the next time that he is resurrected, it would be with Sophie.\n\nAfter \"Schism\" Phoebe wanted to go to Westchester while Irma wanted to stay at Utopia, leaving the deciding vote to Celeste, who chose Utopia after learning that Quentin Quire was going to be at Westchester. Following the death of Charles Xavier and the appearance in the present day of the original five X-Men, the Cuckoos decide to join Cyclops's new iteration of the Xavier School.\n\nDuring \"AvX\" the Stepford Cuckoos came to stay at the Jean Grey School. When Cyclops and his team came to confront Beast about bringing the original X-Men forward in time the Cuckoos left with them. When Teen Angel tried to leave Wolverine's school Teen Jean tried to force him to stay against his will. As punishment the Cuckoos forced Teen Jean into submission and only relented after Teen Jean had learned her \"lesson.\" Angel then left to join Cyclops's team much to Teen Jean's grief since they were supposed to stay together.\n\nAfter joining the team and getting settled in, Irma changes her hair style, much to Celeste's horror, though Emma approves and encourages Irma and her sisters to be their own people. Irma spots Triage and both seem to have an attraction to each other, but neither acts on it. They later participate as members of Cyclops's team during the Battle of the Atom.\n\nWhen the time-displaced team of the original X-Men join Cyclops's team, Celeste becomes hostile towards the time-displaced teenage Jean Grey. During an excursion to a mall, Jean reveals to Celeste that Irma and Phoebe do not have a problem with her like Celeste does. The group encounters a member of the Inhumans, and the Cuckoos as well as Jean Grey are knocked out.\n\nThe remaining Cuckoos, feeling empty without their sisters, opted to seek out and employ a genetic regeneration specialist who did work at The Facility behind Laura Kinney's genesis. Through the mental manipulation of one Dr. Helen Marks by Phoebe, Irma and Celeste, the professor was able to fabricate clone bodies from D.N.A templates identical to the trio's fallen siblings, whilst the Cuckoo's beckoned the wayward consciousnesses of Sophie and Esme from the afterlife to inhabit them. The process was flawed however, as the xeroxed bodies rejected the psychic imprint of their mortal hosts; causing their bodies to deteriorate at an accelerated pace.\n\nIn order to properly preserve their dying matriarchs. Esme, caring an ailing Sophie by her side, demanded they go through with an alternative plan. That being securing the healthy body of an X-23 program subject, Gabby.\n\nIn reality however, Esme had been manipulating both her sisters and their engineering assistants from behind closed doors the entire time. Subtly pushing her three living relatives into mind controlling several biophysical manipulation experts to giving herself a new lease on life, as well as having Helen create a cellular degeneration compound with which she used to murder her sister Sophie behind everyone's backs again. All while pleading that the former head of the 5-in-one died over night. A chase would ensue after the three-in-one managed to send out a false text to call Gabby to their location at an abandoned church, wherein they put Laura under psychic hallucination as the three made off with their prize.\n\nX-23 would soon follow in hot pursuit but was bamboozled again into chasing the wrong mini van by the Cuckoos.The three of them would utilize a mental transference device crafted by Dr. Marks to extrapolate and imprint psi-signatures onto healthy bodies with vast recuperative abilities to siphon Esme's mind from her faulty body over to Gabby's healthier vessel.\n\nBut the process would be interrupted by Laura, who was alerted to their location via GPS tracker activated by her foster sister right as the experiment commenced. In the aftermath of which Esme's persona would successfully carry over onto Gabby's being while Laura herself had been blasted out of the barn area where the procedure was underway. As a consequence of trying to intercept the occurrence, X-23 ended up with the consciousness of Sophie Cuckoo set within her mind.\n\nAs Mindee was sent out to find whether or not Laura had perished in the blast. The newly rejuvenated Gabby/Esme began discussing her plan of ascendance to her two remaining sisters Phoebe and Celeste. Meanwhile the former leader of the quintumvirate, Sophie, would communicate with Laura in the mental plane, explaining to her and Cuckoo family's life story just as Irma would run into Laura thinking it was Sophie in the physical world. After some harsh coercion by the former and more nuanced explanations by her deceased sibling, Mindee is appalled at the discovery Esme had schemed, lied and killed her only kin once more after returning from beyond the grave. Reluctantly offering her assistance to the Laura/Sophie amalgam in their efforts to stop the current three-in-one from reaching Cerebro before Esme can gain control of it. As Esme and the other Cuckoo's make their way to the Xavier Institute, they are intercepted by a bazooka packing Beast riding a helicopter while their leader rants about how the X-Men wasted their time and their lives protecting worthless humans. Esme is dismayed to discover the adversary before them was merely an illusion conjured up by Sophie waiting at the school of gifted youngsters. Whom went onto reveal the depth and extent of Esme's betrayal to her other siblings, when the both of them questioned why she would do such a thing after all they went through just to bring them back. Esme coldly rebukes such claims while admitting she compelled their actions thus far from start to finish. Retorting that the Cuckoos were little more than mindless drones without her to think their thoughts for them before stabbing Phoebe with Gabby's bone claw. While Laura got into a brutal fight with Esme with Sophie keeping their shared mind free of her psychotic sister's mental influence, Irma managed to make her way to Cerebro to galvanize the other Cuckoo's psychic powers through her and Laura. All towards the purpose of excising their deranged number from Gabby's body, where afterwards the equally disembodied Sophie would bury her twisted psyche so deep she would never resurface again. In the aftermath, the remaining Cuckoo clones would disappear for a time. Laura would hear tell they're squatting in Paris, something she knows that they know that Sophie would've enjoyed.\n\nProfessor Xavier, now simply called X, apparently used Krakoa's unique abilities to bring both Sophie and Esme back to life at some point. The once bitter enemies acted as tour guides to a group of government officials while showing off the new Jerusalem Habitat created by Krakoa.\n\nThe Cuckoos share a telepathic hive mind. Powerful telepaths individually, their combined power is even greater than its sum. These powers allow them the psychic standards of broadcasting/receiving thoughts, mind control, planting illusions, force blasts of pure psionic energy, astral projection, etc. Their gestalt mind allows them to communicate with one another instantaneously, though the strength of their gestalt depends on their proximity to one another; the further they are from one another, the weaker their ability to connect.\n\nThough they most often function and act as one unit, they are indeed capable of thinking and operating individually. When all five sisters were alive, Sophie was the dominant consciousness and often commanded the Cuckoos. However, as implied by Esme's actions, it is possible for another one of the Cuckoos to wrest control of the gestalt and perhaps even use the powers of all sisters without the consent and knowledge of the others. With the loss of Sophie and Esme, The Cuckoos are not as strong as they were with five.\n\nLike their mother, Emma Frost, each Cuckoo sister also possesses the ability to transform into an organic diamond body, and as such gains invulnerability, durability, and super strength. Unlike Frost, however, their diamond forms are flawless; such that nothing can enter or escape. They demonstrate this ability by sealing the splintered fragment of the Phoenix Force inside their hearts by permanently changing their hearts to diamond, in the process sacrificing their ability to ever feel genuine emotions again. The Phoenix Force eventually manages to escape, potentially allowing the sisters to regain their emotions. During the \"Warsong\" series, the Cuckoos gained the power of flight and pyrokinesis, presumably from Phoenix-induced telekinesis.\n\nAdditionally, the Cuckoos have demonstrated telekinesis.\n\nThe power level of the Cuckoos, in all of their incarnations, have been reported by many of the staff at Xavier's School to be extremely impressive and strong.\n\nSophie Cuckoo's personality is explored just before her death. She was stated as always being the dominant mind amongst her sisters. When Quentin Quire started a riot on the Xavier Campus, Sophie was \"inspired to heroism\" and used Kick to strengthen her powers and fight him. The strain killed Sophie, though it was secretly Esme's psychic influence that ultimately pushed her toward death. She has since been portrayed in other realities as the most free-thinking of the Cuckoos.\n\nDown the line of publishing, Sophie shows a more maternal and chivalrous expression of character towards her siblings. Even towards Esme whom had betrayed and killed her twice. Showing she felt extreme amounts of guilt over her siblings actions which nearly cost Laura her own sister due to the deranged Cuckoo's machinations. Sophie is also revealed to be incredibly insightful to the underlying character ticks of her sisters, having guessed Esme hated being a clone; but failed to see her growing to hate her other siblings for which over time as well. Accurately surmising that Esme's psychotic tendencies come from extreme self hatred, in part of feeling like she's less of a person due to being a counterfeit person.\n\nPhoebe Cuckoo demonstrated a power-hungry personality during the events of \"Warsong\". In contrast to Celeste, who feared the consuming power of the Phoenix, Phoebe desired power out of the sheer affinity for wielding it. She readily embraced the Phoenix and enjoyed the destructive power it gave her.\n\nMindee Cuckoo was the next Cuckoo to be written with a distinct personality. She had a relationship with another student, Germaine, who was killed by an anti-mutant mob when the students were trapped in a building in the aftermath of Xorn's destruction of Manhattan. She then had a combative relationship with Jay Guthrie who was always interrupting her while she played the piano. She later helped Gambit during Exodus's Brotherhood's attack on the school. Her real first name is \"Irma\".\n\nIrma has now dyed her hair and cut it short; she is now a brunette. Triage is attracted to her and the feeling might be mutual.\n\nDuring the events of \"Warsong\", Celeste Cuckoo expressed fears of losing touch with her sisters, changing personalities, and wielding the Phoenix Force. According to Emma, she is the tattletale of the group. She eventually accepted her powers, killing the Thousand-in-One clones and her resurrected sisters per the cosmic judgment of Phoenix. Disgusted by the destruction the Phoenix caused, she tried to expel the Phoenix fragment from her body, but was instead forced to seal it inside Mindee's, Phoebe's, and her own diamond hearts. She is portrayed as the most compassionate of all the Cuckoos.\n\nUpon meeting a teenage Jean Grey who was brought to the present by Beast, Celeste takes an instant dislike towards her and they are constantly bickering. When Irma decides to change her hair style and act more like an individual, Celeste is horrified at the thought of losing her connection to her sister. Much to her despair, Emma welcomes the sisters' growing individuality. Celeste also finds that her sisters both have little problem with Jean, furthering their divide.\n\nEsme Cuckoo was the first to split from her sisters, falling in love with Shi'ar-soldier Stuff who disguised itself as a student. She soon attempts to murder Frost, and was later revealed to be the one responsible for the events that killed Sophie. Wanting to seize control of the Cuckoos but encountering resistance from Sophie, Esme used the drug Kick on herself to augment her own psychic powers and take control of the Stepford Cuckoos' group mind. Esme manipulated her sister Sophie into also using the drug Kick in order to overexert her telepathic powers to the point of death. Esme returned in the \"\" storyline, in which it was revealed that Esme had been working for Xorn the entire time, and that she had developed a crush on him. However, Esme turned on him and tried to destroy his mind after he rejected her affections. Xorn, hopped up on the Sublime contrived drug Hypercortisone D at the time, angrily killed her by smashing her metal earrings through her skull. She dies in Emma's arms, who tells Esme that out of all the Cuckoos, she was most proud of her. In later publishing Esme shows just how cruel, deceitful, power hungry and megalomaniac she can be; the fourth volume of X-23 would reveal the true magnitude of her truly murderous nature; manipulating her living siblings from beyond the grave, murdering and injuring them in order to achieve a desirable outcome for herself and reveling in the newfound invincibility that came with a Wolverine-lite body.\n\nOriginally, the first letter of each of the Cuckoo's names was supposed to spell out the word \"spice\" when put in proper sequence, Sophie, Phoebe, Irma, Celeste and Esme, a reference to the British pop group, the Spice Girls. However, Grant Morrison never mentioned the name of the fifth Cuckoo (the one whose name was supposed to start with \"I\") during his run on New X-Men, and it was only later on that this fifth Cuckoo was named \"Mindee\" by Chuck Austen, who was unaware of Morrison's Easter egg. However, writer Matt Fraction later rectified this, stating that Mindee's real first name was Irma, thus restoring the original acronym.\n\nThey were first called the Stepford Cuckoos in \"New X-Men\", vol. 1 #123 (April 2002), which was also the first issue in which Esme was named. Sophie, Phoebe, Celeste, and Mindee were named in \"New X-Men\", vol. 1 #134 (January 2003), \"New X-Men\", vol. 1 #149 (January 2004), \"New X-Men\", vol. 1 #153 (April 2004), and \"New X-Men\", vol. 1 #156 (June 2004), respectively. In the \"New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook\", their last name was confirmed as \"Cuckoo\" and their codename as the \"Three-in-One\".\n\nIn the \"Age of X\" reality, the Stepford Cuckoos are shown as inmates of Fortress X's X-Brig.\n\nIn a reality shown in \"Exiles\", where after the Hulk was jettisoned into space and discovered by Annihilus, killing him and taking the Annihilation Wave to Earth, Sophie, Esme and Mindee appear as some of the few remaining superhumans. Sophie has detached herself from the two remaining Cuckoos and is dating Quentin Quire, while Esme and Mindee remain like their original depictions in the main Marvel Universe. Sophie's mental abilities have also increased, and she has recurring dreams of future events to come.\n\nIn the \"Here Comes Tomorrow\" timeline, 150 years from now, Celeste, Mindee and Phoebe are members of the X-Men and operators of Cerebra, having merged with the machine, and calling themselves the \"\"Three-in-One\".\" Their psychic powers have also been amplified, allowing them to see the future. Despite the long time that has passed, they appear to be in their early twenties. With the release of the \"Warsong\" miniseries this can be attributed to the nanites in their bodies and their origins as Weapon XIV.\n\nIn \"House of M\", the quintuplets were part of the New Mutant Leadership Program at the United Nations. From the five, Sophie appeared to be the one with the stronger personality. Sophie joined Prodigy, Surge and the rest of the New Mutants on their trip to Japan to find Seiji Ashida, while Celeste, Esme, Mindee, and Phoebe remained in New York, though they agreed to maintain the secret. Sophie was later killed in Japan by anti-mutant terrorists.\n\nIn the alternate future depicted in \"\", Celeste, Mindee, and Phoebe have each developed their own look and now call themselves \"\"the Spikes\".\" Phoebe has long, brown hair, Mindee has long, blond hair, and Celeste has short, black hair.\n\n\n\nThree identical blonde girls appear in the background during a scene which takes place at Xavier's Institute in \"\" (2006). One of the film's co-writers, Zak Penn confirmed in an online chat that these were indeed the Stepford Cuckoos / Three-in-One.\n\nThe Stepford Cuckoos appear as antagonists in the video game \"\", voiced by Jennifer Hale. They are encountered in the Madri Temple and end up handing Emma Frost over to Apocalypse. They fight the X-Men alongside Holocaust who serves as their protector. There was a reference that they left the X-Mansion when their fourth sister was killed in action in a recent mission.\n\n"}
{"id": "1941722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941722", "title": "I due Foscari", "text": "I due Foscari\n\nAfter his success with \"Ernani\", Verdi received a commission from Rome's Teatro Argentina and he went to work with Piave in considering two subjects, one of which eventually became this opera. \"I due Foscari\" was given its premiere performance in Rome on 3 November 1844 and was generally quite successful, although not on the scale of \"Ernani\", which remained Verdi's most popular opera until \"Il trovatore\" in 1853.\n\nAfter \"Ernani\", Verdi had considered a large number of projects for the future and the Byron play was one of them. \"Foscari\" had even been considered as early as 1843 when he had been approached by La Fenice in Venice, but it was rejected as unsuitable because the story included criticism of actions of the Republic of Venice which may have been offensive to the great families who had governed the Republic, including the extant Foscari family.\n\nAt the same time, the composer had accepted a commission from the Teatro Argentina in Rome and had considered the subject of Lorenzino de' Medici on which Piave had already begun work. Verdi encouraged the librettist to continue his work and then submit the work to the Roman authorities but, as a backup, he wrote: \"But, just in case the police don't allow it, we'll have to think of a quick alternative and I suggest \"The Two Foscari\". I like the plot and the outline is already there in Venice.\" It appears that Verdi had already submitted it to La Fenice at some earlier time, and so he encouraged Piave to work on it, \"but stick closely to Byron\" he noted.\n\nAs it turned out, the de Medici libretto was rejected by the Teatro Argentina and \"I due Foscari\" was substituted. This gave Verdi the opportunity to re-read Byron's play and, in doing so, he came to the realization (which he expressed in a letter to Piave) that the librettist had better NOT 'stick close to Byron': \"...the play does not quite have the theatrical grandeur needed for an opera; so rack your brains and try to find something which will make a bit of a splash particularly in the first act\" and he continues by stressing that \"it's a fine subject, delicate and full of pathos\".\" Thus, the rather lower key of the original piece stood out in direct contrast to the opera by which it was succeeded. However, as musicologist Roger Parker notes, it appears that Verdi was \"concentrating on personal confrontations rather than grand scenic effects\".\n\nUpon receiving the libretto by mid-May, the composer sent a long series of letters to the librettist over several months instructing him on many points where changes were needed. They revealed \"the extent to which Verdi intervened in the making of the libretto, a good deal of the large-scale structure of the opera being dictated by his increasingly exigent theatrical instincts.\" With the music completed over the summer, \"I due Foscari\" was given its Rome premiere performance on 3 November 1844.\n\n19th century\nReaction to the premiere was tempered by several elements outside of Verdi's control, including the recent rise in seat prices by the management and the rather lackluster quality of the performers' voices. But the reception given to the composer by the management was very enthusiastic as was that of some of the press, especially the critic of \"Rivista di Roma\" who noted that \"even more than in \"Ernani\", Verdi has endeavoured to shake off his former manner, to return to the springs of passion and affection\".\n\nUntil the 1860s, the opera was seen in Italy in at least 22 towns and cities, including Livorno, Trieste, Naples, Parma, Bergamo, Teatro Carignano in Torino, Bologna, Catania, Florence, Cremona, Milan, and Modena through the 1846 season. It appeared in Barcelona in 1845 (July), in Lisbon, and Paris in 1846, in Venezia, and Prato in 1847, and in Palermo and Teatro Regio (Turin) between 1850 and 1851.\nThe first performances in the UK were given in London at Her Majesty's Theatre on 10 April 1847. In the US, the opera was first presented in Boston on 10 May 1847. Paris saw a production in December 1846 at the Théâtre des Italiens, and it was taken up by several major Italian opera houses.\n\n20th century and beyond\n\nIn modern times \"Foscari\" has received numerous productions. There was a flurry after the Second World War (Vienna, Barcelona, London, Leningrad, New York),and following a La Fenice staging in 1957 with Leyla Gencer under Tullio Serafin, Piero Cappuccilli led many performances around Italy at the end of that decade and the during the next, with the 1968 Rome production being taken up at the Metropolitan and in Chicago. In 1977 was performed in Barcelona Liceu with Vicente Sardinero and Pedro Lavirgen.\n\nLa Scala presented it in 1988, also with Renato Bruson, a version which is available on DVD. It was performed by the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples in 2000 and recorded on DVD. The Royal Opera presented the opera in June 1995 with Vladimir Chernov and June Anderson in the major roles. Florida's Sarasota Opera included it in March 2008 as part of its \"Verdi Cycle\". It was presented during the 2008/09 seasons of La Scala and the Bilbao Association of Lovers of Opera (ABAO) in Bilbao, Spain.\n\nAlso, concert opera performances have been common. The Opera Orchestra of New York has presented concert versions three times: the first in October 1981 with Renato Bruson in the title role; the second in April 1992 with Vladimir Chernov as the Doge; and the third in December 2007, with Paolo Gavanelli as the Doge.\n\nThe Los Angeles Opera presented a new production in September 2012, with the company's general director and tenor Plácido Domingo singing the baritone role of Francesco Foscari for the first time. Performances were conducted by the company's music director, James Conlon. The production was directed by Thaddeus Strassberger in his debut for the Los Angeles company.\n\nToday \"Foscari\" is regularly performed both in staged productions and concert versions.\n\n\"Scene 1: Outside the Council Chamber of the Doge's Palace\"\n\nMembers of the Council of Ten are waiting to enter the Council Chamber to try the case of Jacopo Foscari, the son of the Doge, who has been accused of murder. Upon the arrival of Loredano (Jacopo's sworn enemy) and his friend Barbarigo, they announce that the Doge has already entered the Chamber. They all enter the Chamber.\n\nHaving recently returned from exile, Jacopo is brought from the prison and expresses his love at seeing Venice again: \"Dal più remoto esilio\" / \"From the most distant place of exile\". When summoned to enter the Chamber and told that he can expect the Council to be merciful, Jacopo explodes in rage: \"Odio solo ed odio atroce\" / \"Only hatred, cruel hatred, is locked within their breasts\". He enters the Chamber.\n\n\"Scene 2: A hall in the palace\"\n\nLucrezia Contarini, Jacopo's wife, learns from her ladies in waiting that the trial is proceeding in the Council Chamber. She quickly demands to see the Doge, Jacopo's father, but is told that she should pray for Jacopo's freedom. Angrily, she implores heaven to be merciful: \"Tu al cui sguardo onnipossente\" / \"Thou beneath whose almighty glance all men rejoice or weep\". Her friend Pisana enters in tears; she relays the news that Jacopo has been sentenced to further exile and this provokes another furious outburst from Lucrezia: \"La clemenza! s'aggiunge lo scherno!\" / \"Their mercy? Now they add insult!\". Pisana and the ladies beg her to trust in the mercy of God.\n\n\"Scene 3: Outside the Council Chamber\"\n\nThe Council of Ten leaves the Chamber proclaiming that the evidence was clearly sufficient to convict Jacopo and that their actions will be seen as just and fair.\n\n\"Scene 4: The Doge's private room\"\n\nThe Doge, Francesco Foscari, enters and wearily sits down. He expresses anguish at what has happened to his son but, as his father, feels there is nothing he can do to save him: \"O vecchio cor che batte\" / \"Oh ancient heart that beats in my breast...\". In tears, Lucrezia comes in and, when she tries to decry the actions of the Council, Francesco reminds her of his position as upholder of the law of Venice. Angrily, she denounces the law as being filled only with hatred and vengeance and demands that he return her husband to her: \"Tu pur lo sai che giudice\" / \"You know it all too well\". The scene ends with the Doge lamenting the limits of his power and the conflicts between being both ruler and father, while Lucrezia continues to demand his help. The sight of his tears gives her some hope.\n\n\"Scene 1: The state prison\"\n\nJacopo is alone in prison and laments his fate. He imagines that he is being attacked by Carmagnola, a famous \"condottiere\" (soldier) who was executed in Venice (\"Non maledirmi o prode\" / \"Mighty warrior, do not curse me\", and he faints. Still delirious, he finds Lucrezia is with him; she tells him of the Council's decision and the punishment of further exile. However, she tries to keep some hope alive and promises to join him in exile if need be.\n\nThe Doge arrives and declares that in spite of the fact that he was forced to act severely, he loves his son. Jacopo is comforted – \"Nel tuo paterno amplesso\" / \"In a father's embrace my sorrow is stilled\" – but is further disturbed by the Doge's claim that his duty must override his love of his son.\n\nLoredano arrives to announce the official verdict and to prepare Jacopo for his departure. He is contemptuous of the pleas of the Foscari and orders his men to remove Jacopo from his cell. In a final trio, Jacopo, the Doge, and Lucrezia express their conflicting emotions and, as Jacopo is taken away, father and daughter-in-law leave together.\n\n\"Scene 2: The Council Chamber\"\n\nLoredano is adamant: there shall be no mercy and Lucrezia and her children will not be allowed to accompany Jacopo on his banishment. The Doge laments his inability to help, acting, as he must, in the role of Doge before that of father. Lucrezia enters with her two children. Jacopo embraces them while Lucrezia pleads with the councilors to no avail. Jacopo is taken away.\n\n\"Scene 1: The Piazetta of San Marco\"\n\nWhile the people who have gathered express their joy at being together, Loredano and Barbarigo wait for the galley that will take Jacopo away to exile. He is led out, followed by his wife and Pisana, and expresses his feelings for Lucrezia: \"All'infelice veglio\" / \"Unhappy woman, unhappy through me alone\". Together, in a huge choral number, Jacopo, Lucrezia, Pisano, Barbarigo, Loredano, and the people of Venice each express their feelings. Jacopo begins: \"O padre, figli, sposa\" / \"Father, children, wife, I bid you a last farewell\", and the scene ends with Jacopo escorted onto the galley while Lucrezia faints in Pisana's arms.\n\n\"Scene 2: The Doge's Palace\"\n\nThe grief-stricken Doge expresses his feelings – \"Egli ora parte!\" (\"Now he is going!\") – and pictures himself alone in his old age. Barbarigo brings him proof that his son was in fact innocent, while Lucrezia comes in to announce Jacopo's death: \"Più non vive... l'innocente\" / \"He is no more... the innocent\". As she leaves, a servant announces that the Council of Ten wish to meet with the Doge.\n\nThe Council, through its spokesman Loredano, announces that it has decided that Francesco, due to age, should give up his position as Doge. Angrily, he denounces their decision: \"Questa dunque è l'iniqua mercede\" / \"This then is the unjust reward...\". He asks for his daughter-in-law to be brought in and gradually lays down the trappings of his office. When Lucrezia enters and addresses him with the familiar title \"Prince\", he declares \"Prince! That I was; now I am no longer.\" Just then, the bell of San Marco is heard announcing that a successor has been chosen. As it tolls a second time, Francesco recognizes that the end has come: \"Quel bronzo feral\" / \"What fatal knell\". As the bell tolls again, he dies; Loredano notes that \"I am paid.\"\n\nWhat does he mean? He goes on to explain that \"not one of the cabalettas begins with the usual instrumental anticipation...[...].. the numbers are welded together with greater coherence even than \"Ernani\"...[...and...].. the scoring is more sensitive than in any of the operas previously written and a good many written after...\" In all, \"Foscari\" is more of a step forward than might be initially imagined.\n\nDavid Kimbell writing in \"The New Penguin Opera Guide\", clarifies some of these elements in the following ways:\n\nHe concludes with the idea that \"this opera remains one of the composer's most intimate and introspective scores\", but it is left to Roger Parker to sum it all up:\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

WCSX's transmitter is in suburban Oakland County in Royal Oak Township near the intersection of 8 Mile Road and Wyoming Avenue. WCSX transmits its signal from an antenna 951 feet high with an effective radiated power of 13,500 watts. Five other Detroit radio stations transmit their signal from the same tower as WCSX. The studios are in Ferndale. Despite its call sign, it is not affiliated with the CSX Corporation.\n\n94.7 FM was originally home to WHFI (\"Whiffieland\"), featuring a MOR/adult contemporary format with disc jockeys such as Lee Alan (formerly of WXYZ). The original FCC Construction Permit for WHFI was issued to Garvin H. Meadowcroft, President of Meadowcroft Broadcasting, Inc. on January 18, 1957 with an address of 1095 Badder Road in Troy, Michigan. Meadowcroft began broadcasting on WHFI September 1, 1958 with a power of 20 kW and an office address of 139 Maple in Birmingham. In 1972, WHFI shifted to a syndicated, automated oldies format provided by Draper-Blore called \"Olde Golde,\" featuring hits of the 1950s and 1960s (similar to Drake-Chenault's \"Solid Gold\" format except without the AC/MOR currents that the Solid Gold format played). In July 1973, Greater Media bought the station; that same year, the \"Olde Golde\" format evolved the following year into all-oldies WHNE, \"Honey Radio.\" Sister station WQTE changed its calls to WHND and began shadowcasting the format in 1974; it would continue as \"Honey Radio\" until 1994, by which time 94.7 FM had gone through several changes. Honey Radio was originally automated using Drake-Chenault's \"Classic Gold\" format, but transitioned to live personalities (on AM 560 only) around 1980, by which time 94.7 FM had changed format.\n\nIn 1976, WHNE became WMJC, \"Magic 95,\" with an adult contemporary format modeled after Greater Media's successful WMGK in Philadelphia.\n\nBy 1987, the adult-contemporary format in Detroit had become quite crowded; in addition to WMJC, Detroit had four other AC stations, WNIC, WOMC, WLTI, and WNTM, with WNIC and the oldies-based WOMC dominating in the format. (The WMJC call letters would be picked for a Top-40/CHR station in Battle Creek, and now are used by a religious station in Kalamazoo. Greater Media would bring the \"Magic\" format and branding back to the Detroit market with WMGC-FM 105.1 from 2001 to 2011.)\n\nOn March 13, 1987, WCSX was launched, with Bob Seger's \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" as its first song. It was one of the first Classic Rock stations in the United States, and is also one of very few nationwide to have endured with the classic rock format for over 25 years.\n\nWCSX's most played bands are classic rock staples The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, Pink Floyd and hometown classic rockers such as Bob Seger and Ted Nugent. WCSX generally takes a softer, older-sounding approach to classic rock reminiscent of progressive and album-oriented rock radio of the 1970s, since sister station WRIF includes a good deal of harder classic rock titles in its playlist, including 1980s glam metal, which WCSX generally does not play. WCSX competition included classic rocker WDTW-FM, who returned to the format in November 2011 before dropping it again in May 2017. WDTW-FM has since returned to the format in January 2019 although rebranded as WLLZ.\n\nWCSX did briefly expand its playlist to harder classic rock in 1996-97 (bands like Rush, Van Halen, Def Leppard, etc.) when Greater Media bought then-recently defunct station WLLZ's library, but went back to its toned down approach when WWBR went to a harder classic-rock format. They also had a short run of playing new songs from their mainstay artists, using the slogan; \"It doesn't have to be old to be a classic\".\n\nOn July 19, 2016, Beasley Media Group announced it would acquire Greater Media and its 21 stations (including WCSX) for $240 million. The FCC approved the sale on October 6, and the sale closed on November 1. As of May 2017, WCSX became Detroit's only classic rock station after former competitor WDTW-FM dropped the format for Adult Hits.\n\nWCSX broadcasts in the HD hybrid format.\nIn August 2005, WCSX launched its digital HD2 sidechannel with a \"Deep Trax\" format. In January 2014, the \"Deep Trax\" format was replaced \"Detroit's Oldies 94.7 HD2\", playing an oldies format. Both WCSX and \"Detroit's Oldies 94.7 HD2\" stream webcasts for internet listeners.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1941733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941733", "title": "Art Brut", "text": "Art Brut\n\nArt Brut are a Berlin-based English and German indie rock band. Their debut album, \"Bang Bang Rock & Roll\", was released on 30 May 2005, with its follow up, \"It's a Bit Complicated\", released on 25 June 2007. Named after French painter Jean Dubuffet's definition of outsider art - art by prisoners, loners, the mentally ill, and other marginalized people, and made without thought to imitation or presentation - South London's Art Brut were tagged by \"NME\" as part of the \"Art Wave\" scene that also included bands such as The Rakes, Franz Ferdinand and Bloc Party. The band released further albums, \"Art Brut vs Satan\" in 2009 and \"Brilliant! Tragic!\" in 2011. A fifth album, \"Wham! Bang! Pow! Let's Rock Out!\"\", was released in 2018.\n\nThe band's sound is characterised by their straightforward guitar rock setup, as well as frontman Eddie Argos' enthusiastic \"sprechgesang\"-style vocal delivery, and his humorous, often self-reflexive lyrics about music, relationships and other personal interests.\n\nThe band was formed in London in 2003, after Eddie Argos met guitarist Chris Chinchilla at an afterparty hosted by London indie rock band Ciccone in 2002. Argos also invited Ian Catskilkin, whom he knew from the Bournemouth music scene, to join on guitars. They were joined by Freddy Feedback on bass guitar and Mikey Breyer on drums. The band played their first gig in May 2003.\n\nThe band self-released two \"Brutlegs\" promos in 2003. The first was produced by Keith Top of the Pops and contained the first versions of \"Formed a Band\", \"Modern Art\" and \"Moving to LA\". A second, released as \"Brutlegs 04\", contained versions of \"Good Weekend\", \"Bang Band Rock & Roll\" and an acoustic version of \"Moving to LA\".\n\nAngular Recording Corporation had released a compilation (\"The New Cross: An Angular Sampler\") featuring \"Formed a Band\" in November 2003. \"NME\" journalist Anthony Thornton heard the song and sent an MP3 to Rough Trade, and the label offered Art Brut a deal to release it as a one-off single. It peaked at number 52 on the UK Singles Chart, in May 2004. \"Blender\" described them as the best unsigned band in the UK.\n\nThe band were soon signed by Fierce Panda. A double A-side of \"Modern Art\" and \"My Little Brother\" was released in December 2004, charting at 49, followed by an album, \"Bang Bang Rock & Roll\", in May 2005. The next single, \"Emily Kane\", made number 41, missing the top 40 only by two sales, later attributed by Argos by a failure to properly register iTunes sales. It remains Fierce Panda's highest-charting single.\n\n\"Bang Bang Rock & Roll\" was produced by John Fortis, who has also worked with artists such as Razorlight, Maxim Reality, The Pipettes, Neneh Cherry and Assembly Now; and features rerecorded versions of their early material.\n\nArt Brut played extensively in support of their album in 2005. Chinchilla left due to the pressures of touring in September 2005, and was replaced at short notice by Jasper Future, guitarist from Argos' old Bournemouth band, The Art Goblins, for Bestival. This new line-up toured Europe, including two support slots with Oasis in October 2005 - the band made the cover of the German edition of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine in September 2005.\n\nIn 2006 Art Brut signed to Mute Records (then owned by EMI) in Europe for the release of another album, with Downtown Records covering the United States. This second album \"It's a Bit Complicated\" was produced by Dan Swift (after an attempt by Russell Senior was rejected by the label). The first single from the album, \"Nag Nag Nag Nag\", was released on 20 November 2006, featuring the b-side \"I Found This Song in the Road\" and five live tracks from the Eurockéennes de Belfort Festival 2006. The song made Single of the Week in \"The Guardian\" 's \"The Guide\" section. In 2007 they played on the American \"NME\" Rock and Roll Riot tour with The Hold Steady. The second single \"Direct Hit\" was released a week before the album, featuring the B-sides \"Don't Blame it on the Trains\" and \"I Want to be Double A-Sided\". The album was released in June 2007. In the United States, the album reached No. 14 on the \"Billboard\" Heatseekers chart and No. 32 on the Independent Albums chart.\n\nEMI had been under financial problems 2007 and was acquired by Terra Firma Venture Capital Partners in August 2007. The label released \"Pump Up the Volume\" as a third single for \"It's A Bit Complicated\" in February 2008, as a digital-only release with no video, apparently without telling the band. This led to the termination of the relationship between the band and the label.\n\nIn late 2008, Art Brut returned to the studio to record their third LP \"Art Brut vs. Satan\" which was released on 20 April 2009, on Cooking Vinyl. The album was produced by Frank Black, in his favourite studio in Salem, Oregon. \"Art Brut vs. Satan\" was released to mainly good reviews scoring 75 on Metacritic. There were two singles released from the album \"Alcoholics Unanimous\" and \"DC Comics & Chocolate Milkshake\". The band toured throughout the year and played the Glastonbury Festival amongst others.\n\nIn late 2010, Art Brut recorded their fourth album, \"Brilliant! Tragic!\", released on 23 May 2011. The first single from the album was \"Lost Weekend\". The album was again produced in Salem by Frank Black.\n\nTo celebrate the 10th anniversary of the band's first gig, in 2013, Art Brut released \"Art Brut Top of the Pops\", a two CD best of compilation album, including B-sides and rarities, such as the \"Brutlegs\" versions of some early songs. The album title refers to the band's chant during live performances of \"Art Brut! Top of the Pops! Art Brut! Top of the Pops!\"\n\nOn 13 September 2013 it was revealed that Breyer and Future had decided to leave the band, and that their replacements would be Stephen Gilchrist and Toby MacFarlaine respectively.\n\nArt Brut's fifth album, \"Wham! Bang! Pow! Let's Rock Out!\", produced by Jim Moray, was released in November 2018, on Alcopop! Records. It was preceded by two singles: the title track \"Wham! Bang! Pow! Let's Rock Out!\", in August 2018, and \"Hospital!\" in October 2018. The band now features Charlie Layton from the Wedding Present on drums. After two dates in London in November and January, the band started their first tour since 2013 in February 2019: UK dates in February and March are to be followed by European shows in April.\n\nArt Brut invited various bands to provide guest vocals on \"Top of the Pops!\", their contribution to the second Angular compilation, \"Rip Off Your Labels: More Angular Product\", including The Boyfriends, The Long Blondes, The Rocks, The Violets, Luxembourg, Ciccone, The Swear and Abdoujaparov. These bands had mostly provided tracks to the Angular compilations themselves. Relations with Bloc Party, also an Angular band, were more strained: a dispute conducted by media between Argos with Bloc Party lead singer Kele culminated in a physical confrontation at a nightclub.\n\nArt Brut had a system of \"franchises\", whose names range from AB0 (the original Art Brut) to AB3.14/Pi, AB², AB17 or even to AB29600 (from Rennes and Morlaix, France), who perform and cover Art Brut songs.\n\nThe band have released a split 7\" with We Are Scientists in 2006, with Art Brut covering We Are Scientists' \"The Great Escape\", and We Are Scientists covering \"Bang Bang Rock & Roll\" (in the style of The Velvet Underground - in reference to the song's lyric of \"I can't stand the sound of the Velvet Underground\"). We Are Scientists also have an Art Brut franchise number, 47. Art Brut resumed their collaboration with We Are Scientists in 2019, with a split 12\" for Record Store Day, as \"WASABI\" (We Are Scientists Art Brut International).\n\nArgos and Black Box Recorder released a single, \"Christmas Number One\", under the name The Black Arts, in 2007.\n\nIn 2010, Argos released an album with the side project Everybody Was in the French Resistance...Now!, featuring Dyan Valdés from The Blood Arm on vocals and keyboards. The album, called \"Fixin' the Charts\" was a collection of songs in responses to classic pop songs, including those by Michael Jackson, Martha Reeves & the Vandellas and Kanye West.\n\nThe band's early supporter Keith Top of the Pops played his first gig in support of Art Brut in New York in 2006, with members of Art Brut acting as his band. Keith has now released three albums, under the name \"Keith Top of the Pops & His Minor UK Indie Celebrity All-Star Backing Band\", which variously feature contributions from most of Art Brut, Black Box Recorder, The Blood Arm, We Are Scientists and numerous other musicians, including members of The Boyfriends, Luxembourg, Ciccone and Abdoujaparov.\n\nCurrent members\n\nFormer members\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1941735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941735", "title": "Law Enforcement Exploring", "text": "Law Enforcement Exploring\n\nLaw Enforcement Exploring, commonly referred to as \"Police Explorers\" is a career-oriented program that gives young adults the opportunity to explore a career in law enforcement by working with local law enforcement agencies. Founded on July 12, 1973, it's one of the Exploring programs from Learning for Life, a non-Scouting subsidiary of the Boy Scouts of America. The program is generally available to qualified young adults who graduated 8th grade and are ages 14 through 21.\n\nLearning for Life (LFL) coordinates the Law Enforcement Exploring program at the national level. LFL provides resources such as advisor training, sample policies, and insurance. LFL also hosts a biannual conference and competition, the National Law Enforcement Explorer Conference.\n\nLocal Explorer programs are chartered by a local law enforcement agency. At least one officer from that agency serves as the post \"Advisor\". This advisor is responsible for department-level administration of the program, and ensuring that the program meets the departments objectives.\n\nMost posts maintain a command structure mirroring that of the hosting agency.\n\nEach post is unique and the activities of each depend on their specific department's policies and guidelines. Typical activities include:\n\n\nAfter September 11, 2001, some Explorer posts have focused their training on counter-terrorism, border patrol, drug raids, hostage negotiation, and active shooter areas, while still teaching the above listed areas.\n\nIn some areas of the country, Explorers may go to an Explorer Academy, usually consecutive weekends or week-long to receive training and discipline, similar in nature to that of a real law enforcement academy. The academy ends with a graduation ceremony where certificates (such as CPR certification) and awards are given.\n\nSome systems may provide different levels of Academy training, such as:\n\n\nA majority of Explorer Training, including Academies are instructed by post advisers.\n\nPublic services are a chance for the Explorers to get out in public and interact with the community. Events range from crowd control at parades, to providing security and uniformed presence at events like fairs and sporting events, and directing traffic during mass traffic floods; such as those following sporting and other civic events.\n\nEvery-other year, Learning for Life hosts a National Law Enforcement Explorer Conference, which includes role-playing scenarios that law enforcement officers regularly encounter, seminars, and networking opportunities. The 2018 Conference was held at Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana.\n\nDepending on the regional structure, explorers may compete several times annually. They perform the skills they have learned (such as traffic stops, building searches, marksmanship, arrests, etc.) usually in the form of scenarios. They are graded by judges against fellow explorers from the region, country, and sometimes world.\n\nExplorers are eligible for awards and scholarships offered through Learning for Life, and through local and regional Explorer organizations.\n\nSince the mid-1970s, there have been over 100 reported cases of police officers having sex with Explorers, the vast majority of whom were underage. Such incidents have occurred in at least 66 police departments. Learning for Life has created a set of rules governing the Explorer program, which includes a non-fraternization policy between officers (or \"adult leaders\") and Explorers. However, it leaves oversight to individual departments. There are no reported cases of Learning for Life revoking a police department's ability to operate an Explorer program over failed oversight leading to one or several incidents of sexual abuse.\n\nSeveral cities, most notability Los Angeles, California, have forced their police department to disband their Explorer Program due to the Scouts’ of America’s former anti-gay policies and city laws preventing associating with businesses that discriminate. LAPD has replaced their program with the Cadet Program.\n\nIn the television series, \"\", a member of the New York Police Department Law Enforcement Explorers program jeopardizes, but then saves, a criminal case against a serial rapist.\n\nIn the television series, \"Blue Bloods\", a group of New York Police Department Law Enforcement Explorers are seen attending presentations hosted by Commissioner Francis \"Frank\" Xavier Reagan and Officer Jamison \"Jamie\" Reagan concerning the career of law enforcement.\n\n\n"}

His travel philosophy encourages people to explore less-touristed areas of destinations and to become immersed in the local people's way of life. Since 2000, he has hosted \"Rick Steves' Europe\", a travel series on public television. Steves also has a public radio travel show called \"Travel with Rick Steves\" (2005−present) and has authored numerous travel guides, the first of which was the popular \"Europe Through the Back Door\". In 2006, he became a syndicated newspaper columnist, and in 2010, his company released a mobile phone application called \"Rick Steves’ Audio Europe\" containing self-guided walking tours and geographical information.\n\nRichard John Steves Jr. was born to parents Richard John Steves, a high school band director and piano technician, and June Erna Steves (née Fremmerlid). He has two sisters, Jan and Linda. The family moved to Edmonds, Washington in 1967.\n\nWhen Steves was 14, he and his parents took a trip to Europe to see the factories that manufactured pianos, as they owned a piano store named \"Steves Sound of Music\" to which the pianos were imported and tuned. He documented what he saw and experienced on the backs of postcards which he numbered sequentially. He still has all of those cards stored in a wooden box. The family also visited relatives in Norway during the Apollo 11 moon landing, and in a park in Oslo, Steves came to a realization that would influence him throughout his life: \"This planet must be home to billions of equally lovable children of God.\" When he turned 18, he again visited Europe, but without his parents. He kept journals of all of those experiences, as well.\n\nSteves attended the University of Washington, majoring in European history and business administration, graduating in 1978.\n\nIn his 20s, Steves started teaching travel classes through The Experimental College, a student-run program of non-credit classes at his alma mater, the University of Washington, and working as a tour guide in the summer. At the time, he also worked as a piano teacher. In 1979, based on his travel classes, he wrote the first edition of \"Europe Through the Back Door\" (ETBD), a general guide on how to travel in Europe. Steves self-published the first edition of his travel skills book ETBD in 1980. The book contained a page that said \"Anyone caught reprinting any material herein for any purpose whatsoever will be thanked profusely.\" Unlike most guidebook entrepreneurs, he opened a storefront business. Initially, this was both a travel center and a piano teaching studio. He held travel classes and slide show presentations, did travel consulting, organized a few group tours per year, and updated his books. He did not provide ticket booking or other standard travel agency services. He incorporated his business as \"Rick Steves' Europe Through the Back Door.\" The store was in Steves' hometown of Edmonds, north of Seattle. The company's headquarters is still in Edmonds. Steves' first television show, \"Travels in Europe with Rick Steves,\" debuted on public television in April 1991 and ended production in 1998. His second show, \"Rick Steves' Europe,\" debuted in September 2000, and has aired episodes through 2019, though because he does not produce a season every year, this accounts for 10 seasons.\n\nSteves advocates independent travel. His books and media deal with travel mainly in Europe and are directed at an American audience. As host, writer, and producer of the popular and long-running American Public Television series \"Rick Steves' Europe\", and through his travel books, he encourages Americans to become what he calls \"temporary locals.\" He encourages his readers and viewers to visit not just major cities but also cozy villages away from popular tourist routes. Steves's television series, guidebooks, radio shows, mobile applications, and his company's European escorted bus tours attract fans known as \"Rickniks\".\n\nSteves's relationship with public television began in 1991 with his first series, \"Travels in Europe with Rick Steves\". Since then he has become one of public television's top pledge drive hosts, raising millions of dollars annually for stations across the U.S. He writes and co-produces his television programs through his own production company, Back Door Productions.\n\nSince self-publishing his first book in 1980, Steves has written country guidebooks, city and regional guides, phrase books, and co-authored \"Europe 101: History and Art for Travelers\". His guidebook to Italy is the bestselling international guidebook in the U.S. In 1999, he started writing in a new genre of travel writing with his anecdotal \"Postcards from Europe\", recounting his favorite moments from his many years of travel. Steves's books are published by Avalon Travel Publishing, a member of the Perseus Books Group. In 2009, Steves published the book \"Travel as a Political Act,\" a guide on traveling more thoughtfully.\n\nIn addition to his guidebooks and television shows, Steves has expanded into radio, newspaper and mobile applications. In 2005, Steves launched a weekly public radio program, \"Travel with Rick Steves\". Focusing on world travel, although with a heavy emphasis on Europe and North America, each program has a guest travel expert for interviews, followed by call-ins with questions and comments. In 2006, Steves became a syndicated newspaper columnist with his Tribune Content Agency column. In 2010, he launched the mobile application \"Rick Steves' Audio Europe\", a library of audio content (including self-guided walking tours) organized into geographic-specific playlists for the iPhone and Android.\n\nPolitically, Steves has identified himself as a member of the Democratic Party, and publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nSteves is a vocal proponent of legalizing cannabis and an active supporter of efforts to reform cannabis policy in the U.S. According to Steves: \"Like most of Europe, I believe marijuana is a soft drug, like alcohol and tobacco. Like alcohol and tobacco, there is no reason why it shouldn't be taxed and regulated. Crime should only enter the equation if it is abused to the point where innocent people are harmed.\"\n\nSteves serves on the Advisory Board of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. He was also a major supporter of Initiative 502 to legalize, tax, and regulate cannabis in the state of Washington. Steves hosted an ACLU-sponsored educational program called \"Marijuana: It's Time for a Conversation\", which was nominated for an Emmy.\n\nSteves also supports solutions to homelessness. In 2005, he constructed a 24-unit apartment complex in Lynnwood, Washington, called Trinity Place and administrated by the local YWCA, to provide transitional housing for homeless mothers and their children. In 2017, Steves donated that $4 million apartment complex for homeless women and kids to the YWCA. Members of the Edmonds Noontime Rotary Club help maintain the buildings and grounds, providing everything from furniture to flowers. The club also raised $30,000 to build a play structure for the children there.\n\nSteves also donates royalties from one of his books to the group Bread for the World, a movement to end hunger.\n\nA supporter of the arts, Steves gave US$1 million in 2011 to the Edmonds Center for the Arts and Cascade Symphony Orchestra.\n\nAs a lifelong traveler, Steves avows that terrorism is something Americans should get used to, a natural outgrowth of the United States' position in the global community and how it is militarily advanced. In an interview with the \"Seattle Times\", Steves said:\n\n\"I think we're 300 million people and if we lose a few hundred people a year to terrorists, that doesn't change who we are and it shouldn't change the fabric of our society. Frankly I think we should get used to losing—as long as we're taking the stance in the world of being the military superpower, you're going to have people nipping at you. And if it's hundreds or thousands—we lose 15,000 people a year to have the right to bear arms and most people think that's a good deal, year after year. We spend 15,000 people for the right to bear arms. What do we spend to be as aggressive and heavy weight on this planet? We're always going to have terrorism.\"\n\nWhen he traveled to Iran, he noted the similarity of Iranians and Americans each giving up freedoms to make themselves less fearful:\n\"They traded away their freedom for a theocracy, out of fear. It's just like Americans. We don't want to torture people, we want to have civil liberties, we don't want our government reading our mail. But when we have fear, we let fear trump our commitment to our civil liberties and decency. We allow torture, we allow the government to read our mail. It's not because we're bad, it's because sometimes fear is more important than our core values. And Iran is afraid. They've given up democracy because they know a theocracy will stand strong against encroaching Western values.\"\n\nIn \"Travel as a Political Act\", Steves wrote that displaying the American flag on car antennas \"creates a fearful, schizophrenic dynamic that may stoke today's terrorism and tomorrow's international conflicts.\"\n\nIn 2017, Steves posted on his blog, stating that he would donate $1 for every $1 spent on his website on Inauguration Day to the ACLU. According to Steves, the website had higher traffic than usual and that customers purchased $42,962 in merchandise. As a response, Steves wrote a check for $50,000 to the ACLU and stated: \"Those of us with passports and who are wealthy enough to travel a lot—especially white, straight, Christian males like me—don't often think a lot about civil liberties ... at least, not in an immediate or personal way. Civil liberties just aren't an issue for most of us. If a wealthy person is in trouble with the law, he can hire a good lawyer. It's the poor who are filling our prisons. If I want to smoke pot, no one's going to arrest me. It's poor and black people who get arrested, and then disenfranchised. I have a voice because I fit societal norms and I have money.\"\n\nIn June 2019, acknowledging that travel is a source of environmental destruction, he announced that his tour company will donate $1 million a year to a portfolio of environmental nonprofits, to mitigate the carbon emissions made from the 30,000 annual travelers who use his tour program. Critics contend that travel can never be carbon neutral and that his donations amount to being a way for the wealthy to feel better; Steves counters that if travelers prefer booking with his company due to the carbon offset, other travel companies will be forced to follow suit to stay in business.\n\nSteves is an active Lutheran Christian, and has written and hosted educational videos on subjects such as Martin Luther and the European Reformation. He supports liberation theology. He has spoken at the Lutheran Peace Fellowship. To recognize his \"outstanding service to church and society\", the Luther Institute, an affiliate of the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg, presented their Wittenberg Award to him.\n\nSteves is of Norwegian ancestry. His sister Jan is an Iditarod racer. He was married to Anne Steves until 2010, when they divorced. They are the parents of two adult children. Their son Andy Steves followed his father's footsteps and founded his own travel company, Weekend Student Adventures Europe, and wrote \"Andy Steves' Europe: City-Hopping on a Budget\". He began dating Shelley Bryan Wee, a bishop from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, in December 2019.\n\nSteves spends about a third of every year in Europe researching guidebooks and filming TV shows. His home is still in Edmonds, Washington, where he has lived since 1967.\n\n"}
{"id": "1941761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941761", "title": "Knight of the Swan", "text": "Knight of the Swan\n\nThe story of the Knight of the Swan, or Swan Knight, is a medieval tale about a mysterious rescuer who comes in a swan-drawn boat to defend a damsel, his only condition being that he must never be asked his name.\n\nThe earliest versions (preserved in \"Dolopathos\") do not provide specific identity to this knight, but the Old French Crusade cycle of \"chansons de geste\" adopted it to make the Swan Knight (\"Le Chevalier au Cigne\", first version around 1192) the legendary ancestor of Godfrey of Bouillon. The \"Chevalier au Cigne\", also known as Helias, figures as the son of Orient of L'Islefort (or Illefort) and his wife Beatrix in perhaps the most familiar version, which is the one adopted for the late fourteenth century Middle English \"Cheuelere Assigne\". The hero's mother's name may vary from Elioxe (probably a mere echo of Helias) to Beatrix depending on the text, and in a Spanish version, she is called Isomberte.\n\nAt a later time, the German poet Wolfram von Eschenbach incorporated the swan knight Loherangrin into his Arthurian epic \"Parzival\" (first quarter of the 13th century). A German text, written by Konrad von Würzburg in 1257, also featured a Swan Knight without a name. Wolfram's and Konrad's were used to construct the libretto for Richard Wagner's opera \"Lohengrin\" (Weimar 1850).\n\nAnother example of the motif is Brangemuer, the knight that lay dead in a boat tugged by a swan, and whose adventure was taken up by Gawain's brother Guerrehet (Gareth or Gaheris) in the first Continuation to Chrétien de Troyes' \"Perceval\".\n\nThe \"Swan-Children\" appears to have been originally separate from the Godfrey cycle and the Swan Knight story generally. Paris identifies four groups of variants, which he classifies usually by the name of the mother of the swan children.\n\nThe tale in all variants resemble not only such chivalric romances as \"The Man of Law's Tale\" and \"Emaré\", but such fairy tales as \"The Girl Without Hands\". It also bears resemblance to the fairy tale \"The Six Swans\", where brothers transformed into birds are rescued by the efforts of their sister.\n\nIncluded in Johannes de Alta Silva's \"Dolopathos sive de Rege et Septem Sapientibus\" (ca. 1190), a Latin version of the \"Seven Sages of Rome\" is a story of the swan children which has served as a precursor to the poems of the Crusade cycle. The tale was adapted into the French \"Li romans de Dolopathos\" by the poet Herbert. The story is as follows:\n\nA nameless young lord becomes lost in the hunt for a white stag and wanders into an enchanted forest where he encounters a mysterious woman (clearly a swan maiden or fairy) in the act of bathing, while clutching a gold necklace. They fall instantly for each other and consummate their love. The young lord brings her to his castle, and the maiden (just as she has foretold) gives birth to a septuplet, six boys and a girl, with golden chains about their necks. But her evil mother-in-law swaps the newborn with seven puppies. The servant with orders to kill the children in the forest just abandons them under a tree. The young lord is told by his wicked mother that his bride gave birth to a litter of pups, and he punishes her by burying her up to the neck for seven years. Some time later, the young lord while hunting encounters the children in the forest, and the wicked mother's lie starts to unravel. The servant is sent out to search them, and find the boys bathing in the form of swans, with their sister guarding their gold chains. The servant steals the boys' chains, preventing them from changing back to human form, and the chains are taken to a goldsmith to be melted down to make a goblet. The swan-boys land in the young lord's pond, and their sister, who can still transform back and forth into human shape by the magic of her chain, goes to the castle to obtain bread to her brothers. Eventually the young lord asks her story so the truth comes out. The goldsmith was actually unable to melt down the chains, and had kept them for himself. These are now restored back to the six boys, and they regain their powers, except one, whose chain the smith had damaged in the attempt. So he alone is stuck in swan form. The work goes on to say obliquely hints that this is the swan in the Swan Knight tale, more precisely, that this was the swan “\"quod cathena aurea militem in navicula trahat armatum\" (that tugged by a gold chain an armed knight in a boat).”\n\nThe Knight of the Swan story appears in the Old French \"chansons de geste\" of the first Crusade cycle, establishing a legendary ancestry of Godfrey of Bouillon, who in 1099 became ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Godfrey loomed large in the medieval Christian imagination, and his shadowy genealogy became a popular subject for writers of the period.\n\nThe swan-children tale occurs in the first or \"La Naissance du Chevalier au Cygne\" branch of the cycle. The texts can be classed into four versions, 1) \"Elioxe\", 2) \"Beatrix\", 3) an Elioxe-Beatrix composite, and 4) Isomberte. Of \"Isomberte\" no French copy survives, and it's known only from the Spanish \"Gran conquista de Ultramar\". \n\nElioxe follows the \"Dolopathos\" tale closest, but tells a courtlier version of the story, replacing the young lord who becomes lost with King Lothair, a ruler from beyond Hungary and the maiden with Elioxe. Lothair loses his way and stops by a fountain, and while asleep, is tended by Elioxe who comes out of the woodworks of the mountains. King Lothair decides to wed her, despite his mother's protest. However Elioxe foretells her own death giving birth to seven children, and that one of the offspring shall be king of the Orient.\n\nWhile Lothair is absent warring, the queen mother Matrosilie orders a servant to carry the children in two baskets and expose them in the forest, and prepares the lie that their mother gave birth to serpents and died from their bites. The servant however had left the children by the hermit's hut, so they survive, and seven years later are discovered by a greedy courtier named Rudemart. Allured by the gold chains the children are wearing, he obtains instruction from the queen mother to steal them, but failing to take account of their numbers, misses the chain belonging to the girl. The six boys bereft of the chains fly out in swan form, and their father Lothair issues an order of protection. The king's nephew tries to hunt one of the birds to please him, but the king in a fit hurls a gold basin which breaks. Matrosilie then provides one of the necklaces to make the repair. Eventually the truth is untangled through the sister of the swan siblings. All the boys regain human form but one. While other seek their own fortunes, one boy cannot part with his brother turned permanently into a swan, and becomes Swan Knight.\n\nIn the Beatrix variants, the woman had taunted another woman over her alleged adultery, citing a multiple birth as proof of it, and was then punished with a multiple birth of her own. In the Beatrix versions, the mother is also an avenging justice. In the Isomberte variants, the woman is a princess fleeing a hated marriage.\n\nVersion II involves the Swan Knight himself. These stories are sometimes attached to the story of the Swan Children, but sometimes appear independently, in which case no explanation of the swan is given. All of these describe a knight who appears with a swan and rescues a lady; he then disappears after a taboo is broken, but not before becoming the ancestor of an illustrious family. Sometimes this is merely a brief account to introduce a descendant. The second version of this tale is thought to have been written by the Norman trouvère Jean Renart.\n\nIn Brabant the name of the Knight of the Swan is \"Helias\". It has been suggested that this connects him to the Greek solar god, Helios, but the name is in fact a common variant of the name of the prophet Elijah, who nevertheless was connected to the Greek solar god by orthodox worship because of his association to Mount Horeb and a fire chariot.\n\nIn the early 13th century, the German poet Wolfram von Eschenbach adapted the Swan Knight motif for his epic \"Parzival\". Here the story is attached to Loherangrin, the son of the protagonist Parzival and the queen of Pelapeire Condwiramurs. As in other versions Loherangrin is a knight who arrives in a swan-pulled boat to defend a lady, in this case Elsa of Brabant. They marry, but he must leave when she breaks the taboo of asking his name.\n\nIn the late 13th century, the poet Nouhusius (Nouhuwius) adapted and expanded Wolfram's brief story into the romance \"Lohengrin\". The poet changed the title character's name slightly and added various new elements to the story, tying the Grail and Swan Knight themes into the history of the Holy Roman Empire. In the 15th century an anonymous poet again took up the story for the romance \"Lorengel\". This version omits the taboo against asking about the hero's name and origins, allowing the knight and princess a happy ending.\n\nIn 1848, Richard Wagner adapted the tale into his popular opera \"Lohengrin\", probably the work through which the Swan Knight story is best known today.\n\n\n"}

It stars Soumitra Chatterjee, who headlined numerous Ray films, and the Bangladeshi actress Bobita in her only prominent international role. Today the film features in \"The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made\". It marked the debut of the theatre star Mrityunjay Sil.\n\nThe film is set in a village in the Indian province of Bengal during World War II, and examines the effect of the Great Famine of 1943 on the villages of Bengal through the eyes of a young Brahmin doctor-teacher, Gangacharan, and his wife, Ananga. Ray shows the human scale of a cataclysmic event that killed more than 3 million people. The film unfolds at a leisurely pace that reflects the rhythms of village life, but gradually shows the breakdown of traditional village norms under the pressure of hunger and starvation.\n\n\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"moving\" and \"elegiac\". He remarks that the film \"has the impact of an epic without seeming to mean to\" and noted various connections with Ray's own \"Apu Trilogy\" (in its casting of Chatterjee and in it being an adaptation of another Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay novel). \"It is, however, very different from those early films\" he writes, \"It is the work of a director who has learned the value of narrative economy to such an extent that \"Distant Thunder,\" which is set against the backdrop of the \"manmade\" famine that wiped out 5 million people in 1943, has the simplicity of a fable.\" Tom Milne of \"Time Out\" calls the film \"[d]istant thunder, indeed; a superb film.\" Dennis Schwartz gave the film an A- and called it \"[a] gentle humanist film that informs the world that over five million died of starvation and epidemics in Bengal.\" Jay Cocks writing for \"TIME\" echoes Canby's assessment of it as a \"fable\", writing: \"Distant Thunder has the deliberate, unadorned reality of a folk tale, a fable of encroaching, enlarging catastrophe.\" He calls the film \"superb and achingly simple [...] Numbers as huge as [\"5 million\"] can be dangerous. A tragedy of such magnitude becomes an event abstracted by arithmetic. But Ray's artistry alters the scale. His concentrating on just a few victims of the famine causes such massive loss to become real, immediate. Ray makes numbers count.\"\n\nIn 2012, filmmaker Amit Dutta included the film in his personal top ten (for \"The Sight & Sound Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time\" poll).\n\n\n"}

He played college football at the University of Alabama.\n\nAn Air Force brat, Teague grew up at McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas attending Derby High School in Derby, Kansas and Sembach Air Base, before moving to Alabama and attending Jefferson Davis High School. As a senior cornerback, he was named first-team class 6A All-state and Academic All-state. He also practiced track.\n\nHe accepted a football scholarship from the University of Alabama. He was a reserve cornerback as a true freshman. He was named a starter at cornerback as a sophomore, tallying one interception.\n\nAs a junior, he was moved to free safety, where he led the conference with 6 interceptions and recorded career-highs for tackles (54) and passes defensed (11). \n\nAs a senior, he tied for the conference's lead with 6 interceptions. His 14 career interceptions were two short of the school record at the time. Teague came to be known nationally as a playmaker in the 1993 Sugar Bowl. This game marked his first interception returned for a touchdown in his college career. Five plays later, he raced downfield and caught up with sprinting wide receiver Lamar Thomas and stripped the ball from him in full stride, while maintaining possession and returning the ball upfield. Although the play was called back on an offsides penalty against Alabama, it was still successful in preventing a Hurricane touchdown, as Miami would have simply declined the penalty had the strip not taken place. It also negated Miami's effort to regain their offensive momentum: Miami was forced to punt soon afterward, and never mounted another substantial offensive threat in the Crimson Tide's 34–13 victory.\n\nTeague was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the first round (29th overall) of the 1993 NFL Draft. He started the last 12 games at free safety, making 36 tackles, 6 passes defensed, one forced fumble, one interception, 2 fumble recoveries and 5 special teams tackles. In the playoffs against the Detroit Lions, he recorded the longest interception return for a touchdown in post-season history (101 yards), and along with his 4 tackles, earned him the NFL's Defensive Player of the Week award.\n\nIn 1994, he practiced on a limited basis early in training camp due to thyroid condition, which caused a pronounced weight loss initially and later affected his conditioning. He began practicing on a full-time basis until August 4. He started 16 games, collecting 53 tackles, 3 interceptions (tied for second on the team), 13 passes defensed (third on the team) and one forced fumble.\n\nIn 1995, he started 15 games, making 72 tackles (tied for sixth on the team), 2 interceptions, 13 passes defensed and one fumble recovery. He missed one game with a broken toe.\n\nOn August 17, 1996, the Atlanta Falcons waived Teague after only a month.\n\nOn August 23, 1996, Teague was signed as a free agent by the Dallas Cowboys. He played as a nickel defensive back, before starting 8 games after Brock Marion suffered broken a shoulder blade. He finished the year with 70 tackles, 7 passes defensed, 6 special teams tackles and a career-high 4 interceptions.\n\nHis career signature game came against the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC wild-card playoff game, where he was dominant in helping the Cowboys produce a 40–15 rout. He forced turnovers on three consecutive Vikings possessions. He first denied Amp Lee of a 43-yard touchdown reception, by stripping the ball which went out of the end zone for a touchback. On the next Vikings possession he caused a Leroy Hoard fumble. He then proceeded to return an interception 29 yards for a touchdown. He received NFL Defensive Player of the Week honors.\n\nThe Cowboys couldn't re-sign him at the end of the season, because of the salary cap problems they had at the time.\n\nOn March 19, 1997, he was signed away by the Miami Dolphins as a free agent after jump-starting his career with the Cowboys. He began the season as a backup to Corey Harris. He was named the starter at free safety in the seventh game and remained there until the twelfth contest, after Calvin Jackson was moved from cornerback to safety to make room for rookie Sam Madison. He started 6 games, tallying 43 tackles, 3 passes defensed, 2 forced fumbles and 3 special teams tackles. On March 10, 1998, the Dolphins ended up waiving him at the end of the year to make room for safety Brock Marion.\n\nOn May 6, 1998, he was signed by the Dallas Cowboys as a free agent, to replace Brock Marion, who in turn had signed with the Dolphins to replace Teague. He played as a nickel defensive back, before passing Omar Stoutmire on the depth chart and being named the starter at free safety in the tenth game against the Arizona Cardinals. He registered 52 tackles (tenth on the team), 2 sacks, 6 passes defensed and 9 special teams tackles.\n\nIn 1999, he started 14 games at free safety, making 102 tackles (fourth on the team), 2 tackles for loss, 9 passes defensed, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery, 8 special teams tackles and 3 interceptions, including two returned for touchdowns. He missed 2 games with a strained neck injury.\n\nIn 2000, he started 9 games, missing the final 7 contests with a fractured right foot. He recorded 71 tackles and was on a pace to register a career-high 127 stops before he suffered his injury. He also had 5 special teams tackles. Teague is probably best remembered for a notable incident during a game against the San Francisco 49ers on September 24, In that game, 49ers wide receiver Terrell Owens caught his second touchdown pass of the game and ran to the Cowboys' star logo at midfield to celebrate as he had on the previous touchdown earlier. Teague violently shoved Owens from behind during the celebration and was ejected from the game. In 2008, the moment was named one of the ten most memorable in the history of Texas Stadium by ESPN.\n\nIn 2001, he started 16 games. On September 23, just two weeks after the September 11 attacks, as the Cowboys were taking the field to play the San Diego Chargers at Texas Stadium, Teague carried the American flag, displayed above his head. He was released in a salary cap move on February 28, 2002.\n\nOn December 9, 2016, he accepted a position as the head football coach at John Paul II High School in Plano, Texas. He previously served as the Athletic Director and football coach for June Shelton School, Harvest Christian Academy and Carrollton Christian Academy.\n"}
{"id": "1941776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941776", "title": "Houston Cougars", "text": "Houston Cougars\n\nThe Houston Cougars are the athletic teams representing the University of Houston. Informally, the Houston Cougars have also been referred to as the Coogs, UH, or simply Houston. Houston's nickname was created by early physical education instructor of the university and former head football coach of the Washington State Cougars John R. Bender, as he had grown fond of the name during his time there. The teams compete in the NCAA's Division I and the Football Bowl Subdivision as members of the American Athletic Conference.\n\nThe official school colors of the University of Houston are scarlet red and albino white, and the mascot is a cougar named Shasta. Houston's traditional rival has been Rice with whom the Cougars shared a conference for thirty-three non-consecutive years (see also Houston–Rice rivalry).\n\nHouston has had notable sports teams in its history, including Phi Slama Jama and the sixteen-time national champion men's golf team. The university's campus is home to many on-campus athletic facilities including TDECU Stadium (on the site of the former Robertson Stadium), Fertitta Center, and Darryl & Lori Schroeder Park.\n\nPrior to 1960, Houston was a member of several athletic conferences including the Lone Star Conference, Gulf Coast Conference, and Missouri Valley Conference. From 1960 until 1971, Houston competed as an independent. From 1971 until 1996, Houston's sports teams were a part of the Southwest Conference. After the dissolution of that conference in 1996, the Cougars became charter members of Conference USA. Houston remained a member of Conference USA until 2013, when they joined their current conference.\n\nThe most recently added sport was women's golf. Two players represented UH as individuals in the 2014 season (played during the 2013–14 school year), and a complete team was formed starting in the 2014–15 season.\n\nUH fielded its first varsity intercollegiate football team in 1946. The Houston Cougars football team currently competes in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision. After completing 18 seasons in C-USA in 2012, the Cougars joined the American Athletic Conference in 2013. The team played its home games at Robertson Stadium before it was closed and demolished after the 2012 season. The Cougars divided their home schedule in their first AAC season between Reliant Stadium and BBVA Compass Stadium; the new TDECU Stadium opened on the Robertson Stadium site in 2014.\n\nThe Cougars are coached by Dana Holgorsen, who was named head coach in January 2019 following the firing on December 30, 2018, of Major Applewhite, under whom the team had gone 0–3 in bowl games, including a 70–14 loss to Army.\n\nThe Houston Cougars men's basketball team represents the University of Houston in NCAA Division I men's basketball competition. The Cougars Men's basketball team plays in the American Athletic Conference. The team last played in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament in 2018. The Cougars are currently coached by Kelvin Sampson. The Cougars play their home games in the Fertitta Center, which opened during the 2018–19 season after renovation of the former Hofheinz Pavilion. During the renovation, home games were played at H&PE Arena at Texas Southern University.\n\nNotable players for the UH Men's basketball team include Basketball Hall of Famers Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler (who would win two and one NBA Championships respectively, both for the hometown Houston Rockets in 1994–95, with Olajuwon being the Finals MVP for both titles) and also were part of the legendary Cougars fraternity Phi Slama Jama, as well as Otis Birdsong and Hall of Famer Elvin Hayes (who would win one NBA Championship with the Washington Bullets in 1978). Each of these players has had his number retired. Notable coaches for the Cougars are Guy Lewis and Clyde Drexler. Notable games for the Cougars include the first nationally syndicated NCAA basketball game, known as the \"Game of the Century,\" and the NCAA National Championship Games in 1983 and 1984.\n\nThe women's team has made the NCAA Tournament in 1988, 1992, 2004, 2005, and 2011. The women played their entire 2017–18 home schedule at H&PE Arena.\n\nAlong with the university's other athletic teams, the baseball team is a member of the American Athletic Conference as a Division I team. They play their home games at Darryl & Lori Schroeder Park and are currently coached by Todd Whitting. The Houston Cougars baseball program has appeared in numerous NCAA Regionals, Super Regionals, and College World Series.\n\nThe Houston Cougars softball team is the college softball team of the University of Houston. The team is a member of the American Athletic Conference as a Division I team. Their home games are played at Cougar Softball Stadium on-campus. The team was established in 2001, and was the regular season champion of Conference USA three times. The Cougars are coached by Kristin Vesely.\n\nHouston has won 17 NCAA team national championships.\n\n\nThe University of Houston Rugby Club plays college rugby in the Red River Conference of Division 1-A Rugby against traditional rivals such as Texas, Texas Tech, Texas A&M, and TCU. The UH Rugby Club previously played Division III college rugby.\nThe UH Rugby Club is a registered organization sponsored by the UH campus recreation department.\n\nThe University of Houston Cricket Club won the 2019 National College Cricket Association championship.\n\nHouston's most meaningful current rivalry is with cross-town Rice University, which is a member of Conference USA. The Cougars and Rice Owls have competed in football, annually with a few exceptions, for a trophy known as the \"Bayou Bucket\", referencing one of the city of Houston's nicknames as the \"Bayou City.\"\n\nHistorically, the University of Texas was one of Houston's principal rivals, especially after Houston joined the now-defunct Southwest Conference. This rivalry gave rise to the Houston Cougar Paw tradition.\n\nMost of the university's major sports facilities are located along Cullen Boulevard, the central traffic artery through the campus. At times in the past, some of the university's teams have played their home games at off-campus venues such as the Astrodome and Rice Stadium. The men's golf program competes off campus because it does not have a dedicated golf course on campus. University of Houston's current sports facilities include the following:\n\n\nThe Houston Dynamo of Major League Soccer was a tenant at Robertson Stadium until 2011. The stadium hosted the MLS Western Conference Final in 2006 and 2007.\n\n"}

It is approximately by road south-east of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Randwick.\n\nMatraville is named in honour of James Matra (1746–1806), an American sailor and diplomat, who was a midshipman on the voyage by Captain James Cook to Botany Bay in 1770. Matra was born in New York, but later settled in England. Matra had walked over the area with Cook and his close friend, botanist Joseph Banks. Matra had proposed to the British government that it establish a colony at Botany Bay in 1783, and settle dispossessed American Loyalists who had to leave the United States after the American War of Independence. Matra offered to be its 'Conductor and Governor'. The Pitt administration concurred with Matra's proposal but declined to offer him the government of the intended colony. Instead he was given the post of Consul at Tangier, where he remained until his death in 1806.\nMatraville was originally reserved for the Church and Schools Corporation with income generated intended to support clergy and teachers. The school was established in 1904, thanks to the efforts of John Rowland Dacey, the state member for Botany, who had the nearby suburb of Daceyville named after him. The school was originally known as Cross Roads but Dacey suggested that the name Matra would be more appropriate in honour of James Matra. Dacey's suggestion was accepted by the Department of Education and the school and suburb became Matraville. The land at Matraville reverted to the crown in 1917 and were allocated for a settlement for soldiers returning from World War I. This parcel became one of the first large residential developments in the area – between 1918 and 1925. The Voluntary Workers Association was formed to build homes for soldiers and their families at the intersection of Anzac Parade and Beauchamp Road. The first cottage at the settlement was completed in 1919 and the residential area became known as Matraville Soldiers Garden Village. A total of ninety-three cottages were built between 1918 and 1925. Other residential projects followed including one for World War II veterans which was built in 1942 on the old Maroubra Speedway and named Coral Sea Park after the Battle of the Coral Sea. They were eventually taken over as State Government public housing. In 1977, all the cottages except one were demolished in spite of public protest; the one remaining cottage can still be seen in Somme Way. All that is left of the other cottages is a park with sections of sandstone walls and foundation stones laid by a number of people, including then Prime Minister William Morris Hughes. Matraville was gazetted as a postal area in 1911.\n\nMatraville is a suburb steeped in ANZAC history. Matraville Soldiers' Settlement Public School is surrounded by roads commemorating the battlefields of World War I. These include Amiens, Ypres, Pozieres, Beauchamp, Menin, Flanders, Amiens, Bullecourt, Bapaume, Hamel, Armentieres inter alia. One street is Lone Pine Pde, referring to the bloody battle at Gallipoli where more than 2000 Australians died. Pozieres Ave, commemorates the battle during World War I, where Australia lost as many men in six weeks as they did in the whole of the Gallipoli campaign. Other streets in the area are named after rivers, Torrens, Franklin, Namoi, Hunter, Clarence and also early Australian explorers, Cunningham, Blaxland, Lawson and Oxley. HMAS \"Oxley\" was an Oberon class submarine in the Royal Australian Navy.\nMatraville was split between Randwick and Botany Councils. When problems arose from the division in 1961, Botany Council decided to rename its portion Gilmore, to honour Australian poet Mary Gilmore (1864–1962). After the post masters general office pointed out that there already was a Gilmore, New South Wales (near Tumut), the council chose Hillsdale to honour Patrick Darcy Hills, who was the New South Wales minister for local government. It was a controversial choice since most residents believed that a name should have been chosen that reflected Australia's history.\n\nEuropean settlement in this suburb started along agricultural lines and included small farms and market gardens. Until 1859 market gardens in the district were owned and tended by Europeans. After the main wave of gold rushes in the 1850s Chinese workers moved into the district. Matraville was one of the last bastions of traditional Chinese market gardens which is listed on the State Heritage Register. By the 1920s Chinese market gardens across NSW were being squeezed out by larger scale, more modern agriculture. The gardens at Matraville continued into the 1970s when leases were rescinded by the Crown. Despite opposition from Randwick Council and local residents the gardens were bulldozed to make way for housing development.\n\nMatraville was once home to a coal-fired power plant, which was demolished in the 1980s to make way for further Port Botany expansion and a State Transit Authority bus depot, which provides services from the peninsula to the city. The only remaining part of the Bunnerong power station is called 'the Sucko', due to the 'sucking' inlet valve for water to cool the power plant. It is a popular swimming spot. In 1934 the fourth section of the La Perouse tramline was built to the power station which helped to encourage residential and industrial growth in the area.\n\nMatraville is primarily a residential area. The area has predominately low-rise housing but there is also a diverse range of retail, commercial and recreational uses. Approximately 52 per cent of all private dwellings in Matraville are separate houses, significantly higher than the Randwick City average (28 per cent).\nThe Matraville shopping centre is located in Bunnerong Road, between Beauchamp Road and Franklin Street. It offers shopping and a variety of dining experiences. There is a newly renovated Matraville Hotel and the Matraville RSL both offering contemporary Australian cuisine as well as live entertainment.\n\nThe suburb has experienced gentrification largely due to its proximity to Sydney's CBD, its famous beaches and the University of NSW all of which have resulted in an increased demand for homes in the area.\n\nLandmarks include Heffron Park, a large reserve bordering Maroubra, formerly the site of a naval stores base in World War II.\nEastern Suburbs Memorial Park sits along the southern border of the suburb and incorporates Botany Cemetery, Eastern Suburbs Crematorium and Pioneer Park. Arthur Stace, known in Sydney as Mr Eternity, is buried at Botany Cemetery. He was famous for his practice of writing the word Eternity all over Sydney during the fifties and sixties.\n\nMatraville is home to St Agnes Catholic Church and Matraville Baptist Church. Matraville also has a large Jehovah's Witness congregation with a Kingdom Hall.\n\nThere are three primary schools, one public and one Catholic and Matraville Sports High School and Matraville Public School. A child care centre and preschool is also in the suburb. Matraville Soldiers Settlement School previously had a separate Infants and Primary School which are now combined into one larger school following the acquisition of park land at Finucane Crescent.\n\nMatraville is located from Sydney CBD and along Bunnerong Road from Kingsford town centre. Sydney Bus routes operate to City – Central Railway station, Martin Place and Circular Quay via Bunnerong Road, Anzac Parade (UNSW), and Oxford Street\n\nHeffron Park bounded by Bunnerong Road, Jersey Road, Robey Street and Fitzgerald Avenue comprises many sporting facilities including The Matraville Sports Centre with its squash and tennis courts. The recently updated Des Renford Leisure Centre has a gym, a crèche, an indoor heated pool, an outdoor Olympic sized pool and 2 pools for juniors The Heffron Park sporting fields are set in extensive grasslands with a bicycle track that weaves through the entire park. The park also provides opportunities for passive recreation such as walking, jogging, kite flying and ball games. In addition nearby Matraville RSL club, provides activities such as lawn bowls, social golf, tennis, darts and snooker. The Malabar Riding school is located on Wassel Street near the Chinese Gardens. Matraville Sports High School's Rugby League Program is one of the fastest growing in schoolboy Rugby League.\n\nMatraville is close to some of Sydney's well-known beaches such as Maroubra Beach and Coogee Beach, Long Bay, Little Bay and the more sedate and secluded Congwong Beach. near the mouth of Botany Bay. Sydney Dive Academy is based at Matraville, just north of one of Sydney's scuba diving locations, Bare Island.\n\nThe Star Drive-in theatre opened in August 1958 and operated until 8 August 1984 when it closed for the last time because it was no longer profitable. No fanfare greeted the last screening and only nine cars were there to view the last film screened, \"The Exterminator\". \nDrive-ins have featured in many Australian films. The best known is movie \"Dead End Drive-In\" (1986), a satirical futuristic action film in which troublesome youth, the unemployed and unwanted immigrants are herded into a drive-in converted into a detention centre. Filming took place at Sydney's Matraville Drive-in. The Matraville Drive-in was demolished shortly after the movie was completed, joining the hundreds of Australian drive-ins to suffer a similar fate in the 1980s. Matraville also hosts a very large Christmas lights decoration in the areas around Flanders Avenue, Knowles Avenue, Franklin Street, Clarence Street and Barwon Crescent.\n\nAccording to the , the population of Matraville was 9,804: 48.6% male and 51.4% female. The median age of the Matraville population was 40 years of age, 2 years above the Australian median. In Matraville, 51.1% of households were made up of couples with children, compared with 37.9% in Randwick City. In Matraville, of all households, 73.8% were family households and 22.8% were single person households. 81.3% of households had at least one person access the internet from the dwelling.\n\nIn Matraville, 58.0% of people were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were China (excludes SARs and Taiwan) 3.7%, England 2.9%, New Zealand 2.1%, Indonesia 1.7% and Hong Kong (SAR of China) 1.3%.

It was a venture investment by developer and former owner Mills Corporation that offered many retail stores and entertainment attractions. In October 2012, Simon Property Group, into which Mills Corporation had merged, and it became a bank owned asset thus and was renamed to St. Louis Outlet Mall. As of 2019, there was a sale of the bank asset to new undisclosed owners. On May 24, 2019, Namdar Realty Group announced the closing of the mall and gave the tenants 30 days to vacate the building. The mall will be redeveloped into a sports complex called POWERplex.\n\nSt. Louis Outlet Mall is divided up into six sectors called neighborhoods; each neighborhood has a different theme that contributes to the overall design, decoration, and attractions in that area of the mall. For example, the \"SportStreet\" area features wood floors like those found on a basketball court, and had contained NASCAR Speedpark until its closure in January 2014, and Ice Zone ice skating rink, which both are sports-related attractions. Neighborhood themes include:\n\n\nEach area of the mall features decorations, artwork, and colors in line with its namesake.\n\nIce Zone (also styled iceZone) is a 1,200-seat indoor ice arena connected to the Northwest section of the mall. The arena is open to the public for skating, figure skating, and local youth, high school and adult hockey teams. It served as the official practice facility of the St. Louis Blues hockey team until relocating to the newly built Centene Community Ice Center. It offered free bleacher seating for fans during practice sessions.\n\nThe Ice Zone is also home to the Gateway Locomotives, a special needs hockey team.\n\nThe Speedpark included an indoor/outdoor go-kart race track and sometimes featured appearances by NASCAR drivers such as Kevin Harvick, having them meet with fans and sign autographs. NASCAR Speedpark closed in January 2014.\n\nThe ESPN Skate Park opened with the mall but in 2004, however the mall did not have the correct copyright agreement to use the ESPN name with the park which led it to be renamed the \"St. Louis Mills Skate Park\" in late 2005. The park then closed in early 2006 and remained closed until 2007 when a new sponsor named Woodward announced that they would take ownership. Plans for that then fell through in mid-2007 and the park continued to stay closed until it was re-opened with a new sponsor as \"Plan Nine\" in 2009. The Park closed once again in 2015.\n\n"}

{"id": "1941811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941811", "title": "I masnadieri", "text": "I masnadieri\n\nI masnadieri (\"The Bandits\" or \"The Robbers\") is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Andrea Maffei, based on the play \"Die Räuber\" by Friedrich von Schiller.\nAs Verdi became more successful in Italy, he began to receive offers from other opera houses outside the country. The London impresario Benjamin Lumley had presented \"Ernani\" in 1845 and, as a result of its success, commissioned an opera from the composer which became \"I masnadieri\". It was given its first performance at Her Majesty's Theatre on 22 July 1847 with Verdi conducting the first two performances.\n\nWhile reasonably successful there and in Italy up to the mid-1860s, the opera disappeared for about 90 years until revived in 1951. It has been revived from time to time in the 21st century.\n\nIn 1842 Lumley took over the management of Her Majesty's Theatre, the traditional home of Italian opera in London. Three years later Verdi's \"Ernani\" received its first British production at his theatre to great public acclaim, which convinced Lumley that he should commission an opera from Verdi, who was by then emerging as Italy's leading composer. Initially, the opera was to be \"Il corsaro\" based on the Byron poem of 1814, \"The Corsair\". Verdi accepted Lumley's proposal and production was scheduled for the world premiere of the new opera in the summer of 1846. Unfortunately, Verdi's health deteriorated and the premiere of the new work had to be postponed until 1847.\n\nDuring his period of recovery, one of Verdi's close friends, Andrea Maffei, a distinguished poet who had translated both Shakespeare and Schiller into Italian, suggested that \"Macbeth\" and Schiller's \"Die Räuber\" might provide suitable operatic subjects. With an offer to present a new opera in Florence, Verdi had the choice of two locations, Florence or London. In the end, the decision to present \"Macbeth\" in Florence came about because of the availability of a suitable bass, which Florence produced in the form of Felice Varesi. Thus, \"I masnadieri\" became destined for London, but with the condition that both Jenny Lind and the tenor Fraschini would be available. Maffei himself worked to complete the libretto of the Schiller opera with the composer. However, while Verdi had specified Fraschini, Budden notes that the management were not able to guarantee his presence and, besides, Muzio's \"ear to the ground for news of the London opera season\" had discovered that the preferred tenor there was Italo Gardoni who did sing the premiere.\n\nVerdi left Italy at the end of May 1847, accompanied by his long-time assistant and student Emanuele Muzio, with his work for London completed, except for the orchestration, which he left until the opera was in rehearsal. Apart from this being somewhat standard practice, another reason is noted by Gabiele Baldini in \"The Story of Giuseppe Verdi\": the composer wanted to hear \"la Lind and modify her role to suit her more exactly.\"\n\nHowever, there had already been rumblings that Lind may not be present; in a letter to Lumley in April, the composer had warned the impresario that he \"would not put up with the slightest shortcoming\" and that he would withdraw the opera \"if my opera is not put on at the proper time and with everything done as it ought to be done\" An additional issue emerged. The travelers having reached Paris, Verdi heard rumours that Lind was not willing to learn new roles and, therefore, Muzio was sent across the English Channel ahead of the composer, who waited for an assurance that the soprano was in London and willing to proceed. From London, Muzio was able to give Verdi that assurance, informing him that Lind was ready and eager to go to work. Verdi continued his journey, crossing the Channel on 5 June.\n\nLumley had assembled a cast of the highest international standard, specifically the Swedish coloratura soprano Jenny Lind, who came to create the role of Amalia, the opera's heroine. Thus, this opera became the highlight of her first season in England. After considerable persuasion Verdi agreed to conduct the premiere on 22 July 1847 and also conducted the second performance and after Verdi's departure, it was given two more times before the end of the season. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attended the first performance, together with the Duke of Wellington and every member of the British aristocracy and fashionable society who was able to gain admission.\n\nOverall, the premiere was a triumphant success for the composer himself, and the press was for the most part generous in its praise, although the critic Henry Chorley was to describe it as \"the worst opera that has been given in our time at Her Majesty's Theatre. Verdi is finally rejected\".\n\nAs Gabriele Baldini in \"The Story of Giuseppe Verdi\" examines this opera, the quality of the libretto preoccupies him over several pages, as much for the unsuitability of Maffei as a librettist as his lack of skill in crafting Schiller's story into an acceptable libretto. He stresses the fact that Maffei's strengths lay in the field of translation, mostly from the German and English literature, and Baldini sums him up as \"neither a poet nor a good man of letters ... who found himself at the centre of cultural currents to which he was contributing nothing really vital\". Implicit, therefore, is the notion - as noted in the quotation from Basevi below under \"Music\" - of whether composer and librettist were really suited to each other. Musicologist Julian Budden, who describes Maffei's libretto as \"indigestible\", agrees with this assessment when he states that, along with Salvadore Cammarano, the librettist employed by the composer for the first time in 1845 to write \"Alzira\", there was \"an exaggerated regard on Verdi's part for the librettist\" and he continues: \"such complaisance [from the composer] was a bad sign.\"\n\nWhile never entirely successful elsewhere, perhaps (at least in part) for the inconsistencies and excesses of its libretto, following its premiere performances, stagings in Italy were quite numerous until 1862, with performances having been given in about 17 Italian cities, including three in Milan (two of which were at La Scala) between 1849 and 1862. Budden notes that the opera did not do well on the continent, although it was translated into French, Hungarian and German and given in Russia under the title \"Adele di Cosenza\" \"before it joined \"Alzira\" in the limbo of Verdi's least performed operas\".\n\nFrom the 1970s on, the work has begun to reappear in the repertoire. A staged production in 1972 at the Rome Opera was recorded that November, with some outstanding singers of the era who included Boris Christoff, Gianni Raimondi, Renato Bruson and Ilva Ligabue. In New York, a concert performance was given by the Opera Orchestra of New York in February 1975. Other 1970s examples include a September 1976 performance in the Coliseo Albia in Bilbao, with Matteo Manuguerra and Cristina Deutekom appearing in major roles. La Scala in Milan presented the opera in 1978 under Riccardo Chailly.\n\nIn Australia in June/July 1980 at the Sydney Opera House Richard Bonynge conducted performances - which featured Joan Sutherland as Amalia. Nello Santi conducted a 1982 Zurich Opera production with Giorgio Zancanaro and Cristina Deutekom. In the US, the San Diego Opera staged it during their \"Verdi Festival\" in summer 1984 and brought in both Joan Sutherland and her husband. \nThere was a staging in Palermo in 2001 with Dimitra Theodossiou, Roberto Servile, and Carlo Ventre. \nRoyal Opera, Covent Garden presented a new production of the piece in 2002 which featured René Pape, Franco Farina and Dmitri Hvorostovsky.\n\"I masnadieri\" has been programmed by companies which plan to present (or have presented) every one of Verdi's operas. It appeared in Bilbao as part of the ABAO company's \"Tutto Verdi\" series during the 2003/2004 season; at the Sarasota Opera, in its \"Verdi Cycle\" series, which staged the opera in 2006; and the Teatro Regio di Parma included it in its October 2013 \"Festival Verdi\" program.\n\n\"I masnadieri\" has been in the repertoire of the Zurich Opera and the Frankfurt Opera in recent years\n, and the Teatro San Carlo in Naples staged the work in March 2012 and a DVD was made of the production, the first commercial release in that format. Further productions are planned in European opera houses.\n\n\"Scene 1: A tavern on the borders of Saxony.\"\n\nDuring a break from his studies at Dresden University, Carlo, the elder and favourite son of Count Massimiliano Moor has fallen amongst thieves, literally. He has become a member of a notorious gang of highwaymen and cut-throats who terrorise the local community by robbery, extortion and rowdy singing at all hours of the day and night.\n\nBut already Carlo has tired of living a life of depravity and longs to return home to be with Amalia, his gentle cousin and lifelong sweetheart (\"O mio castel paterno\" / \"O castle of my fathers\"). He is awaiting the reply to a letter he has sent to his father begging for forgiveness for his recent misdemeanors.\n\nRolla and the other robbers arrive with the longed-for reply from the Count. Carlo's joy soon turns to sorrow, and then anger (\"Nell'argilla maledetta\" / \"Let my wrath plunge these swords into the accursed clay\"), as he finds that the letter is not from his father but from his younger brother Francesco, who warns him not to return home because, far from having forgiven Carlo, the old Count is intent on punishing him and locking him away.\n\nCarlo renounces his former life and swears an oath to remain with his new comrades for the rest of his days.

Now only the elderly, infirm Count stands between Francesco and the family title and estates, and he has devised a plan to hasten his father's death (\"La sua lampada vitale\" / \"The lamp of his life burns low\").\n\nHe forces Arminio, one of the castle servants, to disguise himself as a soldier recently arrived with tragic 'news' of Carlo's death, and sings his cabaletta, \"Tremate, o miseri\" / \"Tremble, you wretches, you shall see me in my true terrible aspect\".\n\n\"Scene 3: Count Moor's bedroom in the castle.\"\n\nAmalia is watching over the ailing Count. Each of them is thinking affectionately of the missing Carlo (\"Lo sguardo avea degli angeli\" / \"His face had the smile of the angels\").\n\nFrancesco ushers the disguised Arminio into the room. Arminio describes how he fought alongside Carlo for King Frederick in a battle for the city of Prague, and how he saw him mortally wounded. Carlo's final act in this world was to inscribe a message, using his own blood, on the blade of his sword, that Amalia and Francesco should marry.\n\nAmalia and the Count are completely taken in; Massimiliano falls into a dead faint and Amalia, in a frenzy of hysteria, rushes offstage leaving a jubilant Francesco.\n\n\"Scene 1: A graveyard near the castle.\"\n\nSeveral months have passed since the previous scene and Amalia enters to pray at Count Massimiliano's tomb (\"Tu del mio Carlo al seno\" / \"Blessed spirit, you have flown to the bosom of my Carlo\"). In the distance can be heard the sounds of a festive banquet hosted by Francesco, the new Count.\nArminio has followed Amalia from the castle because he is overcome by guilt at his part in Francesco's wicked scheming. He just has time to reveal that both Carlo and the old Count are still alive (provoking Amalia's cabaletta \"Carlo vive? O caro accento\" / \"Carlo lives? ... O sweet words\") before he is disturbed by the arrival of Francesco and forced to flee the scene.\nFrancesco has also been searching for Amalia with the intention of asking her to marry him. Her scornful refusal provokes him into a rage and he becomes violent. Amalia pretends a change of heart and embraces him so that she can seize his dagger and fend him off before making her escape into the nearby forest.\n\n\"Scene 2: A clearing in a Bohemian forest.\"\n\nRolla has been captured in Prague and the brigands are awaiting the return of their leader, Carlo, who has gone to rescue him. The rescue is achieved, but at the same time Carlo has managed to set fire to much of the city, resulting in armed citizens pursuing him. The scene ends with Carlo exhorting his gallant band to fight like wolves to save themselves.\n\n\"Scene 1: A clearing in a Franconian forest.\"\n\nThe robbers sing of the pleasures of their criminal activities. They are now in the same forest as the distraught Amalia. Amalia fails to recognise her betrothed when he approaches her. Carlo reveals his identity, without mentioning his comrades, and there is a joyous reconciliation. Carlo is horrified when he learns of his brother's unsuccessful attack on her virtue.\n\n\"Scene 2: Another clearing in the Franconian forest.\"\n\nCarlo is alone and contemplates his dismal future (\"Di ladroni attorniato\" / \"Surrounded by robbers, fettered to crime\"). He considers suicide, but decides that he must accept his dreadful fate and live on in loneliness and misery, reviled by all decent people.\n\nArminio enters stealthily and approaches some nearby ruins. Hearing a voice within the ruins, Carlo investigates and discovers the emaciated figure of his father. Massimiliano fails to recognise his son, but nevertheless describes to him how Francesco attempted to bury him alive after his collapse on hearing of Carlo's death (\"Un ignoto tre lune or saranno\" / \"An unknown - it will be three moons ago now - told me that my Carlo had been killed\"). Fortunately Arminio saved him and has kept him hidden in the ruins where Carlo has found him.\n\nLeaving the Count, Carlo calls on his band to storm the castle and capture his evil brother.\n\n\"Scene 1: Another room in Count Moor's castle.\"\n\nFrancesco wakes after terrifying, guilt ridden nightmares (\"Pareami che sorto da lauto convito\" / \"I fancied that, having risen from a sumptuous banquet, I was sleeping ...\"). He summons the local priest who refuses him absolution for his heinous crimes. At this point the brigands are heard storming the castle and Francesco rushes out, swearing that he will defy the very fires of Hell.\n\n\"Scene 2: The second clearing in the Franconian forest.\"\n\nMassimiliano bewails Carlo's death, although he still does not recognise that the man standing in front of him is his favourite son. He blesses the \"unknown stranger\" for saving his life.\n\nThe robbers reappear and report that they had not been able to capture Francesco. This pleases Carlo who intends to change his ways. At this moment Amalia is dragged in by the brigands. Carlo is forced to admit to her, and to his father, his role as leader of the robbers. Massimiliano expresses his horror and despair, but Amalia declares that despite everything she still loves Carlo and wants to stay with him.\n\nAlthough Carlo has sworn to change his ways, he has also given his oath of lifelong allegiance to his band of robbers. He cannot allow the woman he loves to be dragged down into his world of degradation and disgrace and he cannot escape his own evil fate; he resolves this paradox by stabbing Amalia to death. Carlo rushes offstage claiming he is going in search of his own death.\n\n\"I masnadieri\" is scored for piccolo, flute, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, cimbasso, timpani, bass drum cymbals, harp, and strings.\n\nIn his essay on this opera in Grove, Roger Parker refers to the overall quality and style of the music, and notes that the opera \"contains much more fine music than is commonly supposed, but it has an unusually high proportion of solo arias\" and, therefore, fewer ensembles. It is the first early opera not to open with a chorus nor to contain a concertato finale. Budden also finds some \"fine things\" in the music and names (amongst others) the prelude, the act 1 tenor's cavatina plus the quartet in the finale and, in act 2, the choruses, plus the trio which is the finale of act 4, but comments on the fact that they appear to be \"isolated, not part of the general scheme.\"\n\nBut David Kimbell, writing in \"The New Penguin Opera Guide\" remarks on some of the features which limited its success. For example, he notes that \"the arbiters of taste in London still found Verdi's music disagreeably violent and in making the tenor the focus of dramatic interest he failed to exploit popularity enjoyed in the city by Jenny Lind\", but he goes on to state that \"Verdi fashion[ed] his music as much to match the talents of his performers as the requirements of his dramatic theme.\" In Lind, it appears that Verdi found a voice that caused him to create \"tinsel-like\" music, since (according to Muzio, with which Budden presumes Verdi agrees) it is a voice with its trills and embellishments which is \"the sort of thing which people liked in the last century [i.e. 18th century] but not in 1847.\"\n\nReferring to some of the conflicting elements of the libretto referred to above, Baldini quotes from Basevi's 1859 comment on the unsuitability of the music to the harshness of the text: \n\nNotes\nCited sources\n\nOther sources\n\n"}

He later appeared in the magazine \"Tiramolla\" on 19 July 1970. Later, the development of the character was given to one of his assistants, Silver (creator of Lupo Alberto, another successful comic strip in Italy), because Bonvi was too busy with his other works (among them, the famous Sturmtruppen). The character is a more or less declared parody of another successful series in Italy, \"Diabolik\", created by the Giussani Sisters. The character quickly became popular in Italy, his anti-heroic nature is overblown to grotesque proportions (he is a burglar and general criminal, lives in sewers, takes showers with toxic waste and hates everything \"good natured\") and politically incorrect humour (fart and burp jokes, italian politicians caricatures and social commentary).\n\nThe two main characteristics of Cattivik are the pear-shaped form (which is an evolution of the original form designed by Bonvi, which was shaped more like a giant pepperoni) and an accent (he omits the final vowels of most words) that could be both Northern-Italian or Apulian.\n\nA magazine called \"Cattivik\" was published in Italy from 1989.

{"id": "1941819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941819", "title": "Lohengrin", "text": "Lohengrin\n\nLohengrin is a character in German Arthurian literature. The son of Parzival (Percival), he is a knight of the Holy Grail sent in a boat pulled by swans to rescue a maiden who can never ask his identity. His story, which first appears in Wolfram von Eschenbach's \"Parzival\", is a version of the Knight of the Swan legend known from a variety of medieval sources. Wolfram's story was expanded in two later romances. Richard Wagner's opera \"Lohengrin\" of 1848 is based upon the legend.\n\nLohengrin first appears as \"Loherangrin\", the son of Parzival and Condwiramurs in Wolfram von Eschenbach's \"Parzival\". Wolfram's story is a variation of the Knight of the Swan tale, previously attached to the Crusade cycle of medieval literature. Loherangrin and his twin brother Kardeiz join their parents in Munsalväsche when Parzival becomes the Grail King; Kardeiz later inherits their father's secular lands, and Loherangrin remains in Munsalväsche as a Grail Knight. Members of this order are sent out in secret to provide lords to kingdoms that have lost their protectors and Loherangrin is eventually called to this duty in Brabant, where the duke has died without a male heir. His daughter Elsa fears the kingdom will be lost, but Loherangrin arrives in a boat pulled by a swan and offers to defend her, though he warns her she must never ask his name. He weds the duchess and serves Brabant for years, but one day Elsa asks the forbidden question. He explains his origin and steps back onto his swan boat, never to return.\n\nThe Knight of the Swan story was previously known from the tales of the ancestry of Godfrey of Bouillon, the first ruler of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. The story appears in the two versions of the tale \"Naissance du Chevalier au Cygne\", which describes the Swan Knight Elias arriving to defend the dispossessed Duchess of Bouillon. They marry and have a daughter, Ida, who becomes the mother of Godfrey and his brothers. The Knight of the Swan is not the only altered version of a popular story Wolfram uses in his narrative; he makes Prester John the son of his character Feirefiz.\n\nThe story was picked up and expanded in the late 13th-century \"Lohengrin\" by a certain \"Nouhusius\" or \"Nouhuwius\", who changed the character's name and tied the romance's Grail and Swan Knight elements into the history of the Holy Roman Empire. The story follows Wolfram closely but adds certain details – notably, Princess Elsa's questioning of her husband occurs only after prodding by an antagonist who spreads rumors that Lohengrin is not of noble blood – that extends the material into a full romance. In expanding the material, the author drew on several other medieval German literary works, including the \"Sächsische Weltchronik\", the \"Jüngerer Titurel\", and the \"Wartburgkrieg\". In the 15th century, the story was taken up again for the anonymous \"Lorengel\". This version does not include the taboo against asking the protagonist about his mysterious origin and Lorengel and his princess can live happily ever after.\n\nIn 1848, Richard Wagner, drawing on the contemporary work of Ludwig Lucas, adapted the tale into his popular opera \"Lohengrin\", arguably the work through which Lohengrin's story is best known today. While King Henry the Fowler tries to assemble forces in Brabant to combat the Hungarian invasions, Lohengrin appears on the Scheldt River to defend Princess Elsa from the false accusation of killing her younger brother Gottfried (who turns out to be alive and returns at the end of the opera). According to Wagner, the Grail imbues the Knight of the Swan with mystical powers that can only be maintained if their nature is kept secret; hence the danger of Elsa's question. The most famous piece from \"Lohengrin\" is the \"Bridal Chorus\" (\"Here Comes the Bride\"), still played at many Western weddings.\n\nWagner's \"Lohengrin\" was parodied in Victor Herbert's 1906 burlesque \"The Magic Knight\", and was reworked into Salvatore Sciarrino's 1982 opera \"Lohengrin\", which reduces the narrative to a manic hallucination.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1941830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941830", "title": "Aida (musical)", "text": "Aida (musical)\n\nAida (also known as \"Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida\") is a musical based on the opera of the same name written by Antonio Ghislanzoni with music by Giuseppe Verdi. It has music by Elton John, lyrics by Tim Rice, and book by Linda Woolverton, Robert Falls, and David Henry Hwang, and was originally produced by Walt Disney Theatrical.\n\n\"Aida\" premiered on Broadway on March 23, 2000, running for 1,852 performances until September 5, 2004. It was nominated for five Tony Awards and won four, including Best Original Score. It was also named by \"Time\" as one of the top ten theatre productions of the year.\n\nThe original Broadway cast recording won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album. A song from the show, \"Written in the Stars\", recorded by Elton John and LeAnn Rimes, reached No. 2 in the \"Billboard\" US adult contemporary music chart.\n\nThe show is based on Giuseppe Verdi's Italian-language opera of the same name, the libretto of which was written by Antonio Ghislanzoni. The musical originated from a children's storybook version of Verdi's opera written by the soprano Leontyne Price. The book featured illustrations by Leo and Diane Dillon. In 1994 the book rights were acquired by the Walt Disney Company for a proposed animated feature film. However, Elton John chose not to pursue another animated project after \"The Lion King\" so Disney executives suggested a Broadway adaptation instead. Despite his opinion that \"opera people can be very elitist\", John, along with Tim Rice, immediately signed on.\n\nAct 1\n\nIn the Egyptian wing of a modern museum, a man and a woman touring the exhibit catch each other's eyes. A statue of Amneris, a female Pharaoh, comes to life (\"Every Story Is a Love Story\") and transports them to Ancient Egypt, where Radames, captain of the Egyptian army, and his men are returning from an expedition through the land of Egypt's long-time enemy, Nubia (\"Fortune Favors the Brave\"). When his soldiers capture a group of Nubian women, he is captivated by one of the women, Aida, who tries to free herself by out-dueling one of his soldiers. Radames forces her to wash his back, but she refuses, saying that although the Egyptians took everything from the Nubians, they will never take their spirit (\"The Past Is Another Land\"). Radames saves Aida's companions from the copper mines (and certain death) by sending them to the palace groundskeeper instead. He also ensures Aida serves as a handmaiden to his betrothed, Princess Amneris. Radames' father, Chief Minister Zoser, greets his son with news that the Pharaoh is dying, and Radames must prepare to become the next ruler of Egypt (\"Another Pyramid\"). Unbeknownst to Radames, his father is poisoning the Pharaoh in order to accelerate Radames' ascension to the throne.\n\nRadames' Nubian servant, Mereb, is a young man who has learned the tricks of survival in Egypt. While delivering Aida to the princess, Mereb recognizes her as the daughter of the Nubian king under whom he had served during his days in Nubia. She commands him to keep her identity a secret, lest the Egyptians kill her (\"How I Know You\"). Presented to Amneris, Aida is liked immediately, and she perceives that the Princess' love of fashion only serves as a mask of her insecurities (\"My Strongest Suit\"). At a banquet, Amneris and Radames learn from the Pharaoh that they are to marry in seven days, leaving the captain distraught that his days as an explorer have ended (\"Fortune Favors the Brave (Reprise)\"). Together, he and Aida share their dreams and regrets (\"Enchantment Passing Through\").\n\nLater that night, Amneris worries about her father's illness, and finds in Aida someone who understands and encourages her (\"My Strongest Suit (Reprise)\"). Bursting into his fiancée's chamber, Radames steals a moment with Aida to share his growing attraction to her. Aida is taken by Mereb to the Nubian camp, where she reluctantly submits to her people's pleas to lead them (\"Dance of the Robe\"). When she implores Radames to help the Nubians, he opens his heart by giving his possessions to them (\"Not Me\") and declaring his love for Aida (\"Elaborate Lives\"). Unable to fight her feelings any longer, she falls into his embrace. Their bliss is interrupted by news that Radames' armies have captured Amonasro, king of Nubia and also Aida's father. Unable to comfort her, Radames leaves Aida in distress. Rallying her people, Aida assures them that Nubia will never die (\"The Gods Love Nubia\").\n\nAct 2\n\nAmneris, Radames, and Aida are entangled in conflicted loyalties and emotions (\"A Step Too Far\"): Amneris is afraid that Radames's affection for her is waning, Radames worries his love for Aida could end his life as he knows it, and Aida fears she might be a traitor to her people as she loves Radames. Aida and Mereb bribe their way into Amonasro's prison cell, where she is reunited with her father. Mereb hatches a plan to escape with the king during the commotion of Amneris' wedding. To save her father and her nation, Aida must betray the man she loves (\"Easy as Life\"). Meanwhile, Zoser discovers Radames' affair and warns his son that it could cost him the throne, but Radames no longer shares his father's ambitions (\"Like Father, Like Son\"). After an emotional bout with his son, Zoser orders his men to find Aida and kill her.\n\nAt the Nubian camp, Aida receives a written apology from Radames for the thoughtless way he acted upon hearing of Amonasro's capture (\"Radames' Letter\") and for his lack of showing affection. When Egyptian soldiers arrive seeking Aida, another Nubian, Nehebka, sacrifices herself so that the princess can live. Now even more determined to leave Radames forever, Aida goes to say good-bye to him over Mereb's objections (\"How I Know You (Reprise)\"). Radames informs Aida that he is calling off the wedding. Aida knows that this would ruin her father's escape and tells him he must go through with it (\"Written in the Stars\"). Radames agrees, on condition that she escapes to freedom on a boat he will provide. The heartbroken lovers part, but Amneris has overheard their entire conversation and tries to face the fact that her upcoming marriage is a sham (\"I Know the Truth\").\n\nNews of Amonasro's escape disrupts Amneris' wedding. Radames learns the truth of Aida's identity when he arrives at the docks just as she is about to board his boat with her father. Although he is angry that Aida hid this from him, she says she never lied about loving him. In the ensuing chaos, Mereb is mortally wounded by Zoser, and Radames makes possible Amonasro's escape by cutting the rope tied to the dock, but Aida stays with Radames and a dying Mereb. Zoser flees, and Mereb dies in the arms of his kind master and beloved princess. Radames and Aida are then arrested for treason. At the ensuing trial, Pharaoh announces Zoser's apprehension and sentences both Aida and Radames to be buried alive. Amneris foreshadows her role as a future Pharaoh by convincing her father to let the lovers die in the same tomb, an act of mercy for two people she has come to love. Facing death, Aida looks to Radames for strength (\"Elaborate Lives (Reprise)\"). As they are slowly deprived of light and air (\"Enchantment Passing Through (Reprise)\"), Radames swears he will search through a hundred lifetimes to find her again if he has to.\n\nBack in the contemporary museum, the spirit of Amneris reveals that as she became Pharaoh, \"the lovers' deaths gave birth to a reign of peace\" between Egypt and Nubia. She watches as the modern man and woman are strangely drawn to each other. They are the reincarnations of Aida and Radames, finding each other in a new beginning (\"Every Story is a Love Story (Reprise)\").\n\n\"Aida\" was originally conceived for production as an animated musical film by Disney executives, who wanted to do another project with the collaborative team of Sir Elton John and Sir Tim Rice, following the success enjoyed by the animated film \"The Lion King\". It was John's idea to develop the story directly as a musical, and a first reading was presented to Disney executives on April 1, 1996. John also recorded multiple demos of the original songs, which were never released but were widely bootlegged. Early readings featured Simone (Aida), Hank Stratton (Radames) and Sherie Rene Scott (Amneris). It took 2 1/2 years from first reading to the first full production presentation in September 1998 in Atlanta. One of the many issues was what to call the musical.\n\n\"Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida\" had its world premiere at the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia, where it ran from September 16 to November 8, 1998. The Atlanta production featured Heather Headley (Aida), Hank Stratton (Radames) and Sherie Rene Scott (Amneris). The production featured several songs which were cut from the final production. The original Atlanta staging conceived of the play with a nearly empty set, displaying only a six-ton gold pyramid-shaped set piece in the center. Driven by hydraulic controls, the pyramid's sides and bottom could be turned and rotated to suggest various locations. However, the piece - constructed at a price of nearly $10 million - frequently broke down, and a new production designer was hired for restaging in Chicago. Nothing of the original Atlanta set design remained in the new production.\n\nA new, revised production opened on November 12, 1999, at the Cadillac Palace in Chicago, and ran through January 9, 2000. \"Aida\" producers made substantial changes to its team for the Chicago production. From the Atlanta staging, only Headley as Aida and Rene Scott as Amneris remained in principal roles. Ensemble members Raymond Rodriguez, Kenya Massey and Kyra Little remained from the Atlanta staging as well. Adam Pascal joined the cast as Radames, starting with the Chicago run. Robert Falls took over as director in Chicago, replacing Robert Jess Ross, and set designer Bob Crowley replaced Stanley A. Meyer. Also part of the new Chicago team was choreographer Wayne Cilento. The Chicago production featured one number \"Our Nation Holds Sway\", originally performed near the beginning of both act 1 and act 2, which was cut from the final Broadway production.\n\nDuring the Chicago run at the Cadillac Theatre, on November 13, 1999, a set mishap during the final moments of the performance injured stars Headley and Pascal. According to an eyewitness report, while the two actors were being conveyed in a suspended boxlike ‘tomb’ at the climax of the show, the set-piece fell from its support, eight feet above the stage. A subsequent press release from the show's publicist stated that Headley and Pascal sustained minor injuries and were taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for examination. Both were released from the hospital a few hours later. From then on, the tomb remained on the ground.\n\nThe musical, now titled \"Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida\", premiered on Broadway at the Palace Theatre on March 23, 2000 and closed on September 5, 2004 after 30 previews and 1,852 performances. The run puts it at the 39th longest run in Broadway history. The Broadway production was directed by Robert Falls and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, with scenery and costume design by Bob Crowley, lighting design by Natasha Katz, and sound design by Steve C. Kennedy. Considered by its producers to be a financial success, \"Aida\" on Broadway recovered its investment in 99 weeks, and generated a profit of $12 million.\n\nHeather Headley originated the title role of Aida, and won both the Tony Award and the Drama Desk Award for Best Actress in a Musical in 2000 for her performance; Headley also received broad critical acclaim. Adam Pascal played the role of Radames in both the OBC and closing productions of \"Aida\" on Broadway. Sherie René Scott, who was with the project since its first workshop, originated the role of Amneris, and was named the Most Promising Actress in 2000 for her performance (Clarence Derwent Award). The cast also included Tyrees Allen (Amonasro), John Hickok (Zoser), Daniel Oreskes (Pharaoh), Damian Perkins (Mereb), and Schele Williams (Nehebka).\n\nPop stars, including Deborah Cox, Toni Braxton and Michelle Williams played the title role of Aida during its run on Broadway, as well as Maya Days, Saycon Sengbloh, Simone and Merle Dandridge. Notable replacements for Radames included Will Chase, Patrick Cassidy, Richard H. Blake, William Robert Gaynor, and Matt Bogart. Notable replacements for Amneris included Idina Menzel, Jessica Hendy, Mandy Gonzalez, Felicia Finley, Taylor Dayne and Lisa Brescia. Notable replacements for Zoser were Micky Dolenz and Donnie Kehr. Notable Replacements for Mereb were J. Marshall Evans and Julian Bass.\n\n\"Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida\" had a critically acclaimed US National tour from March 2001 to 2003. The show received eight nominations and won five awards in 2002. including Best Musical, Best Actress (Simone), and Best Actor (Patrick Cassidy) from the National Broadway Theatre Awards (now called \"Touring Broadway Awards\"). The National tour also featured Kelli Fournier (Amneris). Notable replacements included Jeremy Kushnier (Radames) and Lisa Brescia (Amneris).\n\nThe musical also had a non-equity US national tour during 2006–07 featuring Marja Harmon (Aida), Casey Elliott (Radames), and Leah Allers (Amneris). This production had a revised script by David Henry Hwang authorized by Disney. The new script was considered to be more serious and darker, with much of the shticky and comedic elements removed from Amneris' character especially. “Strongest Suit” was staged as a scene in which Aida helped Amneris choose her outfit for the evening instead of a random fashion show. The scene prior to “Strongest Suit (Reprise)” was revised with Aida teaching Amneris how to thread, adding more a sense of bond between the women and also humbling Amneris in wanting to learn something new and not just 'be a princess.' Introduced to the plot was the revelation that Radames' mother was a prostitute and that Zoser treated her as such, and fought and schemed for Radames to achieve his position of Captain of Pharaoh's armies.\n\nThe first international production of \"Aida\" ran in Scheveningen, Netherlands. The show ran from October 10, 2001, to August 3, 2003, and was performed in Dutch. This production featured Chaira Borderslee (Aida), Bastiaan Ragas (Radames) and Antje Monteiro (Amneris). There have been also productions of \"Aida\" in Germany, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea, Uruguay, Poland, Singapore, Australia, Philippines, Mexico, Croatia, Peru, Argentina, Estonia, Canada, Hungary, Brazil, Sweden, Denmark, China, Israel and the Czech Republic. Aida was premiered in New Zealand at St Peter's School (Cambridge) (May 2012, at St Peter's College, Auckland (in 2013) and at Saint Kentigern College, Auckland in (2012). The original Japanese production has re-opened and is currently playing in Osaka, Japan.\n\n\"Aida\" has been translated into 16 languages: German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Dutch, Spanish, Estonian, French, Hungarian, Croatian, Portuguese, Swedish, Danish, Hebrew, Czech and Polish (in 2019).\n\n\"Aida\" was due to play in Jerusalem, Israel in January–February 2014 at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Beit Hillel theatre, directed by Michael Berl.\n\n\"Aida\" has been produced twice in Lima, Peru at \"Colegio Villa María\"'s Trinity Hall. It was first produced in 2005, receiving praise from the Peruvian media. It was staged for a second time in 2015. In both occasions directed by Manuel Ramírez-Gastón, \"Aida\" is one of Villa María's critically acclaimed productions of the past ten years.\n\n\"Aida\" has never been staged professionally in London or elsewhere in the UK – home of both its composer and lyricist – although it has been available for amateur licensing since 2011. Its first major performance in the UK was in March 2013 at the ADC Theatre by the Cambridge University Musical Theatre Society.\n\nA number of recordings are available for \"Aida\":\n\n\nElton John's score for \"Aida\" is stylistically eclectic. \"Another Pyramid\" is a modern reggae number; \"My Strongest Suit\" draws heavily on Motown, \"The Gods Love Nubia\" draws on gospel. There are numbers, e.g., \"Not Me\", \"Elaborate Lives\", \"A Step Too Far\", \"Written in the Stars\", that reflect Elton John's pop style. There is also a strong influence of African music, notably in \"Dance of the Robe\" and \"Easy as Life\". These styles are used without much attention to historical authenticity; rather, there is a mix of African (mostly West African), Indian and Middle Eastern influences. Probably the nearest stylistic parallel to the work as a whole is to Elton John's \"The Lion King\", another musical with strong emphasis on ethnically diverse stylistic influences.\n\nAmong the songs cut from the production after previews and workshops were two songs that made up the final sequence of the play: a reprise of \"Fortune Favors The Brave\" entitled \"The Two Must Die\", and then a final death duet for Aida and Radames, entitled \"The Messenger\". These songs were replaced with reprises of \"Elaborate Lives\", \"Enchantment Passing Through\" and \"Every Story Is A Love Story\".\n\nLeontyne Price's original storybook version of the show had first been acquired by Disney with the intention that it should become an animated film, but it was never made.

However, the artist of that piece Ben Balistreri has stated that \"This was nothing more than a class assignment given out by Frank Terry when I was at Cal Arts back in 1996...

In July 2007, it was reported that Beyoncé was attached to portray the title role, alongside Christina Aguilera as Amneris.

{"id": "1941836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941836", "title": "Ode on Melancholy", "text": "Ode on Melancholy\n\n\"Ode on Melancholy\" is one of five odes composed by English poet John Keats in the spring of 1819, along with \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Ode to a Nightingale\", \"Ode on Indolence\", and \"Ode to Psyche\". The narrative of the poem describes the poet's perception of melancholy through a lyric discourse between the poet and the reader, along with the introduction to Ancient Grecian characters and ideals.\n\nWhile studying at Enfield, Keats attempted to gain a knowledge of Grecian art from translations of Tooke's \"Pantheon\", Lempriere's \"Classical Dictionary\" and Spence's \"Polymetis\". Although Keats attempted to learn Ancient Greek, the majority of his understanding of Grecian mythology came from the translations into English. \"Ode on Melancholy\" contains references to classical themes, characters, and places such as Psyche, Lethe, and Proserpine in its description of melancholy, as allusions to Grecian art and literature were common among the \"five great odes\".\n\nUnlike the speaker of \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Ode to a Nightingale\", and \"Ode to Psyche\", the speaker of \"Ode on Melancholy\" speaks directly to the reader rather than to an object or an emotion. With only three stanzas, the poem is the shortest of the odes Keats wrote in 1819; however, the original first stanza of the poem was removed before the poem's publication in 1820. It was:\nAccording to Harold Bloom, one can presume that the \"harmony was threatened if fully half of [the poem] was concerned with the useless quest after \"The Melancholy\". Despite its adjusted length, Keats thought the poem to be of a higher quality than \"Ode on Indolence\", which was not published until 1848, after Keats's death.\n\n\"Ode on Melancholy\" consists of three stanzas with ten lines each. Because the poem has fewer stanzas than \"Ode on Indolence\" and \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", the rhyme scheme appears less elaborate, with the first and second stanzas sharing a rhyme scheme of: ABABCDECDE, while the third takes on one of its own: ABABCDEDCE. As with \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Ode on Indolence\", and \"To Autumn\", each stanza begins with an ABAB rhyme scheme then finishes with a Miltonic sestet. The general meter of the poem is iambic pentameter.\n\nPersonification is implemented with words such as 'Joy', 'Beauty', 'Delight', and 'Pleasure' allowing the poet to create characters out of ideals and emotions as he describes his thoughts and reactions to feelings of melancholy. The difference between the personification of these words and those in the other odes Keats wrote in 1819 comes from the fact that while the poet describes them as human, he declines to interact with them. Keats himself fails to appear in the poem, which creates what Andrew Bennett describes as a separation between the author, the poet, and the reader. In \"Reading Voices\", Garrett Stewart reaffirms Bennett's assertion that Keats's voice never appears in the poem itself when he says, \"For all the florid staginess of his conceits, there is, in short, no mention of writing, of the melancholic as a writer.\"\n\nNegative capability appears subtly in \"Ode on Melancholy\" according to Harold Bloom, who describes the negatives in the poem as being the result of a carefully crafted ironies that first become truly evident as the poet describes the onset of melancholy through an allegorical image of April rains supplying life to flowers. The use of the \"droop-headed flowers\" (line 13) to describe the onset of an ill-temper, according to Bloom, represents a \"passionate\" attempt by the poet to describe the proper reaction to melancholy. In the original first stanza, the \"Gothicizing\" of the ideal of melancholy strikes Bloom as more ironical and humorous, but with the removal of that text, the image of the \"droop-headed flowers\" loses the irony it would otherwise contain, and in doing so subverts the negative capability seen in \"Ode to a Nightingale\", yet Bloom states that the true negativity becomes clear in the final stanza's discussion of Beauty. The final stanza begins: \nwhich he suggests supplies the ultimate case of a negative relationship because it suggests that the only true beauty is one that will die. But Thomas McFarland, while acknowledging the importance of the original first stanza to Keats's endeavor, openly praises the removal of the lines as an act of what he calls \"compression\". McFarland believes that the poem's strength lies in its ability to avoid the \"Seemingly endless wordage of \"Endymion\" and lets the final stanza push the main themes on its own. By removing unnecessary information such as the reason the poet suggests the trip to Lethe, Keats allows the reader to avoid the \"fancy\" aspects that would have appeared in the first line and were not sustained throughout the rest of the text.\n\nAlthough the poem contains no overt sexual references, allegations of a hidden sexuality in the poem's text appear in Christopher John Murray's \"Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era.\" Murray suggests that the poem instructs the reader to approach melancholy in a manner that will result in the most pleasurable outcome for the reader. The words \"burst Joy's Grape\" in line 28 lead Daniel Brass to state: The height of the joy, the moment when the world can improve no further, is both the end of joy and the beginning of melancholy. A climax implies a dénouement, and 'bursting Joy's grape' involves both the experience of ultimate satisfaction, with the powerful image of the juice bursting forth from a burst grape, and the beginning of a decline. In \"The Masks of Keats\", Thomas McFarland suggests that Keats's beautiful words and images attempt to combine the non-beautiful subject of melancholy with the beauty inherent in the form of the ode. He too writes that the images of the bursting grape and the \"globèd peonies\" show an intention by the poet to bring the subject of sexuality into the discussion on melancholy.\n\n"}

A full tang may or may not be as wide as the handle itself, but will still run the full length of the handle.\n\nThere are a wide variety of full and partial tang designs. In perhaps the most common design in full tang knives, the handle is cut in the shape of the tang and handle scales are then fastened to the tang by means of pins, screws, bolts, metal tubing, epoxy, etc. The tang is left exposed along the belly, butt, and spine of the handle, extending both the full length and width of the handle.\n\nPartial tang designs include stub, half, and three-quarter tangs, describing how far the tang extends into the handle of the tool. The most common partial tang design found in commercial knives is on folding knives, where the tang extends only as far as the pivot-point in the handle. Scalpels, utility razor blades, and a number of other knives are commonly designed with short partial tangs that are easy to fasten and unfasten from the handle so that dull or contaminated blades may be quickly exchanged for fresh ones, or so that one style of blade may be exchanged for another style while maintaining the same handle. Hollow-handled knives also incorporate a partial tang. Many inexpensive knives and swords designed for decorative purposes incorporate partial tangs and are not intended to be used for cutting applications.\n\nA full tang knife or sword generally allows for increased force leveraged through the handle against the resistance of material being cut by the blade, an advantage when used against harder materials or when the blade begins to dull. A full tang also increases the amount of stock metal in the handle of the tool which can be beneficial in altering the balance point of the tool since the blade of a knife or sword is often quite heavy compared to the handle. Adding weight to the handle of a knife or sword to offset the weight of the blade moves the rotational balance point back toward the hand where it can be more easily manipulated to great effect, making for a nimble, agile tool. In general, a forward-balanced blade excels at chopping but sacrifices agility and ease of manipulation; a centre or rear-balanced blade excels at agility but sacrifices raw chopping power. Knives and swords intended for specific purposes will usually incorporate whichever design is most suited to how the tool will be handled for that specific purpose.\n\nA partial tang knife or sword is generally not able to leverage as much force against the resistance of material being cut as a full tang design would allow. This limits the amount of force which a user should apply to the handle of such a weapon. Such designs may be optimal in light-weight knives or swords designed to be kept extremely sharp and used to cut less-resistant materials. Scalpels and Japanese samurai swords are perhaps the most well-known examples of such tools.\n\nMost of these design styles can be used with full or partial tangs and the use of one does not exclude the use of another. For example, a sword may have a hidden, encapsulated, rat-tail tang.\n\n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1953 to 1962 as a Progressive Conservative, and held several cabinet posts in the government of Dufferin (Duff) Roblin.\n\nThompson received a Bachelor of Arts from Brandon College, which he attended with Tommy Douglas and Stanley Knowles in the late 1920s. On graduation, he went on to study law at the University of Manitoba, graduating in 1933 with an LLB. While there he was a member of the top debating team with his debating partner and the future Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) leader Lloyd Stinson.\n\nAfter graduation, he settled back in Elkhorn and built up his law practice. Active in the Elkhorn community, Thompson was a municipal councillor from 1933 to 1939. Turning to national politics, he campaigned in the 1940 federal election as a \"National Government\" (i.e., Conservative) candidate, but lost to the Liberal, James Ewen Matthews.\n\nShortly after marrying Lorraine Dutton of Virden in 1942, Thompson joined the Royal Canadian Air Force and for three years was a leading airman during the Second World War. After the war, Thompson again focused on local politics in Elkhorn and was elected as a school trustee from 1945 to 1947, and then spent six years as Mayor of Elkhorn from 1947 to 1953 (his father, Wellington John Thompson, had also been Mayor of Elkhorn in 1922, and was editor of the local newspaper, \"The Elkhorn Advocate\").\n\nThompson was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the June 1953 provincial election as the Progressive Conservative member for Virden. Despite the Liberal-Progressives winning a majority under Douglas L. Campbell, Thompson, with 57% of the vote, had defeated G.A. Mooney to become the first Tory to serve Virden since 1914. Joining the opposition benches, Thompson soon established himself as one of the best speakers in the House. When Duff Roblin assumed the party leadership the following year, Thompson was a key voice of the opposition attacks during the 1956 beer price debate, the oil lease scandal of 1957, and was a sharp critic on penal reform.\n\nThe Progressive Conservatives took power in 1958 after winning a minority government under Roblin. With 64% of the vote Thompson was re-elected in a redistributed Virden constituency, where he defeated the Liberal-Progressive incumbent Francis C. Bell. As the Tories assumed office on June 30, 1958, Thompson was a surprise choice by Roblin for Minister of Labour. Having had no experience in labour relations, Thompson had been tipped as a possible choice for Attorney-General, which instead went to Sterling Lyon. However, Roblin saw in Thompson a \"born conciliator\" who \"never failed to deliver a cogent and effective argument\". As Minister of Labour, Thompson declared his major task as the \"welfare of the worker\". He was also named Minister of Municipal Affairs.\n\nAt the end of March 1959, following heated debates regarding the upcoming fiscal budget, the government lost the confidence of the legislature and fresh elections were called for June. Easily re-elected in the May 1959 election with 68% of the Virden vote, Thompson continued to hold his Labour and Municipal Affairs portfolios.\n\nAs the end of 1959 approached, Roblin and the Deputy Premier and former party leader Errick Willis were discussing the timing of Willis' departure and next post. Willis resigned his office on December 21, 1959, and Roblin then appointed Thompson to move from Labour and pick up the Public Works portfolio. Three weeks later, Willis was appointed as Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba. Thompson stayed as Minister of Public Works for the remainder of his time in office.\n\nAs an election drew near in fall 1962, and after nine years in the Legislature, Thompson decided not to seek re-election. He resigned his portfolio and his seat on October 24, 1962, and was appointed a County Court Judge. The Progressive Conservatives went on to a second majority victory that December under Roblin.\n\nJudge Thompson then served the southern and eastern Manitoba judicial districts for more than twenty years, retiring from the bench in 1983. He died of cancer on December 15, 1986, in Winnipeg.\n\nCited\nGeneral\n"}

He is best known for his collaborations with Oscar-winning film director Satyajit Ray, with whom he worked in fourteen films. Soumitra Chattopadhyay is also the first Indian film personality conferred with the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, France's highest award for artists. He is also the winner of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award which is India's highest award for cinema. In 2018 exactly thirty years after auteur Satyajit Ray was honoured with France's highest civilian award, the coveted Legion of Honor, thespian Soumitra Chatterjee, arguably, the most prominent face of Ray's films, also received the prestigious award as the first ever Indian actor.\n\nStarting with his debut film, \"Apur Sansar\" (The World of Apu, 1959), the third part of \"Apu Trilogy\", he went on to work in several notable films with Ray, including \"Abhijan\" (The Expedition, 1962), \"Charulata\" (The Lonely Wife, 1964), \"Aranyer Din Ratri\" (Days and Nights in the Forest, 1969); \"Ashani Sanket\" (Distant Thunder, 1973); \"Sonar Kella\" (The Fortress, 1974) as Feluda and \"Joi Baba Felunath\" (The Elephant God, 1978) as Feluda; Heerak Rajar Deshe(1980), \"Ghare Baire\" (The Home and The World, 1984) and \"Ganashatru\" (Enemy of the People, 1989).

He acted more than 210 films in his career till 2016. He also received critical favour for his directorial venture \"Streer Patra\" which is based on the story of the same name by Tagore.\n\nHe was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India in 2004.\n\nIn 2012, he received the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, India's highest award in cinema given by the government of India for lifetime achievement. He has won two National Film Awards as an actor, and as an actor in Bengali theatre, he received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1998, given by the Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy of Music, Dance and Drama. In 2013, IBN LIVE named him as one of \"The men who changed the face of the Indian Cinema\". In 2014, he received the introductory Filmfare Awards East for Best Male Actor (Critics) for his role in \"Rupkatha Noy\". He won 7 Filmfare Awards. In 2006 he won the National Film Award for Best Actor for the film Podokkhep.\nSoumitra was born in Mirjapur Street (now this is known as Surya Sen Street) near Sealdah Railway Station, a locality in Calcutta of West Bengal, in 1935. The first ten years of his early life past in Krishnanagar in the district of Nadia in West Bengal, the town under the influence of playwright Dwijendralal Ray, also from Krishnanagar, had a flourishing theatre culture, with numerous small theatre groups. His grandfather was the president of one such group while his father, though lawyer by profession and later a government worker, also worked as an amateur actor. He started acting in school plays. Encouraged by the praise he received for his acting, gradually his interest in theatre grew with passing years, thus in late school years, he was taking acting seriously. He was a very close friend of famous theatre personality, Mrityunjay Sil who is often regarded as the person due to which Soumitra is a star.\n\nSoumitra and his family moved to Howrah where he studied in the Howrah Zilla School and Calcutta during his early years. Soumitra graduated from the City College, Kolkata with honours in Bengali literature, as a graduating student of the University of Calcutta. He has lived for a number of years in Calcutta in Satyajit Ray's old apartment 3-lake temple road. He studied for his M.A. in Bengali from the University of Calcutta. While still a student, he learnt acting under noted actor-director of Bengali theatre Ahindra Choudhury. However a turning point came when in the final year of college he saw a play by Sisir Bhaduri, theatre director and the doyen of Bengali theatre. The play not only set a standard for acting for him, but also help makeup his mind to become an actor. He managed to meet Bhaduri, through his friend's mother, actress Shefalika Putul. Though, he met Bhaduri, towards the end of his career, when his theatre had closed, nevertheless over the next three years, till Bhaduri's death in 1959, Chatterjee made him a mentor, and learnt the craft of acting through their regular interactions. He even appeared in a small role in one of Bhaduri's productions. \n\nSubsequently, he started his career working in All India Radio as an announcer, while he was still there he started pursuing a career in films. He came in touch with Ray during the casting for \"Aparajito\" (1956), who was looking for new faces. Ray thought he had the right look, however found him, age 20, and just out of college, too old for the role of adolescent Apu. Ray remembered him and offered him the role of adult Apu two years later. Meanwhile, he was rejected in his screen test for Bengali film, \"Nilachale Mahaprabhu\" (1957) directed by Kartik Chattopadhyay.\n\nChatterjee had gone on the sets of Ray's fourth film, \"Jalsaghar\" (1958) to watch the shoot. He was still unaware that he had already been selected for the title role of Apu trilogy. That day, while he was leaving the sets, Ray called him over and introduced him to actor Chhabi Biswas as \"..This is Soumitra Chattopadhyay; he's playing Apu in my next film \"Apur Sansar\"\" leaving him much surprised. Despite being selected, as a debutant actor, Chatterjee was nevertheless unsure for his career choice and especially his looks, as he didn't consider himself photogenic. However, on 9 August 1958, when the first shot of the film was given an okay in one take, he realized he had found his vocation. Thus Soumitra's film debut came in 1959 in Satyajit Ray's \"The World of Apu\" (Apur Sansar). In fact Ray believed with a beard Chatterjee looked like young poet laureate Tagore.\n\nSoumitra would eventually collaborate with Ray on fourteen films. His centrality to Ray's work is akin to other key collaborations in the history of cinema — Mifune and Kurosawa, Mastroianni and Fellini, De Niro and Scorsese, DiCaprio and Scorsese, Max von Sydow and Ingmar Bergman, Jerzy Stuhr and Kieślowski. After \"Apur Sansar\", he also worked with Sharmila Tagore in a number of Ray films, apart from working with leading star actor of the period, Uttam Kumar with whom he has often been compared, in eight films.\n\nChatterjee was cast in diverse roles by Ray and some of the stories and screenplays that Ray wrote were said to be written with him in mind. Soumitra featured as \"Feluda/Pradosh Chandra Mitter\", the famous private investigator from Calcutta in Ray's \"Feluda\" series of books, in two films in the 1970s \"Sonar Kella\" (1974) and \"Joi Baba Felunath\" (1979). These two films were the first film series made for Feluda and are considered as the Feluda original film series. He was the first person who portrayed the iconic Bengali sleuth Feluda. Satyajit Ray made some illustrations of Feluda based on Soumitra's body figure and look in the 1970s Feluda books. After him Sabyasachi Chakrabarty took the role of the iconic Bengali hero Feluda in the mid-1990s.\n\n\"Ghare Baire\" (1984), an adaptation of Rabindranath Tagore's novel of the same name and one of Ray's major ventures of the 1980s, featured Chatterjee in a leading role in the character of a radical revolutionary in a love triangle with his friend's wife. These roles showcased Chatterjee's versatility in playing diverse characters, especially in an urban setting. In \"Shakha Proshakha\" (1990), Ray's second last film, Chatterjee turns out a moving performance in the role of a mentally handicapped son of an aging patriarch on his deathbed and the only source of his father's solace, as his siblings squabble.\n\nSoumitra had approached Satyajit Ray to suggest a name for a little magazine founded by Soumitra and Nirmalya Acharya in 1961. Satyajit Ray had named the magazine \"Ekkhon\" (Now), he designed the inaugural cover page and illustrated the cover pages regularly even after Soumitra had stopped editing the magazine. Nirmalya continued editing the magazine, and several of Ray's scripts were published in the magazine. \n\nBesides working with Ray, Soumitra excelled in collaborations with other well-known Bengali directors such as Mrinal Sen and Tapan Sinha. He earned critical acclaim for his role of an impostor in Mrinal Sen's \"Akash Kusum\" (1965). He was equally confident in playing the swashbuckling horse-riding villain in Tapan Sinha's \"Jhinder Bandi\" (1961) giving the legendary Uttam Kumar a tough challenge. In \"Teen Bhubaner Pare\" (1969), he again shared the screen with the Tanuja, and his flamboyant and peppy way of romance. Besides films, Chatterjee has continued acting in Kolkata-based Bengali theatre, and even published over 12 poetry books.\n\nEntering the 1980s and 1990s, he started working with contemporary directors, like Goutam Ghose, Aparna Sen, Anjan Das and Rituparno Ghosh, and even acted on television. In 1986, he played the role of a swimming coach in film \"Kony\" (1986) directed by Saroj Dey, who was part of the film collective Agragami. The film is about a young girl from a slum, who wants to become a swimmer. At the 32nd National Film Awards, the film won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment . Later in a 2012 interview, he called Kony one of the best films of his career. He even recalled using film's catch-phrase \"Fight-Koni-fight\" in hard times, as a chant to himself to lift his \"aging spirits\". The phrase had become popular with middle-class Bengalis at the time.\n\nHe replaced Mrityunjay Sil as the lead artist in 1958. Mrityunjay Sil was at the peak of his theatre career at that time. But due to personal issues he suggested his friend, Soumitra's name. Mrityunjay Sil is often credited to be one of the few people to have helped Soumitra. But he soon left his job.\n\nAfter a two-decade long busy career as a leading man of Bengali cinema, he returned to theatre in 1978, with his production \"Naam Jiban\", staged at Biswarupa Theatre in Kolkata. This led to other plays like \"Rajkumar\" (1982), \"Phera\" (1987), \"Nilkantha\" (1988), \"Ghatak Biday\" (1990) and \"Nyaymurti\" (1996), beside notable plays like \"Tiktiki\" (1995), an adaptation of \"Sleuth\" and \"Homapakhi\" (2006). Besides acting, he has written and directed several plays, translated a few and also branched out to poetry reading in recent decades.\n\nSince November 2010, he has been regularly performing in the title role of the play \"Raja Lear\" directed by Suman Mukhopadhyay, a play based on King Lear by William Shakespeare. Soumitra has received widespread critical and popular accolades for his acting in the play.\n\nSoumitra Chatterjee is also well known for his poetry recitation. Recitation is something that was imbibed in him since childhood by his Parents. One such popular recitation of his is \"Shesher Kobita\" by Rabindranath Tagore.\n\nSoumitra has received the 'Officier des Arts et Metiers', the highest award for arts given by the French government, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from Italy. He turned down the honorary Padma Shri award from the Indian government in the 1970s ; in 2004, he accepted the prestigious Padma Bhushan award from the President of India. He has been the subject of a full-length documentary named \"Gaach\" by French film director Catherine Berge. In 1998, he was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award given by the Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy of Music, Dance & Drama.\n\nIncidentally, besides getting 8 times BFJA - Best Actor Awards and international recognition for his acting prowess, Chatterjee never won a National Film Award for acting in the early part of his career, which established his reputation as an actor, working with directors like Satyajit Ray, Tapan Sinha and Mrinal Sen. Thus, over the years, he has been vocal about his feelings of disappointment and alleging bias in the National Film Awards committee's towards awarding popular and mainstream cinema. Thus, in a gesture of protest against, he turned down the 2001 Special Jury Award for \"Dekha\" directed by Goutam Ghose. Later in an interview he stated \"..the National Film Awards, overlooked my performances in several powerful roles...When I did \"Kony\", Shashi Kapoor was adjudged the best actor. Anil Kapoor was feted (Best Actor) for \"Pukar\" while \"Dekha\" was awarded a 'consolation' prize\".\n\nHowever, after receiving the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian honour given by Government of India in 2004, he changed his viewpoint towards awards, and stated \"Now (after Padma Bhushan) I feel I don't have the right to hurt my viewers by rejecting an award.\" A few years later, on 9 June 2008, he was awarded the 2007 National Film Award for Best Actor for \"Podokkhep\" (Footsteps) (2006), which he accepted though stating \"after decades of acting, I do not attach too much value to it\".\nIn 2010, he won Best Supporting Actor at 54th Asia-Pacific Film Festival for his role in Angshumaner Chhobi (2009).\n\nIn 2012, he was awarded the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, India's highest award in cinema given annually by the Government of India for lifetime contribution to Indian cinema. In 2014, he received the introductory Filmfare Awards East for Best Male Actor (Critics) for his role in \"Rupkatha Noy\". & also he won Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award – South (1994)\nActor Soumitra Chatterjee, 82, will be honoured with France's highest civilian award, Legion of Honor. The award will be presented to the Kolkata-based actor by the Ambassador of France to India Alexandre Ziegler. Talking about the honour, Chatterjee said, “At this age, awards do not hold a great attraction. But I should say this award is slightly special as it comes from a country that is known for its cultural richness and artistic excellence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He grew up on his family's sheep farm in Menindee, New South Wales and was nicknamed \"Professor\" (hence \"Pro\") during his younger days, when he was known as an inventor.\n\nHis pictures are typically painted with oil or acrylic, using paint brushes and sponges, and depict scenes of rural town life, topical commentary, and some religious subjects. His illustrations for the collection of Henry Lawson's poems show keen powers of character observation combined with an obvious wit. Hart was also a sculptor, working with welded steel, bronze and ceramics.\n\nPro Hart was known for his novel techniques including \"cannon painting\" and \"balloon painting\", and in 2002 was using his own DNA as a mark of authenticity in his paintings. Retrospective application of a DNA mark is available for older Pro Hart paintings. An example of the Pro Hart Cannon painting was when a commercial on television was shown for stain resistant carpet, covering the entire carpet with his unique painting style.\n\nFor most of his career Hart was dismissed by many critics as a mere showman, with his art often judged as populist and derivative, and not good enough for serious critical attention. Barry Pearce, the head curator of Australian art at the Art Gallery of NSW said that comparing Hart with the artists whose work normally hangs in the gallery was \"rather like Slim Dusty being compared to Mozart\". Hart considered his critics to be a part of the \"art mafia\" and noted that he achieved his success without any help from the arts establishment.\n\nHe frequently addressed political themes in his artwork. When asked about this subject, he stated \"If I said what I thought sometimes, I might get sued so I paint to show what is going on, to bring out the truth and make people aware\".\n\nThe painting \"Aboriginal Land Rights\" is from Pro Hart's \"masks\" period. This painting highlights his conspiracy ideas with regards to land rights. The scene has a map of Australia with the Aboriginal Flag over the top. The people in the background \"playing the communist cards\" have Illuminati logos on their ties. In the foreground are a group of Aboriginal people, perhaps negotiating their rights.\n\nHe collected vintage cars and motor cycles, and invented many kinds of engines and machines. He enjoyed pistol shooting, reading the Bible, and organ music. He was the proud owner of a Rodgers electric pipe organ, which was said to be the largest of its kind in Australia. This was installed in his gallery, a step which considerably enhanced its value as a Broken Hill tourist attraction.\n\nHe was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1976. In 1982 he received an Honorary Life Membership of Society International Martinique for outstanding artistic achievement. He received an Australian Citizen of the Year award in 1983, and was known for his charitable work and generosity.\n\nPro Hart developed motor neurone disease. He died on 28 March 2006. He had been unable to paint for the last six months of his life. A large state funeral was held for him on 4 April 2006 in Broken Hill — the first state funeral in New South Wales to be held west of the Blue Mountains.\n\nHe was interred in the Broken Hill cemetery.\n\n"}

The characteristics of this stone led to the development of small open cars that carried the slate in its various forms. These were first developed on the narrow gauge railways serving the slate industry of North Wales in the late 18th century. They were initially used on horse-drawn tramways, but survived with only minor modifications into the days of locomotives and are still to be found in use in the 21st century.\n\nThe three most common types of slate wagon are:\n\nThis is the basic vehicle for transporting roofing slates from the quarry to the destination. Because roofing slates are relatively friable, they are packed vertically into the open slate waggons to reduce the chance they will be broken on their journey. Early designs used simple wooden rails to hold the packed slates. Later these were replaced with iron or steel railed examples of a similar design.\n\nSlab waggons are designed to carry large uncut slabs of slate, often internally within quarries. The most common form is flat waggon (often referred to as a \"sled\") where the slab is laid horizontally on wooden runners and chained to the wagon. A less common form is the vertical slab waggon, where two slabs are chained to an A-frame mounted on the wagon; this form of slab wagon was most famously used on the Corris Railway though other lines such as the Ffestiniog Railway also had examples of this type.\n\nThese were used almost exclusively within slate quarries. They transported waste slate from the mills to the dumps. These were often crude vehicles that were heavily abused during service. They typically consisted of a basic flat waggon with a three-sided iron body that held the waste. The waste slate was usually tipped from the wagon onto the slate tips, usually by physically tipping the entire wagon and its contents.\n\n"}

While the Alliance commander grills each member of the crew, it appears that Reaver-spawned violence has not yet run its course.\n\n\"Serenity\" encounters a drifting spacecraft which turns out to be a short-range scow converted to a one-way settler transport to the \"Outer Planets\". Mal decides to check out the derelict in order to either help survivors or loot the dead. He sends his crew off in teams to explore the ship, while he and Zoe head to a section that he suspects holds the more valuable supplies.\n\nThey arrive in a room, followed shortly by River who points out mutilated bodies hanging from the ceiling. Mal knows what did this and orders everyone to regroup in the engine room, but en route Jayne is hit from behind by an unseen attacker, whom Jayne shoots blindly four times. Mal finds the wounded man hiding behind an air grate; they bring him back to their ship.\n\nAs Simon treats the wounded man, Mal announces that he must be the lone survivor of a Reaver attack.

Young infants and chimpanzees display some of the traits of self-awareness and agency/contingency, yet they are not considered as also having self-consciousness. At some greater level of cognition, however, a self-conscious component emerges in addition to an increased self-awareness component, and then it becomes possible to ask \"\"What am I like?\"\", and to answer with self-knowledge.\n\nSelf-knowledge is a component of the self or, more accurately, the self-concept. It is the knowledge of oneself and one's properties and the \"desire\" to seek such knowledge that guide the development of the self-concept. Self-knowledge informs us of our mental representations of ourselves, which contain attributes that we uniquely pair with ourselves, and theories on whether these attributes are stable or dynamic.\n\nThe self-concept is thought to have three primary aspects:\n\nThe affective and executive selves are also known as the \"felt\" and \"active\" selves respectively, as they refer to the emotional and behavioral components of the self-concept.\nSelf-knowledge is linked to the cognitive self in that its motives guide our search to gain greater clarity and assurance that our own self-concept is an accurate representation of our \"true self\"; for this reason the cognitive self is also referred to as the \"known self\". The cognitive self is made up of everything we know (or \"think we know\" about ourselves). This implies physiological properties such as hair color, race, and height etc.; and psychological properties like beliefs, values, and dislikes to name but a few.\n\nSelf-knowledge and its structure affect how events we experience are encoded, how they are selectively retrieved/recalled, and what conclusions we draw from how we interpret the memory. The analytical interpretation of our own memory can also be called \"meta memory\", and is an important factor of \"meta cognition\".\n\nThe connection between our memory and our self-knowledge has been recognized for many years by leading minds in both philosophy and psychology, yet the precise specification of the relation remains a point of controversy.\n\n\nSelf-theories have traditionally failed to distinguish between different source that inform self-knowledge, these are \"episodic memory\" and \"semantic memory\". Both episodic and semantic memory are facets of \"declarative memory\", which contains memory of facts. Declarative memory is the explicit counterpart to \"procedural memory\", which is implicit in that it applies to skills we have learnt; they are not \"facts\" that can be \"stated\".\n\nEpisodic memory is the autobiographical memory that individuals possess which contains events, emotions, and knowledge associated with a given context.\n\nSemantic memory does not refer to concept-based knowledge stored about a specific experience like episodic memory. Instead it includes the memory of meanings, understandings, general knowledge about the world, and factual information etc. This makes semantic knowledge independent of context and personal information. Semantic memory enables an individual to know information, including information about their selves, without having to consciously recall the experiences that taught them such knowledge.\n\nPeople are able to maintain a sense of self that is supported by semantic knowledge of personal facts in the absence of direct access to the memories that describe the episodes on which the knowledge is based.\nThis evidence for the dissociation between episodic and semantic self-knowledge has made several things clear:\n\nPeople have goals that lead them to seek, notice, and interpret information about themselves. These goals begin the quest for self-knowledge.\nThere are three primary motives that lead us in the search for self-knowledge:\n\nSelf-enhancement refers to the fact that people seem motivated to experience positive emotional states and to avoid experiencing negative emotional states. People are motivated to feel good about themselves in order to maximize their feelings of self-worth, thus enhancing their self-esteem.\nThe emphasis on \"feelings\" differs slightly from how other theories have previously defined self-enhancement needs, for example the \"Contingencies of Self-Worth Model\".\nOther theorists have taken the term to mean that people are motivated to think about themselves in highly favorable terms, rather than feel they are \"good\".\nIn many situations and cultures, feelings of self-worth are promoted by thinking of oneself as highly capable or \"better\" than one's peers. However, in some situations and cultures, feelings of self-worth are promoted by thinking of oneself as \"average\" or even \"worse\" than others. In both cases, thoughts about the self still serve to enhance feelings of self-worth.\nThe universal need is not a need to think about oneself in any specific way, rather a need to maximize one's feelings of self-worth. This is the meaning of the self enhancement motive with respect to self-knowledge.\n\nIn Western societies, feelings of self-worth \"are\" in fact promoted by thinking of oneself in favorable terms.\n\nSee \"Self-verification theory\" section.\n\nAccuracy needs influence the way in which people search for self-knowledge. People frequently wish to know the truth about themselves without regard as to whether they learn something positive or negative.\nThere are three considerations which underlie this need:\nAccurate self-knowledge can also be instrumental in maximizing feelings of self-worth. Success is one of the number of things that make people feel good about themselves, and knowing what we are like can make successes more likely, so self-knowledge can again be adaptive. This is because self-enhancement needs can be met by knowing that one \"can not\" do something particularly well, thus protecting the person from pursuing a dead-end dream that is likely to end in failure.\n\nMany theorists believe that we have a motive to protect the self-concept (and thus our self-knowledge) from change. This motive to have consistency leads people to look for and welcome information that is consistent with what they believe to be true about themselves; likewise, they will avoid and reject information which presents inconsistencies with their beliefs. This phenomenon is also known as self-verification theory.\nNot everyone has been shown to pursue a self-consistency motive; but it has played an important role in various other influential theories, such as cognitive dissonance theory.\n\nThis theory was put forward by William Swann of the University of Texas at Austin in 1983 to put a name to the aforementioned phenomena. The theory states that once a person develops an idea about what they are like, they will strive to verify the accompanying self-views.\nTwo considerations are thought to drive the search for self-verifying feedback:\nThese factors of self-verification theory create controversy when persons suffering from low-self-esteem are taken into consideration. People who hold negative self-views about themselves \"selectively seek negative feedback\" in order to verify their self-views. This is in stark contrast to self-enhancement motives that suggest people are driven by the desire to feel good about themselves.\n\nThere are three sources of information available to an individual through which to search for knowledge about the self:\n\nThe physical world is generally a highly visible, and quite easily measurable source of information about one's self. Information one may be able to obtain from the physical world may include:\n\n\nThe comparative nature of self-views means that people rely heavily on the social world when seeking information about their selves. Two particular processes are important:\n\nPeople compare attributes with others and draw inferences about what they themselves are like. However, the conclusions a person ultimately draws depend on whom in particular they compare themselves with. The need for accurate self-knowledge was originally thought to guide the social comparison process, and researchers assumed that comparing with others who are similar to us in the \"important\" ways is more informative.\n\nPeople are also known to compare themselves with people who are slightly better off than they themselves are (known as an \"upward comparison\"); and with people who are slightly worse off or disadvantaged (known as a \"downward comparison\").\nThere is also substantial evidence that the need for \"accurate\" self-knowledge is neither the only, nor most important factor that guides the social comparison process, the need to feel good about ourselves affects the social comparison process.\n\nReflected appraisals occur when a person observes how others respond to them. The process was first explained by the sociologist Charles H. Cooley in 1902 as part of his discussion of the \"\"looking-glass self\"\", which describes how we see ourselves reflected in other peoples' eyes. He argued that a person's feelings towards themselves are socially determined via a three-step process:\n\n\"A self-idea of this sort seems to have three principled elements: the imagination of our appearance to the other person; the imagination of his judgment of that appearance; and some sort of self-feeling, such as pride or mortification. The comparison with a looking-glass hardly suggests the second element, the imagined judgment which is quite essential. The thing that moves us to pride or shame is not the mere mechanical reflection of ourselves, but an imputed sentiment, the imagined effect of this reflection upon another's mind.\" (Cooley, 1902, p. 153)\n\nIn simplified terms, Cooley's three stages are:\nNote that this model is of a phenomenological nature.\n\nIn 1963, John W. Kinch adapted Cooley's model to explain how a person's \"thoughts\" about themselves develop rather than their \"feelings\".\n\nKinch's three stages were:\nThis model is also of a phenomenological approach.\n\nResearch has only revealed limited support for the models and various arguments raise their heads:\n\nThe sequence of reflected appraisals may accurately characterize patterns in early childhood due to the large amount of feedback infants receive from their parents, yet it appears to be less relevant later in life. This is because people are not passive, as the model assumes. People \"actively\" and \"selectively\" process information from the social world. Once a person's ideas about themselves take shape, these also influence the manner in which new information is gathered and interpreted, and thus the cycle continues.\n\nThe psychological world describes our \"inner world\". There are three processes that influence how people acquire knowledge about themselves:\n\nIntrospection involves looking inwards and directly consulting our attitudes, feelings and thoughts for meaning.\nConsulting one's own thoughts and feelings can sometimes result in meaningful self-knowledge. The accuracy of introspection, however, has been called into question since the 1970s. Generally, introspection relies on people's explanatory theories of the self and their world, the accuracy of which is not necessarily related to the form of self-knowledge that they are attempting to assess. \n\nComparing sources of introspection. People believe that spontaneous forms of thought provide more meaningful self-insight than more deliberate forms of thinking. Morewedge, Giblin, and Norton (2014) found that the more spontaneous a kind of thought, the more spontaneous a particular thought, and the more spontaneous thought a particular thought was perceived to be, the more insight into the self it was attributed. In addition, the more meaning the thought was attributed, the more the particular thought influenced their judgment and decision making. People asked to let their mind wander until they randomly thought of a person to whom they were attracted to, for example, reported that the person they identified provided them with more self-insight than people asked to simply think of a person to whom they were attracted to. Moreover, the greater self-insight attributed to the person identified by the (former) random thought process than by the latter deliberate thought process led those people in the random condition to report feeling more attracted to the person they identified.\n\nWhether introspection always fosters self-insight is not entirely clear. Thinking too much about why we feel the way we do about something can sometimes confuse us and undermine true self-knowledge. Participants in an introspection condition are less accurate when predicting their own future behavior than controls and are less satisfied with their choices and decisions. In addition, it is important to notice that introspection allows the exploration of the conscious mind only, and does not take into account the unconscious motives and processes, as found and formulated by Freud. \n\nWilson's work is based on the assumption that people are not always aware of \"why\" they feel the way they do. Bem's self-perception theory makes a similar assumption.\nThe theory is concerned with how people \"explain\" their behavior. It argues that people don't always \"know\" why they do what they do. When this occurs, they infer the causes of their behavior by analyzing their behavior in the context in which it occurred. Outside observers of the behavior would reach a similar conclusion as the individual performing it. The individuals then draw logical conclusions about why they behaved as they did.\n\n\"Individuals come to \"know\" their own attitudes, emotions, and other internal states partially by inferring them from observations of their own overt behavior and/or the circumstances in which this behavior occurs. Thus, to the extent that internal cues are weak, ambiguous, or uninterpretable, the individual is functionally in the same position as an outside observer, an observer who must necessarily rely upon those same external cues to infer the individual's inner states.\" (Bem, 1972, p.2)\n\nThe theory has been applied to a wide range of phenomena. Under particular conditions, people have been shown to infer their attitudes, emotions, and motives, in the same manner described by the theory.\n\nSimilar to introspection, but with an important difference: with introspection we \"directly examine\" our attitudes, feelings and motives. With self-perception processes we \"indirectly infer\" our attitudes, feelings, and motives by \"analyzing our behavior\".\n\nCausal attributions are an important source of self-knowledge, especially when people make attributions for positive and negative events. The key elements in self-perception theory are explanations people give for their actions, these explanations are known as causal attributions.\n\nCausal attributions provide answers to \"Why?\" questions by attributing a person's behavior (including our own) to a cause.\n\nPeople also gain self-knowledge by making attributions for \"other people's\" behavior; for example \"If nobody wants to spend time with me it must be because I'm boring\".\n\nIndividuals think of themselves in many different ways, yet only some of these ideas are active at any one given time. The idea that is specifically active at a given time is known as the Current Self-Representation. Other theorists have referred to the same thing in several different ways:\nThe current self-representation influences information processing, emotion, and behavior and is influenced by both \"personal\" and \"situational\" factors.\n\nSelf-concept, or how people \"usually\" think of themselves is the most important personal factor that influences current self-representation. This is especially true for attributes that are important and self-defining.\n\nSelf-concept is also known as the self-schema, made of innumerable smaller self-schemas that are \"chronically accessible\".\n\nSelf-esteem affects the way people feel about themselves. People with high self-esteem are more likely to be thinking of themselves in positive terms at a given time than people suffering low self-esteem.\n\nMood state influences the accessibility of positive and negative self-views.\n\nWhen we are happy we tend to think more about our positive qualities and attributes, whereas when we are sad our negative qualities and attributes become more accessible.\n\nThis link is particularly strong for people suffering low self-esteem.\n\nPeople can deliberately activate particular self-views. We select appropriate images of ourselves depending on what role we wish to play in a given situation.\n\nOne particular goal that influences activation of self-views is the desire to feel good.\n\nHow a person thinks of themselves depends largely on the social role they are playing. Social roles influence our personal identities.\n\nPeople tend to think of themselves in ways that distinguish them from their social surroundings.\nDistinctiveness also influences the salience of group identities.\n\nThe size of the group affects the salience of group-identities. Minority groups are more distinctive, so group identity should be more salient among minority group members than majority group members.\n\nGroup status interacts with group size to affect the salience of social identities.\n\nThe social environment has an influence on the way people evaluate themselves as a result of social-comparison processes.\n\nPeople regard themselves as at the opposite end of the spectrum of a given trait to the people in their company. However, this effect has come under criticism as to whether it is a primary effect, as it seems to share space with the assimilation effect, which states that people evaluate themselves more positively when they are in the company of others who are exemplary on some dimension.\n\nImagining how one appears to others has an effect on how one thinks about oneself.\n\nRecent events can cue particular views of the self, either as a direct result of failure, or via mood.\nMemory for prior events influence how people think about themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It simulates an open-sided safari ride through the savanna of East Africa.\n\nThe current story is a short photo safari aboard a safari vehicle through the Harambe Wildlife Reserve in Harambe, East Africa. It is of natural terrain, including Ituri forest, wetlands of the Safi River valley, and the open bush country of the Serengeti Savanna. African animals on view include real live elephants, giraffes, antelopes, springboks, crocodiles, mandrills, hippopotamuses, lions, cheetahs, hyenas, african wild dogs, warthogs, ostriches, rhinoceroses, ducks, storks, pelicans, flamingos, wildebeests, okapis and zebras. The game driver points out animals and provides entertainment. The zebras were removed four months after their arrival due to \"acclimation\" issues. Some reports claim that the zebras were fighting each other, biting at vehicles or each other, standing in the road, or just causing trouble. They were quickly replaced with addax.\n\nLong before the safari or even Walt Disney World opened, Walt Disney wanted to use real African animals for the river attraction Jungle Cruise at Disneyland. However, for several reasons, Audio-Animatronics replicas were placed instead.\n\nThe ride originally included a scripted portion where the safari truck - callsign \"Simba-1\" - would be contacted by a habitat warden and a scientist to hunt down poachers that had captured a mother elephant and her child - Big Red and Little Red, respectively. The poachers would have been captured at gunpoint by another cast member, a warden. This element of the attraction was eventually eliminated and replaced with scaring off the poachers after a pursuit.\n\nDuring Cast Previews of Disney's Animal Kingdom, there was a \"Dark Ending\" in which the safari vehicle encountered the slaughtered corpse of Big Red. She was seen bloody and on the ground with her tusks sawed off, symbolizing the poachers got to her and the tour group was too late to save the mother elephant. Even though it was only an animatronic, this scene proved too shocking for families and children. Many complaints were filed, so before the official grand opening of the ride, Disney removed the dead corpse, thus changing the attraction that of a happier ending.\n\nKilimanjaro Safaris typically operates until sundown. However, during the holiday season of 1998, the safaris were continued at night and dubbed Kilimanjaro Night Safaris. Though many animals were asleep, or unable to be seen at night, the attraction had a completely different script and storyline. This \"new\" attraction featured additional animal sounds, reflectors hidden in the foliage to resemble animals' eyes, and an actual African dance troupe, who performed around a bonfire in the area normally occupied by the attraction's elephants. Kilimanjaro Night Safaris only ran during that initial holiday season. After this time, it was deemed that the additional costs, plus the fact that animal visibility was poor (eliciting many guest complaints), made Night Safaris unfeasible to continue regularly.\n\nIn 2004, much of the savanna's drainage system had to be replaced. The attraction remained open during the rehab, with green tarps covering the construction sites to keep the animals out.\n\nIn 2007–9, the trucks were extended with an extra row of seating, allowing for more capacity. Also, the safari script/story, along with the Wilson/Jobson story has significantly changed. There is less of a story about \"Little Red\", and more about the animals in the reserve and the need to find a lost elephant at the end. This led to a somewhat confused plot in which guests are searching for a lost \"mother elephant\" and eventually find her baby which, according to the story, had already been safe the whole time.\n\nIn July 2010 it was announced that guests will soon be able to go on \"guided treks\" around the savanna. This will include areas that are not part of the regular ride experience.\n\nOn February 10, 2012 it was announced that the \"Little Red\" portion of the ride would be replaced with a zebra exhibit. It opened in the fall of 2012.\n\nIn 2016, Night Safaris were reintroduced as a part of the expansion of Disney's Animal Kingdom. The nighttime changes included a \"sunset,\" animal sounds, and the introduction of hyenas to the reserve. The ride path was shortened for the night safaris in order to avoid areas where no animals would be visible.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The company developed an ultra-thin client called the \"nivo\" (network in, video out) based on Ubuntu Linux and other open-source software, for use especially in developing countries. The data sent to the clients over the network was pixel data, using a similar approach to Virtual Network Computing (VNC). \n\nThe project worked on the basis of multiple workstations running from a single PC. Quentin Stafford-Fraser, founder of the organisation, told The Economist \"We can make computing more affordable by sharing it\". The system allows a basic PC running linux to be shared by many users.\n\nThe Ndiyo Nivo was similar in concept to Sun Microsystems' Sun Ray virtual display thin client, but at sub-$100 and using only 2W, it was lower-cost and used much less power, making it more suitable for these kinds of situations.\n\nIn addition to its use by organisations within the United Kingdom, Ndiyo-based systems were deployed in internet cafes in Bangladesh and South Africa, and in Tanzanian Schools.\n\nThe Nivo technology went on to become the basis of DisplayLink, a company founded by members of the team.\n\n"}

The company merged with Peter Walker & Son in 1921 to form Walker Cains. Peter Walker & Son had a large brewery in Warrington so sold its Liverpool brewery to Higsons in 1923. Boddingtons of Manchester took over in 1985. In 1990 Whitbread acquired Boddington's brewing operations and closed the then Higsons Brewery in 1990. It was reopened by GB Breweries, who became part of Bryggerigruppen in 1991, and in 2002 was sold to Gardener-Shaw for £3.4 million.\n\nThe brewery closed in June 2013 with debts totalling more than £8m.\n\nThe Cains brewery was founded by Irishman Robert Cain in 1858 when he bought an established brewery. Cain had begun his brewing career aged 24 when he purchased a pub and brewed his own ales.\n\nWithin 25 years of founding his brewery, Cain had established 200 pubs, including the Philharmonic Dining Rooms, the Vines and the Central Commercial Hotel, which are currently listed as being of architectural merit. His personal mansion had each window arch inscribed with his monogram. In 1887 construction began on a second brewery.\n\nIn 1921, 14 years after Cain's death, the Cains brewery merged with Walkers of Warrington, becoming Walker Cains. Then in 1923 the original Stanhope Street Brewery was sold to Higsons, who continued to brew Cains ales.\n\nIn 1985, Higsons was bought by Boddingtons of Manchester. Five years later Boddingtons opted to concentrate on pub ownership and sold all its breweries to Whitbread, at which point the Stanhope Street site was closed.\n\nThe Stanhope site with its modern canning lines had been heavily invested in under Boddingtons' ownership and appeared an attractive asset. It was acquired by the previous owners of Gee Bee Soft Drinks who had sold that business to Princes. The new owners re-established the business under the Robert Cain brand but most of their production was focused on production for supermarkets.\n\nViewing Cains as a route into the UK market, Faxe Bryggeri A/S (now Royal Unibrew) then acquired the company and invested in its ales and local pubs. Unlike its larger competitor Carlsberg, Faxe failed to crack the UK market and put Cains up for sale in 2002.\n\nCains was acquired in 2002 by the Dusanj brothers making them the first Asian owners of a British brewery. At the time it had a turnover of £30 million, it took just over ten years for it to go into administration with debts, indicating a loss of £38 million - sinking over £3.5 million per year.\n\nIn June 2007, a reverse takeover of AIM-listed pub operator Honeycombe Leisure plc was agreed by the company's board, giving Cains access to Honeycombe's 109 outlets and a stock market listing. The company was renamed Cains Beer Company PLC and, like Cains Brewery, ceased to function and accrued insurmountable debts within a year.\n\nOn 7 August 2008 the company was placed in administration due to unpaid tax and other debts amounting to £38 million, despite its annual turnover of £65.5 million. Negotiations with its bank failed to reach a conclusion that would have avoided administration.\nThe brewery and eight original pubs were bought back by the Dusanj brothers for £103,750. As the Dusanji family holds the freehold to the Brewery site and controls the terms of any lease for brewery operation, no other buyer could be found.\n\nIn April 2013, Cains announced it would be ending contract brewing and production of supermarket beers. A month later, it said it would cease brewing altogether and find a contract brewer for its beers. 38 staff were made redundant. In the same month, Liverpool CAMRA reported that Cains was down to an estate of three pubs – the Brewery Tap, Dr Duncan's and The Dispensary. However, a 2015 news articles state that Cains still has an estate of five pubs. The additional two pubs are thought to be the two out-of-town pubs Kelly's Dispensary in Smithdown Road and The Edinburgh in Wavertree.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Cains announced a redevelopment of the site for leisure and housing with a small craft brewery proposed to continue the Cains ales.\n\nIn January 2014, Cains was reported to have arranged for small quantities of its beers to be contract-brewed for export and sale in its small pub estate. The contract brewery was not cited.\n\nIn August 2013, co-owner Sudarghara Dusanj said that he hoped Cains would have its own microbrewery up and running in time for the start of the International Festival of Business in June 2014. However, the microbrewery had yet to launch as of Spring 2016.\n\nOver two years later in October 2015, Sudarghara Dusanj was again talking up the prospects of a Cains craft brewery to the Liverpool Echo with 2016 the implied date. He told the paper “The timing depends on getting the other parts of the listed building lined up with other users, including a hotel, restaurants and a market. If that can all come together, we don’t see any reason why it can’t open by 2017.”\n\nHowever, a Cains craft brewery would face competition from a new Higsons Brewery which looks to set up a very similar attraction around the corner.\n\nLiverpool City Council granted planning permission for what was to become known as the Cains Brewery Village in November 2013. This was described as a tourism, leisure and retail attraction. The million square foot site will include a 94-bedroom hotel, cinema, bistro bar, restaurants and an open-plan retail hall for artisan food producers.\n\nIn March 2014 the UK Government decided not to not hold a public enquiry into the redevelopment, possibility due to its large scale.\n\nJune 2014 saw potential tenant Baltic Yards Ltd's plans unveiled for a Sunday market in Brewery Village. Baltic Yards was described as being an urban bazaar. However, the company failed to get off the ground and was dissolved in November 2015.\nA food hall was opened on the site in June 2017. Open four times a week and operated by Baltic Markets, the venue offers food, drink, entertainment and live events.\n\nPlans were announced in July 2018 for a £7 million refurbishment of the brewery building. The plans include restarting brewing of beer on the site as well as the creation of two bars, a food market and music venue.\n\n\n"}

His parents were Francis Marion Wheeler and Jeanie Melissa Shaw. He had five siblings including sister Margaret Jean Wheeler Schuddakopf and brother George Shaw Wheeler. He was a graduate of Reed College. He was a brilliant scholar who upon graduation received a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University, and there, spurred by what he learned through his studies in economics, he joined the university branch of the Communist Party. He did post-graduate work at the University of Paris but dropped out to join the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War. There he met Mary Lukes Vause, a fellow graduate of Reed College, a new mother and the widow of his best friend, Clare Vause. They were married in 1938. He later returned to Oxford (1968) and completed his doctoral studies. Duncan Chaplin Lee, an Oxford classmate, described him as a really \"progressive person\".\n\nWheeler was associated with various so-called \"Comintern\" organizations before being employed by the New Deal federal government, first in the United States Department of Agriculture, later the Department of Treasury. From 1941 to 1946, Wheeler was employed by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in Washington, D.C.\n\nWheeler was allegedly a member of the white collar unit of the Communist Party of the District of Columbia. Franz Neumann, who worked with him in the OSS, allegedly gave a good report to Moscow, describing him as \"a calm and progressive man\".\n\nIn November 1943, Earl Browder, Chairman of the CPUSA, turned control of the Perlo group of Soviet spies over to Jacob Golos two months before Golos's death, and the group was subsequently taken over by his girlfriend, Elizabeth Bentley.\n\nPerlo later wrote to his Soviet supervisors of Wheeler: He has access to excellent material and once given an explanation of what was wanted, worked hard and bravely to get it... He has not been reckless but has gotten materials regularly under security conditions more difficult than those faced by most others in the group. According to Allen Weinstein, \"Beginning in 1944, virtually the entire range of OSS analytic and planning documents on Nazi Germany and its postwar prospects flowed continuously from General Donovan's Washington headquarters through Wheeler to Pavel Fitin's offices in Moscow.\" \n\nAs a member of the OSS Research and Analysis Division, Wheeler had government security clearance to received secret and confidential \"ditto\" copies of monthly and semi-monthly reports of political developments throughout the world. Wheeler is alleged to have passed these reports as well as handwritten and typewritten material of cable reports from the State Department and the OSS to Soviet intelligence. Wheeler is alleged to have provided information on the organization and policies of British intelligence services and furnished memoranda prepared by the Foreign Nationalities Branch of OSS on material relating to the particular racial groups and activities within the United States. These allegations, launched during McCarthyism resulted in no charges ever being brought against Wheeler, who contended that the charges of espionage were a response to his outspoken criticism of the failings of the American economic and political system.\n\nBeginning in 1944, the entire range of OSS planning documents on the postwar occupation of Germany are alleged to have been supplied to KGB head Pavel Fitin through Wheeler. Some observers considered Wheeler the most active operative within the Perlo group, and his complicity was alleged to have been corroborated by information exhumed from the NKVD archives in the 1990s. Wheeler allegedly appears in Venona as a Soviet source under the cover name \"Izra\".\n\nWheeler continued to pass documents to the Soviet Union after the war. In November 1945 he sent information on various issues. This included a report on the Italian domestic political situation on the eve of elections in that country; a copy of the confidential report written by the military governor in the U.S. occupation zone of the USSR; OSS reports about current political events in the USSR; OSS weekly reports on political events in Europe and a State Department intelligence report on the Middle East.\n\nIn the 1950s, Wheeler became a dairy farmer in Washington state because he was unable to find teaching work. Wheeler was subpoenaed as a hostile witness before federal grand juries in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco; his pregnant wife and four children milk the cows. He was also summoned three times before the House Un-American Activities Committee. His sister, Margaret Jean Schuddakopf, said that his courage and steadfastness was her beacon as she fought her own battle for the right to teach.\n\nHe had a long and distinguished teaching career, despite constant harassment and \"blacklisting\". He taught at Yale University, at Franconia College in Franconia, New Hampshire, and at Brandon University in Manitoba, Canada.\n\nIn 1938, Wheeler married Mary Lukes Vause, a fellow graduate of Reed College, a new mother, and the widow of his best friend, Clare Vause.\n\nDonald Niven Wheeler died age 89 on November 8, 2002, in Seattle, Washington.\n\nWheeler's papers are in the archives of the University of Washington, and his library will be donated to the George A. Meyers Collection at Frostburg State University in Maryland.\n\n\n"}

Funke was a leading figure in Czech photography during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nFunke was born in Skuteč to a wealthy family of a Bohemian-German lawyer father and a Czech mother. He studied medicine, law, and philosophy at the Charles University in Prague and the University of Bratislava but did not graduate and instead turned to photography.\n\nFunke was recognized for his play of “photographic games” with mirrors, lights, and insignificant objects, such as plates, bottles, or glasses, to create unique works. His still life's created abstract forms and played with shadows looking similar to photograms. His work was thought to be logical, original and expressive in nature. A typical feature of Funke's work would be the “dynamic diagonal.\" \n\nDuring his photography profession, Funke published editorials and critiques about photography. By 1922, Funke had become a skilled freelance photographer and two years later he, Josef Sudek and Adolf Schneeberger created the Czech Photographic Society. From 1931-1935, Funke headed the photography department at the School of Arts and Crafts in Bratislava. Soon after, Funke taught at the School of Graphic Art in Prague until 1944. Alongside Ladislav Sutha, the director of the previous school, Funke published \"Fotografie vidí povrch\" in 1935. While travelling, Funke became interested in politically engaged photography. \"Bad living\" was created during the time period of 1930-1931 and was a photographic series that dealt with the issues of poverty. Funke later became an editor of the journal \"Fotografický obzor\" (\"Photographic Horizons\") for several years. He published a number of works including \"Od fotogrameuk emoci\" which is understood to be his manifesto.\n\nAs travelling was limited during World War II in 1939, Funke photographed close to home in Louny, Prague and sometimes Kolín. On March 22, 1945 in Kolin, Funke required an immediate operation for intestine damage but the procedure could not be executed as it was during an air raid alarm and he died.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1941942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941942", "title": "All American (musical)", "text": "All American (musical)\n\nAll American is a musical with a book by Mel Brooks, lyrics by Lee Adams, and music by Charles Strouse. Based on the Robert Lewis Taylor 1950 novel \"Professor Fodorski\", it is set on the campus of the fictional Southern Baptist Institute of Technology: the worlds of science and sports collide when the principles of engineering are applied to football strategies, and football strategies are used to teach the principles of engineering. The techniques of a Hungarian immigrant, Professor Fodorski, prove to be successful, resulting in a winning team, and he finds himself the target of a Madison Avenue ad man who wants to exploit his new-found fame.\n\nThe Broadway production, in 1962, starred Ray Bolger. It drew mostly unfavorable reviews and ran for 80 performances, though the song \"Once Upon a Time\" became popular.\n\nAdams and Strouse, following the success of \"Bye Bye Birdie\" (1960), and Brooks, then a relatively unknown television comedy writer with no experience writing for the stage, created an old-fashioned musical reminiscent of such lighthearted fare as \"Good News\". The show was beset with problems from the start. Brooks never completed the second act, leaving the task to Joshua Logan, a noted script doctor whose comedic sensibilities were incompatible with those of Brooks, and the difference in writing styles was obvious. Additionally, Logan's emerging bipolar disorder was beginning to affect his work. Once Ray Bolger agreed to play Fodorski, the script was tailored to showcase his talents, but turning the musical into a star vehicle for a performer who was no longer an audience favorite ultimately proved to be a mistake.\n\nTheatre writer Ken Mandelbaum noted that Brooks used his experience working on the show as a basis for his 1968 movie \"The Producers\", in which an out-of-luck producer intentionally mounts a musical flop.\n\nAct 1\n\nA group of immigrants arrives via plane in New York (\"Melt Us\"). Among them is Professor Stanislaus Fodorski, who has accepted a position as Professor of Engineering at a small college. Taking a bus to the campus, he marvels at the panorama passing by (\"What a Country!\"). He is greeted by the school's dean, Elizabeth Hawkes-Bullock. Surprised that the dean is a woman, he is even more surprised to learn he will be boarding in a room in her house. An accomplished author, he confesses doubt about his teaching skills, and she admits the school may not be strong academically, but needs more teachers who think of their students as \"Our Children\". Two of those students are confined to their respective dorm rooms after Doctor Snoops, Professor of Comparative Religion, catches Ed Bricker climbing the ivy to visit Susan Thompson's room (\"Animal Attraction\").\n\nFodorski's first engineering class does not go over well with any of the students except Ed, who has always been interested in bridges (\"We Speak the Same Language\"). The professor's fears about his teaching skills vanish when he watches his first football game, which he sees as an example of applied engineering (\"I Can Teach Them!\"). He starts incorporating football strategy into his lessons, and soon all his students are engaged and learning (\"It's Fun to Think\"). The admiration between the Dean and the Professor grows, and one evening they reminisce about past romances (\"Once Upon a Time\"). Less happy is Susan, still confined to her dorm room and unable to join in the \"Nightlife\" fun on campus, but her mood changes when Ed appears on her balcony trellis. After a short visit, he climbs down the ivy, ecstatic about their growing affection for each other (\"I've Just Seen Her\"), and is almost caught again by Dr. Snoops, but Dean Hawkes-Booth's sudden arrival allows Ed to slip away unnoticed.\n\nFodorski visits the gym to give a pep talk to Ed and the rest of the football team (\"Physical Fitness\"). The team's spirits are high on the day of the game against the school's rivals (\"The Fight Song\"), but their performance on the field is terrible. Coach \"Hulk\" Stockworth is knocked out by a charging player from the other side, and the only one who can take over is Fodorski. Following his advice to think of his legs as a giant lever, Ed kicks a 98-yard field goal, winning the game.\n\nAct 2\n\nProfessor Fodorski's sudden rise to fame has been noticed by Henderson, the owner of an advertising company called Exploiters Unlimited. Henderson plots to exploit the professor, make lots of money, then get him deported. Back on campus, the big hero at the Homecoming Ball is Ed \"Bricker-the-Kicker\", who accepts an award for his game-winning kick, claiming that \"I Couldn't Have Done It Alone.\" Outside the ball, Fodorski proposes to the Dean, who happily accepts (\"If I Were You\"). Suddenly, Henderson appears with a different kind of proposal, to form a Fodorski Foundation, and after a little persuasion, the professor agrees (\"Have a Dream\").\n\nThe football team has been winning game after game, and they are soon heading for the Cotton Bowl. As their successes continue, Fodorski's name is being used to endorse hundreds of products, and his face is on the cover of many magazines (\"I'm Fascinating\"). Ed Bricker's ego has also grown with each win, and he has given up interest in engineering in favor of professional football.\n\nEd has also lost interest in Susan, who pleads for help from the Dean. Feeling ignored by Fodorski, the Dean shows up in Ed's dormitory with martinis and dressed seductively, planning to get him disqualified from the football team (\"The Real Me\"). Dr. Snoops arrives with the school president, who fires the Dean. Hearing the news, Fodorski is shocked, and realizes he needs to make things right (\"Which Way?\"). He benches Ed so the school will lose the Cotton Bowl, thwarting Ed's hopes for a football career, and ruining Henderson as the Fodorski Foundation collapses. The two pairs of lovers reconcile, and with the dream of a football championship gone, the students go back to their studies, and Fodorski receives a letter granting his application for citizenship (\"Finale\").\n\n\nThe Broadway production, directed by Logan and choreographed by Danny Daniels, opened on March 19, 1962, at the Winter Garden Theatre, where it ran for 80 performances. In addition to Bolger, the cast included Ron Husmann, Anita Gillette (Susan), Fritz Weaver, and Eileen Herlie. Bolger had not appeared on the stage in a decade, during which his appeal with audiences had declined. He tried to start a sing-along to \"What a Country!\" (which worked during \"Once in Love with Amy\" in the 1948 musical \"Where's Charley?\", his biggest Broadway success), but audiences failed to join in.\n\nReviews were mixed, though mostly unfavorable. Howard Taubman wrote in \"The New York Times\" that the main problem with the show \"is that it's not sure whether it means to be sentimental, satirical or simply rowdy, and it ends by being dreary.\" Walter Kerr in the \"Herald Tribune\" said, \"Mr. Bolger is never fascinating until he stands right up and tells you he is,\" and went on to praise Bolger's dance technique in the number \"I'm Fascinating\".\n\nLogan and Bolger were each nominated for 1962 Tony Awards.\n\nAn original cast album was released by Columbia Masterworks Records. The songs \"Animal Attraction\", \"I Can Teach Them!\", \"I've Just Seen Him\", and several reprises were not included. A CD re-issue was released by Sony Broadway in 1992 and contains a 42-page booklet of liner notes, including a plot synopsis.\n\nIn 1962, Duke Ellington and his Orchestra released \"All American in Jazz\" featuring big band arrangements of the show's tunes.\n\nIn 2006, Harbinger Records released a CD entitled \"All American Live Backers Audition\", a recording of a session for potential financial investors featuring Adams and Strouse performing their score, including songs cut prior to opening night, with Adams providing a running commentary between the numbers.\n\n\n"}

He represented the riding of Winnipeg North from 1962 to 1988 as a member of the New Democratic Party.\n\nOrlikow was the son of Louis Orlikow and Sarah Cherniack. He first cousin was Saul Cherniack, also a prominent Manitoba politician and a cabinet minister in the provincial government of Edward Schreyer.\n\nHe was educated at the University of Manitoba, and worked as a labour educator and pharmacist. Orlikow married Velma (Val) Kane on June 1, 1946. They had one daughter, Leslie.\n\nHis mother, Sarah, was first elected to the Winnipeg School Board as the school trustee for Ward 3 in 1925. Orlikow's cousin, Mindel Cherniak Sheps, succeeded her in the seat when she retired, and held it until 1950 when her brother, Saul Cherniak, was elected.\n\nOrlikow's brother, Lionel, was also a trustee on the Winnipeg school board from 1988 to 1998. When Lionel Orlikow retired, he was succeeded by his son John, now a Winnipeg City Councillor.\n\nHe served as a trustee on the Winnipeg School Board from 1945 to 1951, and was an alderman in the city of Winnipeg from 1951 to 1959. He also served on the board of directors for Winnipeg's John Howard & Elizabeth Fry Society from 1958 to 1961, and was a board member of the Welfare Council of Greater Winnipeg in 1958.\n\nOrlikow was also involved with the Jewish Labour Society and the Canadian Labour Congress. He helped to organize a steelworkers' union in the northern Manitoba town of Thompson, after INCO set up operations in the area. Other organizations of which Orlikow was involved included the Union Centre and the Manitoba Society of Seniors.\n\nOrlikow was a founding member of the NDP and a lifetime member of the CCF/NDP. In 1961, Orlikow took part in Manitoba CCF's transition to the New Democratic Party.\n\nIn the provincial election of 1958, Orlikow was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation in the north-end Winnipeg constituency of St. John's. He defeated his Progressive Conservative and Liberal-Progressive opponents by a significant margin. He was re-elected in the 1959 election, by the reduced margin of 251 votes over Progressive Conservative opponent Dan Zaharia. David Orlikow was an NDP MLA from June 16, 1958 to May 1962.\n\nOrlikow maintained an interest in the Manitoba NDP after switching to federal politics. In 1968-69, he helped facilitate the party's transition of leadership from Russell Paulley to Edward Schreyer.\n\nThe Manitoba Legislature paid tribute to Orlikow on Thursday June 25, 1998.\n\nJudy Wasylycia-Leis, whose riding, both as an MLA and an MP included much of the area earlier represented by Orlikow, recalled the advice and information she used to receive from Orlikow and his many phone calls. Wasylycia-Leis's provincial counterparts NDP MLAs Dave Chomiak and Doug Martindale also admitted to being among those on the receiving end of those phone calls.\n\nAccording to Doug Martindale, Orlikow \"never really retired\" from politics in that Orlikow was always researching various issues and providing the information he gathered to various Manitoba NDP MLAs and MPs. Orlikow was a frequent visiter to the Manitoba Legislature's library and, even when hospitalized, he managed to transform his hospital room into a mini office. During the last week of his life, Orlikow was researching the financial impact of smoking on the health care system, and what types of lawsuits he figured the Federal and Provincial governments should launch against the tobacco industry to recover some of the cost.\n\nOrlikow resigned his legislative seat in May 1962 to run for the Canadian House of Commons. He was elected in Winnipeg North in the federal election of 1962, defeating Liberal Paul Parashin by just under 4,000 votes. He defeated Parashin again by a narrower margin in the 1963 election, but increased his majority to nearly 10,000 votes in the election of 1965.\n\nHe came close to losing his seat in the \"Trudeaumania\" election of 1968, defeating Liberal Cecil Semchyshyn by only 963 votes. After this, he was returned by safe majorities in the elections of 1972 and 1974, 1979, 1980 and 1984.\n\nThere was a provincial swing against the NDP in the federal election of 1988, and Orlikow unexpectedly lost the Winnipeg North riding to Liberal Rey Pagtakhan by fewer than 2,000 votes. After a 26-year career in the Commons, Orlikow was genuinely surprised by the result. Orlikow was an NDP MP from June 18, 1962 to November 21, 1988.\n\nThroughout his career, Orlikow fought for progressive policies in fields such as immigration, refugees, social justice and labour. During the 1980s, he sought reforms to Canada's Bank Act which would have required banks to invest a portion of their money in local development projects. In the very last week of his life, he was researching ways for the federal and provincial governments to recover monies from tobacco companies for the social costs of cigarette use.\n\nAfter his death in January 1998, former staffer Dan O'Connor wrote the following eulogy:\n\n\"David was always on the side of the ordinary person.

A small tropical cyclone, Yunya rapidly developed from a tropical disturbance near East Samar on June 11. By June 13 the storm had reached typhoon status as it moved west-northwest near the Philippines. Yunya attained its peak intensity the following day with estimated winds of ; however, strong wind shear soon impacted the typhoon and caused it to rapidly decay. The storm struck southern Luzon early on June 15 as a minimal typhoon before moving over the South China Sea later that day. After turning north and weakening to a tropical depression, the system brushed the southern tip of Taiwan on June 16 before dissipating the following day.\n\nAcross the Philippines, Yunya produced heavy rains that triggered significant flooding. Hundreds of homes and several bridges were washed away by swollen rivers. Six people were killed as a direct result of the storm, 2,013 homes were destroyed, and 24 others were damaged. Although the storm itself caused significant damage, the worst effects were related to the system's heavy rains mixing with volcanic ash from Mount Pinatubo, creating massive lahars that killed 320 people.\n\nOn June 11, 1991, a tropical disturbance developed east of East Samar. Situated to the southwest of a tropical upper tropospheric trough, the system experienced little wind shear and gradually intensified as it moved northwestward. The following day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the system as a tropical depression. At 15:00 UTC on June 12, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JWTC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the depression. Around this time, the storm began a period rapid development and a tiny central dense overcast formed. At 18:15 UTC, the \"USNS Spica\" sailed directly through the storm, measuring a barometric pressure of 989.5 mbar (hPa; 29.22 inHg) and peak winds of . Although Yunya was already a tropical storm, the JTWC did not issue their first advisory on the system until early on June 13, at which time they assigned it the name Yunya.\n\nBased on the measurements provided by the \"USNS Spica\", the storm was analyzed as a midget cyclone with a gale diameter of . Initially, the storm tracked northwestward at . Throughout June 13, subsidence around the periphery of Yunya allowed the system to develop good outflow. As a result, the storm attained typhoon status later that day before strengthening slowed. By June 14, Yunya turned towards the west-northwest in response to a subtropical ridge to the north. Following this turn, the typhoon attained its peak intensity as a Category 3-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson scale with winds estimated at . Around the same time, the JMA assessed Yunya to have been slightly weaker, with peak winds estimated at along with a pressure of 950 mbar (hPa; 28.05 inHg).\nWithin hours of reaching its peak strength on June 14, strong wind shear associated with a second subtropical ridge over Asia impacted the typhoon. Due to the system's small size, the shear was able to disrupt the cyclone's core and cause rapid weakening as it approached southern Luzon. Around 00:00 UTC on June 15, Yunya made landfall just north of Dingalan Bay as a minimal typhoon and weakened to a tropical storm shortly thereafter. As the storm moved across Luzon, Mount Pinatubo, a volcano in the Zambales Mountains on the island's western side, was experiencing a major eruption—the second-largest to occur during the 20th century. Due to Yunya's circulation, the massive cloud of ash produced by the eruption was moistened and redistributed over the Philippines instead of blowing out to sea, greatly exacerbating the impact of the event.\n\nLater on June 15, Yunya emerged into the South China Sea as a minimal tropical storm. Persistent wind shear prevented the system from strengthening and the storm ultimately degraded into a tropical depression by June 16. Having turned north within a break in the subtropical ridge, Yunya brushed the southern tip of Taiwan late on June 16 before dissipating the following day within the westerlies.\n\nOn June 14, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration raised storm warnings in advance of Typhoon Yunya for much of Luzon and areas south of Manila. With Mount Pinatubo having already erupted once by this time, there were fears that the storm's heavy rains, combined with ash from the volcano, would create massive lahars capable of burying towns away from Pinatubo. As a result, 60,000 individuals were evacuated. Landslides on June 14 destroyed bridges in Santa Fe and homes in nearby Castillejos were washed away. By June 15, air-borne ash combined with the typhoon's rainfall, resulting in widespread travel disruptions and structural collapses. The mixture also made it appear as through it was nighttime during the middle of the day, prompting concern from residents. The wind from the typhoon carried ash within from Pinatubo, including to Manila, which prompted most of the airports in the country to close and Philippine Airlines to cancel all domestic and international flights through June 19. Low to mid-level winds and heavy rains from the storm contributed to widespread tephra falling over an area of of central and western Luzon. Heavy rains also resulted in lahars along mountains between the Gumain River to the Sacobia River and between Sacobia River to the O'Donnell River. These lahars inundated crops and homes, especially along the Abacan River. As a result of the lahars, some buildings and all bridges in Angeles were destroyed. Moreover, 320 people were killed and 279 others were injured. The United States Geological Survey believes that the death toll from the lahars would have been far lower if not for Yunya. \n\nIn addition to the lahars, widespread flooding also took place in Luzon as rivers overtopped their banks. Elsewhere, a person was killed by debris in Manila. Across Olongapo City, power was knocked out, and one person was killed after the roof of a bus terminal collapsed under the weight of ash and rain. Two people died and three others were injured in an accident near Clark Air Base, where power was also knocked out. Along the Sacobia River in Pampanga, at least 170 homes were washed away due to the storm. The Abacan bridge spanning the Abacan River collapsed with a truck carrying three people, and an empty car. It is unknown whether the three people survived. A total of 2 people were killed and at least 12 warranted evacuation in Angeles when the roof of a bus terminal, where 100 people were riding out the storm, operated by Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines collapsed. Civil defense officials confirmed that five other bridges collapsed in Pampanga and Zambales provinces. All crops were destroyed throughout Iriga. Overall, 2,013 homes were destroyed and 24 others were damaged during the passage of the typhoon. A total of 2,035 families or 10,185 people were evacuated to shelters. Excluding from lahars, six people were killed by Yuyna.\n\n"}

Chopin wrote the piece before he had finished his formal education, at around 20 years of age. It was first performed on 17 March 1830, in Warsaw, Poland, with the composer as soloist. It was the second of his piano concertos to be published (after the Piano Concerto No. 1), and so was designated as \"No. 2\", even though it was written first.\n\nThe work contains the three movements typical of instrumental concertos of the period:\n\nMaestoso (F minor)\n\nLarghetto (A-flat major)\n\nA work of \"undescribable beauty\", this nocturnal movement was inspired by Chopin's distant idolization of Konstancja Gładkowska. The main theme (the \"A\" section) is introduced by the piano after an orchestral introduction and is later repeated twice and again, at measure 82 (the start of the coda), is enhanced by the sublime entrance of the bassoon in canon, followed by the bassoon transitioning to a counter-melody.\n\nAllegro vivace (F minor - F major)\n\nThe virtuosic finale is in sonata form. The violins and violas are at one point instructed to play col legno (with the wood of the bow). For the piano, the final sections are regarded as extremely technically demanding.\n\nChopin's fellow composers and Prof. Elsner's former students, Ignacy Feliks Dobrzyński (1807-1867) and Tomasz Nidecki (1807-1852), are believed to have helped him orchestrate his piano concertos. This gave an excuse for other musicians to make slight alterations in the score. Alfred Cortot created his own orchestration of the F minor concerto and recorded it with the London Philharmonic Orchestra under John Barbirolli in 1935. Ingolf Wunder recorded Alfred Cortot's orchestration with minor changes done by himself in 2015. More recently (in 2017), Mikhail Pletnev recorded his arrangements of both of Chopin's piano concertos, conducting the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, with pianist Daniil Trifonov.\n\n"}

Funding for the scheme comes from the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office and its partner organisations\n\nThe Chevening Scholarships Programme commenced in 1983 as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Awards Scheme (FCOAS) and is funded by the British government's Foreign and Commonwealth Office and its partner organisations. The stated objective of the scheme is to build a network of friends of the UK, who will be future leaders in their countries. In 1994, the name of the scheme was changed to Chevening, after Chevening House in Sevenoaks, Kentcurrently the joint official residence of the British Foreign Secretary and the British Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nA companion Chevening Fellowships Scheme was launched by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 2004. The Fellowships programme provides places for mid-career professionals already in positions of leadership and influence to undertake 3-month courses in fields related to the FCO's policy goals.\n\nIn 2007/08 year the Chevening Scholarships cost the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office approximately £22 million. In the same year the Chevening Fellowships scheme cost approximately £4 million. In July 2010 the British Foreign Minister announced a cut of £10 million from the scholarships budget, in the context of wider budget cuts. This resulted in a number of scholarships being cancelled for 2010–11. After a review period, the 2011–12 scholarship round opened for applications in February 2011. In 2011–12 the number of scholarships was increased to more than 700 worldwide. In 2015/16 the number of scholarships was increased to 1,500. In 2017/18, the total number of scholarships was 1,650. \n\nIn April 2012, the Association of Commonwealth Universities took over running of the scheme from the British Council, establishing a Chevening Secretariat.\n\nIn October 2018, the Chevening Scholarships Programme celebrated its 35th anniversary by awarding a total number of 1,800 scholarships from 160 countries for the 2018/19 school year. Earlier that year, the number of Chevening alumni also hit the 50,000 mark. \n\nThe number of available scholarships varies from country to country. More than thirty scholarships are currently awarded to candidates from Nepal, India, Russia and China. Twenty or more are awarded to candidates from Egypt, South Korea, Indonesia, Pakistan, Mexico, Thailand and Brazil, with less than five core scholarships now available to candidates from Australia and Canada (US students are not eligible, but can apply for the Marshall Scholarships which are also funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office). The Chevening Scholarship is not available to non-indigenous Australian candidates.\n\nThe significance of the Chevening scholarship scheme rests on its large scopein 2017/18 1650 scholarships were awarded to students from more than 140 countries, allowing students from developing countries to access British tertiary education institutions, some of which are of a very high standard as determined by international rankings. In this way the Chevening scheme is more similar to the US Fulbright Scholarships which bring students from 140 countries to the US and differs from the Rhodes Scholarship scheme which currently allows applications from approximately 18 countries. Winners of Chevening scholarships often receive coverage in national and local newspapers.\n\nThe selection criteria for Chevening Scholarship are aimed to identify \"high-calibre graduates with the personal, intellectual and interpersonal qualities necessary for leadership.\" Specific selection criteria for Chevening Scholarships varies from country to country, and from year to year. In 2017/18, of 65, 000 applicants, 1650 scholarships were awarded.\n\nApplications are made online via a web portal between early August and early November of each year, except for some sponsored scholarships for which applicants apply via the co-sponsoring organisation. Applications for 2018/19 opened on 6 August 2018 and will close on 6 November 2018 at 5pm BST. Scholarship applicants must also apply directly to their preferred universities in the UK, usually for taught master's degree courses. Most scholarships include a living stipend, airfares and the full or partial cost of tuition fees.\n\nThe most popular destinations for study in 2011 were the London School of Economics & Political Science, University College London, and the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, University of Nottingham, University of Bath and King's College London.\n\nAs of 2017/18, there are an estimated 50,000 Chevening Scholarship alumni, with an emphasis being placed on improved links with and between previous scholars as a consequence of reviews in 2005 and 2006.

{"id": "1941972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941972", "title": "Interleukin 12", "text": "Interleukin 12\n\nInterleukin 12 (IL-12) is an interleukin that is naturally produced by dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and human B-lymphoblastoid cells (NC-37) in response to antigenic stimulation. IL-12 belongs to the family of interleukin-12. IL-12 family is unique in comprising the only heterodimeric cytokines, which includes IL-12, IL-23, IL-27 and IL-35. Despite sharing many structural features and molecular partners, they mediate surprisingly diverse functional effects.\n\nIL-12 is composed of a bundle of four alpha helices. It is a heterodimeric cytokine encoded by two separate genes, IL-12A (p35) and IL-12B (p40). The active heterodimer (referred to as 'p70'), and a homodimer of p40 are formed following protein synthesis.\n\nIL-12 is involved in the differentiation of naive T cells into Th1 cells. It is known as a T cell-stimulating factor, which can stimulate the growth and function of T cells. It stimulates the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) from T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, and reduces IL-4 mediated suppression of IFN-γ. T cells that produce IL-12 have a coreceptor, CD30, which is associated with IL-12 activity.\n\nIL-12 plays an important role in the activities of natural killer cells and T lymphocytes. IL-12 mediates enhancement of the cytotoxic activity of NK cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. There also seems to be a link between IL-2 and the signal transduction of IL-12 in NK cells. IL-2 stimulates the expression of two IL-12 receptors, IL-12R-β1 and IL-12R-β2, maintaining the expression of a critical protein involved in IL-12 signaling in NK cells. Enhanced functional response is demonstrated by IFN-γ production and killing of target cells.\n\nIL-12 also has anti-angiogenic activity, which means it can block the formation of new blood vessels. It does this by increasing production of interferon gamma, which in turn increases the production of a chemokine called inducible protein-10 (IP-10 or CXCL10). IP-10 then mediates this anti-angiogenic effect. Because of its ability to induce immune responses and its anti-angiogenic activity, there has been an interest in testing IL-12 as a possible anti-cancer drug. However, it has not been shown to have substantial activity in the tumors tested to this date. There is a link that may be useful in treatment between IL-12 and the diseases psoriasis & inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nIL-12 binds to the IL-12 receptor, which is a heterodimeric receptor formed by IL-12Rβ1 and IL-12Rβ2. IL-12Rβ2 is considered to play a key role in IL-12 function, since it is found on activated T cells and is stimulated by cytokines that promote Th1 cells development and inhibited by those that promote Th2 cells development. Upon binding, IL-12R-β2 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and provides binding sites for kinases, Tyk2 and Jak2. These are important in activating critical transcription factor proteins such as STAT4 that are implicated in IL-12 signaling in T cells and NK cells. This pathway is known as the JAK-STAT pathway.\n\nAn extensive review and visualization of IL-12 signaling can be found at the peer-reviewed pathway database Reactome: Interleukin-12 family\n\nIL-12 is linked with autoimmunity. Administration of IL-12 to people suffering from autoimmune diseases was shown to worsen the autoimmune phenomena. This is believed to be due to its key role in induction of Th1 immune responses. In contrast, IL-12 gene knock-out in mice or a treatment of mice with IL-12 specific antibodies ameliorated the disease.\n\nResults published in the \"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology\" from a study where mice that were bred to be allergic to peanuts, interleukin-12 has been shown to not be present, suggesting that the molecule normally stops allergies to food developing. Further investigation is underway, to determine whether the results found in mice are as profound in humans.\n\nInterleukin 12 (IL-12) is produced by activated antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells, macrophages). It promotes the development of Th1 responses and is a powerful inducer of IFNγ production by T and NK cells.\n\nA child with Bacillus Calmette–Guérin and \"Salmonella enteritidis\" infection was found to have a large homozygous deletion within the IL-12 p40 subunit gene, precluding expression of functional IL-12 p70 cytokine by activated dendritic cells and phagocytes. As a result, IFNγ production by the child's lymphocytes was markedly impaired.\nThis suggested that IL-12 is essential for protective immunity to intracellular bacteria such as mycobacteria and Salmonella.\n\nSupport is lent to this idea by the observation that a receptor for IL-12 is important for IFNγ production by lymphocytes. T and NK cells from seven unrelated patients who had severe idiopathic mycobacterial and Salmonella infections failed to produce IFNγ when stimulated with IL-12. The patients were otherwise healthy. They were found to have mutations in the IL-12 receptor β1 chain, resulting in premature stop codons in the extracellular domain, resulting in unresponsiveness to this cytokine, again demonstrating IL-12's crucial role in host defense.\n\nDefective Th1 and Th17 immune responses leading to chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis result from a mutation further downstream in the IL-12 signalling pathway. The trait was mapped to mutations in the STAT1 gene, which were associated with lower production of interferon-γ, IL-17, and IL-22 in response to IL-12 or IL-23 receptor associated Jak2 and Tyk2 activity.\n\n"}

She was named for Secretary of the Navy David Henshaw.\n\nBuilt by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation of Squantum, Massachusetts, \"Henshaw\" was launched 28 June 1919, with Miss Ethel H. Dempsey as sponsor. She commissioned at Boston, Massachusetts on 10 December 1919, Lieutenant Commander Martin J. Peterson in command.\n\nThe new destroyer sailed to Newport, Rhode Island, for torpedoes and ammunition and from there left for the Caribbean, arriving at Guantanamo 9 February 1920. From 24 February until 4 March \"Henshaw\" was part of the Navy fleet standing off Port Cortes, Honduras, to protect American lives and interests in case of a revolution taking place in Guatemala. Once it was clear that a revolution was not going to occur, she sailed for the West Coast, joining the destroyer squadron, Pacific Fleet, at San Diego, California on 1 April. Her first duty was to escort the Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII, in into and out of San Diego on 7–8 April.\n\nAfter exercises with the fleet off the California coast, \"Henshaw\" sailed to Seattle, Washington, where on 10 July she joined the cruise of Josephus Daniels, Secretary of the Navy, Admiral Hugh Rodman, Commander of the Pacific Fleet, and John B. Payne, Secretary of the Interior. While inspecting Alaskan coal and oil fields, and looking for possible fleet anchorages, the cruise touched at nine northern ports, including Ketchikan, Sitka, Dundas Bay, and Juneau, before \"Henshaw\" returned to San Diego on 17 August. During the cruise she had been visited by all the dignitaries involved, and had transported Thomas Briggs, Governor of the territory of Alaska, and his party, from Sitka to Juneau.

The USC Fencing Club is one of many U.S. collegiate level fencing programs.\n\nThe beginnings of the USC Fencing Team date back before its creation in 1926 to the initiation of Rufus B. von KleinSmid as the fifth President of the University of Southern California in 1921. Von KleinSmid was, among his many talents, a skilled fencer and an enthusiastic promoter of the sport. He received instruction on a regular basis at the Los Angeles Athletic Club (L.A.A.C.), an institution which is still in existence in its original location downtown. The fencing instructor at the Athletic Club was Belgian fencing master Henry J. Uyttenhove. Shortly after von KleinSmid took office, fencing was first offered as a \"Sophomore Sport,\" essentially a recreational sport separate from the varsity athletics of the university. None other than Henry Uyttenhove became the first fencing instructor at USC.\n\nIn 1926, a few years into the fencing program, the team grew out of its sophomore sports standing as \"the department was reorganized by Coach Uyttenhove, and with the material at hand he put out an honest to goodness fencing team.\" After only being in existence for one year, the USC Fencing Team placed second in the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate matches of the American Fencers League of America (the precursor to the USFA), held in San Francisco. \n\nWith a flood of interest in fencing by the students of USC, women's fencing was first offered as an intramural sport in 1927 under the tutelage of Uyttenhove, and already in 1928, several of the women were placing in the finals of the Pacific Coast Championship Tournament. \n\nThe USC Fencing Team went on to become a powerhouse in Pacific Coast Intercollegiate tournaments, winning countless titles in several weapons as Uyttenhove continued to instruct his students. For example, by 1940, after fifteen years of fencing at USC, the fencing team had collected 14 Pacific Coast Intercollegiate titles.\n\nWhen von KleinSmid began training with Uyttenhove at the Los Angeles Athletic Club, he was not the only VIP to learn from the maestro. In 1920, actor Douglas Fairbanks was engaged to star in the movie \"The Mark of Zorro\". Fairbanks employed Uyttenhove to instruct him on the fencing arts and to train him for his movies, and soon he began taking lessons at the Athletic Club. There, he met von KleinSmid and the two became very good friends. They were often seen dueling each other, and it is fair to say these earliest connections between USC and Hollywood were made on a fencing strip. \n\nDouglas Fairbanks would go on to become the first president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. According to the Academy, \"The College Affaire Committee was one of the first committees established by the Academy. It met for the first time just 13 days after the Academy's organization banquet in 1927 and that meeting's purpose was to confer with USC President Rufus von KleinSmid about the possibility of introducing appropriate motion picture courses into the university curriculum. The result of that and future meetings, as well as the friendship that existed between von KleinSmid and the Academy's first president, Douglas Fairbanks, was 'Introduction to Photoplay.' First offered in the spring of 1929, this lecture series course featured speakers that included Fairbanks, directors D.W. Griffith and Ernst Lubitsch, MGM Production Chief Irving Thalberg and Producer William deMille.\" Out of the friendship between the two swordsmen, the world-renowned USC School of Cinema-Television was born in 1929.\n\nWith the resurgence of interest in recreational sports and the construction of the USC Lyon Center, the fencing team received a new base and more ability to recruit new members. Now, in the 21st century, the fencing team remains as committed to teaching new fencers the skills they need to compete at a high level as the team was in 1926 when it all began. This latest reincarnation of the fencing team, with Dr. Scott Frank, Derek Cotton and Terry Dix as coaches, has produced champion fencers in the collegiate league. \n\nEach spring, the USC Fencing Club hosts the annual USFA-sanctioned USC Linkmeyer Invitational, in memory of Fred Linkmeyer (class of '31).\n\n\n"}

Romary attended the University of Southern California from 1946–1949, where she fenced at the University of Southern California Fencing Club.\n\nShe competed in women's individual foil at the 1948 London Olympics, the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, the 1960 Rome Olympics, the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and the 1968 Mexico City Olympics — the first woman to compete in six Olympics, a feat matched four years later by Romanian discus thrower Lia Manoliu and finally surpassed in 1988 by fellow fencer, Sweden's Kerstin Palm. In recognition of her extraordinary streak of Olympic appearances, Romary was honored at the Mexico City Olympics in 1968 by being the first woman to carry the flag for the United States.\n\nThough she never medaled at the Olympics, she was a finalist in women's individual foil in 1952 and 1956, finishing fourth both times: in 1952, she tied for third place, but lost to Denmark's Karen Lachmann on touches.\n\nIn addition to her Olympic success, Romary won the U.S. foil championship in 1950, 1951,1956, 1957, 1960, 1961, 1964, 1966, 1967, and 1968, missing the 1959 championships due to pregnancy. Her 10 U.S. championships is more than any other male or female fencer. She won the 1967 World Wide Sportsman's Award, and in August 1968, became the only fencer to ever win the Helms Foundation Athlete of the Month Award. She also won a silver and a bronze medal at the Pan American Games in 1963, and a gold in 1967.\n\nRomary's husband, Charles Romary, was also an épée and sabre fencer, sports that did not exist at the Olympic level for women until the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. He took up the sport after marrying Janice in 1953.\n\nRomary's association with the Olympics and the sport of fencing continued well beyond her Olympic competition. She was women's administrator for the United States Olympic Committee for the 1976 Montreal Olympics and was responsible for all U.S. women competitors. At the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, she was commissioner of fencing.\n\nRomary was inducted into the United States Fencing Association Hall of Fame in the 1970s. After retiring from fencing, she moved to Klamath Falls, Oregon with her husband, where they ran a water purification business. She died in Klamath Falls on May 31, 2007 of complications from Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\nOlympic record at Sports-Reference.Com\n"}

It is the fictional last testament of Otto Dietrich zur Linde, the one-legged commandant of a Nazi concentration camp. After being tried and convicted of crimes against humanity, Zur Linde reflects on his own sins and those of Nazi Germany while he awaits the firing squad.\n\nA member of the German nobility, zur Linde is born in Marienburg, West Prussia in 1908. Raised Lutheran, zur Linde loses his faith in Christianity after reading the writings of Schopenhauer, Nietzsche and Oswald Spengler. Soon after, he joins the Schutzstaffel. Despite his deep contempt for his fellow SS men, zur Linde persuades himself that the Nazi Party needs men like himself to assure the world a glorious future.\n\nOn March 1, 1939, he is wounded in the leg while attacking a synagogue in Tilsit. Days later, when the Wehrmacht invades Czechoslovakia, zur Linde is recuperating in a hospital following the amputation of his leg. Declaring how Raskolnikov's switch to robbery and murder was more difficult than the conquests of Napoleon Bonaparte, zur Linde relates how, on February 7, 1941, he was appointed subdirector of Tarnowitz concentration camp. There, many Jewish intellectuals are tortured and murdered under his orders.\n\nHe relates, \"Carrying out the duties attendant on that position was not something I enjoyed, but I never sinned by omission. The coward proves himself among swords, the compassionate man, seeks to be tested by jails and other's pain.\"\n\nDuring the fall of 1942, Otto's brother Friedrich is killed in action in the Second Battle of El Alamein. Soon after, an Allied bombing raid destroys zur Linde's house in Marienburg.\n\nSoon after the end of the Second World War, zur Linde is captured and placed on trial for crimes against humanity. Refusing to offer a defense for his actions, zur Linde is convicted and sentenced to death by firing squad. As he awaits his end, zur Linde scribbles a last testament in his prison cell. He offers no justification and rejoices in the fact that \"violence and faith in the sword\" shall govern the future rather than \"servile Christian acts of timidity.\" He further expresses hope that, if victory and glory do not belong to Nazi Germany, they may belong to other nations: \"Let heaven exist, though our place be in hell.\"\n\nAs he ponders how he shall comport himself before the firing squad, zur Linde realizes that he feels no fear or pity, even for himself.\n\nZur Linde's reflections articulate a typical trait of fascism, the notion of sacrificial violence and rejection of the sentiment of empathy for his victim, his dehumanization and blaming. This passage refers to Nietzsche's \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" (1885), in which the disposition of sharing in the suffering of the victim is seen as a vulnerability.\n\nIn an interview with Richard Burgin, Borges recalled how his interactions with Argentina's Nazi sympathisers led him to write the short story. And then I realized that those people that were on the side of Germany, that they never thought of German victories or the German glory. What they really liked was the idea of the Blitzkrieg, of London being on fire, of the country being destroyed. As to the German fighters, they took no stock in them. Then I thought, well now Germany has lost, now America has saved us from this nightmare, but since nobody can doubt on which side I stood, I'll see what can be done from a literary point of view in favor of the Nazis. And then I created the ideal Nazi. Of course, no Nazi was ever like that, they were all full of self pity; when they were on trial no one thought of saying, \"Yes, I'm guilty, I ought to be shot; why not, this is as it should be and I would shoot you if I could.\" Nobody said that. They were all apologising and crying...\n\n<br>\n"}

In a simulator, the movement is synchronised with a visual display of the outside world (OTW) scene. Motion platforms can provide movement in all of the six degrees of freedom (DOF) that can be experienced by an object that is free to move, such as an aircraft or spacecraft:. These are the three rotational degrees of freedom (roll, pitch, yaw) and three translational or linear degrees of freedom (surge, heave, sway).\n\nMotion simulators can be classified according to whether the occupant is controlling the vehicle(such as in a Flight Simulator for training pilots), or whether the occupant is a passive rider, such as in a simulator ride or motion theater.\n\nMotion platforms for aircraft simulators are at the high end, plus some of the more expensive amusement park rides that use a simulator-type motion base; arcade amusement devices are in the middle, and motion platforms for home use are low-cost but not as capable of the higher-level devices.\n\nMany motion platforms are used in flight simulators used to train pilots.\n\nOne of the first motion platforms, the Sanders Teacher, was created in 1910. This was a model aircraft connected to the ground by a universal joint. When wind was present, the pilot in training was able to use the aircraft's control surfaces to move the model in the three rotational degrees of freedom pitch, roll and yaw.\n\nIn 1929 a significant advance in motion platform technology was made with the patent by Edwin Link for what became known as the \"Link Trainer\". This used the pilot's control stick and rudder controls to control organ-type bellows under the simulator cockpit. The bellows could inflate or deflate, giving movement in pitch, roll, and yaw.\n\nIn 1958 a flight simulator for the Comet 4 aircraft used a three-degrees-of-freedom hydraulic system. \nSimulator motion platforms today use 6 jacks (\"Hexapods\") giving all six degrees-of-freedom, the three rotations pitch, roll and yaw, plus the three translational movements heave (up and down), sway (sideways) and surge (longitudinal).\n\n6 Dof motions are powerful cues when combined with outside-world (OTW) imagery. Motion platforms together with OTW imagery are used in : flight simulation, driving simulation, amusement rides, and small home-based simulators.\n\nThe motion platform is used in military and commercial flight instruction training applications. Also in entertainment devices in theme parks, with users from single people to many, seated in rows in front of screens in which pictures are projected, synchronised with motions from the platform under the simulator cab.\nA typical high-end motion system is the Stewart platform, which provides full 6 degrees of freedom (3 translation and 3 rotation) and employs sophisticated algorithms to provide high-fidelity motions and accelerations. These are used in a number of applications, including flight simulators for training pilots.\n\nThe middle of the spectrum includes motion platforms in arcade amusement games, rides, and other arrangements. These systems fall into a price range from $10,000 to US$99,000. Typically the space requirements for such a platform are modest requiring only a portion of an arcade room and a smaller range of motion is provided via similar, less expensive, control systems than the high-end platforms.\n\nThe lower-cost systems include home-based motion platforms, which have recently become a more common device used to enhance video games, simulation, and virtual reality. These systems fall into a price range from $1,000 to US$9,000. Within the 2000s (decade), several individuals and business entities have developed these smaller, more affordable motion systems. Most of these systems were developed mainly by flight simulation enthusiasts, were sold as do it yourself projects, and could be assembled in the home from common components for around one thousand US dollars ($1,000). Recently, there has been increased market interest in motion platforms for more personal, in-home, use. The application of these motion systems extends beyond just flight training simulation into a larger market of more generalized \"craft-oriented\" simulation, entertainment, and virtual reality systems.\n\nMotion platforms are commonly used in the field of engineering for analysis and verification of vehicle performance and design. The ability to link a computer-based dynamic model of a particular system to physical motion gives the user the ability to feel how the vehicle would respond to control inputs without the need to construct expensive prototypes. For example, an engineer designing an external fuel tank for an aircraft could have a pilot determine the effect on flying qualities or a mechanical engineer could feel the effects of a new brake system without building any hardware, saving time and money.\n\nFlight simulators are also used by aircraft manufacturers to test new hardware. By connecting a simulated cockpit with visual screen to a real flight control system in a laboratory, integrating the pilot with the electrical, mechanical, and hydraulic components that exist on the real aircraft, a complete system evaluation can be conducted prior to initial flight testing. This type of testing allows the simulation of \"seeded faults\" (i.e. an intentional hydraulic leak, software error, or computer shutdown) which serve to validate that an aircraft's redundant design features work as intended. A test pilot can also help identify system deficiencies such as inadequate or missing warning indicators, or even unintended control stick motion. This testing is necessary to simulate extremely high risk events that cannot be conducted in flight but nonetheless must be demonstrated. While 6 degree-of-freedom motion is not necessary for this type of testing, the visual screen allows the pilot to \"fly\" the aircraft while the faults are simultaneously triggered.\n\nMotion simulators are sometimes used in theme parks to give the park guests a themed simulation of flight or other motion.\n\nSome examples:\n\nSome driving and flying simulation games allow the use of specialized controllers such as steering wheels, foot pedals or joysticks. Certain game controllers designed in recent years have employed haptic technology to provide realtime, tactile feedback to the user in the form of vibration from the controller. A motion simulator takes the next step by providing the player full-body tactile feedback. Motion gaming chairs can roll to the left and right and pitch forward and backward to simulate turning corners, accelerations and decelerations. Motion platforms permit a more stimulative and potentially realistic gaming experience, and allow for even greater physical correlation to sight and sound in game play.\n\nThe way we perceive our body and our surroundings is a function of the way our brain interprets signals from our various sensory systems, such as sight, sound, balance and touch. Special sensory pick-up units (or sensory \"pads\") called receptors translate stimuli into sensory signals. External receptors (exteroceptors) respond to stimuli that arise outside the body, such as the light that stimulates the eyes, sound pressure that stimulates the ear, pressure and temperature that stimulates the skin and chemical substances that stimulate the nose and mouth. Internal receptors (enteroceptors) respond to stimuli that arise from within blood vessels.\n\nPostural stability is maintained through the vestibular reflexes acting on the neck and limbs. These reflexes, which are key to successful motion synchronization, are under the control of three classes of sensory input:\n\nProprioceptors are receptors located in muscles, tendons, joints and gut, which send signals to the brain in proportion to accelerations to which the body is subject. An example of a \"popular\" proprioceptor mentioned by aircraft pilots, is the feeling in the \"seat of the pants\". Proprioceptors respond to stimuli generated by muscle movement and muscle tension. Signals generated by exteroceptors and proprioceptors are carried by sensory neurons or nerves and are called electrochemical signals. When a neuron receives such a signal, it sends it on to an adjacent neuron through a bridge called a synapse. A synapse \"sparks\" the impulse between neurons through electrical and chemical means. These sensory signals are processed by the brain in response to signals that travel along motor nerves. Motor neurons, with their special fibres, carry these signals to muscles, which are instructed to either contract or relax.\n\nThese are all sensors of acceleration, and do not respond when a constant speed or velocity is reached. At constant speed, visual cues give cues of motion until another acceleration takes place and the body's motion sensors once more send signals to the brain.\n\nIn simulator motion platforms, after an initial acceleration is produced, the platform is re-set to a neutral position at a rate below human motion threshold so that the subject does not detect the so-called \"wash out\" phase of simulator motion cueing. The motion system is then ready to make the next acceleration which will be detected by the subject, as in the real world. This so-called \"acceleration onset cueing\" is an important aspect in simulators with motion platforms and models the way humans feel motions in the real world.\n\nThe vestibular system is the balance and equilibrium system of the body that includes the left and right vestibular organs of the \"inner ear\". It consists of three semicircular canals, or tubes, arranged at right angles to one another. Each canal is lined with hairs connected to nerve endings and is partially filled with fluid. When the head experiences acceleration the fluid moves within the canals, causing the hair follicles to move from their initial orientation. In turn the nerve endings signal to the brain, which interprets them as acceleration in the three rotations pitch, roll, or yaw.\n\nThe vestibular system generates reflexes to maintain perceptual and postural stability, compared to the other senses of vision, touch and sound, the vestibular input is registered quickly by the brain, whereas visual changes such as perspective and horizon movement, follow shortly after. Therefore, in a simulator it is essential that visual cues are not perceived before motion cues, the reverse of the real-world situation, or so-called \"simulator sickness\" can occur. Second, if the head experiences sustained accelerations on the order of 10 – 20 seconds, the hair follicles return to the “zero” or vertical position and the brain interprets this as the acceleration ceasing. Additionally, there is a lower acceleration threshold of about 2 degrees per second that the brain cannot perceive. In other words, slow motion below the threshold will not generate vestibular cues. As discussed in the preceding “Proprioceptors” section, this allows simulator motion to be \"washed out\" below threshold, ready for the next acceleration to be produced by the motion platform and sensed by the subject of the simulator.\n\nThe human eye is an important source of information in motion simulation where a high resolution picture is available such as by day in good visibility. The eye relays information to the brain about the craft's position, velocity, and attitude relative to the ground. As a result, it is essential for realistic simulation that cues from a motion platform (if fitted) works in synchronization to the external visual scene. As discussed above, in the real world motion cues are processed by the brain before visual changes, and this must be followed in a simulator or dizziness and even nausea can occur in some people, so called \"simulator sickness\".\n\nFor example, if the occupant commands the vehicle to roll to the left, the visual displays must also roll by the same magnitude and at the same rate. Simultaneously, the cab tilts the occupant to imitate the motion. The occupant's proprioceptors and vestibular system sense this motion. The motion and change in the visual inputs must align well enough such that any discrepancy is below the occupant's threshold to detect the differences in motion.\n\nIn order to be an effective training or entertainment device, the cues the brain receives by each of the body's sensory inputs must agree.\n\nIt is physically impossible to correctly simulate large scale motion in the limited space available in a simulator. The standard approach is to simulate cues of initial acceleration as closely as possible.\n\nIn principle, velocity cannot be directly perceived by relative cues alone, like those from the vestibular system. For such a system, flying in space with some constant velocity is not different from sitting in a chair. However, changing the velocity is perceived as acceleration, or force acting on the human body. For the case of constant linear acceleration, a substitute for the real situation is simple. Since the amplitude of the acceleration is not very well perceived by humans, one can tilt the subject backwards and use the gravity vector as a replacement for correct resulting force from gravity and forward acceleration. In this case, leaning a simulator backwards and rotating the visual picture by the same angle gives the subject a force on the back that is perceived as forward acceleration.\n\nLinear accelerations are detected by otoliths. The otolith structure is simpler than the three-axis semicircular canals that detect angular accelerations. The otoliths contain calcium carbonate particles that lag behind head movement, deflecting hair cells. These cells transmit motion information to the brain and oculomotor muscles. Studies indicate that the otoliths detect the tangential component of the applied forces. A transfer function model between the perceived force formula_1 and the applied forces formula_2 is given by:\n\nformula_3\n\nBased on centrifuge experiments, threshold values of 0.0011 ft/s have been reported; values up to 0.4 ft/s have been reported based on airborne studies in the USSR. The same studies suggest that the threshold is not a linear acceleration but rather a jerk motion (third time derivative of position), and the reported threshold value is on the order of 0.1 ft/s. These findings are supported by early studies showing that human movement kinematics is represented by characteristics of jerk profiles.\n\nAngular accelerations are detected by semicircular canals. The three semicircular canals are mutually orthogonal (similar to three-axis accelerometer) and are filled with a fluid called the endolymph. In each canal, there is a section where the diameter is larger than the rest of the canal. This section is called the ampulla and is sealed by a flap called the cupula. Angular accelerations are detected as follows: an angular acceleration causes the fluid in the canals to move, deflecting the cupula. The nerves in the cupula report the motion to both the brain and oculomotor muscles, stabilizing eye movements. A transfer function model between the perceived angular displacement formula_1 and the actual angular displacement formula_5 is:\n\nformula_6\n\nA second-order model of the angle of the cupula formula_7 is given by\n\nformula_8\n\nwhere formula_9 is the damping ratio, formula_10 is the natural frequency of the cupula, and formula_11 is the input angular acceleration. Values of formula_9 have been reported to be between 3.6 and 6.7 while values of formula_10 have been reported to be between 0.75 and 1.9. Thus, the system is overdamped with distinct, real roots. The shorter time constant is 0.1 seconds, while the longer time constant depends on the axis about which the test subject is accelerating (roll, pitch, or yaw). These time constants are one to two orders of magnitude greater than the shorter time constant.\n\nExperiments have shown that angular accelerations below a certain level cannot be detected by a human test subject. Values of formula_14 have been reported for pitch and roll accelerations in a flight simulator.\n\nThe above studies indicate that the pilot's vestibular system detects accelerations before the aircraft instruments displays them. This can be considered an inner control loop in which the pilots responds to accelerations that occur in full-motion simulators and aircraft, but not in fixed simulators. This effect shows that there is a potential negative training transfer when transitioning from a fixed-based simulator to an aircraft and indicates the need for motion systems for full-fidelity pilot training.\n\nIt is physically impossible to precisely simulate large scale real motion in the limited space of a laboratory. The standard approach to simulating motion (so called motion cueing) is to simulate the “relevant” cues as closely as possible which trigger motion perception. These cues can be visual, auditory, or somatosensory in nature. Visual and auditory cues enable humans to perceive their location in space on an absolute scale, whereas somatosensory cues (mainly proprioception and other signals from the vestibular system) provide only feedback of accelerations.\n\nFor example, consider riding in a car traveling at some arbitrary constant speed. In this situation, our sense of sight and sound provide the only cues (excluding engine vibration) that the car is moving; no other forces act on the passengers of the car except for gravity. Next, consider the same example of a car moving at constant speed except this time, all passengers of the car are blindfolded. If the driver were to step on the gas, the car would accelerate forward thus pressing each passenger back into their seat. In this situation, each passenger would perceive the increase in speed by sensing the additional pressure from the seat cushion.\n\nWashout filters are an important aspect of the implementation of motion platforms as they allow motion systems, with their limited range of motion, to simulate the range of vehicle dynamics being simulated. Since the human vestibular system automatically re-centers itself during steady motions, washout filters are used to suppress unnecessary low-frequency signals while returning the simulator back to a neutral position at accelerations below the threshold of human perception. For example, a pilot in a motion simulator may execute a steady, level turn for an extended period of time which would require the system stay at the associated bank angle, but a washout filter allows the system to slowly move back to an equilibrium position at a rate below the threshold which the pilot can detect. This allows the higher level dynamics of the computed vehicle to provide realistic cues for human perception, while remaining within the limitations of the simulator.\n\nThree common types of washout filters include classical, adaptive and optimal washout filters. The classical washout filter comprises linear low-pass and high-pass filters. The signal into the filter is split into translation and rotational signals. High-pass filters are used for simulating transient translational and rotational accelerations, while the low-pass filters are used to simulate sustaining accelerations. The adaptive washout filter uses the classical washout filter scheme, but utilizes a self-tuning mechanism that is not featured with the classical washout filter. Finally, the optimal washout filter takes into account models for vestibular system.\n\nThe classical washout filter is simply a combination of high-pass and low-pass filters; thus, the implementation of the filter is compatibly easy. However, the parameters of these filters have to be empirically determined. The inputs to the classical washout filter are vehicle-specific forces and angular rate. Both of the inputs are expressed in the vehicle-body-fixed frame. Since low-frequency force is dominant in driving the motion base, force is high-pass filtered, and yields the simulator translations. Much the same operation is done for angular rate.\n\nTo identify the tilt of the motion platform, the tilt mechanism first supplies the low-frequency component of force for rotation calculation. Then, the high-frequency component 'f' is used to orient the gravity vector 'g' of the simulator platform:\n\nformula_15\n\nTypically, to find position, the low-pass filter (in a continuous-time setting) is represented in the s-domain with the following transfer function:\n\nformula_16\n\nThe inputs to the high-pass filter are then calculated according to the following equation:\n\nformula_17\n\nwhere formula_18 are the force inputs. The high-pass filter may then be represented according to (for example) the following series:\n\nformula_19\n\nThe two integrators in this series represent the integration of acceleration into velocity, and velocity into position, respectively. formula_20 formula_21, and formula_22 represent the filter parameters. It is evident that the output of the filter will vanish in steady state, preserving the location of the open-loop equilibrium points. This means that while transient inputs will be \"passed\", steady-state inputs will not, thus fulfilling the requirements of the filter.\n\nThe present practice for empirically determining the parameters within the washout filter is a trial and error subjective tuning process whereby a skilled evaluation pilot flies predetermined maneuvers. After each flight the pilot's impression of the motion is communicated to a washout filter expert who then adjusts the washout filter coefficients in an attempt to satisfy the pilot. Researchers have also proposed using a tuning paradigm and the capturing of such using an expert system.\n\nThis washout filter can be regarded as the result of a combination of an Adaptive and an Optimal washout filter. A nonlinear approach is desired to further maximize the available motion cues within the hardware limitations of the motion system, therefore resulting in a more realistic experience. For example, the algorithm described by Daniel and Augusto computes a gain, α, as a function of the system states; thus, the washout is time varying. The 'α' gain will increase as the platform states increase their magnitude, making room for a faster control action to quickly washout the platform to its original position. The opposite outcome occurs when the magnitude of the platform states is small or decreasing, prolonging the motion cues which will be sustained for longer durations.\n\nLikewise, the work of Telban and Cardullo added an integrated perception model that includes both visual and vestibular sensation to optimize the human's perception of motion. This model as shown to improve pilot's responses to motion cues.\n\nThis adaptive approach was developed at NASA Langley. It is made up of a combination of empirically determined filters in which several of the coefficients are varied in a prescribed manner in order to minimize a set objective (cost) function. In a study conducted at the University of Toronto the coordinated adaptive filter provided the “most favorable pilot ratings” as compared with the other two types of washout filters. The benefits of this style of washout filter can be summarized with two major points. First, the adaptive characteristics give more realistic motion cues when the simulator is near its neutral position, and the motion is only reduced at the limits of the motions systems capabilities, allowing for better use of the motion system's capabilities. Second, the cost function or the objective function (by which the washout filter is optimized) is very flexible and various terms may be added in order to incorporate higher fidelity models. This allows for an expandable system that is capable of changing over time, resulting in a system that responds in the most accurate way throughout the simulated flight. The disadvantages are that the behavior is difficult to adjust, primarily due to the cross fed channels. Finally execution time is relatively high due to the large number of derivative function calls required. In addition as more complex cost functions are introduced the corresponding computing time required will increase.\n\nAlthough washout filters do provide great utility for allowing the simulation of a wider range of conditions than the physical capabilities of a motion platform, there are limitations to their performance and practicality in simulation applications. Washout filters take advantage of the limitations of human sensing to the appearance of a larger simulation environment than actually exists. For example, a pilot in a motion simulator may execute a steady, level turn for an extended period of time which would require the system stay at the associated bank angle. In this situation, a washout filter allows the system to slowly move back to an equilibrium position at a rate below the threshold which the pilot can detect. The benefit of this is that the motion system now has a greater range of motion available for when the pilot executes his next maneuver.\n\nSuch behavior is easily applied in the context of aircraft simulation with very predictable and gradual maneuvers (such as commercial aircraft or larger transports). However, these slow, smooth dynamics do not exist in all practical simulation environments and diminish the returns of washout filters and a motion system. Take training of fighter pilots, for example: while the steady, cruise regime of a fighter aircraft may be able to be well simulated within these limitations, in aerial combat situations flight maneuvers are executed in a very rapid manner to physical extremes. In these scenarios, there is not time for a washout filter to react to bring the motion system back to its range equilibrium resulting in the motion system quickly hitting its range of movement limitations and effectively ceasing to accurately simulate the dynamics. It is for this reason that motion and washout filter based systems are often reserved for those that experience a limited range of flight conditions.\n\nThe filters themselves may also introduce false cues, defined as: 1) a motion cue in the simulator that is in the opposite direction to that in the aircraft, 2) a motion cue in the simulator when none was expected in the aircraft, and 3) a relatively high-frequency distortion of a sustained cue in the simulator for an expected sustained cue in the aircraft. The previous definition groups together all of the cueing errors that lead to very large decreases in perceived motion fidelity. \nSix potential sources of false cues are:\n\nThe use of physical motion applied in flight simulators has been a debated and researched topic. The Engineering department at the University of Victoria conducted a series of tests in the 1980s, to quantify the perceptions of airline pilots in flight simulation and the impact of motion on the simulation environment. In the end, it was found that there was a definite positive effect on how the pilots perceived the simulation environment when motion was present and there was almost unanimous dislike for the simulation environment that lacked motion. A conclusion that could be drawn on the findings of the Response of Airline Pilots study is that the realism of the simulation is in direct relationship to the accuracy of the simulation on the pilot. When applied to video gaming and evaluated within our own gaming experiences, realism can be directly related to the enjoyment of a game by the game player. In other words, – motion enabled gaming is more realistic, thus more iterative and more stimulating. However, there are adverse effects to the use of motion in simulation that can take away from the primary purpose of using the simulator in the first place such as Motion Sickness. For instance, there have been reports of military pilots throwing off their vestibular system because of moving their heads around in the simulator similar to how they would in an actual aircraft to maintain their sensitivity to accelerations. However, due to the limits on simulator acceleration, this effect becomes detrimental when transitioning back to a real aircraft.\n\nMotion or simulator sickness: Simulators work by “tricking” the mind into believing that the inputs it is receiving from visual, vestibular and proprioceptive inputs are a specific type of desired motion. When any of the cues received by the brain do not correlate with the others, motion sickness can occur. In principle, simulator sickness is simply a form of motion sickness that can result from discrepancies between the cues from the three physical source inputs. For example, riding on a ship with no windows sends a cue that the body is accelerating and rotating in various directions from the vestibular system, but the visual system sees no motion since the room is moving in the same manner as the occupant. In this situation, many would feel motion sickness.\n\nAlong with simulator sickness, additional symptoms have been observed after exposure to motion simulation. These symptoms include feelings of warmth, pallor and sweating, depression and apathy, headache and fullness of head, drowsiness and fatigue, difficulty focusing eyes, eye strain, blurred vision, burping, difficulty concentrating, and visual flashbacks. Lingering effects of these symptoms were observed to sometimes last up to a day or two after exposure to the motion simulator.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to simulation sickness, which can be categorized into human variables, simulator usage, and equipment. Common human variable factors include susceptibility, flight hours, fitness, and medication/drugs. An individual's variance in susceptibility to motion sickness is a dominant contributing factor to simulator sickness. Increasing flight hours is also an issue for pilots as they become more accustomed to the actual motion in a vehicle. Contributing factors due to simulator usage are adaptation, distorted or complicated scene content, longer simulation length, and freeze/reset. Freeze/reset refers to the starting or ending points of a simulation, which should be as close to steady and level conditions as possible. Clearly, if a simulation is ended in the middle of an extreme maneuver then the test subjects IMU system is likely to be distorted. Simulator equipment factors that contribute to motion sickness are quality of motion system, quality of visual system, off-axis viewing, poorly aligned optics, flicker, and delay/mismatch between visual and motion systems. The delay/mismatch issue has historically been a concern in simulator technology, where time lag between pilot input and the visual and motion systems can cause confusion and generally decrease simulator performance.\n\nMotion platforms can only reproduce the sensation of actual motion in the initial acceleration. It cannot be sustained because of the physical limits of the size of the motion platform. However, the motion sensors of the human body respond to accelerations rather that sustained motion, and so a motion platform can produce motion cueing. The human motion sensors consist of the inner ear (the vestibular apparatus) with three semicircular canals for sensing rotations, and otolith organs for sensing linear accelerations. Hexapod motion platforms are used in full flight simulators, which are used for training pilots in worldwide civil aviation, under the rules of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and regional Civil Aviation Authorities such as EASA in Europe and the FAA in the USA.\n\n\n\n"}

The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.\n\nPerformance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The \"Clemson\" class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried a maximum of of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .\n\nThe ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) guns. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A \"Y-gun\" depth charge thrower was added to many ships.\n\n\"Meyer\", named for George von Lengerke Meyer, was laid down 6 February 1919 at the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Squantum, Massachusetts; launched 18 July 1919; sponsored by Mrs. C. R. P. Rodgers, daughter of Mr. Meyer; and commissioned 17 December 1919, Commander W. E. Clarke in command.\n\nAfter an east coast shakedown, \"Meyer\" departed Boston, Massachusetts 9 February 1920 for the west coast. She arrived San Diego, California 1 April only to depart soon afterward for a cruise to San Francisco, California and various Alaskan ports. Returning to San Diego 18 August, she continued to operate along the west coast, ranging from Alaska to Panama, with occasional voyages to Hawaii, for the next 8 and a half years. During that time her assignments were varied and in August, 1927, \"Meyer\" served as one of the ships used to assist pilots participating in the Dole Race from the mainland to Hawaii. Early in 1929 the destroyer began inactivation overhaul and on 15 May 1929 was decommissioned at San Diego. On 17 June she was towed to Mare Island for scrapping. Struck 25 November 1930, her materials were sold 25 February 1932.\n\nAs of 2019, no other ships have been named \"Meyer\".\n\n\"Meyer\" can be briefly seen in the movie, \"tin pan alley\", just after the two male leads enlist in the army to serve in WW1.

The AFLA changed its name to the United States Fencing Association in 1981.\n\nThe USFA was incorporated as a non-profit corporation in Pennsylvania in 1964 and in Colorado in 1993 in compliance with the Amateur Sports Act. It opened its national office at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado in August 1982. The national office moved from the Olympic Training Center to downtown Colorado Springs in 2002. The USFA's first full-time Executive Director was hired in 1983.\n\nThe USFA is affiliated with the Fédération Internationale d'Escrime (FIE), the international federation for fencing founded in Paris in 1913.\n\nThe USFA tracks ratings for its members. Ratings are a system of classification for USFA fencers; they are primarily used to seed tournaments, but are also considered to be (very) broad indicators of skill. When a fencer first joins the USFA, he or she will have a classification of \"U\", or \"Unrated.\" There are six different ratings in the USFA those being U (the lowest rating), E, D, C, B, A (the highest rating) Fencers may increase their classification—from U to E, and then up to A—by placing in USFA-sanctioned tournaments. A tournament must have a certain number of competitors, and those competitors must maintain a certain ratio of classifications, for the top fencers to be eligible for ratings.\n\nThe United States Fencing Hall of Fame (or \"U.S. Fencing Association Hall of Fame\") is a hall of fame for fencers.

The parent siloxanes include the oligomeric and polymeric hydrides with the formulae H(OSiH)OH and (OSiH). Siloxanes also include branched compounds, the defining feature of which is that each pair of silicon centres is separated by one oxygen atom. The siloxane functional group forms the backbone of silicones, the premier example of which is polydimethylsiloxane. The functional group RSiO- (where the three Rs may be different) is called siloxy. Siloxanes are manmade and have many commercial and industrial applications because of the compounds’ hydrophobicity, low thermal conductivity, and high flexibility. \n\nSiloxanes generally adopt structures expected for linked tetrahedral (\"\"sp\"-like\") centers. The Si–O bond is 1.64 Å (vs Si–C distance of 1.92 Å) and the Si–O–Si angle is rather open at 142.5°. By way of contrast, the C–O distance in a typical dialkyl ether is much shorter at 1.414(2) Å with a more acute C–O–C angle of 111°. It can be appreciated that the siloxanes would have low barriers for rotation about the Si–O bonds as a consequence of low steric hindrance. This geometric consideration is the basis of the useful properties of some siloxane-containing materials, such as their low glass transition temperatures.\n\nThe main route to siloxane functional group is by hydrolysis of silicon chlorides:\n\nThe reaction proceeds via the initial formation of silanols (RSi–OH):\nThe siloxane bond can then form via a silanol + silanol pathway or a silanol + chlorosilane pathway:\n\nHydrolysis of a silyldichloride can afford linear or cyclic products. Linear products are terminated with silanol groups:\nCyclic products have no silanol termini:\n\nThe linear products, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), are of great commercial value. Their production requires the production of dimethylsilicon dichloride.\n\nStarting from trisilanols, cages are possible, such as the species with the formula (RSi)O with cubic () and hexagonal prismatic (). (RSi)O structures. The cubic cages are cubane-type clusters, with silicon centers at the corners of a cube oxygen centres spanning each of the twelve edges.\n\nOxidation of organosilicon compounds, including siloxanes, gives silicon dioxide. This conversion is illustrated by the combustion of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane:\n\nStrong base degrades siloxane group, often affording siloxide salts:\nThis reaction proceeds by production of silanols. Similar reactions are used industrially to convert cyclic siloxanes to linear polymers.\n\nPolysiloxanes, upon combustion in an inert atmosphere, generally undergo pyrolysis to form silicon oxycarbide or silicon carbide (SiC). By exploiting this reaction, polysiloxanes have been used as preceramic polymers in various processes including additive manufacturing. The use of a poly-siloxane precursor in polymer derived ceramics allows the formation of ceramic bodies with complex shapes, although the significant shrinkage in pyrolysis needs to be taken into account.\n\nCyclomethicones are a group of methyl siloxanes, a class of liquid silicones (cyclic polydimethylsiloxane polymers) that possess the characteristics of low viscosity and high volatility as well as being skin emollients and in certain circumstances useful cleaning solvents. Unlike dimethicones, which are \"linear\" siloxanes that do not evaporate, cyclomethicones are \"cyclic\": both groups consist of a polymer featuring a monomer backbone of one silicon and two oxygen atoms bonded together, but instead of having a very long \"linear\" backbone surrounded by a series of methyl groups (which produces a clear, non-reactive, non-volatile liquid ranging from low to high viscosity), cyclomethicones have short backbones that make closed or nearly-closed rings or \"cycles\" with their methyl groups, giving them many of the same properties of dimethicones but making them much more volatile. They are used in many cosmetic products where eventual complete evaporation of the siloxane carrier fluid is desired. In this way they are useful for products like deodorants and antiperspirants which need to coat the skin but not remain tacky afterward. Most cyclomethicone is manufactured by Dow Corning. Cyclomethicones have been shown to involve the occurrence of silanols during biodegration in mammals. The resulting silanols are capable of inhibiting hydrolytic enzymes such as thermolysin, acetylcholinesterase, however the doses required for inhibition are by orders of magnitude higher than the ones resulting from the accumulated exposure to consumer products containing cyclomethicones.\n\nThe word \"siloxane\" is derived from the words silicon, oxygen, and alkane. In some cases, siloxane materials are composed of several different types of siloxane groups; these are labeled according to the number of Si-O bonds.\nM-units: (CH)SiO,\nD-units: (CH)SiO,\nT-units: (CH)SiO\nBecause silicones are heavily used in biomedical and cosmetic applications, their toxicology has been intensively examined. \"The inertness of silicones toward warmblooded animals has been demonstrated in a number of tests.\" With an LD in rats of >50 g/kg, they are virtually nontoxic. Questions remain however about chronic toxicity or the consequences of bioaccumulation since siloxanes can be long-lived.\n\nFindings about bioaccumulation have been largely based on laboratory studies. Field studies of bioaccumulation have not reached consensus. \"Even if the concentrations of siloxanes we have found in fish are high compared to concentrations of classical contaminants like PCBs, several other studies in the Oslo Fjord in Norway, Lake Pepin in the US, and Lake Erie in Canada have shown concentrations of siloxanes decrease at higher range in the food chain. This finding raises questions about which factors influence the bioaccumulation potential of siloxanes.\"\n\nCyclomethicones are ubiquitous because they are widely used in biomedical and cosmetic applications. They can be found at high levels in American cities. They can be toxic to aquatic animals in concentrations often found in the environment. The cyclomethicones D and D are bioaccumulative in some aquatic organisms, according to one report. \n\nIn the European Union, D, D and D have been deemed hazardous as per the REACH regulation. They were characterized as substances of very high concern (SVHC) due to their PBT and vPvB properties. Canada regulates D under a pollution prevention plan. A scientific review in Canada in 2011 concluded that \"Siloxane D5 does not pose a danger to the environment.\"\n\n\n"}

Nicknamed \"El Rey de la Música Ranchera\" (The King of Ranchera Music), Fernández started his career singing for tips on the street, and has since become a cultural icon, recording more than 50 albums and contributing to more than 30 films. His repertoire consists of rancheras and other Mexican classics. He is accompanied live by a mariachi group, but he is not technically a mariachi musician, as he only sings live. Vicente's fame rose after the death of Javier Solís (El Rey del Bolero Ranchero).\n\nFernández's work has earned him three Grammy Awards, eight Latin Grammy Awards, fourteen Lo Nuestro Awards, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He has sold over 50 million copies worldwide, making him one of the best-selling regional Mexican artists of all time. In 2016, Fernández retired from performing live, although he continues to record and publish music.\n\nBorn on 17 February 1940 in the suburb of Huentitán El Alto in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Fernández spent his early years on his father Ramon's ranch on the outskirts of Guadalajara. He also worked at a young age as a waiter, dish washer, cashier, and finally manager of his uncle's restaurant. \"Chente\", as he was commonly known, became fond of the idyllic ranch lifestyle. His mother often took him to see the films of Pedro Infante; he has said of these films' significance: \"When I was 6 or 7, I would go see Pedro Infante's movies, and I would tell my mother, 'When I grow up, I'll be like him.'\" By age 8 he had taken up the guitar and was practicing singing in the style of the ranchera singers he heard on the radio. As a boy, Fernández sang at a festival in Arandas, Mexico where he won the contest. Later, at 12, he won 31 pesos in another contest. In 1954 he won an amateur contest sponsored by a Guadalajara television station. It was his first break into performing and he began to play at local clubs and gatherings. Around this time, however, Fernández's father lost the ranch and the family moved into the city of Tijuana. Fernández, who had dropped out of school in fifth grade, began working jobs in the city such as janitor, dishwasher, waiter and whatever else he could find, all the while holding to his musical aspirations.\n\nIn 1960, Fernández devoted himself to music full-time. He went back to Jalisco, where he performed as a busker and occasionally appeared on the television show \"La calandria musical\". After a couple of years Fernández tried his luck in Mexico City, where he found a job singing in a restaurant called \"El Amanacer Tapatío\". When he wasn't working, he was auditioning -unsuccessfully— for record companies. Discouraged, he left around 1963 to marry María del Refugio \"Cuca\" Abarca Villasenor. They now have three sons: Vicente Jr., Gerardo, and Alejandro. Vicente Jr was born 3 months premature in 1963; Fernández's mother died the same week.\n\nIn the spring of 1966, Javier Solís, Mexico's most popular traditional singer, died. Discos CBS, the recording label in the Mexican department of CBS Records International, offered Fernández a recording contract. He released his first recording, \"Perdóname\", with the company in 1966; Fernández still records for the label, which is now Sony Music Latin of Sony Music Entertainment.\n\nHe branched into acting with the 1971 film \"Tacos al carbón\". His first hit movie, for which he did the soundtrack, was 1974's \"La ley del monte\". He stopped acting in 1991. Maintaining the ranchera tradition, Fernández always performs wearing the charro, an embroidered suit and sombrero.\n\nIn 1970, just as Fernández was about to go onstage, his father died. Overwhelmed by the news but determined not to let the crowd go without a show, Fernández went onstage and performed. By the end of the night the critics were comparing him to other famous ranchera artists like José Alfredo Jiménez, Jorge Negrete, and Javier Solís. Since then his music has expanded rapidly. In 1998, he continued to tour despite the kidnapping of his oldest son. (He was released 4 months later when a ransom of $3.2 million.)\n\nFernández has recorded more than 50 albums in 35 years and claims to have recorded 300 more songs, making another 30 albums possible even if he retires. When he records an album, he spends 12–13 hours in the studio recording up to 18 songs; he takes a day off, then returns for another marathon session of recording another 15 or more songs. From this accumulation, he and his producer choose 12 tracks. Fernández's greatest hit was \"\"Volver, volver,\"\" released in 1972; his first million-selling album was 1983's \"15 Grandes con el número uno\". In 1987 he launched his first tour outside the United States and Mexico when he traveled to Bolivia and Colombia.\nOn 16 April 2016 Vicente Fernández performed for the last time in his career at Estadio Azteca effectively announcing his retirement.\n\nFernández has long been associated with the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI), which governed Mexico from 1929 to 2000 and again between 2012 and 2018. Fernández was one of the many performers who participated in the \"Solidaridad\" campaign during the administration of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, and has also performed at PRI rallies, attended PRI events or meeted with politicians from that party; in one ocassion, he performed the song \"Estos celos\" for then-President Enrique Peña Nieto (a PRI member) during an official celebration. \n\nFernández sparked controversy after some statements he made during an interview on May 2019 regarding his health. Fernández stated that he had been interned at a hospital in Houston, United States to undergo a liver surgery, but he decided to reject a transplant because he did not \"want to sleep with [his] wife while having the liver of another man, who could have been a homosexual or a drug user\". \n\nIn 1990, Fernández released the album \"Vicente Fernandez y las clásicas de José Alfredo Jiménez\", a tribute to Mexico's famous songwriter from Guanajuato known as The \"God of Ranchera Music\" José Alfredo Jiménez, who is also his main musical influence. The album earned him Billboard and Univision's Latin Music Award for Mexican Regional Male Artist of the Year, which he won 5 times from 1989 to 1993.\n\nIn 1998, Fernández was inducted into Billboard's Latin Music Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2002, the Latin Recording Academy recognized Fernández as Person of the Year. That year he celebrated his 35th anniversary in the entertainment industry, a career in which he has sold more than 50 million records and was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame. He has 51 albums listed on the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for gold, platinum, and multiplatinum selling records. He also has his own star on the walk of fame in Hollywood, California; over 5,000 people attended his star-presentation ceremony, which is a record itself.\n\nFernández also has an arena in Guadalajara named in his honor, a star placed with his hand prints and name at the Paseo de las Luminarias in Mexico City. In 2010, Fernández was awarded his first Grammy Award for Best Regional Mexican Album for his record \"Necesito de Tí\".\n\nOn 10 October 2012, a stretch of 26th Street (a street in a Hispanic neighborhood of Chicago called Little Village) was named in his honor. In 2015, Fernández was awarded his second Grammy Award for Best Regional Mexican Music Album (including Tejano) for the album \"Mano A Mano – Tangos A La Manera De Vicente Fernández\".\n\nThe Grammy Awards are awarded annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States. Fernández received three awards from thirteen nominations.\n\nThe Latin Grammy Awards are awarded annually by The Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences of the United States. Fernández received eight awards from fourteen nominations and also earned the Latin Recording Academy for Person of the Year.\n\nThe Lo Nuestro Awards is an awards show honoring the best of Latin music, presented by television network Univision.

{"id": "1942048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1942048", "title": "Gang of 14", "text": "Gang of 14\n\nThe Gang of 14 was a phrase coined to describe the bipartisan group of Senators in the 109th United States Congress who successfully, at the time, negotiated a compromise in the spring of 2005 to avoid the deployment of the so-called \"nuclear option\" by Senate Republicans over an organized use of the filibuster by Senate Democrats. The term alludes to the phrase \"Gang of Four\", used in China to refer to four ex-leaders blamed for the abuses during the rule of Mao Zedong.\n\nSenate Democrats used the filibuster to prevent the confirmation of conservative appellate court candidates nominated by Republican President George W. Bush. In the Republican-controlled 108th Congress, ten Bush judicial nominees were filibustered by the minority Democrats: Miguel Estrada, Priscilla Owen, Charles W. Pickering, Carolyn Kuhl, David McKeague, Henry Saad, Richard Allen Griffin, William H. Pryor, William Gerry Myers III, and Janice Rogers Brown.\n\nAs a result of these ten filibusters, Senate Republican leaders began to threaten to change the existing Senate rules by using what Senator Trent Lott termed the \"nuclear option\" and which Republicans tended to call the \"constitutional option\". This change in rules would eliminate filibusters of judicial confirmation votes.\n\nThe theory behind the \"nuclear option\" was that the Senate had the right to determine its own rules and that those rules could be determined on the basis of a simple majority vote. Democrats objected that the Senate Rules themselves said that a 2/3 majority was required to change Senate rules. Republicans countered that the Senate's power to govern itself was founded in the Constitution itself and that internal Senate rules could not constrain that power.\n\nRepublicans had only a two-vote majority in the 108th Congress, so they were in a weak position to implement this procedural maneuver. Things changed by 2005 due to the 2004 elections. President Bush won re-election, and the Republicans gained three Senate seats for a 55–45 majority in the 109th Congress, so the \"nuclear option\" became a more viable strategy.\n\nBecause of the political split in the Senate at the time (55 Republicans, 44 Democrats and one Independent), if six Senators from each party could reach an agreement, these twelve could both forestall the \"nuclear option\" and enable cloture on nominees. A cloture vote on the nomination of Priscilla Owen was scheduled for Tuesday, May 24, 2005. Its predicted failure was expected to start the Republicans moving to \"nuclear option\". Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and Minority Leader Harry Reid had evidently given up all pretense of finding a compromise (each have been accused of having desired the showdown for their own political ends).\n\nSome Senators in both parties wanted to find an alternative way out. In the end, seven Senators from each party agreed to a compromise which stated, in essence, that Democratic filibusters would come to an end in \"all but extraordinary circumstances,\" and the GOP would not use the \"nuclear option\".\n\nThese Senators, dubbed the \"Gang of 14\", signed an agreement, pertaining to the 109th Congress only. The seven Democrats agreed that they would vote for cloture\non some of the current filibustered judicial nominees and any future filibustered nominees (except in \"extraordinary circumstances,\" as defined by each individual Senator). In return, the seven Republicans agreed they would not vote to carry out the \"nuclear option.\" As the Republicans held a five-vote Senate majority (55–45) in the 109th Congress, this agreement meant that there would be 62 votes for cloture in the specified cases, ending those filibusters, and only 48 votes for the \"nuclear option\", which would be defeated.\n\nWhile thwarting the goals of their respective party leaderships, the group members were hailed as moderates who put aside partisanship to do what was best for the Senate. At the same time, some of the Republican members of the Gang of 14 were attacked by conservatives for their participation in this agreement.\n\nThree of the filibustered nominees (Estrada, Pickering, and Kuhl) had withdrawn. In the 109th Congress, five of the remaining seven filibustered nominees (Owen, McKeague, Griffin, Pryor, and Brown) were confirmed as a result of the deal brokered by the Gang.\n\nThe Gang became active again in July 2005, attempting to advise Bush on the choice of a nominee to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. On November 3, 2005, the group met to discuss the nomination of Samuel Alito to the Court, but came to no conclusions, noting that the hearing process had only just begun in his case. On January 30, 2006, the members of the group unanimously supported a cloture vote on the Alito nomination, providing more than enough votes to prevent a filibuster.\n\nThe Senators listed below served in the 109th Congress. Most have left office and three have died. , only two (Collins and Graham) remain in office.\nAs a result of the agreement, Priscilla Owen was confirmed 55-43, Janice Rogers Brown was confirmed 56-43, and William Pryor was confirmed 53-45. The two nominees who were not specifically guaranteed cloture in the agreement, William Myers and Henry Saad, both later withdrew. Myers of Idaho was opposed by the Democratic leadership because of the perceived anti-environmental bias of his work as solicitor general of the Department of the Interior and deputy general counsel of the Department of Energy. Saad of Michigan, on the other hand, was opposed by his two Democratic home state Senators, Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow, because he had angered Stabenow in September 2003 by sending out an e-mail critical of her participation in his original filibuster. In the e-mail, Saad wrote to a supporter about Stabenow, \"This is the game they play. Pretend to do the right thing while abusing the system and undermining the constitutional process. Perhaps some day she will pay the price for her misconduct.\" Stabenow became aware of the e-mail when Saad accidentally sent it not only to the supporter but also to Stabenow's office.\n\nThe immediate and proximate political result of the agreement was the curtailing of Democratic filibusters and the short-term end to the \"nuclear option\" debate. Three judicial nominees not explicitly mentioned in the original Gang deal were confirmed under its provisions: David McKeague, Richard Allen Griffin and Thomas B. Griffith.\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch at the time characterized the deal as \"a truce, not a ceasefire\", and the potential for a resumption of hostilities was obvious to everyone. The compromise purported to rule out Democratic filibusters in \"all but extraordinary circumstances\", yet the day after the compromise was announced, Harry Reid provocatively announced in a speech on the Senate floor that in his view, the Democrats were \"already\" using the filibuster in only \"extraordinary circumstances\". Sen. Carl Levin made a provocative attempt to shut the door on the \"nuclear option\" by obtaining a ruling from the Senate chair (at that moment, Senator John E. Sununu (R-NH)) that the filibuster had been yielded as constitutional by the compromise, which failed. Thus the Republican leadership retained the nuclear option. Consequently, moderates on both sides were able to claim victory, and partisans on both sides were able to avoid defeat.\n\nThe compromise was further tested by the confirmation battle over the nomination of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy left by Sandra Day O'Connor's retirement. Some Democratic Senators attempted a filibuster; however, the entire Gang of 14 voted for cloture, which passed by 72 to 24 (with 60 \"aye\" votes needed). Several members of the Gang of 14 then voted against confirming Alito, including Republican Lincoln Chafee.\n\nIn April 2006, Senate Republicans began pushing for the confirmation of two controversial conservative Court of Appeals nominees who had not been included in the Gang of 14 deal of 2005: district court judge Terrence Boyle and White House aide Brett Kavanaugh. Boyle had been first nominated to the Fourth Circuit in 2001 and Kavanaugh to the D.C. Circuit in 2003. Reid had then expressed concern over both nominees, threatening a possible of filibuster each one. On May 3, 2006, the seven Democratic members of the Gang of 14 wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, requesting a second hearing for Kavanaugh. That request was granted the next day. On May 9, Kavanaugh appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his second hearing. Later that same day, the Gang of 14 met to discuss his nomination as well as the nomination of Boyle which had become embroiled in a debate concerning Boyle's failure to recuse himself in several cases. After the meeting, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham declared that he saw no \"extraordinary circumstances\" concerning Kavanaugh's nomination. However, several Republican members of the \"Gang\" refused to address the status of Boyle. The Democratic members said they would request a second hearing for Boyle as they had done earlier for Kavanaugh. On Thursday, May 11, Kavanaugh was voted out of committee on a party line vote of 10–8 Two weeks later, on May 25, cloture was invoked on Kavanaugh by a vote of 67–30 with all but two members of the Gang of 14 voting to end debate. Senator Inouye voted against invoking cloture, and Senator Salazar did not vote. The next day, Kavanaugh was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit by a vote of 57–36. All of the Republicans and three of the Democrats (Byrd, Landrieu, and Nelson) in the Gang voted for confirmation.\n\nBefore the Boyle nomination could be addressed, a controversy arose about the nomination of William Haynes, the general counsel of the Department of Defense, to be an appellate judge on the Fourth Circuit. When it was revealed that Republican senator Graham might be holding up Haynes's nomination in committee due to concerns about Haynes' participation in the formulation and implementation of certain torture guidelines suggested by the Bybee memo, there was a conservative uproar. Conservative leaders pressured Graham to get Haynes confirmed. Graham responded to his critics with a letter explaining his position on the nomination. Eventually, Haynes was granted a second hearing as Kavanaugh had been before him. Two days after the July 11 hearing, the Gang met to discuss Haynes' nomination. Their initial response did not seem positive.\n\nBefore any further action could be taken on Haynes, however, his nomination (as well as those of four other controversial appellate nominees including Boyle and previously filibustered nominee William Myers) was returned to the White House according to Senate rules on August 3, 2006 in advance of the annual August recess of Congress. When the Senate returned in September, it was only for a short period before a break for the 2006 midterm election. Although Boyle, Myers and Haynes were renominated, again no action was taken on them in the Senate Judiciary Committee before the break, and their nominations were sent back a second time to the White House on September 29.\n\nThe compromise was successful in precluding further judicial filibusters or the use of the nuclear option during the rest of the 109th Congress. As noted before, the Gang of 14 deal was instrumental in getting Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito an up-or-down vote, as the votes for confirmation (58 for to 42 against) would not have been enough for cloture.\n\nIn the 2006 elections, however, Democratic challengers attacked incumbent Republicans for support of Bush's judicial nominees. In the November 7, 2006 elections, the Democrats gained six additional Senate seats, giving them control in the incoming 110th Congress. Republican \"Gang\" members Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Mike DeWine of Ohio were replaced by Democrats Sheldon Whitehouse and Sherrod Brown.\n\nAfter the elections, President Bush resubmitted the six nominations sent back to him in September. However, Judiciary Committee chairman Senator Arlen Specter said that the Committee would not act on these nominees during the lame duck session of the 109th Congress.\n\nIn the 110th Congress, the Democrats had a 51–49 majority in the Senate, and no longer needed to filibuster nominees. Thus the purpose of the Gang of 14 disappeared. President Bush attempted to reconcile with the Senate Democrats by not renominating Boyle, Myers, and Haynes in January 2007. As the new majority party, the Senate Democrats easily blocked several conservative appellate judicial nominees during the 110th Congress by ordinary methods. Conservative appellate nominees like Peter Keisler, Robert J. Conrad and Steve A. Matthews were blocked in committee and never given a hearing.\n\nIf a Supreme Court justice had chosen to retire during the 110th Congress, it would have been just as easy for the Democrats to have blocked his replacement in committee. Even if the replacement nominee had made it out of committee, then the Democrats still could have defeated him with a party-line vote. As it developed, no Supreme Court justice retired or died during the 110th Congress.\n\nOn November 17, 2009, two members of the Gang of 14 – Senators McCain (R-AZ) and Graham (R-SC) – voted against the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination of David Hamilton, President Obama's pick for a vacant seat on the Seventh Circuit. At the time, neither Senator linked his vote to the \"extraordinary circumstances\" standard announced in the Gang's original agreement. Senator Graham indicated that he thought that Judge Hamilton's views were \"so far removed from the mainstream\" that a vote against cloture was warranted.\n\nThough Democrats were a majority in the Senate after 2006, Republicans blocked several Appellate Court nominees of President Barack Obama by use of the filibuster. On November 22, 2013, at the direction of leader Harry Reid, Senate Democrats used the \"nuclear option\" to revise Senate rules and eliminate filibusters of Presidential nominees, leaving the possibility of filibusters of nominees for the Supreme Court intact. The vote was 52 to 48 – all Republicans and three Democrats (Carl Levin (D-MI), Joe Manchin (D-WV), and Mark Pryor (D-AR)) voting against.\n\nAfter Republicans regained control of the Senate, McCain voted in favor of the nuclear option in order to get Neil Gorsuch confirmed to the Supreme Court. Today, judicial nominations can no longer be filibustered, although the filibuster still exists in general.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1942067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1942067", "title": "Gliadin", "text": "Gliadin\n\nGliadin (a type of prolamin) is a class of proteins present in wheat and several other cereals within the grass genus \"Triticum\". Gliadins, which are a component of gluten, are essential for giving bread the ability to rise properly during baking. Gliadins and glutenins are the two main components of the gluten fraction of the wheat seed. This gluten is found in products such as wheat flour. Gluten is split about evenly between the gliadins and glutenins, although there are variations found in different sources.\n\nGliadin is the water-insoluble component of gluten, and glutenin is water-soluble. There are three main types of gliadin (α, γ, and ω), to which the body is intolerant in coeliac (or celiac) disease. Diagnosis of this disease has recently been improving.\n\nGliadin can cross the intestinal epithelium. Breast milk of healthy human mothers who eat gluten-containing foods presents high levels of non-degraded gliadin.\n\nThe α, γ, and ω gliadin types are separated and distinguished based on their amino acid sequences in the N-terminal cysteine domain.\n\nGliadins are prolamins and are separated on the basis of electrophoretic mobility and isoelectric focusing. Gliadin peptides cross the intestinal barrier by active transport.\n\nGliadins are known for their role, along with glutenin, in the formation of gluten. They are slightly soluble in ethanol and contain only intramolecular disulfide links. They also cause some of the best examples of food-derived pathogenesis. People with gluten-sensitive enteropathy (the severe form of which is celiac disease) are sensitive to α, β, and γ gliadins. Those with WD urticaria and Baker's asthma are sensitive to ω-gliadins.\n\nGliadin can also serve as a useful delivery method for sensitive enzymes (such as superoxide dismutase, which is fused with gliadin to form glisodin) – this helps protect them from stomach acids that cause breakdown.\n\nFor useful description of the gliadins see:\n\nDeamidated gliadin is produced by acid or enzymatic treatment of gluten. The enzyme tissue transglutaminase converts some of the abundant glutamines to glutamic acid. This is done because gliadins are soluble in alcohol and cannot be mixed with other foods (like milk) without changing the foods' qualities. Deamidated gliadin is soluble in water. The cellular immunity to deamidated α-/β-gliadin is much greater than α/β-gliadin and can result in symptomatic gluten-sensitive enteropathy.\n\nCeliac disease is a chronic, immune-mediated intestinal disorder, in which the body becomes intolerant to gliadin, which is a component of gluten. Individuals with celiac disease exhibit a lifelong intolerance of wheat, barley and rye – all of which contain prolamins. Gliadin proteins have the ability to provoke an autoimmune enteropathy caused by an abnormal immune response in genetically susceptible individuals. Specific amino acid sequences within the gliadin proteins are responsible for this activity.\n\nThe main problems with this disease is that it often goes unrecognized for many years, in which it can cause serious damage to several organs, and most cases currently remain unrecognized, undiagnosed and untreated. Mainly intestinal villi destruction mediated by Interferon Gamma and CD 4(+). Celiac disease with \"non-classic symptoms\" is the most common clinical type and occurs in older children (over 2 years old), adolescents and adults. It is characterized by milder or even absent gastrointestinal symptoms and a wide spectrum of non-intestinal manifestations that can involve any organ of the body, and very frequently may be completely asymptomatic both in children (at least in 43% of the cases) and adults. Untreated celiac disease may cause malabsorption, reduced quality of life, iron deficiency, osteoporosis, an increased risk of intestinal lymphomas and greater mortality. It is associated with some autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes mellitus type 1, thyroiditis, gluten ataxia, psoriasis, vitiligo, autoimmune hepatitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and more.\n\nThe only available treatment for celiac disease is a strict gluten-free diet in which the diseased person does not ingest any gluten. There have been searches for an affordable and much better treatment, but the only treatment remains to abstain from ingesting any gluten.\n\n"}

It originally aired on October 9, 1995.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy. In this episode, an accident leaves Captain Benjamin Sisko frozen in time, leaving Jake with a lifelong obsession of rescuing his father while having his resolve tested when they briefly reunite every few decades.\n\nThe episode was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 1996, but lost to \"Babylon 5\"s \"The Coming of Shadows\". It consistently ranks in polls as one of the most popular episodes of the entire series, often vying for first place with \"In the Pale Moonlight\" and \"Trials and Tribble-ations\", with one critic writing that the episode \"sums up everything that made \"DS9\" so unforgettable.\"\n\nThe elderly Jake Sisko (Tony Todd) is visited by Melanie (Rachel Robinson), an aspiring writer, who is curious to learn why Jake gave up writing. Jake tells her his story, revealed as flashbacks in the episode.\n\nWhen Jake was eighteen, his father Captain Benjamin Sisko took him on the USS \"Defiant\" to observe an inversion of the Bajoran Wormhole. The inversion causes a malfunction in the \"Defiant\"s warp drive; a bolt of energy strikes Benjamin, causing him to vanish into subspace. Believing him dead, Jake and the crew of Deep Space Nine mourn him; but a few months later, Jake catches sight of his father for a brief moment. A year after the incident, Benjamin appears again, but the crew is unable to return him to the normal flow of time.\n\nWhen the Klingon Empire assumes control of Deep Space Nine, Jake returns to Earth. He eventually achieves success as an author, marries and settles down. When his father appears again, Jake introduces him to his wife and shows him the books he's published. He apologizes for moving on with his life instead of attempting to save his father, but Benjamin is proud of his son's accomplishments. When Benjamin disappears again, Jake decides to help him; he returns to school to study subspace mechanics, abandoning his writing career and marriage.\n\nDecades later, the wormhole is to undergo another inversion, and Jake attempts to recreate the accident on the \"Defiant\". The attempt briefly sends him into subspace with his father. During this \"visit\", Benjamin is disappointed that Jake has abandoned his writing and marriage in order to save him, and begs him to return to his true passions and live out his life for his own sake. Jake returns without his father and tries to determine what went wrong with the rescue attempt. But eventually he honors his father's request to rebuild his life by returning to writing.\n\nOn the night of Melanie's visit, Jake knows his father will appear again. He has injected himself with a lethal hypospray dose, believing that, by dying when his father is present, Jake will allow him to return to a time before the warp core incident. The next morning, Benjamin appears as expected, and Jake tells him that his death will give them both a \"second chance\". Jake dies in his father's arms; Benjamin finds himself back on the \"Defiant\", and dodges the energy discharge. Confused, young Jake asks what happened. Benjamin tearfully responds, \"I guess we got lucky this time.\"\n\nThe script was written by Michael Taylor, who would later join the writing staff until \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\"s conclusion; once finished, he moved on to help write \"\" during its final three seasons. He also co-wrote \"In the Pale Moonlight\", another critically acclaimed episode of \"Deep Space Nine\". Showrunner Ira Steven Behr noted that the everlasting love in the episode wasn't a romance, but something altogether more relatable: the devotion of a son to his father.\n\nAlthough the episode was always intended to be the second episode of the season, it was filmed third; \"\" was filmed prior to accommodate Colm Meaney's (Miles O'Brien) schedule on a film.

He felt that \"Everyone who gets substantive screen time puts in a great performance here\", also commending Terry Farrell (Jadzia Dax), Alexander Siddig (Julian Bashir), and Aron Eisenberg (Nog). DeCandido summarized his thoughts on the episode by writing, \"Just a great great hour of television. One of the finest there has ever been\", and awarded the episode a \"warp factor rating\" of 10/10. Jamahl Epsicokhan of Jammer's Reviews gave the episode 4/4 stars. He felt \"The Visitor\" was a \"moving, thematic tale [that] is one of the most brilliantly realized character pieces I've seen on television.\" He lauded Michael Taylor's story, David Livingston's direction, the editing and the music. Ending his review, Epsicokhan wrote, \"Even if you're grabbing the tissues by the end of this episode (I was) there is no way you can call this story maudlin or melodramatic. It's completely absorbing from the first frame to the last; definitely one of \"DS9\"s finest moments. There is true magic working here.\" \"The A.V. Club\"s Zack Handlen reviewed the episode standalone rather than alongside another episode – he had done so similarly in his review for \"\" – and interspersed his review with memories with his own father. Handlen explained that he was reduced to tears when old Jake woke up to find his father watching him and smiling towards the end of the episode.\n\nAnalyzing \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\"s representation of black fatherhood in America through the characters of Benjamin and Jake Sisko, Vulture's Angelica Jade Bastién wrote how the \"beauty of [their] relationship is perhaps never better portrayed than in the season-four episode “The Visitor.” [...] Seeing black men cry, grapple with the historical importance of their existence, and remain beautifully, dynamically human is something no other science-fiction series on television has done with such panache.\" In 2018, the website had rated \"The Visitor\" the second-best episode of \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\".\n\n\"The Visitor\" was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 1996, although \"Babylon 5\"s \"The Coming of Shadows\" won; during his review of \"The Visitor\", Keith DeCandido wrote that he was present at the Hugo Awards in Los Angeles at the time and noted that the clip they showed for the episode cut off before the emotional scene between Captain Sisko and his son – while he liked \"Babylon 5\"s \"The Coming of Shadows\", he felt that this episode was \"seriously robbed\". It was ranked as the tenth best \"Star Trek\" episode for \"TV Guide\"s celebration of the franchise's 30th anniversary.\n\nBased on user ratings, \"The Visitor\" holds a 9.2/10 on TV.com and a 9.1/10 on IMDb.

IMDb ranks it at third place (between \"In the Pale Moonlight\" and \"Duet\") based on over 1,200 user ratings, as did About.com's Nigel Mitchell. Den of Geek's Gem Wheeler considered the episode the best of the series and thought that if one was only going to watch one episode of \"Deep Space Nine\", then this episode should be it, writing, \"quite simply, one of the finest hours of \"Star Trek\" ever made.\" In a poll conducted on the official \"Star Trek\" website to determine the best episode of \"Deep Space Nine\", \"Trials and Tribble-ations\" won, leaving the staff to ponder why \"remarkable episodes as \"The Visitor,\" \"What You Leave Behind,\" \"\" and \"Far Beyond the Stars\"\" didn't receive the necessary votes to challenge the winner in earlier rounds.\n\nFurther websites have attempted to compare \"The Visitor\" to other \"Star Trek\" episodes: IGN ranked it the 15th best episode of all \"Star Trek\" series; \"Radio Times\" ranked it the 7th best episode of \"Star Trek\" for those unfamiliar with the franchise; CBR ranked it the sixth best time-travel episode of all of \"Star Trek\"; and a binge-watching guide for \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" by W.I.R.E.D. recommended not skipping this \"essential\" episode.\n\n"}

Chinese forces were commanded by Yan Xishan (warlord of Shanxi), Wei Lihuang (14th Army Group), and Fu Zuoyi (7th Army Group), as well as Zhu De who led the Eighth Route Army of the Chinese Communist Party (under the Second United Front alliance).\n\nOccupation of the territories gave the Japanese access to coal from Datong in northern Shanxi, but also exposed them to attacks by the guerrilla forces of the Nationalist army including the Eighth Route Army, tying down many Japanese troops which could have been diverted to other campaigns.\n\nIn September 1937, Hideki Tojo sent the Japanese army stationed in Chahar to invade Shanxi in order to exploit its resources. The city of Datong fell, and the NRA was forced to go on the defensive, and concentrated their troops along the Great Wall in battles at places like Pingxingguan and to the east at Niangziguan.\n\nYan Xishan also sent troops to reinforce Shijiazhuang, but that caused a lack of personnel to defend the North China area, allowing the Japanese army to break through in the north forcing the Chinese to fall back to a new line at Xinkou. Fighting continued in October in the Battle of Xinkou until the Japanese outflanked Niangziguan in late October, compromising the Chinese defense resulting in the fall of Taiyuan.\n\n"}

It saw action on the Eastern Front during World War II from November 1941.\n\nIn February 1945, the 4th SS Brigade Nederland was merged into the SS Division Nordland, but after protests from the Dutch Nazi party, the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands, it was formed into its own SS Panzergrenadier Division, although its strength never reached more than a brigade.\n\nAfter the invasion of Poland in 1939, Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, sought to expand the Waffen-SS with foreign volunteers for the \"crusade against Bolshevism\". The enrollment began in April 1940 with the creation of two regiments: the Waffen-SS Regiment Nordland (for Danish, Norwegian and Swedish volunteers), and the Waffen-SS Regiment Westland (for Dutch and Flemish volunteers).\n\nThe recruitment drive in The Netherlands was given an air of respectability by the support of Dutch General Staff officer Lieutenant-General Hendrik Seyffardt. The drive was successful, and by April 1941, volunteers began arriving in Hamburg. By July 1941, the Dutch were organized into SS Volunteer Unit Niederlande. The formation was the size of a reinforced infantry battalion, with five motorized companies. The unit was again redesignated, this time as SS Volunteer Legion Niederlande. General Seyffardt was appointed to command the unit. In November 1941, the legion was ordered to the front near Leningrad, under the overall command of Army Group North Rear Area.\n\nThe Legion arrived at the Volkhov River in mid-January 1942 and was engaged in rear-security activities. In late June, it was transferred north in support of units at the Siege of Leningrad. The unit was then to take part in an offensive Operation Nordlicht, which was ultimately called off to deal with the Soviet Sinyavino Offensive. The Legion was then moved south near Lake Ladoga. At the end of 1942, it was merged with the 2nd SS Infantry Brigade. On 6 February, General Seyffardt, while campaigning for new recruits in Amsterdam, was assassinated by the Dutch resistance. \n\nIn April 1943, the unit was sent to Germany to be reformed as the SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Brigade Nederland. The brigade was to consist of two Panzergrenadier regiments under the command of SS-Oberführer Jürgen Wagner. In September 1943, the Brigade sent to the Independent State of Croatia (Yugoslavia) to join SS-Obergruppenführer Felix Steiner's III SS Panzer Corps currently forming in the area. Upon its arrival, the Brigade received 1,500 Dutch recruits, drawn from the SS Division Wiking. During its time there, elements of the brigade were engaged in rear-security operations. During this period, the brigade was redesignated 4th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Brigade Nederland. At this time, its strength stood at 9,342 men.\n\nOn 25 December 1943, the brigade was transferred, along with Steiner's SS Corps, to Oranienbaum, Russia in Army Group North's sector. The corps was deployed to the area near Oranienbaum as part of the 18th Army. The Soviet Krasnoye Selo–Ropsha Offensive cut through the weak infantry units formed out of the 9th and 10th Luftwaffe Field Divisions. The unit, alongside the SS Division Nordland, soon retreated to avoid encirclement by General Leonid A. Govorov's Leningrad Front. In the face of the Soviet Kingisepp–Gdov Offensive, the unit retreated to the Narva River in Estonia, where it took part in the Battle of Narva deployed on the Ivangorod bridgehead.\n\nThe launch of Operation Bagration on 22 June threatened the German positions. On 23 July, Steiner ordered a withdrawal to the Tannenberg Line. The unit was destroyed from the air on 24 July, with only a few personnel reached the Tannenberg Line a week later. The regiment was ordered to be reformed at Schlochau. In September, Leon Degrelle's battle group from SS Brigade Wallonien was placed under the command of Nederland.\n\nThe unit arrived in the area near Gumi-Wolmar in mid-October. The Soviet forces cut off Army Group North in the Courland area, creating the Courland Pocket. During the unit's presence in Courland, Wagner ordered the reprisal executions of an unknown number of civilians. On 26 January 1945, the brigade received orders to evacuate the pocket by sea and report to the Swinemünde-Stettin area to participate in the defence of the Oder line. The brigade arrived in German territory on 4 February.\n\nOn 10 February, the brigade was redesignated 23rd SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Nederland, with a strength of 1,000 men. The new division was attached to Steiner's Eleventh SS Panzer Army, defending the Northern Oder region. The Nederland took part in the abortive Operation Sonnenwende, and the battles near Altdamm in February 1945.\n\nIn April 1945, the division was split into two battle groups. The Soviet offensive of 16 April had broken the German lines by 25 April, cutting the lines of communication between the two units. One of the battle groups broke out to the west, surrendering to the US Army. The other battle group was pushed south by the Soviet offensive, into the area around Halbe. The remnants of the unit were absorbed into \"Kampfgruppe Vieweger\" of the 15th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Latvian). The unit was destroyed in the Halbe pocket.\n\nAfter the war, the unit personnel were tried in the Netherlands, with several death sentences handed down. Wagner was extradited to Yugoslavia in 1947 to stand trial for war crimes. Found guilty before the Yugoslav military tribunal, he was sentenced to death and executed on 27 June 1947.\n\n"}
{"id": "1942160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1942160", "title": "Gone (band)", "text": "Gone (band)\n\nGone is a three-piece punk-based instrumental rock band, formed by Greg Ginn in late 1985. Originally, Gone was a side project to his main group, Black Flag.\n\nPrior to forming Gone, Ginn had been performing some instrumental compositions with Black Flag themselves. For Gone, Ginn tapped bassist Andrew Weiss and drummer Sim Cain, who had previously played together in the band Regressive Aid. They recorded their first album, \"Let's Get Real, Real Gone For A Change\", in late 1985 and released it in 1986 on Ginn's SST Records label. The album title comes from an Elvis Presley quote uttered on his Sun Records-era recording \"Milkcow Blues Boogie\"; the actual quote is both attributed on the back cover of the album, and sampled into the album's second song, \"Get Gone\".\n\nGone were the opening act for Black Flag's entire 1986 tour, which lasted for the first six months of the year. On a typical day during the tour, Gone would perform one set at an in-store appearance, then go down to the venue where Black Flag were headlining, set up, and open the show. Ginn's only break in the evening would be when the second opening band, Painted Willie, performed; he would then get onstage with Black Flag and play a 90-minute set.\n\nDuring a break between 1986 tour legs, Gone recorded their second album, \"Gone II: But Never Too Gone\".\n\nIn August 1986, Ginn disbanded Black Flag after ten years, presumably to concentrate on Gone and on running SST, but Ginn suddenly disbanded the group not long after \"Gone II But Not Too Gone\" was released. By the time the new year started, Weiss and Cain would join former Black Flag singer Henry Rollins in the Rollins Band.\n\nIn 1993, Ginn revived the Gone name and recruited a new rhythm section, bassist Steve Sharp and drummer Gregory Moore, both of whom had played on instrumental tracks Ginn recorded and released on his second and third solo albums, \"Dick\" and \"Let It Burn\". This line up recorded four albums. Gone went quiet in 1998, coinciding with a near decade of silence from SST Records. Ginn and Gone returned in 2007 with \"The Epic Trilogy\", a double CD consisting of 3 lengthy tracks (disc one featured instrumental versions of the songs and disc two featured guest vocals from Bad Brains vocalist H.R.). Greg played both guitar and bass, Andy Batwinas (who had engineer a number of albums for SST in the 1990s) provided keyboards and percussion, and the drums were handled by Moore, who now performs under the pseudonym \"Drummer\".\n\nAnother band called \"Gone\" exists, and their two albums have mistakenly been combined with the original band's on the AllMusic.com database. However, they have absolutely no connection whatsoever to either Ginn or his record label.\n\n\n\n"}

Lorillard IV (October 13, 1833 – July 7, 1901) was an American tobacco manufacturer and Thoroughbred race horse owner.\n\nBorn in Westchester, New York, he was the son of Pierre Lorillard III (1796–1867) and Catherine Griswold. In 1760, his great-grandfather, and namesake, founded P. Lorillard and Company in New York City to process tobacco, cigars, and snuff. Today, Lorillard Tobacco Company is the oldest tobacco company in the U.S.\n\nIn the early 1880s, Lorillard helped make Newport, Rhode Island a yachting center with his schooner \"Vesta\" and a steam yacht \"Radha.\" He owned a summer estate in Newport called \"The Breakers\", which he sold to Cornelius Vanderbilt II in 1882 in order to use his newly developed estate, the Tuxedo Club, at what became known as Tuxedo Park in Orange County, New York. Lorillard had inherited 13,000 acres (53 km²) around Tuxedo Lake, which he developed in conjunction with William Waldorf Astor and other wealthy associates into a luxury retreat. Lorillard hired famed architect Bruce Price to design his clubhouse and the many \"cottages\" of the era along with landscape architect Arthur P. Kroll, in 1929. Lorillard was also a member of the Jekyll Island Club, also known as The Millionaires Club, and the Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York.\n\nWhile it has been reported that Lorillard's son, Griswold Lorillard, introduced the then-unnamed tuxedo to the United States in 1886 at the Tuxedo Club's Autumn Ball, this is now known to be incorrect. While Griswold and his friends did create a stir by wearing unorthodox clothing, their jackets were closer to tailcoats without tails, or what would now be called a mess jacket.\n\nAn avid sportsman, Pierre Lorillard and his brother, George Lyndes Lorillard, were both major figures in Thoroughbred horse racing. In 1874, Pierre's horse, Saxon, won the Belmont Stakes. Although his horse Parole finished fourth in the 1876 Kentucky Derby, it went on to race with considerable success both in the United States and in Europe. In the 19th century, shipping horses from New York to Louisville, Kentucky was a major undertaking and as the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes were both held in the New York City area in the period, neither of the Lorillard brothers entered horses again in the Kentucky Derby. Pierre Lorillard established Rancocas Stable, named for the New Jersey town where he owned a country house. He spent time in Paris and in England where, in 1881, his horse Iroquois became the first American-owned and bred horse to win a European classic race. Ridden by the champion English jockey Fred Archer, Iroquois won The Derby and then went on to capture the St. Leger Stakes as well. Lorillard had other successes in England, notably with the horse named for the actor David Garrick, which won the 1901 Chester Cup ridden by American jockey, Danny Maher.\n\nBeyond his interest in racehorses, Lorillard was a scholar who financed the Central American expedition of the French archaeologist Désiré Charnay and his publication of \"\"The Ancient Cities of the New World. Being Travels and Explorations in Mexico and Central America from 1857–1882\".\" For making the project possible, the government of France awarded Lorillard the Legion of Honor. Charnay named some Maya ruins \"Lorillard City\" in his honor, but the name did not stick, and the site is better known as Yaxchilan. Lorillard also helped finance some of the explorations of Augustus Le Plongeon.\n\nIn 1858, Lorillard married Emily Taylor (1840–1925), the daughter of Isaac Ebenezer Taylor (b. 1815) and Eliza Mary Mollan Taylor (d. 1867). Together, they had four children:\n\n\nPierre Lorillard died in 1901, aged 67, and was interred in the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. His wife Emily died in 1925 and was interred next to him.\n\nLorillard Place in The Bronx is named for him and his brother George.\n\nHe was the step-grandfather of the artist Peter Hill Beard.\n\nThrough his daughter's second marriage, Lorillard was an ancestor of the present Baron Revelstoke and of the heir apparent to the earldom of Oxford and Asquith.\n\n"}

After his playing career ended, Jones joined the Cavaliers coaching staff.\n\nJones played for the Ball High School Golden Tornadoes basketball team. He went on to the University of Houston after his graduation in 1994.\n\nA journeyman throughout his career, Jones never played for the same team for more than one season except for 2005–2008, when he played for the Cleveland Cavaliers. In his career, he played for ten different teams.\n\nJones was most notable for his ability to make three-point field goals. In fact, three-point attempts made up the majority of his field goal attempts because his role was often to wait on the outside while teammates such as Shaquille O'Neal, Dwyane Wade or LeBron James forced double teams. Jones was supremely confident of his shot, once proclaiming that he is \"the best shooter in the world.\"\n\nPrior to the 2004–2005 season, Jones signed a one-year, $2.5 million contract with the Miami Heat. Jones then proceeded to have the best statistical season of his career, setting career highs in games started (66), minutes played (2,576), field goals made (331) and attempted (726), field goal percentage (45.6%), three-point field goals made (225) and attempted (521), three-point field goal percentage (43.2%), free throws made (68) and attempted (86), rebounds (231), steals (44), blocked shots (5) and points scored (955).\nHis 225 three-point field goals made was third best in the NBA (and at the time, tied with Mitch Richmond for the ninth most ever in an NBA season) and his three-point field goal percentage was fifth best that season.\n\nJones had a career-high 31 points on February 16, 2005 against the Los Angeles Clippers and scored in double figures on 48 occasions.

He had a playoff high 8 points in a game four Eastern Conference Semifinal win against the Detroit Pistons.\n\nOn May 5, 2006 Jones came off the bench late in Game 6 of the Cavs' Eastern Conference first-round series against the Washington Wizards. In his first minute of the game action, in overtime, he hit the game-winning shot to clinch the series four games to two, and sent the Cavs into the second round of the NBA Playoffs for the first time since 1993.\n\nIn 60 games played during the 2006–2007 regular season, Jones averaged 6.6 points and 1.6 assists per game. He shot 38.5% from three-point range. On November 13, 2006, he had a season-high 29 points on a season-high 7 three-point field goals.\n\nJones was selected to participate in the Three-Point Shootout during the 2007 All-Star Weekend in Las Vegas, Nevada. Jones finished in fifth place.\n\nIn the 2007 NBA Playoffs, Jones played in 11 games, averaged 2.4 points and hit 31.8% of his three-pointers. He had a playoff high 9 points on three three-point field goals in a game one NBA Final loss to the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nJones played in 68 regular season games (three starts) for the Cavaliers.

He studied at Padua and Bologna, received in 1529 from his older brother a canonicate at Trento and the parish of Tirol near Meran, was in 1536 a Canon of Salzburg, in 1537 of Brixen, and in 1539 became Prince-Bishop of Trento. Being only a subdeacon at the time, he was promoted to the deaconship, priesthood and episcopate in 1542.\n\nIn January 1543, he was appointed administrator of the Bishopric of Brixen, and shortly afterwards, during the same year, he was raised to the dignity of a cardinal by Pope Paul III.

Among other things he insisted that the reform of the Church should be taken up in earnest, a matter much desired by Charles V, and by which it was hoped to win the Protestants back to the Church. It was largely due to his efforts that this subject was discussed and enactments of that character were passed in each session together with decisions on doctrinal matters.

Cliffe is a video game designer who co-created the \"Half-Life\" mod \"Counter-Strike\" with Minh Le and started the \"Counter-Strike\" series. He is also the \"voice of \"Counter-Strike\"\" via the radio commands and sound effects and has also worked on maps for \"\".\n\nHe attended Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University from 1999 to 2003.\n\nBefore getting involved with the original \"Counter-Strike\", Jess Cliffe was a very active gaming website designer. The earliest known gaming website he founded was \"Jedi Knight Multiplayer Addon Group\" (JKMAG) which he founded in December 1997. After around a year of maintaining the website, he moved on to start the website \"Action Quake2 Map Depot\". It was during the time he was involved with this site that he got to know Marcelo Dilay and Minh Le as Dilay and Le were part of the team developing \"Action Quake 2\". Around January 1999, Cliffe also founded the website \"Silo X\" devoted to \"Half-Life\" maps.\n\nAfter graduating Cliffe took a job with Valve, where he was employed as a game designer, 3D artist and level designer. However, he was suspended from Valve in early 2018 due to being arrested.\n\nOn February 2, 2018 at 1:17 a.m. PST, Cliffe was arrested on allegations of \"sexual exploitation of a minor\" in the Southwest Precinct of Seattle.\n\nCliffe allegedly met a girl online via an adult website, SeekingArrangement.com, and paid her for a date which became sexual. Cliffe maintained that he thought he was paying a \"matchmaking fee\" on a dating website for adults. In the encounter, the girl claimed that Cliffe videotaped their encounter \"against her will\" but that she also \"refrained from saying anything.\" Cliffe denied that he videotaped the encounter.\nThe girl, then 16, told investigators she communicated with Cliffe via text message. According to police, Cliffe told officers he believed the girl was 23 years old, and the teenager also said she wasn't sure he knew she was 16. To make an account on the SeekingArrangement.com website, you must enter that you are at least 18 or older in your profile. The case started in May 2017 when the King County Sheriff's Office received a Child Protective Services referral.\n\nThe age of consent in Washington State is 16.\n\nOn October 8, 2018, King County prosecutors offered Cliffe a plea deal which he accepted. The original charge was lowered considerably to \"Assault 2nd degree\" even though no physical assault took place. This practice, known as \"Prosecutorial discretion,\" is a form of plea bargaining in order to resolve a case in which there are mitigating circumstances instead of going to trial. This plea deal was a form of Alford Plea, whereby a defendant in a criminal case does not admit to the criminal act and asserts innocence. Cliffe was sentenced on November 2, 2018 by Judge Julie Spector to 3 months of work release or jail time to begin on January 2, 2019.\n\nOn March 6, 2019, and edited in April 2019, Cliffe wrote on Reddit that he \"never recorded this person at all\" and passed a polygraph test on this subject. Cliffe was never charged based on this allegation as police did view the contents of his phone and found nothing. He also shared that he was offered \"work release\" as part of his plea deal instead of jail but since he was suspended by Valve had to instead spend \"57 days (less than 2 months) in a minimum security facility in Kent, WA\" (the Maleng Regional Justice Center) where he helped out unsupervised around the facility. Cliffe also wrote that \"despite a good faith effort on my end to do due diligence, I still got catfished—on a dating website for adults where you have to state that you are over 18.\" He said the evidence showed \"that there was never a sexual quid pro quo, and it pointed to me looking for a long term relationship.\" In addition, he summarized the situation as \"very unfortunate\" and warned others to \"be very careful with people you meet over the internet, always ask for an ID no matter what, trust but verify, watch out for scammers.\"\n"}

Founded by the writers Heidi Julavits, Vendela Vida, and Ed Park in 2003, the magazine is a five-time finalist for the National Magazine Award, with contributors ranging from literary luminaries such as Hilton Als, Anne Carson, Nick Hornby, Susan Straight, and William T. Vollmann to emerging talents for whom the magazine has been a proving ground, including Eula Biss, Gideon Lewis-Kraus, Leslie Jamison, Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah, Kent Russell, and Rivka Galchen.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2015, \"The Believer\" was published by McSweeney's, the independent press founded in 1998 by Dave Eggers. Eggers designed \"The Believer\" original design template. Park left \"The Believer\" in 2011, with Julavits and Vida continuing to serve as editors. In 2017, the magazine found a new home, moving from McSweeney's to the Beverly Rogers, Carol C. Harter Black Mountain Institute, an international literary center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \"The Believer\" is currently edited by Joshua Wolf Shenk.\n\nFirst published in April 2003, the literary magazine was published in San Francisco by friends who planned to \"focus on writers and books we like,\" with a nod to \"the concept of the inherent Good.\" The print edition was initially published monthly. From late 2007 until September 2014, the print magazine came out 9 times per year, including annual Art, Music, and Film issues that sometimes featured a CD or DVD insert or other ephemera. In 2005, it was printing about 15,000 copies of its regular issues.\n\n\"The Believer\" is a magazine, as its co-editor Heidi Julavits writes, that urges readers and writers to \"reach beyond their usual notions of what is accessible or possible.\" The critic Peter Carlson praised the magazine's essays as \"highbrow but delightfully bizarre.\" Its book reviews may assess writers of other eras and interviews with writers, artists, musicians and directors often conducted by colleagues in their fields. \"Ploughshares\" editor Don Lee called it a \"utopian literary magazine. This is the sort of thing everyone dreams of – having this quality of staff on board.\" Writing in the \"New York Times\", A.O. Scott described the magazine as part of \"a generational struggle against laziness and cynicism, to raise once again the banners of creative enthusiasm and intellectual engagement,\" noting its \"cosmopolitan frame of reference and an eclectic internationalism,\" mixing pop genres with literary theory.\n\nThe magazine includes several feature essays in each issue but also draws on a stable of recurring features. Past and recurring columns include \"Sedaratives,\" an advice column founded by Amy Sedaris that hosts a guest contributor every issue, such as Buck Henry, Eugene Mirman, and Thomas Lennon; \"Stuff I've Been Reading\" by Nick Hornby, a mixture of book discussion and musings; \"Real Life Rock Top Ten: A Monthly Column of Everyday Culture and Found Objects,\" written by Greil Marcus; \"What the Swedes Read\", by Daniel Handler, which examines the work of Nobel Prize Winners; and \"Musin's and Thinkin's,\" by Jack Pendarvis. All issues include a two-page, multi-color design feature called \"Schema,\" whose theme has ranged from \"Forensic Sketches of Literary Criminals\" to \"Habitats of Regional Burger Chains.\"\n\nIllustrations and cartoons are featured throughout the magazine. Until late 2014, the cover illustrations for all regular issues were done by Charles Burns, while most of the other portraits and line drawings are by Tony Millionaire (following Gilbert Hernandez from the fifth issue on). Michael Kupperman's \"Four-Color Comics\" has appeared in many issues, and in most issues a series of images from a given artist or other source run as spot illustrations throughout the articles à la \"The New Yorker\". \"The Believer\" debuted a comics section in the 2009 Art Issue, edited by Alvin Buenaventura, that includes strips by Anders Nilsen, Lilli Carré, Simon Hanselmann and Matt Furie. These comics are exclusive to the print edition of the magazine.\n\nMcSweeney's has published a number of books under \"The Believer\" Books imprint, such as Nick Hornby's \"The Polysyllabic Spree\" (2004), \"Housekeeping vs. The Dirt\" (2006), \"Shakespeare Wrote for Money\" (2008), and \"More Baths Less Talking\" (2012), collections of his \"Stuff I've Been Reading\" column. Other titles include Tom Bissell's \"Magic Hours\" (2012), Tamler Sommers's \"A Very Bad Wizard: Morality Behind the Curtain\" (2009), and anthologies of essays and interviews including \"Read Hard\" (2009) and \"Read Harder\" (2014), \"The Believer Book of Writers Talking to Writers\" (2008), \"Always Apprentices\" (2013), and \"Confidence, or the Appearance of Confidence\" (2014).\n\nSince 2005, the Believer Book Award is presented annually to novels and story collections the magazine's editors thought were the \"strongest and most under-appreciated\" of the year. A shortlist and longlist are announced, along with readers' favorites, then a final winner is selected by the magazine's editors. In 2011, the Believer Poetry Award was inaugurated using the same model. Since 2015, the editors' favorites book selections have been compiled and annotated on The Believer Logger.\n\n"}

{"id": "1942210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1942210", "title": "Arnold Air Force Base", "text": "Arnold Air Force Base\n\nArnold Air Force Base (Arnold AFB) is a United States Air Force base located in Coffee and Franklin counties, Tennessee, adjacent to the city of Tullahoma. It is named for General Henry \"Hap\" Arnold, the father of the U.S. Air Force.\n\nThere is no longer an active airfield on the base, as the airfield was decommissioned in 2009. Army aviation assets (helicopters) continue to utilize Arnold as part of missions supporting Fort Campbell, Kentucky or the Tennessee Army National Guard.\n\nThe base is home to the Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC), the most advanced and largest complex of flight simulation test facilities in the world. The center operates 58 aerodynamic and propulsion wind tunnels, rocket and turbine engine test cells, space environmental chambers, arc heaters, ballistic ranges and other specialized units. AEDC is an Air Force Test Center organization.\n\nThe commander of Arnold Engineering Development Center is Col. Scott A. Cain. and Mark A. Mehalic is the Executive Director.\n\nCamp Forrest, located in Tullahoma, Tennessee, was constructed as one of the Army's largest training bases during the World War II period between 1941 and 1946. The camp, named after Confederate American Civil War cavalryman Nathan Bedford Forrest, was originally named Camp Peay. Camp Peay was named after 1920s Tennessee Governor Austin Peay and built east of Tullahoma, Tenn. as a National Guard Camp in 1926. Camp Peay covered . Camp Forrest covered located just beyond the old Camp Peay.\n\nThe camp was a training area for infantry, artillery, engineer, and signal organizations. It also served as a hospital center and temporary encampment area for troops during maneuvers. Major General George S. Patton brought his 2nd Armored Division, “Hell on Wheels,” from Fort Benning, Georgia for maneuvers. Incoming troops were provided with amenities such as service clubs, guest houses, library, post exchanges, post office, hospital, religious services, theaters, showers, Red Cross, and Army emergency relief. Recreation facilities included swimming, archery, tennis, a sports arena and a 9-hole golf course.\n\nWilliam Northern Field, an air training base, was an addition for war preparation. The field was used as a training site for crews of multi-engined B-24 Liberator bombers of the Army Air Force.\n\nCamp Forrest officially became a Prisoner of War Camp on May 12, 1942. The camp received, housed, secured, and administrated Italian, Japanese and German POWs. Prisoners were processed as laborers at Camp Forrest, the hospitals and in the local community on farms. In 1945 the US government implemented an Intellectual Diversion Program which would enlighten Germany on American way of life and increase their appreciation for the USA. This program used educational and recreational media to change views of POWs. The program was successful with many prisoners.\n\nTullahoma was greatly affected by the installation of Camp Forrest. Because of maneuvers and operations, civilians became accustomed to blocked roads, traffic jams, crowded stores, the absence of mail delivery, and driving at night without lights. Soldiers camped out on lawns and fields. Many crops and fences were destroyed. In 1940 the population in Tullahoma was 4,500. By the end of the war the population had grown to 75,000. Many military people who moved in for construction and operation of the camp remained after the war.\n\nAfter the war, 1946, Camp Forrest and Northern Field were declared surplus property. Buildings were sold at auction, torn down and carted away. Water, sewage and electrical systems were sold as salvage. All that remains are roads, brick chimneys and concrete foundations. Soon after the close of the camp, the area was selected for the site of an Air Engineering Development Center.\n\nIn 1949, Congress authorized $100 million for the construction of the Air Engineering Development Center. A site was selected for the new center at the Army's old Camp Forrest near Tullahoma and Manchester, Tennessee. The site was chosen for its abundance of land, water and power. Land was needed to buffer surrounding communities from potential test hazards and noise. Water was needed to cool rapidly flowing air and hot exhaust gases. Abundant electricity was needed to power huge testing systems. Construction on the center started in 1950. On June 25, 1951, a year after General Arnold’s death, President Harry S. Truman dedicated the Air Engineering Development Center in Arnold's honor, naming it the Arnold Engineering Development Center.\n\nOne of the government's early decisions concerning the center was to employ a primarily contractor work force. The Arnold Research Organization known as ARO was formed by Sverdrup and Parcel to become that contractor work force. Part of the rationale was to maintain a stable work force that came to accumulate a volume of experience with the test facilities that were to be built. That idea would make the center a model for outsourcing for the Department of Defense by the 1990s. The 1950s saw the development of three major test facilities that remain active today — the Engine Test Facility, the von Karman Gas Dynamics Facility and the Propulsion Wind Tunnel Test Facility.\n\nThe first jet engine test equipment installed at the center was acquired from the Bavarian Motor Works in Munich, Germany. It took 58 railroad cars and two barges with another 450 tons by truck to move the equipment. After refurbishment, this equipment became the cornerstone for the Engine Test Facility, which was completed in 1953. By May 1954, the facility was put to work, testing the General Electric J-47 engine for the B-47 Stratojet bomber.\n\nA flight dynamics facility for testing aerospace designs at high speeds was built and dedicated to Dr. Theodore von Karman in 1959. Operations began with a prototype test cell called E-1, which was used to test the Falcon guided missile. Construction was completed on the Propulsion Wind Tunnel Test Facility at the end of the decade. PWT's huge wind tunnels have become hallmarks of the center and are perhaps the most heavily used facilities on base.\n\nAs the space race intensified, so did AEDC's workload. PWT was used to investigate configurations for the Mercury space capsule. The center was a key player in supporting Project Gemini, and the center played a multi-faceted role in supporting the Apollo Program. Apollo tests included aerodynamic assessments of the Apollo capsule and tests of Saturn V rocket upper stage engines.\n\nSome new test facilities came on line to help turn numerous aerospace system ideas into reality. The J-4 Large Rocket Engine Test Facility was dedicated in 1964. PWT got an addition in 1968 when the Transonic Tunnel came on line, which is used largely to test store separations.\n\nWith several test facilities running at maximum, the pace of testing increased. Among the systems tested during the decade were the F-105 Thunderchief, C-141 Starlifter and C-5 Galaxy cargo planes, the E-3 Sentry, Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), the TF-39 engine for the C-5 and the upper-stage rocket motors for the Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. In the middle of the decade, the University of Tennessee and AEDC worked together in founding the University of Tennessee Space Institute. The institute became a place for AEDC engineers and scientists to further their education, and for students and professors to work on research projects to help AEDC.\n\nThere came a natural turndown in the pace of aerospace after the moon landing and the end of the Vietnam War. Despite the turndown and a corresponding reduction by the government in funding for AEDC and the number of its employees, the pace of testing held steady as nearly 3,000 test projects were completed in the decade.\n\nThe list of systems tested during the decade read like a who's who of aerospace. Included on that list were the Space Transportation System, which would later be called the Space Shuttle, the F-15 Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, B-1 Lancer bomber, A-10 Thunderbolt II, Pratt & Whitney F100 engine, MX missile, Sidewinder missile, Navy Tomahawk Cruise Missile, Air Force Air-Launched Cruise Missile and the Global Positioning Satellite.\n\nAEDC developed Laser-Illuminated Photography during the decade to better study projectiles in the center's ballistic Range G that would be traveling up to . The technique provided a photographic exposure equivalent to 20 billionths of a second.\n\nA heritage for environmental stewardship and uniqueness was born in 1976 when the Department of the Interior registered AEDC as a unique natural area. The honor recognized AEDC's superior management of fish and wildlife resources, conservation practices and environmental achievement.\n\nIn a decade when the nation became energy conscious, AEDC helped to explore alternative energy sources. A 750-ton magnet was used as part of a magnetohydrodynamics research demonstration at the center, sponsored by the Department of Energy. The demonstration assessed the effectiveness of using a large MHD generator to boost coal's efficiency in producing electricity. AEDC later transferred the project to the University of Tennessee Space Institute.\n\nThe conflict in the Persian Gulf at the beginning of the 1990s became a defining event in late 20th Century America. It also showed the world what AEDC had been doing in the 1980s. As people around the world watched from their living rooms, people saw the US score victories in Desert Storm. They also saw the end product of what AEDC people had been working on throughout the decade. From the Patriot Air Defense Missile to the F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter, AEDC people worked on every aerospace system deployed to the Persian Gulf. It was the first time technology showed up so dramatically in a real-world conflict, and it was a testament to the test and development work Arnold, von Karman and Wattendorf envisioned would be performed at AEDC.\n\nThe 1980s also marked the addition of the world's largest jet engine testing facility — the Aero-propulsion Systems Test Facility — to the center's aerospace flight simulation test facilities.\n\nFor the first time in the center's history, more than one major contractor performed work on base. The center's workload split into three contracts — support, propulsion testing and aerodynamics testing. In 1981, Pan Am World Services became the support contractor, Sverdrup Technology Inc. took over propulsion testing and Calspan Corp. began aerodynamics testing. In 1985, Schneider Services International replaced Pan Am as support contractor.\n\nThe 1990s were a decade of change at AEDC. From opening its doors to commercial customers to “reengineering,” the center's people explored better ways of doing business. Early in the decade, the center signed formal, long-term working alliances with several commercial aerospace organizations (Boeing, General Electric, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas, Pratt & Whitney) to steady the workload and to offset dwindling defense budgets. That led to companies like Pratt & Whitney and Boeing bringing projects that were strictly commercial to AEDC.\n\nAEDC leaders began to emphasize strategic management, meeting in focus groups to consider the long-term health of the center. An outgrowth was reengineering the center, an ongoing process that seeks to streamline operations and standardize maintenance processes. It was also a decade that saw the center break new ground on the computational front. Computational Fluid Dynamics, using computers to simulate flight, saw an increasing role in many major test programs. Using CFD and traditional ground testing together, helped hold down costs and provide more reliable data to test customers. In 1998, the center was designated as one of the Department of Defense's High-Performance Computing Centers, making funding available to augment the center's supercomputing capability making AEDC the 9th largest computer center in DoD.\nThe Navy docked at AEDC when its engine test facilities at Trenton NJ were transferred to AEDC as part of DoD consolidations under the Base Realignment and Closure Act. The move added four engine test facilities (SL-2, SL-3, T-11, T-12) and about 10 Navy personnel. The Air Force and Navy quickly integrated, making the center's vice commander and other slots Navy positions. Later in the decade, on Oct. 1, 1997, AEDC assumed management for the former Navy Hypervelocity Wind Tunnel 9 in White Oak, Md.\n\nOther facilities that came on line during the decade included J-6 — the world's largest solid rocket motor test facility — and DECADE, a nuclear weapons effects facility. Among facilities that saw significant modernization were the J-4 Liquid Rocket Engine Test Facility, the Aeropropulsion Test Unit and the Engine Test Facility. PWT also saw a major sustainment and modernization program begin. A number of major aerospace programs came to AEDC for testing, including the F-22 Raptor, the Joint Strike Fighter, the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, the Pratt & Whitney 4000 series engines for the Boeing 777 and F-119 engines for the F-22 and Joint Strike Fighter, the Boeing 747 and 767 and the RL-10 rocket engine.\n\nThe center's workload consolidated to two divisions — test and support — in the mid-1990s, with Sverdrup as test support contractor and ACS as center support contractor. ACS is a joint venture of Computer Sciences Corp., DynCorp and General Physics.\n\nIn Sept 2002 a $10.4 million test facility upgrade was announced. When completed, the upgrade would make Arnold Engineering Development Center a \"one-stop\" shopping center for aerodynamic and propulsion test customers by providing Mach 8 capability. The Mach 8 milestone, which equates to objects traveling about , comes as workers install a new high-temperature and high-pressure burner in the center's Aerodynamic and Propulsion Test Unit. This nearly doubles the center's current test capabilities of Mach 4.1 or nearly . AEDC test experts can run at Mach 8 for three to six minutes, which allows them to test an object across the full-duration mission profile. The project also calls for adding an improved air ejector system to allow the APTU to simulate higher altitude conditions while minimizing air usage. Installing the high-pressure air storage tanks and new liquid oxygen and isobutane systems are also included in the upgrade. Spring 2004 was the targeted completion date.\n\nArnold Air Force Base has its own post office with zip code, 37389.\n\n\n"}

He was born in Lebus, on the Oder River, and educated in Leipzig, Berlin, and Paris.\n\nEich made his first appearance in print with some poems in the \"Anthology of the Latest Poetry\". His first radio play, written in collaboration with Martin Raschke, was performed in 1929. From 1929–1932, Eich lived as a freelance writer in Dresden, Berlin, and on the Baltic coast, writing mainly for the radio. From 1939–1945, Eich served in the German army in a signals unit. In 1945 he was held as a war prisoner in an American internment camp, and in 1946 he was released and moved to Geisenhausen in Bavaria. After being held as a prisoner of war, he was one of the founders in 1947 of Gruppe 47, and for poems in his then unpublished \"Abgelegene Gehöfte\", he was one of the first two recipients, in 1950, of its Literature Prize for young writers. In 1953, he married the Jewish Austrian writer Ilse Aichinger. Their son Clemens was born on 22 May 1954, and their daughter Mirjam was born in 1958.\n\nHe continued to publish prose, poetry, and radio plays over the rest of his life. Eich died in Salzburg in 1972.\n\nEich was a contributor to \"Ana Victoria\", a literary magazine. \"Die Kolonne\" is seen as a reaction against contemporary Modernist literary trends, and rests on three central principles: \"the essential timelessness of the inner life, the notion of the genius as representative of his age, and the religious function of art.\" Eich believed in a fundamental incompatibility between poetry and politics and in his essay, \"Bemerkungen über Lyrik\", he drew a line between the poet \"als Lyriker\" and \"als Privatmann\" which allows poets to be politically active as long as it does not impinge on their work.\n\nEich is regarded as a literary conservative and his public association with a staunchly critical review of Johannes R. Becher's poem \"Der Große Plan\" attests to this. According to Cuomo, \"The most fitting overall characterisation of '[Die Kolonne]' would not be liberal or progressive, but conservative.\" \"Die Kolonne\" was strongly representative of Eich's own aesthetic and ideological views, and although largely apolitical, it appeared to favor conservative ideology. Despite this apparent conservatism, the journal aimed to separate literature from any political influence.\n\nThe majority of Eich's literary output in this period were radio plays, which numbered 160. The most well known of these today is \"Rebellion in der Goldstadt\", which was only recently discovered. The play was broadcast on 8 May 1940 in an anti-British radio campaign the Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry was waging. It deals with a South African mine and its workers striking against the poor wages they receive from the overtly capitalist British owner, Lord Pembroke. There is some contention surrounding Eich's complete authorship of the play as there is no broadcast text in his handwriting.\n\nOn 1 May 1933 Eich applied for membership in the Nazi Party but was not accepted.\n\nAfter the war, Eich made many public statements about the role of artists in standing up against oppressive regimes: \"If our work cannot be understood as criticism, as opposition and resistance, [...] then we are positive and decorate the slaughterhouse with geraniums.\" and \"\"Seid unbequem, seid Sand, nicht das Öl im Getriebe der Welt!\"\" which translates as \"Be inconvenient, be sand, not oil in the gears of the world!\"\n\nThese statements, however, stand in stark contrast to his actions during the Nazi era. His radio plays were often tailored to fit the propaganda needs of the Nazi party, extolling the \"Blut und Boden\" rural life and denouncing the decadent capitalism of the regime's enemies. It is believed that Eich had pragmatic reasons for writing all of his radio plays:\n\"Eichs Rundfunktätigkeit beschränkte sich auf den Hörspielbereich und diente dem Broterwerb. [...] Wie viele Hörspiele, Märchenbearbeitungen, Kalenderblätter Eich auch schrieb, niemals hat er damit «Karriere« gemacht.\"\nEich's broadcasting activity was limited to radio plays and breadwinning. Like many of the radio plays, fairy tale adaptation and calendar pages that Eich also wrote he never tried to 'make a career' out of it.\nHis collected works were published in four volumes in 1991.\n\nJames Dickey opened his 1965 poem \"The Firebombing,\" about a nighttime air raid on the Japanese town of Beppu, with this epigraph from Eich's work:\n\nroughly:\n\nEich received numerous literary prizes after World War II, including one from the literary association of which he was a member, Gruppe 47, in 1950. In 1953, he won the Hörspielpreis der Kriegsblinden for his radio play \"Die Andere und ich\" (\"The Other and I\"). Eich also won the Georg-Büchner-Preis in 1959 and the Schiller-Gedächtnispreis in 1968.\n\n"}

It is also sometimes referred to as the self-energy of the gauge boson (photon).\n\nAfter developments in radar equipment for World War II resulted in higher accuracy for measuring the energy levels of the hydrogen atom, I.I. Rabi made measurements of the Lamb shift and the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the electron. These effects corresponded to the deviation from the value −2 for the spectroscopic electron \"g\"-factor that are predicted by the Dirac equation. Later, Hans Bethe theoretically calculated those shifts in the hydrogen energy levels due to vacuum polarization on his return train ride from the Shelter Island Conference to Cornell.\n\nThe effects of vacuum polarization have been routinely observed experimentally since then as very well-understood background effects. Vacuum polarization referred to below as the one loop contribution occurs with leptons (electron–positron pairs) or quarks, the former (leptons) first observed in 1940s but also more recently observed in 1997 using the TRISTAN particle accelerator in Japan, the latter (quarks) along with multiple quark–gluon loop contributions from the early 1970s to mid-1990s using the VEPP-2M particle accelerator at the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics in Siberia in Russia and many other accelerator laboratories worldwide.\n\nVacuum polarization was first discussed in papers by P. A. M. Dirac and W. Heisenberg in 1934. Effects of vacuum polarization were calculated to first order in the coupling constant by R. Serber and E. A. Uehling in 1935.\n\nAccording to quantum field theory, the vacuum between interacting particles is not simply empty space. Rather, it contains short-lived virtual particle–antiparticle pairs (leptons or quarks and gluons). These short-lived pairs are called vacuum bubbles. It can be shown that they have no measurable impact on any process.\n\nVirtual particle–antiparticle pairs can also occur as a photon propagates. In this case, the effect on other processes \"is\" measurable. The one-loop contribution of a fermion–antifermion pair to the vacuum polarization is represented by the following diagram:\n\nThese particle–antiparticle pairs carry various kinds of charges, such as color charge if they are subject to QCD such as quarks or gluons, or the more familiar electromagnetic charge if they are electrically charged leptons or quarks, the most familiar charged lepton being the electron and since it is the lightest in mass, the most numerous due to the energy–time uncertainty principle as mentioned above; e.g., virtual electron–positron pairs. Such charged pairs act as an electric dipole. In the presence of an electric field, e.g., the electromagnetic field around an electron, these particle–antiparticle pairs reposition themselves, thus partially counteracting the field (a partial screening effect, a dielectric effect). The field therefore will be weaker than would be expected if the vacuum were completely empty. This reorientation of the short-lived particle–antiparticle pairs is referred to as \"vacuum polarization\".\n\nExtremely strong electric and magnetic fields cause an excitation of electron–positron pairs. Maxwell's equations are the classical limit of the quantum electrodynamics which cannot be described by any classical theory. A point charge must be modified at extremely small distances less than the reduced Compton wavelength formula_1 (formula_2). To lowest order in the fine-structure constant, formula_3, the QED result for the electrostatic potential of a point charge is:\n\nThis can be understood as a screening of a point charge by a medium with a dielectric permittivity, which is why the term vacuum polarization is used. When observed from distances much greater than formula_5, the charge is renormalized to the finite value formula_6. See also the Uehling potential.\n\nThe effects of vacuum polarization become significant when the external field approaches:\n\nThese effects break the linearity of Maxwell's equations and therefore break the superposition principle. The QED result for slowly varying fields can be written in non-linear relations for the vacuum. To lowest order formula_3, virtual pair production generates a vacuum polarization and magnetization given by:\n\nThe vacuum polarization is quantified by the vacuum polarization tensor Π(\"p\") which describes the dielectric effect as a function of the four-momentum \"p\" carried by the photon. Thus the vacuum polarization depends on the momentum transfer, or in other words, the electric constant is scale dependent. In particular, for electromagnetism we can write the fine-structure constant as an effective momentum-transfer-dependent quantity; to first order in the corrections, we have\n\nwhere Π(\"p\") = (\"p\" \"g\" − \"p\"\"p\") Π(\"p\") and the subscript 2 denotes the leading order-\"e\" correction. The tensor structure of Π(\"p\") is fixed by the Ward identity.\n\nVacuum polarization affecting spin interactions has also been reported based on experimental data and also treated theoretically in QCD, as for example in considering the hadron spin structure.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1942253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1942253", "title": "Sports radio", "text": "Sports radio\n\nSports radio (or sports talk radio) is a radio format devoted entirely to discussion and broadcasting of sporting events. A widespread programming genre that has a narrow audience appeal, sports radio is characterized by an often-boisterous on-air style and extensive debate and analysis by both hosts and callers. Many sports talk stations also carry play-by-play (live commentary) of local sports teams as part of their regular programming. Hosted by Bill Mazer, the first sports talk radio show in history launched in March 1964 on New York's WNBC (AM).\n\nSoon after WNBC launched its program, in 1965 Seton Hall University's radio station, WSOU, started \"Hall Line\", a call-in sports radio talk show focusing on the team's basketball program. Having celebrated its 50th anniversary on air during the 2015–2016 season, \"Hall Line\", which broadcasts to central and northern New Jersey as well as all five boroughs of New York, is the oldest and longest running sports talk call-in show in the NY-NJ Metropolitan area, and is believed to be the oldest in the nation.\n\nEnterprise Radio Network became the first national all-sports network, operating out of Avon, Connecticut, from New Year's Day 1981 through late September of that year before going out of business. ER had two channels, one for talk and a second for updates and play-by-play. ER's talk lineup included current New York Yankees voice John Sterling, New York Mets radio host Ed Coleman and former big-league pitcher Bill Denehy.\n\nSports talk is available in local, network and syndicated forms, is available in multiple languages, and is carried in multiple forms on both major North American satellite radio networks. In the United States, most sports talk-formatted radio stations air syndicated programming from ESPN Radio, SB Nation Radio, Sports Byline USA, Fox Sports Radio, CBS Sports Radio, or NBC Sports Radio, while in the Spanish language, ESPN Deportes Radio is the largest current network. In contrast, Canadian sports talk stations may carry a national brand (such as TSN Radio or Sportsnet Radio) but carry mostly local programming, with American-based shows filling in gaps. Compared to other formats, interactive \"talkback\" sports radio poses difficulties for Internet radio, since as a live format it is difficult to automate; most prominent sports leagues also place their radio broadcasts behind a paywall or provide their broadcasts directly to the consumer, depriving standalone Internet stations of potential programming. Pre-recorded sports talk programs (usually interview-centered) can be podcasted with relative ease, and sports teams have also launched their own online digital networks with sports talk centered around their own properties.\n\nAs with most other radio formats, sports radio uses dayparting. ESPN Radio, for instance, insists that its affiliates carry \"Mike and Mike in the Morning\" during morning drive time to provide as much national clearance as possible; in contrast, it carries less prominent programming in the afternoon drive to accommodate local sports talk, as well as in the evening (for its first two decades, rolling score updates aired under the banner of \"GameNight\") to allow stations to break away for local sporting events. Somewhat unusually for radio, the late-night and overnight hosts have more prominence on a sports talk network, due to a near-complete lack of local preemption; Sports Byline USA, for instance, \"only\" operates overnights.\n\nSports radio stations typically depend on drawing an audience that fits advertiser-friendly key demographics, particularly young men with the disposable income to invest in sports fandom, since the format does not have the broad appeal to reach a critical mass in the general public. Prominent sports radio stations typically get their greatest listenership from live play-by-play of local major professional sports league or college sports franchises; less prominent stations (especially on the AM dial) may not have this option because of poorer (or for daytime-only stations, non-existent) nighttime signals and smaller budgets for rights fees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n88.9 Brila FM: Sports Radio 88.9 Brila FM, owned by Brila Broadcasting Services, is Nigeria's first sports radio station and was launched in 2002.\n\nDZSR Sports Radio 918 kHz is the first and only sports radio station owned by the Philippine Broadcasting Service.\n\n\nIn 2009, Detroit's \"97.1 The Ticket\" WXYT-FM, thanks to the surprising time slot dominance of shows like \"Valenti and Foster\", in addition to holding the play-by-play rights for the Detroit Tigers, Detroit Red Wings, Detroit Lions and the Detroit Pistons, became the USA's only sports talk radio station to be the highest rated station in their market, according to Portable People Meter rankings. The station relocated to the FM dial in October 2007 after existing on the AM dial for seven years prior, replacing a Free FM \"hot talk\" station, WKRK. This ratings success has led to WXYT-FM billing itself as the country's best sports station.\n\nWXYT-FM's recent influence has led to CBS Radio installing sports radio stations on the FM dial in Dallas (105.3 The Fan), Boston (98.5 The Sports Hub), Pittsburgh (93.7 The Fan), Washington, DC (106.7 The Fan), Baltimore (105.7 The Fan) and Cleveland (92.3 The Fan), in addition to simulcasting Philadelphia's heritage 610 WIP onto the former WYSP. Other non-CBS stations have also migrated to the FM dial, most notably Clear Channel's KFAN in Minneapolis, Greater Media's WPEN in Pennsylvania and Dispatch Media's WBNS-FM in Columbus, just to name a few.\n\nMore recently, a number large number of listeners have begun to make internet radio the primary medium of choice. Major market leaders such as ESPN, NBC, CBS, Yahoo, and Fox have invested in the creation of their own proprietary sports apps for streaming radio distribution on Apple, Android, and Windows devices. Other independent market leaders such as Sports Radio America choose to stream their content through non proprietary apps including Live 365 and Tune In.\n\nSortable lists of commercial sports talk radio stations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1942258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1942258", "title": "Table wine", "text": "Table wine\n\nTable wine is a wine term with two different meanings: a style of wine and a quality level within wine classification.\n\nIn the United States, \"table wine\" primarily designates a wine style: ordinary wine which is neither fortified nor sparkling nor expensive.\n\nIn the European Union wine regulations, \"table wine\" (TW) is the lower of two overall quality categories, the higher of which is \"Quality Wines Produced in Specified Regions\" (QWPSR). All levels of national wine classification systems within the EU correspond to either TW or the QWPSR, although the terms that actually appear on wine labels are defined by national wine laws with the EU regulations as a framework.\n\nMost EU countries have a national classification called \"table wine\" in the country's official language. Examples include \"vin de table\" in France, \"vino da tavola\" in Italy, \"vino de mesa\" in Spain, \"vinho de mesa\" in Portugal, \"Tafelwein\" in Germany, \"επιτραπέζιος οίνος\" (\"epitrapézios oínos\") in Greece. These classifications generally represent the lowest level of classification in their country.\n\nThe Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau and Code of Federal Regulations define table wine as grape wine having an alcoholic strength of maximum 14 percent alcohol by volume. Wines between 14% and 24% ABV are known as dessert wine. Table wine may also be designated using terms such as light wine, light white wine, red table wine, or sweet table wine.\n\nEuropean Union guidelines stipulate that all wine produced must fall into one of two categories: \"table wine\" or the superior \"Quality Wines Produced in Specified Regions\" (often referred to as \"Quality wine p.s.r.\"). Within the category of table wines, a difference is made between \"plain\" table wines, which are only allowed to display the country of origin, and \"table wines with geographical indication\", which may indicate a region of origin and are a form of Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) applied to wine.\n\nFor the lowest \"vin de table\" level in France, the producers must use postal codes to prevent the name of an appellation from appearing even in fine print on the label or its vintage date (though \"lot numbers\" which can bear a striking resemblance to dates are permitted). The new appellation Vin de France permits a vintage date.\n\nThe following national levels of wine classification correspond to table wines and table wines with geographical indication.\n\nThe fraction of national production classified as table wine varies dramatically from country to country. As of 2000, in France, a majority (by volume) of wine is \"vin de table\", while in Germany only 5% is \"deutscher Tafelwein\". Table wine from anywhere in the EU can be blended together to produce European Table Wine.\n\nEuropean table wines are generally made from the highest-yielding sites and vinified in an industrial manner. In the 1950s, when per capita consumption of wine was much higher, there was a need for vast quantities of cheap wine, but now much of it goes into the European Union's troublesome \"wine lake.\" Even today it is possible in France or Spain to purchase a litre of thin, pale wine, packaged in a box rather than a bottle, for the equivalent of a couple of U.S. dollars.\n\nIn contradiction to the presumed order, exceptional table wines are uncommon in Europe, but do exist. Ambitious wine-making outcomes may be classified as mere \"table wine\" if they are made from non-traditional grapes or with unconventional wine making processes. Even wines made with every measure of care (such as low vine yields and hand harvesting) and grown on sites otherwise entitled to a prestigious appellation may be denied status.\n\nThe best-known examples are the wines called Super Tuscans, which are made either with more than allowed quantities of international varieties (grapes not indigenous to Italy such as Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon) or without the once mandated inclusion of small proportions of Canaiolo, Malvasia and Trebbiano per the relevant Tuscan appellation (i.e. Montevertine's Pergole Torte).\n\nIn 1992, Italy created the Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT) specifically to permit Super Tuscans to leave the table wine classification and become quality wine. Still, wherever legitimacy in a given appellation is stipulated by something more than a geographic boundary, one may find producers willing to ignore limitations in pursuit of extreme quality.\n\nIn common usage \"vin de table\" is the fourth and lowest ranked wine under the French wine classification. These wines are the cheapest to buy and to make (they can be bought from €.80), and are generally drunk accompanying a midday meal or used to make wine-based cocktails.\n\n"}

{"id": "1942268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1942268", "title": "More Cowbell", "text": "More Cowbell\n\n\"More Cowbell\" is a comedy sketch that aired on \"Saturday Night Live\" on April 8, 2000. The sketch is presented as an episode of VH1's documentary series \"Behind the Music\" that fictionalizes the recording of the song \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\" by Blue Öyster Cult. The sketch featured guest host Christopher Walken as music producer \"\"The\" Bruce Dickinson\", and regular cast member Will Ferrell, who wrote the sketch with playwright Donnell Campbell, as fictional cowbell player Gene Frenkle, whose overzealous playing annoys his bandmates but pleases producer Dickinson. The sketch also starred Chris Parnell as Eric Bloom, Jimmy Fallon as Albert Bouchard, Chris Kattan as Buck Dharma and Horatio Sanz as Joe Bouchard.\n\nThe sketch is often considered one of the greatest \"SNL\" sketches ever made, and in many \"best of\" lists regarding \"SNL\" sketches, it is often placed in the top ten, being ranked number nine by \"Rolling Stone.\" As a result of its popularity, \"more cowbell\" became an American pop culture catchphrase.\n\nAn episode of VH1's \"Behind the Music\" documenting the band Blue Öyster Cult showcases footage of the group from a 1976 recording session that produced the band's biggest hit, \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper.\" The producer (played by Christopher Walken) introduces himself as \"\"The\" Bruce Dickinson\" and tells the band they have \"what appears to be a dynamite sound\". The first take seems to go well but the band stops playing because the cowbell part is rather loud and distracting. Dickinson, to the surprise of most of the band, asks for \"a little more cowbell\" and suggests that the cowbell player, Gene Frenkle (Will Ferrell), \"really explore the studio space this time\". Frenkle's exuberance in following this advice causes him to bump into his bandmates as he dances around the cramped studio, thrusting his pelvis wildly in all directions, and the band aborts another take.\n\nFrenkle sheepishly agrees to tone down his performance in the spirit of cooperation. He passive-aggressively plays the cowbell very close to Eric Bloom (Chris Parnell)'s ear and fails to keep time with the rest of the band. The rest of the band expresses frustration with Frenkle, but Dickinson remains focused only on getting more cowbell onto the track. Frenkle makes an impromptu speech to the rest of the band, declaring that Dickinson's stature lends a great deal of weight to his opinion about the cowbell part and that the last time he (Frenkle) checked, they didn't have \"a whole lot of songs that feature the cowbell\" and therefore he would be \"doing himself a disservice, and every member of the band\" if he \"didn't perform the hell out of this\". In the end, the band agrees to let Frenkle play the cowbell part his way. The sketch ends with a freeze frame on Frenkle with the superimposed message: \"In Memoriam: Gene Frenkle: 1950–2000.\"\n\n\nWill Ferrell's idea for the sketch came from hearing \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\" over the years: \"Every time I heard [the song], I would hear the faint cowbell in the background and wonder, 'What is that guy's life like? He co-wrote the sketch with friend and playwright Donnell Campbell. Ferrell first submitted it for the episode with Norm Macdonald as host, which aired on October 23, 1999. \"SNL\" creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels was unsure about the premise, though the sketch played well among crew at the table read. According to Seth Meyers, who served as head writer several seasons later, the sketch was submitted over seven times before making the show. Ferrell re-wrote the sketch when Christopher Walken was scheduled to host to fit the actor's rhythm. The sketch was put near the end of the episode, where more offbeat/odd sketches often air.\n\nThe actors who appeared in the sketch had trouble keeping straight faces. They found Ferrell's acting, along with Walken's stone-faced performance, so funny that they were all on the verge of breaking up laughing and ruining the sketch several times. On \"Take Two,\" Walken can be seen through the booth glass, laughing, as Ferrell's too-tight shirt rides up, exposing Ferrell's stomach while he is dancing and playing the cowbell. Even Ferrell at one point can be seen laughing for a moment soon after Jimmy Fallon laughs for the first time in the sketch. According to Fallon, Ferrell wore a tighter shirt in the live sketch than he wore at dress rehearsal to allow his stomach to hang out, in turn making Fallon laugh.\n\nWhile the song \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\" by Blue Öyster Cult does indeed feature a cowbell playing throughout the song, its sound is largely drowned out by the rest of the instruments. According to Donald \"Buck Dharma\" Roeser, the lead singer and author-composer of the song, the sketch accurately portrays the band's look during the 1970s, but it inaccurately portrays some of the details of the actual recording:\n\n\nThe sketch's offbeat nature, as well as the actors breaking character, made the sketch an immediate fan favorite. Marc Spitz called it \"one of the first super-memes of the new century\" in \"the New York Times.\" Walken continued to hear from fans about the sketch in years afterward: \"I hear about it everywhere I go. It's been YEARS, and all anybody brings up is 'COW-bell.' I guess you never know what's gonna click.\" Ferrell even speculates that it \"ruined\" Walken's life.\n\nMembers of Blue Öyster Cult were positive regarding the sketch. Though the song was previously well known for its creepy tone, co-vocalist Buck Dharma said that \"Ferrell pretty much sabotaged that.\"\n\nThe sketch was referenced on various episodes of \"SNL\" in years to come. On May 14, 2005, on an episode that Will Ferrell hosted, the Gene Frenkle character made a reappearance on the set of \"Saturday Night Live\" as musical guest Queens of the Stone Age played their first song of the night, \"Little Sister\" – which features a jam block, an instrument similar to a cowbell. In his Gene Frenkle costume, Ferrell played the song's jam block part using a large cowbell along with the band, drawing much applause. Promotions for the April 5, 2008 Christopher Walken/Panic! at the Disco episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" referenced the \"More Cowbell\" sketch. The cowbell did not appear during the actual episode. At the end of the May 16, 2009 Will Ferrell/Green Day episode, Green Day performed \"East Jesus Nowhere\" with Ferrell on the cowbell. Ferrell's appearance was unrehearsed and it was unknown to Green Day that Ferrell would appear. Additionally, Ferrell was unfamiliar with the song and not aware of the sound-break near its end. As the sound-break continued, Ferrell elaborately played single \"final\" cowbell beats, expecting the lights to fade, then began to leave the stage. Lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong called him back, saying, \"Wait, goddamn it!\" and began his vocal. Ferrell came to the microphone and asked, \"Wait, is this song still going on?\" Laughing, Armstrong answered, \"Yes.\"\n\nFerrell guest-starred on the final episode of \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\", playing cowbell in reference to the sketch. Ferrell appeared in the 2011 video for \"Make Some Noise\" by the Beastie Boys, in the front of a limo, playing a cowbell. Ferrell and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith (with whom Ferrell is often said to bear resemblance) appeared on the May 22, 2014 episode of \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" for a charity drum-off battle. Despite Smith clearly giving the better performance, Ferrell was named the winner and awarded a giant gold cowbell after Ferrell, realizing he could not outplay Smith, pulled out a cowbell after the latter's third solo, whereupon both were joined by Smith's Chili Peppers bandmates for a performance of \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\" with Ferrell playing cowbell.\n\nAt Ferrell's all-star cancer benefit concert Best Night of Your Life on October 6, 2018, Ferrell joined Coldplay's Chris Martin on cowbell for the song \"Viva la Vida.\"\n\nIn St. Charles, Missouri, a marathon/half marathon race is held annually called MO’ Cowbell Run. The race name was inspired by the \"SNL\" sketch.\n\nAt Washington State University during their historic NCAA basketball tournament runs in 2007-2008, coached by Tony Bennett, power forward Robbie Cowgill prompted student section chants of \"I've got a fever and the only prescription is more Cowgill.\" Los Angeles Angels and New York Mets outfielder Collin Cowgill was the subject of similar fan jokes.\n\nFerrell claimed in 2019 that this \"More Cowbell\" sketch \"ruined\" Walken's life because Walken is best known by the general public for his role in this sketch.\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 electric car features an “Easter Egg” that shows the cowbell on the screen. If the driver pushes down the gear shifter 4 times in quick succession, it starts cowbell mode, which plays a long audio clip of the sketch and shows a rainbow trail on the touchscreen following the car.\n\nIn The Lord of the Rings Online MMORPG, there is an item that can be used for music generation called the \"Moor Cowbell\".\n\n"}

It is the current home ground of the Essendon Cricket Club in the Victorian Premier Cricket, and the Essendon reserves in the Victorian Football League.\n\nIn the 1880s, the Essendon Recreation Reserve became the primary multi-purpose grassed sports reserve in Essendon. The Essendon Cricket Club was the ground manager and primary tenant, and played its cricket matches there during the summer. The Essendon Bowls Club was granted permissive occupancy of the south-western corner of the reserve in 1886. The reserve also contained a bicycle track, and was used by the Essendon District Football Club, which was a junior club, for its home games during the winter. At this stage, the Essendon Football Club, which was playing top-level senior football in the Victorian Football Association, played only occasional games at the venue; its primary home ground was the East Melbourne Cricket Ground approximately six miles away.\n\nThe demise of the Essendon District Football Club in 1897 left the ground vacant for other sports during the next three winters, including running and lacrosse. Football returned to the ground in 1900 with the establishment of the Essendon Town Football Club, which played in the Victorian Football Association. Over the following few years, the Essendon Croquet Club was established, and it built a court and club room in the north-eastern corner of the reserve.\n\nIn 1921, the East Melbourne Cricket Ground was closed, which forced the Essendon Football Club (at that time playing in the Victorian Football League) to find a new home. The council wanted the club to move to the Essendon Recreation Reserve, and committed to making £12,000 of improvements to the venue if the club did make the move, but the club thought it would have a better outcome if it moved to the Arden Street Oval in North Melbourne. Ultimately, Essendon's move to North Melbourne was blocked by the state government, after a protest from the VFA which did not want to lose access to the Arden Street Oval, so Essendon moved to the Essendon Recreation Reserve. The Essendon Town club disbanded as a result of losing its home ground.\n\nAfter this move, Essendon used the venue as its home ground for VFL/AFL matches for the next seventy years, from 1922 until 1991. Essendon played 628 matches at the venue, with a win-loss record of 418–201-9, a winning percentage of 67.28%. The venue also hosted one neutral VFL match: a finals match between South Melbourne and Richmond during the 1924 VFL finals series. The record attendance was 43,487 for a match between Essendon and in 1966.\n\nThe nickname \"Windy Hill\" for the ground was popularised in the mid-1950s by Lou Richards. Richards, a former Collingwood captain but by then a football columnist for \"The Sun News-Pictorial\" wrote his reviews in an expansive and humorous writing style, and coined the term because of the ground's windy reputation. The nickname stuck and is in near-universal use to describe the ground – and often by association the Essendon Football Club itself.\n\nIn 1992, after a poll of members, the Essendon Football Club moved its home ground for matches from Windy Hill to the Melbourne Cricket Ground, but it retained Windy Hill as its training, administrative and social base. Over that time, the Essendon Cricket Club continued to use the venue for premier cricket matches in summer, and by the 2010/11 summer, Windy Hill was the last remaining venue still shared between an AFL club and a premier cricket club. Over time, some of the grandstands were demolished and some of the outer reclaimed.\n\nIn 2010, the Essendon Football Club sought an upgrade to its training facilities, and it elected to develop and entirely new facility in the suburb of Melbourne Airport. A major contributing factor was that the development at the new venue was not limited by size constraints which would have limited a redevelopment of Windy Hill; the club was also at the time in a well publicised dispute with the Essendon Bowls Club, which was still the ground manager of its portion of Windy Hill and was unwilling to cede its territory to the football club's redevelopment, but the football club indicated that it would have made the move to Melbourne Airport regardless of the bowls club's position. Essendon signed a 37-year lease at Melbourne Airport, and moved its primary training and administrative base to the facility in October 2013. Essendon still holds a lease at Windy Hill which will expire after 2031; the club uses the venue for home matches for its reserves team in the Victorian Football League, and maintains a social club and merchandise store on the site.\n\nThe venue currently has three grandstands:\n\nFormer stands and features included:\n\nDuring the days as Essendon's home ground, Windy Hill had the reputation of being a violent place for players, and was the site of several ugly incidents, The most famous of these was the \"Battle of Windy Hill\", when a brawl broke out between players, team officials, trainers, spectators and police at half-time during a match between Essendon and Richmond on 18 May 1974. Another famous incident is when Hawthorn player Leigh Matthews broke the behind post after running into it during play in a 1982 game.\n\nThe dimensions of the grassed surface of the arena are long and wide (the playing field is slightly smaller after the boundary lines are marked). The long axis of the ground runs east-west.\n\nThe Windy Hill Fitness Centre is a multipurpose aquatic facility and health club in Essendon, Victoria. The facility consists of an indoor 25m pool, spa, toddler play area, sauna, health club, group fitness studio, crèche, wellness studio, cycle/spin studio and personal training studio.\n\nThe facility was built by the Essendon Football Club for use by both the community and its players in 1995. The health club was originally built inside the old Showers Grand Stand which formed part of the Windy Hill Football Ground.\n\nThe health club was renovated in 2007 as part of a redevelopment by the Football Club with the Shower Grand Stand demolished, and the new gym built next to where the Essendon Bowls Club once had a third green.\n\nThe centre is currently managed for the Football Club by Belgravia Leisure.\n\n"}

The Flora of China also counts Europe as the area of distribution. The sites include grasslands as well as sparse forests.\n\nIt is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant, both in China and elsewhere across temperate regions of the world; numerous cultivars have been selected for garden use. Over the years, many forms have been derived from selection and hybridization. Today, the efforts of breeders are aimed at creating hybrids characterized by a compact bush, early and long flowering, flowers of various shades. This makes it possible to grow plants not only at the amateur level, but also for commercial purposes.\n"}
{"id": "1942294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1942294", "title": "Rockingham Speedway", "text": "Rockingham Speedway\n\nRockingham Speedway, formerly North Carolina Motor Speedway and later North Carolina Speedway is a racetrack located near Rockingham, North Carolina. It is also known as the Rock and previously hosted NASCAR Cup Series, NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series, ARCA, CARS Tour, and UARA-Stars races. \n\nThe track opened as a flat, one-mile oval on October 31, 1965. In 1969, the track was extensively reconfigured to a high-banked, D-shaped oval just over one mile in length. In 1997, North Carolina Motor Speedway merged with Penske Motorsports, and was renamed \"North Carolina Speedway\". Shortly thereafter, the infield was reconfigured, and competition on the infield road course, mostly by the SCCA, was discontinued. Until 2013, it was home to the Fast Track High Performance Driving School, The track was used often for television and movie filming. Currently, The Rock is undergoing renovations and updates by the current ownership in order to house large-scale racing events and festivals.\n\nRockingham Speedway, then known as North Carolina Motor Speedway, was the project of Harold Brasington and Bill Land. Brasington, a land developer, also built NASCAR's first superspeedway, Darlington Raceway, in 1950. Land owned the property, which is settled in the sandhills of North Carolina, and together, they set out to find funding. They went to local lawyer Elsie Webb who assembled a group of backers. The duo also sold shares to the locals for $1 per share, and at one time had about 1,000 shareholders.\n\nThe speedway was built as a one-mile oval with flat turns. North Carolina Motor Speedway opened on October 31, 1965, holding its first race on the same day. The American 500 was a 500-lap, 500-mile NASCAR Grand National Series race won by Curtis Turner at an average speed of 101.942 miles per hour. Turner dominated the race, which was attended by 35,000 people, leading 239 laps and winning by 11 seconds. The winner's purse was $13,090. The American 500 was the 54th of 55 races in the 1965 season, which included NASCAR legends Cale Yarborough (who finished second), Richard Petty, Ned Jarrett (who would go on to win the championship), Buddy Baker, David Pearson, and Junior Johnson. Only 19 of the 43 cars were running at the end of the race.\n\nThe speedway held two Grand National races the next year, the Peach Blossom 500, and the American 500. The Peach Blossom 500 would change names multiple times, usually using the name Carolina 500, before ending as the Subway 400. The American 500 would also change names multiple times as well, ending as the Pop Secret Microwave Popcorn 400. The first race was typically held in early March or late February, and the second race was held in late October. In 1967 and 1968 the Carolina 500 was run in June. The speedway held two Grand National Series races every year until 2004.\n\nAs part of the acquisition of the Penske Speedways in 1999, the Speedway was sold to International Speedway Corporation (ISC) and in 2004, one of its two Cup races (the crucial fall race, often the penultimate date on the schedule) was transferred to ISC's California Speedway. The change was made after sagging attendance at Rockingham Speedway. It left the track with only one date, in late February, a highly unpopular date for spectators due to the commonly unpredictable weather. That date was moved up from the traditional early spring date in 1992 when Richmond International Raceway wanted a later date than the traditional post-Daytona date because of two postponements in the late 1980s caused by snow. Rumors persisted that the track's lone remaining date was also in jeopardy, as several new tracks in larger, warm-weather markets coveted the date, which was the first race following the Daytona 500, and in 2002 and 2004, Fox's first race of the season.\n\nDespite wide speculation that the race was in its final year, it failed to sell out, falling nearly 10,000 short of the 60,000 capacity. The track indeed hosted its final race, the Subway 400, on February 22, 2004. In that last race, Matt Kenseth held off rookie Kasey Kahne on the last lap to win by only 0.010 seconds. This finish was one of the closest in NASCAR history, and is viewed by many fans as one of the best finishes that season. It is also known for a wild crash early in the race in which Carl Long flipped wildly down the backstretch.\n\nIn the wake of the Ferko lawsuit (in which a shareholder sued NASCAR, alleging a failed promise to schedule a race to a competing track), and the poor attendance, the track's state of affairs was sharply altered. In the settlement, ISC sold Rockingham Speedway to Speedway Motorsports (SMI), and the track's lone remaining race was \"transferred\" to Texas Motor Speedway. Some NASCAR fans saw things differently, however, because it was Darlington Raceway's prestigious Southern 500 removed from the schedule for the second race in Texas, and the date for the Rock was sent to Phoenix International Raceway. SMI agreed to host no NASCAR events at the track while it was under their ownership. Upon its exit from the NASCAR circuit, the Rock joined such facilities as Ontario Motor Speedway, Riverside International Raceway, North Wilkesboro Speedway, Texas World Speedway, and Music City Motorplex as tracks removed from the circuit.\n\nThe Rockingham track was often praised for good racing, including 37 official lead changes in one race in 1981, and for having great sightlines for spectators. However, the facility made limited infrastructure reinvestments over the years while being owned by the DeWitt family, and seemed to lag behind other facilities which continually modernized and updated their business plans, especially after it was sold to pay off estate taxes owed by the DeWitt and Wilson families which had owned the track.\n\nSpeedway Motorsports put the track up for auction on October 2, 2007.\n\nARCA RE/MAX Series Series car owner and former driver Andy Hillenburg, who owns Fast Track High Performance Driving School, paid $4.4 million for the track. Just hours after closing the deal for the sale, he called some sanctioning bodies to arrange dates for his new circuit.\n\nA 500-kilometer ARCA RE/MAX Series race took place during the weekend of May 3–4, 2008, featuring two rounds of qualifying and practice on Saturday and the Carolina 500 on Sunday. It was the richest race on the 2008 ARCA schedule and featured a starting field of fifty cars. Up and coming NASCAR star Joey Logano won the race at 17 years 346 days, the youngest to win a major race at the track, by passing Ken Schrader, who was making his 53rd start (39 NSCS, 13 NNS) at the track, after a caution. Logano dominated the 500-kilometer affair, winning the pole, leading the most laps, and passing Schrader with five laps remaining to win the track's return to major racing with Bill Venturini's Chevrolet. The 500k distance was not held again for ARCA, as ARCA had a pair of races in 2009 at the track. Rockingham lost one race in 2010, but will still hold the season ending American 200. For 2011, ARCA left and was replaced by the UARA and CARS series for the two races.\n\nThe road course has been restored, and in December 2007, testing on the road course commenced. The road course's first week of racing was on January 5–6, 2008, featuring Legends Cars, Bandolero, and Thunder Roadsters.\n\nA 150-lap street stock race, the Polar Bear 150, was held on January 1, 2009, and the event has since become an annual race. Street stock is generally the entry-level class of racing at most short tracks. Dale Earnhardt Jr. entered a pair of cars for the race, one for his car chief at Hendrick Motorsports and another for an Earnhardt Ganassi Racing mechanic who decided to race in the event. His brother-in-law, Jimmy Elledge (crew chief for Scott Speed in the Sprint Cup) also drove in the race. The race was moved for the 2010-11 offseason to Thanksgiving weekend, and in November 2010, Kurt Busch drove in the street stock race, debuting his new number (#22). The Frank Kimmel Street Stocks did not race the Polar Bear 150 in 2012.\n\nStarting in 2008, Rockingham has held the ARCA Racing Series presented by RE/MAX and Menards season ending race, dubbed the American 200. This has been the premier event at Rockingham since its reopening. In 2009 Rockingham held an additional ARCA race, however that race was not held in 2010. Rockingham also holds the Carolina 200, the finale for the CARS Pro Cup Series. In addition to these events, Rockingham will also have Chumpcar World Series, Legends and Bandolero racing.\n\nOn September 7, 2011, it was announced that Rockingham would hold its inaugural Good Sam Roadside Assistance 200 on April 15, 2012, the first Camping World Truck Series race held at the track since the series inception. The announcement made by track owner Andy Hillenburg and North Carolina governor Bev Perdue, who said that the track would help the local economy by about $7.2–$10.5 million (2011 USD). Wayne Auton, the Truck Series director, announced that NASCAR testing would end on December 31, 2011 on the main track, but would remain on the half-mile facility.\n\nOn January 30, 2012, it was announced that the second annual Carolina Rebellion festival would be held at the Rockingham Speedway.\n\nKasey Kahne, who had been beaten at the line by Matt Kenseth in the final Cup race at the track, avenged the defeat with a win at the Good Sam Roadside Assistance 200, after Turner Motorsports teammate Nelson Piquet, Jr. scored the pole and dominated the race, only to lose his chance at winning through a late-race speeding penalty on the last pit stop.\n\nIn 2014, the Truck Series did not return to the track due to financial struggles. In September it was reported that Farmers & Merchants Bank was requesting a court order to take \"immediate and exclusive custody\" of the speedway from co-owners Hillenburg and Bill Silas, who were reported to owe $4.5 million to the bank.\n\nOn August 16, 2011 it was announced that Rockingham would install SAFER barrier along the track walls to improve driver safety. However, rumors spread of the track possibly getting a date on the 2012 Camping World Truck Series schedule. On September 2, an announcement was made by ESPN that Rockingham would receive a Truck Series race scheduled for April 2012 and a press conference would be held on September 7 with Andy Hillenburg and North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue to announce plans. The press conference on September 7 confirmed that the race would be called the \"Good Sam Roadside Assistance 200\" and be held on April 15. Wayne Auton, the director of the Truck Series, confirmed that teams can still test at Rockingham until December 31. However, testing on the .526-mile oval would remain legal.\nOn November 22, 2011, the track announced that the track will be getting a NASCAR K&N Pro Series East and Whelen Southern Modified Tour dates along with the UARA Stars Late Model Series race on November 3, 2012. At the 2012 NASCAR Truck race at Rockingham, Kasey Kahne went on to win his first Rockingham race.\n\nNASCAR removed the Whelen Southern Modified Tour because of track compatibility issues (cars were going too fast on the track even with a restrictor plate, as the track is faster even than the New Hampshire Motor Speedway, the fastest oval used by either Whelen Modified Tour, which results in a restrictor plate being used). The K&N Pro East and UARA Late Model races will be joined by the Frank Kimmel Street Stock Series race (with plates) instead, for the Richard Childress Racing \"Classic 3\" Championship Weekend.\n\nIn 2016, Level 1 Motorsports announced the creation of the X-Cup Series, which expressed plans to run a ten-race schedule at the track, two of which would be run on the infield road course. This turned out to be a scam and it ripped off both car owners, Driver and the Veterans Group they claimed to support. However, the track was foreclosed on in July 2015 because of outstanding debt that Andy Hillenburg had accumulated after his purchase of the speedway . On May 16, 2016, BK Rock Holdings purchased Rockingham Speedway at a Richmond County Courthouse auction for . \n\nOn August 30, 2018 a group of North Carolina investors named Rockingham Properties LLC. completed the purchase of the track. New ownership announced four days later that racing would be returning to the track in some form in the near future. In his 2019-2021 budget recommendation, North Carolina governor Roy Cooper proposed $8 million of state money to renovate the facility, which would be renamed \"The Rock Speedway and Entertainment Complex\".\n\nRockingham became in the mid-to-late 2000s a test track for many Monster Energy Cup and Xfinity Series teams because of testing restrictions by NASCAR on active tracks. After the track was stripped of its dates, teams began using the circuit to test cars and engines, especially to simulate abrasive wear at certain tracks (Darlington and Atlanta most notably). The track surface is more abrasive than other tracks, due to the high sand content of paving compounds made from local materials. This abrasiveness contributes to excessive tire wear. In 2005, Kyle Petty tested his Darlington car at Rockingham days before its race to not waste one of his five assigned tests.\n\nIn 2006, new rules banned all testing at active Sprint Cup tracks except at selected NASCAR-approved open tests during the season, thereby making testing at Rockingham crucial. Penske Racing tested at the track in mid-April 2006, and with the abrasiveness of the Atlanta Motor Speedway surface, which has not been repaved since reconstruction in 1997, and Atlanta's participation in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, many teams are considering returning to Rockingham in September or October to test their cars to simulate Atlanta's similar surface.\n\nNASCAR's new Car of Tomorrow (or COT) has led to a boom in testing at the track, and many teams used the track for testing the new cars when it was announced the car would be used in 2007.\n\nIn the runup to the COT's debut, Michael Waltrip Racing, Gillett Evernham Motorsports, Yates Racing, and Roush Fenway Racing tested their COT's at the track.\n\nElliott Sadler was asked about testing the Car of Tomorrow at Phoenix International Raceway the day after the 2006 Checker Auto Parts 500.\n\nNo, I'm going to Rockingham on Wednesday to test the (Car of Tomorrow). We wanted to go to a very bumpy racetrack. The car slams down on the banking very hard at Rockingham and make sure we've got all the springs and all the bumps very smooth feeling. That'll be my first time in the COT. I'm pretty anxious and looking forward to it. NASCAR fans, and we're all fans in this garage, don't like change. We're just skeptical of it, and we've had some really good racing this year, some of the best racing we've had in a while. We're just starting to learn how to get our cars better with the short spoilers. Nobody really wants to change, but how can you complain or argue with NASCAR? They've done such a good job the past 10 years of growing our sport and making it more fan friendly and appealing to TV and things like that. If they think this is going to help our sport grow, we've got to get in there whether we think it's right or wrong and do it with them.\n\nGreg Biffle said during the 2007 NASCAR Jackson Hewitt Preseason Thunder press conference, \"Pat (Tryson, crew chief, who was subsequently released and joined Penske Racing) and I are going to Rockingham (January 18) with a COT to try to learn some things about them, bump stops and all of the things that are new on them, you know, because we are going to race them at Darlington. But those are going to be keys to making the Chase is running well with that COT car and getting our downforce cars to handle good.\"\n\nTesting at Rockingham has become a premium because of NASCAR's rules limiting testing imposed since 2006 to the NASCAR-sanctioned open tests. NASCAR rules state testing at tracks not on the series in question is not controlled by the sanctioning body, and many teams evade the testing ban at such tests, which also include the Greenville-Pickens Speedway and Concord Motorsports Park (short tracks), and the Kentucky Speedway (Sprint Cup tests only). Testing at Rockingham is restricted to series that do not run at the circuit (NASCAR mostly), while restrictions to ARCA and CARS-sanctioned open testing apply in those two series because Rockingham is on both series' schedules in 2008. For NASCAR teams, the track has become one of the most popular tracks to test shorter to intermediate tracks on the circuit.\n\nFor the 2009 season, NASCAR imposed a blanket ban on testing at any track used by any of NASCAR's three national series or its Camping World touring events. Rockingham, unlike many tracks used in testing historically, is not on any of the series in question, and teams will use both tracks to run around NASCAR's testing ban.\n\nA new track, dubbed the Little Rock, was built behind the backstretch for other classes of short-track cars and for the Fast Track driving school Hillenburg owns, and opened October 13, 2008. NASCAR Sprint Cup teams immediately christened the track for testing in preparation for the TUMS QuikPak 500 at Martinsville Speedway that ensuing weekend, as \"Little Rock\" is designed similar to Martinsville, yet the lap length is the same, with 800' straights, 588' turns, and the inside lanes of the turns are concrete. Unlike the oval, which will be restricted to NASCAR testing on January 1, 2012, NASCAR testing will remain unrestricted on the Little Rock.\n\nThe half-mile oval is unique in that instead of a traditional guardrail around the outside of the track, it uses gravel traps similar to road courses. Hillenburg said this is for economical reasons, as a car sliding into a sand trap will not damage a car as much as hitting a wall.\n\nHillenburg noted, \"We've designed a track that can measure one's skill level and they can slide off into a sand trap and not a wall. I can now give parents a straight-up answer as to where their kids stack up.\" Jimmie Johnson was part of the opening group of drivers to test at \"Little Rock,\" and blew a tire. He jokingly said he nearly ran into his own transporter because of the track's design that lacked the concrete wall for safety.\n\nThe track also has an integrated quarter-mile oval for the Bandoleros and Legends cars.\n\nThe speedway has become a venue for active filming for movies, television programs, and television commercials, often with its venues being used for various facilities. Notable films include:\n\nWhen it was part of the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit, it also was a filming location for:\n\n\nIt was also used as venue for the truck pull event during World's Strongest Man 2011.\n\n"}

It tells the story of a couple that falls in love despite the girl's pessimistic outlook on life. Shortly after their wedding, a supernatural event tests the strength of their love and commitment to each other.\n\nThe title is taken from the 1938 torch song of the same title by Duke Ellington.\n\nImmediately after a young couple named Peter and Rita have exchanged wedding vows, an unknown elderly man asks to kiss the bride. As he does, Rita's soul and the old man's magically exchange bodies.\n\nNeither Peter nor the wedding guests grasp what has happened. Peter leaves the wedding with a woman he believes is Rita. During their honeymoon, he comes to realize that Rita's body is no longer inhabited by Rita's true personality. He must find the old man and keep his unconditional love for Rita alive despite the fact that she is now in an unattractive body.\n\nCritic Frank Rich wrote: \"...this play can be taken as an indirect treatment of [AIDS]. The epidemic is to Mr. Lucas what Babi Yar was to D. M. Thomas, and Peter's fidelity to his true love's soul is transparent. Critic James Hebert wrote: \"When it premiered in 1990 it was widely presumed to be an oblique response to the ravages of AIDS. Long removed from that time, it becomes a broader commentary on eternal topics like the limits of love and the meaning of commitment.\"\n\nThe play was commissioned and originally staged by South Coast Repertory, Costa Mesa, California in January 1988.

He played high school football and was a three-year varsity letterman at Montclair High School, where he was selected as a \"Blue Chip Illustrated\" All-American.\n\nOver Tyree's career at Syracuse, he ranked 13th on the career receiving record list with 1,214 yards, including 229 yards against Virginia Tech in 2002. He also developed a reputation for being an excellent special teams player, amassing six blocked punts.\n\nTyree was selected in the sixth round (211th overall) of the 2003 NFL Draft by the New York Giants. While with the Giants, he was primarily a backup, never catching more than 19 passes in a single season. However, he was best known for his special teams play, earning a Pro Bowl selection in 2005 as a special teams player.\n\nIn 2008, Tyree was placed on injured reserve for a knee injury suffered during training camp after being on the physically-unable-to-perform list most of the season. He was released during the final cuts on September 5, 2009.\n\nDuring the 2007 season, Tyree had four receptions for 35 yards with no touchdowns; however, his utilization in Super Bowl XLII was his most relevant contribution.\n\nTyree made two key plays in Super Bowl XLII. First, he caught a five-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Eli Manning, Tyree's first of the season, that gave the Giants a 10-7 lead late in the game. Later, on a third-and-five with 1:15 remaining and trailing 14-10, Manning eluded a sack and threw 32 yards downfield toward Tyree. In Manning's words, the ball \"floated\" high.\n\nTyree leaped and caught the ball fully extended, bringing it down against his helmet with his right hand, while the New England Patriots' Rodney Harrison pulled violently downward on that arm, simultaneously wrenching Tyree arching backwards towards the turf. Tyree, who got a second hand on the ball during the descent, seemingly kept the ball only inches from the turf, thereafter struggling successfully for possession while Harrison tried to steal the ball away from him on the ground. The play became known as \"The Helmet Catch\". \"I told you. He's a gamer,\" Manning commented to his brother, Peyton, regarding Tyree, after the game. ESPN \"SportsCenter\" named it the greatest play in Super Bowl history the following day. It was later voted for the 2008 ESPY Award for Play of the Year. The pass moved the Giants to the Patriots' 24-yard line with 59 seconds left. Four plays and 24 seconds later, Manning threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to Plaxico Burress for the winning touchdown. The final score of Super Bowl XLII was Giants 17, Patriots 14. Tyree dedicated this catch, which remains the last catch he has made in an NFL game, to his mother, Thelma, who died of a heart attack that year.\n\nTyree was signed by the Baltimore Ravens on October 13, 2009 after working out with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He appeared in ten games with the Ravens, but had no receptions.\n\nTyree signed a one-day contract with the New York Giants to announce his retirement from the NFL as a Giant on July 29, 2010. On February 5, 2012, he watched from the Giants sideline as his former team beat the Patriots again in Super Bowl XLVI. On July 22, 2014, he was named Director of Player Development for the New York Giants.\n\nTyree battled with alcohol addiction beginning in middle school, and in March 2004, he was arrested by the Fort Lee Police Department for possession of marijuana. His then-girlfriend Leilah told him she was pregnant with their second child the day he was released from jail. Later that month, Leilah \"presented Tyree with an ultimatum — her lifestyle or his.\" He began reading a Bible on her bed, and \"for the first time, the words on the page made sense\" to him. Tyree said from that day he never drank again. He and Leilah were married in June 2004. Tyree and his wife Leilah have seven children.\n\nHe is a born-again Christian and has made appearances at the 2008 and 2009 Christian concert \"BattleCry\". In 2006, he and his wife started Next In Line, a project that counsels teenagers in his hometown.\n\nIn 2011, Tyree became an advocate against legalization of same-sex marriage in New York with the National Organization for Marriage. Tyree said in an interview that the passage of the Marriage Equality Act would \"be the beginning of our country sliding toward...anarchy\". He said he would trade his famous catch and the team's Super Bowl title to keep marriage between a man and a woman. In 2014, he said he was no longer in support of gay conversion therapy.\n\n\n"}

This neighborhood is known for its concentration of eclectic architectural styles from three eras: The Victorian, Turn of the Century and Revival eras.\n\nThe Angelino Heights neighborhood is situated on a hill of about 502 feet in elevation, located within the Echo Park proper and west of Chinatown. The neighborhood's boundaries include the 101 Hollywood freeway to the south, Sunset Boulevard to the north and east, and Echo Park Lake to the west. Sunset Boulevard is the main thoroughfare that connects and services all three districts.\n\nOriginally spelled Angeleno Heights, Angelino Heights is second only to Bunker Hill as the oldest district in Los Angeles outside of Downtown. Founded in 1886, it was originally connected to the downtown mainline (which ran east to west on Temple Street) by the Temple Street Cable Railway and later by streetcars. It is known for its steep hills. The district contains many notable examples of Victorian architecture, particularly of the Eastlake and Queen Anne styles, and though found throughout the neighborhood, they are especially concentrated on Carroll Avenue. Two of these residences served as the houses used for the TV shows \"Charmed\" and Journeyman, used in the shows as San Francisco Victorian residences, and because of the picturesque nature of the neighborhood, they have served as the backdrop for countless motion pictures from the earliest days of cinema to the present.\nTraveling around the neighborhood, one also discovers that many other styles of architecturally significant homes are to be found here, such as Craftsman, Bungalow, Mission Revival, Art Deco, and Colonial Revival, to name a few.\n\nA large swath of Angelino Heights was destroyed to build the Hollywood Freeway, which cut it off from Temple Street save for an overpass at Edgeware Road.\n\nAngelino Heights was the City of Los Angeles' first recognized historic district, or Historic Preservation Overlay Zone (HPOZ). Enacted in 1983 and spelled out in Angelino Heights' Preservation Plan, this zoning prohibits unsympathetic remodelling of historic houses and requires new construction to resemble original architecture in scale, massing and materials.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department operates the Rampart Community Police Station, which was located at 2710 West Temple Street, 90026, serving the neighborhood. It has since moved east into a newly constructed facility at 1401 West 6th Street, the site of the former emergency receiving hospital.\n\nThe house that sits at 1345 Carroll Ave in Angelino Heights is known as the Sanders House and is most famous for being featured as the spooky setting for Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" music video. The 3,532-square-foot Queen Anne style house was originally built for a local warehouse operator named Michael Sanders in 1887.\n\nThe Sanders House was also featured in a Season 4 episode of \"Charmed,\" as well as the movie \"Teen Witch\" (1989).\n\nAngelino Heights is zoned to Los Angeles USD schools.\n\nAll residents are zoned to Plasencia Elementary School or Logan Elementary.\n\nSome residents are zoned to King Middle School, while some are zoned to Virgil Middle School.\n\nAll residents are zoned to Belmont High School.\n\n\n"}

The division includes one high school (Harrisonburg High School), two middle schools (Thomas Harrison Middle School, Skyline Middle School), six elementary schools (W.H. Keister Elementary School, Smithland Elementary School, Spotswood Elementary School, Stone Spring Elementary School, Waterman Elementary School, and Bluestone Elementary School), Elon Rhodes Early Learning Center and a vocational school, Massanutten Technical Center.\n\nMore than 6,400 students are enrolled in HCPS, and of these more than 35% are English language learners (English as a Second Language, ESL), making the school system one of the most diverse in the state of Virginia. The top foreign languages spoken by students are Spanish, Russian, and Kurdish. More than 70 languages are spoken by students.\n\nIn the early 2000s, controversy surrounded the construction of a new high school as well as the use of the old building. Initial discussions indicated the old building was to become a 5th and 6th grade intermediate school. However, in March 2005, the school board voted to turn the old high school property over to the city. This allowed Harrisonburg City Council to enter into a five-year $7.5 million lease of the old high school property (building, athletic fields, and parking lots) to James Madison University in July 2005. The agreement included an option to purchase the property, which JMU capitalized on, in May 2006, with an offer to purchase the property at $17 million. In June 2006, the sale was approved by the city council, as a method of funding street improvements and a new school.\n\nConstruction of Skyline Middle School And Smithland Elementary was completed in 2008. The schools are distinctly separate student bodies, but are located within one physically consolidated building. The fifth grade is located on the middle school side in the central connecting hallway, to allow the fifth grade to return to the elementary student body - should the school system decide to change grade configuration.\n\nAt the June 21, 2005 School Board meeting Dr. Ford, school superintendent, presented to the board for discussion whether when a new combined elementary school/middle school is opened it should open as a K-4; 5-8 or a K-5; 6-8 configuration. The issues are:\n\n\nSchool board member Kerri Wilson proposed that the board consider an alternative to the above. Her proposal is to make the four current elementary schools K-3 schools, using Thomas Harrison Middle School as a division-wide 4-5 school. And instead of building a combined school, build a new 6-8 middle school for the city. K-3 students would attend existing elementary schools and the size of each school would eventually be 400-450; 4th and 5th grade students would be educated in a single school facility at Thomas Harrison and the enrollment there would eventually be 850-900; and grades 6 to 8 would at \"build out\" be in a single school of 1300-1400 students. Each school would, of course, begin with smaller numbers than those listed above since there are about 325 students per grade level currently division-wide. Mrs. Wilson discussed her reasons for her proposal and agreed to send to the board her list of advantages for this configuration.\n\nIn May 2019, Harrisonburg City Public Schools initiated a two phase process of Programming and Design for a second high school, with a targeted opening of Fall 2022.\n\nHCPS elementary schools serve kindergarten through fifth grade.\n\nHCPS middle schools serve grades six through eight. \n\n\n\n"}

The film stars Diane Keaton (who also directed), Meg Ryan, and Lisa Kudrow as the three sisters, and Walter Matthau (in his final film appearance) as the father. The film is based on 1995 novel of the same name by Delia Ephron.\n\nGeorgia Mozell, Eve Marks and Maddy Mozell are adult sisters. Georgia (Keaton) is the editor of her own wildly successful self-titled women's magazine. She strives for publicity at any cost. Party planner Eve (Ryan) is the mother hen of the group, not only of her own family, but also of her siblings and father as their mother, Pat (Leachman), not only emotionally left their father when they divorced, but her daughters as well. And Maddy (Kudrow) is a vacuous soap opera actress who has always struggled for her own identity. Despite being as busy with her own life as the others, Eve is the only one of the three who deals with the long term hospitalization of their cantankerous seventy-nine-year-old father, Lou Mozell (Matthau), when he enters the early stages of dementia, and the associated outcomes of that hospitalization. Eve is caring for Lou, who himself is a John Wayne fan, despite an especially hurtful incident with him seven years earlier (when he told her she was a mistake). As the emotional aspect of looking after Lou becomes more and more stressful, Eve has to figure out how to maintain her own sanity, while dealing with her sisters, who believe they too are part of their father's care while they don't lift a finger to help.\n\nAt one point, Lou ruins a birthday party for Eve's son Jesse and is expelled from the household by Eve's husband Joe (Adam Arkin).\n\nWhen their father's health worsens, the three sisters reunite and ask who his favorite actress is. Before dying, Lou replies that it is June Allyson. The three sisters mourn their father's death, while flashbacks reveal of Lou having great times with his three daughters and John Wayne. The three sisters get together for Thanksgiving, while Maddy reveals that she has retired as an actress after her character tries a decaf cappuccino and is randomly murdered.\n\n\n\"Hanging Up\" was released in the United States on February 18, 2000, to relatively negative reviews.

The school has approximately 1500 students, and is operated by the Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board.\n\nEvery two years, Loyola hosts \"Culturefest\", a celebration of Canada's diverse cultural make-up that features pavilions, food, and entertainment. The next Culturefest is slated for Spring 2020.\n\nOriginally, the old building (at South Common Court) was built as a middle school in 1978. It had gone through a series of expansions to accommodate the excess of students in the area; for example, an additional floor level was built. Although upgraded and renovated, it lacked the quality of facilities found in other secondary schools within the region.\n\nIn the 2006-2007 year, the school lobbied the Dufferin-Peel Catholic District Schoolboard for a new facility. The new Loyola building was originally approved for construction in 2001. Complete architectural plans for the building were finished, and the project was ready to move underway. However, due to changes in government, the funding for the project was cut, and it was postponed indefinitely. The next time the issue was raised, it was a tie vote that was the result of a strong lobby by parents from Holy Name of Mary SS who did not want to move to the old Loyola campus. The 2006-2007 lobby was an attempt to get this project up and running again, as millions had already been spent on planning the new school, and the Loyola community wished for a facility on par with those enjoyed by other secondary schools. The Board voted against the project in favour of building new elementary schools in the Brampton region.\n\nOn April 28, 2009, the trustees of the Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board finally decided to give the Loyola Catholic Secondary School community a new and larger school. The plans included the creation of new programs, a full-size gymnasium and ample parking for its 1,300 students with a budget of $49.3 million.\n\nAfter more than 10 years of lobbying the new facility was ready. The school body moved in on Aug 30, 2012. The school now sits on of land on Burnhamthorpe Rd. and Ridgeway Dr, several blocks west of its previous location. The school now neighbours Oakville, Ontario.\n\nThe old facility at South Common Court has now been converted into an education centre named after Canada's first aboriginal Saint, St. Kateri Tekakwitha.\n\n\n\n"}
