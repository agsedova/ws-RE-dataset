Tourist traps will typically provide services, entertainment, food, souvenirs and other products for tourists to purchase. \n\nWhile some establishments may be viewed by tourists as fun and interesting diversions, tourist traps can also have negative connotations when they direct travelers off highways into commercial areas, and could potentially be tacky, deceitful and an overall waste of time and money.\n\nThere are a large number of \"big things\" in Australia. Many of those were initially created as tourist traps, but have gained cult status in the country since.\n\nClifton Hill, Niagara Falls is a popular tourist trap in Niagara Falls, Ontario. The street attractions are owned by two entities. The area also extends to a small portion north of Victoria Avenue east and west of Clifton Hill and Centre Street north of Victoria Avenue.\n\nIn some areas, simple facilities may be a sufficient draw to entice tourists to stop. Wall Drug, in South Dakota, began its tourist trade by offering free ice water.\n\nBreezewood, Pennsylvania represents a physical tourist trap at the intersection of Interstate 70 and Interstate 76, where the two major highways are not directly connected; forcing transiting drivers off the interstate and \"into several suddenly urban blocks with traffic lights and a dense bazaar of gas stations, fast food restaurants and motels.\"\n\nSouth of the Border is an attraction on Interstate 95 (I-95), US Highway 301 (US 301) and US 501 in Dillon, South Carolina, just south of Rowland, North Carolina. It is so named because it is just south of the border between North Carolina and South Carolina, and was the half way point to Florida from New York in the early days of motor travel. The area is themed in tongue-in-cheek, faux-Mexican style. The rest area contains restaurants, gas stations, a video arcade, and a motel, and truck stop as well as a small amusement park, a mini golf course, shopping and fireworks stores. Its mascot is Pedro, a caricature of a Mexican bandido. South of the Border is known for its roadside billboard advertisements, which begin many miles away from and incorporate a mileage countdown to the attraction itself. The stop has since fallen on hard times as more modern hotel areas have grown along I-95.\n\nA few establishments take pride in the term and embody it into their names, such as \"Da Yoopers Tourist Trap\", run by the comedy troupe Da Yoopers in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, and \"The Tourist Trap\" at Deep Creek Lake, Maryland.\n\n"}

{"id": "2111410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111410", "title": "Solage", "text": "Solage\n\nSolage (or Soulage), possibly Jean So(u)lage (fl. late 14th century) was a French composer, and probably also a poet. He composed the most pieces in the Chantilly Codex, the principal source of music of the \"ars subtilior\", the manneristic compositional school centered on Avignon at the end of the century.\n\nNothing is known about Solage's life, beyond what can be inferred from the texts to his music. Even his name is a puzzle. One possibility is that the single name \"Solage\" is a nickname or pseudonym, similar to others known from the period, such as Grimace or Hasprois . \"Solage\" and \"soulage\" are variant spellings of Old French \"solaz\", \"solace\", meaning \"consolation\", \"joy\", or \"entertainment\" . In the refrain to the text of \"Calextone qui fut dame\", the composer refers to himself with such a double meaning, using the spelling \"soulage\" . However, the possibility that it is a genuine name cannot be ruled out. One of the attributions in the Chantilly Codex includes the initial \"J\" wrapped into the name, so it is possible his first name was Je(h)an. There are many references from that time to people called Jean Soulas (a name still found in modern times), and the surname Soulage or Soulages also existed (for example, Guillaume de Soulages, count of Canillac, documented from a wedding in 1392), though there are no clear candidates for the composer . Gilbert Reaney's suggestion that the composer's first name might have been Charles rested on a speculative identification of Solage with another composer found in the Chantilly Codex, Goscalch, \"a rather German-sounding name\" that might be an anagram of \"Ch. Solag(e)\" . However, Reaney's claim that the name occurs nowhere apart from the Chantilly Codex has been proven wrong, as several other identifications have been found, and the possible identity of the two composers has been rejected .\n\nSpecific references in the texts of some of his songs indicate he probably was associated with the French royal court . The ballade \"S'aincy estoit\" glorifies Jean, duc de Berry, and was written to celebrate his second marriage, to Jeanne de Boulogne, which took place with great pomp near Avignon on 25 May 1389. The pair of ballades, \"Corps femenin par vertu de nature\" and \"Calextone qui fut dame\" also refer to Jeanne de Boulogne, and their texts show that the former was composed shortly before and the latter shortly after this wedding. Although it is tempting to suppose that Solage might have been in the service of the duke of Berry, it is just as likely that he was in the service of Gaston Fébus, compte de Foix, who had a considerable financial interest in this marriage .\n\nThere is also a possible connection to, or at least an indication of some cultural exchange with the court of Giangaleazzo Visconti, the Duke of Milan, in the text of Solage's virelai,\" Joieux de Cuer\". The Visconti family motto, \"'a bon droit\", is prominently placed at the beginning of the ninth line, at the beginning of the reprise of the first musical section, and just before the return of the refrain. Although Giangaleazzo died in 1402, his daughter Valentina continued to employ the motto until her death in 1408 . In his chanson \"Pluseurs gens\" Solage mentioned Jacqueline, the granddaughter of Philippe, Duke of Burgundy, who was born in 1401 and betrothed in 1403. The association with Jacqueline is conjectural, however, since the name actually found in \"Pluseurs gens\" is \"Jaquete\" .\n\nBecause the texts of Solage's songs are found only in his musical settings, and because they show amongst them kindred turns of phrase as well as syntactic and lexical preferences that lend a sense of unity, it is probable that he wrote the words as well as the music. Other composers represented in the Chantilly Codex were also likely poet-composers, in particular Jacob Senleches .\n\nOne especially plain example of textual interrelationships concerns the two ballades \"Corps femenin\" and \"Calextone qui fut\". The former is based on the acrostic CATHELLINE LA ROYNE DAMOURS, and the latter begins with what could be the same acrostic, CATHELLI ..., but the second and third stanzas of this ballade are not preserved . There are no other surviving examples of such twin ballades in the literature of this period .\n\nStylistically, Solage's works exhibit two distinctly different characters: a relatively simple one usually associated with his great predecessor and elder contemporary Guillaume de Machaut, and a more \"recherché\" one, complex in the areas of both pitch and rhythm, characteristic of the ars subtilior (\"more subtle art\"). These two styles mostly exist separately in different songs but sometimes are found mixed in a single composition, where they can be used to underscore the musical and poetic structure. In his simpler \"Machaut\" style pieces Solage nevertheless makes many personal choices that are very different from what Machaut typically does. Moreover, the simpler style is not necessarily an indication of an earlier date nor the complex style a reliable sign of a later date. Solage uses his techniques to link text and music together, either in terms of form or else of meaning . Nevertheless, some of his ars subtilior music was quite experimental: the best-known example in this complex style is his bizarre \"Fumeux fume par fumée\" (approx: \"The smoky one smokes through [or for] smoke\"), which is extravagantly chromatic for the time; it also contains some of the lowest tessitura vocal writing in any music of the period .\n\nSolage's rondeau is associated with a putative literary school of \"fumeurs\". There have been many interpretations of this sobriquet. Although it is tempting given the \"outré\" nature of some poems to suppose that it refers to the smoking of some drug, the simplest explanation in the case of the above work is that it was written for the Parisian Fumeurs, the Society of Smokers, \"an eccentric literary clique of ostentatiously dressed bohemians that named themselves after \"Jean Fumeux\" and flourished in the 1360s and 1370s\" . One scholar suggests that Eustache Deschamps's poetry, which contains most of the surviving references to the fumeurs, was satirical . The literature associated with the Fumeurs is dated between 1366 and 1381, and Solage's ballade \"Plusieurs gens voy\" also alludes to them . In his \"Règles de la Seconde Rhétorique\" Deschamps claims to be the nephew of Machaut, and in his Ballade 447 states that Machaut \"brought me up and did me many kindnesses\". Though there is no independent verification of these claims, it seems likely that they must have been on close terms . On the other hand, if indeed the \"Fumeurs\" were literally devotees of smoking, since tobacco was not known in Europe for another two centuries, some other drug, e.g. hashish or opium, must have been implied. However, the current consensus among musicologists is that there was no physical smoking . In the Middle Ages, the French expression \"avoir des fumées au cerveau\" (having smoke in the brain) referred to mental confusion, a condition attributed to internal vapours which, according to ancient authorities such as Hippocrates and Aristotle, could be evacuated from \"heated and smoky brains\" either by sneezing or by drinking. Similarly, drinking in the morning was referred to as \"abattre le brouillard\"—\"breaking up the fog\" .\n\nAll of Solage's known compositions are found in the Chantilly Codex, and only one of these is found anywhere else. This is the four-voiced ballade \"Pluseurs gens voy qui leur pensee\", which was obviously copied from Chantilly into the important Florentine manuscript Florence, Bibl. Nazionale, Panciatichi 26, only without its text and lacking identification of its composer (; ). Only ten works are inscribed with Solage's name in the Chantilly Codex (one of them, \"Tres gentil cuer\", is found there twice), but two more can be attributed to him on stylistic grounds . One of these, \"Le mont Aôn de Trace\", is also found in the same Florence manuscript with \"Pluseurs gens voy\" . These twelve works consist of 9 ballades, 2 virelais and a rondeau:\nAnonymous in the source, but attributable on stylistic grounds:\nAll of Solage's works have been recorded by Gothic Voices on the Avie Records label.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2111431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111431", "title": "Robin Laws", "text": "Robin Laws\n\nRobin D. Laws (born October 14, 1964 in Orillia, Ontario, Canada) is a Canadian writer and game designer who lives in Toronto, Canada. He is the author of a number of novels and role-playing games as well as an anthologist.\n\nRobin D. Laws has been a professional game designer and an author since the early 1990s.\n\nRobin D. Laws has been playing role-playing games since he was a teenager and has worked as a game designer since the early 1990s. John Nephew of Atlas Games convinced Jonathan Tweet to publish a game he had been writing about in \"Alarums & Excursions\"; Laws talked with Tweet about the game in \"A&E\" and contributed to the final product as well, the result of which was \"Over the Edge\" (1992). Daedalus Games began when Laws approached Jose Garcia in 1993 with an idea for a Hong Kong Action Cinema RPG; while Garcia liked the idea, his first priority was his own setting, \"\" which was published in 1994 with Garcia as the main designer and developer, and Laws, Bruce Baugh, and Rob Heinsoo as additional authors. Daedalus Games was incorporated as Daedalus Entertainment in preparation for publishing in the Hong Kong action setting Laws had designed, but beginning with a collectible-card game to take advantage of that then-booming market.; Laws therefore designed the collectible card game \"Shadowfist\" (1995). Daedalus Entertainment subsequently published Laws' role-playing game \"Feng Shui\" (1996), which used a variant of the \"Nexus\" game system, and began to publish supplements. However, Daedalus filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1997; when the company sold off a few of its properties a few years later, Laws re-acquired \"Feng Shui\". Nephew told Laws that he would be happy to bring \"Feng Shui\" back into print, so when Laws was able to free up the rights he brought it to Atlas Games, in a deal announced on March 22, 1999.\n\nMeanwhile, Laws was active throughout the 1990s as a free-lance writer for games including \"GURPS\", \"Underground\", \"Talislanta\", \"Earthdawn\", and \"\", and later for supplements to the third edition of \"Dungeons & Dragons\". In 1998, Greg Stafford approached Laws to create a new game based on his world of Glorantha, which became known as \"Hero Wars\", published in 2000 as the first fully professional product for Issaries, and later expanded and re-published in 2003 as \"HeroQuest\". A second edition was published in 2009; Laws was then able to provide additional scaffolding for players to construct setting-appropriate narratives with the rules provided. At the same time, Laws was engaged in some more experimental RPG design. Hogshead Publishing published his \"Pantheon and Other Roleplaying Games\" (2000) as one of the company's \"New Style\" RPGs., while Atlas Games contracted Laws to write the \"Rune\" (2001) role-playing game, based on the computer game \"Rune\". Laws determined that for \"Rune\", \"the game would need to have a big point of difference to distinguish it from the many other fantasy games available\"; in this case, the game would allow players to swap roles with the Game Master (GM): \"You can win! And when you're not the GM, it's not boring because the GM can win!\"\n\nPelgrane Press revealed on January 20, 2000 that Laws would be the core author of their upcoming roleplaying game based on the Jack Vance stories in the Dying Earth setting. Laws was the senior designer for \"The Dying Earth Roleplaying Game\". As Pelgrane Press expanded, they launched the GUMSHOE system, designed by Laws based on the claim that investigative gaming had been introduced to RPGs under the mistaken assumption that acquiring clues should be treated as a contingent reward; the new system ensured that players would learn the clues needed in order to proceed with their investigations. Laws' \"The Esoterrorists\" (2006) was the first release with this system, supported by his sourcebook \"The Esoterror Factbook\" (2006); the next year, Pelgrane released Laws' \"Fear Itself\" (2007). Laws has also contributed supplements to Ken Hite's \"Trail of Cthulhu\" line, notably the aleatoric \"Armitage Files\" resource and the \"Dreamhounds of Paris\" campaign frame, in which players take on the roles of actual surrealist artists as they confront horror in the Dreamlands. Laws also designed \"Mutant City Blues\" (2009) and \"Ashen Stars\" (2011) as investigative games in superhero and space opera genres. His RPG \"Skulduggery\" (2010) extrapolated the treatment of conflict, especially intrapersonal conflict, from the \"Dying Earth\" setting to a variety of other contexts, and the \"Gaean Reach RPG\" (2012) cross-fertilized \"Dying Earth\" and GUMSHOE rules in Vance's Science Fiction setting.\n\nIn 2012, Laws also ran a Kickstarter for his game \"Hillfolk\", featuring his new Dramasystem. The goal was $3,000, but raised over $93,000, and it went on to win the 2014 Diana Jones award.. After another successful Kickstarter by Atlas Games, Laws released a second edition of \"Feng Shui\" twenty years after its original release, removing obstructive rules and marking a \"critical shift\" in the game's background. Laws has since published the specialized \"Cthulhu Confidential\" (2017), offering a modified GUMSHOE system for roleplaying with one player and the GM, and has begun work on the \"Yellow King RPG\", also for Pelgrane Press.\n\nRobin D. Laws' published his first novel \"Pierced Heart\" in 1996, set in the world of \"Over the Edge\"; it was released as an e-book in 2014. His subsequent novels included the original \"The Rough and the Smooth\" as well as novels set in the game settings of \"Warhammer RPG\", \"City of Heroes\" and \"Pathfinder\". Laws also had stories published in Synister Creative's pulp magazine, and in the fiction anthology \"The Book of All Flesh\" for the \"All Flesh Must Be Eaten\" RPG: \"The first is a light-hearted adventure, and the other is really, really dark\". Laws wrote \"Robin's Laws of Good Game Mastering\" (2002) for Steve Jackson Games. and edited \"40 Years of Gen Con\" (2007), a collection of interviews and photographs, published by Atlas. Laws also wrote \"Hamlet's Hit Points\" (2010), published by small press company Gameplaywright, and is currently working on a second volume applying the same approach to narrative structure with a focus on fiction and screenplay writing. Laws is also the editor of the Stone Skin Press fiction imprint from Pelgrane Press.\n\nIn other media, he contributed to the \"King of Dragon Pass\" computer game and wrote for Marvel's \"Iron Man\" with Mike Grell in 2003. He writes an irregular advice column for role-players called \"See Page XX\", and releases a weekly podcast with Ken Hite for Pelgrane Press, \"Ken and Robin talk about stuff\".\n\nRobin Laws is frequently invited to be a guest speaker at conventions around the world, having made appearances at Gen Con Australia and Ropecon in Finland.\n\nLaws attends Gen Con Indy and the Toronto International Film Festival every year. He has stated that he often cannot attend Fan Expo Canada because that convention often takes place too soon after Gen Con and too soon before TIFF, but he likes to attend it whenever he can. He was Fan Expo's gaming guest of honor in 2005 and 2010.\n\nSince 2010, Laws has participated in Dragonmeet in London as a guest of Pelgrane Press.\n\nA partial list of works by Robin D Laws:\n\n\"Ashen Stars\"\n\n\"Cthulhu Confidential\"\n\nFor \"\"\n\nFor \"Dungeons and Dragons\":\n\nFor the \"Earthdawn\" RPG:\n\n\"The Esoterrorists\"\n\"Fear Itself\"\n\n\"Feng Shui: Action Movie Roleplaying\"\n\nFor the \"Firefly Role-Playing Game\":\n\n\"Gaean Reach\" RPG\n\nFor the \"Glorantha\" setting (Greg Stafford)\n\n\nFor \"GURPS\":\n\n\"Hillfolk\"\n\n\"Jack Vance's The Dying Earth Roleplaying Game\"\n\n\"Mutant City Blues\"\n\n\"\" (\"et al.\")\n\n\"OG: Unearthed Edition\"\n\nFor \"Over the Edge\":\n\n\"Pandemonium!: Adventures in Tabloid World\" (Contributor)\n\n\"Pantheon and Other Roleplaying Games\"\n\n\"Robin's Laws of Good Game Mastering\" ()\n\n\"Rune\"\n\n\"Shadowfist Players' Guide (Volume 1)\" (with Rob Heinsoo)\n\n\"Star Trek RPG\" (\"et al.\")\n\n\"Star Trek: The Next Generation RPG\" (\"et al.\")\n\nFor \"Talislanta\":\n\nFor \"Trail of Cthulhu\"\n\nFor the \"Underground RPG\":\n\nFor \"\":\n\nFor \"\":\n\nFor \"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay\"\n\n\n"}

From March to June the group undertook their Hungry Mile Tour across Australia and to New Zealand.\n\nIn November 2011 The Go Set worked with Australian rock producer Paul McKercher on their 6th album, recorded at Hothouse Studios in St Kilda, Melbourne. The self-titled album features the single 'Drums of Chelsea' and was released in March 2012. In the following month Keenan told Chris Yates of \"The Music\", of their proposed tour, \"If you said to any other musician, you're going to Europe for a month, you're playing every night, you're playing eight different countries, you're playing at five festivals where you're gonna be playing to thousands of people, dudes would be climbing over each other to get on that flight!\"\n\nDuring August 2013 they supported a tour by the Real McKenzies, with \"BMA\"s Rory McCartney observing, \"[their] fusion of punk with bagpipes, kilts, tin whistles, and even a mandolin might seem an odd mix... [however] the five-piece has had 13 different members over the years. Touring takes its toll on families and the band has a revolving line-up.\" McCartney reflected on the group's song writing, \"Like its sound, the band's lyrical material has also been heavily influenced by the members' heritage. Keenan's parents were very left-leaning. This made him serious about music and wanting to leave a legacy people could connect to, one that rises above popular culture.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

He converted to Islam in 1888, and is considered by historians to be the earliest prominent Anglo-American Muslim convert. In 1893 he was the only person representing Islam at the first Parliament of the World's Religions.\n\nHis father, Alexander Nelson Webb, was a leading journalist of his day and perhaps influenced his son’s later journalistic exploits.\n\nWebb received his early education at the Home School in Glendale, Massachusetts and later attended Claverack College, an advanced high school near Hudson, New York. He became editor of the \"Unionville Republican\", Unionville, Missouri. His prowess as a journalist was soon apparent, and he was offered the city editorship of the \"St. Joseph Gazette\" in St. Joseph, Missouri. Next he became associate editor of the \"Missouri Morning Journal\". Later he became the Assistant City Editor of the \"Missouri Republican\" in St. Louis. This newspaper was the second oldest and largest daily newspaper at that time.\n\nWhile working for the Missouri Republican, he was appointed (in September, 1887) by President Cleveland to be Consular Representative to the Philippines at the U.S. office at Manila. According to the editor of his book \"The Three Lectures\", he had given up any concept of religion at least fifteen years before that point.\n\nIn 1887 Webb was introduced to Islam by the works of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian, India, the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement. Webb wrote two letters to Ghulam Ahmad. Webb's first clear step toward Islam was expressed in these correspondences. These letters were published then in Ghulam Ahmad's book \"Shahne-e-Haqq\" page 372 and 439. At that time he had yet to meet a Muslim but was put in contact with several Muslims in India by a local Parsi businessman. A newspaper publisher, Budruddin Abdulla Kur of Bombay, published several of Webb's letters in his paper. A local businessman, Hajee Abdulla Arab, a follower of Ghulam Ahmad, saw these letters and went to Manila to see Webb. In 1888, he formally declared himself to be a Muslim. Although Webb acknowledged Ghulam Ahmad as \"a man of God\" and the one who had guided him to Islam, and kept in contact with Ahmadis until his death in 1916, the Ahmadiyya literature does not record whether or not Webb was an Ahmadi Muslim, nor does his work show allegiance towards Ahmadiyya eschatology.\n\nAlthough Webb encountered some hostility because of his beliefs, the American press that reported on his activities did not question his patriotism, but dubbed him instead \"the Yankee Mohammedan\".\n\nAfter the visit, Webb began plans to tour India and then return to the U.S. to propagate Islam. Webb's wife, Ella G. Webb, and their three children had also converted to Islam by this time. Hajee Abdulla returned to India and raised funds for Webb's tour. Webb visited Poona, Bombay, Calcutta, Hyderabad, and Madras and gave speeches in each town. In India, he repeatedly expressed his dislike of Westernization and its effect on colonized Muslims. He viewed Muslims who were blindly imitating the West, adopted its style of clothing, and abandoned their own as servile and unworthy of their rich heritage. He saw them as far removed from a genuine Islamic ethos, stating: \"The only Mohammedans in all the East who drink intoxicating beverages are those who have been educated in England and wear European clothes. Their contact with Christian nations has demoralized them, and they have drifted away from their religion.\" \n\nIn 1892 he travelled to Egypt and Turkey where he could continue studying Islam. While in Istanbul in 1893, he resigned his post with the State Department and returned to America.\n\nSettling in New York, he established the Oriental Publishing Company at 1122 Upper Broadway. This company published his writings, including his magnum opus \"Islam in America\", which comprised eight chapters: \nAlong with this venture he started the organ of the American Muslim Propagation Movement called \"Moslem World\". The first issue appeared May 12, 1893, and was dedicated to \"The Interests of the American Islamic Propaganda\" and \"[t]o spread the light of Islam in America\". It lasted for seven monthly issues (May to November 1893).\n\nIn December 1893, John A. Lant and Emin L. Nabakoff broke from Webb's movement and formed the First Society for the Study of Islam and set up shop in Union Square.\n\nWebb was the main representative for Islam at the 1893 World Parliament of Religions in Chicago. On September 20 and 21, 1893, he gave two speeches. His speeches were entitled: \"The Influence of Social Condition\" and \"The Spirit of Islam\" and were published in the large two volume proceedings of the Parliament called \"The First World's Parliament of Religions\" (1894).\n\nFor the rest of his life he was the main spokesman for Islam in America. Many of America’s most prominent thinkers heard him speak on the Islamic Faith, including Mark Twain.\n\nOn Broadway, in Manhattan, he founded a short-lived masjid (Mosque). The reasons for the termination of this Masjid are unknown, but it could be due to a lack of financial support from India. Throughout the rest of America he started study circles, i.e. in Chicago, Washington, D.C., Newark, Manhattan, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Cleveland. They were named Mecca Study Circle No. I (NYC), Koran Study Circle, Capital Study Circle No. 4, etc. Each using an Islamic city or reference in its title. It is likely they studied Webb's works and those he suggested. The last meeting was in 1943 in Manhattan and was attended by his daughter Aliyyah.\n\nHe is also known for his writing of two booklets about the Armenian Genocide from a Muslim point of view: \"The Armenian Troubles and Where the Responsibility Lies\" and \"A Few Facts About Turkey Under the Rule of Abdul Hamid II\". He was appointed the Honorary Turkish Consul in New York by Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The Sultan had been shown plans by Webb for a Muslim cemetery and Masjid and complimented Webb on them. These plans never materialized.\n\nFrom 1898 to the time of his death on October 1, 1916, aged 69, he lived in Rutherford, New Jersey. There he owned and edited the “Rutherford Times”. He was buried in Hillside Cemetery, Lyndhurst, on the outskirts of Rutherford.\n\n\n\n"}

Its procedure is dictated by Law 16 of the Laws of the Game.\n\nA goal kick is awarded to the defending team when the ball goes out of the field of play by crossing, either on the ground or in the air, the goal line, without a goal being scored, when the last person to touch the ball was from the attacking team. If the last person to touch the ball was a member of the defending side, a corner kick is instead awarded to the attackers.\n\nA goal kick is awarded to the defending team when the ball goes directly into the goal, having last been touched by the attacking team, from a situation in which the laws do not permit an attacking goal to be scored directly. These are:\n\n\n\nGoal kicks are most often taken by goalkeepers, but this is not compulsory under the laws of the game.\n\nIf the kick is taken with a moving ball, or from the wrong place, the goal kick is retaken.\n\nOpponents must \"attempt\" to leave the penalty area before the goal kick is taken. However, if a \"quick\" goal kick is taken while an opponent is attempting to leave the penalty area, that opponent may touch or challenge for the ball once it is in play.\n\nIf an opposing player \"deliberately\" remains inside the penalty area, or enters the penalty area before the goal kick is taken, the goal kick is retaken. If this happens a number of times, the opposing player is booked for persistent infringement of the Laws of the Game.\n\nA player who excessively delays the restart of play is cautioned.\n\nIf the kicker touches the ball a second time before it has been touched by another player, an indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team from the place where the offence occurred, unless the second touch was also a more serious handling offence, which is punished by a direct free kick (or a penalty kick if within the penalty area and the kicker was not the goalkeeper) for the opposing team.\n\nAnalogues of the goal kick are found in early codes of football. The first published set of rules for any code of football, that of Rugby School (1845), featured a \"kick out\" from ten yards or twenty-five yards after a team touched the ball down in its own goal area. This was the ancestor of the 22-metre drop out in modern rugby union. A similar 25-yard \"kick out\" is found in the first version of the Sheffield rules (1858).\n\nThe original FA rules of 1863 defined the \"free kick from the goal line\", the ancestor of the goal-kick, thus:\n\nThere are several differences between this \"free kick from the goal line\" and the modern goal-kick:\n\n\nIt was not possible for a player to be offside from such a kick, a feature of the laws that has remained constant to the present day.\n\nIn 1866, the law was changed to award a goal-kick to the defending team regardless of which team touched the ball. (If the attacking team touched the ball down, it was awarded a \"touch down\", which served as a tie-breaker if the match ended level on goals; however the defending team was still awarded a goal-kick.) \nIn 1867, following an amendment proposed by Wanderers FC, the law was simplified; both the requirement for a touch-down, and the short-lived \"touch-down\" tiebreaker, were completely removed from the laws. The goal-kick could now be taken from any point \"within six yards from the limit of [the] goal\", and the opponents were forbidden from approaching within six yards of the ball.\n\nThe 1867 law was criticized for allowing defenders and goalkeepers to kick the ball out of play over the goal line, in the knowledge that they would be rewarded with possession from the ensuing restart.\n\nThis state of affairs lasted until 1872, when the corner-kick law was introduced from Sheffield rules football. Under the 1872 law, a goal-kick could be awarded only when the ball was kicked directly \"over\" the goal (by either side). When the ball crossed the goal-line to \"the side\" of the goal, a corner-kick was awarded to either the attacking or defensive side, depending on which team last touched the ball before it went out of play. \nThis law was rewritten the next year (1873) on the basis of a proposal by Great Marlow FC: a goal kick was awarded when the ball was kicked out of play over the goal-line by the attacking side. The kick had to be taken from within six yards of the nearest goal post. The 1873 law ran: \n\nThe phrase \"goal kick\" is recorded in general usage as early as 1867, but does not appear in the laws of the game until 1890. Before this, phrases such as \"kick it off from the goal line\" were used.\n\nThe goal kick of 1873 was taken from \"within 6 yards of the goal post nearest the point where the ball went out of play\". In 1891, pitch markings were added to define the six-yard radius from each goal-post. In 1902, the term \"goal area\" was introduced for the place from which the goal kick was taken; it assumed its modern dimensions as a rectangle extending six yards from each goal post. The goal-kick had to be taken from the half of the goal area nearest to the spot where the ball went out of play. This requirement was removed in 1992, when it was permitted to take the goal-kick from any point within the goal-area. This change was made in order to \"eliminate[] one of the common timewasting tactics\".\n\nIn 1913 and 1914, the distance opponents were required to retreat was increased from six yards to ten yards. In 1948, opponents were required to be completely outside the penalty area when the goal-kick was taken.\n\nIn 1905, it was specified that the ball \"must make a complete circuit or travel the distance of its circumference\" before being in play. In 1936, after a proposal by the Scottish Football Association, a new restriction was added: it was specified that the goal-kick must leave the penalty area before becoming in play; if the ball does not leave the penalty area, the kick has to be retaken. The goalkeeper was also explicitly forbidden from \"receiv[ing] the ball into his hands from a goal-kick in order that he may thereafter kick it into play\". In 2019, the requirement that the ball had to leave the penalty area was removed: the ball became in-play as soon as it was kicked and clearly moved.\n\nIn 1890, it was forbidden to score a goal directly from a goal-kick. In 1997, the laws were amended to allow a goal to be scored directly from a goal-kick, but only against the opposing team.\n\nIn 1890, the player taking the goal kick was forbidden from touching the ball a second time before it had touched another player.\n\nIn 1890, an indirect free-kick was awarded to the opposition when the player taking the goal kick touched the ball twice. In 1939, it was clarified that this penalty did not apply if the ball was touched twice before it had entered play by leaving the penalty area—in that case the kick was to be retaken instead.\n\nIn 1905, encroachment by the opposition at a goal-kick was also punished with an indirect free-kick. This penalty was removed in 1937. In 1997, the laws explicitly stated that, in the case of encroachment by the opposition, the kick should be retaken.\n\nThis table describes all kicks awarded to the defending team after the ball goes out of play over the goal line, including the defensive corner kick from the 1872 laws.\n"}

{"id": "2111497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111497", "title": "Montecatini Terme", "text": "Montecatini Terme\n\nMontecatini Terme is an Italian municipality (\"comune\") of c. 20,000 inhabitants in the province of Pistoia, Tuscany, central Italy. It is the most important center in Valdinievole. The town is located at the eastern end of Piana di Lucca and has a strong vocation for tourism, as well as industrial and commercial industries related to the spa, which in turn has increased the interest for hotel accommodation in the region.\n\nThe presence of man in the area of Montecatini is very old. Probably from Paleolithic times the region was frequented by itinerant hunters, but only from the Mesolithic period is there evidence of numerous settlements especially in the hills of the Valdievole.\n\nThe existence of Montecatini Castello, today’s Montecatini Alto, was already documented in medieval times. In the settlement there was already a spa, thanks to the salt waters of the city, which later also flowed into the plain below. There is evidence for this in a document from 1340 which refers to the extraction of salt from the water. There is also proof in a letter sent by the merchant Francesco di Marco Datini in which he requests from his doctor the healing water of the Montecatini baths. Other evidence comes from the famous doctor Ugolino of Montecatini who examined the waters scientifically for the first time. He also tells us that there were three baths in Montecatini; the Bagno Della Regina, the Bagno dei Merli and the Bagno Nuovo. Today the Bagno Nuovo is known as the Tettuccio.\n\nIn Medieval times the inhabitants of the city found themselves in conditions of real discomfort, having to fight epidemics, diseases and wars. The battles between the cities (Florence, Pisa and Lucca) that took place in Montecatini forced the population to move to the surrounding hills, because the town was the scene of continuous clashes. We must also remember that Montecatini was mainly constituted of \"padule\" (marshes). Tito Livio confirms this when he described how Hannibal of Carthage passed by the \"padule\" of Fucecchio in his march to the south.\n\nFrom the tenth century until 1270 with the Republic of Lucca, attempts were made to reclaim the territory, which was affected by epidemics of malaria. However the work was not completed successfully and resulted in pools of water being created where the water stagnated. \nIn these muddy waters many men found death at the Battle of Montecatini in 1315. It is thought that Dante Alighieri participated in this battle. \nIn 1328 the Medici came to power and the locks that had been dismantled with the reclamation were restored.\n\nFrom 1339 the Valdinievole was under the dominion of the Medici in Florence, who did not bring important benefits to the Baths and the City of Montecatini. \nCosimo Medici was the first person to build a bridge-dam to cross the muddy waters of the area. The initiative brought great economic improvements, but it was detrimental to the inhabitants of the Valdinievole. \nIn 1447 Florence approved a contribution to the restoration of the buildings belonging to the Baths.\nBecause of its location Montecatini was often a battlefield. In fact in 1554 it was the center of the clash between Charles V, allied with Cosimo I, and the Sienese and French militias which, under the command of Pietro Strozzi, were stationed in the castle of Montecatini. As a result, Cosimo had the castle dismantled. \nIn 1529 the owner of the Baths of Montecatini had financial problems so he offered them to Cosimo, who would become Duke in 1532, and Grand Duke, thanks to his nomination by Pope Pius V, in 1569. Since the consort of Cosimo, Eleonora of Toledo, made frequent use of the waters of Montecatini, the Medici had the baths analyzed by their agents. However the proposal did not go through. \nIn 1538 the offer was made again to Francis I, son of Cosimo. However, he had to grant the use of the baths to the citizens of Montecatini. In those years the population and the economy of the Valdinievole grew. However, between 1500 and 1756 there were repeated epidemics because of the flooding of the meadows, forests, fields and pastures, due to the collapse of the bridge at Cappiano. \nDuring their regency the Medici profited from a lot of things including renting farms and fishing. As a result there were lawsuits to defend the residents of the area and to enable them to pay for the reclamation of the padule with the money they recovered. \nIn 1737 the house of Medici became extinct. The great European powers gathered in Vienna in 1738 and agreed that Tuscany would be assigned to Habsburg-Lorraine.\n\nFrancesco I of Lorraine and Maria Teresa of Austria went to Florence in 1739 and stayed there for three months. They then entrusted the government to a Council of Regency that operated until 1765. The Regency tried to resolve promptly the problem of reclaiming the marshes, but the whole thing was more difficult than expected. In those years, epidemics, fevers and famines again appeared. To solve the problem it was necessary to settle the land near the \"padule\" by channeling the springs that were stagnating in the Valdinievole and invigorating the agriculture and livestock. In 1765, with the death of Francesco, Pietro Leopoldo succeeded him assuming the title of Grand Duke, as his mother, Maria Teresa of Austria, had scrupulously prepared him for the responsibilities of reigning. Unfortunately, as a second son, he only inherited the throne in Vienna during the last two years of his life (1790–92). In 1765 he arrived in Tuscany and immediately proved himself open to innovation. During his regency he transformed Palazzo Pitti into the seat of the wisest, most just, humane and progressive government in the Europe of his time. He was also an innovator in the management of the economy, public administration, health and science. As a reformer, he knew how to treat Tuscany as a nation with common values and customs. He went several times to Montecatini to understand first-hand the problems of the Valdinievole and as a result the story of the baths began with the Grand Duke Leopold of Tuscany. He had the territory inspected by great scholars and tried to make the most just and reasonable decisions for it. The Grand Duke went to Montecatini in 1772 and ordered the demolition of the locks and the weirs of Ponte a Cappiano. The channeling of the thermo-mineral waters and the restoration of the City began. Pietro Leopoldo returned many times, even with his family, to Montecatini to check the state of the works. On 1 March 1790 he left Florence to return for Vienna to succeed his brother Josef who had died.\n\nThe third Grand Duke was Ferdinando III who ascended the Tuscan throne when he was only 21 years old. He did not have a very easy reign because of the Napoleonic restoration and, in the early years of his rule, he followed a neutral line. He was exiled by Napoleon and when he returned to Tuscany he was very active in dealing with the questions that arose after the French domination. He implemented a policy of true tolerance. On 10 June 1817 the Bagni di Montecatini complex passed from Ferdinand to the community and they were given money to keep them efficient. On June 18, 1818 the baths were put under the management of a committee up of esteemed people of the time, including Giuseppe Giusti's father. With this new administration of the baths there were innovations and improvements. When Ferdinand III died, he was succeeded by Leopold II who is remembered for the reclamation work in the Maremma and for the construction of railways and roads. Leopold II also collaborated in the construction of the Locanda Maggiore. The Lorraine period concluded with the Risorgimento and the end of the Grand Duchy occurred in 1859. In 1860 Montecatini came under the Province of Lucca with its headquarters in Montecatini Alto. In 1889, thanks to the international medical congress in Florence, the City commenced activity in the field of thermal medicine. In the same year, the urban project proposed and initiated by Pietro Leopoldo was extended and improved.\n\nOn 16 June 1905 Montecatini Alto and Bagni di Montecatini became autonomous municipal entities. On 28 October 1928 the name of the Bagni di Montecatini was changed to Montecatini Terme. In 1928 the municipality of Montecatini, together with all the other municipalities of the Valdinievole, passed from the province of Lucca to the newly formed province of Pistoia. Between 1904 and 1915 the Torretta and Excelsior establishments were born. Giovannozzi restored the Leopoldine and Tettuccio baths between 1919 and 1928. Mussolini also went to the establishments to see how the funds given by the State for their restoration had been spent and entrusted their administration to Schweiger. In 1958 the State reappropriated the baths, symbolizing a second phase with the reconstruction of the Redi and Excelsior baths. Montecatini in those years was frequented by important persons; nobility and people from the worlds of entertainment and politics. In 1970 the baths remained open all year, but from that moment on there has been a slow decline until today, when the fashion for visiting the spa has clearly diminished. Efforts to relaunch the baths began in the 1990s and the City succeeded in doing this in 2000.\nThe emblem of the municipality is regulated by the Royal Decree of 12 August 1908. It is a truncated shield: the first version is of Montecatini which is blue and mounted on six small Italian hills, supporting two gold lions surrounded by an oval silver shield laden with a red lily, facing each other and holding a red basin; in the second version everything is handled in silver and blue. The motto, also present in the coat of arms and in the banner states: «Salus» (Latin: Health).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristian Dior died in a hotel at Montecatini.\n\nGiuseppe Verdi also lived for over 10 years in the city, benefiting from the local thermal center.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2111524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111524", "title": "Throw-in", "text": "Throw-in\n\nA throw-in is a method of restarting play in a game of football (or soccer) when the ball has exited the side of the field of play. It is governed by Law 15 of The Laws Of The Game.\n\nThe throw-in is taken from the point where the ball crossed the touch-line, either on the ground or in the air, though typically a referee will tolerate small discrepancies between the position where the ball crossed the touch-line and the position of the throw-in. The throw-in is taken by the opponents of the player who last touched the ball before it crossed the touch-line. Opposing players may not approach closer than to the point on the touch-line from which the throw-in is to be taken.\n\nAt the moment of delivering the ball, the thrower must face the field of play. The thrower must have part of each foot on the touchline or on the ground outside the touchline, and use both hands to deliver the ball from behind and over the head.\n\nThe ball becomes in play as soon as it enters the field of play.\n\nA goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in; if a player throws the ball directly into their own goal without any other player touching it, the result is a corner kick to the opposing side. Likewise an offensive goal cannot be scored directly from a throw in; the result, in this case, is a goal kick for the defending team.\n\nA player may not be penalised for an offside offence when receiving the ball directly from a throw-in. Skillful attackers can sometimes take advantage of this rule by getting behind the last defender(s) to receive the throw-in and having a clear path to goal.\n\nThe optimal release angle for attaining maximum distance is about 30 degrees above the horizontal, according to researchers at Brunel University. According to the study, players are able to throw the ball with greater release velocity for lower angles. The optimal angle would be 45 degrees if the release velocity did not depend on the angle of throw, if the ball were thrown from ground level instead of above the head, and if there was not air drag.\n\nIf an opposing player fails to respect the required distance (2 m) before the ball is in play or otherwise unfairly distracts or impedes the thrower, he or she may receive a caution (yellow card) for unsporting behaviour. If the throw-in has already been taken when the referee stops play for this offence, an indirect free kick is awarded.\n\nIf the thrower fails to deliver the ball per the required procedure, or delivers it from a point other than where the ball left the field of play, the throw-in is awarded to the opposing team. This is commonly known as a \"foul throw\", though such throws are not considered fouls.\n\nIt is an infringement for the thrower to touch the ball a second time before it has been touched by another player; this is punishable by an indirect free kick to the opposing team from where the offence occurred, unless the second touch was also a more serious handling offence, in which case it is punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick.\n\nIf a player appears to take a throw-in but suddenly leaves it to a team-mate to take, the player is cautioned for delaying the restart of play. Any player who excessively delays the restart of play is also cautioned.\n\nA goalkeeper cannot handle a ball thrown directly to him or her by a teammate. This cannot be circumvented by the keeper using the feet first before handling the ball. If this infringement occurs within the goalkeeper's penalty area, an indirect free kick is awarded. If the infringement occurs outside the goalkeeper's penalty area, a direct free kick is awarded.\n\nA detailed description of an early predecessor of the throw-in is recorded in the novel \"Tom Brown's School Days\", published in 1857 but based on the author's experiences at Rugby School from 1834 to 1842: Several features of this passages are notable:\nThe 1851 rules of Rugby School describe a similar procedure, except that the ball is thrown in rather than struck or hit; this is the ancestor of the line-out in rugby union: \nSimilar \"throw-in\" laws are found in the Cambridge rules of 1856, the Sheffield rules of 1858, the laws of Melbourne FC (1859), and indeed the original FA laws of 1863 (see below).\n\nOther codes had a kick-in rather than a throw-in. These included the \"Foot-Ball Club\" of Edinburgh (1833), Harrow football (1858), Barnes FC (1862), Blackheath FC (1862), and the later version of the Cambridge rules from November 1863. Some of these laws permitted the ball to be kicked in any direction, while others required that it be perpendicular to the touch-line. At Harrow, the ball could be kicked in by \"any of the bystanders\", as well as any player.\n\nThe Eton field game's rules, as recorded in 1847, specified that a throw-in and a \"bully\" (scrummage) should be used alternately, while its 1857 rules used the bully exclusively.\n\nAt its second meeting, on 10 November 1863, the Football Association agreed that \"when the ball is out of bounds it should be kicked or thrown in straight by the person who should first touch it down\". The first draft of the laws of the game reflected this decision, but the option of a kick-in was removed before the final version of the laws was adopted on 8 December 1863. \n\nThis left the 1863 throw-in law very similar to those of Rugby School and Sheffield described earlier: \nThe throw-in from the 1863 rules features several differences from the throw-in in modern association football:\n\n\nIn 1867, the laws of the Sheffield Football Association awarded the throw-in against the team kicking the ball out of play. In 1868, these Sheffield rules were revised further to award a kick-in instead of a throw-in. It continued to be awarded against the team who kicked the ball into touch, and could now be played in any direction.\n\nIn 1873, Nottingham Forest FC proposed a change in the FA's throw-in law to make it more similar to the Sheffield rule: the throw-in would be awarded against the team who kicked out of play, and it could optionally be replaced by a kick-in. Only part of the suggested change was approved by the FA's meeting: the throw-in would be awarded against the team who kicked the ball out of play, but it could not be replaced by a kick-in. It was still required to be thrown in perpendicular to the touch-line.\n\nAt the FA meetings of 1875 and 1876, the Sheffield clubs attempted to introduce their kick-in into the FA's laws. Both times the change was narrowly rejected after heated debate. Matters came to a head in 1877. At the regular meeting of the FA, in February, the Sheffield Association again proposed its kick-in rule, while Clydesdale FC proposed a compromise rule which retained the throw-in but allowed it to go in any direction. The Sheffield Association agreed to withdraw its own proposal in favour of Clydesdale FC's compromise. However, even this compromise proposal was rejected, \"to the intense regret of those who desired one common code of rules\". This rejection prompted the publication of a pseudonymous letter in \"The Sportsman\" decrying the \"hasty, ill-judged decision ... bringing the Football Association into disrepute\", and denying that it represented \"the general body of [Football] Association players -- even of those in London\". A subsequent extraordinary general meeting of the FA was held on the 17th of April, at which the Clydesdale amendment was reconsidered and passed. As a result of this change in the FA laws, the Sheffield Association held a meeting one week later at which it agreed to abandon its own rules and accept the FA laws.\n\nAs a result of these developments, the throw-in of 1877 looked quite similar to today's: it was awarded against the team who kicked the ball out of play, and it could be thrown in any direction. There was no restriction on the technique by which the ball could be thrown; players would throw the ball great distances using only one arm. It is reported that the England international Norman Bailey was capable of propelling the ball \"from the centre of the ground into the goal mouth\".\n\nThe International Football Conference of December 1882 addressed discrepancies between the laws used by the English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish football associations. One of the topics settled at this conference was the throw-in: the Scottish laws required the ball to be thrown in over the head with two hands, while the English laws, as described above, allowed the ball to be thrown with one hand in any direction. As a result of the conference, the Scottish version of the throw-in law was accepted. This new throw-in law, requiring the ball to be thrown from over the head with two hands, was formally adopted by the FA in 1883.\n\nThe laws of the game have never permitted a goal to be scored directly from a throw-in by the attacking team. In 1882, a change in the laws, introduced by Nicholas Lane Jackson of Finchley FC and Morton Betts of Old Harrovians FC, made it possible to score an own goal directly from a throw-in. This possibility was removed in 1898.\n\nUnder the original laws of 1863, it was not possible to be offside from a throw-in; however, since the ball was required to be thrown in at right-angles to the touch-line, it would have been unusual for a player to gain significant advantage from being ahead of the ball. After the ball was permitted to be thrown in any direction in 1877, the very next year (1878) a new law was introduced to allow a player to be offside from a throw-in. This situation lasted until 1920, when the law was altered to prevent a player being offside from a throw-in.\n\nIn 1895, the thrower was required to \"stand on the touch line\". In 1896, it was clarified that the thrower could have \"any part of both feet on the [touch] line\". In 1925, this was changed to \"both feet on the ground \"outside\" the touch-line\", but in 1932 it reverted to \"both feet \"on or outside\" the touch-line\". In 1937, the requirement was once again changed to \"part of each foot shall be either on or outside the touchline\". In 1960, the wording was further refined to \"part of each foot shall be either on the touch-line or on the ground outside the touch-line\".\n\nIn 1895, the player taking the throw-in was required to face the field of play. In 1965, the ball was required to be thrown from \"behind and over\" the head of the thrower.\n\nSince 2005, opponents have been forbidden from approaching closer than 2 metres to the player taking the throw-in. This change was made because FIFA perceived \"an increasing trend for an opponent to stand immediately in front of the thrower at a throw-in, with his feet virtually on the touch-line\", with the result that \"the thrower is being impeded from completing the throw-in\". There was also a concern about the possibility of \"a confrontational situation developing between both players.\"\n\nSince 1866, the player taking the throw-in has been forbidden to touch the ball again until it has been touched by another player.\n\nIn 1866, players were forbidden from playing the ball before it had touched the ground. This requirement was removed when the Clydesdale throw-in law was adopted in 1877.\n\nIn 1871 a law-change introduced by Wanderers FC forbade players from playing the ball until it had travelled at least six yards. This requirement was dropped when the Scottish throw-in law was adopted in 1883.\n\nIn 1882, an indirect free-kick was awarded for any violation of the throw-in law. In 1931, on a proposal by the Irish Football Association, this was changed to an award of the throw-in the opposing team (except for a violation of the double-touch rule, which remained punishable by an indirect free-kick).\n\nIn 1966, it was specified that opponents who \"dance about or gesticulate in a way calculated to distract or impede the thrower\" should be cautioned for ungentlemanly conduct. In 1997, this wording was updated to punish with a yellow card an opponent who \"unfairly distracts or impedes the thrower\" for \"unsporting behaviour\". In 2016, the same punishment was applied to an opponent who approaches closer than the minimum 2 metre distance; it was further specified than an indirect free-kick must be awarded if the ball has already been thrown in when the referee stops play to deal with the offence.\n\nThe name \"throw-in\" is first found in the laws of 1891.\n\nRory Delap was highlighted for his throw-in technique: a former schoolboy javelin champion, Delap was renowned for having one of the longest and most powerful throw-ins in football, sending the ball into the six-yard box from distances up to .\nAn uncommon but effective technique for delivering a faster than usual throw is the flip throw (notably employed in recent years by, among others, Estonian player Risto Kallaste, and Icelander Steinthor Freyr Thorsteinsson): in it the player, during the run-up, plants the ball on the ground, flips over it, and uses the momentum gained from the flip to increase the velocity of the ball. In the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" the Danish player Thomas Grønemark is recorded to have made a throw-in of . Iranian defender Milad Mohammadi made a failed attempt at a flip throw in the group-stage match against Spain at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\n"}
{"id": "2111538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111538", "title": "Stanley Mosk", "text": "Stanley Mosk\n\nMorey Stanley Mosk (September 4, 1912 – June 19, 2001) was an Associate Justice of the California Supreme Court for 37 years (1964–2001), and holds the record for the longest-serving justice on that court. Before sitting on the Supreme Court, he served as Attorney General of California and as a trial court judge, among other governmental positions. Mosk was the last Justice of the California Supreme Court to have served in non-judicial elected office before his appointment to the bench. The Los Angeles County Courthouse is named after him.\n\nMosk was born in San Antonio, Texas. His parents moved when he was three years old, and he grew up in Rockford, Illinois. His parents, Paul and Minna (Perl) Mosk, were Reform Jews (of Hungarian and German origin, respectively) who did not believe in strict religious observances. Since Rockford sits next to the Wisconsin border, Mosk's parents followed Wisconsin politics and were strong supporters of Progressive Wisconsin Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr. Mosk graduated from the University of Chicago in 1933 with a bachelor's degree in philosophy.\n\nMosk's life was strongly affected by the Great Depression. Because his father's business in Rockford was floundering, his parents and brother relocated to Los Angeles, and Mosk followed them after graduating from college, as they could not afford to support him in further studies in Chicago. At the time, it was possible to use the last year of a bachelor's degree as the first year of a three-year law degree program, so while living with his parents, Mosk was able to obtain a law degree in two years. He earned a LL.B from Southwestern University School of Law in 1935 and was admitted to the bar that same year. Thanks to the Depression, no major Los Angeles firms were hiring. Mosk opened his solo practice, and shared an office with four other solos, each maintaining separate practices. During those difficult years, Mosk was a general practitioner who took whatever walked in the door.\n\nWhile practicing law, Mosk occasionally assisted the Democratic politician Culbert Olson with campaigning, and in 1939 was given the job of executive secretary to Olson, the first Democrat elected Governor of California in the 20th-century. During Olson's last days in office, after his defeat for re-election by Republican Earl Warren, he appointed Mosk a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge at the age of 31, the youngest in the state. Mosk faced opposition at his first retention election (California is a modified Missouri Plan state), but prevailed.\n\nIn March 1945, Mosk left the Superior Court to volunteer for service in the U.S. Army during World War II as a private, but spent most of the war in a transportation unit in New Orleans and never went abroad. After honorable discharge in September 1945, he returned to California and resumed his judicial career. On October 18, 1945, actress Ava Gardner married bandleader Artie Shaw at Mosk's house. In 1947, as a Superior Court judge, he declared the enforcement of racial restrictive covenants unconstitutional before the Supreme Court of the United States did so in \"Shelley v. Kraemer\". He also presided over many widely reported cases.\n\nIn 1958, he was elected Attorney General of California by the largest margin of any contested election in the country that year, and was the first person of Jewish descent to serve as a statewide executive branch officer in California. In 1962, he was re-elected by a large margin. He served as the California National Committeeman to the Democratic National Committee and was an early supporter of John F. Kennedy for President. He remained close to the Kennedy family.\n\nAs attorney general for nearly six years, he issued approximately two thousand written opinions, handled a series of landmark cases, and on January 8, 1962, appeared before the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Arizona v. California\".\n\nMosk established the Attorney General's Civil Rights Division and successfully fought to force the Professional Golfers' Association of America to amend its bylaws denying access to minority golfers. He also established Consumer Rights, Constitutional Rights, and Antitrust divisions. As California's chief law enforcement officer, he sponsored legislation creating the California Commission on Peace Officers' Standards and Training (POST).\n\nMosk also commissioned a study of the resurgence of right-wing extremism in California, which famously characterized the secretive John Birch Society as a \"cadre\" of \"wealthy businessmen, retired military officers and little old ladies in tennis shoes.\"\n\nWhile an early favorite to be elected to the United States Senate after the death of incumbent Clair Engle, Mosk was appointed to the California Supreme Court in September 1964 by Governor Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown to succeed the elevated Roger J. Traynor. Mosk was retained by the electorate in 1964, and to three full twelve-year terms from 1974.\n\nAlthough Mosk was a self-described liberal, he often displayed an independent streak that sometimes surprised his admirers and critics alike. For example, in \"Bakke v. Regents of the University of California\", Mosk ruled that the minority admissions program at the University of California, Davis violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. This decision was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Regents of the University of California v. Bakke\", 438 U.S. 265 (1978), which, unlike Mosk's opinion, held that race could be factored in admissions to promote ethnic diversity. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed with Mosk in rejecting racial quotas. He also voted to uphold the constitutionality of a parental consent for abortion law—a law ultimately struck down by a majority of the court.\n\nAlthough personally opposed to the death penalty, Mosk voted to uphold death penalty convictions on a number of occasions. He believed he was obligated to enforce laws properly enacted by the people of the state of California, even though he personally did not approve of such laws. One example of how he articulated his beliefs is his concurrence in \"In re Anderson\", 69 Cal. 2d 613 (1968):\n\nOne of Mosk's contributions to jurisprudence was development of the constitutional doctrine of \"independent state grounds.\" This is the concept that individual rights are not dependent solely on interpretation of the U.S. Constitution by the U.S. Supreme Court and other federal courts, but also can be found in state constitutions, which often provide greater protection for individuals.\n\nAlthough Mosk was widely viewed as a liberal, he was not a close ally of controversial Chief Justice Rose Bird. As a result of that and his independence, he won reelection to the court in 1986 with 75% of the vote while Bird and two other justices closely allied with her were defeated for reelection. In November 1998, at age 86, Mosk was retained by the electorate for another twelve-year term.\n\nMosk served on the high court until his death in 2001, having surpassed Justice John W. Shenk to become the longest-serving justice in the history of the Court in 1999. Mosk authored many significant opinions, some of which have been included in law school casebooks. In 1999, Albany Law School Professor Vincent Martin Bonventre described Mosk as, \"An institution, an icon, a trailblazer, a legal scholar, a constitutional guardian, a veritable living legend of the American judiciary, . . . one of the most influential members in the history of one of the most influential tribunals in the western world.\"\n\nThe Stanley Mosk Courthouse, which is the main civil courthouse of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, is located at 111 North Hill Street in Los Angeles. It is part of the Civic Center complex which includes the County of Los Angeles Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration. The courthouse is often seen in the \"Perry Mason\" TV series, when Perry parks his car on Hill Street to go inside the building.\n\nThe Stanley Mosk Library & Courts Building is located on the Capitol Mall in Sacramento, California and is the home of the California Court of Appeal for the Third District.\n\nA billboard for Mosk's reelection campaign for Attorney General is featured during the final car chase scene in the 1963 film \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\", which was filmed in Long Beach, California in 1962.\n\nMosk married three times. On September 27, 1936, he married Helen Edna Mitchell in Beverly Hills, California, and they had one son, Richard. After her death on May 22, 1981, he remarried on August 27, 1982, to Susan Jane Hines in Reno, Nevada, who was more than 30 years his junior. They divorced and on January 15, 1995, Mosk married Kaygey Kash, a long-time friend.\n\nHis son, Richard M. Mosk, became an attorney and Justice of the California Court of Appeal, Second District.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2111545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111545", "title": "Haworthia", "text": "Haworthia\n\nHaworthia is a large genus of small succulent plants endemic to Southern Africa \n(Mozambique, Namibia, Lesotho, Swaziland and South Africa).\n\nLike the aloes, they are members of the subfamily Asphodeloideae and they generally resemble miniature aloes, except in their flowers, which are distinctive in appearance. They are popular garden and container plants.\n\nHaworthias are small succulent plants, forming rosettes of leaves from to exceptionally in diameter, depending on the species. These rosettes are usually stemless but in some species stems reach up to . \nThe inflorescences of some species may exceed in height. \nThe plants can grow solitary or can be clump-forming. Many species have firm, tough, fleshy leaves, usually dark green in colour, whereas others are softer and contain leaf windows with translucent panels through which sunlight can reach internal photosynthetic tissues. Their flowers are small, and generally white. Though they are very similar between species, flowers from the species in hexangulares generally have green striations and those from other species often have brown lines in the flowers. However, their leaves show wide variations even within one species.\nAdditionally, when the plants are stressed (e.g. deprived of water), their colours can change to reds and purples. Depriving them of nitrogen generally results in paler leaves.\n\nMost species are endemic to South Africa, with the greatest species diversity occurring in the south-western Cape. Some species do however extend into neighbouring territories, in Swaziland, southern Namibia and southern Mozambique (Maputaland).\n\nHaworthia is a genus within the family Asphodelaceae, subfamily Asphodeloideae. The genus is named after the botanist Adrian Hardy Haworth. B. Bayer recognised approximately 60 species in a review of the genus in 2012, whereas other taxonomists are very much less conservative. Related genera are \"Aloe\", \"Gasteria\" and \"Astroloba\" and intergeneric hybrids are known.\nThe classification of the flowering plant subfamily Asphodeloideae is weak, and concepts of the genera are not well substantiated. \"Haworthia\" has been a similarly a weakly contrived genus. Because of their horticultural interest, its taxonomy has been dominated by amateur collectors, and the literature is rife with misunderstanding of what the taxa actually are or should be. Recent phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that the traditional divisions of the genus are actually relatively unrelated (\"Hexangulares\" was shown to be a sister-group of genus \"Gasteria\", \"Robustipedunculares\" more closely related to genus \"Astroloba\", and \"Haworthia\" as an out-group related to \"Aloe\"). In recognition of the polyphyletic nature of the genus, \"Haworthiopsis\" and \"Tulista\" have been split off.\n\nBotanists had long noticed differences in the flowers the three subgenera, but had previously considered those differences to be inconsequential, although the differences between species in the same subgenus definitely are. The roots, leaves and rosettes do demonstrate some generic differences while wide variations occur even within one species.\n\nMany species of \"Haworthia\" have been moved to \"Haworthiopsis\" and \"Tulista\", in particular since the last update of The Plant List (2013), which contains about 150 accepted species of \"Haworthia\". The actual number and identification of the species is not well established; many species are listed as \"unresolved\" for lack of sufficient information, and the full list reflects the difficulties of \"Haworthia\" taxonomy, including many varieties and synonyms. The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families has been updated to exclude the species now in \"Haworthiopsis\" and \"Tulista\". The species it accepts are listed below, excluding \"Haworthia kingiana\" and \"Haworthia minor\", placed in \"Tulista\" by other sources.\n\n\nThere is widespread special collector interest, and some species such as \"Haworthia cymbiformis\" are fairly common house and garden plants.\n\nAlmost all \"Haworthia\" species are naturally adapted for semi-shade conditions (in habitat they tend to grow under bushes or rock overhangs) and they are therefore healthiest in shade or semi-shade. Some species like \"Haworthia pumila\" and \"Haworthia truncata\" can be adapted to tolerate full-sun however.\n\nAll \"Haworthia\" species favour extremely well-drained soil (in habitat they tend to grow in poor sands, in rocky areas). Watering depends on the species (winter or summer rainfall) but most of the common species are tolerant of a variety of watering routines. Over-watering can cause the roots to rot. Rarer species may have more specific requirements.\n\n\"Haworthia\" species reproduce both through seed and through budding, or offsets. Certain species or clones may be more successful or rapid in offset production, and these pups are easily removed to yield new plants once a substantial root system has developed on the offshoot. Less reliably, the plants may also be propagated through leaf cuttings, and in some instances, through tissue culture.\n\n"}

United States, 325 U.S. 1 (1945), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States reviewed the conviction of Anthony Cramer, a German-born naturalized citizen, for treason.\n\nAnthony Cramer, a German-born mechanic, had associated with two Germans, Werner Thiel and Edward Kerling, one of whom he had prior business dealings with. The two were later found to be in the United States for the purpose of sabotage, as part of Operation Pastorius (see \"Ex parte Quirin\"). In the aftermath of the failure of that operation, Cramer was also arrested and convicted on the basis of this association. Judge Henry W. Goddard set his prison term at 45 years, along with a fine of $10,000.\n\nCramer appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, where his conviction was upheld.\n\nAppealing to the court of last resort, the Supreme Court, Cramer was granted certiorari on November 8, 1943.\n\nThe case was originally argued on March 9, 1944; reargued on November 6, 1944; and finally decided on April 23, 1945.\n\nBefore the Supreme Court, Harold Medina appeared as the lawyer for Cramer, while Solicitor General Charles Fahy defended the actions of the government.\n\nThe Court decided five-to-four to overturn the jury verdict. Writing for the majority, Justice Robert H. Jackson said that the constitution is clear in its definition of treason, limited to the waging of war, or giving material assistance to an enemy. The prosecution and its witnesses could demonstrate only an association and not that Cramer had given \"Aid and Comfort,\" as defined in Article Three. Jackson wrote that the jury had been given no evidence that Cramer had \"even paid for their drinks.\" As such, the majority opinion held, the associations were insufficient to convict Cramer for treason, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals was reversed.\n\nWriting in dissent, Justice William O. Douglas claimed that acts, though innocent by nature, may serve a treasonous plan. Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone concurred with the dissent.\n\n\n"}

The Prim, which joins the Neckar (a tributary of the Rhine) in Rottweil, passes through Aldingen.\n\nBalgheim is bordered by the city of Rottweil as well as Frittlingen to the north, Denkingen to the east, the city of Spaichingen to the south, and the city of Trossingen, as well as Deisslingen in the district Rottweil, to the west.\n\nThe ending of the town name (-ingen) indicates that Aldingen has its roots in the territory of Alamannia. During the restoration of the Protestant Mauritius church, archaeological research resulted in the discovery of evidence that allows the origins of the town to be traced back to the 4th century AD. In addition, post holes dating back to around 700 AD were uncovered. In the late 11th century, this wooden church was replaced by one built of stone.\n\nThe town was first mentioned in official documents in 802 in a deed of gift of the Abbey of Saint Gall. In 1444 Aldingen joined the Duchy of Württemberg, and became Protestant during the Reformation.\n\nAldingen belongs to the Amt Spaichingen.\n\nAldingen is located on the Gäubahn, and, after having been discontinued as a stop in 1977, again became a train station in 2003 with the establishment of the Ringzug. The station is one of the most successful stops on the Ringzug route, with in excess of 1,000 passengers using the station on a weekday.\n\nThe Bundesstraße 14 (federal highway) between Rottweil and Tuttlingen passes through the eastern portion of Aldingen. Landstrassen and Kreisstrassen (county and district roads) connect the town with Denkingen, Frittlingen, and Trossingen, which are also utilized by successful bus connections from the train station.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2111565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111565", "title": "Khanty language", "text": "Khanty language\n\nKhanty (or Hanti), previously known as Ostyak (), is the Uralic language spoken by the Khanty people. It is spoken in Khanty–Mansi and Yamalo-Nenets autonomous okrugs as well as in Aleksandrovsky and Kargosoksky districts of Tomsk Oblast in Russia. According to the 1994 Salminen and Janhunen study, there were 12,000 Khanty-speaking people in Russia.\n\nThe Khanty language has many dialects. The western group includes the Obdorian, Ob, and Irtysh dialects. The eastern group includes the Surgut and Vakh-Vasyugan dialects, which, in turn, are subdivided into thirteen other dialects. All these dialects differ significantly from each other by phonetic, morphological, and lexical features to the extent that the three main \"dialects\" (northern, southern and eastern) are mutually unintelligible. Thus, based on their significant multifactorial differences, Eastern, Northern and Southern Khanty could be considered separate but closely related languages.\n\nCyrillic (version as of 2000)\n\nCyrillic (version as of 1958)\n\nLatin (1931–1937)\n\nThe Khanty written language was first created after the October Revolution on the basis of the Latin script in 1930 and then with the Cyrillic alphabet (with the additional letter for ) from 1937.\n\nKhanty literary works are usually written in three Northern dialects, Kazym, Shuryshkar, and Middle Ob. Newspaper reporting and broadcasting are usually done in the Kazymian dialect.\n\nKhanty is divided in three main dialect groups, which are to a large degree mutually unintelligible, and therefore best considered three languages: Northern, Southern and Eastern. Individual dialects are named after the rivers they are or were spoken on. Southern Khanty is probably extinct by now.\nThe Salym dialect can be classified as transitional between Eastern and Southern (Honti:1998 suggests closer affinity with Eastern, Abondolo:1998 in the same work with Southern). The Atlym and Nizyam dialects also show some Southern features.\n\nSouthern and Northern Khanty share various innovations and can be grouped together as Western Khanty. These include loss of full front rounded vowels: *üü, *öö, *ɔ̈ɔ̈ > *ii, *ee, *ää (but *ɔ̈ɔ̈ > *oo adjacent to *k, *ŋ), loss of vowel harmony, fricativization of *k to /x/ adjacent to back vowels, and the loss of the *ɣ phoneme.\n\nA general feature of all Khanty varieties is that while long vowels are not distinguished, a contrast between plain vowels (e.g. ) vs. reduced or extra-short vowels (e.g. ) is found. This corresponds to an actual length distinction in Khanty's close relative Mansi. According to scholars who posit a common Ob-Ugric ancestry for the two, this was also the original Proto-Ob-Ugric situation.\n\nPalatalization of consonants is phonemic in Khanty, as in most other Uralic languages. Retroflex consonants are also found in most varieties of Khanty.\n\nKhanty word stress is usually on the initial syllable.\n\n19 consonants are reconstructed for Proto-Khanty, listed with the traditional UPA transcription shown above and an IPA transcription shown below.\n\nA major consonant isogloss among the Khanty varieties is the reflexation of the lateral consonants, *ɬ (from Proto-Uralic *s and *š) and *l (from Proto-Uralic *l and *ð). These generally merge, however with varying results: /l/ in the Obdorsk and Far Eastern dialects, /ɬ/ in the Kazym and Surgut dialects, and /t/ elsewhere. The Vasjugan dialect still retains the distinction word-initially, having instead shifted *ɬ > /j/ in this position. Similarly, the palatalized lateral *ľ developed to /lʲ/ in Far Eastern and Obdorsk, /ɬʲ/ in Kazym and Surgut, and /tʲ/ elsewhere. The retroflex lateral *ḷ remains in Far Eastern, but in /t/-dialects develops into a new plain /l/.\n\nOther dialect isoglosses include the development of original *ć to a palatalized stop /tʲ/ in Eastern and Southern Khanty, but to a palatalized sibilant /sʲ ~ ɕ/ in Northern, and the development of original *č similarly to a sibilant /ʂ/ (= UPA: ) in Northern Khanty, partly also in Southern Khanty.\n\nThe Vakh dialect is divergent. It has rigid vowel harmony and a tripartite (ergative–accusative) case system: The subject of a transitive verb takes the instrumental case suffix \"-nə-\", while the object takes the accusative case suffix. The subject of an intransitive verb, however, is not marked for case and might be said to be \"absolutive\". The transitive verb agrees with the subject, as in nominative–accusative systems.\n\nVakh has the richest vowel inventory, with four reduced vowels and full . Some researchers also report .\n\nNotes:\n\nThe Kazym dialect distinguishes 18 consonants.\nThe vowel inventory is much simplified. Eight vowels are distinguished in initial syllables: four full and four reduced . In unstressed syllables, four values are found: .\n\nA similarly simple vowel inventory is found in the Nizyam, Sherkal, and Berjozov dialects, which have full and reduced . Aside from the full vs. reduced contrast rather than one of length, this is identical to that of the adjacent Sosva dialect of Mansi.\n\nThe Obdorsk dialect has retained full close vowels and has a nine-vowel system: full vowels and reduced vowels ). It however has a simpler consonant inventory, having the lateral approximants /l lʲ/ in place of the fricatives /ɬ ɬʲ/ and having fronted to /s n/.\n\nThe nominal suffixes include dual ', plural ', dative ', locative/instrumental '.\n\nFor example:\n\nSingular, dual, and plural possessive suffixes may be added to singular, dual, and plural nouns, in three persons, for 3 = 27 forms. A few, from \"məs\" \"cow\", are:\n\nThe personal pronouns are, in the nominative case:\nThe cases of \"ma\" are accusative \"manət\" and dative \"manəm\".\n\nThe demonstrative pronouns and adjectives are:\n\nBasic interrogative pronouns are:\n\nKhanty numerals, compared with Hungarian and Finnish, are:\nThe formation of multiples of ten shows Slavic influence in Khanty, whereas Hungarian uses the collective derivative suffix \"-van (-ven)\" closely related to the suffix of the adverbial participle which is \"-va (-ve)\" today but used to be \"-ván (-vén)\". Note also the regularity of \"house\" and \"hundred\".\n\nBoth Khanty and Mansi are basically nominative–accusative languages but have innovative morphological ergativity. In an ergative construction, the object is given the same case as the subject of an intransitive verb, and the locative is used for the agent of the transitive verb (as an instrumental) . This may be used with some specific verbs, for example \"to give\": the literal Anglicisation would be \"by me (subject) a fish (object) gave to you (indirect object)\" for the equivalent of the sentence \"I gave a fish to you\". However, the ergative is a morphological (marked using a case) only, not syntactic, so that, in addition, these may be passivized in a way resembling English. For example, in Mansi, \"a dog (agent) bit you (object)\" could be reformatted as \"you (object) were bitten, by a dog (instrument)\".\n\nKhanty is an agglutinative language and employs an SOV order.\n\nThe lexicon of the Khanty varieties is documented relatively well. The most extensive early source is Toivonen (1948), based on field records by K. F. Karjalainen from 1898–1901. An etymological interdialectal dictionary, covering all known material from pre-1940 sources, is Steinitz et al. (1966–1993).\n\nSchiefer (1972) summarizes the etymological sources of Khanty vocabulary, as per Steinitz et al., as follows:\n\nFutaky (1975) additionally proposes a number of loanwords from the Tungusic languages, mainly Evenki.\n\n\n"}

George attended primary school and graduated to secondary classes in the neighboring village of Telcs (\"now: Telciu\"). He happily took to the scholarly bent encouraged by his father, earning the praise of instructors and being chosen among the few who were to sign up for advanced courses at \"Liceul Românesc\" (Romanian Lyceum), a higher learning academy in the town of Naszód (\"now: Năsăud\"). He soon found himself doubling as teacher.\n\nHe began tearing through the library of the institution, impressing colleagues with his encyclopedic inclinations, and joined a local literary club, the \"Virtus Romana Rediviva\", an association his father frowned upon as a deviation for a prospective career as clergyman. In 1884, already a well-loved teacher at the age of 24, he published his very first poems in the yearly almanac of the literary club.\n\nCoşbuc began attending courses at the University of Cluj-Napoca in 1884, while collecting fairy tales and popular stories, which he rewrote and published to local success. He became so popular that three years later, he was asked to become editor in chief of the main Kolozsvár Romanian newspaper, \"Tribuna\".\nHe soon published what widely became known as his first masterpiece, \"Nunta Zamfirei\" (\"Zamfira's Wedding\") to enthusiastic praise in Romanian literary circles. He moved to Romania, Bucharest, the capital, and the center of cultural discourse. His contributes to the periodical \"Convorbiri Literare\" to consistent acclaim. In collaboration with other former educators, he pieced together a praised Romanian language textbook: \"Carte românească de citire\" (the \"Romanian Book of Reading\").\n\nIn 1893, he published \"Balade și idile\" (\"Ballads and Pastorals\") a volume which cemented his reputation. He began dabbling in poetry with political subtext, penning the emphatic \"Noi vrem pământ\" (\"We Demand Land\"), \"Lupta vieții\" (\"Life's struggle\"), and overviewes the debut of yet another literary magazine, \"Vatra\". In 1895, he married Elena Sfetea.\n\nHe completed the first Romanian translation of Virgil's \"Aeneid\" in 1896, and also published a collection of various poems and short stories, \"Versuri și proză\" (\"Verses and Prose\"). His output as a translator is astonishing: within the span of three years, he published large portions of Kalidassa's Sanskrit \"Abhignānashākuntala\" (a part of them through German translations), and a new Romanian translation of Homer's \"Odyssey\". Coşbuc also undertook the translation of various works by Friedrich Schiller. The Romanian Academy deemed him an \"\"outstanding member\"\" in 1898. He further contributed to literature by completing, a decade later, the epic effort of translating Dante Aligheri's \"Divine Comedy\" in its entirety.\n\nIn December 1901, he joined Alexandru Vlahuță in founding and, until 1905, editing the influential magazine \"Sămănătorul\", a traditionalist publication appealing to those intellectuals who could claim peasant roots. After more than a decade of tremendous success as an author, he experienced personal tragedy in 1915, when his only son, Alexandru, died in a car accident. Heartbroken, Coșbuc ceased all work. He is buried at Bellu cemetery.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2111579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111579", "title": "Dropped-ball", "text": "Dropped-ball\n\nA dropped-ball (or drop-ball) is a method of restarting play in a game of association football. It is used when play has been stopped due to reasons other than normal gameplay, fouls, or misconduct. The situations requiring a dropped-ball restart are outlined in Law 8 and Law 9 of the Laws of the Game; Law 8 also contains the dropped-ball procedure.\n\nA drop-ball is used to restart play when the referee has stopped play for any reason not listed for another form of restart. Examples include when play has been stopped due to serious injury to a player, interference by an external party, or a ball becoming defective.\n\nLaw 9 provides for a dropped-ball restart if the ball touches a match official, remains on the field of play, and any of the following occur:\n\nIn games which use video assistant referees (VAR), if a VAR review determines that play should not have been stopped, such as when a decision to award a penalty is reversed, play is restarted with a dropped ball at the point of the incorrect call.\n\nFollowing changes to the Laws of the Game effective from June 2019, the dropped ball is explicitly awarded to a specific player:\n\n\nThe ball is dropped by the referee at the point where the ball was last touched by a player, official, or outside agent, unless this is within the penalty area (or the ball was in the penalty area when play was stopped), in which case the ball is dropped within the penalty area.\nAll players of either side, other than the designated player, must be away from the ball until it touches the ground.\n\nThe ball becomes in play as soon as it touches the ground. No player may touch the ball until it has touched the ground.\nIf the ball leaves the field of play before it has been touched by a player (including if the ball enters either goal), the drop-ball is retaken.\n\nIf a player touches the ball before it touches the ground, the drop-ball is retaken. If a player persistently touches the ball before it touches the ground, and the referee believes that the player is deliberately doing so, this may be considered misconduct and the referee may caution the player with a yellow card for delaying the restart of play.\n\nA goal may not be scored from a dropped ball until it has been touched by two different players. If the ball enters either goal without having been touched by two players, the result is a goal-kick or corner-kick.. A dropped ball is the only restart which allows the first player who touches the ball to touch it a second time without penalty. \n\nIn 1888, a new law was added to the rules of association football allowing the referee to restart the game after a temporary suspension of play by \"throwing up the ball at the spot where play was suspended\". The ball could not be played until it had touched the ground. In 1905, the referee was instructed to \"throw the ball down\" rather than up, and in 1914, to \"drop the ball\".\n\nIn 1984, a special case was added for a dropped ball within the goal area; instead of being dropped at the point where play was suspended, the ball would be dropped at the closest point on the six-yard line. This change was made in order to avoid \"crowding\" and \"jostling\". \n\nIn 2012, scoring a goal directly from a dropped ball was forbidden (if the dropped ball was kicked directly into the goal, a goal-kick or corner-kick was awarded instead). The justification given by the Football Association for this change was that \"[t]here have been a number of occasions where goals have been scored from 'uncontested' dropped balls ... We then have the unseemly situation where the opposition allows the team to score from the kick-off without any players trying to stop them in order to rebalance the game.\"\n\nIn 1891, an infringement of the laws at a dropped ball (for example, playing the ball before it touched the ground) was punished with an indirect free kick to the opposition. This penalty was removed in 1937, and replaced with a retake.\n\nIn 2019, the contested dropped ball was abolished. The dropped ball still took place, but was awarded to:\n\n\nAll other players, of both teams, were required to be at least 4 metres from the ball until it touched the ground.\n\nBefore 2019, any number of players from either side were allowed to contest a dropped ball. However, this rarely occurred, as many players sportingly elected to kick the ball out of play when an event requiring the stoppage of play – most often an injury – occurred. Contested drop balls became exceedingly rare in the modern game. After the situation had been resolved, the opposing team typically, but not always, conceded possession to the other team after returning the ball into play via the throw-in, as a gesture of good sportsmanship. when the referee did stop play and a dropped ball occurred, a similar return of possession was almost always made from the restart, with the ball being kicked back to the original possessors' defence. \n\nThe official justification given for this change was that \"[t]he [previous] dropped ball procedure often leads to a ‘manufactured’ restart which is ‘exploited’ unfairly (e.g. kicking the ball out for a throw-in deep in the opponents’ half) or an aggressive confrontation. Returning the ball to the team that last played it (had possession) restores what was ‘lost’ when play was stopped, except in the penalty area where it is simpler to return the ball to the goalkeeper. To prevent that team gaining an unfair advantage, all players of both teams, except the player receiving the ball, must be at least 4 m (4.5 yds) away.\"\n\nThe 2019 rule change also provided for a dropped ball restart for certain situations involving the ball touching a match official. Previously, the match officials were considered part of the field and play continued if the ball touched an official regardless of the result, unless the ball went out of play for a different reason such as going out of bounds. The rule change allows the referee to stop play and award a dropped ball if either team gains an advantage from the ball touching an official. The official explanation for this change was that \"[i]t can be very unfair if a team gains an advantage or scores a goal because the ball has hit a match official, especially the referee\".\n"}

A serious problem can arise in the sliding window operation when the sending application program creates data slowly, the receiving application program consumes data slowly, or both. If a server with this problem is unable to process all incoming data, it requests that its clients reduce the amount of data they send at a time (the window setting on a TCP packet). If the server continues to be unable to process all incoming data, the window becomes smaller and smaller, sometimes to the point that the data transmitted is smaller than the packet header, making data transmission extremely inefficient. The name of this problem is due to the window size shrinking to a \"silly\" value.\n\nSince there is a certain amount of overhead associated with processing each packet. The increased number of packets means increased overhead to process a decreasing amount of data. The end result is thrashing.\n\nWhen there is no synchronization between the sender and receiver regarding capacity of the flow of data or the size of the packet, the window syndrome problem is created. When the silly window syndrome is created by the sender, Nagle's algorithm is used. Nagle's solution requires that the sender send the first segment even if it is a small one, then that it wait until an ACK is received or a maximum sized segment (MSS) is accumulated.\nWhen the silly window syndrome is created by the receiver, David D Clark's solution is used. Clark's solution closes the window until another segment of maximum segment size (MSS) can be received or the buffer is half empty.\n\nThere are 3 causes of SWS:\n\n\nDuring SWS, efficiency of communication is almost 0, so SWS duration should be short as possible.\n\nA heuristic method where the send TCP must allow the sending application to make \"write\" calls, and collect the data transferred in each call before transmitting it into a large segment. The sending TCP delays sending segments until it can accumulate reasonable amounts of data, which is known as \"clumping.\"\n\nA heuristic method that a receiver uses to maintain an internal record of the available window, and delay advertising an increase in window size to the sender until it can advance a significant amount. This amount depends on the receiver's buffer size and maximum segment size. By using this method, it prevents small window advertisements where received applications extract data octets slowly.\n\n\n"}

Most of the vehicles displayed are from the collection of the late casino owner William F. Harrah, and so the museum is sometimes referred to as The Harrah Collection. The museum opened in 1989.\n\nWilliam F. Harrah had collected approximately 1,450 automobiles, which he stored inside warehouses in Sparks, Nevada. It was the world's largest collection of historic automobiles, and was opened to the public. When Harrah died in 1978, Holiday Inn acquired his hotel-casino company and the automobile collection. In 1981, Holiday Inn announced that it would sell the entire collection, a decision that received some opposition. Nevada governor Robert List attempted to delay the sale while working on a plan to have the state enact legislation that would save the collection. Businessman Thomas Perkins later led a group that was interested in purchasing the collection. Both efforts to save the collection failed. However, a nonprofit organization was formed that ultimately resulted in the construction of the museum. Holiday Inn donated 175 of Harrah's automobiles to the group, while the remainder of his collection was sold during three auctions in the mid-1980s. Another 60 vehicles were donated to the group by private owners. The museum opened in 1989, in downtown Reno, Nevada.\n\nThe museum's holdings of over 200 cars are spread over four galleries.

As characters from \"St. Elsewhere\" have appeared on other television shows and those shows' characters appeared on more shows, and so on, a \"Tommy Westphall Universe\" hypothesis (postulated by Dwayne McDuffie) argues that a significant amount of fictional episodic television exists within a fictional universe imagined by Tommy Westphall.\n\nIn the last episode's final two scenes, Donald Westphall — having just returned to St. Eligius — is shown in Dr. Auschlander's office pondering the recent death from stroke of his colleague and mentor. With the aria \"\"Chi il bel sogno di Doretta\"\" (Doretta's Beautiful Dream) from Puccini's opera \"La Rondine\" playing, Tommy Westphall enters the office and runs to the window, where he looks at the snow falling outside St. Eligius. An exterior camera shot of the hospital cuts to Tommy Westphall sitting in the living room of an apartment building alongside his grandfather, now being portrayed by Norman Lloyd (aka \"Daniel Auschlander\"). Tommy's father, still being portrayed by Ed Flanders (aka \"Donald Westphall\") arrives at the apartment wearing a hard hat. The following exchange occurs:\n\nTommy, who is shaking a snow globe, is told by his father to come and wash his hands. As they leave the living room, Tommy's father places the snow globe upon a television set. The camera slowly zooms in on the snow globe, which is revealed to contain a replica of St. Eligius hospital inside of it.\n\nThe foremost interpretation of this scene is that the entire series of events in \"St. Elsewhere\" were dreamt by Tommy Westphall, and thus, products of his imagination. According to Lindsey Freeman, the narrative framing of Tommy's imagination as within a snow globe occurs because, as an \"oneiric and mnemonic gadget,\" a snow globe \"often finds itself as a companion piece to the dream sequences found in television and movies,\" adding that, \"while a controversial and maddening ending for some loyal viewers, the final episode of \"St. Elsewhere\" illustrates the rich and often blurred boundaries in how we experience the world.\"\n\nThe Tommy Westphall universe hypothesis makes the claim that not only does \"St. Elsewhere\" take place within Tommy's mind, but so do numerous other television series which are directly and indirectly connected to \"St. Elsewhere\" through fictional crossovers and spin-offs, resulting in a large fictional universe taking place entirely within Tommy's mind. This hypothesis was originally put forward by comic book and TV writer Dwayne McDuffie in a 2002 blog post, as a \"reductio ad absurdum\" argument \"against\" making strong statements about fictional continuity based upon guest appearances.\n\nIn a 2003 article published on BBC News Online, \"St. Elsewhere\" writer Tom Fontana was quoted as saying \"Someone did the math once... and something like 90 percent of all [American] television took place in Tommy Westphall's mind. God love him.\"\n\nThe \"St. Elsewhere\" characters Dr. Roxanne Turner (Alfre Woodard) and Dr. Victor Ehrlich (Ed Begley, Jr.) appeared on \"\". Fontana was the executive producer and showrunner for \"Homicide\" for its entire seven years.\n\nProponents of the Tommy Westphall Universe argue that because of this fictional crossover, the two series exist within the same fictional universe, and within Tommy Westphall's mind because of the final episode of \"St. Elsewhere\"; by extension this hypothesis can be extended to include the science fiction program \"The X-Files\" and the \"Law & Order\" franchise (due to various crossovers with characters from \"Homicide\", in particular Det. John Munch).\n\nThere are other possible interpretations of Tommy's \"vision\" which may suggest something other than the entire series being his dream. For instance, it may be the other way around, and the snow globe scene may itself be the dream. Brian Weatherson, professor of philosophy at Cornell University, wrote a piece, \"Six Objections to the Westphall Hypothesis\", which challenges the logical, factual, and philosophical basis for the existence of the \"universe\".\n\nWeatherson's fifth objection holds that the appearance of a person or event in a dream does not mean the person or event cannot exist in real life. If a person dreams about visiting London and meeting Gordon Brown, it does not follow that because the city of London and Gordon Brown appeared in a dream, they do not exist in real life. Specific to the Westphall Hypothesis, even if we accept that \"St. Elsewhere\" is Westphall's dream, it does not imply that all of the characters on the show exist only in his mind. Therefore, appearances from \"St. Elsewhere\" characters on other shows are not sufficient to indicate that those shows exist only in Westphall's dream.\n\nThe notion that appearances by the same character in two or more series tie those series together in the same fictional universe is also problematic. Weatherson, in his sixth objection, offers the example of Michael Bloomberg playing the role of New York City Mayor both on \"Law & Order\" and in real life, which, if one accepts the logic of the hypothesis, indicates that real life is in the head of Tommy Westphall. Thus, it does not follow that because one person, place, or thing is present in two or more works of fiction that those works are necessarily related.\n\nWhen directing episodes for the eighth series of the revived \"Doctor Who\" in 2014, Ben Wheatley had the art department create a replica of Tommy Westphall's snowglobe, which Wheatley placed in the TARDIS set as a reference to the hypothesis.\n\nNewsRadio episode \"Daydream\" (season 3 episode 7) ends with Jimmy James staring into a snow globe that appears to contain a miniature version of the WNYX office, thus seeming to indicate that Jimmy James has imagined the entire episode.\n\n\n"}

The nest is tubular, wider at the top, and with the entrance at its base. It is made of plant material and attached to a branch or a vertical surface. In the latter case, the entire length is fixed to the wall or trunk. Two or three white eggs are laid on a shelf in the upper part of the nest, and incubated by both parents.\n\nThe lesser swallow-tailed swift is a slender species, 12.7–13 cm long, and weighing 18 g. It has long narrow wings and a long forked tail, which is usually held tightly closed. It is mainly black with a white throat and upper breast and squarish white patches on the rear flanks. The sexes are similar.\n\nThe flight is very fast and dashing, although it will glide at height in a more leisurely fashion. The flight call is a high-pitched ', replaced at the nest by a chattering '.\n\nThe northern race \"P. c. veraecrucis\", which breeds from Mexico to northern Honduras is similar to the nominate \"P. c. cayennensis\", but slightly larger.\n\nThe lesser swallow-tailed swift feeds in flight on flying insects, especially winged ants. It is less gregarious than other swifts and is usually seen as individuals or pairs. If other swift species are present it will normally feed above them, although it stays below \"Cypseloides\" species such as chestnut-collared swift.\n\nThe bird is part of the folklore of Central and Northwestern South American countries (where it is known as \"pajaro macuá\"), and magical or mystical properties are attributed either to its song or its nest.\n\n\n"}

The game was invented by former NASA employee Bob Doyle, his wife Holly, and brother-in-law Wendl Thomis. Merlin is notable as one of the earliest and most popular handheld games, selling over 5 million units during its initial run, as well as one of the most long-lived, remaining popular throughout the 1980s. A version of the game was re-released in 2004 by the Milton Bradley Company.\n\nMerlin has the form of a rectangular device about nine and a half inches long and three inches wide. The play area of the game consists of a matrix of 11 buttons; each button contains a red LED. The array is encased in a red plastic housing, bearing a slight resemblance to an overgrown touch-tone telephone. Four game-selection and control buttons are also placed at the bottom of the unit; a speaker takes up the top section. Supporting electronics (including a simple microprocessor) are contained within the shell of the game. Parker Brothers later released Master Merlin with more games, and the rarer Split Second, where all games involve time with a more advanced display, having line segments around the dots. Both of these shared the same general case shape and came out a few years after Merlin.\n\nMerlin's simple array of buttons and lights supported play of six different games, some of which could be played against the computer or against another person. The games that can be selected are:\n\n\nThe \"music machine\" game functions as a musical instrument; in this mode, each key is assigned a musical note, and sequences of notes can be recorded and played back. This makes Merlin one of the earliest digital sequencers as well as an early consumer-level electronic synthesizer.\n\nIn 1978, Merlin appeared with Milton Bradley's Simon on the cover of the Christmas issue of \"Newsweek\" and the October issue of \"Boston\". \n\nThe Toy Manufacturers of America named Merlin the best selling toy and game item (SKU) in America in 1980 with 2.2 million sold.\n\nIn 1995, Parker Brothers redesigned Merlin, including making it a one-player game with more challenges called \"Merlin: the 10th Quest\". The premise of Merlin was still the same, but for each game completed, an icon was displayed on the screen showing proof of victory. Instead of the six games from the original, there were nine games:\n\n\nIn \"singing sword\", the object is to push the right buttons to make the swords on the screen disappear. Pushing the wrong button will make a sword appear. In \"ghost walk\", directional pads move the ghost towards the center of the screen and destroy it, but the ghost can resist. \"Dragon dance\" involves being surrounded in all directions by dragons. If a dragon appears, it is killed by pressing the directional pad where that dragon is. Each of the three last games keep time.\n\nAfter defeating all nine games, Merlin announces \"Brave knight, the challenge awaits\" and the 10th quest begins. This involves running through a dungeon maze to escape through the exit. The first round of the dungeon is simple, but the second round shows the walls temporarily before vanishing while the third round has invisible walls.\n\nIf the maze is solved in record time, Merlin would say \"Congratulations, you are a master\" and display the time in the dungeon maze.\n\n"}

It is operated by Gloucester County Public Schools, a Virginia public school division.\n\nThe current complex was originally built in 1976, and has been expanded several times since. The current high school facility remains the only high school in the county, even though student numbers have risen steadily since its construction date. The current number of students ranges somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000.\n\nA major addition was built onto the school in 1993 and functions mainly as the school's science wing. It is fully equipped with 3 computer labs, 2 full scale chemistry labs, as well as other classrooms with enough equipment for simple demonstrations. It is known to students and faculty as D-Hall. Included in the expansion was a foreign language hall at the opposite end of the building, built onto A-Hall.\n\nLess extensive renovations have occurred since then, including the office and guidance offices in 2005. Beginning in April 2006, the industrial arts facilities were remodeled into new art rooms by the beginning of the following school year, freeing up the previous art rooms for normal classroom use. The old primary art room became the newsroom of the school newspaper, the \"Dukes' Dispatch\". During the summer of 2006, the school's television production facility was updated with new equipment and made into a studio. The school then began producing programming for its own local Public-access television cable TV channel. The most recent renovations were completed in October 2006 and included a $700,000 renovation of the auditorium.\n\nDuring the summer of 2007, Gloucester High began outfitting classrooms with LCD projectors. Most recently, another wing of the school began renovations to add a cardiovascular workout room. The room will include treadmills and other cardiovascular workout machines.\n\nGloucester High School operates on a four by four scheduling structure. The school day begins at 7:45am EDT and ends at 2:46pm EDT. Every day there are four periods that are approximately two hours long, which host one class each period. With one school year containing two semesters, there are 4 classes each semester which total into 8 classes over the course of a year. The exception to this rule are Dual and AP classes which are every other day over the course of a year, with some activities classes also following this rule. There are three lunch blocks, each 25 minutes in length, which take place over the course of the day's third block.\n\nThe facilities of Gloucester High School include:\n\nGloucester High school is in the VHSL Region A Division 5 and plays in the Peninsula District of Virginia.\n\n\n\n\nGloucester High School has been recognized for its drama department.

Past shows include \"South Pacific, Little Shop of Horrors, A Christmas Carol, Grease, Dracula, Footloose, Scheme of a Driftless Shifter, The Wizard of Oz, Anybody for Tea, Dolls, Fiddler on the Roof, Annie,\" Disney's \"High School Musical\", and Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast\". The performances are open for participation by any student at the school (not just those enrolled in theatre classes).\n\nGloucester High School operates a fully functioning dining room called \"Dukes Bistro\".

After about two months, an anonymous complaint was received, and the Gloucester County School Board passed a policy resolution requiring that access to changing rooms and bathrooms \"shall be limited to the corresponding biological genders, and students with gender identity issues shall be provided an alternative appropriate private facility\". When he refused to use the girls' bathroom, the school hastily converted a few broom closets into unisex bathrooms and offered those as an alternative. He refused to use those, opting to use a bathroom in the school nurse's office instead.\n\nGrimm then obtained legal representation from the American Civil Liberties Union and sued the school in federal court. The U.S. Department of Justice agreed to intervene in the case on Grimm's behalf, writing to the court that Title IX \"prohibits discrimination based on sex, including gender identity, transgender status, and nonconformity to sex stereotypes\".\nAfter various rulings and appeals, the dispute escalated to the U.S. Supreme Court, which announced in October 2016 that it would take up the case.\n\n"}

All members were elected at the 1987 election following a double dissolution of both houses of parliament, rather than the normal case of only half of the state senators facing election.\n\nIn accordance with section 13 of the Constitution, following a double dissolution of Parliament, the terms for Senators commence on 1 July preceding the election – i.e., on 1 July 1987. The Senate decides which senators were allocated the full six-year terms ending on 30 June 1993 and which senators were allocated three-year terms ending on 30 June 1990. In 1983 the \"Commonwealth Electoral Act\" 1918 had been amended to include provision for a recount of ballot papers to determine the senators to get the long term vacancies. This was the result of a unanimous recommendation from the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform. Despite the unanimous recommendation for reform, Labor and the Democrats maintained the previous system where the first six senators elected in each state were allocated the full six-year terms ending on 30 June 1993 while the other half were allocated three-year terms ending on 30 June 1990. The effect of this system was that Democrat Senators Paul McLean and Janet Powell got a long term instead of National Senators David Brownhill and Julian McGauran. There was no net effect on Labor and Liberal in that in South Australia, Labor Senator Graham Maguire got a long term instead of Liberal Senator Robert Hill, while in Queensland, Liberal Senator Warwick Parer got a long term instead of Labor Senator Gerry Jones.

It was the last of the three such mountains, or \"amba\", said to have been used for that purpose, the other two being Debre Damo and Amba Geshen.\n\nFrom some undetermined time in history, it was the custom that when the Emperor assumed the throne, his brothers and other male relatives would be taken to a royal prison, where they would live until either they were called forth to become the new emperor or died. Mount Wehni was first used as a prison by Fasilides, when he exiled his son Dawit there for leading a revolt. The mountain was abandoned as a prison during the Zemene Mesafint; more precisely in the 1790s, as Samuel Gobat learned from one Tekla Selassie, \"a relative of the king\" (that is, the Emperor of Ethiopia).\n\nAlthough James Bruce first mentions the existence of the royal prison at Wehni, Thomas Pakenham was the first European to visit the site, in 1955. He notes that when he started to search for this half-forgotten complex, there were three possible locations for the prison in the province of Begemder, now part of the Amhara Region of Ethiopia: the Ethiopian expert Steven Wright believed it lay three days' journey to the west of Gondar; a Colonel Shifferaw, who was familiar with the area, knew of two locations to the east of Gondar. Pakenham's explorations determined that it lay in the mountains to the northeast of Emfraz, and he recorded his first clear view of it:\n\nPakenham found at the foot of the mountain a village that \"hardly deserved the name\". Although he found the inhabitants \"wretched and poor\", inspecting the local church he found a number of paintings that he dated to the 17th century, \"fifty years after Fasil in fact, but were exciting evidence of the importance of Wehni at the time. Though the church and village were now so dilapidated, it was obvious that once they had enjoyed royal patronage as munificent as Gondar itself.\"\n\nUnfortunately, a landslide at some point in the previous 30 years made Pakenham unable to ascend Mount Wehni. Equipped with climbing gear, he made an unsuccessful second attempt a few months later. He concludes his account of travels in Ethiopia with a description of the compound at the top of the mountain, viewed from the air, after he had convinced the pilot of the Gondar-Addis Ababa flight to pass by and circle the peak.\n\nTravel writer Barbara Toy was the first Westerner to set foot on the top of Wehni, which she accessed in 1959 by helicopter. She camped overnight on the mountain, and wrote about her time in Ethiopia in her 1961 book \"In Search of Sheba: Across the Sahara to Ethiopia\", published by John Murray.\n\nMount Wehni was climbed in 2002 by members of the HotRock round the world climbing expedition. It was chronicled in the book \"The Reluctant Traveller\" by Bill Lumley, who joined HotRock for the Ethiopian leg of the journey. The expedition incorrectly claimed that its members were the first known people to be on the summit of the mountain since its use as a prison some 300 years earlier, despite the visit 43 years earlier.\n\nThis royal prison at the top of Wehni left its influence on English literature by the accounts of Bruce and inspired the setting of Dr. Samuel Johnson's narrative \"The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia\".\n"}

Before returning home, he visited the Calgary area and hunted buffalo. This was prior to the initial Fort Calgary settlement, which happened in 1875.\n\nIn 1883, Ramsay returned to Calgary and established several businesses. In the 1885 North-West Rebellion, he was a Government dispatch rider. He served eight total years on the city council as an alderman and was also mayor from January 5, 1904 to January 2, 1905, during which time he was a stringent supporter of municipal ownership, working to establish a lighting and water system for the city.\n\nAfter his retirement in Calgary from his business, he moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where he died in 1942.\n\nThe son of William and Sarah (née Mohr) Ramsay, Silas Alexander Ramsay was born at Aylmer, Quebec in 1850. He attended public schools in his birthplace, completing high school. At the age of nine in 1860, Ramsay would witness the cornerstone lying ceremony of the Canadian Parliament buildings at Parliament Hill. He moved to Almonte, Ontario around 1867 and lived there for three years, when he participated the suppression of the Red River Rebellion in a faction commanded by Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley. During that time he participated in the Wolseley Expedition, travelling through Port Arthur and then embarking westward, in a journey of around three months, to Fort Garry (presently Winnipeg). Being the first trip he undertook Canadian West, he also visited the Calgary area and hunted buffalo, prior to Fort Calgary's establishment in 1875. He would later home via railway through Ottawa after heading through Montana and St. Paul, Minnesota. There he would open up a general store and operate it for around eight years, when he closed up and became a wool merchant for four years.\n\nIntrigued by the opportunity and potential it held, in 1883, Ramsay decided to move west, settling in the village of Calgary, in the Northwest Territories, which was then the terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway. At Calgary he would ranch and enter the agricultural product manufacturing business as an agent for an Ontario company, producing buggies, wagons, plows, and mowers. This was one of the first such businesses in the province of Alberta. He was also an agent for a sewing machine company, with an office located on Stephen Avenue. When the Northwest Rebellion of 1885 broke out, Ramsay would be involved in it, serving as a government dispatch messenger and later a scout. During his rebellion duties, he was attacked in encounter with local First Nations peoples, forcing him to fire shots from his rifle in self-defense. In Calgary he also built the Ramsay Block, on a piece of land, opposite of the city's old post office.\n\nKeenly interested in Calgary's civic politics, Ramsay first served as an alderman on the Calgary City Council from January 7, 1895 to January 3, 1899 and January 6, 1902 to January 5, 1904. A strong supporter of public ownership of utilities, he also served a stint as Chairman of the council's Water and Light Committee, in which he oversaw the installation of the city's first electric lighting system, as well as the purchase of the water system by the municipality from a private company. He was later lauded for this action by the \"Calgary Albertan\", who stated that it had helped set the foundations the municipal utility system that was later established and improved upon of Calgary. He was an Independent.\n\nOn December 7, 1903, municipal nominations day for the upcoming election, Ramsay was acclaimed as mayor of Calgary, with no opposing nominees for the office. Ramsay served as mayor until January 5, 1905, when he was succeeded by John Emerson. During his term, the city moved to establish a numbering system for its streets, and the Canadian Pacific Railway initiated an irrigation project east of the city, which would later become Chestermere Lake, Alberta. He did not seek re-election as mayor in the 1904 election, instead accepting a nomination to once again serve as alderman. He was later elected and would serve a final aldermanic term, from January 2, 1905 to January 14, 1907. He later retired from his business around 1921 and moved to Vancouver.\n\nRamsay married Jessie Ann Wilson in Alamonte on April 18, 1876. Together they had four children: Bertha Maud, Robert Wilson, Charles Henry, and Percival Clod. One of his brothers served as mayor of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. He was active member of the Calgary Rifle Club, and the Methodist church. In 1939, at the age of 90, Ramsay travelled to Winnipeg to visit the site of the Fort Garry gate, where he had travelled almost 70 years prior. At the time it was noted that he was one of the last remaining survivors of the Wolseley Expedition. He died at his daughter's home in Vancouver, British Columbia on December 5, 1942, at the age of 92. He was survived by his daughter and two sons. His wife predeceased him on May 16, 1925, in Vancouver.\n\nIt was said about him that he was \"one of those wholesome toilers in behalf of the people who never grow old in years and energy.\" A 1912 biography in the publication \"History of the province of Alberta\" noted that Ramsay was a man of \"broad mental grasp, cosmopolitan ideas and notable business sagacity\", with a \"thorough understanding of life, its principles and possibilities\" that was \"honoured and respected by all\". His former residence was in the present-day Calgary neighbourhood of Ramsay, situated east of the Elbow River and south of the CPR tracks, which is named in his honour.\n\n"}

He has also published the book \"Aquarium Plant Paradise\" (TFH Publications, 1997).\n\nA species of freshwater shrimp is named the “Amano shrimp” or \"Yamato shrimp\" (\"Caridina multidentata\"; previously \"Caridina japonica\") after him. After discovering this species' ability to eat large quantities of algae, Amano asked a local distributor to special order several thousand of them. They have since become a staple in the freshwater planted aquarium hobby.\n\nHe also developed a line of aquarium components that are known as Aqua Design Amano (ADA), and his \"Nature Aquarium\" article series appeared monthly in both \"Practical Fishkeeping\" magazine in the UK, and \"Tropical Fish Hobbyist\" magazine in the US. He died of pneumonia in 2015 at the age of 61.\n\nTakashi Amano wrote about freshwater aquascaping. He established a distinctive style of plant layout. He employed Japanese gardening concepts such as wabi-sabi and Zen rock arrangement. His tank compositions sought to mimic nature in their appearance. Amano also made extensive use of \"Glossostigma elatinoides\" and \"Riccia fluitans\" as plant material.\n\nHe founded Aqua Design Amano Co., Ltd. in 1982, providing aquatic plant growing equipment. His photo books of what he called the \"Nature Aquarium\", \"Glass no Naka no Daishizen\", published in 1992, followed by \"Mizu-Shizen eno kaiki\", were translated into seven languages.\n\nThe Amano shrimp (\"Caridina multidentata\") was introduced to the aquatic hobby by Takashi Amano as a means of controlling the growth of algae in the 1980s. The shrimp was therefore named after him.\n\nThis exhibit is one of Amano's major works. It features a tropical freshwater aquascape at the Lisbon Oceanarium. The aquarium is in length holding of water with more than 10,000 fish of 40 different species. The exhibit was opened on April 21, 2015.\n\nStarting in 1975, Amano visited tropical rainforests in Amazon, Borneo and West Africa and pristine forests in Japan, creating a series of photos focusing on \"untouched nature\" with large-format cameras. He captured minute details of nature on extra large size films (up to 8 × 20 inches). His works have been introduced internationally through several exhibitions and publications.\n\nAmano gave lectures on his photographic expeditions and his experiences in nature around the world, and he advocated for the environmental importance of tree-planting programs. He was a member of the Japan Professional Photographers Society, the Japan Advertising Photographers' Association, the International Environment Photographers Association, and the Society of Scientific Photography.\n\nTwo landscape photos of Takashi Amano were displayed at the 34th G8 summit Working Lunch / Outreach Working Session of Hokkaido Tokyo Summit held July 7–9, 2008. The photos of a cedar forest on Sado Island taken with an 8 × 20 inch large format camera were exhibited on the 4 × 1.5 m panels.\n\n"}

It is a corridor of sandy terrain forming a bow-like shape that connects an-Nafud desert in the north to Rub' al-Khali desert in the south. Its length is more than siding Twaik Mountains from the east and does not exceed in width. It is also considered the geographical margin separating Al-Ahsa Province from Najd. Al-Dahna Desert is therefore the string that connects the great deserts of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe desert is a series of seven successive deserts, separated from one another by plains. Roads pass through Al-Dahnā, linking Kuwait with Al-Zilfī and Riyadh and connecting Riyadh with Hasa.\n\nAl-Dahna desert is formed of high sand dunes spreading horizontally which are called veins (), mostly red in color since it contains Iron Oxides.\n\nBeneath the harsh deserts of Saudi Arabia lie dark chambers and complex mazes filled with crystalline structures, stalactites and stalagmites. The limestone floor of the Summan plateau, a karst area to the east of the ad-Dahna desert, is riddled with such caves, known locally as \"Dahls\". Some have tiny entrances which open into caves, others lead into a maze of passages which can be several kilometers long. Local Bedouin have always known these caves and some were used as water supplies. They were first systematically studied in the 1981, and later explored and reported by the Saudi Geological Survey.\n"}
{"id": "2111762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111762", "title": "Codebase", "text": "Codebase\n\nIn software development, a codebase (or code base) is a collection of source code used to build a particular software system, application, or software component. Typically, a codebase includes only human-written source code files; thus, a codebase usually does not include source code files generated by tools (generated files) or binary library files (object files), as they can be built from the human-written source code. However, it generally does include configuration and property files, as they are the data necessary for the build.\n\nA codebase is typically stored in a source control repository in a version control system. For smaller projects it may be kept as a simple set of files (even the Linux kernel was maintained as a set of files for many years). A source code repository is a place where large amounts of source code are kept, either publicly or privately. Source code repositories are used most basically for backups and versioning, and on multi-developer projects to handle various source code versions and to provide aid in resolving conflicts that arise from developers submitting overlapping modifications. Subversion, Git and Mercurial are examples of popular tools used to handle this workflow, which are common in open source projects.\n\nMultiple projects can have separate, \"distinct codebases,\" or can have a single, \"shared\" or \".\" This is particularly the case for related projects, such as those developed within the same company. In more detail, a monolithic codebase typically entails a single repository (all the code in one place), and often a common build system or common libraries. Whether the codebase is shared or split does not depend on the system architecture and actual build results; thus, a monolithic codebase, which is related to the actual development, does not entail a monolithic system, which is related to software architecture or a single monolithic binary. As a result, a monolithic codebase may and (for large codebases) often will consist of separate components, instead of carrying only a single system or single binary; a distributed codebase (with multiple components) can be used to build a single monolithic system or even a single binary. For example, the Linux kernel is architecturally a single monolithic kernel, but it consists of separate binaries (loadable components), and is developed in multiple distributed repositories.\n\nThere are both advantages and disadvantages to a monolithic codebase, when it is compared to a distributed codebase. Most simply, a monolithic codebase simplifies integrationchanges to different components or refactoring of code between components can be done easily and atomicallyand allows operations across the entire codebase, but requires a larger repository and makes it easier to introduce wide-ranging technical debt. A separate codebase or a distributed codebase keeps individual repositories smaller and more manageable, enforcing at the same time separation between components, but it also requires integration between codebases (or with the main repository), and complicates changes that span multiple codebases.\n\nIn terms of standards, referring to multiple codebases as \"distinct\" declares that there are independent implementations without shared source code and that, historically, these implementations did not evolve from a common project. This may be a way of demonstrating interoperability by showing two independent pieces of software that implement a given standard.\n\nSome notably large codebases include:\n"}

It is considered a national dish of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia, and is also common in Montenegro, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Slovenia, and Albania.\n\nĆevapi has its origins in the Balkans during the Ottoman period, and represents a regional speciality similar to the köfte kebab.\n\nThey are usually served in groups of five to ten pieces on a plate or in a flatbread (\"lepinje\" or \"somun\"), often with chopped onions, sour cream, kajmak, ajvar, feta cheese, minced red pepper and salt. Bosnian ćevapi are made from two types of minced beef meat, hand-mixed and formed with a funnel, while formed ćevapi are grilled. Serbian ćevapčići are made of either beef, lamb or pork or mixed.\n\nThe word \"ćevap\" is derived from the Turkish \"kebab\". The word is sometimes used in conjunction with the common South Slavic diminutive ending \"-čići\" (Serbo-Croatian: \"ćevapi/ćevapčići\" / ћевапи/ћевапчићи; ; Albanian: \"Qebapa/Qofte\"; ; ; ; Slovene: \"čevapčiči\"). The word \"ćevapi\" is plural; the singular form \"ćevap\" is rarely used, as a typical serving consists of several ćevapi.\n\nDuring the Ottoman administration, \"hajduks\" (rebels, outlaws) made the \"hajdučki ćevap\" (\"hajduk ćevap\"), which was easy to make, out of pieces of meat and smoked lard on a skewer roasted over fire. The recipe of the \"Leskovački ćevap\" (\"Leskovac ćevap\"), a local specialty of Serbia, was based on traditional pljeskavica (meat patty), formed as ćevap.\n\nLeskovac has a long history of grill shops. In Belgrade, ćevapčići first came from Leskovac in the 1860s, into the kafana \"Rajić\" at the Great Marketplace (today Studentski Trg), from where they quickly spread across the city, and subsequently, country. The industry quickly multiplied, as ćevapčići was the drinking public's favourite.\n\nThe ćevapčići were served at shops, known as \"ćevabdžija\" ( \"ćevabdžije\"). A 1927–28 study in Belgrade told that people either ate in the restaurant or outside (\"\"on the kaldrma\"\"), often take-away. The shops served from early morning to 10 AM, while often the dish was bought for breakfast.\n\nBefore the 1930s, they spread to the rest of Yugoslavia, including east of Serbia and the Macedonia region. By 1932, ćevapčići were regarded a local specialty in southern Serbia, Skopje and Peć. In 1933, the first street food vendor appeared in Maribor, Slovenia, who came from Leskovac, and served grilled meat, including ćevapčići. In 1940, ten pieces cost one Yugoslav dinar. In the second half of the 20th century, ćevapčići and other Oriental dishes entered Croatian cuisine. The Leskovac-styled grilled meat, including ćevapčići, have today become part of everyday-diet in Slovenia. Today, ćevapčići are found outside former Yugoslavia in the diaspora communities.\n\nToday, the grill shops are known as \"ćevabdžinica\" (pl. \"ćevabdžinice\").\n\nLeskovac organizes an annual grill festival, the Leskovac Grill Festival, as a showcase of ćevapi and other grilled meat.\n\nThey are usually served of 5–10 pieces on a plate or in a flatbread (\"lepinje\" or \"somun\"), often with chopped onions, sour cream, kajmak, ajvar, cottage cheese, minced red pepper and salt. Bosnian-type ćevapi are made from two types of minced beef meat, hand mixed and formed with a funnel, while formed ćevapi are grilled. Serbian-type ćevapi (ćevapčići) are made of either beef, lamb or pork, or mixed.\n\nIn Austria, Czech Republic and Slovakia, čevapčiči is generally served with mustard mixed with finely chopped raw onions and potatoes or French fries, in a common fast food manner.\n\n\nThere are variations in meat content and seasoning. The dish is kept simple, and traditionally served with Flatbread with onions and/or kajmak and yogurt as appetizer.\n\n\n"}

She settled in New York City and tutored the daughters of wealthy families.\n\nIn the summer of 1845, Ayres heard a speech by Episcopal clergyman William Augustus Muhlenberg and decided to follow a religious life. Rev. Muhlenberg, who deliberately never married, founded the Church of the Holy Communion in New York City in 1846. This parish church embodied his rich version of the liturgy (with flowers, music and color), as well as recognition of the need for social services within the parish (hence free pews, an unemployment fund, a school, and country trips for poor urban children).\n\nAyres gathered other women to teach at the school and do other charity work. They formed the Sisterhood of the Holy Communion (with Ayres as First Sister, having taken religious vows in a private ceremony before Muhlenberg on All Saints Day, 1845). Aware of longstanding prejudice against religious orders since the Protestant Reformation 300 years earlier, the new order did not wear habits, but had a secular dress code, as well as took renewable vows for three years at a time. The House of Bishops formally recognized the new order (the first religious order for women in the Episcopal Church) in 1852.\n\nThe order opened an infirmary in 1853, then provided nursing and other services at St. Luke's Hospital. From 1858 to 1877, Ayres both directed nursing and administered the hospital. However, in 1863, five women, led by Harriett Starr Cannon left the Sisterhood, and formed what ultimately became the Community of St. Mary, and which ultimately survived the sisterhood.\n\nIn 1870, Ayres also helped Muhlenberg found St. Johnland, a deliberately Christian community built on 500 acres of woodland and fields near Kings Park, Suffolk County on the northern part of Long Island This was designed to provide a haven for needy families from the city, as well as a refuge for the aged, handicapped children and urban youth.\n\nIn 1864, Ayers published her first book, anonymously, \"Practical Thoughts on Sisterhoods\". Three years later, she published \"Evangelical Sisterhoods: Two Letters to a Friend\" and in 1875 \"Evangelical Catholic Papers\". In 1880, three years after his death, Ayres first published \"The Life and Work of William Augustus Muhlenberg\".\n\nAyres died in 1896 at the hospital she founded. She is buried at the St. Johnland cemetery, as is Muhlenberg.\n\nThe liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church honors Ayres, together with Muhlenberg, with an annual feast day on April 8.\n\nThe sisterhood she founded remained active until 1940, and the hospital is now merged into the Roosevelt Hospital Centers. The St. Johnland community they founded continues to this day, under the guidance of a board of directors, although since the 1950s it has concentrated on providing care for the elderly, and it has recently partnered with a real estate developer.\n\n"}

The lineup originally seen in the film consists of the blue-skinned Ortolan keyboardist Max Rebo, a plump Kitonak woodwind player named Droopy McCool, and the spindly legged Pa'lowick lead singer Sy Snootles, while additional members were inserted into the later-edited Special Edition of the film. A great deal of further information about the band and the personal histories of its members is found in various literature of the now-noncanonical \"Star Wars\" Expanded Universe.\n\nThe group are classified as Jizz-wailers, which, according to the \"Star Wars Encyclopedia\", refers to a \"musician who plays a fast, contemporary, and upbeat style of music.\"\nMax and Droopy were portrayed by actors in bodysuits, while Sy was operated by two puppeteers who were stationed above and beneath the set. The new members seen in the 1997 Special Edition re-release of \"Return of the Jedi\" were computer-generated, as was Sy Snootles in said version.\n\nThe Torsten Band made their debut in \"Return of the Jedi\" during the scenes set in Jabba's palace on Tatooine. In the original version, the trio performs a Huttese-language pop song titled \"Lapti Nek\" (Huttese for \"Work It Out\"); the lyrics are about dancing. The track was replaced in the Special Edition with \"Jedi Rocks\", written by jazz musician Jerry Hey and described in the \"Star Wars\" Databank as a \"less-dated piece of music\".\n\nIn both versions of the film, the song is performed shortly after C-3PO and R2-D2 are given to Jabba. The group thereafter plays festive instrumental tunes, during which Max was the only band member who appears onscreen. The fate of the trio is unclear following the explosion of Jabba's sail barge after the unsuccessful execution attempt of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca.\n\nOther versions of the song \"Lapti Nek\" exist, including a 12-inch club mix, a dub mix, and a cover by Meco—as well as a later recording by vocalist/lyric writer Joseph Williams as Urth, which incorporates lyrics he wrote for \"Return of the Jedi\"s \"Ewok Celebration\".\n\nThe original members of the Max Rebo Band make several appearances in \"Star Wars\" Expanded Universe literature. Max, Droopy, and Sy are featured in John Gregory Betancourt's short story \"And the Band Played On: The Band's Tale,\" from the 1995 anthology \"Tales from Jabba's Palace\". According to the story, the band begins as a quartet called \"Evar Orbus and His Galactic Jizz-wailers.\" They arrive on Tatooine in three years after the Battle of Yavin depicted in \"A New Hope\", one year before the events of \"Return of the Jedi\", for a gig at the Mos Eisley cantina, but regular in-house band, the Modal Nodes, objects to the presence of a second group, and Orbus is killed by Nodes leader Figrin D'an following a scuffle aboard an airbus.\n\nDroopy and Sy elect Max as their new bandleader, and the trio secures an audition with Jabba the Hutt, who is pleased with their performance of \"Lapti Nek\". He offers the band a lifetime contract paid in food instead of money, much to Max's delight and Sy's disdain. However, the execution of Han, Luke, and Chewbacca at the Great Pit of Carkoon descends into chaos as Jabba is fatally strangled by Princess Leia, and the band escapes from Jabba's barge sans instruments just before it explodes. Droopy quits the group on the spot after wandering off into the desert to join fellow Kitonaks he hears playing in the distance, and Sy and Max join forces as the Max Rebo Duo. The book's epilogue describes the pair splitting up; Sy flops as a solo act while Max joins up with the Rebellion and uses his musical talents to entertain the troops.\n\nIn the 2000 Dark Horse release \"A Hot Time in the Cold Town Tonite!,\" Jabba sends the puzzled trio to the frozen planet Hoth to play for a rival crime lord, Bingo Mehndra, who threatens to feed the band to his pet Wampa if he suspected any kind of trickery. The group soon discovers that Jabba is actually using them as pawns in an assassination attempt against Bingo after they discover explosives hidden inside their speakers. They make their getaway by superimposing holograms of themselves from a past performance onto the stage, which Bingo realizes just as the explosives detonate. Though Jabba had blatantly endangered their lives, the band nonetheless chooses to avoid his wrath by returning to Tatooine.\n\nIn Dave Cooper's \"Stop That Jawa!\" (part of \"Star Wars Tales 2\" published by Dark Horse Comics in 2000), the trio has their instruments \"salvaged\" by Jawa scavengers outside the Mos Eisley cantina. They are then pursued by a droid bounty hunter who earlier overheard Sy badmouthing Jabba in the cantina. The bounty hunter is revealed at the conclusion to be a Derfian musician named Tik Tali Talosh, who pressures the Jawas into returning the instruments before proclaiming his adoration of the group and requesting an audition.\n\nThe original band has made minor appearances in other \"Star Wars\" media. The unfinished 1982 David Tomblin mockumentary \"Return of the Ewok\" showed them in Jabba's palace, and they briefly appeared in an October 1985 episode of the animated series \"\" titled \"The Lost Prince\", in which they performed in Doodnik's Café on the mining planet of Tyne's Horky. The trio also featured in the video games \"\" (2000) and \"\" (2005).\n\nIn May 2003, nearly six years after the rerelease of \"Return of the Jedi\", \"Star Wars Insider\" published brief biographies of the band's new members for an article called \"Jabbapalooza: Who's Who in the Max Rebo Band.\"\n\n\"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas stated that the scene featuring the band was intended to be an elaborate production, but the crew \"never really had the time\" to film it. Lucas commented, \"I thought [it] would be funny [to have a musical number] in the middle of a Star Wars film.\"\n\nThe original band members—Max, Sy, and Droopy—were puppets designed by Phil Tippett of Industrial Light and Magic's Creature Shop. Timothy D. Rose was the puppeteer for Sy. Lucas was not entirely pleased with the scene, saying that the puppets were too static and motionless. Special Edition producer Rick McCallum concurred that the requirements of the scene were too complex, even for animatronics.\n\nFor the 1997 rerelease of \"Return of the Jedi\", Sy Snootles was recreated entirely in CGI and nine new musicians and dancers were added, while Max and Droopy's screen time during the segment was reduced in comparison to the original film. Visual effects supervisor Dave Carson described the process of creating Sy and new character Joh Yowza as similar to sculpting clay models, adding that CGI characters were more like puppets than cartoons and that animators \"constantly find limitations: [the] characters don't bend right, or their mass isn't right,\" problems he claimed that confronted puppeteers.\n\nIn addition to the new characters, \"Lapti Nek\" was replaced with \"Jedi Rocks.\" Lucas insisted that the revised sequence added more atmosphere and quality to the film.\n\nMax Rebo is the stage name of Siiruulian Phantele, a stocky Ortolan keyboardist and eponymous leader of the Max Rebo Band. He plays a Red Ball Jett keyboard, which is similar to a circular reed organ with clavinet characteristics. Max was a founding member of Evar Orbus and His Galactic Jizz-wailers, but after Orbus's death, he is elected the group's new leader.\n\nLike other Ortolans, Max is a glutton; he ecstatically accepts a lifetime contract from Jabba that is paid in endless meals instead of money, which angers the rest of the group. With their contract terminated following Jabba's demise, Max and Sy team up as the Max Rebo Duo in the wake of Droopy's departure. After performing for Lady Valarian, the pair splits. Max joins the Rebel Alliance to entertain the troops, one reason being that \"the Rebellion has the best food.\" After the Galactic Civil War, he quits the music business and opens a chain of successful restaurants throughout the galaxy. He retires to a life of wealth and luxury on Coruscant.\n\nIn a nod to his physical appearance, Max's real name, Siiruulian Phantele, is a play on the words \"cerulean elephant.\" He was portrayed by Simon Williamson in both versions of \"Return of the Jedi,\" and the character was a puppet constructed from the waist up by ILM.\n\nSy Snootles is a robust female Pa'lowick who is the lead vocalist and original member of the band. She had an affair with her Yuzzum groupie, Clayton. She is angered at Max's acceptance of Jabba's contract, and after attempts to rework the deal prove futile, Sy resorts to secretly spying for over a dozen of Jabba's enemies to earn credits, but then works as a double agent by giving them false information provided by Bib Fortuna. She was also not above getting her hands dirty when she killed Ziro the Hutt to obtain for Jabba a book containing dirt on the other Hutt leaders.\n\nShe teams up with Max as the Max Rebo Duo following Jabba's death and Droopy's departure from the band. Following a brief gig for Lady Valarian, Sy dissolves her relationship with Max and begins her solo career, but her subsequent recordings sell poorly and she is relegated to touring Outer Rim dives under different stage names.\n\nDuring production, Sy Snootles' nickname was \"Ms. Snooty.\" In the original version of the film, the character was a marionette-like puppet operated by puppeteers Mike Quinn and Tim Rose; Quinn was stationed on scaffolding and controlled her upper body, while Rose moved her legs from beneath the set. The character's oversized ruby lips were suggested by George Lucas, who referred to them as \"Mick Jagger lips.\"\n\nSy was voiced in the original version of \"Jedi\" by Lucasfilm sound engineer Annie Arbogast, who also wrote the Huttese-language lyrics to \"Lapti Nek.\" The track was recorded at Lucasfilm's Sprocket Systems (currently Skywalker Sound), and was even the recipient of a 1983 Apex Award. For close-up shots, Sy's mouth was articulated using a nearly-invisible wire connected to a microphone stand. The puppet was replaced with a computer-generated image for the Special Edition rerelease. The CGI was spliced in with shots of the original puppet and created a continuity error with the puppet Sy's headdress feather appearing and disappearing during the film's first act.\n\nIn the \"\" series, she is voiced by Nika Futterman.\n\nDroopy McCool is the stage name of a slow-minded Kitonak musician and original member of the Max Rebo Band. He plays a chidinkalu horn, an instrument that resembles a clarinet. Droopy's actual birth name is a series of unpronounceable flute-like whistles, but he was renamed Snit by Orbus, who purchased him as a slave and forced him to join his band due to Snit's musical talents. Following Orbus's death, he is freed and given his familiar stage name by bandmate Sy Snootles. After the band flees Jabba's barge following his death, Droopy quits the group and wanders off alone into the desert to search for other members of his race. He is never seen again, but rumors among Tatooine's moisture farmers claim that the sound of Kitonak pipes have been heard from the far reaches of the desert.\n\nDroopy was played by Deep Roy in a full bodysuit for both versions of \"Return of the Jedi.\"\n\nThe following characters were added to the 1997 Special Edition version of the film.\n\nAk-rev is a leathery-faced Weequay skiff guard and drummer from the planet Sriluur. He had played the sacred drums in a monastery devoted to the Weequay god of thunder before moving to Tatooine to serve as one of Jabba's skiff guards, simply in order to mingle with other members of his race. He becomes a part-time drummer for the Max Rebo Band, and after Jabba's death, Ak-rev and fellow percussionist Umpass-stay attempt to flee to Mos Eisley, but the pair is ambushed by Tusken Raiders and Ak-rev is beaten to death.\n\nAccording to the \"Star Wars Databank\", his musical style is derived from the Japanese art of Taiko. His Special Edition actor was David Gonzalez.\n\nDoda Bodonawieedo is a green-skinned Rodian musician who plays a slitherhorn, a fictional wind instrument similar to a heckelphone. Orphaned at a young age after his family was killed by bounty hunters, Doda held an affinity for classical Rodian music and crime. His connections with the Tatooine underworld led him to Jabba the Hutt and the Max Rebo Band. Doda remains at Jabba's Palace during the execution at the Sarlacc; when he hears of Jabba's death, he steals several valuable statues from the palace and disappears.\n\nNelson Hall played Doda in the Special Edition, but was not included in the credits.\n\nBarquin D'an is a Bith musician from the planet Clak'dor VII who plays a Kloo horn, a fictitious wind instrument that resembles a bassoon. He is the estranged older brother of Figrin D'an, and resents the success of his brother's band, the Modal Nodes. He travels to Tatooine to join the Nodes, who are nowhere to be found after his arrival. Barquin stays to perform with local musicians and eventually joins the Max Rebo Band; unaccustomed to the depravity he witnesses in Jabba's Palace, he flees after Oola's gruesome death. After Jabba's demise, he quits music altogether and starts an import/export business.\n\nBarquin was portrayed by Don Bies in an uncredited role.\n\nGreeata Jendowanian is a female Rodian singer and backup vocalist for the Max Rebo Band. She gets her start playing the Kloo horn on a luxury starship called the \"Kuari Princess,\" where she befriends Sy Snootles. They become a duo and eventually join up with Max Rebo. After Jabba the Hutt's death and the band's escape into the desert, Greeata and fellow singer Lyn Me come to the band's rescue by driving off a group of Tusken Raiders and stealing their Banthas, which they ride to Mos Eisley.\n\nGreeata was played by Smuin Ballet creative director Celia Fushille in a Rodian bodysuit and mask for the Special Edition.\n\nLyn Me is a blue-skinned female Twi'lek dancer and backup vocalist in the Max Rebo Band. She becomes infatuated with Boba Fett and follows him to Tatooine, where she joins the band at Jabba's palace. She meets her hero but is later enraged at his death during the skirmish at the Sarlacc pit. Lyn and Greeata head out into the desert on a stolen landspeeder and rescue Max, Droopy, and Sy from Tusken Raiders before making off with their Banthas. She initially vows to take revenge on Han, Luke and Leia for their part in Fett's death, but then drops her vendetta .\n\nLyn Me was portrayed by ballet dancer Dalyn Chew.\n\nRappertunie is the stage name of Rapotwanalantonee Tivtotolon, a frog-like, potbellied Shawda Ubb musician who plays a harmonica-like instrument called a growdi, which is described in the \"Star Wars Databank\" as a cross between a water organ and a flute. He comes from the swamp planet of Manpha, and joins the band on Tatooine, but he confines himself to Jabba's palace due to the unpleasant desert environment, even though his small size places him in constant danger of being eaten. Rappertunie leaves Tatooine to continue his career after Jabba's death, but his knowledge of computer technology leads him to employment as an engineer for a manufacturer of MSE-6 droids.\n\nRappertunie was an 0.3 meter (0.98 foot)-tall puppet digitally composited into new and existing footage of the film, and was nicknamed \"\"Jedi Rapper\"\" by the filmmakers during production.\n\nRystáll Sant is a colorful female \"near-human\" singer and dancer from Coruscant. Her mother was human, and her father a Theelin, but Rystáll is orphaned as a small child without ever knowing them and she is taken in by Ortolan musicians. She and her adoptive family are enslaved by a lieutenant in the Black Sun criminal organization, before Lando Calrissian wins them from the criminal in a sabacc game and frees them from slavery. After relocating to Tatooine, she joins the Max Rebo Band as a backup vocalist and dancer. Boba Fett is briefly seen flirting with her prior to the arrival of Boushh.\n\nRystáll was portrayed by Canadian dancer Mercedes Ngoh in full-body makeup, which took four hours to apply for her lone day of shooting.\n\nUmpass-stay is a Klatooinian drummer with a canine-like snout and hooded eyes. He works as a spy and a guard for Jabba while performing as a drummer with the Max Rebo Band, and stays behind at Jabba's palace during the failed execution of Luke, Han and Chewbacca. After he is free following Jabba's death, Umpass-stay elects to become a servant for another Hutt household.\n\nLike Ak-rev, Umpass-stay's drumming was inspired by Taiko. His Special Edition actor was uncredited.\n\nJoh Yowza is the stage name of J'ywz'gnk Kchhllbrxcstk Et'nrmdndlcvtbrx, a short, furry Endorian creature known as a Yuzzum, as well as a lead singer in the Max Rebo Band. After he unknowingly stows away on a star freighter while searching for food, the captain keeps him aboard for cooking, cleaning, and other menial tasks. In return, Yowza is well-fed and taught Galactic Basic.\n\nWhile watching Evar Orbus and His Galactic Jizz-wailers perform at a cafe, he sings along. Impressed with his voice, Orbus signs Yowza, who performs for food and shelter, while Sy gives him his new stage name. After Orbus's death, Yowza joins the band on Tatooine after a successful audition for Jabba. The group disbands after Jabba's death and Yowza travels to Mos Eisley, where he finds a job on a small passenger liner and performs with its house band in exchange for free food and transportation throughout the Outer Rim.\n\nJoh Yowza appeared as a computer-generated image, but his voice actor was uncredited. The Yuzzums were originally slated to appear as a second race on Endor in the original version of the film, but were axed due to high production costs. Only one Yuzzum puppet was constructed, and included in the background of Jabba's palace.\n\nEvar Orbus is an eight-tentacled, beak-mouthed Letaki singer and musician who made his first canon appearance in \"And the Band Played On.\" He was the eponymous founder of Evar Orbus and His Galactic Jizz-wailers, in addition to purchasing Kitonak musician Snit (later Droopy McCool) as a slave and adding him to the lineup. The quartet agrees to play a gig at the Mos Eisley cantina, which leads to a conflict with incumbent group The Modal Nodes. After Orbus is killed by Figrin D'an, the band is then renamed after new leader Max Rebo.\n\nBrennan Tik Tali Talosh is a Derfian from the planet Derf and president of the Max Rebo Band Fan Club. The character first appeared at the end of \"Stop that Jawa!\" from \"Star Wars Tales 2\". He realizes his dream of playing with the group when he is invited to perform with them at Jabba's palace shortly before the Battle of Endor. After they split up, Talosh writes a tell-all book entitled \"Blue Man's Group\" (a pun on the performance trio Blue Man Group) without the band's permission, causing them to sever ties with him. He nonetheless treasures his brief stint with the band.\n\nFootnotes\nCitations\n"}

The rules concerning the kick-off are part of Law 8 of the Laws of the Game.\n\nA kick-off is used to start each half of play, and each period of extra time where applicable. The team that wins the pre-game coin toss may choose either\n\nThe kick-off to start the second half is taken by team which did not take the initial kick-off. If extra time is played, another coin-toss is used at the beginning of this period.\n\nA kick-off is also used to restart play after a goal is scored, and is taken by the team that conceded the goal.\n\nThe ball must be stationary and on the centre spot. All players, except for the kicker, must be in their own half of the field of play, and all opposing players must remain at least 10 yards (9.16m) from the ball (a distance marked on the pitch by the centre circle), until the ball is in play.\n\nOnce the referee has given the signal for the kick-off, the ball is kicked in any direction. The ball is in play once it is kicked and clearly moves. The player taking the kick-off may not touch the ball again until it has been touched by another player.\n\nA goal may be scored directly from a kick-off against the opposing team. An own goal may not be scored directly from the kick-off; if the ball goes directly into the goal of the team taking the kick-off, a corner kick is awarded to the opposing team.\n\nIf the kick-off is taken with a moving ball, or from the wrong place, the kick-off is retaken. A retake is also required if a player other than the kicker is in the opponents' half, or an opponent is less than 10 yards from the centre spot. A player who excessively delays the restart of play is cautioned.\n\nIt is an offence for the kicker to touch the ball a second time before it has been touched by another player; this is punishable by an indirect free kick to the opposing team from where the offence occurred, unless the second touch was also a more serious handling offence, in which case it is punishable by a direct free kick.\n\nOne of the few things known about the rules of English traditional football is the means by which the matches were started: it appears to have been the custom in several places for the game to start with the ball being \"thrown up\" in the middle of the field of play by a neutral official. The players would then contest for possession of the ball as it descended. The rules of Surrey Football Club, published in 1849, likewise specify that the game is started by the ball being \"tossed up in the centre of the ground\".\n\nA game played on Christmas Day 1841 is recorded as having been started with the ball placed in the middle of the field of play, with each team attempting to play the ball as soon as possible after the firing of a pistol.\n\nThe oldest published laws of football (Rugby School, 1845) specify that the game is to be started with a \"kick off\" from the middle of the field of play, which must be a place-kick. Most codes of laws from this era provide for a similar \"kick off\" from the centre of the ground; these include the Cambridge rules of 1856, the Sheffield rules of 1858, and the rules for Harrow football of 1858. One exception is the laws for the Eton field game (1862), which specify instead a \"bully\" in the middle of the field (similar to a scrummage in rugby union).\nThe novel \"Tom Brown's School Days\" (published in 1857 but based on the author's experiences at Rugby School from 1834 to 1842) gives a detailed description of the kick-off: \n\nThe passage above suggests that the winner of the toss, in the Rugby game, was awarded both kick-off and choice of goals. This was also the case in the Cambridge Rules of 1863, while in the Melbourne FC Rules of 1859 and 1860 the winner of the toss chose goals, while the loser kicked off.\n\nThe original FA laws of 1863 specify that \"[t]he winner of the toss shall have the choice of goals. The game shall be commenced by a place kick from the centre of the ground by the side losing the toss, the other side shall not approach within 10 yards of the ball until it is kicked off\". A \"place kick\" is further defined as \"a kick at the ball while on the ground, in any position in which the kicker may choose to place it\". The kick-off, which required the ball to be on the ground, was thus distinguished from the free kick, which could be taken \"in such manner as the kicker may think fit\", language which was interpreted as permitting a kick from hand (a drop-kick or a punt). \n\nAnother law states that \"[a]fter a goal is won the losing side shall kick off and the goals shall be changed.\"\n\nThe original laws of 1863 specified that the initial kick-off should be taken by the side losing the toss. In 1873, the team winning the toss was given the option of whether to choose ends or to take the initial kick-off. In 1997, the law was changed back, so that the initial kick-off was once again taken by the team losing the toss. The law was changed once again so beginning on June 1, 2019, the side winning the toss once again has the choice between kicking-off and choosing ends. The justification for this rule-change was that \"[r]ecent law changes have made the kick-off more dynamic (e.g. a goal can be scored directly from the kick-off) so captains winning the toss often ask to take the kick-off.\"\n\nThe original laws of 1863 made no provision for half-time. In 1870, based on a proposal by Wanderers F.C., a change of ends was introduced at half-time, but only if no goals had been scored in the first half; the law did not specify the means by which play should be started in the second half. In 1874, a change in the laws proposed by Harrow Chequers specified that a kick-off should occur at the start of the second half, provided no goal had been scored up to that point; this kick-off was taken by same side as originally kicked off the game. In 1875 a further change proposed by Queen's Park F.C. was accepted; there is always a break and change of ends at half-time, and the kick-off for the second half is taken by the opposite team to that which kicked off the first half.\n\nThe original laws of 1863 placed no restriction (other than offside) on the players' position during the kick-off, except that opponents could not approach within 10 yards of the ball. In 1874, a new restriction was added that all players had to be in their own half of the field. In 2017, the law was altered to allow the kicker to be in the opponents' half.\n\nAs a result of the International Football Conference of December 1882, it was decided that the kick-off had to be kicked forwards. This change was implemented in the Laws of the Game in 1883. This restriction was removed in 2016.\n\nIn 1905, it was specified that the ball \"must make a complete circuit or travel the distance of its circumference\" before being in play. In 1997, this requirement was eliminated: the ball became in play as soon as it was kicked and moved. In 2016, it was specified that the ball must \"clearly\" move.\n\nIn 1875, it was forbidden for the player taking the kick-off to play the ball again until it had been kicked by another player. \n\nIn 1875, it was forbidden to score a goal directly from the kick-off. This restriction was reversed in 1997, when it was permitted once again to score a goal directly from the kick-off. In 2016, at the same time the backwards kick-off was legalized, the possibility of scoring an \"own\" goal directly from the kick-off (an extremely unlikely situation) was removed, with a corner kick being awarded to the opponents instead.\n\nIn 1891, internal pitch-markings were introduced. These included a \"suitable mark\" at the centre of the pitch and a \"circle of radius 10 yards\" to mark the area within which opponents were forbidden.\n\nIn 1882, an indirect free kick was awarded to the opposition when the player taking the kick-off touched the ball a second time before it had touched another player. In 1887, an indirect free kick was also awarded for any other infringement of the laws: in 1903 this was changed to a retake.\n\n"}

His parents separated and left Tenby six months after his birth, leaving him with his paternal grandparents, Emily and Ernest, who adopted him. His grandparents were staunch Wesleyan Methodists who taught him to question everything; he attended the local Wesleyan Methodist chapel three times every Sunday, and became a lively rugby union scrum-half.\n\nHe passed the 11-plus and attended Greenhill Grammar School in Tenby, where he met English literature teacher Evelyn Ward, who recognised his writing and acting talent. Before Kenneth left school, his headmaster J. T. Griffith suggested that he drop the \"s\" from his surname so it would sound less English.\n\nGriffith left school and moved to Cambridge in 1937, taking a job at an ironmonger's weighing nails. This lasted only a day, and proved to be the only job he ever had outside the acting world. He approached the Cambridge Festival Theatre for work, and at the age of 16 was cast by Peter Hoare as Cinna the Poet in a modern-dress version of \"Julius Caesar\". \n\nHe became a regular jobbing repertory actor, making his West End theatre debut in 1938 with a small part in Thomas Dekker's \"The Shoemaker's Holiday\".\n\nGriffith volunteered for service with the Royal Air Force in 1939 before the outbreak of the Second World War. Before training in Canada, he returned to see his grandparents in Tenby, who, at his request, gave him a leather-bound copy of Hitler's book, \"Mein Kampf\"; he later explained in an interview that he wanted to understand what he was fighting against.\n\nWhilst training in Canada, he caught scarlet fever and was invalided out of the service in 1942, which resulted in his taking up stamp collecting. The first stamp he collected was the Siege of Ladysmith, South Africa.\n\nIn 1941, he made his debut in the first of more than 100 films in which he principally played character roles. Released from the air arm of the Royal Air Force, Griffith returned to London, from where he was invalided out of the RAF in 1942. He joined the Liverpool, Lancashire-relocated Old Vic, and in repertory. \n\nHe appeared in many British films between the 1940s and 1980s, notably as Archie Fellows in \"The Shop at Sly Corner\", Jenkins in \"Only Two Can Play\" (1962), the wireless operator Jack Phillips on board the \"Titanic\" in \"A Night to Remember\" (1958), in the crime caper \"Track the Man Down\" (1955) and especially in the comedies of the Boulting brothers, including \"Private's Progress\" (1956) and \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959). He portrayed the gay medic Witty in \"The Wild Geese\" (1978) and a whimsical mechanic in \"The Sea Wolves\" (1980).\n\nHe appeared in the episodes \"The Girl Who Was Death\" and \"Fall Out\" of the 1967–68 TV series \"The Prisoner\". Subsequent TV appearances included episodes of \"Minder\" and \"Lovejoy\", and critically acclaimed performances in \"War and Peace\" (1963), \"The Perils of Pendragon\", \"Clochemerle\" and \"The Bus to Bosworth\", where his personification of a Welsh schoolteacher out on a field trip won him many accolades back in his homeland of Wales. \n\nHis later film roles included the \"mad old man\" in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" (1994), Reverend Jones in \"The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain\" (1995) and the Minister in \"Very Annie Mary\" (2001).\n\nIn 1965, Huw Wheldon and the director of BBC2, David Attenborough, asked Griffith if he would like to make a film for the BBC on any subject that he chose. This resulted in a series of films on subjects as diverse as the Boer War in \"Soldiers of the Widow\" (BBC tx. 27/5/1967), \"A Touch of Churchill\", \"A Touch of Hitler\" (BBC tx. 30/7/1971), the controversial story of Thomas Paine in \"The Most Valuable Englishman Ever\" (BBC, tx. 16/1/1982), David Ben-Gurion (\"The Light\"), Napoleon Bonaparte (\"The Man on the Rock\"), Jawaharlal Nehru, Roger Casement (\"Heart of Darkness\" 1992) and on one occasion a film commissioned by Thames Television on the story of the Three Wise Men of the New Testament, \"A Famous Journey\" (ITV tx. 20/12/1979). Griffith was expelled from Iran by the country's Foreign Minister. \n\nIn 1973, Griffith made a documentary film about the life and death of Irish military and political leader Michael Collins titled \"Hang Up Your Brightest Colours\" (which is a line taken from a letter from George Bernard Shaw to one of Collins' sisters after Collins' assassination) for ATV, but the Independent Broadcasting Authority did not permit it to be screened (it was not shown by the BBC until 1993).\n\nIn 1974, for a programme titled \"Curious Journey\", he interviewed nine surviving IRA members from the 1916–23 period, i.e. the Easter Rebellion, Anglo-Irish War and Irish Civil War; they were Maire Comerford, Joseph Sweeney, Sean Kavanagh, John O'Sullivan, Brigid Thornton, Sean Harling, Martin Walton, David Nelligan (or Neligan) and Tom Barry. He was allowed to buy this last film back, as long as he did not mention who had commissioned it (the Welsh TV company HTV). At one point in his career, Griffith accused the anti-censorship group, Index, of censoring him by delaying the publication of two book reviews he had written for its magazine.\n\nHis sympathetic portrayal caused some concern, given The Troubles and ATV boss Sir Lew Grade decided to withdraw the film, which was not shown publicly until 1994. In response Griffith made a documentary, \"The Public's Right to Know\", for Thames TV. The political troubles left him \"a frustrated and bemused figure\". Screenonline described Griffith as \"a world class documentary film-maker\" who knew that \"refusing to compromise his views has damaged his career\".\n\nHis autobiography, \"The Fool's Pardon\", was published in 1994 by Little, Brown. BBC Wales presented a retrospective season of five of his documentaries in 1993, including the suppressed Michael Collins work, opening the season with a biographical study of Griffith called \"The Tenby Poisoner\" (BBC Wales, tx. 1/3/1993) in which Peter O'Toole, Martin McGuinness and Jeremy Isaacs paid tribute. BBC Wales screened a film on Griffith's life in the \"Welsh Greats\" Series Two, shown in 2008. In 1994, Griffith was given a Cymru lifetime achievement award by BAFTA.\n\nA Boer War historian, Griffith was sympathetic to the Afrikaners in South Africa. His opinion, in a South African television-funded documentary, released in 1984, was \"provokingly sympathetic\" towards the Afrikaners; South African television eventually withdrew its funding. He made a BBC2 documentary on runner Zola Budd, which purported to reveal injustices done to her by left-wing demonstrators and organisations during a tour of England in 1988.\n\nHe named his home (110 Englefield Road, Islington, London) as Michael Collins' House. In later life, Griffith said: \"In my time I've been accused of being a Marxist, a fascist, a traitor and, probably worst in most people's eyes, inconsistent. I was a radical Socialist. I'm now a radical Tory. It has been a very painful journey\".\n\nGriffith was married and divorced three times, and had five children:\n\nGriffith suffered from complications associated with Alzheimer's disease in his later years, resulting in his retirement. He died at his home in London on 25 June 2006, aged 84. He was buried on 4 July 2006. At his request, his coffin was decorated with the flags of Wales, the Untouchables of India (of whose society he was president for many years), Israel, and the Irish tricolour. Griffith was interred beside his beloved grandparents (Emily and Ernest) in the churchyard adjoining St Nicholas and St Teilo Church in his native Penally.\n\nTenby Museum and Art Gallery in Pembrokeshire houses an archive of \"national importance\" of Griffith's papers and documentaries, and a cabinet containing a collection of personal memorabilia from his house in Islington. The National Screen and Sound Archive of Wales have audio interviews with Griffith.\n"}

{"id": "2111826", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111826", "title": "Kickoff (gridiron football)", "text": "Kickoff (gridiron football)\n\nA kickoff is a method of starting a drive in gridiron football. Typically, a kickoff consists of one team – the \"kicking team\" – kicking the ball to the opposing team – the \"receiving team\". The receiving team is then entitled to \"return\" the ball, i.e., attempt to advance it towards the kicking team's end zone, until the player with the ball is tackled by the kicking team, goes out of bounds, or scores a touchdown. Kickoffs take place at the start of each half of play, the beginning of overtime in some overtime formats, and after scoring plays.\n\nCommon variants on the typical kickoff format include the onside kick, in which the kicking team attempts to regain possession of the ball; a touchback, which may occur if the ball is kicked into the receiving team's end zone; or a fair catch, in which a player on the receiving team asks to catch the ball without interference from the kicking team, waiving his entitlement to attempt a return rush. Additionally, penalties exist for various infractions such as a player violating his position restrictions prior to the kick (5-yard penalty), or if the ball goes out of bounds before touching a player (25 yards or placed at receiving team's 40-yard line, whichever is farther).\n\nA kickoff occurs at the start of each half and before each overtime (in the National and Arena Football Leagues). It is also traditionally decided by a coin toss at the beginning of each game carried out by the referee. The visiting team captain calls either heads or tails. The winner of the coin toss elects whether to take first choice in the first half or the second half. The captain with first choice then picks either a team to kick off or an end of the field to defend. The other captain chooses the remaining option. At the beginning of the second half, the two captains choose in the reverse order. If an overtime is required, another coin toss takes place to decide who gets first possession during the overtime. After a touchdown the scoring team kicks the ball off to the opposing team. In American football a field goal also results in a kickoff by the scoring team, but in Canadian football the scored-against team has an option of scrimmaging from their 35-yard line or receiving a kickoff.\n\nAfter a safety in Canadian football, the scored-against kicks off. In American football, a kickoff is an option, but most teams choose to punt the ball on the free kick; the National Football League, in contrast to most other leagues, prohibits the use of a kicking tee on a safety free kick.\n\nThe line where the ball is placed for kickoff varies among the rule books. It is placed on the kicking team's 30-yard line in six-man football, 35-yard line in college and professional outdoor football, 40-yard line in American high school football, 45-yard line in amateur Canadian football, and the goal line in indoor and arena football. For the 2016 season only, the Ivy League placed the ball on the 40-yard line in conference games. All players on the kicking team except the kicker (and, if used, a holder) must not cross the line at which the ball is placed until the ball is kicked. The receiving team must stay behind the line that is 10 yards from where the ball is placed. The ball can be fielded by the receiving team at any point after it has been kicked, or by the kicking team after it has traveled 10 yards or has been touched by a member of the receiving team. In American football (but not Canadian) touchback and fair catch rules apply to the kicked ball. If it is fielded by the kicking team, it is called an onside kick. A low, bouncing kick is called a squib kick. Although a squib kick typically gives the receiving team better field position than they would if a normal kick had been used, a squib kick is sometimes used to avoid giving up a long return, as well as use up a valuable amount of time on the clock, as it is impossible to fair catch such a kick. It is usually done when a team takes the lead in the final seconds, and is done to safely run out the remainder of the clock. Squib kicking with more than 20 seconds remaining has had unfortunate results (a line drive kick is more common when there are 20 to 50 seconds remaining; the typical hurry-up offense drive takes over a minute), but has been done by some teams.\n\nIf a receiving player crosses his restraining line before the kick, the ball is to be advanced 5 yards, then re-kicked. If a kicking team player crosses the line at which the ball is placed before it is kicked, the receiving team has the option either to have the kicking team re-kick from 5 yards farther back, or have 5 yards added on to the end of the return. In high school football, the receiving team only has the option to make the kicking team re-kick.\n\nIf the ball goes out of bounds without being touched by a player, the receiving team can choose either to have the ball moved back 5 yards and re-kicked, to take the ball 25 yards (25 yards under National Federation high school rules) past the spot of the kick (usually at their own 35-yard line), or to take the ball where it went out of bounds. On an onside kick, if the ball does not travel ten yards before the kicking team recovers the ball, they will take a 5-yard penalty and have the chance to kick another onside kick. If the onside kick goes less than 10 yards again, the receiving team will receive the ball at the spot the kicking team recovered it. However, if the receiving team touches the ball before it goes 10 yards, either team can recover it unpenalized.\n\nKickoffs entering the end zone are handled differently in American and Canadian rules. In the American college and professional game, if the ball goes out of bounds in the receiving team's end zone or is recovered and downed in the receiving team's end zone, the ball is placed at the receiving team's 25-yard line, and possession is given to the receiving team; these are known as touchbacks. High school football immediately rules the ball dead when the ball crosses the goal line; the ball cannot be returned from the end zone, nor can it be recovered there for a touchdown. NFL immediately rules the ball dead, when the ball touches the ground in the endzone, if not been touched by the receivers before. In the Canadian game if the ball goes into the end zone and then out of bounds without being touched, the receiving team scrimmages from the 25-yard line (no points are scored). If the receiving team gains possession of a kickoff in its own end zone and then fails to return it into the field of play, the kicking team scores one point, and the receiving team scrimmages from the 35-yard line. Various forms of indoor football also recognize the single, but the ball must not only cross the end zone, but pass through the uprights (as in a field goal) as well. If the kicking team recovers its own kickoff in the end zone in any version of the game (something that, as previously mentioned, is impossible in high school football), it scores a touchdown.\n\nKickoffs into the end zone resulting in touchbacks became much more common in the NFL in 2011 as a result of a rule change. Whereas the kicking team previously kicked the ball off from their 30-yard line, the NFL moved the spot of the kickoff up 5 yards before the 2011 season in an attempt to avoid injuries from high-speed collisions. Only 16 percent of kickoffs in the 2010 season were touchbacks, but that jumped to almost 44 percent after the rule change.\n\nTo receive a kickoff and set up a kickoff return, the receiving team sets up their players starting from 10 yards back from the point the ball is kicked from. There are usually one or two players positioned deep (around the goal line) that will attempt to catch or pick up the ball after it is kicked off by the opposing team's kicker. They will then attempt to carry the ball as far as possible upfield, without being tackled or running out of bounds. The other players are to block the kickoff team from getting to their kickoff returner.\n\nIn certain leagues consisting of younger players, and in the short-lived professional Alliance of American Football, there are no kickoffs. Teams are automatically awarded the ball at a certain spot on the field. In the AAF, this spot was the 25-yard line of the team receiving possession.\n\n\n"}

After the First World War, he served in Greece, Russia, the Balkans and Asia Minor. He was Governor of South Australia from 1922–27.\n\nBridges was born at Park Farm, Eltham, Kent, England, to Major Thomas Walker Bridges and Mary Ann Philippi. He was educated at Newton Abbot College and later at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He was married in London on 14 November 1907, to a widow, Janet Florence Marshall; they had one daughter, Alvilde Bridges, who was married first to Anthony Chaplin, 3rd Viscount Chaplin, and then to James Lees-Milne.\n\nAfter graduating from the Royal Military Academy, Bridges joined the Royal Artillery as a second lieutenant on 19 February 1892, and soon served in India and Nyasaland (now Malawi). He was promoted to lieutenant on 19 February 1895, and was seconded to the Central Africa Regiment from July to November 1899, when he transferred to South Africa to serve in the Second Boer War. Attached to the Imperial Light Horse, he took part in the relief of Ladysmith, and received the rank of captain supernumerary to the establishment on 5 April 1900. For a few months in 1901 he was in command of two West Australian Mounted infantry contingents, and was severely wounded. He was confirmed as captain in the Royal Artillery on 8 January 1902, and served in South Africa till the end of the war in June 1902, after which he left Cape Town in the SS \"Plassy\" in August, returning to Southampton the following month. For his war service, he was mentioned in despatches (including the final despatch by Lord Kitchener dated 23 June 1902,) and received a brevet promotion as major on 22 August 1902. Later that year saw him leave United Kingdom for Berbera, where he took charge of Guns in a Flying Column serving in Somaliland. In 1908, he became the chief instructor at the Cavalry School at Netheravon. Seeking a more rapid promotion in the army, Bridges transferred to the 4th Queen's Own Hussars in 1909, attaining the substantive rank of major. He was appointed military attaché to the Low Countries and Scandinavia between 1910 and 1914.\n\nEarly in World War I, Bridges was involved in the Battle of Mons, where he suffered a shattered cheekbone and concussion. During the British Army's retreat, he met two battalions of exhausted British soldiers at Saint Quentin, whose officers planned to surrender to save the town from bombardment. In a celebrated incident on 27 August, the injured Bridges used a tin whistle and toy drum purchased from a toy shop to rally the men and led them to rejoin General French's army. In October, French flew Bridges to the besieged Belgian city of Antwerp to provide intelligence there for the British headquarters.\n\nHe was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1915 and given command of the 19th (Western) Division of the New Army, which was demoralised after severe casualties at the Battle of Loos. In 1916 he was promoted to major general. He set about turning the 19th Division into an efficient fighting unit, purging the senior officers. The division was in reserve on the disastrous first day of the Battle of the Somme, and thus avoided serious casualties. It acquitted itself well in the small subsequent attacks around La Boiselle in July.\n\nIn 1917, Bridges was sent on the Balfour Mission, military liaison to the United States under Arthur Balfour, soon after the Americans entered the war, to coordinate the sending of American soldiers to Europe. He ran into some difficulty because, like most British generals and politicians, he pushed for the amalgamation or incorporation of Americans into understrength British units to be commanded by British officers. This caused much friction as the American general staff felt that US troops should be commanded by US officers.\n\nBridges returned in time to lead his division at Passchendaele in 1917. He was severely injured on 20 September at the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge, losing a leg. However he recovered quickly, and after a brief stint as head of the trench warfare department of Churchill's Ministry of Munitions, was sent back to Washington to coordinate the dispatch of American reinforcements to the Western Front. The rate of reinforcements was soon increased threefold.\n\nSubsequently, Bridges was appointed to liaison missions to Greece, the Balkans, and Russia (where he was responsible for the evacuation of the British Mission and the remains of the anti-Bolshevik White Army from Novorossiysk in March 1920). His final active service was in Greece, fighting against the Turks in Asia Minor.\n\nAfter the war, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (1919) and a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (1925). His uncle, the Poet Laureate Robert Bridges, also honoured him with an ode \"To His Excellency\".\n\nBridges was appointed Governor of South Australia in 1922, at the instigation of his friend Winston Churchill. Bridges arrived in Adelaide in December of the same year.\n\nBridges was a conservative governor, defending capital punishment, supporting the Legislative Council, and denouncing \"unemployables\". He was also popular with returned servicemen. His speeches were dominated mostly by denouncements of Bolshevism, and promotion of immigration. He was scornful of the Prohibition movement, and created a political storm by addressing a licensed victualler's dinner, entertaining them with G. K. Chesterton drinking songs and other hilarious prohibition stories.\n\nBridges became frustrated with the Labor ministries of 1924–27. He was particularly angered by Premier John Gunn's publishing of a secret memorandum of a former premier to the governor. When he was offered a second term as governor in 1927 he refused it, and returned to London that year.\n\nBridges devoted his retirement to painting and writing. He published several books:\n\n\nHe had also studied at the Slade School of Fine Art, and was an accomplished painter. He held many one-man exhibitions in Adelaide and London where his oils and watercolours were sold.\n\nHe died at 12 Dyke Road, Brighton, on 26 November 1939.\n"}

He was the fourth child in a family of five of an immigrant couple from Germany. His eldest brother, and their father's favored son, Herman, died before Harold's birth; he was given his middle name in this child's memory. Before finishing high school he had discontinued using his own first name in favor of his middle name to please his father, a lumber man who owned a number of logging camps. His first career was as an athlete. At the University of Washington, where he majored in economics, he played football (tackle) in the 1926 Rose Bowl and was a track-and-field star. Two years later, he won the Silver medal for the shot put in the 1928 Olympic Games. He also won four consecutive AAU shot put titles (1928–31), the NCAA title in 1927, and the AAU indoor titles in 1930 and 1932. In 1930 he set a world indoor record at .

Brix, however, broke his shoulder filming the 1931 football film \"Touchdown\", so swimming champion Johnny Weissmuller replaced Brix and became a major star.\nAfter Ashton Dearholt convinced Burroughs to allow him to form Burroughs-Tarzan Enterprises, Inc., and make a Tarzan serial film, Dearholt cast Brix in the lead. Pressbook copy has it that Burroughs made the choice himself, but, in fact, in his biography, Brix confirmed that Burroughs never even saw him until after the contract was signed, and then only briefly. The film was begun on location in Guatemala, under rugged conditions (jungle diseases and cash shortages were frequent). Brix did his own stunts, including a fall to rocky cliffs below. \"The Washington Post\" quoted Gabe Essoe's passage from his book \"Tarzan of the Movies\": \"Brix's portrayal was the only time between the silents and the 1960s that Tarzan was accurately depicted in films. He was mannered, cultured, soft-spoken, a well educated English lord who spoke several languages, and didn't grunt.\"\nDue to financial mismanagement, Dearholt had to complete filming of much of the serial back in Hollywood, and Brix, although his travel and daily living expenses in Guatemala were covered throughout the shoot, never received his contracted salary, along with the rest of the cast. The finished film, \"The New Adventures of Tarzan\", was released in 1935 by Burroughs-Tarzan, and offered to theatres as a 12-chapter serial or a seven-reel feature. A second feature, \"Tarzan and the Green Goddess,\" was culled from the footage in 1938. He also portrayed the titular hero in Republic's serial \"Hawk of the Wilderness\".\n\nBrix continued to work in serials and action features for low-budget studios until 1939. Finding himself still typecast as Tarzan in the minds of major producers, Brix changed his name to \"Bruce Bennett\" and became a member of Columbia Pictures' stock company. During the next few years he would be seen playing minor roles in many Columbia films, ranging from expensive dramas to B mysteries and Three Stooges shorts, such as \"How High Is Up?\" His screen career was interrupted by World War II, when he served in the United States Navy.\n\nBennett appeared in many films in the 1940s and early 1950s, including \"Sahara\" (1943) with Humphrey Bogart, \"Mildred Pierce\" (1945) with Joan Crawford, \"Nora Prentiss\" (1947) with Ann Sheridan, \"Dark Passage\" (1947) with Bogart and Lauren Bacall, \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" (1948) with Bogart and Walter Huston, \"Mystery Street\" (1950) with Ricardo Montalban, \"Sudden Fear\" (1952) with Joan Crawford and Gloria Grahame and \"Strategic Air Command\" (1955) with James Stewart.\n\nThe \"Washington Post\" noted, \"Bennett moved into grittier roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s, playing a detective in William Castle's \"Undertow\" and a forensic scientist who helps solve a crime in John Sturges' \"Mystery Street\". He also portrayed an ageing baseball player in \"Angels in the Outfield\" (1951).\n\nIn 1954, Bennett played William Quantrill, the Confederate guerrilla figure, in an episode of the syndicated television series \"Stories of the Century\", starring and narrated by Jim Davis. Bennett made five guest appearances on \"Perry Mason\", including his role as murder victim Lawrence Balfour in the 1958 episode \"The Case of the Lucky Loser\" and as murderer Dan Morgan in the 1961 episode \"The Case of the Misguided Missile.\" He was also in five episodes of \"Science Fiction Theatre\".\n\nBennett had two children, Christopher Brix and Christina Katich, by longtime wife Jeannette, who died in 2000. They named their children after his parents. They had three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.\n\nFrom the mid-1950s on, Bennett mainly appeared in B-films and on television in guest-starring roles. Two films from this period are \"The Alligator People\" (1959) and the \"Fiend of Dope Island\" (filmed 1959, released 1961). Bennett, in fact, co-wrote the latter production and portrays the title character.\n\nOutside his acting career, Bennett became a very successful businessman during the 1960s. He also continued to pursue his lifelong interest in parasailing and skydiving. He last skydived at the age of 96, descending from an altitude of 10,000 feet near Lake Tahoe.\n\nBennett turned 100 on May 19, 2006, and died less than a year later in February 2007 of complications from a broken hip.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

The protocol is included in the \"Heathrow Manual of Air Traffic Services\" and the airport's noise abatement notification, and thus is a part of the airport's operating rules.\n\nOn 15 January 2009, the Labour Government announced that it was ending the Cranford Agreement as part of the controversial expansion of London Heathrow Airport. Although in May 2010 the Coalition Government cancelled the Heathrow expansion plans, in September 2010 it reaffirmed the decision to end the Cranford Agreement. This decision was welcomed by the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, to the west. To the east, the London Borough of Hounslow called for mitigation or compensation to be offered by BAA to those affected by ending the Cranford Agreement.\n\nIn May 2013 Heathrow Airport Holdings (who own and operate the airport) submitted planning permission to the London Borough of Hillingdon to build new access taxiways, which would allow the implementation of full runway alternation on easterly operations. This permission was rejected in March 2014; Heathrow Airport appealed with a planning enquiry in June 2015. On 2 February 2017 the Planning Inspectorate recommended that the appeal be allowed and planning permission granted. The decision has not yet been implemented as the airport is considering the Government's airspace management proposals for London and their own plans for expansion.\n"}

{"id": "2111892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111892", "title": "Friday Rock Show", "text": "Friday Rock Show\n\nThe Friday Rock Show was a radio show in the United Kingdom that was broadcast on BBC Radio 1 from 10pm to midnight on Friday nights, from 17 November 1978 until 2 April 1993.\n\nThroughout most of its run, the show was hosted by Tommy Vance. Ostensibly for the genre of rock in general, it was most closely associated with heavy metal. In the early 1980s it was the only nationally available outlet for this genre of music, and Vance's enthusiasm for showcasing new bands and his rapport with fans made the show essential listening for rockers. \n\nThe show played a significant role in the rise of the new wave of British heavy metal, which came to dominate the show by the early 1980s. Initially the show had been intended as a continuation of Alan Freeman's 1973–78 Saturday afternoon show, and included elements of post-punk and new wave music. The show had the additional good fortune of being able to \"borrow\" the 88–91 MHz FM transmitters of BBC Radio 2, allowing listeners to enjoy the music in the best available quality for the time, before Radio 1 finally acquired its own FM frequency in 1988.\n\nBefore this happened, the show was temporarily given an extra hour from 21:00 to 22:00, probably because Alan Freeman's Capital London's Monday rock show had been moved to Friday nights starting at 21:00. This was heard on medium wave only, except in London and parts of the south east, where it was relayed by BBC Radio London's FM transmitter. After Radio 1's move to 24-hour FM broadcasting, the show's time slot was put back half an hour from 22:30 to 00:30, but only for a brief period and after returning to its original slot, the show eventually moved to run from 21:00 to 23:00.\n\nBy 1993, the introduction into Britain of a much wider choice of television and radio channels had made heavy metal more accessible and the show less important, and Tommy Vance left Radio 1 to join the original line-up of Virgin Radio.\n\nThe show generally included a studio session or live performance each week. Many of these studio sessions were engineered, mixed and produced by Dave Dade, BBC Senior Studio Manager, who worked closely with show producer Tony Wilson. Also featured were recordings from the BBC radio archives, both live and studio-sessions, from as far back as the late 1960s. This material included bands such as Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Jethro Tull, Uriah Heep, The Nice, Rush and Genesis, among others. At the time the majority of this material was not available on general release and even today, in the current era of the deluxe edition CD album featuring bonus tracks, some remains unavailable to the general public, mainly because Tony Wilson took the tapes with him when he left the BBC in 1995.\n\nOther features included \"The Friday Night Connection\", a quiz in which listeners had to identify three pieces of music and the connection or theme between them. From the beginning of 1985, this was replaced by \"Lie Back And Enjoy It\". Listeners would send in a list of tracks that would last for about 20 minutes, but did not have to have a connection. The person whose selection was chosen would still receive the record voucher and Van der Graaf's \"Theme One\" was still used to introduce the feature. In the late 80s, Vance introduced \"Rock War\" (later renamed \"Rock Challenge\" during the 1991 Gulf War), in which listeners were asked to vote for the best of three demo tapes sent in by aspiring bands. Another feature was the listeners' all-time chart, which took place once a year on the show's anniversary/birthday (Now We Are 1, Now We Are 2, etc.), during which were played the most popular rock tracks, as voted for by the listeners. (This invariably finished with Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to Heaven\" at #1.)\n\nFor most of its run, its intro and closing theme tune was the Dixie Dregs instrumental \"Take it Off the Top\", and the quiz used the Van der Graaf Generator track \"Theme One\" (a cover of the theme tune originally written for Radio 1 by George Martin in 1967); other jingles were written and performed by Samson (with Nicky Moore on vocals), Rose Tattoo and Vow Wow. The show replaced John Peel on Friday nights, but Peel's show had previously featured more mainstream styles of rock music than he personally favoured as \"part of a review function\"; after the Friday Rock Show began, Peel was able to concentrate on the post-punk styles he was most enthused by at this point.\n\nIncidental music was used whilst Vance was chatting between playing discs. Examples are \"Red lady Too\", George Harrison from his 1968 Apple LP \"Wonderwall Music\"; and \"The Stumble\", John Mayall with Peter Green. Decca 1967. Also \"Open Invitation\" by Santana from their 1978 LP \"Inner Secrets\", spliced together by producer Tony Wilson from two guitar passages when the pace of the song accelerated. \n\n\"Jas'Moon\" by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band is another backing track, as is Stanley Clarke's \"Silly Putty\" (from the album \"Journey To Love\"). \"Chasin' the Voodoo\" by Al Di Meola is another (Album: \"Casino\"). The only Mahavishnu Orchestra 45 RPM record \"Can't Stand Your Funk\" from the 1974 record \"Visions of the Emerald Beyond\" was another musical bed for Tommy to talk over.\n\nThe tracks used as incidental music changed during the years the show was broadcast and towards the late 80s no background music was used. A complete list of the tracks used as incidental music is as follows;\n\n\nThe first top 10 from 1979 called \"Now We Are One\" was as follows:\n\n\nThe second top 10, \"Two's Up - The Listeners' Top Ten\" was broadcast on 14 November 1980.\n\nThe third top 10, was broadcast on 13 November 1981.\n\nThe show was taken over by Claire Sturgess, who had been Radio 1 DJ Simon Bates' secretary prior to her appointment, but it went on a temporary break for a while. It was moved to Sunday afternoons when Matthew Bannister became controller in October 1993, and then to Sunday evenings in May 1994. For its last year, 1995–6, it was broadcast from Glasgow and presented by John Cavanagh. The format of the programme fundamentally changed when Sturgess took over, firmly setting out its stall in the 'contemporary thrash' genre.\n\nBruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden fronted a new Friday Rock Show on BBC Radio 6 Music between 9 pm and twelve midnight. The show ran for eight years until 28 May 2010.\n\nDuring 2016, Vintage TV began broadcasting a programme entitled 'The Friday Night Rock Show'. Hosted by Nicky Horne, who hosted similar shows on Capital Radio during the Friday Rock Show's peak period, the show's title was chosen with the intention of paying tribute to the legacies of Tommy Vance and Alan Freeman.\n\nNWOBHM band Saxon paid tribute to the Friday Rock Show in their song \"Denim and Leather\".\n\nA number of recordings, made when Tommy Vance fronted the Friday Rock Show, were issued on an independent record label Raw Fruit Records in the early 1990s.\n\n"}

{"id": "2111904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111904", "title": "Alpheidae", "text": "Alpheidae\n\nAlpheidae is a family of caridean snapping shrimp, characterized by having asymmetrical claws, the larger of which is typically capable of producing a loud snapping sound. Other common names for animals in the group are pistol shrimp or alpheid shrimp.\n\nThe family is diverse and worldwide in distribution, consisting of about 1,119 species within 38 or more genera. The two most prominent genera are \"Alpheus\" and \"Synalpheus\", with species numbering well over 250 and 100, respectively. Most snapping shrimp dig burrows and are common inhabitants of coral reefs, submerged seagrass flats, and oyster reefs. While most genera and species are found in tropical and temperate coastal and marine waters, \"Betaeus\" inhabits cold seas and \"Potamalpheops\" is found only in freshwater caves.\n\nWhen in colonies, the snapping shrimp can interfere with sonar and underwater communication. The shrimp are considered a major source of noise in the ocean.\n\nThe snapping shrimp grows to only long. It is distinctive for its disproportionate large claw, larger than half the shrimp's body. The claw can be on either arm of the body, and, unlike most shrimp claws, does not have typical pincers at the end. Rather, it has a pistol-like feature made of two parts. A joint allows the \"hammer\" part to move backward into a right-angled position. When released, it snaps into the other part of the claw, emitting an enormously powerful wave of bubbles capable of stunning larger fish and breaking small glass jars.\n\nSome pistol shrimp species share burrows with goby fishes in a mutualistic symbiotic relationship. The burrow is built and tended by the pistol shrimp, and the goby provides protection by watching out for danger. When both are out of the burrow, the shrimp maintains contact with the goby using its antennae. The goby, having the better vision, alerts the shrimp of danger using a characteristic tail movement, and then both retreat into the safety of the shared burrow. So far this association has been observed in species that inhabit coral reef habitats.\n\nEusocial behavior has been discovered in the genus \"Synalpheus\". The species \"Synalpheus regalis\" lives inside sponges in colonies that can number over 300 members. All of them are the offspring of a single large female, the queen, and possibly a single male. The offspring are divided into workers who care for the young and predominantly male soldiers who protect the colony with their huge claws.\n\nPistol shrimp have also been noted for their ability to reverse claws. When the snapping claw is lost, the missing limb will regenerate into a smaller claw and the original smaller appendage will grow into a new snapping claw. Laboratory research has shown that severing the nerve of the snapping claw induces the conversion of the smaller limb into a second snapping claw. This phenomenon of claw symmetry in snapping shrimp has only been documented once in nature.\n\nThe snapping shrimp competes with much larger animals such as the sperm whale and beluga whale for the title of loudest animal in the sea. The animal snaps a specialized claw shut to create a cavitation bubble that generates acoustic pressures of up to 80 kPa at a distance of 4 cm from the claw. As it extends out from the claw, the bubble reaches speeds of and releases a sound reaching 218 decibels. The pressure is strong enough to kill small fish. It corresponds to a zero to peak pressure level of 218 decibels relative to one micropascal (dB re 1 μPa), equivalent to a zero to peak source level of 190 dB re 1 μPa m. Au and Banks measured peak to peak source levels between 185 and 190 dB re 1 μPa m, depending on the size of the claw. Similar values are reported by Ferguson and Cleary. The duration of the click is less than 1 millisecond.\n\nThe snap can also produce sonoluminescence from the collapsing cavitation bubble. As it collapses, the cavitation bubble reaches temperatures of over . In comparison, the surface temperature of the sun is estimated to be around . The light is of lower intensity than the light produced by typical sonoluminescence and is not visible to the naked eye. It is most likely a by-product of the shock wave with no biological significance. However, it was the first known instance of an animal producing light by this effect. It has subsequently been discovered that another group of crustaceans, the mantis shrimp, contains species whose club-like forelimbs can strike so quickly and with such force as to induce sonoluminescent cavitation bubbles upon impact.\n\nThe snapping is used for hunting (hence the alternative name \"pistol shrimp\"), as well as for communication. When hunting, the shrimp usually lies in an obscured spot, such as a burrow. The shrimp then extends its antennae outwards to determine if any fish are passing by. Once it feels movement, the shrimp inches out of its hiding place, pulls back its claw, and releases a \"shot\" which stuns the prey; the shrimp then pulls it to the burrow and feeds on it.\n\nWhen in colonies, the snapping shrimp can interfere with sonar and underwater communication. The shrimp are a major source of noise in the ocean and can interfere with anti-submarine warfare.\n\nMore than 620 species are currently recognised in the family Alpheidae, distributed among 45 genera. The largest of these are \"Alpheus\", with 283 species, and \"Synalpheus\", with 146 species.\n\n\n"}

He is also the progenitor of the Dowlatshahi Family of Persia. He was born at Nava, in Mazandaran, a Caspian province in the north of Iran. He was the first son of Fath-Ali Shah, the second Qajar king of Persia, and Ziba Chehr Khanoum, a Georgian slave girl of the Tsikarashvili family. He was also the elder brother (by seven months) of Abbas Mirza. Dowlatshah was the governor of Fars at age 9, Qazvin and Gilan at age 11, Khuzestan and Lorestan at age 16, and Kermanshah at age 19.\n\nIn the battles with Russia and Persia's archrival, the Ottoman Empire, he defeated the Ottomans in Baghdad and Basra, and crushed the Russians in Yerevan and Tbilisi. Dowlatshah developed and improved the city of Kermanshah and established the city of Dowlat-Abad which was renamed Malayer.\n\nDowlatshah had 10 sons. His descendants live in different countries in the world and carry the last names دولتشاهی (Persian spelling), Dowlatshahi (English spelling), Dolatshahi (Latin spelling) and Doulatchahi (French spelling).\n\nThough older than his brother Abbas Mirza, Mohammad Ali Mirza Dowlatash was never heir to the Persian throne, because his mother was not of the royal dynasty. However, his father Fath-Ali Shah appointed Dowlatshah to rule and protect the boundaries of the two Iraqs (a name given to western states of Iran) and also adjoined Khuzestan province to his territories. In fact, during Dowlatshah's time, Kermanshah had become a citadel against the Ottomans.\n\nDowlatshah carried the last, and initially very successful, attack on the Ottoman Iraq in 1821. Persia was resentful of the inability of the Ottoman government to protect the Shia population of Iraq against the Saudi-Wahhabi attacks that had begun in 1801. Many of the Shias killed in the raids were Iranians, some of whom closely related to the ruling Qajar dynasty of Persia. His forces quickly occupied Shahrazur and Kirkuk, and laid siege to Baghdad.\n\nHis skills and ambitions mirrored those of his younger brother. He was a great military leader and a patron of the arts, poetry and philosophy. The origin of the family names \"Dowlatshah,\" \"Dowlatshahi,\" and close variations such as \"Dolatshahi\" are from this ancestor's title.\n\nDowlatshah has been greatly respected among the people of Kermanshah (Persian People, Kurds, Lors and Laks), mainly because of his contributions such as Dowlatshah mosque (مسجد دولتشاه) His mosque is located in the Javanshir Square of Kermanshah and was built in the years 1820–1822 AD. In recent years this mosque has been repaired. It consists of separate nocturnal areas along with a courtyard.\n\nThe city of Kermanshah is located in the center of the province and has a temperate climate. It is one of the ancient cities of Iran and it is said that Tahmores Divband, a mythical ruler of the Pishdadian, had constructed it. Some attribute its constructions to Bahram Sassanid. During the reign of Qobad I and Anushirvan Sassanid, Kermanshah was at the peak of its glory. But in the Arab attack suffered great damage. Concurrent with the Afghan attack and the fall of Esfahan, Kermanshah was destroyed due to the Ottoman invasion. But from the beginning of the 11th century AH it began to flourish.\n\nIn order to prevent a probable aggression of the Zangeneh tribe and due to its proximity with the Ottoman Empire, the Safavid ruler paid great attention to this city. But in the Zandieh period upheavals increased, whereas during the Qajar era, Ottoman attacks reduced. Mohammad Ali Mirza in 1221 AH was seated in Kermanshah in order to prevent Ottoman aggression, and Khuzestan also came under his realm. An epigraph of Mohammad Ali Mirza in Taq-e-Bostan has been remained as a relic.\n\nThe regime of Crown Prince Abbas Mirza launched an attack on Ottoman Turkey under the leadership of Mohammad Ali Mirza Dowlatshah. The war was sparked by Turkish aid to Azerbaijani rebels in Persia. The rebels had fled from Persia and were given refuge by the Ottomans. The war opened with a Persian invasion of Turkey in the Lake Van region, and a counter-invasion by the Ottoman Pasha of Baghdad (Iraq belonged to the Ottoman Empire), who invaded western Persia. This invasion force was driven back across the border, but Dowlatshah's newly modernized army of 30,000 troops defeated 50,000 Ottoman Turks in the Battle of Erzurum near Lake Van in 1821. A peace treaty in 1823 ended the war with no changes to their mutual border.\n\nMohammad Ali Mirza Dowlatshah had 12 daughters and 10 sons.\n\n\n\n\n"}

UNESCO added the \"Salines Royales\" to its List of World Heritage Sites in 1982.\n\nToday, the site is mostly open to the public. It includes, in the building the coopers used, displays by the Ledoux Museum of other futuristic projects that were never built. Also, the salt production buildings house temporary exhibitions.\n\nThe train line from Besançon to Bourg-en-Bresse passes just next to the salt works. The station for Arc-et-Senans is only a few dozen meters from the site.\n\nIn the 18th century salt was an essential and valuable commodity. At the time, salt was widely used for the preservation of foods such as meat or fish. The ubiquity of salt use caused the French government to impose the gabelle, a tax on salt consumption. The government mandated that all people over the age of 8 years buy an amount of salt per year at a price that the government had set. The \"Ferme Générale\" was responsible for collecting the \"gabelle\".\n\nAs a region, Franche-Comté was relatively well-endowed with salt springs due to subterranean seams of halite. Consequently, there were a number of small salt works, such as those at Salins-les-Bains and Montmorot, that extracted salt by boiling water over wood fires. The salt works stood close to the springs and drew on wood brought from nearby forests. After many years of exploitation, the forests were becoming more and more rapidly denuded, with the result that wood had to be brought from farther and farther away, at greater and greater cost. Furthermore, over time the salt content of the brine was dropping. This led the experts of the \"Ferme Générale\" to consider exploiting even small springs, an initiative that the King's council stopped in April 1773. Part of the problem was that it was impossible to build evaporation buildings because Salins-les-Bains sat in a small valley.\n\nThe \"Fermiers Généraux\" decided to explore a more mechanised and efficient method of extraction. The concept was to construct a purpose-built factory near the forest of Chaux in the Val d'Amour, i.e., with the brine was to be brought to the factory by a newly constructed canal.\n\nOn September 20, 1771, Louis XV appointed Ledoux Commissioner of the Salt Works of Lorraine and Franché-Comté. As Commissioner, Ledoux was responsible for inspecting the different saltworks in eastern France. This gave him an opportunity to see many different saltworks, including those at Salins-les-Bains and Lons-le-Saunier, and to learn from them what one might want if designing a factory from scratch.\n\nTwo years later, Madame du Barry supported Ledoux's nomination to membership in the Royal Academie of Architecture. This permitted him to style himself as Royal Architect. (He was already the architect for the \"Ferme générale\", the private customs and excise operation that collected many taxes on behalf of the king, under 6-year contracts.) It was on the basis of his positions as Inspector of the Saltworks and as Royal Architect that he received the commission to design the Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans.\n\nWithout even having received any request from the king, Ledoux decided to design a saltworks. The project was something of an abstraction as he had no site in mind. He presented the resulting project in April 1774 to Louis XV.\n\nUnconstrained by any practical considerations, the project was ambitious, innovative, and a break with traditional approaches. What Ledoux did was to impose a rigid geometry on the overall design. The buildings were placed around the edges of an immense square, and linked to each other by porticoes; no building stood in isolation. To speed connections between buildings, Ledoux introduced covered arcades that linked the midpoints of adjacent sides, forming a square within the square. Columns abounded. The buildings themselves were replete with them, and 144 Doric columns supported the covered arcades.\n\nLedoux's plan envisaged that the central square courtyard would be where the factory would keep its firewood. At each corner of the square, and at the midpoints of each side stood two-story, square buildings that would house the various parts of the operation. In front were the quarters for the guards, a chapel, and a bakery. On the sides were workshops for the coopers and other workmen. At the base was the factory itself. Gardens were to surround the site to provide the workers with a supplement to their income. Lastly, a wall would surround the entire complex to protect it from theft.\n\nIt was the project's grandiose vision that blocked its realization. No industrial building of the period was equally imposing. The king rejected the project. He particularly objected to the extensive use of columns, features that he felt were more appropriate for churches and palaces. He also objected to the chapel being relegated to a corner.\n\nIn his own critical review of the project, Ledoux stated that he had put too much weight on the conventions of a factory to the neglect of symbolic aspects. The result was a flat, uniform design based on bi-lateral symmetry, rather than one that would have a marked center of gravity. The design also recalled the traditional communal buildings of the time such as convents, monasteries, hospitals, large farms, and the like. Furthermore, since ancient times, architects had recognized that plans such as Ledoux's were vulnerable to the spread of fire and not very hygienic, with throughout the day some part of the site being in the shade. Lastly, critics pointed out that the project did not take into account the geographic or geological constraints.\n\nLedoux designed the semicircular complex to reflect a hierarchical organization of work. The complete plan included the building of an ideal city forming a perfect circle, like that of the sun. Louis XV had signed the edict authorizing the construction of the saltworks on 29 April 1773, and after approval of Ledoux' second design, construction began in 1775. The city was never started, however. All that was completed was the diameter and a semicircle of buildings of the saltworks.\n\nIn the second design, the entrance building sits at the midpoint of the semicircle and contains on one side guardrooms and on the other a prison and a forge. Other buildings on the semicircle include on the left, as one faces the entrance, quarters for carpenters and laborers, and on the right, marshals and coopers. At the center of the circle is the house of the Director, which has a belvedere on top. A monumental staircase led to a chapel that was destroyed by fire in 1918, following a lightning strike. On either side of the Director's house are the saltworks themselves. These two buildings are 80 meters long, 28 meters wide, and 20 meters high. They contain the drying ovens, the heating pots, the \"Sales des Bosses\", and the salt stores. At each intersection of the diameter and the semicircle sit buildings that housed the works' clerks. Behind the Director's house there is an elegant, small stables for the Director's horses.\n\nThe support of salt works by a state monopoly probably explains why this building is so grand. The \"gabelle\" was very unpopular and was one of the complaints that led to the French Revolution. The Revolution itself probably curtailed the building of the ideal city.\n\nThe salt works produced 40,000 quintals of salt per year at its peak, all of which was exported to Switzerland. All production ceased in 1895 following a lawsuit that the inhabitants of Arc-and-Senans initiated, protesting the pollution of nearby wells. At the same time, the salt works was having difficulty in the face of competition from sea salt brought by rail.\n\nAs mentioned above, a lightning bolt in 1918 destroyed the chapel. In April 1926, some of the buildings were dynamited, and many of the trees on the site were cut down. Still, on November 30, 1926, after a review that began in 1923, the Commission for Monuments declared the central pavilion and the entryway historical monuments. The Society for the Eastern Saltworks, still the owner of the Arc-et-Senans site, was not pleased with the decision. On 10 June 1927 the department of Doubs acquired the salt works and commenced restoration work in 1930.\n\nDuring 1938, the site housed a camp for Spanish Republican refugees. Then, during October 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, the French military installed an anti-aircraft battery in the courtyard area. Also, a unit of engineers occupied some of the buildings. Still, February 20, 1940, saw the publication of the official announcement of the classification of the salt works and its surrounding wall as historical monuments.\n\nIn June 1940, German troops took up residence. From May 1941 to September 1943, the French authorities established an internment camp to hold the area's gypsies and others with no fixed address (Centre de Rassemblement des tziganes et nomades).\n\nAfter the war, there was an extensive public campaign by artists, journalists and writers from the region to encourage the authorities to protect the site.\n\nThe Saltworks were a primary location in the 1961 film by Pierre Kast \"La Morte-Saison des amours\" AKA \"The Season for Love\". \n\nIn 1965, Marcel Bluwal used the director's house for the tomb of the Commander in his television adaptation of Molière's \"Dom Juan\".\n\nSince 1973, the royal salt works and the Institut Claude-Nicolas Ledoux have been members of the European network of cultural sites. Then in 1982, UNESCO listed the salt works as a World Heritage Site.\n\nSince June 29, 2009, the salt works at Salins-les-Bains has been added to the listing for Arc-et-Senans in the World Heritage list. It has been the venue for several cultural events and exhibitions in recent years.\n\n"}
{"id": "2111921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111921", "title": "Para Hills, South Australia", "text": "Para Hills, South Australia\n\nPara Hills is a residential suburb of Adelaide, South Australia. There is a light aircraft airport close to its boundary, and numerous sporting facilities, abundant parks and schools and two medium-sized shopping centres. Most of the suburb is in the City of Salisbury while some is in the City of Tea Tree Gully.\n\nThe prefix \"Para\" is derived from the Kaurna word \"Pari\" meaning \"a stream of flowing water\", which could refer to either the Little Para River or Dry Creek. Para is used to name many places in the area including Parafield Airport, three seasonal creeks, and some suburbs. The flat land between Dry Creek and the Little Para River is sometimes called the Para Plains and the facing hills the Para Hills. \n\nAn early settler family were the Goodalls, who established a farm at the base of the hills in 1850. When Andrew Melville Goodall expanded the farm in 1853 he named the property \"Para Hills Farm\", building a farmhouse near what is now the corner of St Clair Avenue and Goodall Road.\n\nPara Hills Post Office opened on 28 June 1961.\n\nPara Hills is built on an escarpment of the Para Fault Block at the edge of the Adelaide plains, rising above the plains. The formation of this escarpment has led to short, steep-sided gullies which are characteristic of Para Hills. The gullies are usually dry, running only shortly after rain, and have mostly been left as public parks. Outcrops of exposed pre-Cambrian rocks have been quarried for use in roadmaking and construction since the late 19th century. The outcrops within Para Hills are not extensive and only one quarry operated in the suburb's residential area.\n\nPrior to subdivision there is very little recorded about the vegetation of the hills. What records exist report that the plains where mostly covered in kangaroo grass, with the hills being lightly covered in Eucalyptus Porosa (Mallee box), Acacia paradoxa (Kangaroo thorn wattle) and Acacia pyncantha (Golden Wattle). Public parks in para hills are now landscaped with Australian native vegetation. Most of the streets show Salisbury council’s practice of lining roadsides with Eucalypts, Acacias and other Australian native trees. \n\nThe boundary of Para Hills is defined by McIntyre Road and the Para Hills reserve to the north, Kelly Road to the east, Bridge Road to the west, and Maxwell Road and Milne Road to the south. The northern boundary moved south from Wynn Vale Drive in 2002 when Gulfview Heights was declared.\n\nAt the ABS 2001 census, Para Hills had a population of 9,050 people living in 3,505 dwellings, but this has been reduced with the movement of the suburb's boundary.\n\nThe area was originally inhabited by the Kaurna tribe of Indigenous Australians. By the time the area was settled by Europeans in the 1840s, introduced diseases such as smallpox had already spread from the eastern states and decimated the population.\n\nLand grants in the Para Hills area began in 1847. Notable farming families first settling the area were the Goodalls (on 12 August 1850), the Kesters (1893), and the MacIntyres (1865). From settlement as distant farming land, to subdivision for residential development, the land increased greatly in value. The land was valued at £4.10 per acre in 1900, £16 in 1937, £420 and £1200 for some of the flatter land shortly after its subdivision.\n\nFarming and quarrying continued, as the sole activities on the land, until Reid Murray Developments (R.M.D.) began acquiring land for subdivision in 1959. The development was, at the time, the largest private housing development in Australia and had a budget of £6 million. R.M.D. was not the only developer active in the suburb with most of the Goodall and McIntyre farmland being sold to, or subdivided by, other companies. In total R.M.D. purchased . R.M.D. copied a new concept from the South Australian Housing Trust's new development at Elizabeth, constructing the suburb as a self-contained neighborhood from the outset. Unusually fifteen percent of the land was set aside for parks, arrangements were made with Woolworths (S.A.) Ltd to provide a supermarket, and with the State government for the speedy provision of a post office and school. Land allotments were set to a minimum of and, to transform the bare farm land, a street tree-planting and nursery program was begun with new residents being given six plants to start a garden. R.M.D. did not sell any vacant land, but only complete house, land and some furnishings packages (prices ranging from £4,000 to £5,500). The houses all had three or more bedrooms, flat corrugated iron or angled tile roofs, and were constructed from bricks, modular concrete blocks or Mount Gambier freestone.\n\nR.M.D. set up offices in London to attract new British migrants prior to their trip to Australia. Salesmen met new immigrants at Fremantle dock. Flats were built in Barcoo Street to temporarily house intending purchasers, many of whom were travelling under assisted passage. Some settlers were not prepared for the frontier conditions they met, with no amenities or trees, and surroundings of little more than open paddocks. Many of the migrants came from established cities, and expressed dismay at the prospect of having to form a community from scratch. A vendor finance scheme was begun allowing a some newlyweds to purchase homes with a deposit as low as £500. An extensive marketing effort to sell the homes included, a home donated to the crippled children's association, subsidised bus services, free use of the olympic size swimming pool for residents, twenty-five furnished display homes and £10,000 of Television advertising.\n\nThe suburb developed quickly, fifty-five homes completed in the first six months and seventy under construction, along with sealed roads, storm water and sewerage services and gas and electricity supply. All three original farming families have main roads in Para Hills named after them. The farmhouse of Allen Kesters (built in 1934) is still in use, on the corner of Kesters and Bridge roads as a real-estate office, and the McIntyre farmhouse was, as of 1985, occupied by the McIntyre family.\n\n\"29 October 1846\", Hundred of Yatala proclaimed and area divided into sections.\n\"July 1847\", First land grants acquired.\n\"1850\", Goodall family acquire a land grant and begin farming.\n\"1852\", McIntyre family begin leasing farming land.\n\"1893\", Kesters family acquire land and establish a farm.\n\"1911\", First (two inch) water main laid down Kesters Road.\n\"1934\", Allen Kester’s house built on the corner of Kesters and Bridge Road.\n\"1950’s (year unknown)\", Electricity supply begun after formation of the Electricity Trust of South Australia.\n\"1959\", All Kesters family land purchased by R.M.D.\n\"25 February 1960\", Construction of first house begun with pouring of the concrete foundation.\n\"2 August 1960\", Premier Sir Thomas Playford officially opens the new housing estate.\n\"February 1961\", First school lessons begin in pre-fabricated classrooms in the site of current day Para Hills Primary School.\n\"March 1961\", 100th family arrives in the Para Hills estate.\n\"27 June 1961\", First scouting meeting with the formation of a cub pack.\n\"24 February 1962\", 1/2 Olympic size swimming pool and community hall opened.\n\"September 1963\", Presbyterian Church on the corner of Barcoo Streets and Liberman roads begins services.\n\"12 September 1963\", Shopping centre opens on Wilkinson Road.\n\"1964\", Goodall farm including Para Hills farm purchased by R.M.D.\n\"1964\", Para Hills Farm's farmhouse demolished to make way for subdivision.\n\"17 June 1968\", First Para Hills library opened by Premier Steele Hall.\n\"27 April 1972\", Para Hills police station opens\n\"1976\", Population reaches 11,213.\n\nThe suburb of Para Hills also has a school R-7, and was made in 1961 so it is over 47 years old. The school is on Francis Ave.\n\nPara Hills was used to showcase an 'expandable house' that allowed for rooms to be added in four stages. The house was part of the Housing Trust of South Australia's demonstration village opened in 1982.\n\nThe suburb is accessible from Adelaide by bus, (partly using Adelaide's O-Bahn Busway). A train station is approximately 2 kilometres to the west.\n\nPublic transport began in 1961 with a once-daily, privately run return bus service to Adelaide. The service was run by \"Lewis Brothers\", initially with a £60 weekly subsidy from Reid Murray Developments. By 1974, when the Municipal Tramways Trust took over all buses and services in Para Hills, it had expanded to 44 buses and numerous routes.\n\nBus routes in Para Hills provide connections to Elizabeth Shopping Centre, Lyell McEwin Hospital, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Women's and Children's Hospital and Westfield Tea Tree Plaza\n\n"}

While teaming in the original ECW, the duo was managed by Bill Alfonso.\n\nRob Van Dam and Sabu first met in December 1989 and became close friends. The pair started out as enemies in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), when Rob Van Dam debuted in 1996. Both men were trained by Sabu's uncle, The Sheik, and fans wanted to see them face each other since they both utilized high-flying, daredevil techniques.\n\nIn 1997, they eventually became a tag team as they went for the ECW World Tag Team Championship. At ECW Barely Legal, Bill Alfonso betrayed Taz and joined Van Dam and Sabu. Four months later, Van Dam helped Sabu beat Terry Funk in a barbed wire match to capture the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. After Sabu lost the belt in a three-way dance with Terry Funk and Shane Douglas at ECW Hardcore Heaven, Sabu and Van Dam joined Jerry Lawler in his crusade to \"kill\" ECW. When the crusade ultimately failed, Sabu eventually set his sights on Bam Bam Bigelow's ECW World Television Championship. So Bill Alfonso helped schedule a match between Bigelow and Van Dam, so that the latter could \"soften\" Bigelow before Sabu would face him at Wrestlepalooza 1998. When Sabu interfered in the match, however, he \"accidentally\" helped Van Dam win the title, so the two then faced each other at Wrestlepalooza. The match ended in a 30-minute draw, preventing title from changing hands. A month later, the two captured the ECW World Tag Team Championship when they defeated Chris Candido and Lance Storm. As champions, Sabu and Van Dam took on all challengers including Jinsei Shinzaki and Hayabusa at Heat Wave 1998 in Dayton, Ohio. They lost the titles to The Dudley Boyz in October 1998; however, yet they went on to win them back from the Dudleyz in December at ECW/FMW Supershow.\n\nAfter they lost the titles again to The Dudley Boyz, The Impact Players formed and started to attack Sabu and Van Dam. When Sabu broke his jaw, the Impact Players had him eventually banned because of his injury and because he was too \"dangerous\" or \"violent.\" Sabu returned, and after his loss to Justin Credible at Anarchy Rulz 1999, Sabu started to attack Van Dam because he was still jealous that Van Dam was the ECW World Television Champion, and they would face each other at Guilty as Charged 2000. Sabu proclaimed before the match that if he could not win the belt, he would leave ECW. That night, Van Dam defeated Sabu with the Five Star Frog Splash, forcing Sabu to leave the company.\n\nSeveral years after ECW folded, Rob Van Dam and Sabu reunited at World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) produced ECW One Night Stand in 2005, when Van Dam helped Sabu defeat another former ECW wrestler, Rhyno. When ECW became the third WWE brand (to Raw and SmackDown), Van Dam and Sabu became a major part of the show and teamed on several occasions, including an Extreme Rules match against Test and Mike Knox on September 5, 2006. The team also became part of ECW Originals stable in 2006 which feuded with The New Breed. On March 31, 2007, Van Dam and Sabu and inducted The Original Sheik into the WWE Hall of Fame. The following night, at WrestleMania 23, ECW Originals defeated The New Breed but continued battling them into spring. In May 2007, Sabu was released from WWE. Van Dam's WWE contract expired in June 2007, and he chose not to renew it.\n\nOn August 8, 2010, Sabu returned to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) at Hardcore Justice, where he was defeated by Rob Van Dam in the main event of the evening. Van Dam and Sabu both then went on to join EV 2.0, a stable consisting of former ECW wrestlers. On the October 21 episode of \"TNA Impact!\", Van Dam and Sabu were defeated in a tag team match by Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode), after Sabu accidentally hit his own partner with a chair. After the match, Van Dam and Sabu began shoving each other, before being broken up by the rest of EV 2.0. In November 2010, Sabu was released from TNA, as was Van Dam in March 2013.\n\nOn February 8, 2019, it was revealed that both Rob Van Dam and Sabu would return to TNA, now named Impact Wrestling, at their following pay-per-view United We Stand. At the event on April 4, 2019, the team will tag for the first time since 2015, facing Lucha Bros (Pentagón Jr. and Fénix).\n\n\n"}

It is the main business and entertainment precinct of the Wingecarribee Shire and Highlands. At the , the population of the Bowral area was 12,949.\n\nIn the past, Bowral served as a rural summer retreat for the gentry of Sydney, resulting in the establishment of a number of estates and manor houses in the district. Today, it is considered a \"dormitory suburb\" for commuter Sydneysiders, though it is 136 km away from the city centre. Bowral is often associated with the cricketer Sir Donald Bradman.\n\nBowral is close to several other historic towns, being from Mittagong, from both Moss Vale and Berrima. The suburb of East Bowral and the village of Burradoo are nearby.\n\nBowral's history extends back for approximately 200 years. During the pre-colonial era, the land was home to an Aboriginal tribe known as Tharawal. The first European arrival was ex-convict John Wilson, who was commissioned by Governor Hunter to explore south of the new colony of Sydney. Other people to traverse the area include John Warby and botanist George Caley (an associate of Joseph Banks), the Hume brothers and later famous pioneer explorers John Oxley and Charles Throsby. Governor Lachlan Macquarie of the New South Wales colony had appointed to John Oxley in a land grant, which was later incorporated as Bowral.\n\nThe town grew rapidly between the 1860s and the 1890s, mainly due to the building of the railway line from Sydney to Melbourne. In 1863, a permanent stone building was built for the church. However, the building would be replaced by the first Anglican church of St Simon and St Jude. The church was designed by Edmund Blacket and was built on the glebe in 1874. The church was expanded in 1887 to cater for a growing number of worshippers. Today, only Blackett's belltower remains. One of the earliest houses built as a mountain retreat was Craigieburn which was constructed in 1885.\n\nGardens and European plants flourished from 1887, when citizens of Bowral started planting deciduous trees to make the area look more British. This legacy still lives on throughout Bowral. Notably, the oaks at the start of Bong Bong St are a characteristic that makes Bowral distinct from other rural towns, giving it strong autumn colour. The town became somewhat affluent, as many wealthy Sydney-siders purchased property or land in the town and built grand Victorian weatherboard homes.\n\nBowral has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nBowral and the former spelling \"Bowrall\". may have been derived from an Aboriginal word meaning \"high and large\".\n\nAt the , the Bowral area, including Burradoo, had a population of 12,949. A more local area had a population of 10,335.\n\n74.7% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 7.0% and New Zealand 1.6% and 88.4% of people spoke only English at home. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 0.9% of Bowral's population. The most common responses for religion in Bowral were Anglican 26.2%, No Religion 24.2% and Catholic 22.7%.\n\nIn the 21st century, Bowral has become a haven for retirees and empty nesters, commonly from Sydney: 13.3% of Bowral's population is aged 55–64 years (compared with the national average of 11.8%) and 35.5% is aged over 64 years (compared with the national average of 15.8%). Consequently, the town has a number of retirement villages, some located only minutes' walk from the central business district and hospitals. Also, as measured during the 2016 census, 38.7% of the town's population are under the age of 45, whereas for the nation the figure is 59.4%.\n\nBowral is about from the Hume Highway, which goes north to Sydney and south to Canberra, the Snowy Mountains and Melbourne. In the past, Bowral served as an overnight stop-over for travellers.\n\nBowral railway station is served by the Southern Highlands Line with services between Sydney and Moss Vale or Goulburn. Long distance services operate to Canberra and Melbourne.\n\nIt has public bus routes to Nowra, Albion Park and Wollongong.

A second album for Mercury, \"Men & Mascara\", followed in 2006. This album produced two non-charting singles in its title track and a cover of Saving Jane's \"Girl Next Door\".\n\nIn 2013, she took part in the Blind Auditions of fourth season of the reality television show \"The Voice\" but failed to qualify. Her comeback album \"Good Wine & Bad Decision\" charted on both US Country Albums chart and the US Indie Albums charts.\n\nRoberts has multiple sclerosis.\n\nJulie Roberts was born in Lancaster, South Carolina, United States, in 1979. The daughter of an engineer and accountant, she began her life performing in pre-school plays. She also was in school choirs and performed in a rendition of \"My Fair Lady\" at a singing summer camp. Roberts began performing country music as a child. When she was in junior high and high school, she toured with her family, playing at festivals in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. She also performed at area nursing homes (where she developed an appreciation for blues music); and worked at Carowinds (a theme park in Charlotte, North Carolina) and Dollywood.

Roberts released her self-titled debut album on May 25, 2004. It charted within the Top 10 of the \"Billboard\" Top Country Albums chart, peaking at No. 9. \"Break Down Here\" became a Top 20 single on the Hot Country Songs chart, however, she never charted within the Top 40 after that. The two follow-up singles, \"The Chance\" and \"Wake Up Older\", peaked at No. 47 and No. 46 on the country charts, respectively. The album was then certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on December 13, 2004.\n\nIn 2006, she released her fourth single, \"Men & Mascara\", which would in-turn be the title track to her second album. \"Men & Mascara\" was released on June 27, 2006.

The first Two Harbors keeper was Charles Lederle and there were normally three keepers assigned to make sure the light was lit every day.

{"id": "2111983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111983", "title": "Starlog", "text": "Starlog\n\nStarlog was a monthly science fiction magazine that was created in 1976 and focused primarily on \"Star Trek\" at its inception. Kerry O'Quinn and Norman Jacobs were its creators and it was published by Starlog Group, Inc. in August 1976. \"Starlog\" was one of the first publications to report on the development of the first \"Star Wars\" movie, and it followed the development of what was to eventually become \"\" (1979).\n\n\"Starlog\" was born out of the \"Star Trek\" fandom craze, but also was inspired by the success of the magazine \"Cinefantastique\" which was the model of \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Wars\" coverage. \"Starlog\", though it called itself a science fiction magazine, actually contained no fiction. The primary focus of the magazine, besides the fact that it was mostly based on \"Star Trek\" fandom, was the making of science fiction media - books, films, and television series - and the work that went into these creations. The magazine examined the form of science fiction and used interviews and features with artists and writers as its foundation.\n\nScience fiction fans, such as those who follow the television channel SYFY, have voiced that \"Starlog\" is the science fiction magazine most responsible for cultivating and exhibiting fanboy culture in America during the magazine’s heyday in the 1970s through the early 1990s. Not only did the magazine cover media, the way it was created, and by whom, but they also attended conventions such as the “Ultimate Fantasy” convention in Houston, Texas in 1982 (which was a legendary flop) and kept fans updated on the current events in their respective sci-fi fandoms. \"Starlog\" itself followed the marketing strategy of labeling it “the most popular science fiction magazine in publishing history” which allowed the creators to home in on their fanboy market and use that advertisement strategy to their advantage. In later years many of its long-time contributors had moved on. Nonetheless, it continued to boast genre journalists such as Jean-Marc Lofficier, Will Murray, and Tom Weaver.\n\n\"Starlog\" ended its run as a digital magazine published by The Brooklyn Company, run by longtime \"Fangoria\" President Thomas DeFeo. In April 2009, Starlog officially ended its time in print, moving 33 years of material (374 issues) into the Internet Archive where the issues are still available today in digital form. Though no new issues were created, all the past issues have been uploaded by users and are downloadable in multiple formats.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Kerry O'Quinn and his high school friend David Houston talked about creating a magazine that would cover science fiction films and television programs. (O'Quinn and Norman Jacobs had gotten their start in creating and publishing a soap opera magazine.)\n\nO'Quinn came up the idea of publishing a one-time-only magazine on the \"Star Trek\" phenomenon. Houston's editorial assistant, Kirsten Russell, suggested that they include an episode guide to all three seasons of the show, interviews with the cast, and previously unpublished photographs. During this brainstorming session many questions were raised, most notably legal issues. Houston contacted \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry with the intention of interviewing him for the magazine. Once they got his approval, O'Quinn and Jacobs proceeded to put together the magazine, but Paramount Studios, which owned \"Star Trek\", wanted a minimum royalty that was greater than the startup's projected net receipts, and the project was shelved.\n\nO'Quinn realized they could create a magazine that featured only \"Star Trek\" content, but without its being the focus, and thereby circumvent the royalties issue. He also realized this could be the science fiction magazine he and Houston had talked about. Many titles for the new magazine were suggested, including \"Fantastic Films\" and \"Starflight\", before \"Starlog\" was chosen. (\"Fantastic Films\" was later used as the title of a competing science fiction magazine published by Blake Publishing.)\n\nThe first issue of \"Starlog\", scheduled as a quarterly, was dated August 1976. While the cover featured Captain Kirk, Spock, and the \"Enterprise\", and the issue contained a \"Special Collector's Section\" on \"Star Trek\", other science fiction topics were also discussed, such as \"The Bionic Woman\" and \"\". The issue sold out, and this encouraged O'Quinn and Jacobs to publish a magazine every six weeks instead of quarterly. O'Quinn was the magazine's editor, while Jacobs ran the business side of things, dealing with typesetters, engravers and printers.\n\nOne of the magazine's milestones was its 100th issue, published in November 1985. It featured the 100 most important people in science fiction as determined by the editors. This included exclusive interviews with John Carpenter, Peter Cushing, George Lucas, Harlan Ellison, Leonard Nimoy, and Gene Roddenberry.\n\nIn 1985 and 1986, \"Starlog\" teamed with Creation Entertainment to produce a series of conventions called the Starlog SF, Horror & Fantasy Festival. (Starlog produced other small-scale conventions during this period, as well.) The first show was held March 30–31, 1985, at the Boston Sheraton in Boston. Others were held June 15–16, 1985, at the Center Hotel, Philadelphia, and May 10–11, 1986, at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City. Nicholas Courtney of \"Doctor Who\" fame was a guest at all three shows.\n\nThe magazine's 200th issue repeated the format of the 100th issue, but this time interviewed such notable artists as Arthur C. Clarke, Tim Burton, William Gibson, Gale Anne Hurd, and Terry Gilliam.\n\nThe last issue of Starlog, issue 374, published in April 2009 features more modern science fiction media including the television show \"Fringe\", an American movie \"Push\", and the animated stop-motion film, \"Coraline\".\n\nAfter the entire magazine industry took a serious tumble in 2001, Starlog Group was eventually purchased by Creative Group, Inc., which continued to publish \"Starlog\" and \"Fangoria\", and expanded its franchises into the Internet, satellite radio, TV, and video.\n\n\"Starlog\" published its 30th Anniversary issue in 2006.\n\nOn December 5, 2007, a warehouse operated by Kable News, in Oregon, Illinois, which contained all back issues of \"Starlog\" and \"Fangoria\" magazines, was destroyed by fire. As back issues of \"Starlog\" are not re-printed, the only remaining back issues are now housed in private collections or those available on the secondary market.\n\n\"Starlog\" publisher Creative Media filed for bankruptcy in March 2008, and, in June 2008, sold its assets to a group led by private equity firm Scorpion Capital Partners LP. \"Starlog\" and \"Fangoria\" and all related assets were purchased by The Brooklyn Company, Inc. in July 2008. The official website at Starlog.com ceased to operate in December 2008.\n\nIn March 2009, \"Starlog\" became a sister site to \"Fangoria\" magazine's official site, with a new web address tied to \"Fangoria\". Simultaneously, production was halted on issue #375, scheduled for May 2009. New content began to appear on the \"Starlog\" website on April 7, 2009, after the site returned to its original Starlog.com domain. , the Starlog.com domain is still held by Starlog, but is empty except for the Starlog logo and galaxy background. In order to access Starlog magazine, readers must access it through the Internet Archive. The folding of the print edition was officially announced on April 8, 2009, with the unpublished issue promised in the near future as a web-only publication.\n\nIn April 2014, \"Fangoria\" announced that \"Starlog\" would return in the summer of 2014, first as a relaunched website and later in the year as a digital magazine. No new issues of the magazine were created.\n\nO'Quinn was the magazine's first editor. Houston took over for a year, and O'Quinn's successor was Howard Zimmerman, when Houston was promoted to the \"Hollywood Bureau\". Zimmerman was eventually succeeded by David McDonnell, who was the final editor of the web-based science fiction magazine.\n\nIn addition to \"Starlog\", O'Quinn and Jacobs published dozens of magazines, including the science/science-fiction hybrid \"Future Life\", \"Comics Scene\", \"Cinemagic,\" and \"Fangoria\", which is dedicated to horror films. Over the past 30 years, \"Starlog\" has produced books, videos, science fiction conventions, trivia books, and more. It has also had a number of foreign editions, in such countries as Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, and the UK. \"Starlog\" also spun off a number of related publications, including the \"Starlog Poster Magazine\", \"Starlog Science-Fiction Explorer\", \"Starlog Presents...\", and monthly magazines dedicated to covering the production of \"\", \"\", and \"\".\n\nAs of fall 2015, \"Fangoria\" is the only magazine launched during \"Starlog's\" run that is still in production.\n"}

Tutul, Saidul Hasan Swapan, Habib Anwar Joy formed the band LRB, which stood for Little River Band. But, after Bachchu found out that an Australian rock band had the same name, he changed it to Love Runs Blind. Their first line up included Bachchu on vocals and guitars, S.I. Tutul on keyboards, Swapan on bass, Joy on drums. LRB were invited to perform in a concert in University of Dhaka arranged by BAMBA on 26 April 1991 along with other rock bands like Souls, Feelings, Ark and many other bands.\n\nIn their early days they used to play live shows in Hotel Sheraton and Chambeeli Super Club along with bands like Ark and Feedback. In early 1991, they signed a deal with Sargam and went on to record their albums \"LRB I\" and \"LRB II\", which was the first double album in Bangladesh. The album was released in Cassette format. It included some of the greatest hit songs like \"ঢাকার সন্ধ্যা (Evening of Dhaka)\", \"ঘুম ভাঙ্গা শহরে (In the Woke Up City)\", \"হকার (Hawker)\", \"মা (Mother)\" and \"এক কাপ চা (A Cup of Tea)\".\n\nAfter the release of their double albums, they signed a new contract with Soundtek in the mid 1992 and quickly started to work on their third album \"সুখ (Happiness)\". The album came out in 1993. It was the band's first album to get commercial success. With the power ballad \"চলো বদলে যাই (Let’s Change)\" becoming the most popular rock song of the year, they became one of the best bands of that era. The song became their signature song.

On 8 June 1993, Milton Akbar joined the band as their drummer. In 1994, they released their fourth studio album \"তবুও (Yet)\" from Sargam Records. It included the hit song \"রাত জাগা পাখি (Night Bird)\". Though the album was not as successful like the previous album, it cemented their hard rock status. In January 1994, drummer Milton Akbar left the band and was replaced by Riyad on 31 January 1994.\n\nIn 2012, Ayub Bachchu was admitted to the CCU Hospital in Dhaka for the accretion of water in his lungs. He recovered after receiving treatment. On 18 October 2018, he died from cardiac failure at his own residence.

Bachchu's wife and daughter was not satisfied with the members of the band performing with a new singer under the name LRB. They asked the members to change the name. The band was disbanded for few days and the other members of the band along with Balam formed a new band named, \"Balam and the Legacy\". Bangladesh Copyright Office said that: \"Bachchu is the sole owner of LRB, only his heirs can run the band with the same name.\" On 15 April 2019, Bachchu's son Ahnaf Tazwar Ayub posted in his Facebook account that he was \"okay\" with the other members of the band keeping the name, and later Bachchu's wife and daughter also agreed on it.\n\nLRB is a hard rock band, whose music has often been described as blues rock, soft rock, psychedelic rock.

Their last two studio albums, \"\"যুদ্ধ (War)\"\" (2012) and \"\"রাখে আল্লাহ মারে কে (Allah Keeps, Who Kills)\"\" (2016) mostly consisted heavy metal numbers.\n\nLRB has performed over 1,000 gigs that have included extensive performances in Bangladesh as well as tours in Asia, Europe, and the United States. Their first show outside country was held in India in 1997 at Jadavpur University, where LRB was to perform. But the organisers were a little bit doubtful about the quality of the band. After their performance they request LRB to act as a judge which Ayub Bachchu agreed to comply with. In 1998, LRB went for their first international tour in United States, where they played in seven states. In 1998, the group also played in Qatar, Abudhabi, Japan, Germany, Vienna, Austria, and Italy. The group played a second tour in the United States in 2000. The group had a European tour in 2002, which included Austria, United Kingdom, and Australia.\n\nFrom 2003 through 2006, LRB performed twice in Italy and Belgium. They also performed in many cities in India as well as Germany, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Wembley Arena in London. At Singapore they performed at Fort Canyon Park stage. In 2005 and 2006, LRB performed in Salt Lake Stadium, Science City Theater, Alpha Bangla, ETV Bangla, Najrul Manch, Rabindra Shorobor, Guru Nanak University (Jodhpur), Haldia Utshab, Durgapur University, Kalyani, Govt Engineer College in the fest \"EXOTICA '08\", and recently at NRS Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata in their college fest \"ECSTASY 2013\". LRB has performed in Wimbledon Stadium in London, Madison Square Garden in New York City twice, and Ellin Garden in the United Kingdom.\n\nLRB also has used its music to support social causes in conjunction with other Bengali rock groups. Recently, they performed in support of children endangered by the recent Tsunami and Sidr. Also, they have performed in support of campaigns to \"Say No to Drugs\", \"Save Motherhood\", and \"Victims Against Non-violence\". In 1998 Ayub bachchu released a solo album \"বাঁচাও বিধাতা (Save Me God)\" for the aid of the flood-stricken people of the country.\n\nStudio albums\n\nMeril Prothom Alo Awards\nCitycell-Channel I Music Awards\nPresent\n\n\nPast members\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2111994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111994", "title": "Rayleigh–Ritz method", "text": "Rayleigh–Ritz method\n\nThe Rayleigh–Ritz method is a numerical method of finding approximations to eigenvalue equations that are difficult to solve analytically, particularly in the context of solving physical boundary value problems that can be expressed as matrix differential equations. It is used in mechanical engineering to approximate the eigenmodes of a physical system, such as finding the resonant frequencies of a structure to guide appropriate damping. The name is a common misnomer used to describe the method that is more appropriately termed the Ritz method or the Galerkin method. This method was invented by Walther Ritz in 1909, but it bears some similarity to the Rayleigh quotient and so the misnomer persists.\n\nThe Rayleigh–Ritz method allows for the computation of Ritz pairs formula_1 which approximate the solutions to the eigenvalue problem\n\nwhere formula_3.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n\nOne can always compute the accuracy of such an approximation via formula_8\n\nIf a Krylov subspace is used and A is a general matrix, then this is the Arnoldi algorithm.\n\nIn this technique, we approximate the variational problem and end up with a finite dimensional problem. So let us start with the problem of seeking a function formula_9 that extremizes an integral formula_10. Assume that we are able to approximate y(x) by a linear combination of certain linearly independent functions of the type:\n\nformula_11\n\nwhere formula_12 are constants to be determined by a variational method, such as one which will be described below.\n\nThe selection of which approximating functions formula_13 to use is arbitrary except for the following considerations:\n\na) If the problem has boundary conditions such as fixed end points, then formula_14 is chosen to satisfy the problem’s boundary conditions, and all other formula_13 vanish at the boundary.\n\nb) If the form of the solution is known, then formula_13 can be chosen so that formula_9 will have that form.\n\nThe expansion of formula_9 in terms of approximating functions replaces the variational problem of extremising the functional integral formula_10 to a problem of finding a set of constants formula_12 that extremizes formula_21. We can now solve this by setting the partial derivatives to zero. For each value of i,\n\nformula_22\n\nThe procedure is to first determine an initial estimate of formula_23 by the approximation formula_24. Next, the approximation formula_25 is used (with formula_23 being redetermined). The process continues with formula_27 as the third approximation and so on. At each stage the following two items are true:\n\nConvergence of the procedure means that as i tends to infinity, the approximation will tend towards the exact function formula_9 that extremizes an integral formula_10.\n\nIn many cases one uses a complete set of functions e. g. polynomials or sines and cosines. A set of functions formula_13 is called complete over [a, b] if for each Riemann integrable function formula_35, there is a set of values of coefficients formula_12 that reproduces formula_35.\n\nThe above outlined procedure can be extended to cases with more than one independent variable.\n\nThe Rayleigh–Ritz method is often used in mechanical engineering for finding the approximate real resonant frequencies of multi degree of freedom systems, such as spring mass systems or flywheels on a shaft with varying cross section. It is an extension of Rayleigh's method. It can also be used for finding buckling loads and post-buckling behaviour for columns.\n\nConsider the case whereby we want to find the resonant frequency of oscillation of a system. First, write the oscillation in the form,\n\nformula_38\n\nwith an unknown mode shape formula_39. Next, find the total energy of the system, consisting of a kinetic energy term and a potential energy term. The kinetic energy term involves the square of the time derivative of formula_40 and thus gains a factor of formula_41. Thus, we can calculate the total energy of the system and express it in the following form:\n\nformula_42\n\nBy conservation of energy, the average kinetic energy must be equal to the average potential energy. Thus,\n\nformula_43\n\nwhich is also known as the Rayleigh quotient. Thus, if we knew the mode shape formula_39, we would be able to calculate formula_45 and formula_46, and in turn get the eigenfrequency. However, we do not yet know the mode shape. In order to find this, we can approximate formula_39 as a combination of a few approximating functions formula_48\n\nformula_49\n\nwhere formula_12 are constants to be determined. In general, if we choose a random set of formula_12, it will describe a superposition of the actual eigenmodes of the system. However, if we seek formula_12 such that the eigenfrequency formula_53 is minimised, then the mode described by this set of formula_12 will be close to the lowest possible actual eigenmode of the system. Thus, this finds the lowest eigenfrequency. If we find eigenmodes orthogonal to this approximated lowest eigenmode, we can approximately find the next few eigenfrequencies as well.\n\nIn general, we can express formula_45 and formula_46 as a collection of terms quadratic in the coefficients formula_57:\n\nformula_58\n\nformula_59\n\nThe minimization of formula_53 becomes:\n\nformula_61\n\nSolving this,\n\nformula_62\n\nformula_63\n\nformula_64\n\nFor a non-trivial solution of c, we require determinant of the matrix coefficient of c to be zero.\n\nformula_65\n\nThis gives a solution for the first N eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of the system, with N being the number of approximating functions.\n\nThe following discussion uses the simplest case, where the system has two lumped springs and two lumped masses, and only two mode shapes are assumed. Hence \"M\" = [\"m\", \"m\"] and \"K\" = [\"k\", \"k\"].\n\nA mode shape is assumed for the system, with two terms, one of which is weighted by a factor \"B\", e.g. \"Y\" = [1, 1] + \"B\"[1, −1].\nSimple harmonic motion theory says that the velocity at the time when deflection is zero, is the angular frequency formula_66 times the deflection (y) at time of maximum deflection. In this example the kinetic energy (KE) for each mass is formula_67 etc., and the potential energy (PE) for each spring is formula_68 etc.\n\nWe also know that without damping, the maximal KE equals the maximal PE. Thus,\n\nNote that the overall amplitude of the mode shape cancels out from each side, always. That is, the actual size of the assumed deflection does not matter, just the mode \"shape\".\n\nMathematical manipulations then obtain an expression for formula_66, in terms of B, which can be differentiated with respect to B, to find the minimum, i.e. when formula_71. This gives the value of B for which formula_66 is lowest. This is an upper bound solution for formula_66 if formula_66 is hoped to be the predicted fundamental frequency of the system because the mode shape is \"assumed\", but we have found the lowest value of that upper bound, given our assumptions, because B is used to find the optimal 'mix' of the two assumed mode shape functions.\n\nThere are many tricks with this method, the most important is to try and choose realistic assumed mode shapes. For example, in the case of beam deflection problems it is wise to use a deformed shape that is analytically similar to the expected solution. A quartic may fit most of the easy problems of simply linked beams even if the order of the deformed solution may be lower. The springs and masses do not have to be discrete, they can be continuous (or a mixture), and this method can be easily used in a spreadsheet to find the natural frequencies of quite complex distributed systems, if you can describe the distributed KE and PE terms easily, or else break the continuous elements up into discrete parts.\n\nThis method could be used iteratively, adding additional mode shapes to the previous best solution, or you can build up a long expression with many Bs and many mode shapes, and then differentiate them partially.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2111995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111995", "title": "Meleda disease", "text": "Meleda disease\n\nMeleda disease (MDM) or \"mal de Meleda\", also called Mljet disease, keratosis palmoplantaris and transgradiens of Siemens, (also known as \"acral keratoderma\", \"mutilating palmoplantar keratoderma of the Gamborg-Nielsen type\", \"palmoplantar ectodermal dysplasia type VIII\", and \"palmoplantar keratoderma of the Norrbotten type\") is an extremely rare autosomal recessive congenital skin disorder in which dry, thick patches of skin develop on the soles of the hands and feet, a condition known as palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. Meleda Disease is a skin condition which usually can be identified not long after birth. This is a genetic condition but it is very rare. The hands and feet usually are the first to show signs of the disease but the disease can advance to other parts of the body. Signs of the disease include thickening of the skin, on hands and soles of feet, which can turn red in color. There currently is no cure and treatment is limited, but Acitretin can be used in severe cases. \n\nSkin on the palms of hands and soles of feet have dry, thick patches which progress slowly. The skin that is affected may look red in color and then start becoming abnormally thick and scaly. After birth it usually is obvious whether a child is affected with this disease because the hands or feet will appear to be peeling and could be red in color. \n\nThere is not much variation in this disease besides the skin how red the skin will turn and how much skin will turn thicker. The skin that is affected on the hands and feet can start to look like the affected person is wearing gloves or socks, this is because the affected area on the hands and feet go up to the wrists and ankles, respectively. \n\nOther symptoms can include excessive sweating due to the thick skin affecting sweat glands on the skin; this excessive sweating can cause a person to have bad odor. Severity of symptoms could increase as a person gets older. \n\n\nThis is a skin disorder that is rare and inherited. It caused by genetics and is an autosomal recessive trait therefore, in order to be affected and present the disease each parent must be a carrier of the mutated allele and pass it to their kids. Inbreeding within families can cause Meleda disease to be prevalent. Meleda disease can be associated with other skin conditions such as skin discoloration, skin thickness, and skin peeling. \n\nMeleda disease is a genetic disease but since it is a rare disease the chances of inheriting the disease are not high. Since this is an autosomal recessive disease, two copies of the gene that contain the mutation must be present for one to show signs and symptoms of the disease. In order for one to be affected with the disease, both parents must contain the affected gene and pass it to their child. Even if a person is not affected by the disease, it is possible for them to be heterozygous, and still carry the affected gene and be able to pass it to their children; there would be a 25% chance that the child would actually be affected if both parents were carriers of the disease but did not actually display symptoms of the disease. \n\nMDM is most common on the Dalmatian island of Mljet (or \"Meleda\"), thought to be because of a founder effect. It is of autosomal recessive inheritance. It may be caused by a mutation on the \"SLURP1\" gene, located on chromosome 8. The \"SLURP1\" gene makes a protein called \"SLURP-1,\" and this protein is located in cells of the skin. The protein \"SLURP-1\" helps with cell death regulation and help mediate inflammation that is occurring, this protein is important in keeping the skin cells at a level of homeostasis. A gene mutation would be caused by the chromosome 8qter, which codes for the \"SLURP1\" gene, to be cut, thus causing a mutation in that gene, which would disrupt the way it controls the skin cells.\n\nThe skin abnormalities can be found on a child at birth or during infancy. The abnormalities on the soles of feet or on the palms of hands can be found by the physician during a full examination. Family medical history can help with diagnosing because this is a genetically inherited disease. Overall, the diagnosis usually happens after birth because the majority of the time the child's hands and feet will be affected, making the condition apparent. Genetic testing can be done to determine whether there are mutations to confirm the disease. There are similar diseases that affect the skin which also have to be taken into consideration before making a diagnosis.\n\nThese are different patterns of disorders that cause the thickening of the skin on the hands and feet:\n\n\n\nTreatment can consist of topical lotions, drug therapies, and surgery. Treatment varies from person to person depending on the severity of their symptoms. Treatment has been more successful with oral retinoids than with the use of topical lotions, applied directly to the affected skin.\n\nAromatic Retinoid Etretinate used to be prescribed and had effective results in treating Meleda disease, but was taken off of the market in 1998 in America due to toxic effects and the increased risk of birth defects. Aromatic Retinoid Etretinate is still sold in Japan under the name \"Tigason\". In America, Etretinate was replaced by Acitretin, and is only used in severe cases due to the severe side effects. If taking Acitretin it is advised to not donate blood or get pregnant for at least 3 years after taking the drug. \n\nTopical lotions can help keep the skin moisturized, and help reduce flaking of the skin. Generally these are safe to put on skin, but possible side effects can include irritation.\n\n\nWith treatment the prognosis can be good for people with this disease. Quality of life can possibly can be decreased, therefore getting treatment is recommended. Too much dry skin can be painful for some and cause discomfort. There is limited data on the life expectancy of an affected person, but this disease alone does not reduce a persons lifespan.\n\nMost cases of Meleda Disease have been reported in and around the former Yugoslavia. It is estimated that there is one case per 100,000 people, who become affected with the disease. Symptoms usually show up after birth and there are no differences in gender or ethnicity as to who can become affected.\n\nThe disease is believed to have started on the Croatian island of Mljet, after people were quarantined on the island for having plague and other diseases in 1826. On the island, inbreeding is believed to have occurred and Meleda disease became apparent.\n\nCurrent research is directed to find more treatments, and to see if there is any way to prevent this disease.\n"}
{"id": "2111998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111998", "title": "Deaf history", "text": "Deaf history\n\nThe history of deaf people and their culture make up deaf history. The Deaf culture is a culture that is centered on sign language and relationships among one another. Unlike other cultures the Deaf culture is not associated with any native land as it is a global culture. By some, deafness may be viewed as a disability, but the Deaf world sees itself as a language minority. Throughout the years many accomplishments have been achieved by deaf people. To name the most famous, Ludwig van Beethoven and Thomas Alva Edison were both deaf and contributed great works to culture.\n\nDeaf people who know Sign Language are proud of their history. In the United States, they recount the story of Laurent Clerc, a Deaf educator, and Thomas H. Gallaudet, an American educator, coming to the United States from France in 1816 to help found the first permanent school for deaf children in the country. In the late 1850s there was a debate about whether or not to create a separate deaf state in the west. The idea was based on the event when the American Congress, at that time, gave part of Alabama to the American Asylum. This deaf state would be a place where all deaf people could migrate, if chosen to, and prosper, however, this plan failed and the whole debate died.\n\nAnother well-known event is the 1880 Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf in Milan, Italy, where hearing educators voted to embrace oral education and remove sign language from the classroom. This effort resulted in strong opposition within Deaf cultures today to the oralist method of teaching deaf children to speak and lip read with limited or no use of sign language in the classroom. The method is intended to make it easier for deaf children to integrate into hearing communities, but there have been many arguments about whether the manual method (where the teachers teach Sign Language as the main way to communicate) or the Oral method (where the teachers make the student learn to speak) are better. Most people now agree that the Manual Method is the preferred method of Deaf communication. The use of sign language is central to the Deaf peoples as a cultural identity and attempts to limit its use are viewed as an attack.\n\nSign language is the most important instrument for communication between deaf people and the Deaf culture. Using sign language deaf people can join social networks, local and globally, which join the Deaf culture together. Sign Language is a loose term for people that are deaf or hard of hearing and use signs to communicate. American Sign Language (ASL) is most closely related to the older form of French Sign Language, as Laurent Clerc, who was deaf and a teacher, was brought to the America's by Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Though Clerc brought French Sign Language, there was already sign language being used. Martha's Vineyard had more than average deaf people who had created their own Sign Language. The French Sign Language and the Sign Language that was already in use, became American Sign Language. Deaf and Hard of Hearing communities are closely drawn together due to their culture and use of Sign Language. Sign language, like the English language, is always changing. If you learn Sign Language on the West coast of the United States and then travel to the East Coast, you will find a different dialect of ASL; although very similar, there are differences. In the United States you will find many dialects of Sign Language - from SEE sign (Signed Exact English), which follows English grammar rules when using modified ASL signs, to the Rochester Method, where every single word is finger spelled out in the English Language, generally without the use of signs. There is a grey area in between 'English' and 'ASL' known as Contact Variety (previously referred to as Pidgin Sign Language, or PSE), which uses any number of combinations of English word order/grammar combined with aspects of ASL (or SEE). You then have people that are not originally from the United States that move here and once they acclimate to ASL, what they sign becomes a mixture of ASL, SEE and their native countries' Sign Language, creating yet another dialect of Sign Language.\n\nAnother powerful bonding forced in the Deaf culture is athletics. Athletics open up a path to achievement where many others are shut out by prejudice due to the level playing field of certain sports. Athletics also create many networking opportunities for Deaf people across the United States to expand their social circles, due to the increased mobility that results from out-of-state competitions, because the deaf population is considerably small at the local scale. Deaf people participate in athletic activities to cultivate their cultural identity as Deaf people. In athletics, they can find solidarity where they are able to comfortably communicate with one another without barriers, embrace values and social norms natural for them and distinct from those in the hearing community, and allow for Deaf people to participate as coaches, athletes, and participants. The American Athletic Association of the Deaf (AAAD) is huge help for deaf people by representing Deaf clubs and organizations throughout the entire American states. The impact of sports in the deaf community can also be seen on the international level. The Deaflympics, sanctioned by the International Olympic Committee, are an elite international sporting event where deaf athletes from across the world compete against each other quadrennially.\n\nThe first ever political movement in Deaf history happened in 1880 in Milan, Italy and was called the Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf, although it was actually the very first International Congress on Education of the Deaf. This first international conference consisted of Deaf educators and is commonly known as \"The Milan Conference\". The conference held deliberations from September 6, 1880, to September 11, 1880, and declared that oral education was superior to manual education and decided to ban the use of sign language in school. There was not one single Deaf educator invited to the conference. Following the conference, schools in Europe and the United States switched to using speech therapy without sign language as a method of education for the Deaf.\n\nThe National Association of the Deaf (NAD) has 22,000 direct members and is a vigorous advocate for sign language and the rights of Deaf people. The NAD helped conduct the first census of the Deaf population. It supports a legal defense fund, sponsors annual camps, and helps fight for the rights of the Deaf community.\n\nSource:\nSource:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2112007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112007", "title": "Gawai Dayak", "text": "Gawai Dayak\n\nGawai Dayak is an annual festival celebrated by the Dayak people in Sarawak, Malaysia and West Kalimantan, Indonesia on 1 and 2 June. It is a public holiday in Sarawak and is both a religious and a social occasion recognised since 1957.\n\nGawai Dayak was the concept of the radio producers Tan Kingsley and Owen Liang taken up by the Dayak community. The British colonial government refused to recognise Dayak Day until 1962. They called it \"Sarawak Day\" for the inclusion of all Sarawakians as a national day, regardless of ethnic origin. \n\nOn 1 June 1963, Datuk Michael Buma, a Betong native, hosted the celebrations of the first Gawai Dayak at his home at Siol Kandis, Kuching. On 25 September 1964, \"Sarawak Day\" was gazetted as a public holiday acknowledging the formation of the Federation of Malaysia. The holiday was first celebrated on 1 June 1965 and it became a symbol of unity, aspiration and hope for the Dayak community. It is an integral part of Dayak social life. It is a thanksgiving day marking a bountiful harvest and a time to plan for the new farming season or other endeavours ahead.\n\n\"Gawai Dayak\" comes from \"Gawai\" meaning \"festival\" and \"Dayak\" a collective name for the indigenous peoples of Sarawak, Indonesian Kalimantan and the interior of Borneo. The population estimate is two to four million people. The Dayaks, previously known as the \"Sea Dayak\" are mostly Iban people. Other ethnic groups such as the Bidayuh people (Land Dayak) and Orang Ulu are recognised. The Orang Ulu include the Kayans, Kenyahs and Lun Bawangs. There are over 200 riverine and hill-dwelling ethnic subgroups in the region. Although these peoples have common traits, each have their own dialect, customs, laws, territory and culture. Dayak languages are categorised as part of the Austronesian languages. The Dayaks embraced animism and paganism but in recent times, many have converted to Christianity.\n\nAs the festival day approaches, everyone will be busy with general tidying up, grave visiting, paddy drying and milling, collecting and preparing food and final house decoration, where necessary. The mode of celebrations of Gawai Dayak vary from place to place and preparations begin early. \n\nWhen a longhouse agrees to host Gawai Dayak with big ritual festivals, they may need to plant extra paddy and organise labour exchange (\"bedurok\"). Rice may be purchased from the towns if the festival is in a place where paddy farming is absent or insufficient . The traditional Dayak liquor is Rice wine called \"tuak\". It is brewed at least one month before the Gawai Dayak. The drink is brewed from the glutinous rice from a recent harvest mixed with home-made yeast called ciping. Traditionally, tuak was made with rice milk only but is now cut with sugar and water in a process called \"mandok\". A stronger alcoholic beverage made by the Ibans is \"langkau\" (called \"arak tonok\" (\"burnt spirit\") by the bidayuhs). This drink is made by distilling tuak over a fire. \n\nTraditional cake delicacies are prepared from glutinous rice flour mixed with sugar. The cakes include \"sarang semut\" (ant nest cake), \"cuwan\" (molded cake) and \"kuih sepit\" (twisted cake). The cakes can last well whilst kept inside a jar because they are deep-fried until hardened. \"Penganan iri\" (a discus-shaped cake) are made just prior to the festival day because they do not keep well. This is because the cake is lifted from the hot frying oil while not fully hardened. The sugar used can be the brown nipah sugar or cane sugar.\n\nBefore the Gawai eve, the longhouse residents may organise a hunting or fishing trip to gather wild meats and fish. Both can be preserved with salt in a jar or smoked over a firewood platform above the hearth. Any wild animal parts like the horns, teeth and claws, and feathers are used to decorate and repair traditional costumes.\n\nThe longhouse is cleaned, repaired and repainted by co-operation amongst its residents. The longhouse is constructed as a unique place of living and worship. Its main post (\"tiang pemun\") is the designated starting point of all the building materials (\"pun ramu\") and must remain intact. Timber and wooden materials for repairs are obtained from nearby reserve forests (\"pulau galau, pulau ban\") or purchased in towns. A \"pantar\" (long chair) may be built along the upper area of the \"ruai\" (gallery). The seat is raised and the \"tanju\" (verandah wall) is used as the back rest. Some old wooden longhouses (\"rumah kayu\") are renovated with concrete and bricks to make a terraced structure (\"rumah batu\").\n\nThe inside walls of the longhouse are decorated with \"ukir\" murals portraying tree and wild animal motifs. Men with decorating skills make split bamboo designs. Women decorate living room walls by hanging their handwoven ceremonial clothes called pua kumbu and other handycrafts. Orang Ulu are famous for their colourful paintings of the tree of life on their house walls and their house posts are elaborately carved. Highly decorated shields are displayed near the family room door. Heirloom jars, brassware and old human skulls obtained during raids or trade sojourns, if still kept, are cleaned and displayed. Deer horns may be secured on the longhouse posts in order to secure highly decorated swords and other household items.\n\nOn Gawai Eve, people gather sago, aping, sawit or coconut palm shoots which are used for making soup mixed with meats. Vegetables such as wild miding fern, fiddlehead fern, bamboo shoots, tapioca leaves and Dayak round brinjals from nearby jungle, farms or gardens are also gathered. \n\nAfter the gathering of plants and vegetables early in the morning, the poultry is slaughtered. Enough meat is cooked in mid-aged thin-walled bamboo logs to make a traditional dish called \"pansoh\" (or \"lulun\" in the Iban language). The meat is first mixed with traditional herbs like lemon grass, ginger, bungkang leaves and salt. Any remaining meat is preserved in salt and mixed with kepayang leaves and detoxined seeds. Animal heads are roasted over an open fire to be served hot with tuak. Wooden cooking implements are made from small tree logs.\n\nSome glutinous rice is cooked in bamboo logs to soak up the bamboo aroma. Normal rice will be cooked in pots at the kitchen hearth. The addition of pandan leaves gives a special aroma. Smoke from the fire wood also gives a distinctive aroma. Some Dayaks, especially Orang Ulu, will wrap rice in long green leaves (daun long) before steaming it inside a pot. Rice may also be cooked using a gas stove or rice cooker. \n\nHighly decorated mats with motives for guests to sit on are laid out on the longhouse gallery which runs the entire length of the long house building. The act is called \"beranchau\" (mat spreading and adjoining) which marks the opening of the gawai. The Dayaks make various types of traditional hand-woven mats. There are reed mats woven with colourful designs, \"lampit\" rattan mats, \"bidai\" tree bark mats and \"peradani\" mats. The walls of most family rooms and galleries are decorated with traditional blankets such as the woven \"Pua Kumbu\" and the tied cloth (\"kain kebat\") blankets which are made with unique Dayak designs. During the festival, women are keen to display the products of their skills and hard work at mat-making and hand-weaving. Some traditional baskets are also seen. Some sets of traditional musical instruments are also shown in the gallery.\n\nMen and women may wear \"nigepan\", the traditional costume, especially when guests are arriving. The traditional dress of men is a loincloth (sirat or cawat), animal skin coat (gagong), peacock and hornbill feathers (lelanjang) headware, chains over the neck (marik), silver armlets and anklelets along with a shield, sword and spear. Men are decorated with tribal tattoos (kalingai or pantang in Iban) which signify their life experience and journey. A frog design on the front of the man's neck and or tegulun designs on the backs of the hand indicate the wearer has chopped off a human head or killed a man in military combat. However, some designs are based on marine life which are meant for protection and rescue of the wearers when on the water. \n\nWomen wear a hand-woven cloth (\"kain betating\") worn around the waist, a rattan and brass ring high corset around the upper body, \"selampai\" (a long piece of scalp) worn over the shoulders, a woven bead chain over the neck and shoulders (\"marik empang\"), a decorated high-comb (\"sugu tinggi\") over the hair lump (\"sanggul\"), a silver belt (\"lampit\"), armlet, anklet and orb fruit purse. In the past, it was customary for Dayak women to have the breasts bare as a sign of beauty. In Bidayuh Dayaks society, Dayung Boris are the maidens of the Gawai Festival.\n\nCelebrations begin on the evening of 31 May with a ceremony to cast away the spirit of greed (\"Muai Antu Rua\"). Two children or men, each dragging a winnowing basket (\"chapan\") will pass each by family's room. Every family will throw some unwanted article into the basket. The unwanted articles will then be tossed to the ground from the end of the longhouse. \n\nAt dusk, a ritual offering ceremony (\"miring\" or \"bedara\") will take place at every family room, one after the other. Before the ceremony, ritual music called \"gendang rayah\" is performed. Old ceramic plates, \"tabak\" (big brass chalices) or containers made of split bamboo skins (\"kelingkang\") are filled with food and drinks to be offered to the deities. \n\nThe Iban Dayaks believe in seven deities (the people of hornbill's nest ie Orang Tansang Kenyalang) whose names are \"Sengalang Burong\" (the god of war which is represented by the brahminy kite in this world); \"Biku Bunsu Petara\" (the great priest who is second in command), \"Menjaya Manang\" (the first shaman and god of medicine), \"Sempulang Gana with Semerugah\" (the god of agriculture and land), \"Selampandai\" (the god of creation and procreativity), \"Ini Inee/Andan\" (the god of justice) and \"Anda Mara\" (the god of fortune). Iban Dayaks also call upon the legendary and mythical people of Panggau Libau and Gelong, and some good helpful spirits or ghosts to attend the feast. The entire pantheon of gods is cordially invited to the gawai feast.\n\nOfferings to the deities are placed at strategic spots ie the four corners of each family room for protection of souls, in the kitchen, at the rice jar, in the gallery, the tanju and the farm. Other highly prized possessions such as precious old jars and modern items like rice milling engines, boat engines or a car may also be placed with offerings. Any \"pengaroh\" (charm) will be brought out for this ceremony to ensure its continuous effectiveness and to avoid madness afflicting the owner. Wallets are placed among the offerings to increase the \"tuah\" or fortune of the owners.\n\nEach set of offerings usually contains specified odd numbers (ie 1, 3, 5, 7) of traditional items: the cigarette nipah leaves and tobacco, betel nut and sireh leaves, glutinous rice in a hand-woven leave container (\"senupat\"), rice cakes (\"tumpi\"), \"sungki\" (glutinous rice cooked in buwan leaves), glutinuos rice cooked in bamboo logs (\"asi pulut lulun\"), \"penganan iri\" (cakes of glutinous rice flour mixed with \"nipah\" sugar), ant nest cakes and moulded cakes, poprice (made from glutinous paddy grains heated in a wok or pot), hard-boiled chicken eggs and \"tuak\" rice wine poured over or contained in a small bamboo cup.\n\nAfter all the offering sets are completed, the chief of the festival thanks the gods for a good harvest, and asks for guidance, blessings and long life as he waves a cockerel over the offerings (\"bebiau\"). The cockerel is sacrificed by slicing its neck. Its wing feathers are pulled out and brushed onto its bleeding neck after which each feather is placed as a sacrifice (\"genselan\") onto each of the offering sets. The offerings are then placed at the designated locations..\n\nOnce the offering ceremony is completed, the family sits down for dinner, the \"makai di ruai\" (meal at gallery) or makai rami\" (festival meal) in the gallery of the longhouse. Each family member has contributed something. All the best traditional foods, delicacies and drinks that have been prepared are displayed. \n\nJust before midnight, a spirit-welcoming procession (\"Ngalu Petara\") is performed several times up and down the gallery. A beauty pageant to choose the festival's queen and king (Kumang and Keling Gawai) is sometimes conducted. The winners are chosen for completeness of their traditional costumes and beauty. The chief and elders hold a \"begeliga\" to remind everybody to keep order, peace and harmony. Heavy fines (\"ukom\") are imposed on those who break the customary \"adat\" and festive ground rules with fighting, quarrelling, drunkenness or vandalism. \n\nAt midnight, a gong is rung to call the inhabitants to attention. The longhouse chief (\"tuai rumah\") or host will lead a toast to longevity (\"Ai Pengayu\") and the new year with a short prayer (\"sampi\"). The festival greeting, \"Gayu Guru, Gerai Nyamai, Senang Lantang Nguan Menua\" (Wishing you longevity, wellness and prosperity) is repeated to each other. Mistakes and quarrels are forgiven. Where a bard is available, he may be asked to recite a short chant called \"timang ai pengayu\" (chanting the water of longevity) to bless the longevity water before the chief says the short prayer.\n\nAfter dinner, celebrations are less formal. A tree of life (\"ranyai\") is erected in the centre of the gallery to symbolize the ritual shrine with valuable fruits. Around it, performances of the \"ngajat\" dance, sword dance (\"bepencha\") or self-defence martial art (\"bekuntau\") are performed after some symbolic traditional activities. The first order among the activities after dinner is the \"badigir\", a lining up of elders and/or guests if any according to their social rank. A \"tabak\" (chalice) of food and drinks is offered to each elder in the line up by a few women of high social rank in the longhouse, normally a wife offering to her husband. A group of women in costumes led by an expert sings a honouring pantun (praise song) befitting the status of each elder while offering a bowl (\"jalong\") of tuak and some \"tabas\" (delicacies) to several key elders with some outstanding life achievement. \n\nThe chief among them will then be requested to symbolically split open a coconut which symbolize the head skull trophy which is traditionally much-treasured by the Iban Dayak because the head skull is believed to present various types of valuable seeds for men, be they for farming or procreation purposes. In more elaborate events, the chief warrior will perform the symbolic act of clearing the pathway (\"ngerandang jalai\"). He is then followed by his warriors in performing the symbolic act of handrailing the pathway (\"ngelalau jalai\"). \n\nNext, follows a procession by men and women, ladies, youths and kids in traditional costumes along the gallery in honour of the elders in the line up, normally three rounds depending on the length of the longhouse. One outcome of this procession is the anointing of a kumang (princess) and a keeling (prince). After this, some of the procession participants may go for the tuak contained in several medium-sized jar (\"kebok\" or \"pasu\") after paying a token of their appreciation to the respective owners who are normally expert brewers. This tuak is normally the pure liquid from the glutinous rice which tastes sweet but it contains a high concentration of alcohol. Tuak is normally drank after food, just like the grape wine. Some foods and drinks have been served for all presents. Rice cakes are eaten as deserts. \n\nAnother important activity is the singing of traditional poems. These include pantun, ramban, jawang, sanggai and pelandai. Any honoured guests to longhouses may be asked to break up a coconut to symbolise the actions of Sengalang Burong (the god of war) during the Iban timang incantation which is called \"ngelanpang\" (cleansing the head skull to present various kinds of beneficial seeds to humankind). In the actual cleansing of the freshly taken heads, the troop leader would eat a bit of the brain with a piece of a glutinous rice before proceeding to throw away the brain using a rattan swirled by him inside the skull and to slice out the flesh using his war sword. This coconut splitting ceremony is a sign of respect and honour to the guests being offered to do so. \n\nOther merry-making activities which may extend to the next day include (blowpipe) (sumpit) contests and traditional games such as arm-wrestling (bibat lengan), small log pulling (betarit lampong), rope pulling (tarit tali) and foot-banging (bapatis). Some engage in cockfighting. in modern settings, mini sports include football, \"sepak takraw\" (rattan kickball) and futsal. Other games are egg-rolling, plate passing according to the taboh music, running in gunny sacks and balloon blowing and karaoke and joget dance.\n\nThere are many variations of the traditional \"ngajat\" or \"ajat\" dance. The male and female dances consist of graceful, precise and surprise movements of the body, hands and feet with occasional shouts of a battle cry. Examples are the freestyle ajat male dance, warrior dance,\"ngajat lesong\" (rice mortar dance), \"ngasu\" hunting dance or comical \"muar kesa\" (ant harvesting) dance for men. Women perform the freestyle female ajat dance or the \"ngajat pua kumbu\" (ritual cloth waving dance). The male dance shows strength and bravery and may imitate the movements of a hornbill which is regarded as the king of worldly birds. The ngajat dance is accompanied by a traditional band consisting of an \"engkerumong\" set (percussion), \"tawak\" (big gong), \"bebendai\" (small gong) and \"bedup\" (drum). The Orang Ulu music is played using the \"sape\". Recordings of the tunes may be used instead of a band nowadays.\n\nBidayuh Dayak dances include the \"tolak bala\" (danger repealing), a dance performed before the harvest to ask for blessing and protection of the community; the \"totokng\" dance that is performed during the harvest festival to welcome the paddy soul and guests; the \"langi julang\" which is performed at the closing of the harvest festival to thank gods for bestowing good health and a rich harvest; and the eagle-warrior fight dance performed after the harvest season. Hands are held outstretched imitating the movements of the eagles as they flap their wings in flight. The eagle eventually falls unconscious so leaving the warrior as the winner. It is performed by men seeking a female partner.\n\nOn the first day of June, Dayak homes are opened to guests. This practice is called \"ngabang\". Open houses may also be organised by Dayak associations or non-government organisations. This will continue until the end of June where the gawai will be closed in a \"ngiling bidai\" (mat rolling up) ceremony. \n\nWhen guests arrive, tuak is offered and women line up in two rows on each side of the ladder \"nyambut pengabang\". The welcoming drink (\"ai tiki\") is followed by the thirst-quenching drink (\"ai aus\"). Then, when the guests are seated, further rounds of tuak as a washing drink (\"ai basu\"), profit drink (\"ai untong\") and respect drink (\"ai basa\") are given. This activity is called the watering of guests or \"nyibur temuai\". \n\nSpeeches are made such as the \"jaku ansah\" (sharpening speech) which introduces the guest of honor. The guest of honor is received with a \"miring\" offering ceremony outside the longhouse. Upon approaching the longhouse ladder, the guest of honor is asked to \"open a fort\" (\"muka kuta\"). This is represented by the slashing of a bamboo fence with a sword and a poem. Then, at the foot of the longhouse ladder, an animal is speared (\"mankan\"). \n\nIn \"ngalu pengabang\", guests led by \"ngajat\" dancers and followed by the band, process to their seats in the longhouse gallery. After that, a guest prayer (\"biau pengabang\") is recited by a talented speaker like the headman or the \"lemambang\" bard while he sways holding a chicken over the heads of guests. Before the guests are offered foods, a special speech (called \"muka kujuk\" in Iban) to open the traditional cloth covering over food containers is recited. \n\nAfter eating, the families of the longhouse are visited by guests. A short longhouse may have ten to thirty family rooms while moderately long may have thirty to fifty family rooms. A very long longhouse may have fifty to one hundred family rooms. It is common for Dayaks to recite and discuss their genealogy (\"tusut in Iban\") to reinforce kinships. In the activity called \"bantil\" (persuaded drinking), women offer drinks to men to help them overcome shyness. Men traditionally reject the first offers as a sign of respect to the host. Women sing a traditional poem called \"pantun\" while offering tuak. In the activity called \"uti\", a special guest is asked to open a coconut placed on a ceramic plate using a blunt knife without handling the coconut or breaking the plate. The coconut offered to be split open by ordinary guests tells of someone's heart and fate: white flesh is good and black flesh is bad.\n\nIn town areas, pre-gawai are held in May in advance of the gawai proper before the city dwellers return to their respective villages. \n\nGawai ends around the end of June. The closing ceremony is signified by symbolically rolling back a miring ceremony mat called a \"bidai\" by each family within the longhouse. It is known as \"Ngiling Bidai\" among Iban Dayaks.\n\nGawai Dayak celebrations may last for a month. It is during this time of year that many Dayak hold authentic ritual festivals and weddings (\"Melah Pinang\" or \"Gawai Lelabi\") take place. \n\nMost Iban will hold minor rites called \"bedara\" which can be \"bedara mata\" (an unripe offering) inside the family \"bilek\" room or \"bedara mansau\" (a ripe offering) at the family ruai gallery. \"Berunsur\" (cleansing) is performed at the family \"tanju\" (verandah). Rituals called \"gawa\" are the \"Sandau Ari\" (midday festival); \"Tresang Mansau\" (red bamboo pole); and \"Gawai Kalingkang\". \n\nRitual feasts of the Saribas and Skrang region include \"Gawai Bumai\" (agricultural festival) which comprises \"Gawai Batu\" (whetstone festival), \"Gawai Benih]]\" (a paddy seed festival) and gawai basimpan (paddy storing festival); and \"Gawai Burong\" (a bird festival). The bird festival is performed earlier in the festive period to avoid spoiling of rice wine by the spirit \"Indai Bilai\" if the entombment festival for the dead (\"Gawai Antu\" or \"Ngelumbong\") is also held within the same longhouse.\n\nIn the Baleh region, the Iban ritual festivals include the \"Gawai Baintu-intu\" (wellness festival); \"Gawai Bumai\" (farming festival); \"Gawai Amat\" (proper festival to request divine supernatural assistance); \"Gawai Ngelumbung\" (tomb building festival) and \"Gawai Mimpi\" (dream festival based on dream messages from the spirits). \n\nFortune related festivals include a \"Gawai Mangkong Tiang\" (main house post hammering festival) for any newly completed longhouses.; \"Gawai Tuah\" (fortune festival) which comprises three stages i.e. \"Gawai Ngiga Tuah\" (fortune seeking festival), \"Gawai Namaka Tuah\" (fortune welcoming festival) and \"gawai nindokka tuah\" (fortune safekeeping festival) and \"Gawai Tajau\" (jar festival);. The health-related festivals which may be performed are the \"Gawai Sakit\" (healing festival) which takes place if the \"belian\" rituals, \"sugi sakit\" (supernatural cleansing) or \"renong sakit\" (supernatural curing) are unsuccessful. \n\nFor most of these traditional festivals, sacred invocation and incantations called \"pengap\" or \"timang\" are performed throughout the night(s) by a bard (\"lemambang\") and his assistants or a \"manang\" (healer). \n\nChristian Dayaks replace the traditional offering ceremony with a prayer session within the family room. The associated church service leader is called \"tuai sembiang\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2112008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112008", "title": "Isobel (song)", "text": "Isobel (song)\n\n\"Isobel\" is a song recorded by Icelandic singer Björk for her second studio album, \"Post\". Written by Sjón based on a story by Björk, the lyrics of \"Isobel\" tell the story of the title character, who is magically born in a forest and sends a message of instinct amongst the logic thinking of the people of the city. The story of Isobel has been explored in \"Human Behaviour\" and \"Bachelorette\", forming a trilogy. The track was released as the second single for the album as two different CD releases in August 1995. Featuring additional songwriting by Nellee Hooper and Marius de Vries, string arrangements by Eumir Deodato and production by Hooper and Björk, \"Isobel\" combines a lush orchestral sound with electronic breakbeats.\n\nMost commentators were enticed by \"Isobel\", which they declared one of the highlights of the \"Post\" album. The single peaked at number eighteen on the Finnish Singles Chart, twenty-three on the UK Singles Charts and forty-seven on the New Zealand Singles Chart. The song was included in the compilation album \"Greatest Hits\" (2002), whose tracks were selected by fans through a survey.\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Isobel\" was directed by frequent collaborator Michel Gondry and represents the story the lyrics convey. The surreal video resembles an early film and garnered acclaim from critics, although it received no support from MTV. Björk has performed \"Isobel\" on various television shows and in six of her tours, the most recent being the Utopia Tour.\n\n\"Isobel\" originated amongst the most complicated in the tracks contained in \"Post\" and perhaps in all of Björk's work. The song's lyrics were written in collaboration with Icelandic poet Sjón, his very first songlyric. Together with Þór Eldon, Björk's ex-husband and member of The Sugarcubes, Sjón and the singer had been part of a circle of anarchist poets in Reykjavik called \"Medusa\" and had met while she was a member of KUKL. Sjón would become a frequent collaborator throughout Björk's career.\n\nBjörk came up with the melody for \"Isobel\" during a Christmas visit to her native Iceland. She worked on a portable Casio keyboard and brought it to Nellee Hooper —British producer who had produced her previous studio album, \"Debut\" (1993)— who added a snare and sound effects to Brazilian musician Eumir Deodato's string arrangements. Deodato explained his work: \"In some of the songs I followed her secondary vocal lines; there was very little harmony and very few chords. I was doing that on 'Isobel' too, where I wrote a natural C in a line that was in B minor. Much later on I learned that Björk is the type of singer who will sing the A sharp in A minor, but I wasn't yet aware that she did that when I did that first song.\"\n\nThe lyrics were the final addition to the song. The original idea for the lyrics dates back to late 1994, when a moth stayed on the collar of Björk's shirt until the evening. Interpreting the incident as a kind of omen, she tried to create a story and a character about it, writing 900 pages of a diary. She recalls: \"I'd been fighting like a lunatic, and going completely bonkers. I knew that if I waited for three months, threw away the book, preferably burning it, then I'd wake up one morning with the lyric. But I badly wanted this song on the album. I didn’t know what to do.\" Thus she decided to contact Sjón, explaining the story of the title character to him.\n\nThe song forms a trilogy with \"Human Behaviour\" of \"Debut\" (1993) and \"Bachelorette\" of \"Homogenic\" (1997). Björk explained: \"In 'Human Behaviour', she's a little girl. In 'Isobel', she moves to the big city and big lights. [...] In 'Bachelorette' she takes over and trees grow over the city\". Their respective music videos, directed by Michel Gondry, represent this story. In a 2008 interview with Stereogum, she also included \"Oceania\" of \"Medúlla\" (2004) and \"Wanderlust\" of \"Volta\" (2007) in this narrative cycle.\n\"Isobel\" is a string-laden, orchestral trip hop song written by Björk, Nellee Hooper, Marius de Vries and Sjón. According to pianist Steve Boudreau, the main chord progression is a variant of the Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart staple \"My Funny Valentine\", with both songs relying on a minor chord with all the harmonic motion in the upper voice. In \"My Funny Valentine\" it descends chromatically from the root, while in \"Isobel\" it forms more of a circle. Various critics have discussed the song's distinctive pace, with \"Pulse!\"'s Tom Lanham describing it as \"lazy [and] unassuming\", like \"a camel making its way across the desert\", and \"Rolling Stone\"s Lorraine Ali writing the song \"snakes along like a patient desert caravan\". Maurice Murphy's trumpet opens the piece, followed by Deodato's lush string arrangements and Hooper's sound effects which Björk has described as \"jungle-istic\". Craig McLean of \"The Face\" called the track \"Broadway on breakbeats.\"\n\nThe lyrics of \"Isobel\" were noted as having a \"visually rich narrative\" by website Stereogum, and have been described as a fairy tale, a children's story, a fable, and a lullaby. Björk has described the story in many interviews, like in 1995 with \"Eurotrash\":\n\nThis is the story of Isobel; she was born in a forest by a spark, and as she grew up, she realized that the pebbles on the forest floor were actually skyscrapers. And by the time she was a grown-up woman and the skyscrapers had taken over the forest, she found herself in a city, and she didn't like all the people there so much, because they were a bit too clever for her.\n\nShe decided to send to the world, all these moths that she had trained to go and fly all over the world and go inside windows of people's houses— the ones that were too clever— and they'd sit on their shoulder and remind them to stop being clever and start to function by their instincts. They do that by saying \"Nah-nah-nan-nah-nah!\" to them... \"(Björk waves a finger in front of her face)\"... and then they'd say \"Oh! Sorry! I was being all clever there!\", and start functioning on instinct.\n\nIn the city, Isobel \"dances naked on tables and falls in love with all the wrong people and causes pain\", so she decides to live in isolation once again. Throughout the track, Björk shifts from a third person narration to a first person narration, placing herself as both the narrator and the protagonist. This duality is represented in the single's artwork —which features Björk kissing herself— and the song's music video. The singer has indeed described the lyrics as \"part autobiography part storytelling\". In the first verse, Björk describes Isobel's birth: \"In a forest pitch-dark / Glowed the tiniest spark / It burst into a flame / Like me\". When singing \"My name Isobel / Married to myself / My love Isobel / Living by herself\" the singer describes Isobel's isolation and also \"to have that relationship with [herself] and be self-sufficient and surprise [herself].\"\n\nBjörk has said the character's name is Isobel instead of Isabel as a reference to \"isolation\". The character also gets its name from Isobel Griffith, an arranger that was collaborating on the album. She envisioned the tale inspired by epic stories like those of Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez —wanting to create \"a very South American sort of drama\"—, and 19th century literature. Björk has also described the character as mythological, saying she represents intuition in the way Atlas stands for strength and Neptune is the god of the ocean. In an interview with \"Politiken\", she also agreed that the song describes \"the duality between reason and emotions, between intuition and intellect\". Being a fan of Brazilian music, Björk affirmed she wrote the song whilst listening to Brazilian singer Elis Regina, to whom she later dedicated the song.\n\nAlthough the record company was against the idea of releasing \"Isobel\" as the album's second single after \"Army of Me\", Björk insisted because she \"felt intuitively that this was the right choice\". \"Isobel\" came out as a single in August 1995 as two different CD releases. Both singles' cover art were designed by Me Company and contain a poster photographed by Jürgen Teller; CD1's cover artwork was photographed by Andrea Giacobbe, and shows Björk kissing another Björk. \"Isobel\" was also included in the 1996 remix album \"Telegram\" (in its Deodato Mix version), and the 2002 \"best of\" album \"Greatest Hits\", whose tracklist was determined by fans through an online survey.\n\nCD1 featured the B-side \"Charlene\", a mid-tempo song with sexually suggestive and ambiguous lyrics inspired by friend Kadamba Simmons. It also included the techno track \"I Go Humble\", which LFO released without the vocals under the title \"Shove Piggy Shove\" in the 1996 album \"Advance\", and a slowed-down version of \"Venus as a Boy\" with Guy Sigsworth playing the harpsichord. CD2's B-sides are three remixes of \"Isobel\": one by Eumir Deodato featuring \"Brazilian sensibilities\", a \"vaguely ambient\" one by Sigtryggur Baldursson of The Sugarcubes, and a jungle one by Goldie.\n\n\"Isobel\" garnered acclaim from music critics. BBC's Mike Diver called it a \"brilliant [single]\", and his personal favourite. Heather Phares of AllMusic highlighted the song's production and arrangement, writing that especially in this track \"Post\" \"[aims] for, and [accomplishes] more\" than simply a \"Debut\" redux. Considering it as one of the \"most compelling moments\", the \"Billboard\" review for \"Post\" described the track as \"delightfully airy\". \"The New Rolling Stone Album Guide\" commented that \"Isobel\" features a \"more assured [melody] for Björk's voice to circle like Christmas lights,\" and referred to it as \"a light-headed ode to self-adoration.\" Michael Snyder of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" wrote, \"She's a feral jungle girl on \"Isobel\" with its cool Brazilian rhythms and wide-screen strings.\" Music journalist Mark Pytlik considered the UK CD1 release of \"Isobel\" to be \"the finest of the \"Post\"-era singles, and certainly a nice refuge from the deluge of remixes that were to follow.\" \"Isobel\" was included in the list of Singles of the Year of \"The Face\" at number 12 and \"Spex\" at number 24. It was also listed at number 28 in \"Panorama\"s The 30 Best Singles of the Year 1970-98 in 1999, and was nominated for the Icelandic Music Award for Song of the Year, losing to her own \"Army of Me\". \"Isobel\" peaked at number 18 on the Finnish Singles Chart, 23 on the UK Singles Chart, and 47 on the New Zealand Singles Chart.\n\nThe music video for \"Isobel\" was directed by Michel Gondry, who had directed the avant-garde videos for \"Human Behaviour\" and \"Army of Me\". It was filmed for two days in a forest in Dolgellau, near Llangollen, Wales. A \"long day\" of shooting also took place in Black Island Studios in London on 31 May 1995. The crew used a Mitchell S35 camera with varispeed to be able to rewind the camera and do superimpositions and masks, inspired by Georges Méliès' work. \"Model Solutions\", an English model maker crew, built the harmonium used in the video, and the art department led by Joseph Bennett brought the model planes, insects and lightbulbs. The filming process was not easy, as the day was rainy, no one was quite sure of what they were doing and Björk did not like her outfit (she wears two different outfits in the video for this reason). To get projections to appear inside the water organ of the video, the crew used a mirror trick and filmed it in London, as the screen for rear projections was big and needed much distance. The final music video was projected in 35mm for the crew in a cinema in London; with its varying exposures, lighting effects and monochromatic schema, it resembles an early film.\n\nThe music video for \"Isobel\" represents the story of the title character Björk envisioned with Sjón. It tells the story of \"a wild child discovering urban culture through installations of toy fighter planes\", over lush superimposed imagery. Like in the lyrics, where Björk takes the role of narrator and protagonist, she plays two different parts in the music video: Björk is seen as the Isobel who \"weaves and composes this world and this story on her organ\", and as the Isobel who inhabits this primal world. Water is the primary feature of her world, Gondry using it as a dreamy transition tool between scenes.\n\nIsobel plays a piano that is full of pipes that fill it with water. Children play in the water, and wear masks. Isobel is later shown lying beside a river wearing a dress with lights in it. She pulls some light bulbs off her dress and plants them in the ground. The light bulbs grow and act as incubators or cocoons for toy airplanes inside them. When the airplanes grow big enough, they break out of the bulbs and fly away. At the same time, numerous skyscrapers grow out of the ground and eventually are covered in cockroaches. Isobel is also shown walking through the countryside, up a mountain, and beside a river.\n\nThe video received general acclaim from critics. The video, however, received little support from MTV, as airings for both \"Isobel\" and \"Army of Me\" had been relegated primarily to the show \"120 Minutes\". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine included the video in his list of the Top 10 Björk Music Videos, describing it as \"surreal [and] visually striking\". Ed Gonzalez of the same publication described it as \"Jean Epstein-ian kabuki horror.\"\n\nBjörk performed \"Isobel\" on BBC One's \"Top of the Pops\" on two occasions in August 1995; the first was on 17 August, live from New York City, and the second one was on 24 August. The song was also performed on Björk's set on \"MTV Live\" show in February 1998. It was also performed on all of Björk's tours since its release, excluding the Volta Tour. Performances of the song were added to video releases \"Live at Shepherds Bush Empire\" (1998), \"Live in Cambridge\" (2001), \"Live at Royal Opera House\" (2002), and \"\" (2014).\n\nCredits adapted from \"Post\"'s liner notes.\n"}

Although a small number of bowloader eights exist, the larger boat's momentum means that a coxswain lying in the bows could be injured in a collision if the bow collapses. A bowloader is slightly faster than a stern-coxed boat, since the mass of the coxswain in the bow reduces porpoising, and the semi-supine position puts the coxswain's center of mass below the waterline, reducing roll. Both of these factors help to reduce drag. The cox also has better forward vision in a bowloader: in the conventional stern position the cox cannot see directly ahead.\n\nNovice coxswains often have difficulty with bowloaders, however, since the rowers and their oars cannot easily be seen. Experienced coxswains learn how to feel the movements of the rowers in the boat, as well as visualising the position of the shell itself to safely and effectively maneuver it.\n\nBowloaders require an amplifier and loudspeakers to be used so that the cox can communicate with the crew, and unlike in the conventional coxing position there is no opportunity for personal communication between cox and stroke on race tactics.\n"}

It was released in 2001, under the managemente of Big Shtick Productions Ltd., but it was not widely commercial. In England, it was released by Australian record company Phantom.\n\nBublé stated that his interest in singing jazz and swing standards stems from his listening to old Mills Brothers recordings, as is evident on albums such as \"BaBalu\", where he actually re-records several Mills Brothers hits, such as \"Lazy River.\" Bublé says, \"Although I like rock 'n' roll and modern music, the first time my granddad played me the Mills Brothers, something magical happened. The lyrics were so romantic, so real, the way a song should be for me. It was like seeing my future flash before me. I wanted to be a singer and I knew that this was the music that I wanted to sing.\" The track \"Spiderman Theme\" was later remixed by Junkie XL, released as a single and also used in the movie \"Spider-Man 2\". \"Spider-Man\" is misspelled on the original album packaging, excluding the hyphen that falls between Spider and Man.\n\nThe title, \"BaBalu\", refers to the Vancouver night club where Bublé regularly performed in the late 1990s before gaining broad recognition outside of his home town. The club has since become Doolin's Irish Pub, located on Granville Street at Nelson. The word Babalu is a reference to Margarita Lecuona's song \"Babalu\" popularized by famous Cuban big band singers Miguelito Valdés and Desi Arnaz. Also seen, as such, with the character of Ricky Ricardo (played by Desi Arnaz) on the classic TV comedy series \"I Love Lucy\". The word originally refers to \"Babalú-ayé\", an orisha or deity in the Santería religion.

{"id": "2112020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112020", "title": "Triple X (professional wrestling)", "text": "Triple X (professional wrestling)\n\nTriple X was a wrestling stable in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. The team consisted of Christopher Daniels, Elix Skipper and Low Ki (later known as Senshi). The team was originally formed in late 2002 as part of Vince Russo's Sports Entertainment Xtreme superstable. Daniels, the leader of this group, was a part of it during all of its runs until November 11, 2007.\n\nTriple X began as a team under Vince Russo's \"Sports Entertainment Xtreme\" faction. They began teaming on December 18, 2002 defeating the team of Amazing Red and The S.A.T.. One of the unique trends begun by Triple X was the \"Triple X Rule\" (which is precedented by the earlier Freebird Rule). When Low Ki and Elix Skipper won the NWA World Tag Team Championship on January 22, 2003, from America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm), TNA officials permitted them to allow Christopher Daniels to defend the title as well. Before each tag team match, all three members of Triple X would stand in the ring, and only when the bell rang would it be known which two of the three would be competing.\n\nThey made the first title defense on February 5 PPV against Disciples of the New Church (Brian Lee and Slash) which ended in a double pin. As a result of this double pin, they were stripped of the titles. On the March 12 PPV, they defeated America's Most Wanted to begin their second NWA World Tag Team Championship reign. They began feuding with both Disciples of the New Church and America's Most Wanted over the titles. However, they lost the titles to Jerry Lynn and The Amazing Red on April 16.\n\nOn May 7, Christopher Daniels became the first ever solo holder of the NWA World Tag Team Championship. He won a handicap match with then-champions Amazing Red and Jerry Lynn by disqualification (at the time in TNA, championships could change hands by countout or DQ). They used their \"Triple X Rule\" to allow Elix Skipper to defend with him. During this time, Triple X began their now-legendary feud against America's Most Wanted, becoming the only team in TNA history to maintain regular success against the most dominant tag team in TNA history. This included the first cage match in TNA history, in which America's Most Wanted finally scored a win against Triple X for the NWA World Tag Team Championship on June 25.\n\nAfter Low Ki left TNA in July 2003, Triple X parted ways the next month and both Daniels and Skipper focused on singles careers. However, they had a short lived reunion in January 2004.\n\nIn March, Daniels brought in Low Ki as a surprise partner for the vacant NWA World Tag Team Championship Tournament, in which they defeated The New Franchise (Michael Shane and Shane Douglas) and The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens) before losing the finals to Kid Kash and Dallas. Afterwards, Low Ki disappeared from TNA again.\n\nOn May 26, 2004, Daniels and Skipper were reunited as members of Team NWA for the World X Cup, which pitted teams from the NWA, Japan, Mexico and Canada against one another in a series of matches for points. With the assistance of Daniels' and Skipper's Triple X teamwork, Team NWA was successful at winning the 2004 World X Cup.\n\nAfter helping Team NWA win the World X Cup, Daniels ended up injuring his shoulder in Japan. After returning a month later, Daniels and Skipper stayed together, this time officially reuniting as Triple X. They went after the NWA Tag Team belts once more, this time in a feud involving long-term enemies America's Most Wanted and The Naturals. In an ironic twist of fate, they would each win the belts separately with members of their sworn enemies, America's Most Wanted. Elix Skipper and Chris Harris won the titles from The Naturals on September 8, but were beaten by Daniels and James Storm on September 21 tapings of \"Impact!\", who held them until losing to Team Canada's Bobby Roode and Eric Young on October 12.\n\nAfter that loss, the feud restarted in earnest, leading to a Last Team Standing match at TNA's first three-hour monthly pay-per-view Victory Road 2004. AMW went on to win the match. The two teams met each other in a Six Sides of Steel match at Turning Point 2004, a rematch of an August 2003 steel cage encounter, where the losing team was forced to disband. In a match that saw Elix Skipper do the now-legendary cagewalk rana, AMW got the win when they handcuffed Daniels to a corner and put the Power-Plex—Triple X's own finisher—on Skipper. Due to the loss, Triple X was disbanded and Daniels and Skipper could not tag together again.\n\nFollowing the split at the end of Turning Point, both Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper pursued singles careers in TNA. Daniels achieved success early on, winning the TNA X Division Championship at Destination X 2005. His first pay per view title defense was against none other than his former partner, Skipper, whom he defeated at Lockdown 2005. Daniels' reign continued through Unbreakable, at which point he lost the belt to A.J. Styles. Daniels later regained the belt in an Ultimate X match at Destination X 2006 against Samoa Joe and Styles, but soon after he lost the belt to Joe. Daniels regained the TNA X Division Championship one more time in a three-way match against Styles and Chris Sabin, before losing it just weeks later to Sabin at Final Resolution 2007 in another three-way match which included Jerry Lynn.\n\nApart from a strong showing early, Skipper met with limited success, and was quickly recruited into Simon Diamond's The Diamonds in the Rough stable. From there, he proceeded to team with Diamond and David Young until the team was eventually phased out by TNA and Skipper was eventually released.\n\nLow Ki returned to TNA in April 2006 at the Lockdown 2006 pay per view as a surprise competitor. His opponent was none other than his former teammate, Christopher Daniels, who was originally scheduled to face Jushin Thunder Liger before the latter was forced to pull out of the event. Ki, now utilizing the name \"Senshi\", which translates directly from Japanese to \"Warrior,\" defeated Daniels before eventually going on to win the X Division championship just after Slammiversary 2006 in a three-way match against champion Samoa Joe and Sonjay Dutt. After Senshi lost the belt to Chris Sabin at Bound for Glory (2006), he faded into the background, participating in the Paparazzi Championship Series through the remainder of 2006 and early 2007. He went on to defeat Austin Starr at Final Resolution 2007.\n\nAt Victory Road 2007, Triple X officially reunited when Senshi and the returning Skipper helped Daniels win the Ultimate X match. It was explained on the July 19, 2007 edition of TNA Today that since Skipper had been released and then re-signed by TNA to a new contract, that the stipulation of he and Daniels never teaming again was null and void (since that was under the old contract). They won their return match against Serotonin on the July 19 episode of \"Impact\"!. They followed their victory up on the August 2 episode of \"Impact!\", where Daniels and Senshi defeated \"Black Machismo\" Jay Lethal and Sonjay Dutt with the help of Elix Skipper. After the match, there was a brief confrontation between them and The Motor City Machine Guns (Chris Sabin and Alex Shelley). Daniels and Senshi teamed together at Hard Justice 2007 to take on Jay Lethal and Sonjay Dutt and The Motor City Machine Guns in a triple threat match where Daniels was rolled up by Lethal taking the loss. On the following episode of \"Impact!\" Daniels' X Division Title shot was put on the line against Lethal which he lost after Lethal pinned him with the Lethal Combination.\n\nOn September 13 edition of \"Impact!\", Daniels would end up winning the bout over the champion Jay Lethal in a non-title match and being rewarded with a X Division Title match at Bound for Glory against Lethal. At Bound for Glory (2007), Daniels would lose the match against Lethal after a top rope Lethal Combination. On the same show Skipper and Senshi faced LAX in a number one contender's match for the TNA World Tag Team Titles in an Ultimate X match. They would also lose their match on the show as Hernandez would retrieve the X for LAX after a Border Toss of Skipper onto Senshi on the outside of the ring.\n\nChristopher Daniels and Senshi were sent to New Japan Pro Wrestling to represent TNA in a series of matches at Destruction '07. They were able to defeat Prince Devitt and Minoru in a tag team match.\n\nSenshi left TNA thus ending the tag team. Daniels was then kayfabe fired via the 'Feast or Fired' stipulation, but then appeared under his Curry Man gimmick before being kayfabe fired yet again at the next year's 'Feast or Fired'. He was previously portraying the role of 'Suicide' while Kaz was injured, and has since returned to his 'Fallen Angel' gimmick. Skipper rarely appeared from then on and was soon after released.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2112027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112027", "title": "Possibly Maybe", "text": "Possibly Maybe\n\n\"Possibly Maybe\" is a song by Björk, released as the fifth single from her 1995 album \"Post\". It is a song with deep electronic tones and soft beats that reflects on potential love.\n\nThere were three different single releases. This was the first Björk single to be released in three parts; two of these three parts are rarities in the music world in that their A-side is not the first track. The first CD came with a slipcase that could also house the other two.\n\nThe song has been covered at least twelve times by other artists.\n\nThe song details different stages of a breakup. Björk has said it was \"the first unhappy song I wrote… I felt ashamed writing a song that was not giving hope\". The melancholic piece was dedicated to her broken relationship with Stéphane Sednaoui, who, curiously, also directed the video. Rumours have persisted that Björk recorded the song in the nude, although this has not been publicly commented on. Björk was sued by British electronic musician Scanner for the uncleared sample of telephones ringing (from his album \"Mass Observation\") at the start of the track. The situation caused her record label, One Little Indian, to retire all current copies of \"Post\" in the shops, and release a new version of the album that included a version of \"Possibly Maybe\" without the sample. Later on, when the issue was solved, the single version of the song included the sample again, as it appears in the music video.\n\nThe B-side of single was \"Vísur Vatnsenda-Rósu\", taken from the 1994 album \"Chansons des mers froides\" by Hector Zazou. A short making-of was recorded as part of the album.\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Possibly Maybe\" was directed by French artist Stéphane Sednaoui, for a song that is about his failed relationship with Björk. The singer and the director had previously worked together in the music video for \"Big Time Sensuality\". In the clip, she appears \"as a goddess, floating out from a numinous light-streaked background.\" It shows Björk in a variety of different rooms in an apartment. She is primarily shown in a large, stylish bedroom with modern décor. These scenes are intercut with shots in ultra-violet lighting (which subsequently causes everything to appear in day-glo colours). She is also shown in three other rooms: submerged in the bathtub of a bathroom; an Asian-themed room; and a room full of stereo equipment. These scenes are intercut with an angelic image of her dressed all in white, floating out of a blue sky with the sun behind her. The majority of objects appearing in the video were Björk's own.\n\nSednaoui is known for having a particularly filmic technique for each of his clips; in \"Possibly Maybe\", the use of blacklighting \"makes Björk glow sensuously and perversely\". It was conceived in a theatrical way: nearly all of the scenes were filmed in the same space, which is transformed with changes in the \"mise en scène\". The style of \"Possibly Maybe\"'s scenery and Björk's wardrobe reference East Asian imagery, and a Japanese traditional doll is featured as Björk's only accompaniment; as a silent witness, it is the object on which the protagonist casts reflections on her own identity.\n\nShort interviews with both Stéphane and Björk discussing the video are included on the Stéphane Sednaoui \"\" DVD. The music video was included along with all of \"Post\"s music videos on the 1998 video release \"Volumen\", and its 2002 reissue \"Volumen Plus\". They also appear on \"Greatest Hits – Volumen 1993–2003\", a release that includes the videos featured on \"Volumen\" and \"Volumen Plus\".\n\nThe track was performed during the Post Tour, a performance of which can be found on the 1998 live DVD/VHS \"Live at Shepherds Bush Empire\", a fan-club only concert held at the end of the tour. To support the release of \"Post\", the song was performed on the UK TV show Later... with Jools Holland on 17 June 1995 with legendary slide guitarist BJ Cole. This performance was featured on Björk's 2003 DVD release \"Later\". Björk also performed the track on TFI Friday on 1 November 1996 to promote the official single release. The track was also included on a 1996 ChildLine charity album release, whose cover-art featured a parody of the \"Post\" cover. In support of this album, Björk performed the song on Top of the Pops. Björk's then manager Netty Walker noted later that it \"was the worst performance I've ever seen her do.\" A live performance recorded for US TV show \"Reverb\" in 2001 included a performance of \"Possibly Maybe\". The track has been performed on Björk's subsequent tours, the Homogenic Tour and the Vespertine World Tour, the latter version of which appears on the 2002 DVD release \"Live at Royal Opera House\". After 2001, the song was not performed live until March 2, 2012 at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City during her Biophilia Tour, using only a hang drum and a Tesla coil.\n\nThe release features remixes by Talvin Singh, Mark Bell from LFO, Dallas Austin, Trevor Morais (who was the drummer on the Post Tour), Photek and Plaid. The single was planned to coincide with Björk's tour dates in South America and South Africa in October 1996, although the South American concerts were cancelled only two shows in due to Björk suffering from laryngitis. Two live tracks (\"Possibly Maybe\" and \"Hyperballad\") recorded at Wembley Arena as part of a \"Top of the Pops\" show are included on CD3.\n\nUK CD1<br>\n\nUK CD2<br>\n\nUK CD3<br>\n\nUK CD promo<br>\n\nUK 12\" vinyl<br>\n\nUK 12\" Vinyl<br>\n\nUK 12\" Vinyl<br>\n\nThe track was covered by Final Fantasy and Ed Droste for music website Stereogum's 2008 online tribute to \"Post\". As Droste has stated, \"Björk is probably my most listened to and adored artist thus far in my life\".\n\nMichael Armstrong interpreted the song as an instrumental lullaby for the \"Rockabye Baby! Lullaby Renditions of Björk\" tribute album. London Resonance Quartet created another instrumental cover for tribute album \"Violently\". Italian singer Serena Fortebraccio recorded a version for the album \"In A Shape Of A Girl … Playing On Björk's Heartbeat\".\n\nThe artists, who released \"Possibly Maybe\" covers on their own releases include prog-rock band The Roots of Orchis, Polish jazz singer Monika Borzym, hip-hop artist Mumbls, jazz-funk bands Spirit Tuck and The Poma-Swank and the acts such as Wino Willy, Sallow, LumpyPork and others.\n\nA sample of this song was used in the bumpers for VH1's 'Insomniac Music Theater' late night music video block from the song's release until the program was cancelled in 2005 and renamed 'Nocturnal State'.\n\nDJ Shadow sampled this song for the track \"Mutual Slump\" from his debut album \"Endtroducing...\".\n\nCredits adapted from \"Post\"'s liner notes.\n\n\n"}

According to the website, people who accept nomination for inclusion in the book are sometimes qualified for various scholarship opportunities. While there were no required fees to be considered, there was the optional purchase of the listing publication.\n\n\"Who's Who Among American High School Students\" was one of three publications produced by Educational Communications, Inc. (ECI). ECI was part of American Achievement Corporation (AAC), located in Austin, Texas. AAC is one of 7 companies owned by Fenway Partners, based in New York City. ECI ceased operations on November 1, 2007.\n\nThere was much debate over the value of the book. Although it does not cost any money to be listed, it is often categorized as a scam since it is an attempt by a private company to make money through proud parents and students who purchase the book and various memorabilia (such as a \"commemorative keychain\") associated with the publication in attempt at recognition. There have been concerns about how students are nominated as well as whether the listing's entries are fact-checked and accurate.\n\nThe focus of another criticism was the fact of some students being excluded, apparently based on highly random or subjective factors, while others were included. In contrast to such things as academic, athletic, artistic or citizenship awards, which are based at least partly on demonstrable merit, these vanity publications seemed highly influenced by biased recommendations from teachers or even imaginary achievements stated by students (for example, claiming to star in school plays that never existed). Another issue raised, particularly as regards private schools, is that publications of this kind serve to challenge the standards of (for example) a Roman Catholic institution which sets its own norms for students' success in areas beyond academics and activities.\n\nIt has also been stated that scholarships were awarded, but in most cases these were for only 200 dollars and assigned (won) by random chance, similar to a lottery drawing.\n\nStudents consented to being listed in \"Who's Who\" in the hope that the listing would be seen by college admissions offices as a significant recognition of a student's academic and extracurricular involvement. However, most admissions officers believe that the recognition has no such value and in fact some consider the \"honor\" to be a joke. According to the admissions vice president of Hamline University, \"It's honestly something that an admissions officer typically wouldn't consider or wouldn't play into an admissions decision,\" adding that \"Who's Who...\" is just trying to sell books.\n\n\n"}

It was also directed by Erik Wiese and produced by Stephen Worth.\n\nThe first edition of \"Telegraph\", a fan magazine directed by Sjón, read: \"To the horror of parents everywhere two of the most disturbed minds in show business (have) come together to make what they promise will be the silliest, most demoralising and, as some depraved souls will undoubtedly say, funniest music video ever!\" The video has a surreal and humorous quality, with some sexual imagery.\n\nBjörk has red hair in both the animated and live parts of the video. One of Kricfalusi's characters, Jimmy the Idiot Boy (in which he was naked in some scenes and his private parts were removed), joins her during various parts of the video.\n\nAnother Kricfalusi character, George Liquor, makes a cameo in one scene. Also, Fred Flintstone makes a cameo in the scene of the bathroom. An edit was made of the video that covered Björk's breasts. The scene at the end of the music video showing Björk tearing an animated chicken in half was cut during showings on MTV.\n\nWhen Björk saw the storyboards, she said that Kricfalusi had \"made [her] very cute\", and was so pleased that she reportedly exclaimed, \"It's like Christmas!\" The video won a 1997 Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject.\n\nThe track was performed during the Post Tour. In support of the release of \"Post\" the song was performed on the television show \"The White Room\" in 1995, and on the Spanish television show \"Zona Franca\" in 1996, to promote the later single release. It was also notably performed on \"TFI Friday\" on 19 April 1996, with Howie Bernstein and the TFI Friday House Brass. This performance was later featured on the \"Post Live\" album.\n\nHaving not been performed live in over a decade, the song would later be performed during the Volta Tour with the Icelandic \"Wonderbrass\" brass section, sometimes also with fellow Sugarcubes vocalist Einar Örn on trumpet.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2112037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112037", "title": "Cumberland House, Saskatchewan", "text": "Cumberland House, Saskatchewan\n\nCumberland House is a community in Census Division No. 18 in northeast Saskatchewan, Canada on the Saskatchewan River. It is the oldest settler community in Saskatchewan and has a population of about 2,000 people. Cumberland House Provincial Park, which provides tours of an 1890s powder house built by the Hudson's Bay Company, is located nearby.\n\nThe community consists of the Northern Village of Cumberland House with a population of 772 and the adjoining Cumberland House Cree Nation with a population of 715. The community is served by the Cumberland House Airport and by Saskatchewan Highway 123.\n\nThe population of Cumberland House consists of mostly First Nations people, including Cree and Métis. Cumberland House was and is a Cree \"n\" dialect community, known in Cree as \"Waskahikanihk\".\n\nOn March 2013, Cumberland House Cree Nation had a registered population of 1387 with 814 members living on-reserve or crown land and 573 members living off-reserve. The First Nation has territory at five locations and is governed by a Chief and four councillors. It is a member of the Prince Albert Grand Council.\n\nFrom its foundation in 1774, Cumberland House was one of the most important fur trade depots in Canada. To the east, the Saskatchewan River led to Lake Winnipeg and on to the French at Montreal or the English on Hudson Bay. To the west, the river led to the Rocky Mountains and a pass to Oregon Country. To the north, the Sturgeon-Weir River led to the Churchill River which led to the Methye Portage and the rich Athabasca Country to the northwest. During the construction of Cumberland House the traders were challenged by the inland location and their unfamiliarity with crafting canoes. During the completion of the community's construction the traders had developed the required travel proficiency.\n\nCumberland House was used as a depot for east-bound furs and west-bound trade goods. It was also a depot for pemmican used to feed the voyageurs on their long journey to Lake Athabasca. Since it was in the forest belt, pemmican was brought downriver from the prairies or upriver from Lake Winnipeg. It was about 40 days' paddling time from the Hudson's Bay Company base at York Factory but nearly five months' journey from their competitor's base at Montreal. Cumberland House was located on a strip of land between the Saskatchewan to the south and Cumberland Lake to the north. The lake drained into the river a mile or so to the west. Today the strip is wider because of changes in the lake level.\n\nAs in much of Canada, the first European visitors were probably Coureurs des bois who left no records. The first European known to have passed the site was Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La Vérendrye, in the spring of 1749. Private fur trader Joseph Frobisher set up a temporary post on Cumberland Lake in 1772. Samuel Hearne established the permanent HBC post in 1774. It is sometimes said that this was the first inland post of the company. Strictly this was Henley House in 1743, but this was an isolated event. Cumberland House was the first post established when the inland policy was adopted. Hearne took the Grass River (Manitoba) route from York Factory which led him to Cumberland Lake. A month after Hearne finished building, Thomas and Joseph Frobisher arrived on their way to intercept HBC furs at Frog Portage. Next year Mathew Cocking was in charge and the two Frobishers reappeared along with Alexander Henry the elder.\n\nFrom 1778 to 1804, it was the administrative center of the western posts. In 1793, the North West Company built a competing post nearby. About the same time the Hudson's Bay Company fort was moved to a new site across from the North West Company post. In 1821, the two forts were merged. At that time there were 30 men at the post and about the same number of women and children. The post declined after about 1830, but revived somewhat with the introduction of steamboats on the river in 1874. By 1980, the powder magazine and the house of the Hudson's Bay Company manager were still there.\n\nOn June 24, 2005, Cumberland House residents were evacuated to Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, and housed in a shelter set up by the Red Cross at the SIAST campus due to impending flooding from the Saskatchewan River. The influx of water was from record breaking rainfall in Alberta where the North and South Saskatchewan Rivers collected the runoff from that rainfall.\n\nCumberland House is the northern terminus of Saskatchewan Highway 123. The first bridge connecting Pine Island, where the community is located, across the Saskatchewan River to the mainland was built in 1996, replacing a ferry during the summer months and ice crossings in the winter.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2112048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112048", "title": "Bachelorette (song)", "text": "Bachelorette (song)\n\n\"Bachelorette\" is a song by Björk, released as the second single from her 1997 album \"Homogenic\". Released on 8 December 1997, the song was originally written for a film by Bernardo Bertolucci, but the project was withdrawn. The lyrics for \"Bachelorette\" were written by Sjón, a friend and collaborator of the singer. The music video was noted for its surrealistic art direction, leading to a win at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nAs Björk tells in her website: \n\nThe song is emotionally charged and theatrical, following the album's theme of \"beats and strings\", but also includes other instruments like timbales, timpani, Alp horn, accordion, etc., that make the song stronger and more dramatic. Björk herself describes the song's story as \"Isobel goes to the city.\"\n\nThe surreal music video was directed by longtime Björk video collaborator Michel Gondry, and is an exploration of self-reference, featuring a dramatized version of the Droste effect. It features Björk as \"Bachelorette\", a woman who finds a book buried in her garden that begins to write itself, describing what Bachelorette does as she describes it; the book is entitled \"My Story\". \n\nShe takes the book to a publishing house, \"Clark Publishing\", in an unspecified large city that may be Chicago, and she and the publisher fall in love. (It becomes obvious, seeing and hearing excerpts from the book, that the book tells the story of how Bachelorette found the book, travelled to meet the publisher, and fell in love with him.) \n\nThe book becomes incredibly popular (at one point, all of Bachelorette's fellow passengers on a subway are seen reading it), and is turned into a musical, featuring Bachelorette as herself. The musical version includes the story of the musical itself, so at some point a mini theater is shown on the stage, featuring actors dressed as a small audience. \n\nAt some point later in the musical this mini musical features an even smaller version of itself, with an even smaller stage audience. The publisher, who is in the actual audience, becomes disgusted with seeing so many versions of himself, and breaks off the relationship; later, his character in the original musical does as well. The book becomes unpopular, and the original copy begins unwriting itself. \n\nBecause of this turn of events, a chain reaction occurs in the nested theatres, causing each to be nullified and revert to nature. Ultimately, the entire city devolves into the garden that appeared at the outset. The unwritten book finds its resting place buried in the ground once more, and Bachelorette ends up dancing and surrounded by wildlife.\n\nThe video was based on an original idea by Björk, who saw \"Bachelorette\" as a continuation of the character portrayed in \"Isobel\" and \"Human Behaviour\". The song lyrics of \"Isobel\" were also written by Björk's longstanding co writer Sjón. As Gondry describes it, \"this character is leaving the forest and she decides to go to the city to have a normal life. She tries her best and it doesn't work out and she comes back to the forest and she is happier there.\"\n\nThe art direction of the video was heavily praised. The video won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction. It was also nominated to the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards, but lost to Madonna's Ray of Light.\n\nThe song has been covered by Turkish singer Müslüm Gürses as \"Aşk Tesadüfleri Sever\" (\"Love Loves Coincidences\" in Turkish) and is given his name of album in 2006 and artist Voltaire. Tori Amos has also covered the song in concert, though not to be confused with another song written and performed by herself which shares the title. \n\nThe song has been covered by French post-black metal band The Great Old Ones in 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the book in the video, Björk wrote in her website the whole story appearing on it.\nThe story can be found here.\n\n"}
{"id": "2112054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112054", "title": "Victim impact statement", "text": "Victim impact statement\n\nA victim impact statement is a written or oral statement made as part of the judicial legal process, which allows crime victims the opportunity to speak during the sentencing of the convicted person or at subsequent parole hearings. \n\nOne purpose of the statement is to allow the person or persons most directly affected by the crime to address the court during the decision making process. It is seen to personalize the crime and elevate the status of the victim. From the victim's point of view it is regarded as valuable in aiding their emotional recovery from their ordeal. It has also been suggested they may confront an offender with the results of their crime and thus aid rehabilitation.\n\nAnother purpose of the statement is to inform a court of the harm suffered by the victim if the court is required to, or has the option of, having regard to the harm suffered by the victim in deciding the sentence.\n\nIn cases of crimes resulting in death, the right to speak is extended to family members. In some jurisdictions there are very different rules on how victim impact statements from family members may be regarded. This is because it is seen as unprincipled that different punishments for death are given according to the how much the victim is missed, or conversely that someone's death is relatively less harmful if they have no family. In the circumstance of death, some jurisdictions have described victim impact statements from family members as 'irrelevant' to sentence but not 'unimportant' to the process: they are valued for restorative purposes but cannot differentiate punishment for causing death.\n\nIn general terms, the person making the statement is allowed to discuss specifically the direct harm or trauma they have suffered and problems that have resulted from the crime such as loss of income. Some jurisdictions allow for attaching medical and psychiatric reports that demonstrate harm to the victim. They can also discuss the impact the crime has had on their ambitions or plans for the future, and how this also impacted their extended family.\n\nSome jurisdictions permit statements to express what they deem to be an appropriate punishment or sentence for the criminal.\n\nSome jurisdictions expressly forbid any proposal or suggestion on punishment or sentencing. Among other reasons, this is because the sentencing process is solely the domain of the judge who considers many more factors than harm to victims. Allowing suggestions on punishment or sentence can create a false hope of the eventual sentence and undermine the notion of restorative justice.\n\nIn civil cases, a victim impact statement may be used to determine how much is awarded to the plaintiff.\n\nThe first such statement in the United States was presented in 1976 in Fresno, California, and was passed as law in California in 1982, because of Doris Tate's concern that any members of the Manson family cult that killed her daughter, Sharon Tate, in 1969 might obtain parole.\n\nIn 1982, the Final Report of the \"President's Task Force on Victims of Crime\" recommended that \"judges allow for, and give appropriate weight to, input at sentencing from victims of violent crime.\" In 1992, the United States Attorney General released 24 recommendations to strengthen the criminal justice system's treatment of crime victims. The Attorney General endorsed the use of victim impact statements and stated that judges should \"provide for hearing and considering the victims' perspective at sentencing and at any early release proceedings.\"\n\nIn 1991, the Supreme Court of the United States held that a victim impact statement in the form of testimony was allowed during the sentencing phase of a trial in \"Payne v. Tennessee\" . It ruled that the admission of such statements did not violate the Constitution and that the statements could be ruled as admissible in death penalty cases.\n\nBy 1997, 44 of the American states allowed the presentation of victim impact statements during its official process, although until 1991 these statements were held as inadmissible in cases where the death penalty was sought. \n\nThe law varies in different states, and while most states allow statements to be made during the sentencing phase of the trial, Indiana and Texas allow for statements to also be made after sentencing.\n\nThe State of South Australia enacted law in 1988 specifically providing for Victim Impact Statements in the sentencing process, and other States followed with legislation that either provides specifically or generally for the tendering of victim impact statements as part of the sentencing process.\n\nAmong current issues with victim impact statements is their relative newness and a lack of research into their actual effectiveness against their theoretical goals. There are occasionally legal issues surrounding the admissibility of facts in a victim impact statement that are materially adverse to an offender.\n\nIn the State of Queensland, the Director of Public Prosecution guidelines require prosecutors to remove inappropriate or inflammatory material from Victim Impact Statements prior to them being submitted before a court to prevent any such issues.\n\nIn Finland, the victim has a right to recommend a punishment different from the one recommended by the prosecution.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2112059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112059", "title": "United States at the Olympics", "text": "United States at the Olympics\n\nThe United States of America (USA) has sent athletes to every celebration of the modern Olympic Games with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics, during which it led a boycott to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) is the National Olympic Committee for the United States.\n\nAmerican athletes have won a total of 2,523 medals (1,022 of them gold) at the Summer Olympic Games and another 305 (105 of them gold) at the Winter Olympic Games, making the United States the most prolific medal-winning nation in the history of the Olympics. The US is ranked first in the all-time medal table even if all the incarnations of Russia and Germany are combined, leading the second-placed Russians by 402 gold and 917 total medals. These achievements are even more impressive considering the fact that the American Olympic team remains the only in the world to receive no government funding.\n\nThe United States has hosted the Games on eight occasions, more than any other nation, and is planning to host the ninth:\nThe United States made its Olympic debut in 1896, when Athens hosted the very first edition of the modern games. The nation performed inconsistently in the pre-WW1 period primarily due to fielding considerably less athletes than hosting countries, with the exception being the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, where the US achieved its greatest medal haul in history, a record that still stands today. In the interwar period, America enjoyed its most successful spell, topping both gold and total medal counts at four straight Summer Games, before falling short in 1936, when Berlin hosted the games, and Germany used the event to push its political agenda. The next Olympics were held only in 1948 when WW2 hostilities ended. By this time, Germany was no longer a competitor to the US, with its place being taken by the Soviet Union, which went even further than the Germans and used the Olympics with a specific goal of pushing its ideological agenda. The Soviets clearly wanted to overtake the United States as a leading Olympic power and used any means they deemed necessary, including the use of professional athletes, something that was prohibited back then, and running a comprehensive state-sponsored doping program. The USSR ultimately achieved its goal, and after 20 years of fierce competition, it utterly thrashed America at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. After that, the US would not top the medal table in a non-boycotted games until the 1996 Summer Olympics, five years after the USSR collapsed. The 1970s and 1980s, therefore, became a dark moment for American Olympic teams, as they significantly fell behind not only the Soviet Union, but also East Germany, USSR's satellite state. The only bright spot was the 1984 Games in Los Angeles where the United States set a record for most gold medals won in a single Olympics, 83, primarily due to the Soviet-led boycott. In the 1990s, the situation started improving, and the US returned to the leading positions in the Summer Olympics, topping the medal table five times since 1992 and placing second on two occasions.\n\nContrary to its Summer Olympics status, America was never really considered a power in the Winter Games until the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. Therefore, its greatest achievements in the 20th century are more tied to specific events, rather than overall performances. However, hosting the games in 2002 gave a much needed boost to the US winter sports program, and since then the country performed consistently, never placing below fourth in the medal count, although America's performance has steadily declined since winning the most medals at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, with the US winning only 23 medals at the most recent 2018 Games in Pyeongchang compared to 37 in 2010.\n\n\"Updated on November 1, 2018\"\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>\"This table does not include two medals – one silver awarded in the ice hockey and one bronze awarded in the figure skating events at the 1920 Summer Olympics.\"\n\n\"Updated on November 1, 2018\"\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>\"This table includes two medals – one silver awarded in the ice hockey and one bronze awarded in the figure skating events at the 1920 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe very first modern Olympic Games that were held in Athens, Greece saw the Americans fielding 14 athletes that competed in three sports. The hosts, on the other hand, had 169 athletes competing and won 46 medals. The American team did its best, but managed to grab only 20 medals, being dwarfed by an enormous Greek team. However, the United States managed to get the most gold medals, 11, edging Greece that secured 10 golds. That allowed Team USA to finish first in the gold medal tally. James Connolly became the first modern Olympic champion by winning the triple jump, and Thomas Burke grabbed three gold medals in various track events, assuming the title of the most successful athlete of the 1896 Games.\nAt the 1900 Paris Olympics, the US team featured 75 athletes, a significant increase compared to 1896, but still considerably less than the French hosts that fielded 720 competitors. The most notable of all American participants was Margaret Abbott who became the first female American Olympic champion by winning the women's golf. The vast majority of American medals were won in the sport of athletics where US athletes clinched 16 gold and 39 medals overall. Team USA won only 8 medals outside of track, four of them in golf. Overall, France dominated the medal standings, winning 29 gold and 112 total medals. The United States ranked second with 19 and 48, respectively, showing great efficiency, despite having significantly less athletes.\nThe 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri were the first ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.\n\nThe 1948 London Olympics marked the first time that the newly communist countries, that were occupied by the Soviet Union after WW2, competed in the games. The Soviets themselves declined to compete, sending only observers, after a long hesitation that saw Soviet leader Joseph Stalin demanding guarantees from his sports officials that the USSR would beat the US in the medal standings. The Soviet officials told him that chances were 50/50, and Stalin ultimately rejected the idea of competing in 1948. With its newest political rival absent, the United States comfortably dominated the games, winning 38 gold and 84 total medals, 22 gold and 40 total medals more than the runner-up Sweden. The most medals were won in track and field, 27, and swimming, 15. The US basketball team won its second consecutive gold medal, defeating France in the final, 65–21.\nIn 1952, Helsinki saw the Soviets sending a team for the first time. This was a beginning of a new era, as the Soviet Union would go on to dominate the Olympics for the next four decades. The Soviets viewed the Olympics as international battlefield, where they can achieve their political goals by winning medals, thus proving their system’s superiority. The Soviet authorities also significantly bent the amateur rules, that were in place at the time, by providing state-funding to their athletes who trained full-time and, unlike American self-financed amateurs, were \"de facto\" professionals. That would start a significant controversy, that will result in the amateur rules being abolished, though only in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, meaning that the Soviets benefited from those rules throughout their Olympic history. The United States still topped the medal count at these games, winning 40 gold and 76 total medals, 22 gold and 5 total medals more than the Soviets who finished second. American athletes won 31 medals in track and field, their most successful sport. US basketball team won its third consecutive gold, twice defeating the Soviets in the process, American boxers won all five finals they entered, and American weightlifters edged their Soviet rivals 4 to 3 in terms of gold medals, with the two nations sweeping all seven events in the sport.\nMelbourne hosted the Olympics in 1956. There were calls for the expulsion of the Soviet Union following their invasion of Hungary, but the International Olympic Committee decided not to pursue any action. As a result, some nations boycotted the games in protest of the Soviets' presence, and the Hungarians themselves became engaged in a violent brawl with their Soviet counterparts in a water polo game, an event that was instantly called Blood in the Water. The US performance at the games was relatively successful, though it was getting harder and harder to compete with the Soviet machine. As a result, the Americans earned 32 gold and 78 total medals (second place in the medal standings), 5 gold and 24 total medals less than the first-placed Soviets. The US contingent was particularly successful in track and field, where American athletes amassed 31 medals. On the other hand, the US won only 2 golds in swimming, being unable to stop the Australian domination of the swimming events at these games. In weightlifting, the Americans and Soviets once again won all seven events, once again with a 4 to 3 ratio in favor of the US team. In boxing, the Soviets won 3 golds, while the Americans only managed to win two events. However, it was gymnastics where the USSR achieved its greatest success, winning 11 out of 17 events and guaranteeing the first place in the medal rankings. The US basketball team won its fourth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final game, 89–55.\nThe 1960 Rome Olympics saw the Americans losing their grip on their traditionally successful sports, such as track and field and weightlifting. On the other hand, boxing, swimming (where the Americans won 9 gold medals, while being controversially denied gold in the 100 meters freestyle, despite showing the best time), and wrestling produced unexpectedly good results, which somewhat helped to compensate for what was lost in other sports. In track and field, the Soviets won 11 golds, only one less that the Americans. It is worth mentioning that the US team encountered many problems throughout the meet, such as a controversial disqualification of their gold medal winning men's 4x100 relay team. In weightlifting, the Soviets, with the help of their state-of-the-art doping program, won five out of seven events, leaving the US with only one gold. 10 Soviet golds in gymnastics didn't surprise anyone, as the nation had always been a gymnastics powerhouse, but it did mean that the Soviets beat the Americans in the medal standings for the second straight summer games. The US basketball team, however, met the pre-tournament expectations and won its fifth consecutive gold medal, a noble feat, given that they had to compete against veteran pros from the USSR. The final result, 43 gold and 103 total medals for the Soviets to 34 gold and 71 total medals for the Americans, showed that America was no longer a leading force in Olympic competition.\nThere was some redemption for the US at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, as the nation returned to the top of the gold medal count for the first time since 1952. Particularly successful was the US swimming team that won 13 out of available 18 golds and shattered 9 world records. In track and field, the Americans also improved on their 1960 performance, winning 14 gold and 24 total medals, while the Soviets left Japan with 5 gold and 18 total medals, a significant downturn compared to their 1960 results. The Soviets, however, continued to dominate Olympic weightlifting, and, with the American program falling apart, the USSR produced four golds and three silvers. The Soviet Union hoped to replicate that success in gymnastics and wrestling, the sports that, together with weightlifting, were strongly associated with their athletic prowess. However, they encountered a zealous resistance from the Japanese, who used their home-field advantage to stun the Soviets, beating them five to three in wrestling golds, and winning five gymnastics championships to their four. Thus, Japan had a major influence on the US–USSR medals race, and most certainly helped the Americans edge their biggest rivals, while also managing to produce its best ever medal output and finishing in third place. For the Americans, despite their dismal performance in boxing where they achieved only one gold, the 1964 Olympics were a definite success, with the nation winning 36 gold and 90 total medals compared to the Soviet tally of 30 gold and 96 total medals. Therefore, the US topped the gold medal count, finishing second in the total medal count, while the USSR topped the total medal count, finishing second in the gold medal count. The US basketball team won its sixth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final, 73–59.\nThe 1968 Mexico Olympics became the most successful summer games for the US in the post-war era. American athletes amassed 45 gold and 107 total medals, 16 gold and 16 total medals more than the second-placed Soviets. The US swimming team dominated the competition, winning a staggering 51 medals and sweeping the podium on five occasions. The Americans also managed to medal in every single of 29 swimming events, thus achieving a unique feat. The US track and field team pulled off a stellar performance as well with 15 gold and 28 total medals. Overall, swimming and athletics accounted for more than 70% of all US medals, and ensured the first place in the medal table for the Americans, their second consecutive first-place finish in terms of gold medals, and their first finish at the top of the overall medal table since 1952. In other sports, however, the performance of American athletes was less convincing. The US weightlifting team continued to fade away, winning just one medal (compared to 7 in 1956), American boxers won 7 medals, though only two of them gold, US divers won 6 medals, and the men's volleyball team managed to stun the defending champions from the Soviet Union, beating them in five sets, but still finished out of medals; Soviets ultimately won gold, with their lone loss being to the US. In gymnastics, Japan continued to frustrate the Soviets, once again surpassing them in the medal standings. Last but not least, the US basketball team won its seventh consecutive gold medal, a feat not matched by any other Olympic team in ball sports. Very few would have assumed that this was the last time that the US finished first in the medal table in a fully attended Summer Olympics until 1996 (the Americans would top the medal standings in 1984 with the Soviet Union and its satellites boycotting).\n\nThe Munich Olympics saw the Soviet Union begin its streak of topping the medal count at five consecutive summer games in which they participated (1972–1992, though in 1992 they would compete as the \"Unified Team\" as the USSR dissolved half a year prior to the games, and the newly independent countries decided to compete together). The sporting nature of the event was largely overshadowed by the Munich massacre in the second week, in which eleven Israeli athletes and coaches and a West German police officer at Olympic village were killed by Black September terrorists. There were multiple calls to cancel the games after the terrorist attack, but the IOC declined. From a sporting standpoint, these games were one of the most controversial in history, with many accusing the organizing committee of anti-Americanism and trying to appease the Soviet Union and East Germany. Indeed, these were one the strangest Olympics ever for American athletes. US world record holders in the 100 meters were given the wrong starting time and were unable to compete in the event, thus paving the way for a Soviet to win. In swimming, the US gold medal winner in the 400 meters freestyle was stripped of his medal for using his prescription asthma medication, also depriving him of a chance at multiple medals. US boxers complained that they were judged unfairly in the bouts against their communist counterparts. In shooting, a US athlete initially won the 50 meters rifle only to be relegated to silver after a \"review\". Finally, in the most controversial event of the games, and one of the most controversial events of all time, the US basketball team was denied gold after apparently winning the final match against the Soviet Union. The final three seconds of the game were replayed three times until the Soviets came out on top. The Americans did not accept the silver medals, believing that they were robbed. This was the first US loss in Olympic basketball history and it ended the Americans' 63-game winning streak in Olympic basketball. In general, the US team greatly underperformed at these games, winning only 6 gold medals in track and field to the East Germans' 8 and Soviets' 9, though the Americans still won the most total medals, 22. In boxing, the Cubans and Soviets dominated, winning three and two championships, respectively, while the US won only one gold and four medals overall (compared to the Soviets' two and Cubans' five). In diving, the Americans won three medals; in soccer, the USSR and GDR fixed a bronze medal game, playing a tie, so both teams received bronze; in gymnastics, the Soviets edged their old rivals Japan to top the medal count; in weightlifting, the Soviets and Bulgarians won three golds each; in wrestling, the US team surprised with three golds in freestyle, yet the Soviets still dwarfed their medal tally with nine golds in freestyle and Greco-Roman (14–6 in total medals). In water polo, the Americans struck bronze, tying the eventual gold medalists the Soviet Union in the final round. Swimming was the only sport where the American team did not disappoint, winning 17 gold and 43 total medals, a good result, but still less than four years earlier. American women dominated swimming for the last time until 1992, as by 1976 they would be overtaken by East German dopers.\nThe Eastern Bloc utterly dominated the 1976 Montreal Olympics, with seven communist countries placing in the top ten of the medal table. The United States team was relegated to a third place in the medal standings for the first time in its history, courtesy of Soviet and East German doping systems and their use of professional athletes. This was the Olympics of contrasts: the US men's swimming team, despite a generally dismal showing of the delegation, completely obliterated their sport, sweeping 12 gold and 27 total medals in the 13 events that were on the program and shattering 11 world records in the process (this was arguably the most dominant performance of any swimming team in history), while the US women's swimming team, on the other hand, fell victim to the unbeatable East German dopers. They still managed to win a gold medal, in a shocking upset against East Germans in the 4x100 freestyle relay. The event was held on the last day of the swimming program, and the American women were risking to get shut out of gold for the first time in the US Olympic history. The victory was somewhat overlooked at the time, but since the early 1990s, when the crimes of the Soviet Bloc started to unravel, their gold medal is often considered to be one of the most improbable and heroic upsets of all time. In track and field, both the US men's and women's team were overwhelmed by East Germans who, as their Soviet masters expected, stole away a bulk of medals from the US in its signature sports, thus allowing the Soviets to win the medal table virtually unchallenged. The US boxing team surprised everyone, advancing to six gold medal bouts and winning five of them, drawing parallels to a stellar 1952 team that also took 5 golds. The achievement was even more momentous due to the fact that the American boxers were significantly younger and less experienced than their Cuban and Soviet counterparts. In other sports, US divers won 5 medals, including two golds; the US equestrian team took home 4 medals; American shooters won three medals, including a historic silver by a woman in the mixed 50 meters rifle three positions; US freestyle wrestlers advanced to four gold medal bouts, yet won only one of them (all four were against the Soviets), concluding the meet with 6 medals overall. The US men's basketball team reclaimed the gold medal, while the women's team won a surprising silver, being ranked no higher than sixth prior to the start of the tournament. The Soviets and East Germans were unstoppable in canoeing, gymnastics, rowing, weightlifting and wrestling, going 1–2 in the medal standings (49 gold and 125 total medals for the Soviets, and 40 gold and 90 total medals for East Germans). The US won medals in 14 sports, finishing third with 34 gold and 94 total medals. The most successful day for the Americans was July 31 when they won 8 gold and 18 total medals.\n\nThe 1980 Summer Olympics marked another first for the United States, as the nation led by far the largest and most significant boycott in the Olympic history. The boycott was motivated by the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, as well as by flagrant human rights violations in the USSR, and the regime's anti-Semitic policies. The Soviet state-run media ridiculed the Americans as sore losers who couldn't get over the fact that they were no longer a perennial Olympic power, and simply didn't want to be embarrassed by the Soviets who would thrash them in the medal count. Indeed, all medal predictions pointed to an inevitable Soviet victory with 55–60 gold medals. East Germans were forecast to win 40–45 gold medals, while the Americans would wind up in third place with 30–35 golds. However, the world will never know what would have happened, as the United States and 65 other countries chose not to attend the Moscow Games, leaving them with the smallest attendance since 1956. Predictably, the great majority of the medals were taken by the host country and East Germany in what was the most skewed medal tally since 1904. The Soviets amassed 80 gold (all-time record) and 195 total (second-best result after the US in 1904) medals in their anticlimactic performance.\n\nIn 1984, Los Angeles witnessed what was considered a retaliatory boycott by the Soviets and their satellites, although the Soviets cited security concerns and \"chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States.\" However, no threat to Eastern Bloc athletes was ever discovered, and the athletes from the Eastern Bloc country that did attend the 1984 games in Los Angeles—Romania—encountered no problems, and in fact were widely cheered above all other visiting nations at the Opening Ceremonies when they marched into the Coliseum (Romania ended up finishing third in overall medal count at the Games). The move by the Soviets left many \"dumbfounded\", as it was expected that they would try to thrash the US on their soil, thus achieving a significant propaganda victory. The forecasts again heavily favored the Soviet Union, with the Soviet athletes being expected to rack up 60–65 gold medals compared to 35–45 by the second-placed Americans. That didn't happen. Furthermore, despite the Soviet boycott, a record 140 nations (including China that participated for the first time since 1952) attended the games.\n\nThere were fears that the Soviet Union would boycott the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul as well because South Korea had no diplomatic relations with the USSR, which recognised and supported only North Korea. However, the policies of Perestroika that were initiated by Gorbachev in 1985 led to the Soviet participation in the games. Cuba, clearly not understanding such a betrayal, decided to boycott the Olympics on its own, impacting the boxing field as a result. The Soviet Union was steadily moving towards its ultimate collapse but its sporting empire was still in its prime. The Soviets and their close allies from East Germany utterly dominated the games, winning 55 and 37 gold medals respectively (132 and 102 total medals).\n\nDuring the Cold War period The Americans did their best to challenge the Soviets, but the playing field wasn't level. The Soviet athletes were funded by the state and trained full-time, while the US strictly obeyed the amateur rules and its athletes were primarily self-financed students who were significantly younger and less experienced than the Soviet veterans. In addition to that, the Soviets developed a state-sponsored doping system, and supplied performance-enhancing drugs to the vast majority of their athletes. Furthermore, they heavily invested in the development of a similar system in their satellite nation, East Germany, with a specific goal of making East Germans highly competitive in swimming and track and field, so that they can reduce the number of medals the Americans win in their signature sports. Unfortunately for the US, the Soviet strategy worked, and the gap between the USSR and US widened every four years until the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1972, the Soviets won 50 gold and 99 total medals to the Americans' 33 and 94; in 1976, the USSR amassed 49 gold and 125 total medals to the Americans' 34 and 94; 1980 Olympics were boycotted by the US and its allies, the Soviets retaliated in 1984 by boycotting the LA Olympics together with their satellites; finally, in 1988, the USSR won 55 gold and 132 total medals to the Americans' 36 and 94 (the US finished third at those games, losing even to the East Germans). In 1992, the Soviets still fielded a team despite the dissolution of their state, yet the margin of their victory over the Americans became narrower: 45 gold and 112 total medals to the Americans' 37 and 108. By 1996, every former Soviet republic formed its own National Olympic Committee, and the countries participated as independent nations, with Russia assuming the Soviet place in the IOC and inheriting Soviet achievements as by far the largest of the former Soviet republics. So, in 1996, the Americans finally managed to return to the top spot in the medal rankings, winning 44 gold and 101 total medals compared to 26 gold and 63 total medals won by the second-placed Russians, thanks to the partial abolition of the amateur rules in the early 1990s (the American athletes still weren't state-sponsored, unlike their foreign counterparts, but they were now eligible for prize money and sponsorships). They were still disadvantaged by these rules in those sports where they weren't abolished (i.e. boxing, baseball, where Cubans continued to field state-sponsored pros against American amateurs), but the situation started improving.\n\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The 1912 Olympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds.\n\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis. The situation greatly disadvantaged American athletes, and was a major factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from amateurism, as envisioned by Pierre de Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes, but only in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its influence within the International Olympic Committee.\n\nRussia (in all its incarnations) and the United States have won more Olympic medals than any other nation. Russia topped the overall medal count at 7 Summer Olympics and 9 Winter Olympics, while the United States placed first at 17 Summer Olympics and 1 Winter Olympics. The countries developed a strong rivalry during the Cold War, and while the tensions eased in the 1990s, the relations deteriorated in 2014 and 2016.\n\nSince the 1952 Summer Olympics, Russia has won 1912 Summer and Winter Olympics medals, the most in that period, while the United States has won 1873 medals, the second most in that period.\nDetailed comparison is presented below.\n\nMedal totals of the Soviet Union/Unified Team/Russia and the United States since 1952, when the Soviet Union started to compete.\n\nOverall, the United States (1896–1976, 1984–present) has won 1,022 gold and 2,523 total medals, and Russia (1900, 1908–1912, 1952—1980, 1988–present) has won 589 gold and 1,556 total medals.\n\nMedal totals of the Soviet Union/Unified Team/Russia/Olympic Athletes from Russia and the United States since 1956, when the Soviet Union started to compete.\n\nOverall, the United States (1924–present) has won 105 gold and 305 total medals, and Russia (1956–present) has won 136 gold and 354 total medals.\n\nThe United States and Soviet Union sporting adversary reached its peak during the Cold war. The U.S. men's team was considered a favorite in the run-up to the 1972 Games. Since the first Olympic basketball tournament at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, the Americans haven't lost a single game, winning seven consecutive gold medals in a dominating fashion. Their record reached an unprecedented 63-0 before the final game. Since the 1952 tournament the Soviet team challenged the Americans, winning silver in 1952, 1956, 1960, 1964 and bronze in 1968. Outside of the Olympics, the Soviets had already defeated the U.S. team in the World Championship play. However, the Americans never sent their best collegiate players to that tournament.\n\nIt is important to note that the Olympics strictly prohibited any involvement of professional athletes at the time. The Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries used that rule to their advantage, listing all its top players as soldiers or workers what allowed them to breach the amateur rules. Western experts classified these athletes as professionals. On the other hand, leading American players were unable to play in the Olympics as they were officially professional and played in the NBA. That disadvantage hadn't prevented the Americans from winning the first seven Olympic basketball tournaments without a single defeat.\n\nThe confrontation of the Soviet Union and United States on the basketball court was deeply connected to the confrontation on the political front. Many American viewers assumed that 1972 Games were openly anti-American. There were rumors that the Communist party had bribed the officials because they wanted the USSR to win 50 gold medals at these Olympics in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe United States team was the youngest in history. American players usually participated in the Olympics once before turning pro, and the U.S. team always had new players every four years. The 1972 team didn't have a clear leader. A rising star Bill Walton declined an invitation to participate. Nevertheless, the team was heavily favored featuring such players as Doug Collins or Tommy Burleson (the tallest player among all teams).\n\nThe young American team was confronted by a veteran Soviet team, featuring stars Sergei Belov, Modestas Paulauskas, and Alexander Belov. The players had played together for more than seven years. For Gennadi Volnov it was the fourth Olympic appearance.\n\nThe Soviets performed strongly at the beginning, winning the first half 26:21. The Soviets kept the Americans 4–8 points behind during the first half.\n\nIn the second half Soviets targeted Dwight Jones, as they considered him the leader of the U.S. team. On the 28th minute he was provoked by Mikheil Korkia and responded. Both players were sent off. The Soviets were satisfied, as they deemed Korkia less significant for them than Jones for the Americans. The next minute Alexander Belov hit Jim Brewer during the free-throw, and Brewer was unable to continue playing. According to the Americans, the referees did not notice the foul.\n\nWith 10 minutes left, the Soviets increased their lead to 10 points. After that Americans finally started to press the Soviets. It helped them to cut the deficit to 1 point. Soviet players started to feel nervous. With less than a minute left, Doug Collins stole a Soviet pass at halfcourt and was fouled hard by Zurab Sakandelidze as he drove toward the basket, being knocked down into the basket stanchion. With three seconds remaining on the game clock, Collins was awarded two free throws and sank the first to tie the score at 49. Just as Collins lifted the ball to begin his shooting motion in attempting the second free throw, the horn from the scorer's table sounded, marking the beginning of a chain of events that left the game's final three seconds mired in controversy. Although the unexpected sound of the horn caused lead referee Renato Righetto to turn away from the free throw attempt and look over to the scorer's table, play was not stopped. Collins never broke his shooting motion and continued with his second free throw, scoring to put the U.S. ahead by a score of 50:49. Immediately following Collins' free throws, the Soviets inbounded the ball and failed to score. Soviet coaches claimed that they had requested a timeout before Collins' foul shots. The referees ordered the clock reset to three seconds and the game's final seconds replayed. The horn sounded as a length-of-the-court Soviet pass was being released from the inbounding player, the pass missed its mark, and the American players began celebrating. Nevertheless, final three seconds were replayed for a third time. This time, the Soviets' Alexander Belov and the USA's Kevin Joyce and Jim Forbes went up for the pass, and Belov caught the long pass from Ivan Edeshko near the American basket. Belov then laid the ball in for the winning points as the buzzer sounded.\n\nThe Americans regained the basketball crown in 1976, but their ability to stay competitive with college players against seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union was decreasing. In 1988, the Soviets beat the United States once again, eliminating them in the semifinals. That game was a turning point in international basketball, as FIBA officials started to realize that amateur rules were extremely unfair. In 1989, NBA players were finally allowed in the Olympics.\n\nThe 1980 hockey game between the U.S. and USSR was dubbed the \"Miracle on Ice\", when American college players defeated the heavily favored seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union on the way to a gold medal at the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more. Though ice hockey is not a major sport in most areas of the United States, the \"Miracle\" is often listed as one of the all-time greatest American sporting achievements. The U.S. also won the gold medal in the 1960 Games at Squaw Valley, California, defeating the Soviet Union, Canada, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden along the way. However, since this victory is not as well known as the 1980 win, it has come to be known as the \"Forgotten Miracle\".\n\nThe U.S. and the Soviet Union next met at the Olympics in 1988. As in 1980, the Soviets were represented by their star-studded veterans, while the Americans fielded a team of college players. The Soviets won the encounter 7–5 and went on to win the gold medal, while the U.S. placed seventh.\n\nThe two teams met again at the 1992 Olympics in a semi-final match. There, the Unified Team (the successor to the Soviet Union) won 5–2. While some stars had left the Soviet Union to play in the NHL, the Unified Team still boasted many veterans from their domestic professional league, while the Americans were represented primarily by college players. The Unified Team eventually won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed fourth.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia (the successor to the Unified Team) met twice at the 1996 World Cup of Hockey. The Americans won both games 5-2 en route to the tournament championship.\n\nThe U.S., coached by Herb Brooks, and Russia, coached by Slava Fetisov, met twice in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, which included a 2–2 round-robin draw and a 3–2 semi-final win for the Americans. The semi-final match was played 22 years to the day after the \"Miracle on Ice\" game. The U.S. eventually won silver, while Russia won bronze.\n\nThe two teams met in the quarterfinals of the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, with the U.S. earning a decisive 5-3 victory.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia played each other in a round-robin game at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The game was tied 2–2 after overtime before the Americans prevailed in an eight-round shootout, with T.J. Oshie scoring on 4 of 6 attempts for the United States. The match has been dubbed by some as the \"Marathon on Ice\" due to its length. Both teams, however, failed to medal; the Americans finished fourth (losing in the semis to Canada and to Finland in the bronze medal game), while the Russians placed fifth (losing to Finland in the quarterfinals).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2112063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112063", "title": "Hunter (Björk song)", "text": "Hunter (Björk song)\n\n\"Hunter\" is a song recorded by Icelandic musician Björk for her third studio album \"Homogenic\" (1997). The lyrics explore the pressure Björk felt to write music after realising the workforce that depended on her, following the success she found as a solo artist with her previous studio albums. The song was first performed at the 1997 Tibetan Freedom Concert and later included with the online promotional release of \"Homogenic\"; the track was subsequently released as the third single for the album as three different CD releases in October 1998. A collaborative effort between Björk and Mark Bell, \"Hunter\" features a dark combination of strings and layered synths, a militaristic electronic beat, and enigmatic lyrics about the heading towards a mission.\n\nMost music critics were enticed by \"Hunter\", which they declared one of the highlights of the \"Homogenic\" album. The single charted poorly, peaking at number 44 on the UK Singles Chart and number 55 on the French Singles Chart. The song was included in the compilation album \"Greatest Hits\" (2002), whose tracks were selected by fans through a survey.\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Hunter\" was directed by longtime collaborator Paul White of Me Company and consists of a close-up of a bald Björk as she transforms into a \"techno-bear\" while singing. Seeking to convey the music's fusion of organic and technological, the polar bear was animated in a non-naturalistic fashion; the bear also embodies the ferocious hunter the lyrics represent. The song's video garnered acclaim from critics. Björk has performed \"Hunter\" on \" Later... with Jools Holland\" and in five of her tours, the most recent being the Vulnicura Tour.\n\nThe opening track of \"Homogenic\", \"Hunter\" showcases the hybrid elements of strings and electronic backing beats through the album. It blends the live sound of the Icelandic String Octet —orchestrated by Eumir Deodato—, Yasuhiro Kobayashi's accordion and \"stuttering computer beats and beeps\" programmed by Mark Bell. Music journalist Evelyn McDonnell wrote \"the production showed Björk's steeping in the cutting edge of electronic dance-music culture, her embrace of techno futurism, her time spent pulling all-nighters in London clubs. But the emotion was ancient, deeply human\". The song has been described as \"dark\", \"uncompromising\" and \"icy\". According to \"Ray Gun\", \"Hunter\" evokes an eerie terrain with rolling techno beats and strings penetrating the air like a toxic fog. Björk's vocals have been much celebrated in the track. They have been described as what \"[ties] the whole shebang together together [...]: full of reverberating menace and trepidation on the verses, then bursting into full-throated confession, layers of her voice pitching next to each other then cascading together\". \"The Wire\" wrote that Björk's voice \"oscillates between steely-edged determination and uncontained freedom\".\n\nBjörk incorporated elements of traditional Icelandic culture. She uses the interval of the fifth throughout the song, such as in the cellos; fifths were common in Icelandic folk songs. Elements of Maurice Ravel's \"Boléro\" were also noted. René T. A. Lysloff and Leslie C. Gay, Jr. wrote: \"one of the three main sections of the whole song is the Bolero ostinato (0:00-1:36). The sounds Björk uses to cover the rhythmic patterns from \"Bolero\" are tightly interwoven\".\n\nThe song features \"militaristic\" electronic percussion programmed by Mark Bell. Björk recorded the vocals, bassline and chord structure before Bell met her in Spain; after she explained how she wanted the percussion to sound, Bell recorded one take on a Roland TR-909 drum machine. Engineer Markus Dravs said: \"The idea of it being a Balearic beat was [Björk's] ... We all had a go on the filtering and played around with the decay of each individual drum.\"\n\nBjörk sings: \"If travel is searching / And home has been found / I'm not stopping / I'm going hunting\". Sal Cinquemani of \"Slant Magazine\" noted self-mockery towards \"her own idyllic disposition\" in the lyrics \"I thought I could organize freedom / How Scandinavian of me!\" That line was covered in various reviews; it has been described as \"hilarious\" and \"derisively\" delivered. When asked about the meaning of those lines, Björk replied: Some critics interpreted the line as an allusion to a failed relationship. Björk said: \"'Hunter' is based on what my grandma told me at Christmas; about two different types of birds. One bird always had the same nest and partner all their lives. The other was always travelling and taking on different partners. At some point there was a conscious decision made to remain a hunter.\" \n\nAccording to Björk, the lyrics express how she felt obliged to produce music because of the people that occupationally depended of her. The lyrics \"I will bring back the goods/But don't know when\" refer to her songwriting process; in her own words: \"Sometimes I don't do things that people I work with do —like spend time with families and lead a normal life. I have to isolate myself and put myself in a state so I will write a song.\" After the success Björk encountered as a solo artist with \"Debut\" (1993) and \"Post\" (1995) — her most promoted album —, she began to feel more pressured as she noticed how her creative output directly affected the life of those around her. In an interview with Dave Hemingway she stated: \n\n\"Hunter\" was first released in the promotional Internet release of \"Homogenic\" before the album was released. In early 1998 it was announced that \"Alarm Call\" would be released as the next single off the album, followed by \"Hunter\". By March of that year, still no release dates were specified, although the production of the music video was announced. In April, plans for \"Alarm Call\" as the next single were suspended and \"Hunter\" was chosen instead. The single was first released in France. The release date of \"Hunter\" was confirmed to be 5 October 1998 in September. There were three different CD releases of \"Hunter\" in the United Kingdom, they were subsequently released in a box set in early 1999. \"Hunter\" was also included in the \"best of\" album \"Greatest Hits\" (2002), whose track list was determined by fans through an online survey.\n\n\"Hunter\" garnered acclaim from music critics, who complimented its elaborate production, its haunting melody and cryptic lyrics. Marvin Lin from Tiny Mix Tapes called it \"painfully beautiful\". Jack Dickey of Deadspin considered \"Hunter\" one of the only two songs in the album where \"the instruments win out\" and wrote it \"is like \"Peter and the Wolf\" if, instead of a merciful hunter, Artemis were chasing the wolf.\" In a review for the single release, Keir Langley of AllMusic praised the rhythm and intensity of the track as a showcase of her collaboration with Mark Bell. \"The Wire\"'s Louise Gray thought it was an \"extraordinary, mesmeric song.\" Evelyn McDonnell wrote \"I myself had used the prevalent critical category for Björk uncategorizable amalgalm of styles: 'quirky.' There was nothing quirky about 'Hunter.'\" She also praised the song's originality and appeal to various types of listeners. Phil Freeman included \"Hunter\" in his list of songs which \"say something important about the state of music since 1979—how venerable forms have changed;\" inspired by Greil Marcus' attempt to define rock and roll in \"Stranded\" (1978). He wrote \"her voice is protean and capable of astonishingly raw, forceful outbursts, but it's when she holds it in, on tracks like this one, that her real power emerges.\" Authors Shirley R. Steinberg and Donaldo Pereira Macedo identified elements of Donna Haraway's \"A Cyborg Manifesto\" in \"Hunter\". They state that, by assuming the position of authority in relation to the masculine other, Björk challenges the traditional notions of femininity; and that by \"[leaving] to be the hunter,\" she \"disrupts the nature/culture binary of which Haraway speaks.\"\n\nThe music video for \"Hunter\" was directed by longtime collaborator Paul White from Me Company, the design firm that produced the artwork of \"Homogenic\" and \"Post\", and their respective singles. Computer animation was handled by Digital Domain. The live-action portion of the video was shot in London in 12 takes, with Björk performing in front of a green screen; she wore makeup to simulate baldness and tracking markers were applied to her head and face for subsequent computer graphics work. A second performance was later shot with the singer's face marked up with infrared dots as a reference for animators to create convincing facial contortions, and a paper clay polar bear head was scanned next to Björk's head for modeling guidelines.\n\nBoth Alistair Beattie —producer and member of Me Company— and Björk have used the word \"techno\" to refer to the design of the polar bear. To coincide with the song's fusion of organic and technological, it was deliberately designed in a non-photorealist manner. In an interview for \"I.D.\" magazine in November 1997, Beattie said:\n\nPost-production took place in California, where Digital Domain received all data. Using Autodesk Softimage and proprietary software, they tracked Björk's movements from the two marker sets and then began key frame animation using Autodesk Maya, Autodesk Alias and Autodesk Softimage. By combining patch deformation and shape interpolation, the emerging bear head was created, composed of \"100 maneuverable platelets that rise up through the skin.\" Finally, rendering was completed using Pixar's RenderMan, a holographic shader was used to make the bear skin colors change, and all the computer graphics were added to the live-action footage. According to \"The Wire\", post-production work brought the costs of the video up to £250,000.\n\nThe video begins with a white screen followed by a fade-in of a close-up of a bald Björk. She passionately sings looking into the camera; as she shakes and moves her head, she begins to morph into a polar bear. Towards the end of the video, she completely transforms into the \"techno-bear\", before returning to her original state and the image once again fading-out to white.\n\nThe video received critical acclaim. \"Freeze Frame\" deemed the video \"primal\" and complimented Björk on keeping the attention of the viewer by only showing her head and shoulders, thus comparing it to \"Sledgehammer\" by Peter Gabriel. \"I.D. Magazine\" praised its special effects, writing they \"reach a new level of detail in [the music video]\" and compared the singer's transformation to that of the title character in Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\". Louise Gray of \"The Wire\" described the music video as \"extraordinary\" and \"deeply affecting\". Cultural theorist Dominic Pettman, while analyzing the \"becoming-animal\" theorized by Deleuze and Guattari, found that the video for \"Hunter\" —along with the character Treadwell in Herzog's \"Grizzly Man\"— embodied various points these philosophers studied regarding that concept. Shirley R. Steinberg and Donaldo Pereira Macedo wrote that in the music video, Donna Haraway's metaphor of \"A Cyborg Manifesto\" appears in \"Björks embodiment of a human-animal-machine hybrid.\"\n\nEvelyn McDonnell has identified bears and hunters as recurring themes in Björk's videos. The bear was used as a \"literal symbol of strength, ferocity, self-determination and the North, a pioneering roaming spirit.\" Beattie has stated that as the song is about the two different states of the hunter and the gatherer, \"the polar bear is the perfect symbol of the hunter state, it polarizes (ahem!) [\"sic\"] the difference between the two into something really extreme and magical.\" When asked why the video is \"so stark\", Beattie compared it to kōans and haikus in the sense that \"it tries to ask the question in the most interesting manner possible,\" and added that \"[they] wanted the effects to be done right in front of your eyes\" so that \"the magic and illusion are all the more powerful.\" About the concept behind the video, White said:\nIn an interview with \"The Wire\", Björk said that the video \"[is] about the argument between hunting experiences and stopping and settling.\" She has also stated to \"Interview\" that she identifies with polar bears because \"they're very cuddly and cute and quite calm, but if they meet you they can be very strong.\" \"Freeze Frame\" wrote: \n\n\"Hunter\" was the runner-up for the Prix PIXEL-INA Vidéoclip at the 1999 Imagina festival. At the 2000 Fantasporto film festival of Porto, Portugal, Björk received the Audience Choice award for the music video.\n\nBjörk presented the song —and three more songs off the then-unreleased \"Homogenic\"— at the Tibetan Freedom Concert on 6 June 1997, as a sneak peek of the album. She performed with Mark Bell, who was raised at the rear of the stage surrounded by keyboards and sequencers, and with the Icelandic String Octet conducted by Eumir Deodato at one side of the stage. She wore a pink dress designed by Hussein Chalayan, which she would later wear in the video for \"Bachelorette\" and photoshoots. That July, Björk performed the whole album for a press conference and presentation concert regarding \"Homogenic\" at the Old Truman Building, an old beer factory in London, wearing the same outfit. During the brief Homogenic Promotional Tour, which took place from 31 August to 10 September 1997, \"Hunter\" was the opening track of the set. Björk also performed the track with the Icelandic String Octet and Mark Bell on the British TV show \"Later... with Jools Holland\", a performance that was included in the 2003 DVD release of the same name.\n\nThe song was part of the set list of the Homogenic Tour which Björk embarked with Mark Bell and the Icelandic String Octet from late 1997 to early 1999. A performance of \"Hunter\" at the Cambridge Corn Exchange during the tour was included in the video release \"Live in Cambridge\" (2001). Björk's June 1998 performance of the song in Paris was released in \"Homogenic Live\", a live album of the tour included in the box set \"Live Box\" (2003). \"Hunter\" was also performed —usually as the opening track— during the Greatest Hits Tour of 2003, which once again featured the Icelandic String Octet, but with the addition of Vespertine World Tour collaborators Matmos and Zeena Parkins.\n\n\"Hunter\" was also performed during the Volta Tour (2007–08), a tour she undertook with Mark Bell, Jónas Sen, Damian Taylor, Chris Corsano and a 10 piece female brass band. Several of the concerts were part of festivals, including Coachella, Glastonbury and Rock en Seine, among others. Live performances of \"Hunter\" during the tour were included in the box set \"Voltaïc\" (2009), specifically the CD \"Songs from the Volta Tour Performed Live at the Olympic Studios\" and the DVD \"The Volta Tour\" (\"Live in Paris\"). The track was also part of the set list of Björk's latest tour, the Biophilia Tour (2011–13), whose schedule featured both a residency format and a conventional stage format for the festival dates. \"Hunter\" was performed mainly at festival dates and outdoor facilities.\n\n\"Hunter\" was used in the 1998 film \"The X-Files\", directed by Rob Bowman. It was subsequently included in the official soundtrack, \"\", which appeared in several charts upon its release.\n\nIn 2005, American rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars covered the song and placed it as a bonus track on their second studio album, \"A Beautiful Lie\". The song was not originally a part of the album, but was recorded and added to the track listing after the album leaked several months before it was to be released. Lyrically, it changes the word \"Scandinavian\" for \"American\" in the line \"I thought I could organize freedom/How Scandinavian of me!\", and the line \"You just didn't know me\" was added towards the end of the song. Brian Orloff from the \"Tampa Bay Times\" was impressed with the cover version, writing that Thirty Seconds to Mars erects \"riveting tension\" in its \"almost trip-hop\" rendition of the song. \"Rock Sound\" magazine also responded positively to the track and described it as \"an absinthe-soaked techno rendering.\" Kaj Roth from \"Melodic\" felt that the band \"really caught the spirit\" of the song; however, Kirsty Krampf of \"DIY\" thought it was \"a criminal re-hash.\"\n\nA cover by RIAYA featuring John Mark McMillan was used in the first teaser trailer for the 2019 film \".\"\n\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from \"Homogenic\" liner notes.\n\n"}

It was released as the fourth single from the album, peaking at number 33 in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe sped-up \"radio version\" of the song (which was also featured in the video) was used in the 1999 film \"The Mod Squad\".\n\nThe song, originally labelled \"Jacko\" on the \"Homogenic\" demo tape, speaks of reawakening through music. Björk explained: \"I think that music has the power to change the things, and that's what I wanted to show on Alarm Call\". It is the only single from \"Homogenic\" that was not included on \"Greatest Hits\".\n\nThe first music video for \"Alarm Call\" was directed by Paul White from Me Company, the design firm that produced the artwork of \"Homogenic\", \"Debut\" and \"Post\", and their respective singles, and it featured Björk in a similar dress to the one featured on the \"Homogenic\" album cover along with a dance scene in the Los Angeles Subway. \n\nHowever, Björk was not pleased with the result and a second video was directed by fashion designer Alexander McQueen and filmed in February 1998, over a two-day period in London. She told MTV News that she felt that the music video industry needed a \"spank on the bum\", and that McQueen was the man to do the video. \n\n\"I haven't seen many fashion shows in my life, but you go to his shows and you come out feeling like anything is possible\"; she went on to describe McQueen as a \"guy with a powerful and fluid mind who could direct films, build castles, and write music\". He wrote up a nearly one-hundred-page treatment of his ideas for the video. \n\nIt features Björk floating on a raft on a river in the jungle and her scenes are intercut with footage of snakes, crocodiles, and other animals, with Björk playing with them. The version of the song used in the video is the radio mix by Andy Bradfield and Mark Bell.\n\nThese are the formats and track listings of major single releases of \"Alarm Call\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench mix\n\n"}

Some were kidnapped or tricked (or \"blackbirded\") into long-term indentured service. At its height, the recruiting accounted for over half the adult male population of some islands.\n\nThere were 60,000 people who were kidnapped or “blackbirded”.\n\nThese people were generally referred to as Kanakas, which means \"man\", although many Islander descendants now regard the term as pejorative and an insulting reminder of their ancestors' exploitation at the hands of white planters.\n\nWith time, owing to intermarriage, many Australian South Sea Islanders also claim a mixed ancestry, including Aboriginals, Torres Strait Islanders and immigrants from the South Pacific Islands.\n\nOf some 55,000 to 62,500 Islanders recruited, around 10,000 remained in Australia in 1901. The majority were repatriated by the Australian Government in the period between 1906 and 1908 under the \" Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901\", a piece of legislation related to the White Australia policy. There was resistance to repatriation, and controversy regarding the manner in which it was done.\n\nThose exempted from repatriation, along with a number of others who escaped deportation, remained in Australia to form the basis of what is today Australia's largest non-indigenous black ethnic group. Today, the descendants of those who remained are officially referred to as South Sea Islanders. A 1992 census of South Sea Islanders reported around 10,000 descendants living in Queensland. Fewer than 3,500 were reported in the 2001 Australian census.\n\nThe question of how many Islanders were \"blackbirded\" is unknown and remains controversial. The extent to which Islanders were recruited legally, persuaded, deceived, coerced or forced to leave their homes and travel to Queensland is difficult to evaluate and also controversial. Official documents and accounts from the period often conflict with the oral tradition passed down to the descendants of workers. Stories of blatantly violent kidnapping tend to relate to the first ten or so years of the trade.\n\nIn recent generations, facing many similar forms of discrimination in Australia as Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders, Australian South Sea Islanders have been prominent figures in civil rights and politics. Faith Bandler, Evelyn Scott and Bonita Mabo (widow of Eddie Mabo) are prominent Indigenous activists who are also descendants of South Sea Island plantation workers. Stephen Andrew, who represents One Nation in the Queensland Parliament, was the first South Sea Islander to be elected to parliament.\n\nAnother area Australian South Sea Islanders have excelled in is sport, especially the game of rugby league. Australian international representatives Mal Meninga, Sam Backo, and Gorden Tallis are all members of the Australian South Sea Islander community.\n\n\n"}

Highly regarded for his appearance he was expected to make a successful transition into American films, after appearing opposite Jean Seberg, \"In the French Style\" (1963).

It proved popular with both European and American audiences and Forquet travelled to Hollywood to work for 20th Century Fox. He was touted as the handsomest new actor in Hollywood, a cross between Montgomery Clift and Louis Jourdan.\n\nHe co-starred with Sandra Dee in \"Take Her, She's Mine\" as her romantic interest, and while the film was popular, it did not lead to other projects. During this time Forquet became engaged to the American actress Sharon Tate, however the relationship ended because of career conflicts.

He was a right-handed batsman and off-spin bowler, who came to prominence in the late 1980s in a side that included such players as Gordon Greenidge, Desmond Haynes, Malcolm Marshall and Courtney Walsh and represented the West Indies over a 16-year international career.\n\nHis highest innings score of 233 was made during a Test match against India in 2002 at Bourda, Guyana. He has made 5,762 runs in his Test cricket career.\nHooper represented Guyana at local first-class level, and played English county cricket for Kent and Lancashire. In 2003, Hooper became only the second player to have scored a century against all 18 county teams.\n\nHooper holds the accolade of being the first cricketer in the world to have scored 5,000 runs, taken 100 wickets, held 100 catches and received 100 caps in both ODIs and Tests, a feat only matched since by Jacques Kallis. In his autobiography, Steve Waugh writes that \"quickness of feet and sweet yet brutally efficient stroke play were Hooper's trademarks.\" He was routinely prematurely dismissed, however, after losses in concentration.\n\nShane Warne also thought very highly of Hooper's footwork and, in 2008, named him among the top 100 cricketers of his time, citing in particular his ability to disguise his dances down the track. Warne felt that determining when a batsman was going to give the charge was one of the most important things for a spinner, and that Hooper was the best at making it indeterminable. \"During the 1995 series,\" he wrote, \"this really nagged away at me, because I couldn't spot any of the usual clues even though I knew there had to be a sign that would give him away. On a number of occasions, I stopped at the point of delivery to see if he was giving anything away with his footwork. Most batsmen would be looking to get out of their ground at that point, whereas Hooper just stayed set. In the end, after watching him closely time after time, I managed to crack it. When he wanted to hit over the top, he just looked at me instead of tapping his crease as usual and looking down. Of course, my knowing what he was going to do did not always stop him from doing it.\"\n\nHooper was also a strong slip fielder, usually at second slip. He took numerous catches from the likes of Ambrose and Walsh. He is one of only three players to have scored centuries against 18 different English county sides.\n\nHooper first announced his retirement three weeks before the 1999 Cricket World Cup but made a surprising comeback in 2001 and captained the West Indies team in 2003 Cricket World Cup. West Indies failed to progress to the second round after some miserable performances in the first round of tournament. Despite that, Hooper was retained in the side but this time, he pulled himself back and finally retired from the game as he wanted a youngster in the team instead of him.\n\nHooper has lived in Australia since the late 1990s.\nHooper completed level 3 coaching accreditation with Cricket Australia in 2010.\nHooper has been appointed as batting coach of the Sagicor High Performance Centre to groom the talent pool of young West Indian batsmen.<ref>\n"}

Journalist Fernando González Gortázar lists Zúñiga as one of the 100 most notable Mexicans of the 20th century, while the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" calls him \"perhaps the best sculptor\" of the Mexican political modern style.\n\nZúñiga was born in Guadalupe, Barrio de San José, Costa Rica on December 27, 1912 to Manuel Maria Zúñiga and María Chavarría, both sculptors. His father worked as a sculptor of religious figures, and in stone work. His artistic inclinations began early and by the age of twelve had already read books on the history of art, artistic anatomy and the life of various Renaissance painters. At age fifteen he began working in his father’s shop. This experience sensitized him to shape and spaces. In 1926 he enrolled in the Escuela de Bellas Artes in Mexico, but left the following year to continue on his own. As part of his self-study, he studied German Expressionism and the writings of Alexander Heilmayer, through which he learned of the work of two French sculptors, Aristide Maillol and Auguste Rodin, coming to appreciate the idea of subordinating technique to expression.\n\nZúñiga’s painting and sculpting work began receiving recognition in 1929. His first stone sculpture won second prize at the Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes. In the following two years continued to win top prizes at this event. This work made critics recommend him for study abroad. He won first prize in a 1935 Latin American sculpture competition, the Salón de Escultura en Costa Rica, for his stone sculpture \"La maternidad\", but the work caused controversy and the government rescinded its award. In the 1930s, he began to research pre Hispanic art and its importance to contemporary Latin American art, as well as what was happening artistically in Mexico. The scholarship never materialized so various colleagues organized his first individual exhibition in Costa Rica. The earnings from this endeavor earned his passage to Mexico City. In 1936 he immigrated to Mexico permanently.\n\nIn the capital, his first contact with Manuel Rodríguez Lozano, who opened his library to Zúñiga. He did some formal study at La Escuela de Talla Directa, working with Guillermo Ruiz, sculptor Oliverio Martinez, and painter Rodríguez Lozano. In 1937 he worked as an assistant to Oliverio Martínez on the Monument to the Revolution, the re-imagined building that had begun as the Federal Legislative Palace conceived during the regime of Porfirio Díaz. In 1938, he took a faculty position at La Esmeralda; he remained at that position until retiring in 1970. In 1958 he was awarded the first prize in sculpture from the Mexican National Institute of Fine Arts.\n\nIn the 1940s, the New York Museum of Modern Art acquired the sculpture Cabeza de niño totonaca and the Metropolitan Museum of Art requested two of his drawings. He also helped to found the Sociedad Mexicana de Escultores and received commissions in various parts of Mexico.\n\nIn 1947, he married Elena Laborde, a painting student. They had three children, Ariel, Javier and Marcela.\n\nIn 1949, he was part of the founding board of the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana, and in 1951, he joined the Frente Nacional de Artes Plástica of Francisco Goitia .\n\nMajor individual exhibitions during his career include the Bernard Lewin Gallery in Los Angeles in 1965, a retrospective at the Museo de Arte Moderno in 1969 and various exhibitions in Europe in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1971, he received the Acquisition Prize at the 1971 Biennial of Open Air Sculpture of Middelheim in Antwerp, Belgium. In 1975 twenty of his drawings with the Misrachi Gallery obtained the silver medal at the International Book Exposition of Leipzig. In the 1980s, he was named an Academic of the Accademia delle Arte e del Lavoro in Parma, Italy. In Mexico he won the Elías Sourasky Prize.\n\nIn 1984 he won the first Kataro Takamura Prize of the Third Biennial of Sculpture in Japan.\n\nHe became a Mexican citizen in 1986, fifty years after his arrival in the country.\n\nIn 1992 he received the Premio Nacional de Arte, and in 1994, the Palacio de Bellas Artes held a tribute to his career.\n\nNear the end of his life, illness left him nearly blind, which caused him to shift his artistic work to terra cotta, using his hands to create the lines.\n\nZúñiga created over thirty five public sculptures, such as the monument to poet Ramón López Velarde in the city of Zacatecas and others dedicated to Mexican heroes. In the 1940s he created two sculpture for Chapultepec Park, Muchachas corriendo and Física nuclear. In 1984 he created a group of sculptures called Tres generaciones for the city of Sendai, Japan. During his lifetime, these were considered his most important works. Since then, they have become secondary to his other sculpting.\n\nHe stated that he preferred figurative art because he found the human figure to be “the most important aspect of the world around (him)”. He was also strongly influenced by pre Hispanic art, spending significant time sketching pieces in museums, along with images of women in traditional markets, feeling that they represented maternity and familial responsibility.\n\nMuseums holding his works in their permanent collections include the San Diego Museum of Art, the New Mexico Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Phoenix Art Museum, the Ponce Museum of Art in Puerto Rico, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\n"}

His work helped shape the careers of many actors, directors and screenwriters, though his reviews, at times, were perceived as unnecessarily mean. Crowther was an advocate of foreign-language films in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly those of Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica, Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini.\n\nCrowther was born Francis Bosley Crowther Jr. in Lutherville, Maryland, the son of Eliza Hay (née Leisenring, 1877–1960) and Francis Bosley Crowther (1874–1950). As a child, Crowther moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where he published a neighborhood newspaper, \"The Evening Star\". His family moved to Washington, D.C., and Crowther graduated from Western High School in 1922. After two years of prep school at Woodberry Forest School, he entered Princeton University, where he majored in history. For his writing, Crowther was offered a job as a cub reporter for \"The New York Times\" at a salary of $30 per week. He declined the offer, made to him by the publisher Adolph S. Ochs, hoping to find employment on a small Southern newspaper. When the salary offered by those papers wasn't half of the \"Times\" offer, he went to New York and took the job. He was the first night cub reporter for the \"Times\", and in 1933 was asked by Brooks Atkinson to join the drama department. He spent five years covering the theater scene in New York, and even dabbled in writing for it.\n\nWhile at the \"Times\" in those early years, Crowther met Florence Marks, a fellow employee; the couple married on January 20, 1933. They had three sons, Bosley Crowther III, an attorney; John M. Crowther, a writer and artist; and Jefferson, a banker and the father of Welles Remy Crowther.\n\nCrowther was a prolific writer of film essays as a critic for \"The New York Times\" from 1940 to 1967. Perhaps conscious of the power of his reviews, \"New York Times\" obituarist Robert D. McFadden considered his tone to be \"scholarly rather than breezy\". Frank Beaver wrote in \"Bosley Crowther: Social Critic of the Film, 1940–1967\" that Crowther opposed displays of patriotism in films and believed that a movie producer \"should balance his political attitudes even in the uncertain times of the 1940s and 1950s, during the House Un-American Activities Committee\". Crowther's review of the wartime drama \"Mission to Moscow\" (1943), made during the period when the Soviet Union was one of the Allied Powers with the United States, chided the film by saying it should show \"less ecstasy\", and wrote \"It is just as ridiculous to pretend that Russia has been a paradise of purity as it is to say the same thing about ourselves\".\n\nIn the 1950s, Crowther was an opponent of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, whose anti-Communist crusade targeted the State Department, the administration of Harry S. Truman, the U.S. Army, and individual government employees. He opposed censorship of movies, and advocated greater social responsibility in the making of movies. Crowther approved of movies with social content, such as \"Gone With the Wind\" (1939), \"The Grapes of Wrath\" (1940), \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), \"The Lost Weekend\" (1945), \"All the King's Men\" (1949) and \"High Noon\" (1952).\n\nCrowther barely concealed his disdain for Joan Crawford when reviewing her films, referring to her acting style in \"Female on the Beach\" (1955) as \"artificiality\" and \"pretentiousness,\" and also chided Crawford for her physical bearing. In his review of the Nicholas Ray film \"Johnny Guitar\" (1954), Crowther complained that \"no more femininity comes from (Crawford) than from the rugged Mr. Heflin in \"Shane\" (1953). For the lady, as usual, is as sexless as the lions on the public library steps and as sharp and romantically forbidding as a package of unwrapped razor blades\".\n\nHis preferences in popular movies were not always predictable. He defended epics such as \"Ben-Hur\" (1959) and \"Cleopatra\" (1963), but gave the World War II film \"The Great Escape\" (also 1963) a highly unfavorable review, and panned David Lean's later works. He called \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) a \"thundering camel-opera that tends to run down rather badly as it rolls on into its third hour and gets involved with sullen disillusion and political deceit.\"\n\nCrowther often admired foreign-language films, especially the works of Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica, Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini. However he was critical of some iconic releases as well. He found Kurosawa's classic \"Throne of Blood\" (1957, but not released in the U.S. until 1961), derived from \"Macbeth\", ludicrous, particularly its ending; and called \"Gojira (Godzilla)\" (1954) \"an incredibly awful film\". Crowther dismissed Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho\" (1960) as \"a blot on an otherwise honorable career\". He soon reassessed the film, considering it one of the top ten movies of the year, writing that \"Psycho\" was a \"bold psychological mystery picture... [I]t represented expert and sophisticated command of emotional development with cinematic techniques.\" He commented that while Satyajit Ray's \"Pather Panchali\" (1955, US: 1958) took on \"a slim poetic form\" the structure and tempo of it \"would barely pass as a 'rough cut' with editors in Hollywood\". Writing about \"L'Avventura\" (1960), Crowther said that watching the film was \"like trying to follow a showing of a picture at which several reels have got lost.\"\n\nThe career of Bosley Crowther is discussed at length in \"\", including his support for foreign-language cinema and his public repudiation of McCarthyism and the Blacklist. In this 2009 documentary film, contemporary critics who appreciate his work, such as A.O. Scott, appear, but also those who found his work to be too moralistic, such as Richard Schickel, Molly Haskell and Andrew Sarris. \n\nThe end of Crowther's career was marked by his disdain for the 1967 film \"Bonnie and Clyde\". He was critical of what he saw as the film's sensationalized violence. His review was negative:\n\nOther critics besides Crowther panned the movie. John Simon, the critic of \"New York\" magazine, while praising its technical execution, declared \"Slop is slop, even served with a silver ladle.\" Its distributor pulled the film from circulation. However, the critical consensus on \"Bonnie and Clyde\" reversed, exemplified by two high-profile reassessments by \"Time\" and \"Newsweek\". The latter's Joe Morgenstern wrote two reviews in consecutive issues, the second retracting and apologizing for the first. \"Time\" hired Stefan Kanfer as its new film critic in late 1967; his first assignment was an ostentatious rebuttal of his magazine's original negative review. A rave in \"The New Yorker\" by Pauline Kael was also influential.\n\nEven in the wake of this critical reversal, however, Bosley Crowther remained one of the film's most dogged critics. He eventually wrote three negative reviews and periodically blasted the movie in reviews of other films and in a letters column response to unhappy \"Times\" readers. \"The New York Times\" replaced Crowther as its primary film critic in early 1968, and some observers speculated that his persistent attacks on \"Bonnie and Clyde\" had shown him to be out of touch with current cinema and weighed heavily in his removal. Crowther worked as an executive consultant at Columbia Pictures after leaving the \"Times\".\n\nCrowther wrote \"The Lion's Share: The Story of an Entertainment Empire\" (1957), the first book documenting the history of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and \"Hollywood Rajah: The Life and Times of Louis B. Mayer\" (1960), a biography of MGM's studio's head.\n\nCrowther died of heart failure on March 7, 1981 at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, New York. He was survived by his wife Florence, who died in 1984; a sister, Nancy Crowther Kappes; three sons, F. Bosley, John, and Jefferson; and four grandchildren.\n\n\n"}

It provides career, college preparation, and technical education to students from grades 7-12 and is a member of the Coalition of Essential Schools.\n\nThe six specialties of the school are music, visual arts, theatre arts, creative writing, math and science, and dance. The largest of these is math and science with an enrollment of around 100 students, with the other departments being smaller portions of the student body.\n\nThe school began in 1968 with a group of Birmingham arts community leaders, James Hatcher and Peggy Beddow Cook, who acquired funding from Governor Lurleen Wallace to support instructional programs based in community arts agencies after school. The Alabama Legislature formally created the school with a resolution in 1971. The school was located at Samford University, with the dance program being located at UAB, but moved to Birmingham–Southern College in 1974. While there it was consolidated into five arts programs and a core academic program, staffed in part by the Birmingham City Schools.\n\nThe school moved to its own temporary downtown Birmingham campus in 1976. At this time the private, non-profit Alabama School of Fine Arts Foundation was established to raise funding to build an all-new campus complex.\n\nA new law was approved by the Legislature in 1992 to provide for authorization for the school. The school moved into its new $10 million facility in the heart of Birmingham’s cultural district the following year. A theater was added to the campus in 1995, followed by a mathematics and science wing in 1996. A creative writing wing was added in 1999. The ASFA Foundation began a new capital campaign in 2006 to raise money for the construction of a new theatre complex. The fundraising took many years, with construction lasting 17 months and costing $8.5 million. The new 500-seat theater, named in honor of Dorothy Jemison Day, was opened on March 30, 2012 with an ASFA theatre department production of Thornton Wilder's \"Our Town\".\n\nThe ASFA theatre department was named as one of the nation's outstanding high school theatre programs by \"Stage Directions\" magazine in 2011.\n\nAdmission into the school is competitive. Prospective students must submit an application with test scores, transcripts, essays, and three letters of recommendation. Selected students then audition for their chosen department. For the arts departments, audition is through performance, portfolios, and interview. For the math and science department, audition is through interview and two rounds of testing.\n\nWith the school funded by the Alabama Legislature, in-state students pay no tuition. Students from outside the state are charged tuition.\n\n\n"}

He is the author of \"I am Keith Mann I Cured Cancer at home\" (2018) and \"From Dusk 'til Dawn\" (2007), and acted as a spokesman for the ALF.\n\nIn 1994, Mann was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment as the result of a 1991 arrest for conspiracy to set meat lorries on fire. After an escape from custody, he was found by police working in an animal sanctuary run by the Celia Hammond Animal Trust, which had employed him unaware of who he was.\n\nHe has since turned his attention to mainstream politics, and stood unsuccessfully for parliament in the Oxford West and Abingdon constituency for the Animal Protection Party in the May 2010 general election.\n\nMann was raised in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, by his father, who worked as a caretaker, and his mother, Doreen, whom he describes as having done \"everything else\".\n\nHe writes in \"From Dusk 'Til Dawn\" that his lasting memory of his first job, on a dairy farm, is the cows crying out all day searching for the calves that had been removed from them. He first came into contact with animal rights activists in 1982, when local hunt saboteurs were handing out leaflets in the street. His first removal of an animal from captivity was when he took a rabbit from a hutch that he used to walk past every day, after having asked the owner for weeks to do something about the rabbit's situation. He writes that this incident changed his view of theft forever, and that he thereafter viewed himself as a \"proud ALF activist.\" His next removal was of a tub of goldfish from a fairground, resulting in him having 53 goldfish in his bath for weeks until he found good ponds for them.\n\nMann was first arrested on 15 October 1991 after being accused of planning to set a number of meat lorries on fire, to protest the treatment of chickens in factory farms.\n\nOn 13 December 2003 Mann and another activist who remains unidentified entered Wickham Laboratories and removed 695 mice being used to test botulinum toxin, sold commercially as Botox and Dysport. He was arrested at his home and the mice were returned to the laboratory. He argued that the tests were illegal because the product was being tested for cosmetic purposes, which is banned in Britain. The Southern Animal Rights Coalition also received paperwork which they say demonstrates cosmetic Botox was being tested on animals. A court rejected Mann's defence, ruling that the tests were in compliance with UK regulations, because Botox is also used for therapeutic purposes to prevent muscle spasm. In April 2005 he was found guilty of burglary and given 230 hours community service. On leaving the court, he threatened a director of the company, telling him: \"Your trouble has only just started, you will need to look under your bed\", which led to a charge of contempt of court and six months in custody, which he served in Winchester Prison.\n\nIn 2007 Mann was involved in \"Gateway to Hell\", a campaign aimed at airports, ports and freight firms importing animals for experimentation. The National Extremism Tactical Co-ordination Unit believed the group was linked to Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC), an international campaign to close down Huntingdon Life Sciences, a contract animal-testing facility. The homes of five air transport executives were attacked within days of the Gateway campaign beginning. Mann said, \"Once we have stopped the airports, which we will do before too long, it is going to be difficult for them to find other ways of bringing animals in.\"\n\nMann's first book was published in May 2007. \"From Dusk 'til Dawn\", with a foreword by British poet Benjamin Zephaniah an endorsement by singer Morrissey and featuring Britches on its cover, offers a behind-the-scenes account of the animal liberation movement.\n\nMann's second book was published in November 2018. \"I am Keith Mann I Cured Cancer at home\" this documents his journey curing an incurable stage 4 cancer and discovering its cause. Keith tested positive for simian virus 40 (SV40). \"Millions of people worldwide were inadvertently exposed to live simian virus 40 (SV40) between 1955 and 1963 through immunization with SV40-contaminated polio vaccines.\" Some studies have found a significant association between SV40 and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nIn January 2008 SPEAK Political—since renamed The Animal Protection Party— announced that Mann would stand as an electoral candidate. Mann stood in Oxford West and Abingdon against Liberal Democrat MP Evan Harris in the 2010 general election. The area was the focus of protests due to the establishment of Oxford University's Biomedical Sciences Building.

It is about a Czechoslovak Army officer who is captured in the Fall of France and spends five years as a prisoner of war, during which time he forms a long-distance relationship with the widow of a British Army officer. The film was entered into the 1946 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe film is partly based on the true story of a Czechoslovak officer in the RAF Volunteer Reserve, Josef Bryks MBE, and his relationship with a British WAAF, Gertrude Dellar, who was the widow of an RAF pilot.\n\nIn the summer of 1940, Captain Karel Hašek of the Czechoslovak Army escapes from Dachau concentration camp and assumes the identity of a dead British officer, Captain Geoffrey Mitchell. When he is caught, he joins thousands of British prisoners of war, captured during the Fall of France, on a march to a prison camp in western Germany.\n\nHe is suspected of being a spy by his fellow soldiers because of a few small errors and his fluency in the German language. Captain Grayson wants to lynch him forthwith, but Major Dalrymple, the senior British officer, hears Hašek out and believes his story. \n\nTo avoid suspicion, he has to maintain the fiction that Mitchell is still alive by corresponding with Mitchell's widow Celia. Prior to the war, Mitchell had abandoned his wife and their two children, but the letters rekindle Celia's love.\n\nAfter their escape tunnel is discovered, the prisoners resign themselves to a long stay. In 1944, when Herr Forster, who ran Dachau during Hašek's stay, visits the camp, Hašek fears he may be unmasked. The official compliments him on his nearly perfect German and seems to recognise him, but cannot quite place him. Hašek is sure time is running out; it is announced that some prisoners are to be repatriated, but when he goes for his medical examination to see if he qualifies, he is turned away.\n\nA plan to save him is devised without his knowledge. Private Mathews, a burglar in civilian life, breaks into the Kommandant's office late at night with two other men. They find the list of those to be repatriated and replace Mathews's own name with Mitchell's. On the way back to the barracks, Mathews is attacked by a guard dog and rescued by Hašek. The plan works, and Hašek is \"returned\" to Britain.\n\nHe goes to see Celia. He breaks the news of her husband's death and that he has grown to love her. She is devastated, and Hašek leaves. After she recovers, she begins rereading his letters and realises that she has come to love the writer. When Hašek calls her on the telephone on the day that Germany surrenders, she is eager to speak with him.\n\nMany of the prisoners were played by serving soldiers.\n\nLocations included the ex-naval prisoner of war camp Marlag, near Westertimke, which had remained largely intact after the end of the war the previous year, and Aston Rowant railway station.\nAccording to trade papers, the film was a \"notable box office attraction\" at the British box office in 1946. Another source says it was the fourth biggest hit at the British box office in 1946 after \"The Wicked Lady\", \"The Bells of St Marys\" and \"Piccadilly Incident\".\n\n"}

He learned to be a farrier, as well as a blacksmith. He was also taught clock making at the village of Kostelec nad Vltavou (in central Bohemia). He was taught by local master blacksmith J. Kunike. He lived with the Kunike family in their house of which still stands together with the outbuilding and yard which was used as a smithy. In 1927 the school records show that he attended school in business studies at village Kovářov near to Kostelec nad Vltavou. The building which housed the school is today the municipal office. (A marble plaque was erected in 2010, together with historical documents on the wall there – these documents were all placed there by the citizens of Kovářov.)\n\nIn 1937, he began work at a military chemical plant in Žilina; after an accident, however, he was transferred to the gas storage facility (which belonged to Czechoslovak army) in Trenčín. \n\nThe breakup of the Czechoslovak Republic and the subsequent emergence (on 14 March 1939) of the clero-fascist and anti-Czech Slovak State he didn't accept – when German \"Wehrmacht\" took over the military depot and sabotaged it. To escape punishment, he fled to Poland (on 6 June 1939) and joined forming Czechoslovak military unit in Polish service (Czechoslovak Legion). Then, with other comrades, was transferred via ship to France and there entered the 1st Regiment of the Foreign Legion. In 26 September 1939 he was drafted in Agde into the emerging Czechoslovak foreign army in France and included as deputy commander of the machine gun platoon at the 1st Infantry Regiment of the 1st Czechoslovak Infantry Division in France (\"1 division d'infanterie tchécoslovaque en France\"). Three months later, he was promoted to the rank of \"četař\" (sergeant) and participated in the Battle of France during the Spring of 1940. \n\nFollowing France's surrender, together with remnants of Czechoslovak troops, he evacuated (12 July 1940) to Great Britain where he was trained as a paratrooper. He became a \"rotmistr\" (approx. UK staff sergeant) in rank. The Free Czechoslovaks, as he and other self-exiled Czechoslovaks were called, were stationed at Cholmondeley Castle near Malpas in Cheshire.\n\nJozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš were airlifted along with seven soldiers from Czechoslovak army-in-exile in the United Kingdom and two other groups named \"Silver A\" and \"Silver B\" (who had different missions) by a Royal Air Force Halifax of No. 138 Squadron into Czechoslovakia at 10 pm on 28 December 1941. In Prague, they contacted several families and anti-Nazi organisations who helped them during the preparations for the assassination.\n\nOn 27 May 1942, at 10:30 am, Heydrich proceeded on his daily commute from his home in Panenské Břežany to Prague Castle. Gabčík and Kubiš waited at the tram stop on the curve near Bulovka Hospital in Prague 8-Libeň. As Heydrich's open-topped Mercedes-Benz neared the pair, Gabčík, who concealed his Sten gun under a raincoat, dropped the raincoat and raised the gun, and, at close range, tried to shoot Heydrich, but the gun jammed. Heydrich ordered his driver, SS-Oberscharführer Klein, to stop the car. As the car braked in front of him, Kubiš threw a modified anti-tank grenade (concealed in a briefcase) at the vehicle; he misjudged his throw. Instead of landing inside the Mercedes, it landed against the rear wheel. Nonetheless, the bomb severely wounded Heydrich when it detonated, its fragments ripping through the right rear fender and embedding shrapnel from the upholstery of the car into Heydrich, causing serious injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen and lung, as well as a fractured rib. Kubiš received a minor wound to his face from the sharpnel. Heydrich and Klein leapt out of the shattered limousine with drawn pistols; Klein ran towards Kubiš, who had staggered against the railings, while Heydrich went to Gabčík who stood paralyzed, holding the sten. Kubiš recovered and, jumped on his bicycle and pedaled away, scattering passengers spilling from the tram, by firing in the air with his Colt M1903 pistol. Klein tried to shoot at him but dazed by the explosion, pressed the magazine release catch and the gun jammed. A staggering Heydrich came towards Gabčík, who dropped his sten and tried to reach his bicycle. He was forced to abandon this attempt, however and took cover behind a telegraph pole, firing at Heydrich with his pistol. Heydrich returned fire and ducked behind the stalled tram. Suddenly, Heydrich doubled over and staggered to the side of the road in pain. He then collapsed against the railings, holding himself up with one hand. As Gabčík took the opportunity to run, Klein returned from his fruitless chase of Kubiš to help his wounded superior. Heydrich, his face pale and contorted in pain, pointed out the fleeing Czech, saying \"Get that bastard!\". As Klein gave pursuit, Heydrich stumbled along the pavement before collapsing against the bonnet of his wrecked car. Gabčík fled into a butcher shop, where the owner, a man named Brauer, who was a Nazi sympathiser and had a brother who worked for the Gestapo, ignored Gabčík's request for help, and ran out into the roadway, attracting Klein's attention by shouting and pointing. Klein, whose gun was still jammed, ran into the shop and collided with Gabčík in the doorway. In the confusion, Gabčík shot him twice, severely wounding him in the leg. Gabčík then escaped in a tram, reaching a local safe house. The assassins were initially convinced that the attack had failed. Heydrich was rushed to Bulovka Hospital, where it was discovered that he was suffering from blood poisoning. There, Heydrich died on the morning of 4 June 1942. \n\nA rigorous investigation of the assassination determined that it was planned and executed by the Czech Resistance with assistance of the British. The oppression and persecution of the defiant Czechs reached its peak following the failure of Nazi soldiers to capture the assassins alive. More than 13,000 people were ultimately arrested and tortured, including the girlfriend of Jan Kubiš, Anna Malinová, who died at Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. First Lieutenant Adolf Opálka's aunt, Marie Opálková, was executed in Mauthausen on 24 October 1942. His father, Viktor Jarolím, was also killed. Among the unfortunate was the native of Kostelec nad Vltavou, JUDr. Jan Fleischmann. It was known locally that Jozef visited Jan Fleischmann who was a friend in Kostelec nad Vltavou before the assassination of Heydrich. After the assassination, the visit was found out as Karel Čurda had informed Gestapo and the Nazis arrested Jan Fleischmann and took him to Pankrác where he was tortured and finally executed.\n\nThe Nazi officials in the Protectorate carried out an extensive search for the two men. Eventually, the Germans found them, along with other paratroopers, hiding in Cyril and Methodius Cathedral in Prague. After a six-hour gun battle, in which the Germans lost 14 and sustained wounds to 21 others, Gabčík and the others, with the exception of Kubiš, who was seriously wounded by a grenade, committed suicide before the Nazis could take them alive in the church catacombs. Kubiš was wounded in the gun battle and died shortly after arrival at the hospital.\n\nThe town of Gabčíkovo in southern Slovakia is named after Gabčík, and one of the biggest dams on the Danube next to the village is named after the town. Jozef Gabčík's name was also given to the \"5. pluk špeciálneho určenia\" (\"5th special operations regiment of Jozef Gabčík\") part of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic, based in Žilina.\n\nWith the aim of commemorating the heroes of the Czech and Slovak Resistance, the Slovak National Museum in May 2007 opened an exhibition presenting one of the most important resistance actions in the whole Nazi-occupied Europe.\n\nCoinciding with the release of the 2016 film \"Anthropoid\", campaigners called for Gabčík's and Kubiš's bodies to be exhumed from the mass-grave at the cemetery in Ďáblice, northern Prague, and to be given a dignified burial fitting \"the heroes of anti-Nazi resistance\".\n\nGabčík is portrayed in four films which describe (more or less accurately) the assassination of Heydrich:\n\n"}

She has 20 wins on the LPGA Tour, including two major championships, and over $19 million in career earnings. Kerr was the number one-ranked golfer in the Women's World Golf Rankings for three time periods in 2010. She is naturally left handed but plays golf right handed.\n\nKerr was born in Miami, Florida, and started playing golf at the age of eight. She had a successful amateur career, winning the 1994 Junior Orange Bowl International Golf Championship and the 1995 Women's Western Amateur. She was the 1995 American Junior Golf Association Junior Player of the Year. In 1996 she played in the Curtis Cup and was the low amateur at the U.S. Women's Open. She graduated from Miami Sunset High School in West Kendall, Florida.\n\nKerr's first win in a professional tournament came in April 1995 in the Ironwood FUTURES Classic on the Futures Tour, which she played while still an amateur.\n\nShe turned professional in 1996 at age 18 after graduating from high school, playing on both the Futures Tour and Players West Tour. In October 1996, she tied for sixth at the LPGA Final Qualifying Tournament to gain exempt status for 1997. Her LPGA career started fairly slowly; she broke into the top fifty on the money list in her third season in 1999, but did not win until her sixth season. In 2002, she won her first LPGA event at the Longs Drugs Challenge in California. By 2004, she was one of the leading players on the tour, with three tournament victories, and a fifth-place finish on the money list. She won two tournaments in 2005 and moved up to third on the money list. She tied for second at the 2000 U.S. Women's Open, matched by her performance in the 2006 Women's British Open. Her first win of 2006 came at the Franklin American Mortgage Championship where she posted a tournament-record score of 19 under par. In 2006, she was the only American to win more than one event on the LPGA Tour, winning three times. She won the 2007 U.S. Women's Open, her first major championship. She was also a member of the United States Solheim Cup team in 2002, 2003, and 2005.\nThe hallmarks of Kerr's game are putting; she finished in the top five on the LPGA Tour in putts/greens hit in 2005 and 2006 and iron play. She was fifth in greens-in-regulation in 2005. In 2005, Kerr finished in the top 10 in half of the tournaments she entered, and ranked second in the LPGA in scoring average, trailing only Annika Sörenstam.\n\nIn 2010, Kerr won two of the first 10 tournaments on the LPGA Tour, including the LPGA Championship, which she won by a record-breaking 12-stroke margin over the second-place finisher Song-Hee Kim. As a result of this finish, she went to the top of the Women's World Golf Rankings on June 28, 2010. Kerr held the position for three weeks before Ai Miyazato again regained the top ranking by a margin of 0.0006 average points.\n\nIn 2015, Kerr won the CME Group Tour Championship by one shot over fellow American Gerina Piller and South Korean Jang Ha-na. That year she made 24 cuts out of 25 events, captured her 17th career victory at the Kia Classic and posted a 3–0–1 record at her eight Solheim Cup, helping the U.S. team to victory.\n\nIn 2016, she recorded four top-10 finishes, including a tie for seventh at the LPGA KEB Hana Bank Championship. She was also on the victorious U.S. team at the UL International Crown, where she posted a team-best 3–1–0 record. In 2017, Kerr recorded her 19th and 20th career wins, moving her into a tie with Laura Davies for 26th all-time on the LPGA career wins list. That year she also participated in her ninth Solheim Cup for the U.S., posting a 3–0–1 record, thereby surpassing Juli Inkster for the all-time lead in points recorded by a U.S. player in Solheim Cup history (21). In 2018, Kerr recorded two top-10 finishes, with a season-best finish tied for second at the Kia Classic\n\nKerr is actively involved in fundraising for breast cancer research.\n\nThe LPGA and the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation awarded Kerr the 2006 LPGA Komen Award due to her dedication to find a cure for breast cancer through the foundation that she founded called \"Birdies for Breast Cancer\". Kerr donates $50 per birdie. As of August 2009, she has raised over $750,000 through donations and an annual charity event. Kerr created the foundation in honor of her mother, Linda, who has been her inspiration. The foundation was created in 2003, the year that her mother Linda was diagnosed with breast cancer. Kerr also founded Curvature Wines, which helps to raise money for breast cancer charities. All Trump resorts carry the 2006 cabernet sauvignon under the Curvature Wines label. \n\nKerr is in height. In 1999, she weighed , a weight that caused her to have back spasms. Her parents, who are divorced, are both diabetics, and her mother had a heart attack when Kerr was in the ninth grade. After her weight peaked, Kerr began exercising regularly and went on a diet. By 2002, she had lost , and weighs .\n\nKerr made an appearance on an episode of the third season of Donald Trump's television series \"The Apprentice\" in 2005. In 2006, Kerr married businessman Erik Stevens. Kerr and Stevens maintain a residence in Scottsdale, Arizona. One of her sponsors is Mutual of Omaha, which donates money to her breast cancer research foundation every time she places third or better.\n\nKerr partnered with Pride Mountain Vineyards in Napa, California, to launch her Curvature wine label with the 2006 vintage. She has also launched a new wine venture, Kerr Cellars, with winemaker Helen Keplinger, beginning with a 2013 vintage. The label now produces Pinot noir and red and white Bordeaux blends.

{"id": "2112227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112227", "title": "County of Bentheim", "text": "County of Bentheim\n\nThe County of Bentheim (\"Grafschaft Bentheim\", Low German \"Benthem\") was a state of the Holy Roman Empire, located in the south-west corner of today's Lower Saxony, Germany. The county's borders corresponded largely to those of the modern administrative district (\"Landkreis\") of Grafschaft Bentheim.\n\nGeographically, Bentheim is composed largely of fenland, and early settlement was concentrated along the banks of the rivers which pass through the county. Deposits of Bentheim sandstone formed the basis of a profitable export trade to other parts of present-day Germany and the Netherlands.\n\nAround 500–600 CE Germanic tribes settled in the area. The Saxon tribes lost their independence in 804 CE after the Franks won the Saxon Wars. Between 800 and 850 Emperor Charlemagne had them forced to convert to Christianity. The scholten system was introduced, and Emlichheim, Uelsen, Veldhausen, and Nordhorn become church and court districts.\n\nThe county of Bentheim was in existence by c. 1050 AD, although little is known of its history before 1115. In that year, the county passed to Count Otto, of the House of Salm. His heir and daughter, Countess Sophia, married Dirk VI, Count of Holland, and they co-ruled the county until Dirk's death in 1157. Sophia died in 1176, and the title of count passed to her son Otto I. In 1263, Bentheim annexed the County of Tecklenburg, and over time various branches of the counts of Bentheim would annex and purchase various territories in Rheda, Steinfurt, and the Netherlands. In 1277, the County of Bentheim was partitioned into Bentheim-Bentheim (containing the County of Bentheim) and Bentheim-Tecklenburg (containing the County of Tecklenburg).\n\nThe first County of Bentheim-Bentheim endured until 1530, when its line of counts had become extinct and Bentheim was granted to Arnold II of Bentheim-Steinfurt. In 1544, Arnold officially converted to Lutheranism, beginning a slow process of introducing the Reformation in Bentheim and other territories he ruled. Protestant preachers were introduced into Bentheim during the autumn of 1587. The following year Bentheim officially gained a new Church constitution, which was later introduced in Tecklenburg (1589) and Steinfurt (1591). In 1613, Count Arnold Jobst of Bentheim-Steinfurt created the Higher Church Council to help administer the spiritual matters of Bentheim, as well as establishing the Reformed Church of Bentheim in all three of the counties.\n\nWhen Arnold Jobst died in 1643, the County of Bentheim-Steinfurt was partitioned into Bentheim-Steinfurt and Bentheim-Bentheim, the latter comprising the County of Bentheim. In 1753, the County of Bentheim was seized by the elector of Hanover. \"In 1753, trouble within made them (the Counts of Bentheim) take out a mortgage to the King of Hanover and England.\"\n\nFor almost 700 years prior to this, Grafshaft Bentheim was independently ruled by the Counts of Bentheim and that they might have continued thus had it not been for the circumstances of 1753.\n\nAt the end of the Holy Roman Empire, the Count of Bentheim-Steinfurt and the Count of Bentheim-Bentheim each had one voice in the Assembly of the Imperial Circle of the Lower Rhine-Westphalia. As members of the College of the Counts of Westphalia, they were represented in the Council of Princes of the Imperial Diet (\"Reichstag\"). These representation made the House of Bentheim a member of the German High Nobility.\n\nIn 1803 the Bentheim-Bentheim branch became extinct. In 1804 the Count of Bentheim-Steinfurt made a bargain with the Government of France. He paid a fraction of the old debt of the Count of Bentheim-Bentheim to Hanover and obtained the possession of the County of Bentheim despite the protest of the Elector of Hanover.\n\nIn July 1806, by the Act of the Confederation of the Rhine, the Grand Duchy of Berg mediatised the Imperial immediate Counties of Steinfurt and Bentheim that belonged to the Count of Bentheim-Steinfurt.\nIn 1808, the Grand Duchy of Berg mediatised the Lordship (\"Herrschaft\") of Rheda and the County of Hohenlimburg, the independent possessions of the Count of Bentheim-Tecklenburg.\n\nBentheim was annexed by France in 1810 with the Kingdom of Holland and many northwest German regions.\n\nThe Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) put Steinfurt and Rheda under overlordship of Prussia, and Bentheim under overlordship of Hanover.\nIn 1817, the King of Prussia granted the Counts of Bentheim-Steinfurt and Bentheim-Tecklenburg the title of Prince.\nSince 1854, the Princes of Bentheim-Steinfurt and Bentheim-Tecklenburg were hereditary members of the House of Lords of Prussia. \nToday, the still existing branches of the House of Bentheim are the princes of Bentheim-Steinfurt with their seat at Steinfurt Castle (also still owners of the ancestral seat Burg Bentheim) and the princes of Bentheim-Tecklenburg with their seat at Rheda Castle (also still owners of Hohenlimburg Castle) and the Counts of Bentheim-Tecklenburg-Rheda\n\nAlthough Bentheim is a German county, the dialect spoken, \"plattdeutsch\", or \"low german,\" is heavily influenced by the Dutch language.\n\n\"In spirit,\" writes Harger, \"the people of Bentheim have never lost their independence. They became Hanoverians; they were invaded by Napoleon. Prussia took them over in 1866. They lived under the Kaiser and under Hitler. Through all this they came with good courage. If you ask them today about their identity, they just might tell you, 'Wy bin't Groofschappers' (We are from the County).\"\n\nArranged marriages have been a longstanding tradition in Grafschaft (county) Bentheim. In former times, the parents arranged for their children to marry a distant relative. Weddings lasted three days with each invited guest giving about 100 DM ($50 in 1988) to the newly married couple. The couple signs the marriage contract before the ceremony. The presentation of the dowry and hope chest was part of the ceremony.\n\nUntil the 1950s, most gave birth, with aid of a midwife, in their own home. After birth, the baby would have its lower body tightly wrapped to prevent it becoming bowlegged and a tight fitting cap would be placed on its head, covering the ears, \"so the ears would grow nice and close to the face.\" Children born during the week would be baptized in the Reformed tradition that coming Sunday, attended by the neighbors and midwife to stand as witnesses. In former times, the new mother would not leave the house during the first six weeks after giving birth.\n\nWhen a family member dies, the next-door neighbor is the first to be contacted. He is in charge for the next four days, and instructs the other neighbors as to their duties. He is responsible for contacting the pastor (officiant), the bell ringer, and the gravedigger and making the burial arrangements. The town bell would be sounded one toll for each year the deceased had lived. If the death occurred after 9:00 p.m., this would wait until 9:00 the following morning. The casket builder would then begin his work, and the \"death messengers\" would be dispatched to inform the citizenry of the death with a message akin to \"You are asked to attend the funeral of the departed ____________ at (time and date).\" All in attendance at the funeral would wear unadorned black clothing. From 850 CE to about 1850 CE, burial was done in the churchyard, the idea being that the \"church on earth\" was the closest place to the \"Church Triumphant.\" A grave was family-owned, and could be reused for another family member after 30 years. Napoleon decreed the establishment of cemetery yards outside of the city or village (for sanitary reasons) in 1808, an edict which was resisted in Bentheim, but finally adopted in 1850.\n\nThe funeral was followed by a church service featuring songs about resurrection. The length of the mourning period varied by relationship to the deceased: three years for the spouse, two years for the children, one year for the siblings, and 6 weeks for the next-door neighbor. During this period, unadorned black was to be worn, and this was strictly enforced.\n\n\n\nThe modern Landkreis \"Grafschaft Bentheim\" which covers approximately the same territory takes its name from the former county and continues to use its coat of arms.\n\n"}

The film was directed by Tonino Valerii.\n\nJack Beauregard (Henry Fonda) is an aging gunslinger who wants to retire peacefully to Europe. Three gunmen attempt to ambush him in a barbershop. After he has shot all three in quick succession, the barber's son asks his father if there is anyone in the world faster than Beauregard, to which the barber replies, \"Faster than him? Nobody!\"\n\nBeauregard pauses on his way to watch a down-and-out (Terence Hill) catching fish. He continues on to an old goldmine, only to find his friend Red has just been shot by a gang. He lies there dying. Beauregard asks Red about the whereabouts of a certain \"Nevada\", but Red only manages to disclose Nevada's village before dying.\n\nAt a horse relay station, the down-and-out is asked by three men to deliver a basket to someone inside, who turns out to be Beauregard. The bum talks to Beauregard, revealing his detailed knowledge of Beauregard's feats, then throws the basket outside. A bomb hidden inside explodes. The bum identifies himself as \"Nobody\". He idolizes Beauregard and wants him to end his career in style by taking on all 150 of the Wild Bunch single-handed. The bandits are using a worthless goldmine to launder their stolen gold. Sullivan, the mine owner fronting for them, thinks Beauregard is out to kill him, and is trying to get him first. The leader of the Wild Bunch tells Sullivan not to give away their operation.\n\nAt Nevada's village, Beauregard finds Nobody already there. He reveals that the Nevada Kid, Beauregard's brother, is dead. Again Nobody challenges him to face the Wild Bunch. Again Beauregard declines.\n\nNobody arrives at a town. After showing his skill with a gun, he is hired by Sullivan to kill Beauregard. Instead, he helps Beauregard to do away with Sullivan's men. Then the Wild Bunch ride into town to collect sticks of dynamite, stashing them in their saddlebags. Later, an old man tells Beauregard that he was bought out of a worthless gold mine by his partners Nevada and Red, only to have the mine produce lots of gold afterwards. Beauregard hurries off to the mine and catches Sullivan loading sacks of gold powder. Sullivan offers Beauregard Nevada's share, but Beauregard tells him he could not care less about his brother, and just takes two sacks, as well as $500 to pay for his passage to Europe. He then leaves to catch a train to New Orleans.\n\nA train is being loaded at a station with bars of gold, guarded by soldiers, when Nobody steals the train. Beauregard is waiting down the line when the Wild Bunch charge towards him across a featureless plain. Nobody arrives with the train, but refuses to rescue Beauregard until he \"makes his name in the history books\". Remembering the mirrored conchas on the gang’s dynamite-filled saddlebags, Beauregard aims at them. One by one, they explode, blowing up most of the charging gang until Nobody lets him board the train.\nIn New Orleans, Beauregard and Nobody finally face off in the street, with a photographer on hand and lots of spectators. Nobody is the faster, and Beauregard falls to the ground. A sign is put up reading \"Jack Beauregard 1848–1899 Nobody was faster on the draw”. What's left of the Wild Bunch see it and switch their search to the anonymous Nobody. Later, Nobody walks by the ship (named Sundowner) that was to take Beauregard to Europe. However, it is revealed that Beauregard is in his cabin aboard, writing Nobody an affectionate farewell and leaving him to survive in his own playful and unheroic way.\n\nShooting for \"My Name Is Nobody\" started on April 30, 1973. It was one of the few films related to Sergio Leone where 80% of the outdoor scenes were actually shot in the United States. The film was shot in nine weeks.\n\nFilming took place at Acoma Pueblo, the ghost town of Cabezon, the mission of San Esteban Del Rey in New Mexico and in the chalk dunes at White Sands. Leone predominantly stayed at home for the shoot and went to join the crew for five days in New Orleans. Leone replaced director Tonino Valerii, who was suffering from an ear infection, for one day on the set.\n\nTensions rose on set between cinematographer Armando Nannuzzi and Valerii. Fonda was being told how to pick up money off the ground and was told two different ways to pick up between Valerii and Nannuzzi. Their relationship became more intense, with Nannuzzi eventually leaving the film.\n\nWhen the film began shooting in Spain in Almeria and Guadix, Valerii had a new cinematographer Giuseppe Ruzzolini and Sergio Salvati. Salvati worked as a cameraman uncredited for the sequences of the duel among mirrors and Nobody's meeting with Sullivan in the gambling room. A new problem arose on set when costumes for Henry Fonda vanished, leading to production stopping for nine days. This led to paying a high penalty to keep Fonda for a few days or postpone shooting until he was free again. Leone proposed to Valerii that they either cut 30 or 40 pages from the script or create a second unit to finish the film. Leone offered to take the second unit shots, which Valerii accepted. Claudio Mancini warned Valerii, stating that Leone would take credit for the film when they go back to Rome if he let him shoot anything. Valerii took over scenes involving Henry Fonda and the action sequences in the desert, while Leone directed the saloon scene with Terence Hill showing his gunslinger skills and parts of the sequences in the village festival, and the public urinal scene which was not in the original script.\n\nAssumptions range between how much Leone contributed to the film. Christopher Frayling noted that \"the most likely scenario is that Leone helped out on a duel, then took over second-unit work on 'the battle', and then directed the opening scenes and the carnival section of the film.\" John Landis, who has claimed to be an extra in the film, said that \"We shot for a couple of weeks, among hundreds of extras on horseback, attacking and firing wildly. Fonda and Hill kept us all at bay. [...] Leone directed that battle on horseback.\" Neil Summers who played Squirrel stated that Leone \"directed most of the scenes I was in [...] [Leone] worked slowly and was constantly trying new angles with his camera and new innovative shots with his actors.\" Valerii himself stated that \"scenes filmed by Leone are: Terence Hill getting drunk in the saloon (but not the close-ups of that shattering glasses, I shot those myself; and also the footage of the betting, with Piero Lulli taking the money, is mine); the part of the sequence at the fair which starts from the moment where Nobody steals the apple from the boy, to the episode of the pies thrown at the negroes' faces; the digression in the public urinal, [...] and several close-ups of Nobody who, while Beauregard fights the Wild Bunch, takes note of the body count as if they were points at a game, another addition on the part of Leone, who thought it was a funny idea.\" Screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi confirmed Valerii's comments stating that \"Tonino shot the whole film, absolutely ON HIS OWN\" and that Leone \"organized a second unit crew and shot a couple of sequences, which in my opinion are the weakest in the film: the urinal, stretched in an abnormal way, and the glass contest in the saloon. Nothing else.\" Sergio Donati expanded on this, stating that some photographers were sent over by the press office, and asked Leone, who was on set for a single day, to sit behind camera in a director's pose with Valerii's permission. Donati stated that \"inevitably, from that moment on, everyone, in and outside the movie business started saying \"Yeah, actually the real director of the film was Leone, who saved it from the disaster of an incapable director\". Leone's own discussion following the film's release often contradicted itself.\n\nPrior to its release in Italy, \"My Name Is Nobody\" was released in West Germany and France on December 13 and 14 respectively. Italian audiences got to see it starting 21 December 1973, where it was distributed by Titanus. The film grossed over 3.6 billion lire and was the third highest-grossing film in Italy of the year, behind Salvatore Samperi's \"Malicious\" (5.5 billion lire) and Dino Risi's \"Sessomatto\". In the United States, it was cut to 111 minutes and \"nearly flopped\" according to Italian film historian Roberto Curti.\n\nIn 2015, a novelization of the film by Michael R. Hudson was published in the United States by Raven Head Press as part of a series of adaptations of several of Gastaldi's scripts, including \"The Horrible Dr. Hichcock\" and \"The Case of the Bloody Iris\".\n\nContemporary reviews are positive. \"The New York Times\" gave it a positive review, saying it was \"very entertaining\" and that it \"...is the kind of Western that only an immensely appreciative and witty Italian film maker could make.\"\n\n\n"}

Her internationally acclaimed magnum opus is \"Heren van de Thee\", translated to \"The Tea Lords\". In 1988 Haasse was chosen to interview the Dutch Queen for her 50th birthday after which celebrated Dutch author Adriaan van Dis called Haasse \"the Queen among authors\".\n\nHaasse has the first Dutch digital online museum dedicated to the life and work of an author. The museum was opened in 2008 on her 90th birthday.\n\nHaasse has an asteroid named after her.\n\nHélène Serafia Haasse was born on 2 February 1918 in Batavia (now Jakarta), the capital of the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia). She was the daughter of civil servant and author Willem Hendrik Haasse (1889–1955) and concert pianist Katharina Diehm Winzenhöhler (1893–1983). She had a brother Wim who was born in 1921. The Haasse family was not very religious.\n\nBefore Haasse's first birthday, the family moved from Batavia to Buitenzorg (Bogor), because her mother's health would benefit from the milder climate. In 1920, the family moved to Rotterdam in the Netherlands, where her father got a temporary job at the city hall. In 1922, the family moved back to the Indies to Soerabaja (Surabaya). Here Haasse went to kindergarten and later to a Catholic primary school, because this was the nearest school. When her mother became ill and went to a sanatory in Davos, Haasse was first sent to her maternal grandparents in Heemstede and then her paternal grandparents in Baarn, and she later stayed at a boarding school in Baarn. In 1928, her mother was recovered and all family members moved back to the Indies to Bandoeng (Bandung).\n\nIn 1930, the Haasse family moved again to Buitenzorg, and a year later again to Batavia. Here she went to the secondary school Bataviaas Lyceum, where Haasse became an active member of the literary club Elcee. In 1935, the family visited the Netherlands, after which Haasse became aware of differences between the Dutch and East Indian society. Haasse graduated from the Lyceum in 1938.\n\nHaasse then moved to the Netherlands to study Dutch. She quickly abandoned this plan, and studied Scandinavian language and literature at the University of Amsterdam. In Amsterdam, she joined a student theater group and met her future husband Jan van Lelyveld, who invited her to become an editor for the satirical magazine \"Propria Cures\" in 1940.\n\nAn important segment of her literary work consists of Dutch Indies literature. Her debut \"Oeroeg\" (1948), is set in the Dutch East Indies, where Haasse was born and lived for most of the first 20 years of her life. Even more autobiographical texts and books about her life in the East Indies, includes books such as The East Indies continued to play an important part in her work: \"Krassen op een rots\" (1970) and her last novel \"Sleuteloog\" (2002), which has the same theme as \"Oeroeg\": is a friendship between a Dutch colonial and an Indonesian child possible and can they really understand each other?\n\nThis \"Oeroeg\" was well received and often reprinted, but did experience some controversy due to the critical reception by the older author Tjalie Robinson. The Indo (Eurasian) Tjalie Robinson pointed out why he did not find the characters in the story credible. Moreover, as Tjalie Robinson himself was still living in the Dutch East Indies at that time, hoping for and working towards fraternization between the Dutch and Indonesians his sharp criticism was directed against what he considered the defeatist nature of the book.\n\nThe movie \"Oeroeg\" based on the book premiered in 1993.\n\nHer internationally acclaimed \"Heren van de Thee\" was translated as \"The Tea Lords\" in 2010. It is a colonial historical novel set in the Dutch East Indies of the 19th and 20th century, based on family archives of the heirs and relations of the tea plantation owners featuring in the book.\n\nHer great commercial success and critical acclaim is reflected in the numerous prizes she has been awarded over the years. She has won prizes for both her first novel in 1948 as well as her last novel in 2003. Prestigious awards for her entire oeuvre up to that time include the Constantijn Huygens Prize in 1981 and the P. C. Hooft Award in 1984. Various other prizes include the ‘’Annie Romein Prize’’and the ‘’Dirk Martens Prize’’. She has also won the ‘’Prize of the Public of the NS’’ twice and is the only author who has written the prestigious annual \"Boekenweekgeschenk\" thrice, in 1948, 1959 and 1994 respectively.\n\nHaasse lived in France for many years (1981–1990), and much of her work has been translated into French. The '‘Académie Française’' awarded Haasse the \"Diplôme de médaille Argent\" in 1984. The next year she delivered a presentation on colonial literature at the University of Dakar. She was awarded the \"Officier dans l’Ordre de la Légion d'Honneur\" in 2000.\n\nHaasse received an honorary literary doctorate from the University of Utrecht in 1988 and from the Belgian University of Leuven in 1995. In 1987 she had already been given an honorary membership of the Belgian Royal Literary Academy (Belgische Koninklijke Academie voor Nederlandse Taal- en Letterkunde (KANTL)) in Gent.\n\nThe Chilean Ministry of Education (‘El Ministerio de education de Chile') awarded her a prize for her “universal contribution to culture” in 1996.\n\nIn 1989 the city of Boston awarded her the 'Boston Certificate of Recognition', for her book \"In a Dark Wood Wandering\": “In recognition and appreciation of your outstanding contributions to the City of Boston and its residents.”\n\nIn 1992 Haasse attended the opening of the IKAPI 'International Book Fair' in Jakarta. It was the last time she would visit her birthplace, Java, and the year her Dutch Indies literature masterpiece \"Heren van de Thee\" was published.\n\n\n\n"}

The series premiered on the NBC network on September 30, 2001. The series ran for one season of 13 episodes, finishing its run on March 23, 2002. It focused on the secret lives and private demons of an elite Justice Department crime-fighting unit that confronted the United States' deadliest, most untouchable lawbreakers by going undercover to bust them.\n\nThe screenplays were either solely written or co-written by Salerno. \"James Bond\" composer David Arnold wrote the main title theme and scored the pilot episode. Salerno said the show was a \"very music driven series.\" \"UC: Undercover\" was a production of NBC Studios, in association with Jersey Television, Chasing Time Pictures, Regency Television, and 20th Century Fox Television. The series' short but popular run ended when it was canceled by the network. The show developed a passionate following overseas and continues to run on FX International.\n\nThe unit is headed by authoritative Frank Donovan (Oded Fehr), with undercover agents Jake Shaw (Jon Seda) and Alex Cross (Vera Farmiga), psychological profiler Monica Davis (Bruklin Harris), and young techno-wizard Cody (Jarrad Paul), who runs all of the high-tech surveillance operations.\n\nAs a federal team, the group responds to emergencies all over the country: taking down elite bank robbers, drug kingpins, domestic terrorists, spies, jewel thieves, and corrupt cops. The drama's character-driven storylines emphasize the taut, cat-and-mouse game played by the undercover agents as they attempt to infiltrate the lives of a gallery of criminals, including murderous master thief Jack \"Sonny\" Walker (William Forsythe) and imprisoned drug lord Carlos Cortez (Steven Bauer).\n\nThe series also explores the psychological toll undercover work takes on the agents who play this deadly game of false identities and who commit treachery as a daily profession for the greater good. The team often butts heads with Paul Bloom (Brian Markinson), their obstructive and fiercely ambitious Justice Department boss.\n\n\n\n\"The New York Times\" called it a \"fast paced, good-looking series,\" and \"Variety\" wrote that series lead Oded Fehr is a \"commanding and interesting addition to television.\" \"Variety\" added that \"technical credits are comparable to theatrical quality\" which led the series winning awards for cinematography and sound. The show received a high 7.3 out of 10 from viewers on TV.com. \"USA Today\" Robert Bianco gave it one star and said it was \"pretentious, incoherent and so visually hyper it borders on nauseating.\"\n\n"}

Bangladeshi universities are affiliated with the University Grants Commission, a commission created according to the Presidential Order (P.O. No 10 of 1973) of the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh.\n\nMost universities focus on general studies, mixing together such areas of study as business, engineering and technology. Seven universities have specialized curricula. Two of these are focused on Islamic studies, two on agricultural science, one on healthcare science, one on veterinary medicine, and one on women's studies. A detailed evaluation of all the universities can be found in the Bangladesh University Ranking 2017 report.\n\nBangladesh has 53 public universities to the bulk of higher studies students. These universities are funded by the government while managed as self-governed organizations.\n\nDhaka division is home to thirteen public universities, among which eight are in Dhaka City. There are seven public universities in Chittagong division, five in Khulna division, three in Rajshahi division. Each of Mymensingh Division, Rangpur division, Sylhet division & Barisal division has two.\nas of 2020 the University Grants Commission of Bangladesh has introduce the cluster system for students enrollment. According to this system all public universities in Bangladesh should be sorted in five clusters i.e.\none for agricultural universities; one for science and technology universities, one for engineering universities, one for medical universities and the last one for general studies universities.\n\nThe following are the public universities that operate through a number of colleges all over Bangladesh instead of a localized campus. Both have headquarters in Gazipur.\n\nEstablishment of private universities in Bangladesh was initiated after the institution of the \"Private University Act 1992\". There are 80 such universities that are operational in five out of seven divisions of the country. The University of Comilla was established in 1995.\nAnother 12 universities has been approved by UGC recently but yet to start operation. So the total number of approved private university is now 97 (as of April 2018).\n\nMost of the private universities are in Dhaka Division, totaling 51. All of them have their campuses in Dhaka city, concentrated mostly in the Gulshan, Dhanmondi, Panthapath and Uttara regions of the city. Two private universities in Dhaka specialize in science and technology, one specializes in women's studies, and the others are general universities. Six private universities are located in Chittagong Division. All six have their main campuses in Chittagong city. International Islamic University, Chittagong has its urban campus in Kumira, outside the main city. Five of them are general universities, while one specializes in science and technology. The only private university in Rajshahi Division has its campus in Bogra. In Sylhet Division there are four private universities, all having their main campuses in Sylhet city. There is no private university in Barisal Division and Rangpur Division.\n\nThere are only two international universities in Bangladesh. They are neither managed nor funded by the government, like public universities, nor established under the Private University Act and managed by a private governing body, like private universities.\nInternational Culture University, established by civil society organization and branded by United Nations Academic Impact (UNAI) and United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), is an internationally accredited-affiliated and an active partner of different international organizations working for internationalization of education and international quality. Islamic University of Technology was established by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and is located in Gazipur, Dhaka division, while another is located in Chittagong division and funded by the Asian University for Women Support Foundation (AUWSF), a United States–based non-profit corporation.\n\nIn 2016 Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina announced bringing out Higher Educations reforms to establish at least one university or sub-campus at district level across the country for promotion of higher education.\n\nThe following is a list of proposed new universities.\n\n\n"}

It is operated by West Midlands Trains, with services provided by West Midlands Railway and from 2019, London Northwestern Railway operate a service from Rugeley to London Euston that calls at the station. The main entrance is situated inside the Saddlers Shopping Centre.\n\nServices from the station go to Birmingham New Street south on the Walsall Line, (operated on behalf of Transport for West Midlands), and north to Cannock and Rugeley.\n\nThe station has three platforms:\n\nPlatforms 2 and 3 have been recently refurbished, with a new waiting room added and enigmatic \"poetry\" on the walls of the stairs to the platforms. The mainline platforms are electrified to 25 kV AC Overhead power.\n\nAn S&B self-service ticket machine was placed on Platform 1 but was no longer in place in April 2011; however, a similar machine remains in the station booking hall which is at street level above platform 3. The station has a staffed ticket office.\n\nUntil May 2019, Walsall unlike other stations in the West Midlands, was not very well served in terms of a mainline connection as it formerly had services to Wolverhampton, Wellington and Stafford but all these were withdrawn in 2008 due to low numbers and resulting in Walsall losing its connection to Shropshire and Staffordshire. Only a direct service from Wolverhampton to Walsall calls now at 6.00am Saturday morning but one way only. Walsall retains close connections to Rugeley Trent Valley for the West Coast Main Line and there were three services a day to Stafford but only on the peak services to Liverpool Lime Street. This service has since been discontinued after the May 2019 timetable change. However connections can be made at either Birmingham New Street or Rugeley Trent Valley for services to Liverpool Lime Street.\n\nThere were also two morning services a day to Telford and Shrewsbury via Birmingham and Wolverhampton. This service was also introduced in the timetable change in May 2019. They were operated as extensions of the Shrewsbury to Birmingham Line. This replaced the former Liverpool Lime Street service. However in December 2019, following problems with services and disruptions. The Walsall service was once again withdrawn. Replaced by a through Rugeley Trent Valley to Wolverhampton service.\n\nMonday to Saturday daytimes four trains per hour run south from Walsall to Birmingham New Street (two fast and two stopping) with most of the all stations services continuing past Birmingham to form the Birmingham to Wolverhampton stopping service. The fast trains call only at (with one also calling at Bescot Stadium) and are routed via the direct line through Soho and Winson Green, whilst the stopping trains run via .\n\nFrom Walsall to Rugeley Trent Valley the service is half-hourly.\n\nThere is also a service to London which calls at all stations on the Chase Line and then from Walsall to Birmingham before continuing to Coventry, Rugby, Hampton-in-Arden, Northampton, Milton Keynes and London Euston.\n\nFrom December 2020, Walsall will be served by a single direct service to and from London Euston, by Avanti West Coast as part of the West Coast Partnership franchise and from December 2022 there will be an additional northbound service from London Euston.\n\nThe Grand Junction Railway provided the town with its first rail service, albeit indirectly from 1837. Their Birmingham to Warrington line passed to the south and was provided with a station at Bescot Bridge (near the present ), from where travellers could catch a connecting stagecoach. The Grand Junction company laid a branch line from Bescot to a temporary depot in the town at Bridgeman Place a decade later, but it was not until 9 April 1849 that a permanent station was opened on the present site. This was completed by the South Staffordshire Railway as part of their route from Wichnor Junction (south of Burton-upon-Trent) to , which opened the same day. Further route development followed - the SSR added a branch northwards to Cannock in 1858 (which was extended to Rugeley the following autumn), whilst the Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway line linked the town to Wolverhampton via North Walsall in 1872. The network was completed by the Midland Railway, whose line from via opened in 1879. The Midland had by this time also purchased the W&WR from the rival London and North Western Railway, though the LNWR still ran occasional services over it until the 1923 Grouping. The station was rebuilt in 1883, due to increasing traffic levels, with five platforms and separate booking offices for each of the two companies using it. A fire damaged the main booking hall in 1916, but it was not until after the World War I had ended in 1918 that a full rebuild of the concourse could be effected. The new booking hall was completed & opened in 1923.\n\nUnder LMS auspices, the Midland line to Wolverhampton via Wednesfield and Willenhall Stafford Street closed to passengers in 1931 (it being less direct than the older Grand Junction line via Darlaston).\n\nThe line from Birmingham was as part of the London Midland Region's electrification programme. The actual energization of the line from Coventry to Walsall through Aston took place on 15 August 1966.\n\nIn the late 1980s and into the 1990s, vast improvements were made to the quality of services from Walsall. In April 1989 passenger services were reintroduced by British Rail on the previously freight only line to Hednesford 24 years after they were withdrawn. The number of trains to Birmingham was gradually increased from one to four trains per hour and the Hednesford service was extended to Rugeley in 1997 (and subsequently through to Stafford) but the service to Stafford was cut back in 2008 to Rugeley Trent Valley under an agreement with London Midland and WCML operators. Only the now withdrawn daily Liverpool Lime Street services connected Walsall directly with Stafford.\n\nPassenger services to Wolverhampton were reintroduced in 1998 which also ran on occasions to Wellington, but this service was short lived and the regular hourly service was withdrawn again in 2008 due to low passenger numbers. However, one train per day ran straight to Wolverhampton from Walsall, in the evening (leaving Walsall at 19.36) until the May 2013 timetable change as a parliamentary train to avoid the need for formal closure proceedings. This now runs in the opposite direction on Saturdays only (06.38 ex-Wolverhampton). The West Midlands Combined Authority still has ambitions to reinstate a regular (half-hourly) weekday service on the route and reopen the station at Willenhall and Darlaston, but funding problems have precluded any action being taken on the proposals.\n\nWalsall was one of the towns most affected by the Beeching Axe which resulted in passenger services being withdrawn on the lines to Sutton Coldfield, Lichfield, Dudley and Wolverhampton via Willenhall. The service to Rugeley Trent Valley was also closed to passengers leaving towns like Bloxwich, Cannock, Hednesford and Rugeley without a railway connection. The service to Birmingham was also reduced and almost withdrawn until it was saved and later improved.\n\nThe section to Lichfield remained open to freight traffic until 1984 when the line from Ryecroft Junction to Newtown, Brownhills closed to all traffic and the line was lifted and the stations (except Hammerwich) were demolished. The section from Newtown, Brownhills continued to serve Charringtons Oil Terminal until the closure of the terminal in 2001. The line was mothballed and put out of use. The section to Stourbridge remained open to serve as a diversion for freight and served the now-demolished Dudley Freightliner Terminal until 1993 which saw a decline in traffic. The line from Bescot to Harts Hill was mothballed.\n\nProposals would see the reintroduction of services to Wolverhampton via Willenhall with new stations at Darlaston (James Bridge) and Willenhall operated by West Midland Railway giving commuters a faster service to Wolverhampton as opposed to the current service via Birmingham New Street.\n\nThere are also plans to reopen a terminus single platform at Aldridge for trains to Birmingham New Street via Walsall but not to Sutton Coldfield and Water Orton.\n\nIn a strategy which has been conducted by the West Midlands Combined Authority, the line from Walsall to Lichfield has been identified as a disused rail corridor and this means that it is a long term ambition to reopen the line from Walsall to Lichfield, either a rail/light rail corridor. There are also aspirations to reconnect the disused line at Wednesbury to Walsall as either rail or tram.\n\nWalsall would receive new direct services, run by Avanti West Coast, to London Euston.\n\n"}

This bassline originally formed part of an interlude that was intended to feature on the band's 2001 album, \"A Funk Odyssey\", but it was dropped for the final version of the album, only appearing on the test pressing.

Jay Kay's reactions almost exactly fit in with the lyrics; for example, with the line \"I'm throwing out my laser beams\", he shoots lasers at a laser-shooting woman, and with \"I pick a little free agent\", he picks up a dwarf secret agent (Jason Acuña) who shoots the woman but gets thrown away. As the video progresses, Jay Kay rides down the street on a skateboard, and he sees the candyman driving the car, with a lady wearing a red dress as a passenger. He goes into a phone booth and presumably calls his wife or someone else. Then he transforms back into the nerd, who enters a room with the lady, and she tries having sex with him. For a brief moment in the video, the woman appears to be Jay Kay dressed up. The video ends with the nerd lying in an alley.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They also performed in the United States before emigrating there permanently during World War II to escape the deteriorating situation in Austria. In the US, they became well known as the \"Trapp Family Singers\" until ceasing to perform as a unit in 1957. The family's story was later served as the basis for a memoir, two German films, and a Broadway musical. The last surviving of the original seven children, Maria, died in 2014 at the age of 99. Her three half siblings Rosmarie, Eleonore and Johannes are still alive as of 2020.\n\nGeorg von Trapp had seven children at the time of his first wife's Agathe's death and in 1927, he married Maria von Trapp (\"née\" Kutschera), 25 years his junior, with whom he had three more children. Both incarnations of the household were musical and by 1935 the family was singing at the local church in Aigen where they made the acquaintance of a young priest, Dr. Franz Wasner, who encouraged their musical progress and taught them sacred music to add to the folk songs, madrigals and ballads they were already singing. While singing at their Salzburg home they were also heard by the German concert singer Lotte Lehmann who persuaded them to take part in the song competition at the 1936 Salzburg Festival, for which they won a prize; after this, accompanied by Dr Wasner, the family toured and performed in Vienna, Salzburg, and undertook a European tour that encompassed France, Belgium, Holland, Italy, Germany and England.\n\nIn 1938, the family performed in the United States for the first time before returning to Austria when their visas expired; however, in the same year, Adolf Hitler annexed Austria, and the family made the decision to leave first for Italy (of which the Zara-born Georg and thus the family were legally citizens) and from there to the United States, where they applied for immigrant status in 1939. They arrived with very little money, having lost most of the family fortune earlier during a 1935 banking collapse in Austria. Once in the United States they earned money by performing and touring nationally and internationally, first as the \"Trapp Family Choir\" and then, the \"Trapp Family Singers\". After living for a short time in Merion, Pennsylvania, where their youngest child Johannes was born, the family settled in Stowe, Vermont, in 1941. They purchased a farm in 1942 and converted it into the Trapp Family Lodge, initially called \"Cor Unum\". After the war, they founded the Trapp Family Austrian Relief fund, which sent food and clothing to people impoverished in Austria. \n\nBy now based permanently in the United States, the family performed their unique mixture of liturgical music, madrigals, folk music and instrumentals to audiences in over 30 countries for the next 20 years. They made a series of 78-rpm records for RCA Victor in the 1950s, some of which were later issued on RCA Camden LPs. There were also a few later recordings released on LPs, including some stereo sessions. The family singing group disbanded in 1957.\nMaria wrote an account of the singing family \"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers\" which was published in 1949 and was the inspiration for the 1956 West German film \"The Trapp Family\", which in turn inspired the Broadway musical \"The Sound of Music\".\nThe original seven Trapp children (whose names and relative ages were changed for the film version of their life) were Rupert, 1911–1992; Agathe, 1913–2010; Maria, 1914–2014; Werner, 1915–2007; Hedwig, 1917–1972; Johanna, 1919–1994; and Martina, 1921–1952. Maria and Georg's later children were Rosmarie, 1929–, Eleonore (known as Lorli), 1931–, and Johannes, 1939–. The eldest daughter, Agathe (called \"Liesl\" in the film), published her own account of life in the Trapp family in 2003, entitled \"Memories Before and After The Sound of Music\", which was itself turned into a film entitled \"The Von Trapp Family: A Life of Music\".\n\nBoth Georg and Martina died while the group was still active, Georg in 1947 at the age of 67, while Martina died in childbirth in 1952 aged only 30. At the time of its cessation the group included a number of non-family members because many of the original family wanted to pursue other endeavors, and only Maria's \"iron will\" had kept the group together for so long. After the group's demise, Maria, Johannes, Rosmarie, and daughter Maria went to New Guinea to do missionary work; later Maria (the stepmother/mother) returned to run the Trapp Family Lodge for a number of years. Of the children, Rupert was already a medical doctor by the 1940s; Agathe spent many years as kindergarten teacher in Maryland; Maria (the daughter) spent 30 years as a missionary in New Guinea; Werner became a farmer and Hedwig a music teacher; Johanna married and returned to live in Austria; Rosmarie and Eleonore both settled in Vermont; and Johannes followed his mother by managing the Trapp Family Lodge as a tourist resort. Maria (stepmother/mother) died in 1987 and was buried alongside Georg and Martina in the family cemetery on the property. All of the other original 7 children have now died (Hedwig in 1972; Rupert in 1992; Johanna in 1994; Werner in 2007; Agathe in 2010; and Maria in 2014), while Georg and Maria's own 3 children - Rosmarie, Eleonore and Johannes - are still alive.\n\nThe real-life Trapp family were a respected singing group throughout their career, however their style was a world away from the Broadway and Hollywood crowd-pleasing popular numbers as later included in the musical and film versions of their life. Many of their studio recordings survive and have been reproduced as contemporary CD compilations. As for their live performances, in his 2004 essay \"Family values: The Trapp Family Singers in North America, 1938-1956\", Michael Saffle writes:\nIt is difficult to document today precisely what the Trapps performed and where they performed it. Only a very few of their programs have been reprinted. One of these—again, a Christmas program—identifies an arrangement of three short pieces (for \"Antique Instruments\") and a Sonata by Sammartini (presented by a \"Quintet of Recorders\") as the evening's principal instrumental selections; shorter vocal works included Praetorius's \"Es ist ein Ros' entsprungen,\" a Monteverdi madrigal, Holst's \"Midwinter,\" and an arrangement of \"The Holly and the Ivy.\" Another program—unfortunately incomplete, but known to have been presented in 1943 at Boston's Jordan Hall—featured a song by John Dowland, transcriptions by Wasner of Tyrolean folk tunes, and a Trio for two recorders and viola da gamba composed by \"Werner von Trapp.\" In spite of their instrumental accomplishments, however, the Trapps were above all a vocal ensemble that sang (and played) music together largely for religious reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, press releases subsequent to 1941 advertised \"rollicking folk songs of many lands,\" \"gay, lilting madrigals,\" and \"lusty yodels and mountain calls\" as well as \"exquisite old motets and masses,\" and bragged of \"record cross-country tour[s]\" and large numbers of engagements, which attested to their popular appeal and suggests that the religious content was only one of several contributing elements to this over their main period of popularity in America.\n\nFour grandchildren of Werner von Trapp (great-grandchildren of Georg and step great-grandchildren of Maria) formed a singing group \"The von Trapps\" and recorded five albums in a modern style between 2001 and 2016 before disbanding.\n\n[more details awaited]\n\n\n\n\n"}

Her mother, Joan, is a realtor at RE/MAX in her home town and her father, Peter, owns Chase Equipment in New Milford. She is a 1997 graduate of Brookfield High School.\n\nThe buxom DeMato was heavily featured in coverage of the early rounds of \"American Idol\", including the showing of drama with fellow singer Kimberly Caldwell during the \"Hollywood\" phase. She sang Dusty Springfield's hit \"Son of a Preacher Man\" in the semi-finals. In the finals, she sang \"Flashdance... What a Feeling\" and \"Where Did Our Love Go\", before being voted off on March 26, 2003 after a rendition of Faith Hill's \"Breathe\".\n\nAfter the show, she had some success on the American Idol concert tour, singing \"Beautiful\" by Christina Aguilera. She also recorded a cover of \"At Last\" by Etta James on the \"American Idol 2 Love Songs\" CD. DeMato's versions of these songs were well regarded by fans and reviewers.\n\nHowever, her brief musical career peaked with the CD and the concert tour, and further success eluded her. Later in 2003, she had a short stint as a judge for the Oxygen Network's show \"Meow TV\".\n\nShe was unable to secure a recording contract with an established company, but did record one song, \"Let It Rain\", with a company called Somme Music - an Internet storefront marketing that one song. Reaction to this song was mixed: some liked the vocals and also the music, while others had a problem with the composition and the negative tone of some of the lyrics (written by the head of Somme Music). No further songs were recorded.\n\nLiving in her home town of Brookfield, and working once more as a cosmetologist, she has appeared as a singer on an occasional basis, mostly in Connecticut. Between July 22 and August 2, 2008 Julia and former Idol contestants Trenyce, RJ Helton, Frenchie Davis, and Rickey Smith performed at the Razz Room in San Francisco. Vonzell Solomon, Constantine Maroulis, and David Hernandez also appeared in the Razz Room from August 5–16.\n\nOn June 18, 2009, Julia DeMato began hosting a 12-week \"Summer Idol\" Karaoke event at Rowley's Tavern, a local Irish style pub located in Norwalk, Connecticut. Julia starts off the evening singing a song, then offering color commentary and announcing upcoming singers. Other appearances in Connecticut include singing the National Anthem at the Thompson International Speedway at a NASCAR event.\n\nOn April 15, 2010 Demato and \"Idol\" alums Ace Young, Diana DeGarmo, Jorge Núñez, and RJ Helton lent a helping hand to hungry New Yorkers by delivering food with City Harvest.\n\nOn July 6, 2005, she and her fiancé at the time, Jim Polches, became parents when she gave birth in Danbury, Connecticut. She and Polches never wed.\n\nIn December, 2005, she made a brief return to the news when she was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine, as well as driving while intoxicated after failing a field sobriety test. At first, DeMato claimed it had all been a misunderstanding. While Connecticut has severe penalties against drunk driving, she was able to avoid a jail term and a criminal record by negotiating, through her lawyer, an alternative sentence involving community service and a program of drug and alcohol education.\n\n"}

The song is written from the viewpoint of a prostitute advertising \"love for sale\".\n\nThe song's chorus, like many in the Great American Songbook, is written in the A-A-B-A format. However, instead of 32 bars, it has 64, plus an 8-bar tag. The tag is often dropped when the song is performed. The tune, like many of Porter's, shifts between a major and minor feeling. The A section is in the key of B-flat minor before modulating to B-flat major and back.\n\nWhen the song came out in 1930, a newspaper labelled it as 'in bad taste'. Radio stations avoided broadcasting it. \nBecause of the complaints, Porter shifted the setting of the song in the musical to the Cotton Club in Harlem where it was sung by an Afro-American Elisabeth Welch instead of a white singer Kathryn Crawford.<br>\n\nPopular recordings in 1931 were made by Libby Holman and by Fred Waring's Pennsylvanians.\n\nIt is also widely recorded as a jazz standard.

Peakhurst is in the local government area of the Georges River Council.\n\nPeakhurst has a western border on Salt Pan Creek, on the Georges River. Peakhurst Heights is a separate suburb to the south, which is bordered by Boggywell Creek and Lime Kiln Bay, on the Georges River. Peakhurst Heights is sometimes still considered to be part of 'Peakhurst' by some residents of the area.\n\nPeakhurst was named after landholder John Robert Peake, who bought 10 acres of land near the junction of the present Forest Road and Henry Lawson Drive in 1838. He gave a block of land on which the Wesleyan Church was built in 1855.\n\nThe area was originally part of an 1808 land grant to Captain John Townson. John Robert Peake bought his land from William Hebblewhite in 1838. School Inspector Huffer suggested that Peake's name be used to name the suburb when the public school was founded in 1871. The post office opened in 1885.\n\nThe first industry in the area was timber-cutting, due to the surrounding natural forests being thick with a variety of woods, especially turpentine. The timber was carted to Sydney by bullock teams.\nAs the land was cleared, orchardists followed the timber-cutters.\n\nPeakhurst's commercial centres are predominantly located along Forest Road and Boundary Road. Various retail shops, restaurants and cafes are located near the Peakhurst Inn Hotel on Forest Road. The hotel contains a pub and drive-through bottle shop. Peakhurst also contains a sizeable industrial area mainly on and around Boundary Road.\n\nThe main roads are Forest Road, Henry Lawson Drive, Stoney Creek Road, Boundary Road, Bonds Road, Broad Arrow Road, Isaac Street, Baumans Road. Forest Road, which links to Henry Lawson Drive at Peakhurst, is the busiest carriageway that extends through numerous other suburbs in Sydney.\n\nBuses operate through Peakhurst.\nThere are four public schools: Georges River College Peakhurst Campus, Peakhurst Public School, Peakhurst South Public School, Peakhurst West Public School.\n\nGeorges River Life Church, Church@thepeak Anglican Church, Our Lady of Fatima Catholic Church, St Abraam and St Mikhail Al-Behairy Coptic Orthodox Church, Peakhurst Uniting Church, Spanish Evangelical Jerusalem Baptist Church, Samoan Assembly of God Church.\n\nPopular recreational venues include Grandviews Bowling Club (lawn bowls), tennis courts, Peakhurst Park and the numerous sporting fields located at Gannon's Park. The soccer clubs here are Peakhurst United and Forest Rangers.\n\nAccording to the 2006 Australian Bureau of Statistics Census of Population, there were 9,113 people usually resident in Peakhurst. 23.4% stated they were born overseas with the top countries of birth being China 2.9%, United Kingdom 2.7% and Republic of Macedonia 1.4%. English was stated as the only language spoken at home by 7%?? of residents and the most common other languages spoken were Arabic 4.9%, Greek 4.6% and Cantonese 3.6%. The most common responses for religious affiliation were Catholic 28.1%, Anglican 21.6% and Orthodox 10.1%.\n\n\nThe City of Hurstville local government area which administers Peakhurst, consists of 12 councillors elected every four years. Peakhurst falls into two Wards of the city: Peakhurst Ward and Penshurst Ward. A further five suburbs are contained wholly or partly in the Peakhurst Ward: Riverwood, Mortdale, Oatley, Lugarno and Peakhurst Heights.\n\nAn audit of the environmental impact of the industrial area was commenced in September 2002. Bushcare volunteers help preserve remnant pockets of native forestation. A very small number of fresh water watercourses exist in the suburb, mostly draining into Salt Pan Creek. A portion of the Peakhurst tree population was included in the 1990 National Trust Lugarno Tree Study.\n\n"}

OS/6 was superseded by the IBM Displaywriter in 1980.\n\nThe intended configuration is a console with a keyboard, a small, approximately 9\" CRT character display and either a daisy wheel or IBM 46/40 ink jet printer, renamed the IBM 6640. Documents are stored on 8-inch floppy diskettes and magnetic stripe card, which is exchangeable with IBM's previous generation of Mag Card Selectrics. The display is pre-WYSIWYG, so special symbols embedded in the displayed text mark formatting information the user can edit. Navigation is pre-mouse and uses arrow keys.\n\nIn an age before PCs, when typing was still done primarily only by clerical staff, the OS/6 was intended for what IBM envisioned as centralized word processing centers at large organizations. It includes features like mail merge, very high print quality with lots of formatting options and printers that can feed envelopes or sheets from two drawers, usually referred to within IBM as letterhead and second sheet. Data from Office System/6 can be migrated to IBM 5110 and 5120 with third-party applications.\n\nInternally, the OS/6 uses an IBM proprietary 16-bit single-chip microprocessor called the OPD Mini Processor. This processor is a single-chip FET microprocessor designed by Richard Vrba. It had a 16-bit little-endian instruction set built on an 8-bit internal architecture. Sixteen general-purpose registers, implemented as a 32-byte window in memory that operated as a stack, could be used as instruction operands or for indirect references to operands in memory.\n\nDevelopment on OS/6 was done in the \"Rio\" project at IBM's Austin, Texas facilities. A proposed video display upgrade for the Selectric Mag Card II had been rejected. Instead, it was announced in 1977 that Mag Card II users would be able to add a communications option to link up with System 6.\n\nIn a 1977 presentation the System 6 was shown with the models 6/430, 6/440, and 6/450. One year later the models 6/442 and 6/452 were shown additionally. System 6 building blocks are monitor, keyboard, magnetic card unit, inkjet, and daisy wheel printers, and a floppy disk station.\n\nIn 1978, a stand-alone CPU (without magnetic card and printing capabilities) was added to the product line, the IBM 6/420 Information Processor.\n\nIn 1979, a communication-enabled laser printer and photocopier combination was introduced, the IBM 6670 Information Distributor.\n\nAlso in 1979, IBM General Systems Division (GSD) introduced IBM 5520 systems, not related to System 6, with some overlapping functionality and performance.\n\nOS/6 was superseded by the IBM Displaywriter in 1980.\n\n"}

{"id": "2112366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112366", "title": "Ancient Celtic religion", "text": "Ancient Celtic religion\n\nAncient Celtic religion, commonly known as Celtic paganism, comprises the religious beliefs and practices adhered to by the Iron Age people of Western Europe now known as the Celts, roughly between 500 BCE and 500 CE, spanning the La Tène period and the Roman era, and in the case of the Insular Celts the British and Irish Iron Age. Very little is known with any certainty about the subject, and apart from documented names that are thought to be of deities, the only detailed contemporary accounts are by hostile and probably not-well-informed Roman writers. \nCeltic paganism was one of a larger group of Iron Age polytheistic religions of the Indo-European family. It comprised a large degree of variation both geographically and chronologically, although \"behind this variety, broad structural similarities can be detected\" allowing there to be \"a basic religious homogeneity\" among the Celtic peoples.\n\nThe Celtic pantheon consists of numerous recorded theonyms, both from Greco-Roman ethnography and from epigraphy. Among the most prominent ones are Teutatis, Taranis and Lugus. Figures from medieval Irish mythology have also been interpreted as iterations of earlier pre-Christian Insular deities in the study of comparative mythology.\n\nAccording to Greek and Roman accounts, in Gaul, Britain and Ireland, there was a priestly caste of \"magico-religious specialists\" known as the druids, although very little is definitely known about them. Following the Roman Empire's conquest of Gaul (58–51 BCE) and southern Britannia (43 AD), Celtic religious practices began to display elements of Romanisation, resulting in a syncretic Gallo-Roman culture with its own religious traditions with its own large set of deities, such as Cernunnos, Artio, Telesphorus, etc.\n\nIn Roman Britain this lost at least some ground to Christianity by the time the Romans left in 410, and in the next century began to be replaced by the pagan Anglo-Saxon religion over much of the country. Christianity had resumed missionary activity by the later 5th and the 6th centuries, also in Ireland, and the Celtic population was gradually Christianized supplanting the earlier religious traditions. However, polytheistic traditions left a legacy in many of the Celtic nations, influenced later mythology, and served as the basis for a new religious movement, Celtic Neopaganism, in the 20th century.\n\nComparatively little is known about Celtic paganism because the evidence for it is fragmentary, due largely to the fact that the Celts who practiced it wrote nothing down about their religion. Therefore, all there is to study their religion from is the literature from the early Christian period, commentaries from classical Greek and Roman scholars, and archaeological evidence.\n\nThe archaeologist Barry Cunliffe summarised the sources for Celtic religion as \"fertile chaos\", borrowing the term from the Irish scholar Proinsias MacCana. Cunliffe went on to note that \"there is more, varied, evidence for Celtic religion than for any other example of Celtic life. The only problem is to assemble it in a systematic form which does not too greatly oversimplify the intricate texture of its detail.\"\n\nThe archaeological evidence does not contain the bias inherent in the literary sources. Nonetheless, the interpretation of this evidence can be colored by the 21st century mindset. Various archaeological discoveries have aided understanding of the religion of the Celts. \n\nMost surviving Celtic art is not figurative; some art historians have suggested that the complex and compelling decorative motifs that characterize some periods have a religious significance, but the understanding of what that might be appears to be irretrievably lost. Surviving figurative monumental sculpture comes almost entirely from Romano-Celtic contexts, and broadly follows provincial Roman styles, though figures who are probably deities often wear torcs, and there may be inscriptions in Roman letters with what appear to be Romanized Celtic names. The Pillar of the Boatmen from Paris, with many deity figures, is the most comprehensive example, datable by a dedication to the Emperor Tiberius (r. from 14 AD). \n\nMonumental stone sculptures from before conquest by the Romans are much more rare, and it is far from clear that deities are represented. The most significant are the Warrior of Hirschlanden and \"Glauberg Prince\" (respectively 6th and 5th-century BCE, from Germany), the Mšecké Žehrovice Head (probably 2nd-century BCE, Czech Republic), and sanctuaries of some sort at the southern French oppida of Roquepertuse and Entremont. There are also a number of Celtiberian standing \"warrior\" figures, and several other stone heads from various areas. In general, even early monumental sculpture is found in areas with higher levels of contact with the classical world, through trade. It is possible that wooden monumental sculpture was more common. Small heads are more common, mainly surviving as ornament in metalwork, and there are also animals and birds that may have a religious significance, as on the Basse Yutz Flagons. The Strettweg Cult Wagon is probably associated with libations or sacrifices, and pairs of metal \"spoons\" probably used for divination have been found.\n\nCeltic coinage, from the late 4th century BCE until conquest, clearly copies Greek and Roman examples, sometimes very closely, but the heads and horses that are the most popular motifs may have a local religious significance. There are also the coins of the Roman provinces in the Celtic lands of \"Gaul\", \"Raetia\", \"Noricum\", and \"Britannia\", \n\nMost of the surviving monuments and their accompanying inscriptions belong to the Roman period and reflect a considerable degree of syncretism between Celtic and Roman gods; even where figures and motifs appear to derive from pre-Roman tradition, they are difficult to interpret in the absence of a preserved literature on mythology. A notable example of this is the horned god that was called Cernunnos; several depictions and inscriptions of him have been found, but very little is known about the myths that would have been associated with him or how he was worshipped.\n\nLiterary evidence for Celtic religion also comes from sources written in Ireland and Wales during the Middle Ages, a period when traditional Celtic religious practices had become extinct and had long been replaced by Christianity. The evidence from Ireland has been recognised as better than that from Wales, being viewed as \"both older and less contaminated from foreign material.\" These sources, which are in the form of epic poems and tales, were written several centuries after Christianity became the dominant religion in these regions, and were written down by Christian monks, \"who may not merely have been hostile to the earlier paganism but actually ignorant of it.\" Instead of treating the characters as deities, they are allocated the roles of being historical heroes who sometimes have supernatural or superhuman powers, for instance, in the Irish sources the gods are claimed to be an ancient tribe of humans known as the Tuatha Dé Danann. \n\nWhile it is possible to single out specific texts that can be strongly argued to encapsulate genuine echoes or resonances of the pre-Christian past, opinion is divided as to whether these texts contain substantive material derived from oral tradition as preserved by bards or whether they were the creation of the medieval monastic tradition.\n\nVarious Greek and Roman writers of the ancient world commented on the Celts and their beliefs. Barry Cunliffe stated that \"the Greek and Roman texts provide a number of pertinent observations, but these are at best anecdotal, offered largely as a colourful background by writers whose prime intention was to communicate other messages.\" The Roman general Julius Caesar, when leading the conquering armies of the Roman Republic against Celtic Gaul, made various descriptions of the inhabitants, though some of his claims, such as that the Druids practiced human sacrifice by burning people in wicker men, have come under scrutiny by modern scholars.\n\nHowever, the key problem with the use of these sources is that they were often biased against the Celts, whom the classical peoples viewed as \"barbarians\". In the case of the Romans who conquered several Celtic realms, they would have likely been biased in favour of making the Celts look uncivilised, thereby giving the \"civilised\" Romans more reason to conquer them.\n\nCeltic religion was polytheistic, believing in many deities, both gods and goddesses, some of which were venerated only in a small, local area, but others whose worship had a wider geographical distribution. The names of over two hundred of these deities have survived to us today, although it is likely that many of these names were different titles or epithets used for the same deity.\n\nSome Celtic theonyms can be established as Pan-Celtic (descending from the Common Celtic period) by comparing Continental with Insular Celtic evidence. An example of this is Gaulish Lugus, whose name is cognate with Irish Lugh and Welsh Lleu.\nAnother example is Gaulish Brigantia, cognate with Irish Brigid. This latter theonym can even be reconstructed as a Proto-Indo-European epithet of the dawn goddess, as \"*bʰr̥ǵʰntī\" \"the one on high\".\n\nSome of the Greek and Roman accounts mention various deities worshipped in Gaul; for instance Lucan noted the names of Teutates, Taranis and Esus, although Julius Caesar instead conflated the Celtic Gaulish deities with those of Roman religion, and did not mention their native Gaulish names. He declared that the most widely venerated god in Gaul was Mercury, the Roman god of trade, but that they also worshipped Apollo, Minerva, Mars and Jupiter.\n\nAccording to other classical sources, the Celts worshiped the forces of nature and did not envisage deities in anthropomorphic terms, as other \"pagan\" peoples such as the Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians did. Whether or not this is true, as the classical peoples grew in influence over the Celtic cultures, it encouraged the depiction of deities in human forms, and they appear to move from a more animistic-based faith to a more Romanised polytheistic view.\n\nSeveral of these deities, including Lugus and Matrones, were triple deities.\n\nIn the Irish and Welsh vernacular sources from the Middle Ages, various human mythological figures were featured who have been thought of by many scholars as being based upon earlier gods. The historian Ronald Hutton however cautioned against automatically equating all Irish and Welsh mythological figures as former deities, noting that while some characters \"who appear to be human, such as Medb or St Brigit, probably were indeed once regarded as divine ... the warriors who are the main protagonists of the stories have the same status as those in the Greek myths, standing between the human and divine orders. To regard characters such as Cú Chulainn, Fergus Mac Roich or Conall Cernach as former gods turned into humans by a later storyteller is to misunderstand their literary and religious function ... Cú Chulainn is no more a former god than Superman is.\"\n\nExamining these Irish myths, Barry Cunliffe stated that he believed they displayed \"a dualism between the male tribal god and the female deity of the land\" while Anne Ross felt that they displayed that the gods were \"on the whole intellectual, deeply versed in the native learning, poets and prophets, story-tellers and craftsmen, magicians, healers, warriors ... in short, equipped with every quality admired and desired by the Celtic peoples themselves.\"\n\nInsular Celts swore their oaths by their tribal gods, and the land, sea and sky; as in, \"I swear by the gods by whom my people swear\" and \"If I break my oath, may the land open to swallow me, the sea rise to drown me, and the sky fall upon me.\"\n\nSome scholars, such as Prudence Jones and Nigel Pennick, have speculated that the Celts venerated certain trees and others, such as Miranda Aldhouse-Green, that the Celts were animists, believing that all aspects of the natural world contained spirits, and that communication was possible with these spirits.\n\nPlaces such as rocks, streams, mountains, and trees may all have had shrines or offerings devoted to a deity residing there. These would have been local deities, known and worshiped by inhabitants living near to the shrine itself, and not pan-Celtic like some of the polytheistic gods. The importance of trees in Celtic religion may be shown by the fact that the very name of the Eburonian tribe contains a reference to the yew tree, and that names like Mac Cuilinn (son of holly) and Mac Ibar (son of yew) appear in Irish myths. In Ireland, wisdom was symbolised by the salmon who feed on the hazelnuts from the trees that surround the well of wisdom (\"Tobar Segais\").\n\nCeltic burial practices, which included burying grave goods of food, weapons, and ornaments with the dead, suggest a belief in life after death.\n\nThe druids, the Celtic learned classes that included members of the clergy, were said by Caesar to have believed in reincarnation and transmigration of the soul along with astronomy and the nature and power of the gods.\n\nA common factor in later mythologies from Christianized Celtic nations was the otherworld. This was the realm of the fairy folk and other supernatural beings, who would entice humans into their realm. Sometimes this otherworld was claimed to exist underground, while at other times it was said to lie far to the west. Several scholars have suggested that the otherworld was the Celtic afterlife, though there is no direct evidence to prove this.\n\nEvidence suggests that among the Celts, \"offerings to the gods were made throughout the landscape – both the natural and the domestic.\" At times they worshipped in constructed temples and shrines, evidence for which have been unearthed across the Celtic world by archaeologists, although according to Greco-Roman accounts, they also worshipped in areas of the natural world that were held to be sacred, namely in groves of trees. Across Celtic Europe, many of the constructed temples, which were square in shape and constructed out of wood, were found in rectangular ditched enclosures known as \"viereckschanzen\", where in cases such as Holzhausen in Bavaria votive offerings were also buried in deep shafts. However, in the British Isles, temples were more commonly circular in design. According to Barry Cunliffe, \"the monumentality of the Irish religious sites sets them apart from their British and continental European counterparts\" with the most notable examples being the Hill of Tara, and Navan Fort.\n\nHowever, according to Greco-Roman accounts of the druids and other Celts, worship was held in groves, with Tacitus describing how his men cut down \"groves sacred to savage rites.\" By their very nature, such groves would not survive in the archaeological record, and so we have no direct evidence for them today. Alongside groves, certain springs were also viewed as sacred and used as places of worship in the Celtic world. Notable Gaulish examples include the sanctuary of Sequana at the source of the Seine in Burgundy and Chamalieres near to Clermont-Ferrand. At both of these sites, a large array of votive offerings have been uncovered, most of which are wooden carvings, although some of which are embossed pieces of metal.\n\nIn many cases, when the Roman Empire took control of Celtic lands, earlier Iron Age sacred sites were reused, with Roman temples being built on the same sites. Examples include Uley in Gloucestershire, Worth in Kent, Hayling Island in Hampshire, Vendeuil-Caply in Oise, Saint-Germain-le-Rocheux in Chatillon-sur-Seine and Schleidweiler in Trier.\n\nThe Celts made votive offerings to their deities, which were buried in the earth or thrown into rivers or bogs. According to Barry Cunliffe, in most cases, deposits were placed in the same places on numerous occasions, indicating continual usage \"over a period of time, perhaps on a seasonal basis or when a particular event, past or pending, demanded a propitiatory response.\"\n\nIn particular, there was a trend to offer items associated with warfare in watery areas, evidence for which is found not only in the Celtic regions, but also in Late Bronze Age (and therefore pre-Celtic) societies and those outside of the Celtic area, namely Denmark. One of the most notable examples is the river Thames in southern England, where a number of items had been deposited, only to be discovered by archaeologists millennia later. Some of these, like the Battersea Shield, Wandsworth Shield and the Waterloo Helmet, would have been prestige goods that would have been labour-intensive to make and thereby probably expensive. Another example is at Llyn Cerrig Bach in Anglesey, Wales, where offerings, primarily those related to battle, were thrown into the lake from a rocky outcrop in the late first century BCE or early first century CE.\n\nAt times, jewellery and other high prestige items that were not related to warfare were also deposited in a ritual context. At Niederzier in the Rhineland for example, a post that excavators believed had religious significance had a bowl buried next to it in which was contained forty-five coins, two torcs and an armlet, all of which made out of gold, and similar deposits have been uncovered elsewhere in Celtic Europe.\n\nAccording to Roman sources, Celtic Druids engaged extensively in human sacrifice. According to Julius Caesar, the slaves and dependents of Gauls of rank would be burnt along with the body of their master as part of his funerary rites. He also describes how they built wicker figures that were filled with living humans and then burned. According to Cassius Dio, Boudica's forces impaled Roman captives during her rebellion against the Roman occupation, to the accompaniment of revelry and sacrifices in the sacred groves of Andate. Different gods reportedly required different kinds of sacrifices. Victims meant for Esus were hanged, Tollund Man being an example, those meant for Taranis immolated and those for Teutates drowned. Some, like the Lindow Man, may have gone to their deaths willingly.\n\nRitual decapitation was a major religious and cultural practice which has found copious support in the archaeological record, including the numerous skulls discovered in Londinium's River Walbrook and the 12 headless corpses at the French late Iron Age sanctuary of Gournay-sur-Aronde.\n\nSome Irish bog bodies from various periods are interpreted as local \"kings\" who were ritually executed, presumably after crop failures or other disasters. Old Croghan Man, from between 362 and 175 BCE, is an example, as is the far older Bronze Age Cashel Man.\n\nThe iconography of the human head is believed by many archaeologists and historians to have played a significant part in Celtic religion. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, writing in the 1st century BCE, described how Celtic warriors \"cut off the heads of enemies slain in battle and attach them to the necks of their horses.\" Strabo meanwhile commented in the same century that until the Roman authorities put a stop to it, among the Celts, \"the heads of enemies held in high repute they used to embalm in cedar oil and exhibit to strangers.\" Archaeological evidence indicating that the Celts did indeed behead humans and then display their heads, possibly for religious purposes, has been unearthed at a number of excavations; one notable example of this was found at the Gaulish site of Entremont near to Aix-en-Provence, where a fragment of a pillar carved with images of skulls was found, within which were niches where actual human skulls were kept, nailed into position, fifteen examples of which were found. Roquepertuse nearby has similar heads and skull niches; the Mšecké Žehrovice Head from the modern Czech Republic is a famous solitary stone head. On smaller decorated objects, heads often appear, or face-masks emerge from what may at first seem to be purely abstract patterning.\n\nThe archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believed that the Celts held \"reverence for the power of the head\" and that \"to own and display a distinguished head was to retain and control the power of the dead person\" while the archaeologist Anne Ross asserted that \"the Celts venerated the head as a symbol of divinity and the powers of the otherworld, and regarded it as the most important bodily member, the very seat of the soul.\" The archaeologist Miranda Aldhouse-Green meanwhile stated that \"I refute any suggestion that the head itself was worshipped but it was clearly venerated as the most significant element in a human or divine image representing the whole.\" The historian Ronald Hutton however criticised the idea of the \"cult of the human head\", believing that both the literary and archaeological evidence did not warrant this conclusion, noting that \"the frequency with which human heads appears upon Celtic metalwork proves nothing more than they were a favourite decorative motif, among several, and one just as popular among non-Celtic peoples.\"\n\nAccording to a number of Greco-Roman writers such as Julius Caesar, Cicero, Tacitus and Pliny the Elder, Gaulish and British society held a group of magico-religious specialists known as the druids in high esteem. Their roles and responsibilities differed somewhat between the different accounts, but Caesar's, which was the \"fullest\" and \"earliest original text\" to describe the druids, described them as being concerned with \"divine worship, the due performance of sacrifices, private or public, and the interpretation of ritual questions.\" He also claimed that they were responsible for officiating at human sacrifices, such as the wicker man burnings. Nonetheless, a number of historians have criticised these such accounts, believing them to be biased or inaccurate. Vernacular Irish sources also referred to the druids, portraying them not only as priests but as sorcerers who had supernatural powers that they used for cursing and divination and who opposed the coming of Christianity. \n\nVarious historians and archaeologists have interpreted the druids in different ways; Peter Berresford Ellis for instance believed them to be the equivalents of the Indian Brahmin caste, while Anne Ross believed that they were essentially tribal priests, having more in common with the shamans of tribal societies than with the classical philosophers. Ronald Hutton meanwhile held a particularly sceptical attitude to many claims made about them, and he supported the view that the evidence available was of such a suspicious nature that \"we can know virtually nothing of certainty about the ancient Druids, so that – although they certainly existed – they function more or less as legendary figures.\"\n\nIn Ireland the fili were visionary poets, which many get confused with Vates, associated with lorekeeping, versecraft, and the memorisation of vast numbers of poems. They were also magicians, as Irish magic is intrinsically connected to poetry, and the satire of a gifted poet was a serious curse upon the one being satirised. In Ireland a \"bard\" was considered a lesser grade of poet than a \"fili\" – more of a minstrel and rote reciter than an inspired artist with magical powers. In the Welsh tradition, the poet is always referred to as a \"bardd\". \n\nThe Celtic poets, of whatever grade, were composers of eulogy and satire, and a chief duty was that of composing and reciting verses on heroes and their deeds, and memorising the genealogies of their patrons. It was essential to their livelihood that they increase the fame of their patrons, via tales, poems and songs. In the 1st century CE, the Latin author Lucan referred to \"bards\" as the national poets or minstrels of Gaul and Britain. In Roman Gaul the institution gradually disappeared, whereas in Ireland and Wales it survived into the European Middle Ages. In Wales, the bardic order was revived, and codified by the poet and forger Iolo Morganwg; this tradition has persisted, centred around the many eisteddfods at every level of Welsh literary society.\n\nThe oldest attested Celtic calendar is the Coligny calendar, dated to the 2nd century and as such firmly within the Gallo-Roman period.\n\nSome feast days of the medieval Irish calendar have sometimes been speculated to descend from prehistoric festivals, especially by comparison to terms found in the Coligny calendar. This concerns Beltane in particular, which is attributed ancient origin by medieval Irish writers.\nThe festivals of Samhain and Imbolc are not associated with \"paganism\" or druidry in Irish legend, but there have nevertheless been suggestions of a prehistoric background since the 19th century, in the case of Samhain by John Rhys and James Frazer who assumed that this festival marked the \"Celtic new year\".\n\nThe Celtic peoples of Gaul and Hispania under Roman rule fused Roman religious forms and modes of worship with indigenous traditions.\nIn some cases, Gaulish deity names were used as epithets for Roman deities, as with Lenus Mars or Jupiter Poeninus. In other cases, Roman gods were given Gaulish female partners – for example, Mercury was paired with Rosmerta and Sirona was partnered with Apollo. In at least one case – that of the equine goddess Epona – a native Celtic goddess was also adopted by Romans. This process of identifying Celtic deities with their Roman counterparts was known as Interpretatio romana.\n\nEastern mystery religions penetrated Gaul early on. These included the cults of Orpheus, Mithras, Cybele, and Isis.\nThe imperial cult, centred primarily on the \"numen\" of Augustus, came to play a prominent role in public religion in Gaul, most dramatically at the pan-Gaulish ceremony venerating Rome and Augustus at the Condate Altar near Lugdunum on 1 August.\n\nGenerally Roman worship practices such as offerings of incense and animal sacrifice, dedicatory inscriptions, and naturalistic statuary depicting deities in anthropomorphic form were combined with specific Gaulish practices such as circumambulation around a temple. This gave rise to a characteristic Gallo-Roman fanum, identifiable in archaeology from its concentric shape.\n\nCeltic societies under Roman rule presumably underwent a gradual Christianization in similar ways to the rest of the Empire; there is next to nothing in Christian sources about specific issues relating to Celtic people in the Empire, or their religion. Saint Paul's \"Epistle to the Galatians\" was addressed to a congregation that might have included people from a Celtic background.\n\nIn Ireland, the main Celtic country unconquered by the Romans, the conversion to Christianity (Christianization) inevitably had a profound effect on the socio-religious system from the 5th century onward, though its character can only be extrapolated from documents of considerably later date. By the early 7th century the church had succeeded in relegating Irish druids to ignominious irrelevancy, while the \"filidh,\" masters of traditional learning, operated in easy harmony with their clerical counterparts, contriving at the same time to retain a considerable part of their pre-Christian tradition, social status, and privilege. But virtually all the vast corpus of early vernacular literature that has survived was written down in monastic scriptoria, and it is part of the task of modern scholarship to identify the relative roles of traditional continuity and ecclesiastical innovation as reflected in the written texts. \n\nCormac's Glossary (c. 900 CE) recounts that St. Patrick banished those mantic rites of the \"filidh\" that involved offerings to \"demons\", and that the church took particular pains to stamp out animal sacrifice and other rituals repugnant to Christian teaching. What survived of ancient ritual practice tended to be related to \"filidhecht\", the traditional repertoire of the \"filidh\", or to the central institution of sacral kingship. A good example is the pervasive and persistent concept of the hierogamy (sacred marriage) of the king with the goddess of sovereignty: the sexual union, or \"banais ríghi\" (\"wedding of kingship\"), which constituted the core of the royal inauguration, seems to have been purged from the ritual at an early date through ecclesiastical influence, but it remains at least implicit, and often quite explicit, for many centuries in the literary tradition.\n\nNagy has noted the Gaelic oral tradition has been remarkably conservative; the fact that we have tales in existence that were still being told in the 19th century in almost exactly the same form as they exist in ancient manuscripts leads to the strong probability that much of what the monks recorded was considerably older. Though the Christian interpolations in some of these tales are very obvious, many of them read like afterthoughts or footnotes to the main body of the tales, which most likely preserve traditions far older than the manuscripts themselves.\n\nMythology based on (though, not identical to) the pre-Christian traditions was still common place knowledge in Celtic-speaking cultures in the 19th century. In the Celtic Revival, such survivals were collected and edited, thus becoming a literary tradition, which in turn influenced modern mainstream \"Celticity\".\n\nVarious rituals involving acts of pilgrimage to sites such as hills and sacred wells that are believed to have curative or otherwise beneficial properties are still performed. Based on evidence from the European continent, various figures that are still known in folklore in the Celtic countries up to today, or who take part in post-Christian mythology, are known to have also been worshiped in those areas that did not have records before Christianity.\n\nIn \"Twilight of the Celtic Gods\" (1996), Clarke and Roberts describe a number of particularly conservative folkloristic traditions in remote rural areas of Great Britain, including the Peak District and Yorkshire Dales, including claims of surviving pre-Christian Celtic traditions of veneration of stones, trees and bodies of water.\n\nVarious Neopagan groups claim association with Celtic paganism. These groups range from the Reconstructionists, who work to practice ancient Celtic religion with as much accuracy as possible; to new age, eclectic groups who take some of their inspiration from Celtic mythology and iconography, the most notable of which is Neo-druidry.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2112372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112372", "title": "Baltimore and Potomac Railroad", "text": "Baltimore and Potomac Railroad\n\nThe Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (B&P) operated from Baltimore, Maryland, southwest to Washington, D.C., from 1872 to 1902. Controlled by the Pennsylvania Railroad, it was the second railroad company to connect the nation's capital to the Northeastern States, and competed with the older Baltimore & Ohio Railroad.\n\nPart of the B&P route is now part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, the most heavily traveled American intercity passenger line; and of the Penn Line of the Maryland Transit Administration's MARC commuter train service. Its Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel, bored under north Baltimore in 1871, remains in use.\n\nThe leading advocate for expanding the railroad system into southern Maryland was Walter Bowie, who wrote newspaper articles and columns under the pen name \"Patuxent Planter\" and who joined Thomas Fielder Bowie, William Duckett Bowie, and Oden Bowie (later Governor of Maryland), in lobbying the Maryland General Assembly to approve the idea. Their efforts bore fruit on May 6, 1853, when lawmakers chartered the \"Baltimore and Potomac Rail Road Company\", granting it the authority to construct a railroad from Baltimore via Upper Marlboro in Prince George's County and Port Tobacco in neighboring Charles County to a point on the Potomac River between Liverpool Point and the St. Mary's River in St. Mary's County, southernmost in the state. The charter also allowed the construction of branches of up to in length.\n\nThe B&P was organized on December 19, 1858, and began surveying the route on May 3, 1859. Construction started in 1861 but with increasing delays caused by the American Civil War with its nearby conflicts and supplies shortages, progressed slowly until 1867, when the B&P was purchased by one of the two increasingly dominant Northeastern rail systems of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and its ally, the Northern Central Railway (NCRY) which ran from Baltimore north into Pennsylvania first to York and then into the state capital at Harrisburg on the Susquehanna River. The PRR at the time had access to Baltimore via its own lines (the NCRY from the north and the Philadelphia, Baltimore & Washington Railroad from the northeast), and used the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B&O) and its Washington Branch line to continue southwest to the national capital at Washington, D.C.. The PRR and B&O had trouble getting along, but Maryland refused to grant a charter to end the B&O's monopoly on Baltimore-Washington travel. However, the Baltimore and Potomac charter allowed exactly that, via the clause that allowed branches; all the PRR had to do was take the line within of Washington. Later the U.S. Congress granted a charter for the section constructed in Washington on February 5, 1867.\n\nThus the new Baltimore-Washington line opened on July 2, 1872, and the required \"main line\" to Popes Creek on the Potomac River, immediately relegated to branch status, opened on January 1, 1873. The final section, the Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel under Winchester Street and Wilson Street in Baltimore, opened on June 29, 1873, connecting the line to the PRR's Northern Central Railway (north to Harrisburg) and Baltimore's new Union Station. That year or the next, the Union Railroad also opened, extending the line eastward through another tunnel to the PRR's other Baltimore line, the Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad (PW&B) northeast to Delaware and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe first B&P station in Washington was a simple wood frame structure. A more substantial brick and stone building opened in 1873 at the southwest corner of Sixth Street and B Street NW (later renamed Constitution Avenue). This is the present site of the West Building of the National Gallery of Art, on the National Mall. The station was built over the old Washington City Canal, which complicated the construction of the foundation. Tracks ran south from the station along Sixth Street to a wye junction at Sixth Street SW, Maryland Avenue SW, and Virginia Avenue SW.\n\nOn November 1, 1902, B&P was consolidated with PW&B to form the Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad (PB&W), also controlled by PRR.\n\nThe Washington Terminal Company and its Union Station opened in 1907, serving the PB&W, the B&O and several other railroads. All PB&W passenger trains from Baltimore were diverted to a new alignment called the Magruder Branch, splitting from the old one at Landover and running west to run parallel with the B&O Washington Branch on the approach to the new station.\n\nSince then, the line has passed under control of Penn Central in 1968, followed by Conrail and Amtrak. Since the breakup of Conrail in 1999, Norfolk Southern has provided freight service over the main line. However, the Pope's Creek Subdivision (originally part of the chartered main line) is operated by CSX Transportation.\n\nThe Catonsville Short Line Railroad opened in 1884 and was immediately leased by the Baltimore & Potomac. This provided a short branch from just south of Baltimore to Catonsville.\n\nThe 48.7-mile (78.4 km) branch to Popes Creek was part of the original chartered main line, but from opening it was operated as a branch of the main line from the junction at Bowie. The main line from Bowie to Washington, a distance of 17.1 miles (27.5 km), was provided for in the charter as a branch.\n\nThere was a passenger and freight station at Collington on the Southern Maryland Line. Today, a 5,200-foot railroad siding is all that remains of this stop, although the spur is still in use. It is located at milepost 3.0 on the spur, just south of where the spur crosses under Maryland Route 450 near Maryland Route 197.\n\n"}

Garapan, as a census-designated place, has an area of 1.2 km² and a population of 3,588 (census of population, 2000).\n\nGarapan is located on Saipan's west coast and is home to the majority of the island's major hotels and the American Memorial Park, which honors American soldiers who died during the Battle of Saipan. Micro Beach, one of Saipan's more famous beaches, sits adjacent to the American Memorial Park and boasts turquoise waters upon a fine white, sandy shore.\n\nNumerous shops, restaurants, and one of the CNMI's largest elementary schools, Garapan Elementary School, is located here. A popular tourist attraction, Paseo De Marianas (historically known as \"Hotel Street\"), is also located in Garapan.\n\nOne of the several churches on the island, Kristo Rai Church, is located in Garapan, just north of the Horiguchi Building.\n\nPrior to its dissolution, Pacific Island Aviation was headquartered on the second floor of the Cabrera Center in Garapan.\n\nGarapan was a minor settlement during the Spanish colonial period of Saipan, and a location to which the Chamorros forcibly relocated from other islands in the Northern Marianas were housed before being transferred to Guam. The forced transfer of the Chamorros to Guam was completed by 1749 and Saipan was recorded as uninhabited. The village name of Garapan derived from the Refaluwasch(Carolinian)name of Arabwal(Gharabwan), so named for the vine with heart-shaped leaves found along the beach there by a group from Satawal who arrived here to settle around the year 1815. Between the years 1865 and 1869, the Hispanicized descendants of the Chamorros that were forcibly relocated to Guam started a settlement in this area, although apart from the Refaluwasch (Carolinian) community. During the German colonial period (1898-1914) a road was built connecting Garapan with Tanapag. The village was selected by the Empire of Japan when Japan acquired the South Seas Mandate from the League of Nations in 1920 to be the capital of their holdings in the Mariana Islands. Under the Nan’yō Kōhatsu Kabushiki Kaisha, the town rapidly developed, with a school, hospital, courthouse, bank, newspaper offices, cinema, and numerous public buildings constructed. By the mid-1930s, Garapan had a population of approximately 14,000 people, mostly Japanese and ethnic Koreans, Taiwanese and Okinawans, and was nicknamed \"Tokyo of the South Seas\".\n\nThis prosperity came to an abrupt end in World War II. During the Battle of Saipan in 1944, Garapan was totally destroyed, and thousands of its civilian inhabitants were killed. The survivors were forcibly repatriated to the Japanese home islands after the surrender of Japan and the ruins of Garapan remained unpopulated until the late 1960s and 1970s, when the area was redeveloped into large resort hotels and condominiums for the tourist industry. Some of the few remaining structures from the Japanese period, such as the Nan'yo-cho Saipan Hospital, are preserved on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Public School System\n\nPrivate schools:\n\n"}

He served as one of the delegates from the Church of England to the Synod of Dort.\n\nHe was born at Bishop Middleham, County Durham. He was a scholar of Christ's College, Cambridge, where in 1592 he was admitted B.A. In 1595 he was elected to a fellowship at Emmanuel, and in the following year proceeded M.A. In 1599 he was chosen a Fellow of the new Sidney Sussex College.\n\nWilliam Perkins entrusted to him for publication his treatise, \"Problema de Romanae Fidei ementito Catholicismo\"; Ward published it with a preface addressed to James I, to whom he was shortly afterwards appointed chaplain. Ward was one of the scholars involved with the translation and preparation of the King James version of the Bible. He served in the \"Second Cambridge Company\" charged with translating the \"Apocrypha\". During this time he made the acquaintance of James Ussher, whom he assisted in patristic researches.\n\nIn 1610, Sidney elected him to the mastership of the college and he was created D.D., having been admitted B.D. in 1603. He was now recognised as a moderate with Calvinist views, strongly attached to the Church of England; Thomas Fuller, who was his pupil at Sidney Sussex College, found him consistent. In 1615 Ward was made prebendary of Wells Cathedral, and also archdeacon of Taunton. On 21 February 1618 he was appointed prebendary of York, and in the following year was one of the English delegates to the synod of Dort. Letters addressed to him there from Thomas Wallis, Gerard Herbert, Joseph Hall, and Arthur Lake survive. Simon Episcopius found him the most learned member of the synod.\n\nIn 1623 he was appointed Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity in the university. He was one of the licensers of George Carleton's book against Richard Montagu's 'Appeale'; it was later suppressed by William Laud; and he appears to have himself taken part in the attack on Montagu, whose chaplain he had at one time been. He concurred in the censure of a sermon preached at Great St. Mary's by one Adams in 1627, advocating the practice of confession (Canterburies Doom, pp. 159–92); and when Isaac Dorislaus was appointed lecturer on history at Cambridge, he welcomed him. He appears also to have written in reply to the anti-Calvinistic treatise \"God's Love to Mankind\" by Henry Mason and Samuel Hoard. His college chapel remained unconsecrated.\n\nWhen the First English Civil War broke out his sense of duty, as involved in his sworn allegiance to the crown, would not allow him to take the Solemn League and Covenant, and in consequence he became obnoxious to the presbyterian majority. In 1643, along with many others, he was imprisoned in St. John's College until, his health giving way, he was permitted to retire to his own college. He was attended during his last days by Seth Ward. On 30 August 1643, while attending the chapel service, he was seized with illness, an attack which terminated fatally on the 7th of the following September. His obsequies were formally celebrated on 30 November, when a funeral oration was pronounced in Great St. Mary's by Henry Molle, the public orator, and a sermon preached by Ward's friend and admirer, Ralph Brownrig. He was interred in the college chapel.\n\nOther pupils were Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester and Richard Holdsworth, and he supported both Abraham Wheelocke and Simon Birkbeck. Other friends included John Williams, John Davenant, Thomas James, and Sir Simonds D'Ewes.\n\nIn 2015, Professor Jeffrey Alan Miller of Montclair State University announced the discovery of an early draft manuscript of a portion of the King James Bible, specifically 1 Esdras and Wisdom 3-4, among Ward's papers in the archives of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. Written in Ward's own handwriting and dating from 1604 to 1608, the manuscript shows Ward crafting portions of the Apocrypha, with translation notes in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. The manuscript sheds light on the translation process used for the King James Bible, notably that many portions were at least initially translated independently and not collaboratively as was originally thought.\n\nPrior to Miller, the existence of Ward's draft of 1 Esdras had been previously noted in the early nineteenth century by the librarian and scholar Henry Todd (priest), in his biography of Brian Walton (bishop). Todd writes, in the course of his survey of British Biblical scholarship in the period before Walton: \"Dr \"Samuel Ward\", the Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity at Cambridge, was the constant correspondent of Archbishop Usher upon subjects of biblical and oriental criticism. Among his curious Adversaria in the library of Sidney College, of which he was Master, there remain the proof of his attention in translating the first book of Esdras, which probably was the sole part of the Apocrypha assigned to him; and a collation of ancient Versions upon the beginning of Genesis.\" Todd, however, never specified the exact notebook in question that contained Ward's draft of 1 Esdras. He also overlooked the existence in the same notebook of the draft of Wisdom 3-4.\n\nA complete digital version of the manuscript is available on Cambridge Digital Library.\n\nHis works are:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2112390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112390", "title": "History of Newcastle upon Tyne", "text": "History of Newcastle upon Tyne\n\nThe history of Newcastle upon Tyne dates back almost 2,000 years, during which it has been controlled by the Romans, the Angles and the Norsemen amongst others. Originally known by its Roman name \"Pons Aelius\", the name \"Newcastle\" has been used since the Norman conquest of England. Due to its prime location on the River Tyne, the town developed greatly during the Middle Ages and it was to play a major role in the Industrial Revolution, being granted city status in 1882. Today, the city is a major retail, commercial and cultural centre.\n\nThe history of Newcastle dates from about AD 120, when the Romans built the first bridge to cross the River Tyne at that point. The bridge was called Pons Aelius or 'Bridge of Aelius', Aelius being the family name of Roman Emperor Hadrian, who was responsible for the Roman wall built across northern England along the Tyne–Solway gap. Hadrian's Wall ran through present-day Newcastle, with stretches of wall and turrets visible along the West Road, and at a temple in Benwell. Traces of a milecastle were found on Westgate Road, midway between Clayton Street and Grainger Street, and it is likely that the course of the wall corresponded to present-day Westgate Road. The course of the wall can be traced eastwards to the Segedunum Roman fort at Wallsend, with the fort of Arbeia down-river at the mouth of the Tyne, on the south bank in what is now South Shields. The Tyne was then a wider, shallower river at this point and it is thought that the bridge was probably about long, made of wood and supported on stone piers. It is probable that it was sited near the current Swing Bridge, due to the fact that Roman artefacts were found there during the building of the latter bridge. Hadrian himself probably visited the site in 122. A shrine was set up on the completed bridge in 123 by the 6th Legion, with two altars to Neptune and Oceanus respectively. The two altars were subsequently found in the river and are on display in the Great North Museum in Newcastle.\n\nThe Romans built a stone-walled fort in 150 to protect the river crossing which was at the foot of the Tyne Gorge, and this took the name of the bridge so that the whole settlement was known as \"Pons Aelius\". The fort was situated on a rocky outcrop overlooking the new bridge, on the site of the present Castle Keep. Pons Aelius is last mentioned in 400, in a Roman document listing all of the Roman military outposts. It is likely that nestling in the shadow of the fort would have been a small \"vicus\", or village. Unfortunately, no buildings have been detected; only a few pieces of flagging. It is clear that there was a Roman cemetery near Clavering Place, behind the Central station, as a number of Roman coffins and sarcophagi have been unearthed there.\n\nDespite the presence of the bridge, the settlement of Pons Aelius was not particularly important among the northern Roman settlements. The most important stations were those on the highway of Dere Street running from Eboracum (York) through Corstopitum (Corbridge) and to the lands north of the Wall. Corstopitum, being a major arsenal and supply centre, was much larger and more populous than Pons Aelius.\n\nThe Angles arrived in the North-East of England in about 500 and may have landed on the Tyne. There is no evidence of an Anglo-Saxon settlement on or near the site of Pons Aelius during the Anglo-Saxon age. The bridge probably survived and there may well have been a small village at the northern end, but no evidence survives. At that time the region was dominated by two kingdoms, Bernicia, north of the Tees and ruled from Bamburgh, and Deira, south of the Tees and ruled from York. Bernicia and Deira combined to form the kingdom of Northanhymbra (Northumbria) early in the 7th century. There were three local kings who held the title of Bretwalda – 'Lord of Britain', Edwin of Deira (627–632), Oswald of Bernicia (633–641) and Oswy of Northumbria (641–658). The 7th century became known as the 'Golden Age of Northumbria', when the area was a beacon of culture and learning in Europe. The greatness of this period was based on its generally Christian culture and resulted in the Lindisfarne Gospels amongst other treasures. The Tyne valley was dotted with monasteries, with those at Monkwearmouth, Hexham and Jarrow being the most famous. Bede, who was based at Jarrow, wrote of a royal estate, known as \"Ad Murum\", 'at the Wall', from the sea. It is thought that this estate may have been in what is now Newcastle. At some unknown time, the site of Newcastle came to be known as Monkchester. The reason for this title is unknown, as we are unaware of any specific monasteries at the site, and Bede made no reference to it. In 875 Halfdan Ragnarsson, the Danish Viking conqueror of York, led an army that attacked and pillaged various monasteries in the area, and it is thought that Monkchester was also pillaged at this time. Little more was heard of it until the coming of the Normans.\n\nAfter the arrival of William the Conqueror in England in 1066, the whole of England was quickly subjected to Norman rule. However, in Northumbria there was great resistance to the Normans, and in 1069 the newly appointed Norman Earl of Northumbria, Robert de Comines and 700 of his men were killed by the local population at Durham. The Northumbrians then marched on York, but William was able to suppress the uprising. That same year, a second uprising occurred when a Danish fleet landed in the Humber. The Northumbrians again attacked York and destroyed the garrison there. William was again able to suppress the uprising, but this time he took revenge. He laid waste to the whole of the Midlands and the land from York to the Tees. In 1080, William Walcher, the Norman bishop of Durham and his followers were brutally murdered at Gateshead. This time Odo, bishop of Bayeux, William's half brother, devastated the land between the Tees and the Tweed. This was known as the ‘Harrying of the North’. This devastation is reflected in the Domesday Book. The destruction had such an effect that the North remained poor and backward at least until Tudor times and perhaps until the Industrial Revolution. Newcastle suffered in this respect with the rest of the North.\n\nIn 1080 William sent his eldest son, Robert Curthose, north to defend the kingdom against the Scots. After his campaign, he moved to Monkchester and began the building of a 'New Castle'. This was of the \"motte-and-bailey\" type of construction, a wooden tower on top of an earthen mound (motte), surrounded by a moat and wooden stockade (bailey). It was this castle that gave Newcastle its name. In 1095 the Earl of Northumbria, Robert de Mowbray, rose up against the king, William Rufus and Rufus sent an army north to recapture the castle. From then on the castle became crown property and was an important base from which the king could control the northern barons. The Northumbrian earldom was abolished and a Sheriff of Northumberland was appointed to administer the region. In 1091 the parish church of St Nicholas was consecrated on the site of the present Anglican cathedral, close by the bailey of the new castle. The church is believed to have been a wooden building on stone footings.\n\nNot a trace of the tower or mound of the motte and bailey castle remains now. Henry II replaced it with a rectangular stone keep, which was built between 1172 and 1177 at a cost of £1,444. A stone bailey, in the form of a triangle, replaced the previous wooden one. The great outer gateway to the castle, called 'the Black Gate’, was built later, between 1247 and 1250, in the reign of Henry III. There were at that time no town walls and when attacked by the Scots, the townspeople had to crowd into the bailey for safety. It is probable that the new castle acted as a magnet for local merchants because of the safety it provided. This in turn would help to expand trade in the town. At this time wool, skins and lead were being exported, whilst alum, pepper and ginger were being imported from France and Flanders.\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, Newcastle was England's northern fortress, the centre for assembled armies. The Border war against Scotland lasted intermittently for several centuries – possibly the longest border war ever waged. During the civil war between Stephen and Matilda, David 1st of Scotland and his son were granted Cumbria and Northumberland respectively, so that for a period from 1139 to 1157, Newcastle was effectively in Scottish hands. It is believed that during this period, King David may have built the church of St Andrew and the Benedictine nunnery in Newcastle. However, King Stephen's successor, Henry II was strong enough to take back the Earldom of Northumbria from Malcolm IV.\n\nThe Scots king William the Lion was imprisoned in Newcastle, in 1174, after being captured at the Battle of Alnwick. Edward I brought the Stone of Scone and William Wallace south through the town and Newcastle was successfully defended against the Scots three times during the 14th century.\n\nAround 1200, stone-faced, clay-filled jetties were starting to project into the river, an indication that trade was increasing in Newcastle. As the Roman roads continued to deteriorate, sea travel was gaining in importance. By 1275 Newcastle was the sixth largest wool exporting port in England. The principal exports at this time were wool, timber, coal, millstones, dairy produce, fish, salt and hides. Much of the developing trade was with the Baltic countries and Germany. Most of the Newcastle merchants were situated near the river, below the Castle. The earliest known charter was dated 1175 in the reign of Henry II, giving the townspeople some control over their town. In 1216 King John granted Newcastle a mayor and also allowed the formation of guilds (known as Mysteries). These were cartels formed within different trades, which restricted trade to guild members. There were initially twelve guilds. Coal was being exported from Newcastle by 1250, and by 1350 the burgesses received a royal licence to export coal. This licence to export coal was jealously guarded by the Newcastle burgesses, and they tried to prevent any one else on the Tyne from exporting coal except through Newcastle. The burgesses similarly tried to prevent fish from being sold anywhere else on the Tyne except Newcastle. This led to conflicts with Gateshead and South Shields.\n\nIn 1265, the town was granted permission to impose a 'Wall Tax' or Murage, to pay for the construction of a fortified wall to enclose the town and protect it from Scottish invaders. The town walls were not completed until early in the 14th century. They were two miles (3 km) long, thick and high. They had six main gates, as well as some smaller gates, and had 17 towers. The land within the walls was divided almost equally by the Lort Burn, which flowed southwards and joined the Tyne to the east of the Castle. The town began to expand north of the Castle and west of the Lort Burn with various markets being set up within the walls.\n\nIn 1400 Henry IV granted a new charter, creating a County corporate which separated the town, but not the Castle, from the county of Northumberland and recognised it as a \"county of itself\" with a right to have a sheriff of its own. The burgesses were now allowed to choose six aldermen who, with the mayor would be justices of the peace. The mayor and sheriff were allowed to hold borough courts in the Guildhall.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages a number of religious houses were established within the walls: the first of these was the Benedictine nunnery of St Bartholomew founded in 1086 near the present-day Nun Street. Both David I of Scotland and Henry I of England were benefactors of the religious house. Nothing of the nunnery remains now.\n\nThe friary of Blackfriars, Newcastle (Dominican) was established in 1239. These were also known as the Preaching Friars or Shod Friars, because they wore sandals, as opposed to other orders. The friary was situated in the present-day Friars Street. In 1280 the order was granted royal permission to make a postern in the town walls to communicate with their gardens outside the walls. On 19 June 1334, Edward Baliol, King of Scotland, did homage to King Edward III, on behalf of the kingdom of Scotland, in the church of the friary. Much of the original buildings of the friary still exist, mainly because, after the dissolution of the monasteries the friary of Blackfriars was rented out by the corporation to nine of the local trade guilds.\n\nThe friary of Whitefriars (Carmelite) was established in 1262. The order was originally housed on the Wall Knoll in Pandon, but in 1307 it took over the buildings of another order, which went out of existence, the Friars of the Sac. The land, which had originally been given by Robert the Bruce, was situated in the present-day Hanover Square, behind the Central station. Nothing of the friary remains now.\n\nThe friary of Austinfriars (Augustinian) was established in 1290. The friary was on the site where the Holy Jesus Hospital was built in 1682. The friary was traditionally the lodging place of English kings whenever they visited or passed through Newcastle. In 1503 Princess Margaret, eldest daughter of Henry VII of England stayed two days at the friary on her way to join her new husband James IV of Scotland.\n\nThe friary of Greyfriars (Franciscans) was established in 1274. The friary was in the present-day area between Pilgrim Street, Grey Street, Market Street and High Chare. Nothing of the original buildings remains.\n\nThe friary of the Order of the Holy Trinity, also known as the Trinitarians, was established in 1360. The order devoted a third of its income to buying back captives of the Saracens, during the Crusades. Their house was on the Wall Knoll, in Pandon, to the east of the city, but within the walls. Wall Knoll had previously been occupied by the White Friars until they moved to new premises in 1307.\n\nAll of the above religious houses were closed in about 1540, when Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries.\n\nAn important street running through Newcastle at the time was Pilgrim Street, running northwards inside the walls and leading to the Pilgrim Gate on the north wall. The street still exists today.\n\nThe Scottish border wars continued for much of the 16th century, so that during that time, Newcastle was often threatened with invasion by the Scots, but also remained important as a border stronghold against them.\n\nDuring the Reformation begun by Henry VIII in 1536, the five Newcastle friaries and the single nunnery were dissolved and the land was sold to the Corporation and to rich merchants. At this time there were fewer than 60 inmates of the religious houses in Newcastle. The convent of Blackfriars was leased to nine craft guilds to be used as their headquarters. This probably explains why it is the only one of the religious houses whose building survives to the present day. The priories at Tynemouth and Durham were also dissolved, thus ending the long-running rivalry between Newcastle and the church for control of trade on the Tyne. A little later, the property of the nunnery of St Bartholomew and of Grey Friars were bought by Robert Anderson, who had the buildings demolished to build his grand Newe House (also known as Anderson Place).\n\nWith the gradual decline of the Scottish border wars the town walls were allowed to decline as well as the castle. By 1547, about 10,000 people were living in Newcastle. At the beginning of the 16th century exports of wool from Newcastle were more than twice the value of exports of coal, but during the century coal exports continued to increase.\n\nUnder Edward VI, John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, sponsored an act allowing Newcastle to annexe Gateshead as its suburb. The main reason for this was to allow the Newcastle Hostmen, who controlled the export of Tyne coal, to get their hands on the Gateshead coal mines, previously controlled by the Bishop of Durham. However, when Mary I came to power, Dudley met his downfall and the decision was reversed. The Reformation allowed private access to coal mines previously owned by Tynemouth and Durham priories and as a result coal exports increase dramatically, from 15,000 tons in 1500 to 35,000 tons in 1565, and to 400,000 tons in 1625.\n\nThe plague visited Newcastle four times during the 16th century, in 1579 when 2,000 people died, in 1589 when 1700 died, in 1595 and finally in 1597.\n\nIn 1600 Elizabeth I granted Newcastle a charter for an exclusive body of electors, the right to elect the mayor and burgesses. The charter also gave the Hostmen exclusive rights to load coal at any point on the Tyne. The Hostmen developed as an exclusive group within the Merchant Adventurers who had been incorporated by a charter in 1547.\n\nIn 1636 there was a serious outbreak of bubonic plague in Newcastle. There had been several previous outbreaks of the disease over the years, but this was the most serious. It is thought to have arrived from the Netherlands via ships that were trading between the Tyne and that country. It first appeared in the lower part of the town near the docks but gradually spread to all parts of the town. As the disease gained hold the authorities took measures to control it by boarding up any properties that contained infected persons, meaning that whole families were locked up together with the infected family members. Other infected persons were put in huts outside the town walls and left to die. Plague pits were dug next to the town's four churches and outside the town walls to receive the bodies in mass burials. Over the course of the outbreak 5,631 deaths were recorded out of an estimated population of 12,000, a death rate of 47%.\n\nIn 1637 Charles I tried to raise money by doubling the 'voluntary' tax on coal in return for allowing the Newcastle Hostmen to regulate production and fix prices. This caused outrage amongst the London importers and the East Anglian shippers. Both groups decided to boycott Tyne coal and as a result forced Charles to reverse his decision in 1638.\n\nIn 1640 during the Second Bishops' War, the Scots successfully invaded Newcastle. The occupying army demanded £850 per day from the Corporation to billet the Scottish troops. Trade from the Tyne ground to a halt during the occupation. The Scots left in 1641 after receiving a Parliamentary pardon and a £4,000,000 loan from the town.\n\nIn 1642 the English Civil War began. King Charles realised the value of the Tyne coal trade and therefore garrisoned Newcastle. A Royalist was appointed as governor. At that time, Newcastle and King's Lynn were the only important seaports to support the crown. In 1644 Parliament blockaded the Tyne to prevent the king from receiving revenue from the Tyne coal trade. Coal exports fell from 450,000 to 3,000 tons and London suffered a hard winter without fuel. Parliament encouraged the coal trade from the Wear to try to replace that lost from Newcastle but that was not enough to make up for the lost Tyneside tonnage.\n\nIn 1644 the Scots crossed the border. Newcastle strengthened its defences in preparation. The Scottish army, with 40,000 troops, besieged Newcastle for three months until the garrison of 1,500 surrendered. During the siege, the Scots bombarded the walls with their artillery, situated in Gateshead and Castle Leazes. The Scottish commander threatened to destroy the steeple of St Nicholas church by gunfire if the mayor, Sir John Marley, did not surrender the town. The mayor responded by placing Scottish prisoners that they had captured in the steeple, so saving it from destruction. The town walls were finally breached by a combination of artillery and sapping. In gratitude for this defence, Charles gave Newcastle the motto 'Fortiter Defendit Triumphans' to be added to its coat of arms. The Scottish army occupied Northumberland and Durham for two years. The coal taxes had to pay for the Scottish occupation. In 1645 Charles surrendered to the Scots and was imprisoned in Newcastle for nine months. After the Civil War the coal trade on the Tyne soon picked up and exceeded its pre-war levels.\n\nA new Guildhall was completed on the Sandhill next to the river in 1655, replacing an earlier facility damaged by fire in 1639, and became the meeting place of Newcastle Town Council. In 1681 the Hospital of the Holy Jesus was built partly on the site of the Austin Friars. The Guildhall and Holy Jesus Hospital still exist.\n\nCharles II tried to impose a charter on Newcastle to give the king the right to appoint the mayor, sheriff, recorder and town clerk. Charles died before the charter came into effect. In 1685, James II tried to replace Corporation members with named Catholics. However, James' mandate was suspended in 1689 after the Glorious Revolution welcoming William of Orange. In 1689, after the fall of James II, the people of Newcastle tore down his bronze equestrian statue in Sandhill and tossed it into the Tyne. The bronze was later used to make bells for All Saints Church.\n\nIn 1689 the Lort Burn was covered over. At this time it was an open sewer. The channel followed by the Lort Burn became the present day Dean Street. At that time, the centre of Newcastle was still the Sandhill area, with many merchants living along the Close or on the Side. The path of the main road through Newcastle ran from the single Tyne bridge, through Sandhill to the Side, a narrow street which climbed steeply on the north-east side of the castle hill until it reached the higher ground alongside St Nicholas' Church. As Newcastle developed, the Side became lined with buildings with projecting upper stories, so that the main street through Newcastle was a narrow, congested, steep thoroughfare.\n\nIn 1701 the Keelmen's Hospital was built in the Sandgate area of the city, using funds provided by the keelmen. The building still stands today.\n\nIn the 18th century, Newcastle was the country's largest print centre after London, Oxford and Cambridge, and the Literary and Philosophical Society of 1793, with its erudite debates and large stock of books in several languages predated the London Library by half a century.\n\nIn 1715, during the Jacobite rising in favour of the Old Pretender, an army of Jacobite supporters marched on Newcastle. Many of the Northumbrian gentry joined the rebels. The citizens prepared for its arrival by arresting Jacobite supporters and accepting 700 extra recruits into the local militia. The gates of the city were closed against the rebels. This proved enough to delay an attack until reinforcements arrived forcing the rebel army to move across to the west coast. The rebels finally surrendered at Preston.\n\nIn 1745, during a second Jacobite rising in favour of the Young Pretender, a Scottish army crossed the border led by Bonnie Prince Charlie. Once again Newcastle prepared by arresting Jacobite supporters and inducting 800 volunteers into the local militia. The town walls were strengthened, most of the gates were blocked up and some 200 cannon were deployed. 20,000 regulars were billeted on the Town Moor. These preparations were enough to force the rebel army to travel south via the west coast. They were eventually defeated at Culloden in 1746.\n\nNewcastle's actions during the 1715 rising in resisting the rebels and declaring for George I, in contrast to the rest of the region, is the most likely source of the nickname 'Geordie', applied to people from Tyneside, or more accurately Newcastle. Another theory, however, is that the name 'Geordie' came from the inventor of the Geordie lamp, George Stephenson. It was a type of safety lamp used in mining, but was not invented until 1815. Apparently the term 'German Geordie' was in common use during the 18th century. \n\nA lying-in hospital was established in Newcastle in 1760. The city's first public hospital for mentally ill patients, Wardens Close Lunatic Hospital was opened in October 1767.\n\nIn 1771 a flood swept away much of the bridge at Newcastle. The bridge had been built in 1250 and repaired after a flood in 1339. The bridge supported various houses and three towers and an old chapel. A blue stone was placed in the middle of the bridge to mark the boundary between Newcastle and the Palatinate of Durham. A temporary wooden bridge had to be built, and this remained in use until 1781, when a new stone bridge was completed. The new bridge consisted of nine arches. In 1801, because of the pressure of traffic, the bridge had to be widened.\n\nA permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of Fenham Barracks in 1806. The facilities at the Castle for holding assizes, which had been condemned for their inconvenience and unhealthiness, were replaced when the Moot Hall opened in August 1812.\n\nPresent-day Newcastle owes much of its architecture to the work of the builder Richard Grainger, aided by architects John Dobson, Thomas Oliver, John and Benjamin Green and others. In 1834 Grainger won a competition to produce a new plan for central Newcastle. He put this plan into effect using the above architects as well as architects employed in his own office. Grainger and Oliver had already built Leazes Terrace, Leazes Crescent and Leazes Place between 1829 and 1834. Grainger and Dobson had also built the Royal Arcade at the foot of Pilgrim Street between 1830 and 1832. The most ambitious project covered 12 acres in central Newcastle, on the site of Newe House (also called Anderson Place). Grainger built three new thoroughfares, Grey Street, Grainger Street and Clayton Street with many connecting streets, as well as the Central Exchange and the Grainger Market. John Wardle and George Walker, working in Grainger's office, designed Clayton Street, Grainger Street and most of Grey Street. Dobson designed the Grainger Market and much of the east side of Grey Street. John and Benjamin Green designed the Theatre Royal at the top of Grey Street, where Grainger placed the column of Grey's Monument as a focus for the whole scheme. Grey Street is considered to be one of the finest streets in the country, with its elegant curve. Unfortunately most of old Eldon Square was demolished in the 1960s in the name of progress. The Royal Arcade met a similar fate.\n\nIn 1849 a new bridge was built across the river at Newcastle. This was the High Level Bridge, designed by Robert Stephenson, and slightly up river from the existing bridge. The bridge was designed to carry road and rail traffic across the Tyne Gorge on two decks with rail traffic on the upper deck and road traffic on the lower. The new bridge meant that traffic could pass through Newcastle without having to negotiate the steep, narrow Side, as had been necessary for centuries. The bridge was opened by Queen Victoria, who one year later opened the new Central Station, designed by John Dobson. Trains were now able to cross the river, directly into the centre of Newcastle and carry on up to Scotland. The Army Riding School was also completed in 1849.\n\nIn 1854 a large fire started on the Gateshead quayside and an explosion caused it to spread across the river to the Newcastle quayside. A huge conflagration amongst the narrow alleys, or 'chares', destroyed the homes of 800 families as well as many business premises. The narrow alleys that had been destroyed were replaced by streets containing blocks of modern offices.\n\nIn 1863 the Town Hall in St Nicholas Square replaced the Guildhall as the meeting place of Newcastle Town Council.\n\nIn 1876 the low level bridge was replaced by a new bridge known as the Swing Bridge, so called because the bridge was able to swing horizontally on a central axis and allow ships to pass on either side. This meant that for the first time sizeable ships could pass up-river beyond Newcastle. The bridge was built and paid for by William Armstrong, a local arms manufacturer, who needed to have warships access his Elswick arms factory to fit armaments to them. The Swing Bridge's rotating mechanism is adapted from the cannon mounts developed in Armstrong's arms works. In 1882 the Elswick works began to build ships as well as to arm them. The Barrack Road drill hall was completed in 1890.\n\nIn the 19th century, shipbuilding and heavy engineering were central to the city's prosperity; and the city was a powerhouse of the Industrial Revolution. Newcastle's development as a major city owed most to its central role in the production and export of coal. The phrase \"taking coals to Newcastle\" was first recorded in 1538; it proverbially denotes bringing a particular commodity to a place that has more than enough of it already.\n\nInnovation in Newcastle and surrounding areas included the following:\n\nThe following major industries developed in Newcastle or its surrounding area:\n\nA small glass industry existed in Newcastle from the mid-15th century. In 1615 restrictions were put on the use of wood for manufacturing glass. It was found that glass could be manufactured using the local coal, and so a glassmaking industry grew up on Tyneside. Huguenot glassmakers came over from France as refugees from persecution and set up glasshouses in the Skinnerburn area of Newcastle. Eventually, glass production moved to the Ouseburn area of Newcastle. In 1684 the Dagnia family, Sephardic Jewish emigrants from Altare, arrived in Newcastle from Stourbridge and established glasshouses along the Close, to manufacture high quality flint glass. The glass manufacturers used sand ballast from the boats arriving in the river as the main raw material. The glassware was then exported in collier brigs. The period from 1730 to 1785 was the highpoint of Newcastle glass manufacture, when the local glassmakers produced the 'Newcastle Light Baluster'. The glassmaking industry still exists in the west end of the city with local Artist and Glassmaker Jane Charles carrying on over four hundred years of hot glass blowing in Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nIn 1823 George Stephenson and his son Robert established the world's first locomotive factory near Forth Street in Newcastle. Here they built locomotives for the Stockton and Darlington Railway and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, as well as many others. It was here that the famous locomotive Rocket was designed and manufactured in preparation for the Rainhill Trials. Apart from building locomotives for the British market, the Newcastle works also produced locomotives for Europe and America. The Forth Street works continued to build locomotives until 1960.\n\nIn 1296 a wooden, long galley was constructed at the mouth of the Lort Burn in Newcastle, as part of a twenty-ship order from the king. The ship cost £205, and is the earliest record of shipbuilding in Newcastle. However the rise of the Tyne as a shipbuilding area was due to the need for collier brigs for the coal export trade. These wooden sailing ships were usually built locally, establishing local expertise in building ships. As ships changed from wood to steel, and from sail to steam, the local shipbuilding industry changed to build the new ships. Although shipbuilding was carried out up and down both sides of the river, the two main areas for building ships in Newcastle were Elswick, to the west, and Walker, to the east. By 1800 Tyneside was the third largest producer of ships in Britain. Unfortunately, after the Second World War, lack of modernisation and competition from abroad gradually caused the local industry to decline and die.\n\nIn 1847 William Armstrong established a huge factory in Elswick, west of Newcastle. This was initially used to produce hydraulic cranes but subsequently began also to produce guns for both the army and the navy. After the Swing Bridge was built in 1876 allowing ships to pass up river, warships could have their armaments fitted alongside the Elswick works. Armstrong's company took over its industrial rival, Joseph Whitworth of Manchester in 1897.\n\nCharles Algernon Parsons invented the steam turbine and, in 1889, founded his own company C. A. Parsons and Company in Heaton, Newcastle to make steam turbines. Shortly after this, he realised that steam turbines could be used to propel ships and, in 1897, he founded a second company, Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company in Wallsend. It is there that he designed and manufactured Turbinia. Parsons turbines were initially used in warships but soon came to be used in merchant and passenger vessels, including the liner \"Mauretania\" which held the blue riband for the Atlantic crossing until 1929. Parsons' company in Heaton began to make turbo-generators for power stations and supplied power stations all over the world. The Heaton works, reduced in size, remains as part of the Siemens AG industrial giant.\n\nIn 1762 the Maling pottery was founded in Sunderland by French Huguenots, but transferred to Newcastle in 1817. A factory was built in the Ouseburn area of the city. The factory was rebuilt twice, finally occupying a site that was claimed to be the biggest pottery in the world and which had its own railway station. The pottery pioneered use of machines in making potteries as opposed to hand production. In the 1890s the company went up-market and employed in-house designers. The period up to the Second World War was the most profitable with a constant stream of new designs being introduced. However, after the war, production gradually declined and the company closed in 1963.\n\nNewcastle was one of the boroughs reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835: the reformed municipal borough included the parishes of Byker, Elswick, Heaton, Jesmond, Newcastle All Saints, Newcastle St Andew, Newcastle St John, Newcastle St Nicholas, and Westgate. The urban districts of Benwell and Fenham and Walker were added in 1904. In 1935, Newcastle gained Kenton and parts of the parishes of West Brunton, East Denton, Fawdon, Longbenton. The most recent expansion in Newcastle's boundaries took place under the Local Government Act 1972 on 1 April 1974, when Newcastle became a metropolitan borough, also including the urban districts of Gosforth and Newburn, and the parishes of Brunswick, Dinnington, Hazlerigg, North Gosforth and Woolsington from the Castle Ward Rural District, and the village of Westerhope.\n\nMeanwhile Northumberland County Council was formed under the Local Government Act 1888 and benefited from a dedicated meeting place when County Hall was completed in the Castle Garth area of Newcastle in 1910. Following the Local Government Act 1972 County Hall relocated to Morpeth in April 1981.\n\nIn 1925 work began on a new high-level road bridge to span the Tyne Gorge between Newcastle and Gateshead. The capacity of the existing High-Level Bridge and Swing Bridge were being strained to the limit, and an additional bridge had been discussed for a long time. The contract was awarded to the Dorman Long Company and the bridge was finally opened by King George V in 1928. The road deck was above the river and was supported by a steel arch. The new Tyne Bridge quickly became a symbol for Newcastle and Tyneside, and remains so today.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Newcastle was largely spared the horrors inflicted upon other British cities bombed during the Blitz. Although the armaments factories and shipyards along the River Tyne were targeted by the German airforce, they largely escaped unscathed. Manors goods yard and railway terminal, to the east of the city centre, and the suburbs of Jesmond and Heaton suffered bombing during 1941. There were 141 deaths and 587 injuries, a relatively small figure compared to the casualties in other industrial centres of Britain.\n\nIn 1963 the city gained its own university, the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, by act of parliament. A School of Medicine and Surgery had been established in Newcastle in 1834. This eventually developed into a college of medicine attached to Durham University. A college of physical science was also founded and became Armstrong College in 1904. In 1934 the two colleges merged to become King's College, Durham. This remained as part of Durham University until the new university was created in 1963. In 1992 the city gained its second university when Newcastle Polytechnic was granted university status as Northumbria University.\n\nNewcastle City Council moved to the new Newcastle Civic Centre in 1968.\n\nAs heavy industries declined in the second half of the 20th century, large sections of the city centre were demolished along with many areas of slum housing. The leading political figure in the city during the 1960s was T. Dan Smith who oversaw a massive building programme of highrise housing estates and authorised the demolition of a quarter of the Georgian Grainger Town to make way for Eldon Square Shopping Centre. Smith's control in Newcastle collapsed when it was exposed that he had used public contracts to advantage himself and his business associates and for a time Newcastle became a byword for civic corruption as depicted in the films \"Get Carter\" and \"Stormy Monday\" and in the television series \"Our Friends in the North\". However, much of the historic Grainger Town area survived and was, for the most part, fully restored in the late 1990s. Northumberland Street, initially the A1, was gradually closed to traffic from the 1970s and completely pedestrianised by 1998.\n\nIn 1978 a new rapid transport system, the Metro, was built, linking the Tyneside area. The system opened in August 1980. A new bridge was built to carry the Metro across the river between Gateshead and Newcastle. This was the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, commonly known as the Metro Bridge. Eventually the Metro system was extended to reach Newcastle Airport in 1991, and in 2002 the Metro system was extended to the nearby city of Sunderland.\n\nAs the 20th century progressed, trade on the Newcastle and Gateshead quaysides gradually declined, until by the 1980s both sides of the river were looking rather derelict. Shipping company offices had closed along with offices of firms related to shipping. There were also derelict warehouses lining the riverbank. Local government produced a master plan to re-develop the Newcastle quayside and this was begun in the 1990s. New offices, restaurants, bars and residential accommodation were built and the area has changed in the space of a few years into a vibrant area, partially returning the focus of Newcastle to the riverside, where it was in medieval times.\n\nThe Gateshead Millennium Bridge, a foot and cycle bridge, wide and long, was completed in 2001. The road deck is in the form of a curve and is supported by a steel arch. To allow ships to pass, the whole structure, both arch and road-deck, rotates on huge bearings at either end so that the road deck is lifted. The bridge can be said to open and shut like a human eye. It is an important addition to the re-developed quayside area, providing a vital link between the Newcastle and Gateshead quaysides.\n\nToday the city is a vibrant centre for office and retail employment, but just a short distance away there are impoverished inner-city housing estates, in areas originally built to provide affordable housing for employees of the shipyards and other heavy industries that lined the River Tyne. In the 2010s Newcastle City Council began implementing plans to regenerate these depressed areas, such as those along the Ouseburn Valley.\n\n\n\n"}

This is the reproductive method of most fish, amphibians, reptiles, all birds, and the monotremes.\n\nIn traditional usage, most insects (one being \"Culex pipiens\", or the common house mosquito), molluscs, and arachnids are also described as oviparous.\n\nThe traditional modes of reproduction include oviparity, taken to be the ancestral condition, traditionally where either unfertilised oocytes or fertilised eggs are spawned, and viviparity traditionally including any mechanism where young are born live, or where the development of the young is supported by either parent in or on any part of their body.\n\nHowever, the biologist Thierry Lodé recently divided the traditional category of oviparous reproduction into two modes that he named ovuliparity and (true) oviparity respectively. He distinguished the two on the basis of the relationship between the zygote (fertilised egg) and the parents :\n\nIn all but special cases of both ovuliparity and oviparity the overwhelming source of nourishment for the embryo is the yolk material deposited in the egg by the reproductive system of the mother (the vitellogenesis); offspring that depend on yolk in this manner are said to be lecithotrophic (opposed to matrotrophic), which literally means \"feeding on yolk\".\n\nDistinguishing between the definitions of oviparity and ovuliparity necessarily reduces the number of species whose modes of reproduction are classified as oviparous, as they no longer include the ovuliparous species such as most fish, most frogs and many invertebrates. Such classifications are largely for convenience and as such can be important in practice, but speaking loosely in contexts in which the distinction is not relevant, it is common to lump both categories together as \"oviparous\".\n"}

Criminal sanctions can take the form of serious punishment, such as corporal or capital punishment, incarceration, or severe fines. Within the civil law context, sanctions are usually monetary fines, levied against a party to a lawsuit or his/her attorney, for violating rules of procedure, or for abusing the judicial process. The most severe sanction in a civil lawsuit is the involuntary dismissal, with prejudice, of a complaining party's cause of action, or of the responding party's answer. This has the effect of deciding the entire action against the sanctioned party without recourse, except to the degree that an appeal or trial \"de novo\" may be allowed because of reversible error.\n\nAs a noun, the term is usually used in the plural form, even if it only refers to a single event: if a judge fines a party, it is not said that they imposed a sanction, but that they imposed sanctions.\n\nA judge may sanction a party during a legal proceeding, by which it is implied that they impose penalties. In the United States federal court system, certain types of conduct are sanctionable under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nConversely and sometimes confusingly, the word may be used to imply \"approve of,\" especially in an official sense. \"The law sanctions such behavior\" would imply that the behavior spoken of enjoys the specific approval of law.\n\nTo sanction implies make a legal agreement. The word is derived from sanctus, to make holy. A legal agreement or sanction imposes approvals, rules, guidelines and penalties on conduct.\n\nThe Sanction is defined as \"an element associated with an accountability and which corresponds to the consequence resulting from the justification of the realisation (or not) of this accountability.\".\n\n"}

Stradiņš was the first person to use the term \"Third Awakening\" (at the expanded plenum of the Writers' Union of the Latvian SSR in June 1988), opposing those who had begun to call the national revival in the period of glasnost the \"Second\" Awakening (the first being that of the Young Latvians).\n\nBlanks sought to distinguish between the New Current (in Latvian: \"Jaunā strāva\") — a broad and radical socio-economic, political, and cultural movement that lasted from the late 1880s until the 1905 Revolution, led by Rainis and influenced by Marxism — from the more nationalistic direction taken in 1903 by Ernests Rolavs and Miķelis Valters; to Blanks, the 1890s \"could be stricken completely from the history of national thought.\" He saw Rolavs' and Valters' nationalist Latvian Social Democratic Union (in Latvian: \"Sociāldemokratu savienība\"; sometimes abbreviated SDS) — a radical socialist group critical of the cosmopolitanism of the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party (\"Latvijas sociāldemokrātiskā strādnieku partija\"; LSDSP) — as the direct ideological descendants of the Young Latvians. It was the SDS (and especially Valters) that first began to formulate demands for Latvia's political autonomy\n\nStradiņš based his view of the national revival in the 1980s on Blanks, considering the Second Awakening similarly: he viewed the organization of the Latvian riflemen, the activities of the Latvian émigrés in Switzerland, the Latvian refugees' relief committee in Russia, the proclamation of independence and the battles for independence as coming under the heading of the Second Awakening. Less frequently, some have seen the New Current and the 1905 Revolution — and sometimes even the Khrushchev Thaw — as National Awakenings.\n\n"}

It was formed out of the merger between UMIST Students' Association (USA) and University of Manchester Union (UMU) when the parent organisations (UMIST and the Victoria University of Manchester) merged on 1 October 2004.\n\nIt does not have a president, but is instead run by an 8-member executive team who share joint responsibility.\n\nThe current University of Manchester Students' Union Exec Team contains eight full-time sabbatical officers. All have their own areas of responsibility, but share joint responsibility as trustees of the Students' Union. Any student can stand to be an elected member of the Exec Team in the student elections that take place in March. All students are eligible to vote in these elections on-line. The current roles are as follows:\n\n\nThe Steve Biko Building (often referred to simply as the Biko Building, or Students' Union) is the Union's primary building and the home of its administrative offices. The building went under major redevelopment in 2012 which included a renovation of the foyer and meeting rooms, the addition of the new Café and the introduction of a new store and sandwich shop. The building also contains a hairdressers and a print shop. The building is named after anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko.\n\nIn October 2012, the University announced that it would be awarding £4 million to the Students' Union in order to make further building improvements. This is likely to involve the construction of another floor on the Steve Biko building and should be completed by 2018.\n\nThe Barnes Wallis Building, named after Barnes Wallis, is situated on the former UMIST Campus (now North Campus). It originally contained the offices for the UMIST Students'Association. Unlike in the Biko building, the Students' Union does not occupy the whole building but has facilities on the ground floor. In 2013, the Union withdrew from these premises as part of the University of Manchester's Campus Masterplan.\n\nManchester Academy refers to the University of Manchester Students' Union's four concert venues. They are situated on Oxford Road both within and adjacent to the Biko building. 'Manchester Academy' was originally the name of the largest of these venues (see picture), but became an umbrella term for both itself and the Union's other venues in 2003. It has hosted such big names as Ian Brown, Muse, Prince, Kylie Minogue, The Stranglers, Super Furry Animals, Deftones, Pink Floyd, The Cure, The Coral, Blur, Oasis, George Clinton, Nirvana, Manic Street Preachers, The Libertines, The Ramones, Billy Talent, Fightstar, Lost Prophets, Babyshambles, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, Supergrass, It Bites and Death Cab for Cutie.\n\nThere are many student-run activities which involve thousands of students in various roles including media, community volunteering fundraising for charity and over 250 societies.\n\nUniversity of Manchester Students' Union is notable for regularly organising and hosting what is reportedly the largest student-led festival in Europe. This is a triannual event where approximately 6000 students are invited to the Students' Union to enjoy a multi-venue music and arts night utilising rooms throughout the Steve Biko Building and the adjacent Manchester Academy 1 building, to mark the end of most University of Manchester undergraduate exams and a special 'Freshers' edition in September.\n\n\"The Mancunion\" is the University of Manchester's Students' Union's newspaper. It is distributed across the city and has a readership of 20,000. The current Editor-in-chief is Charlie Spargo, the Deputy Editor-in-chief is Marcus Johns, and it has an Editorial Team of around 30 volunteers. The paper has widespread circulation within the Greater Manchester student community and it is believed to have the largest circulation of a student paper in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the past the newspaper has drawn national press coverage, particularly when a secret recording was made of a University of Manchester society in which it was suggested that the Islamist speaker agreed that homosexuals in Britain should be put to death. The publication drew media attention because of both the sensitive matter reported and the use of undercover investigative journalism to obtain the story. Also, when The Sun (United Kingdom) newspaper contacted Student Media outlets asking for photos of students dressed up in offensive costumes at Halloween, the newspaper also reported on this, drawing attention from national media again.\n\nStudent Action is a community volunteering project that sends student volunteers out to work in the local community. In 2010, there were over 2500 active volunteers working anything from 20–300 hours over the year.\n\nManchester RAG is the official fundraising arm of the University of Manchester Students' Union. It is responsible for helping facilitate the fundraising activities of all students in Manchester, and in doing so promoting the personal development of students. Last year Manchester RAG helped University of Manchester students raise £190,000 for a variety of charities, ranging from small community based charities in the North West, to large international development organisations. The vast majority of funds raised come from the many events that Manchester RAG organise throughout the year. Popular events include Jailbreak, a sponsored hitch where participants have to get as far away from Manchester without spending a penny in 30 hours, Bogle, a 55-mile walk around greater Manchester, and Beerfest, a three-day student run beer festival which attracts over 1500 students annually. RAG also runs many 'challenge' events such as sponsored expeditions to Mt Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp and the Great Wall of China. All fundraising is conducted by hundreds of student volunteers, and the organisation of RAG is run primarily by a committee of students who volunteer their time in addition to their studies.\n\nFuse FM is University of Manchester Students' Union radio station. The Student Union Executive accepted the a proposal to create the station in July 2000 and work began on creating a base for the station, which was originally called MintFM. Space in the Union basement was originally converted into a fully functioning broadcast studio and production suite. Fuse FM went on air for the first time on 15 February 2001 at 06:00, broadcasting on 106.2 FM as well as via internet streaming. Since 2003, Fuse FM has broadcast for four weeks in each academic semester. Fuse Fm was briefly denied its Spring 2008 licence to broadcast, due to the startup of community radio station RockTalk. However RockTalk collapsed in late 2007 and Ofcom granted a licence for FuseFM's 16th Broadcast.\n\nIn September 2011, Fuse FM went online only broadcasting throughout the university term time. And on 29 April 2012 began broadcasting from new state of the art studios on the first floor of the Steve Biko building after generous funding from the Manchester Learning Enrichment Fund and donation of equipment from the BBC.\n\nFuse has a history of high quality student broadcasting and its DJs have won awards in the past three National Student Radio Awards. In 2007 Becca Day-Preston won the Bronze Prize for Female Presenter of the Year, Andrew Jackson won Male Presenter of the Year in 2006, while Minnie Stephenson claimed the Female Presenter of the Year award in 2005.\n\nThere are many clubs and societies operating within the Union and the University. Common areas include sports, hobbies, politics and religion. Sports societies are not operated by the Union but rather by the University itself through the Athletics Union. There are several fairs during the freshers period in which various clubs and societies promote themselves.\n\nThere are a wide range of religious societies and places of worship within the University. A religions fair is held too, where information is distributed about the different societies. There are large Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist and Bahá'í societies which hold regular events and meetings.\n\nMost of the large subjects have their own society, which generally represents the interests of students in that subject as well as offering advice and support to students and arranging socials. Examples include the BA Econ Society, the History Society and Faculty of Life Sciences Society.\n\nThe University also has a strong Drama tradition and former students include Meera Syal, Adrian Edmondson, Rik Mayall and Ben Elton. The Drama Society holds a yearly drama festival, involving 13 plays in five theatres and over 120 students, as well as coordinating several independent student-run productions. The Fringe Society in 2006 took twelve plays and over 70 students to the Edinburgh Fringe festival under the company name \"Johnny Miller Presents\". The company was awarded a ThreeWeeks Editors' Award, which honours the most talked about and exciting people and companies at the festival.\n\nThe Manchester Debating Union (MDU) is a debating society;, membership of which is also open to people from other higher education institutions in Manchester, including Manchester Metropolitan University. The MDU was founded in 1996 and is modelled on other similar university debating societies in the UK. The Union organises the participation of Manchester students in intervarsity debating competitions, as well as arranging public debates and hosting its own competitions at both university and school levels.\n\nThe MDU was placed 5th in britishdebate.com's 2008/2009 European university debate rankings.\n\nThe MDU holds regular public debates on Thursdays during University semesters. In the past these have included politicians such as Robert Griffiths George Galloway MP, Lembit Opik MP, Tony Lloyd MP and Sir Richard Leese, as well as various notable experts, academics and campaigners. The MDU also trains its members for participation in competitive debating. Regular practice debates are held on Tuesdays and occasional master classes in issues such as international politics and specific aspects of debating are also held.\n\nAs well as the regular public debates, MDU holds 3 competitions throughout the year: one intervarsity, one national schools competition, and one local schools competition. As part of their local schools competition MDU members provide debating training to comprehensive schools within the Greater Manchester Area.\n\nIn the summer of 2013 the Manchester Debating Union hosted the European Universities Debating Championships, the largest student conference in Europe and second largest debating competition in the world.\n\nUniversity of Manchester Students' Union is twinned with An Najah University, Nablus, Palestine. A motion to enact the twinning was passed in a General Meeting in March 2007. The meeting was attended by over 600 students and the motion was passed by a majority of over 50 votes\n\nIn November 2007 a motion was proposed in the general meeting. It resolved to freeze the University of Manchester students' Union's association with Al Najah University whilst awaiting a statement \"denouncing terror and disassociating it from all terrorist organisations\".\n\nAn-Najah responded to the motion with a full statement written by the Right to Education campaign. An-Najah rejected the motion and all the accusations: \"Neither the University nor its Student Council is a terrorist organisation, and the implication that they are is insulting.\" They added that the motion is: \"defamatory because it repeatedly implies that ANU and its Student Council promotes, facilitates or has links with terrorism.\"\n\nAn amendment was put forward by the \"protect our twinning campaign\". The amendment resolved to accept the invitation made by An-Najah University for an olive tree from the university to be planted on campus at Manchester as a gesture of peace and as a symbol of life, rather than requiring An Najah to accept the statement denouncing terrorism.\n\nThis amendment passed with almost a two-thirds majority of the attendance of over 1100 students.\n\nThe twinning would have ended in March 2010, in accordance with University of Manchester Students’ Union Bye-Laws; however the sign was renewed by a decision of the executive team and remained. In October 2014, a motion was brought to the Students' Union to renew the sign and the twinning motion for an additional 3 years, and the idea went to referendum. Votes were 693 in favor and 204 against. However, a legal challenge was brought to the Students' Union about the nature of the twinning motion and the sign itself, and the Students' Union responded by removing the large sign in March 2015.\n\nA students' union and refectory building existed at Owens College on the site afterwards used for the Christie Library (1898). A larger union and refectory building was built in 1909 on Burlington Street. Both these buildings were adjoined by a gymnasium. The union and refectory building was enlarged in 1936 but the union moved to the new union building built at 242-256 Oxford Road by J. S. Beaumont in 1953-56. In 1960-65 the same architect was responsible for a new refectory and staff house on the Burlington Street site (a building which included the Moberly Tower hall of residence).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2112491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112491", "title": "Duplex (telecommunications)", "text": "Duplex (telecommunications)\n\nA duplex communication system is a point-to-point system composed of two or more connected parties or devices that can communicate with one another in both directions. Duplex systems are employed in many communications networks, either to allow for simultaneous communication in both directions between two connected parties or to provide a reverse path for the monitoring and remote adjustment of equipment in the field. There are two types of duplex communication systems: full-duplex (FDX) and half-duplex (HDX).\n\nIn a full-duplex system, both parties can communicate with each other simultaneously. An example of a full-duplex device is a telephone; the parties at both ends of a call can speak and be heard by the other party simultaneously. The earphone reproduces the speech of the remote party as the microphone transmits the speech of the local party because there is a two-way communication channel between them, or more strictly speaking because there are two communication channels between them.\n\nIn a half-duplex system, both parties can communicate with each other, but not simultaneously; the communication is one direction at a time. An example of a half-duplex device is a walkie-talkie two-way radio that has a \"push-to-talk\" button; when the local user wants to speak to the remote person they push this button, which turns on the transmitter but turns off the receiver, so they cannot hear the remote person. To listen to the other person they release the button, which turns on the receiver but turns off the transmitter.\n\nSystems that do not need the duplex capability may instead use simplex communication, in which one device transmits and the others can only \"listen\". Examples are broadcast radio and television, garage door openers, baby monitors, wireless microphones, and surveillance cameras. In these devices, the communication is only in one direction.\n\nA \"half-duplex\" (HDX) system provides communication in both directions, but only one direction at a time (not simultaneously). Typically, once a party begins receiving a signal, it must wait for the transmitter to stop transmitting, before replying.\n\nAn example of a half-duplex system is a two-party system such as a walkie-talkie, wherein one must use \"over\" or another previously designated keyword to indicate the end of transmission and ensure that only one party transmits at a time, because both parties transmit and receive on the same frequency. A good analogy for a half-duplex system would be a one-lane road with traffic controllers at each end, such as a two-lane bridge under re-construction. Traffic can flow in both directions, but only one direction at a time, regulated by the traffic controllers.\n\nHalf-duplex systems are usually used to conserve bandwidth since only a single communication channel is needed, which is shared alternately between the two directions. For example, a walkie-talkie requires only a single frequency for bidirectional communication, while a cell phone, which is a full-duplex device, requires two frequencies to carry the two simultaneous voice channels, one in each direction.\n\nIn automatically run communications systems, such as two-way data-links, the time allocations for communications in a half-duplex system can be firmly controlled by the hardware. Thus, there is no waste of the channel for switching. For example, station A on one end of the data link could be allowed to transmit for exactly one second, then station B on the other end could be allowed to transmit for exactly one second, and then the cycle repeats.\n\nIn half-duplex systems, if more than one party transmits at the same time, a collision occurs, resulting in lost messages.\n\nA \"full-duplex\" (FDX) system, or sometimes called \"double-duplex\", allows communication in both directions, and, unlike half-duplex, allows this to happen simultaneously. Land-line telephone networks are full-duplex since they allow both callers to speak and be heard at the same time, with the transition from four to two wires being achieved by a hybrid coil in a telephone hybrid. Modern cell phones are also full-duplex.\n\nA good analogy for a full-duplex system is a two-lane road with one lane for each direction. Moreover, in most full-duplex mode systems carrying computer data, transmitted data does not appear to be sent until it has been received and an acknowledgment is sent back by the other party. In this way, such systems implement reliable transmission methods.\n\nTwo-way radios can be designed as full-duplex systems, transmitting on one frequency and receiving on another; this is also called frequency-division duplex. Frequency-division duplex systems can extend their range by using sets of simple repeater stations because the communications transmitted on any single frequency always travel in the same direction.\n\nFull-duplex Ethernet connections work by making simultaneous use of two physical twisted pairs inside the same jacket, which are directly connected to each networked device: one pair is for receiving packets, while the other pair is for sending packets. This effectively makes the cable itself a collision-free environment and doubles the maximum total transmission capacity supported by each Ethernet connection.\n\nFull-duplex has also several benefits over the use of half-duplex. First, there are no collisions so time is not wasted by having to retransmit frames. Second, full transmission capacity is available in both directions because the send and receive functions are separate. Third, since there is only one transmitter on each twisted pair, stations (nodes) do not need to wait for others to complete their transmissions.\n\nSome computer-based systems of the 1960s and 1970s required full-duplex facilities, even for half-duplex operation, since their poll-and-response schemes could not tolerate the slight delays in reversing the direction of transmission in a half-duplex line.\n\nWhere channel access methods are used in point-to-multipoint networks (such as cellular networks) for dividing forward and reverse communication channels on the same physical communications medium, they are known as duplexing methods.\n\n\"Time-division duplexing\" (TDD) is the application of time-division multiplexing to separate outward and return signals. It emulates full duplex communication over a half duplex communication link.\n\nTime-division duplexing is flexible in the case where there is asymmetry of the uplink and downlink data rates. As the amount of uplink data increases, more communication capacity can be dynamically allocated, and as the traffic load becomes lighter, capacity can be taken away. The same applies in the downlink direction. The \"transmit/receive transition gap\" (TTG) is the gap (time) between a downlink burst and the subsequent uplink burst. Similarly, the \"receive/transmit transition gap\" (RTG) is the gap between an uplink burst and the subsequent downlink burst.\n\nFor stationary radio systems, the uplink and downlink radio paths are likely to be very similar. This means that techniques such as beamforming work well with TDD systems.\n\nExamples of time-division duplexing systems include:\n\n\"Frequency-division duplexing\" (FDD) means that the transmitter and receiver operate using different carrier frequencies. The method is frequently used in ham radio operation, where an operator is attempting to use a repeater station. The repeater station must be able to send and receive a transmission at the same time and does so by slightly altering the frequency at which it sends and receives. This mode of operation is referred to as \"duplex mode\" or \"offset mode\".\n\nUplink and downlink sub-bands are said to be separated by the \"frequency offset\". Frequency-division duplexing can be efficient in the case of symmetric traffic. In this case, time-division duplexing tends to waste bandwidth during the switch-over from transmitting to receiving, has greater inherent latency, and may require more complex circuitry.\n\nAnother advantage of frequency-division duplexing is that it makes radio planning easier and more efficient since base stations do not \"hear\" each other (as they transmit and receive in different sub-bands) and therefore will normally not interfere with each other. Conversely, with time-division duplexing systems, care must be taken to keep guard times between neighboring base stations (which decreases spectral efficiency) or to synchronize base stations, so that they will transmit and receive at the same time (which increases network complexity and therefore cost, and reduces bandwidth allocation flexibility as all base stations and sectors will be forced to use the same uplink/downlink ratio)\n\nExamples of frequency-division duplexing systems are:\n\nFull-duplex audio systems like telephones can create echo, which needs to be removed. Echo occurs when the sound coming out of the speaker, originating from the far end, re-enters the microphone and is sent back to the far end. The sound then reappears at the original source end but delayed. This feedback path may be acoustic, through the air, or it may be mechanically coupled, for example in a telephone handset. Echo cancellation is a signal-processing operation that subtracts the far-end signal from the microphone signal before it is sent back over the network.\n\nEcho cancellation is important technology allowing modems to achieve good full-duplex performance. The V.32, V.34, V.56, and V.90 modem standards require echo cancellation.\n\nEcho cancelers are available as both software and hardware implementations. They can be independent components in a communications system or integrated into the communication system's central processing unit. Devices that do not eliminate echo sometimes will not produce good full-duplex performance.\n"}

There is controversy about the causes of these similarities. They are usually considered to be innovations, likely to have developed after the breakup of the Proto-Indo-European language. It is also possible that some of these are not innovations, but shared conservative features, i.e. original Indo-European language features which have disappeared in all other language groups. What is commonly accepted is that the shared features may usefully be thought of as Italo-Celtic forms, as they are certainly shared by the two families and are almost certainly not coincidental.\n\nThe traditional interpretation of the data is that these two subgroups of the Indo-European language family are generally more closely related to each other than to the other Indo-European languages. This could imply that they are descended from a common ancestor, a Proto-Italo-Celtic which can be partly reconstructed by the comparative method. Those scholars who believe Proto-Italo-Celtic was an identifiable historical language estimate that it was spoken in the third or second millennium BC somewhere in south-central Europe, or even that the Italic peoples were simply a branch of the Celts who settled the Italian peninsula early but diverged due to being cut off from other Celts by the Etruscans. This hypothesis fell out of favour after being reexamined by Calvert Watkins in 1966. Nevertheless, some scholars, such as Frederik Kortlandt, continued to be interested in the theory. It is also emphatically supported by Celtologist Peter Schrijver, who adduced detailed arguments in his doctoral dissertation, published as his first book in 1991. In 2002 a paper by Ringe, Warnow, and Taylor, employing computational methods as a supplement to the traditional linguistic subgrouping methodology, argued in favour of an Italo-Celtic subgroup, and in 2007 Kortlandt attempted a reconstruction of a Proto-Italo-Celtic.\n\nThe most common alternative interpretation is that the close proximity of Proto-Celtic and Proto-Italic over a long period could have encouraged the parallel development of what were already quite separate languages; areal features within a Sprachbund. As Watkins (1966) puts it, \"the community of \"-ī\" in Italic and Celtic is attributable to early contact, rather than to an original unity\". The assumed period of language contact could then be later, perhaps continuing well into the first millennium BC.\n\nHowever, if some of the forms are archaic elements of Proto-Indo-European that were lost in other branches, neither model of post-PIE relationship need be postulated. Italic and especially Celtic also share some distinctive features with the Hittite language (an Anatolian language) and the Tocharian languages, and these features are certainly archaisms.\n\nMore recently, however, Peter Schrijver (2016) has argued a radical new interpretation, based on arguments from historical phonology, namely that Celtic arose in the Italian Peninsula as simply yet another branch of Italic, with the closest affinities to Venetic and Sabellian, and identified Proto-Celtic archaeologically with the Canegrate culture of the Late Bronze Age of Italy (c. 1300–1100 BC).\n\nThe principal Italo-Celtic forms are:\n\nA number of other similarities continue to be pointed out and debated.\n\nThe \"r\"-passive (mediopassive voice) was initially thought to be an innovation restricted to Italo-Celtic until it was found to be a retained archaism shared with Hittite, Tocharian, and possibly the Phrygian language.\n\n"}

He was the first to classify Tertiary formations and was responsible for determining geology studies as a subject of science by collecting evidence and informations in the 19th century.\n\nBrongniart was also the founder of the Musée national de Céramique-Sèvres (National Museum of Ceramics), having been director of the Sèvres Porcelain Factory from 1800 to 1847.\n\nHe was born in Paris, the son of the architect Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart and father of the botanist Adolphe-Théodore Brongniart.\n\nIn 1797, he became an instructor of natural history at the Central School of the Four Nations, and became the professor of minerology in 1822 at the Museum of Natural History in Paris. He was appointed in 1800 by Napoleon's minister of the interior Lucien Bonaparte director of the revitalized porcelain manufactory at Sèvres, holding this role until death. The young man took to the position a combination of his training as a scientist— especially as a mining engineer relevant to the chemistry of ceramics— his managerial talents and financial acumen and his cultivated understanding of neoclassical esthetic. He remained in charge of Sèvres, through regime changes, for 47 years.\n\nBrongniart introduced a new classification of reptiles and wrote several treatises on mineralogy and the ceramic arts. He also made an extensive study of trilobites and made pioneering contributions to stratigraphy by developing fossil markers for dating strata.\n\nIn 1823, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn his early ages, Brongniart focused on the studies of reptiles and published \"Essai dune classification naturally des reptiles\" in 1800, which he compared the anatomy of reptiles in order to classify them into different groups. The four classifications were Chelonia, Sauria, Ophidia and Batrachia. However, even-though he classified Batrachia as a sub-class of Reptilia, Brongniart noticed a huge difference in the anatomy of Batrachia compared to the rest of the class. This problem was resolved in 1804 by Pierre Latreille by replacing Batrachia into a class called Amphibians, and the rest of the Reptilia grouping was retained. Therefore, Batrachians is the only group that is no longer recognized as reptiles as they are amphibians.\n\nThe most significant work for Brongniart was \"Essai sur la géographie minéralogique des environs de Paris\" in collaboration with Georges Cuvier on studies of geology around Paris in 1811. At the time, Cuvier was trying figure out the periods the fossils are from and to reconstruct the extinct mammals based on the periods they are from. Their paper \"\"Essai sur la géographie minéralogique des environs de Paris\"\" identified nine formations that had been formed over a very long period of time. The formations, starting with the oldest, were called the Chalk, Argile Plastique, Calcaire grossier, Calcaire silicieux, Formation gypseuse, Sabels et Gres marins, Gres sans coquilliers, Terrain d’eau douce, and Limon d’aterrissement. Brongniart found that some of the strata had marine mollusk fossils, and some had fresh water mollusk fossils. He used the alternation of these marine and fresh water layers to disproved the theory that strata was deposited by a shrinking ocean. The paper was first read to the public on April, 1808 but was extended in June, 1808 and later on 1811. They were the among the first people to study the earth by its fossil content instead of relying on the characteristics of rocks. During the collaboration, they also found evidences against Abraham Werner's Neptunism. The results triggered Cuvier into creating catastrophism. \n\nAnother significant contribution in stratigraphy was using the fossil content in the strata he examined in Paris to identify strata in other locations instead of depth or lithology, as rocks can’t be expected to have the exact same characteristics or depth if deposited under different conditions. \n\nIn 1822, Brongniart published the first full length study of trilobites in which he classified a variety from Europe and North America and tried to group them based on age. This work contributed to later work on Paleozoic stratigraphy.\n\n\nHis wife was Cecile Coquebert de Montbret (1782–1862), the daughter of the French consul to England, Charles-Etienne Coquebert de Montbret. They had three children together. Their son, Adolphe-Théodore Brongniart, became a major figure in the study of paleobotany. Their daughter Hermine (1803–1890) married Jean Baptiste Dumas, and their other daughter Mathilde (1808–1882) married Jean Victoir Audouin.\n\n|date=August 2018}}\n\n"}

He toured a vast portion of the world, having performed in concerts in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. He was the uncle of the record producer Humberto Gatica.\n\nLucho Gatica was born in Rancagua. He attended school at Instituto O'Higgins. He and his brother Arturo were struggling singers before they released their first album, in 1949, when Gatica was 21 years old.\n\nChileans generally experienced a change in their taste in music during the 1950s, when bolero music overtook tango as Chileans' preferred music genre for some time. Singers like Cuba's Olga Guillot, and Argentinian Leo Marini and Mexican Elvira Ríos, among others, were very popular during that time. So were Xavier Cugat and his orchestra, which included Puerto Rican Bobby Capó. These singers would influence Gatica.\n\nGatica's first record, 1951's \"Me Importas Tú\" (\"You Matter to Me\") became a mega hit across Latin America, opening many doors for Gatica. He followed that with 1952's \"Contigo en la Distancia\" (\"With You in the Distance\"). Gatica recorded his version of Consuelo Velázquez's \"Bésame Mucho\" (\"Kiss Me a Lot\") in 1953, a year in which he produced two more albums, \"Las Muchachas de la Plaza España\" (\"The Girls from Spain Square\") and \"Sinceridad\" (\"Sincerity\"). The following year his hit \"Sinceridad\" was released.\n\nBy 1957, Gatica moved to Mexico, a country that would be of great importance in his life. In Mexico, he released \"No me Platiques Más\" (\"Don't Talk to me Anymore\"), \"Tú me Acostumbraste\" (\"You Accustomed Me\") and \"Voy a Apagar la Luz\" (\"I'm Turning the Lights Off\"), which was released in 1959.\n\nIn 1956, Gatica's songs were recorded in North America on LP albums for the first time by Capitol Records ('Capitol of the World' series). Three albums were released within 14 months by Capitol. The third one in that group with Capitol was \"El Gran Gatica\", which featured such songs as \"Somos\" (\"We Are\"), \"Sabrá Dios\" (\"God Will Know\"), and \"Si me Comprendieras\" (\"If You Understood Me\"). One of the three Lucho Gatica albums released in 1958 was a greatest hits compilation; the third was named \"Envenenados\" (\"Poisoned\"). He also recorded a song entitled \"Encadenados\" (\"Chained [We Are]\").\n\nGatica had important changes in his personal life after arriving in Mexico for the first time. He decided to become a permanent resident of that North American country, and married Puerto Rican actress Mapita Cortés, who had been a celebrity in Mexico (and Puerto Rico) for some years, and who also resided in Mexico. The couple had two sons named Luis and Alfredo. Luis went on to become a telenovela and rock star during the 1980s and Alfredo (Alfie) became a music entrepreneur. Gatica remarried an American woman and had one daughter named Lily, as well. One of Gatica's last known releases was 1963's \"Recuerdos de Amor\" (\"Memories of Love\"). He had seven children.\n\nIn 2001, Gatica was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame. In the same year, his renditions of \"La Barca\" and \"El Reloj\" were inducted into the Latin Grammy Hall of Fame. Gatica himself was one of the recipients of the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007. He also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Recording in 2008.\n\nGatica died in Mexico on 13 November 2018 from pneumonia.\n\n"}

Leaderless resistance can encompass anything from non-violent protest and civil disobedience to vandalism, terrorism, and other violent activity.\n\nLeaderless cells lack vertical command links and so operate without hierarchical command, but they have a common goal that links them to the social movement from which their ideology was learned.\n\nLeaderless resistance has been employed by a wide range of movements, including animal-liberation, radical environmentalist, anti-abortion, military invasion resistance, colonialism resistance, terrorist, and hate groups.\n\nThe non-hierarchical, decentralized organization is simple and difficult to stamp out. However, with the absence of a formal hierarchy and formal criteria for membership and affiliation, they are vulnerable to appropriation, false flagging or hostile takeover from the outside, since anyone can declare oneself a member of and affiliate with the group.\n\nA covert cell may be a lone individual or a small group. The basic characteristic of the structure is that there is no explicit communication between cells that are acting toward shared goals. Members of one cell usually have little or no information about who else is agitating on behalf of their cause.\n\nLeaderless movements may have a symbolic figurehead. This can be a public figure, a multiple-use name, or an inspirational author, who picks generic targets and objectives, but does not actually manage or execute plans. Media, in this case, often create a positive feedback loop: by publishing declarations of a movement’s role model, this instills motivation, ideas, and assumed sympathy in the minds of potential agitators who in turn lend further authority to the figurehead. While this may loosely resemble a vertical command structure, it is notably unidirectional: a titular leader makes pronouncements, and activists may respond, but there is no formal contact between the two levels of organization.\n\nAs a result, leaderless resistance cells are resistant to informants and traitors. As there is neither a center that may be destroyed, nor links between the cells that may be infiltrated, it is more difficult for established authorities to arrest the development of a leaderless resistance movement than it is with movements that adopt more conventional hierarchies.\n\nGiven of leaderless resistance, and the fact that it is often strategically adopted in the face of a power imbalance, it has much in common with guerrilla warfare. The latter strategy, however, usually retains some form of organized, bidirectional leadership and is often more than the individualized actions of leaderless cells. In some cases, a largely leaderless movement may evolve into a coherent insurgency or guerrilla movement, as with the Yugoslav partisans of World War II.\n\nLeaderless resistance often involves resistance by violent means, but it is not limited to them. Non-violent groups can use the same structure to author, print, and distribute samizdat literature, to create self-propagating boycotts against political opponents via the internet, to maintain an alternative electronic currency outside of the reach of taxing governments and transaction-logging banks, and so forth.\n\nThe concept of leaderless resistance was developed by Col. Ulius Louis Amoss, a former U.S. intelligence officer, in the early 1960s. An anti-communist, Amoss saw leaderless resistance as a way to prevent the penetration and destruction of CIA-supported resistance cells in Eastern European countries under Soviet control.\n\nThe concept was revived and popularized in an essay published by the anti-government Ku Klux Klan member Louis Beam in 1983 and again in 1992. Beam advocated leaderless resistance as a technique for white nationalists to continue the struggle against the U.S. government, despite an overwhelming imbalance in power and resources.\n\nBeam argued that conventional hierarchical pyramidal organizations are extremely dangerous for their participants, when employed in a resistance movement against government, because of the ease of disclosing the chain of command. A less dangerous approach would be to convince like-minded individuals to form independent cells without close communication between each other but generally operating in the same direction.\n\nThe first recorded direct action for animal liberation which progressed (after a considerable delay) into a movement of leaderless resistance was by the original \"Band of Mercy\" in 1824 whose goal was to thwart fox hunters. Inspired by this group and after seeing a pregnant deer driven into the village by fox hunters to be killed, John Prestige decided to actively oppose this sport and formed the Hunt Saboteurs Association (HSA) in 1964. Within a year, a leaderless model of hunt-sabotage groups was formed across the country.\n\nA new Band of Mercy was then formed in 1972. It used direct action to liberate animals and cause economic sabotage against those thought to be abusing animals. Ronnie Lee and others changed the name of the movement to the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) in 1976 and adopted a leaderless resistance model focusing broadly on animal liberation.\n\nEarth First! and the environmental movement in the 1980s also adopted the leaderless resistance model. An animal liberation movement advocating violence emerged with the name Animal Rights Militia (ARM) in 1982. Letter bombs were sent to the then British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. Two years later the name Hunt Retribution Squad (HRS) was also used.\n\nThe Earth Liberation Front (ELF) formed in 1992, breaking from Earth First! when that organization decided to focus on public direct action, instead of the ecotage that the ELF participated in. A violent group called the Justice Department was established in 1993, and in 1994 to hunters such as Prince Charles and to animal researchers.\n\nIn 1999 the leaderless resistance strategy was employed by animal liberation organisations like Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC), which was formed from the Consort beagles campaign and Save the Hill Grove Cats to close down Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS). Despite claiming successes leaderless animal liberation and environmental movements generally lack the broad popular support that often occurs in strictly political or military conflicts. The Revolutionary Cells--Animal Liberation Brigade (RCALB) appeared in 2003 and sent pipe bombs to Chiron Corporation and used incendiary devices against other targets.\n\nWithin a few years of the victories claimed by the SHAC, other campaigns against animal testing laboratories emerged. At the same time, SPEAK Campaigns and the more radical ALF militants, Oxford Arson Squad began their campaigns towards the same goal: to end Oxford University's animal research.\n\nIn April 2009, the Militant Forces Against Huntingdon Life Sciences (MFAH) became active. With the ALF, they began targeting HLS customer and financial Directors, as well as company property. Since then, groups have reported over a dozen actions in Europe, including painting homes, burning cars, and grave desecration. Militants, however, oppose , instead believing in any necessary action to prevent suffering at HLS's laboratories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaderless resistance is also often well-suited to terrorist objectives. The Islamist organization Al-Qaeda uses a typical figurehead/leaderless cell structure. The organization itself may be pyramidal, but sympathizers who act on its pronouncements often do so spontaneously and independently.\n\nGiven the small, clandestine character of terrorist cells, it is easy to assume they necessarily constitute leaderless resistance models. When there is bidirectional communication with external leadership, however, the label is inappropriate. The men who executed the bombings of the London Underground on July 7, 2005 constituted a leaderless resistance cell in that they purportedly acted out of sympathy for Islamic fundamentalism but under their own auspices. The hijackers involved in the September 11 attacks, by contrast, allegedly received training, direction, and funding from Al-Qaeda, and are not properly designated a leaderless cell.\n\nThe concept of leaderless resistance remains important to much far right thinking in the United States, as a proposed response to perceived federal government over-reach at the expense of individual rights. Simson Garfinkel, however, found in his research that for the most part the far right seldom used this tactic. Timothy McVeigh is one example in the United States. McVeigh worked in a small cell which based its attack on motivations widespread among far-right anti-government groups and the militia movement.\n\nLeaderless resistance has been advocated by white supremacist groups such as White Aryan Resistance (WAR) and the British neo-Nazi Combat 18 (C18). The modern Ku Klux Klan is also credited with having developed a leaderless resistance model. Troy Southgate also advocated forms of leaderless resistance during his time as a leading activist in the National Revolutionary Faction and a pioneer of National-Anarchism. James Mason a former American Nazi Party member and neo-Nazi was a proponent of the idea of \"leaderless resistance\" as detailed in \"SIEGE\" a collection of writings from the defunct National Socialist Liberation Front (NSLF) which advocated violence against political opponents, Jews and non-whites of which he deemed to be the supposedly Jewish controlled entity he referred to as \"The System\" which has since been embraced by the terrorist group Atomwaffen Division (AWD) in the modern day.\n\nStormfront, Aryan Nations, and Hammerskin Nation (HSN) link to Beam's \"Leaderless Resistance\". These groups promote lone wolf actions. Stormfront, while regretting the loss of life, explains how Benjamin Nathaniel Smith's 1998 killing spree was compelled by circumstances. The World Church of the Creator (WCOTC) gave a mixed message, calling Smith \"a selfless man who gave his life in the resistance to Jewish/mud tyranny,\" but noting \"the Church does not condone his acts.\"\n\nModern-day leaderless resistance/lone-wolf terrorism has manifested itself in numerous violent mass shootings/terrorist attacks committed by the far-right. These include:\n\n1999 Los Angeles Jewish Community Center shooting at North Valley Jewish Community Center and Chatsworth in Los Angeles, California by Aryan Nations member Buford O. Furrow. \n\nThe 1999 murders of gay couple Gary Matson and Winfield Mowder and the burnings of three synagogues and the Country Club Medical Center in Sacramento, California by brothers Benjamin Matthew Williams and James Tyler Williams.\n\nThe 2008 Knoxville Unitarian Universalist church shooting at Tennessee Valley Universalist Unitarian Church in Knoxville, Tennessee by Jim David Adkisson.\n\nThe 2009 United States Holocaust Memorial Museum shooting at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C. by Holocaust denier James Von Brunn.\n\nThe 2011 Norway attacks at Regjeringskvartalet (Government Quarter) and Utoya Island in Oslo/Utoya, Norway by Knights Templar' member Anders Behring Breivik.\n\nThe 2012 Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek, Wisconsin by Hammerskin Nation member Wade Michael Page.\n\nThe 2014 Overland Park Jewish Community Center shooting at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City and Village Shalom in Overland Park, Kansas by former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard/White Patriot Party leader Frazier Glenn Miller.\n\nThe 2015 Charleston church shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina by Dylann Roof.\n\nThe 2015 Lafayette theatre shooting at Grand 16 movie theatre in Lafayette, Louisiana by John Russell Houser.\n\nThe 2016 murder of Labour MP Jo Cox at Market Street in Birstall, West Yorkshire, United Kingdom by neo-Nazi apartheid supporter Thomas Mair.\n\nThe 2017 Quebec City mosque shooting at the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec City in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada by Marine Le Pen/Donald Trump supporter Alexandre Bissonnette.\n\nThe 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting at Tree of Life - Or L'Simcha Congregation by Gab user Robert Bowers.\n\nThe 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand by Australia-born Brenton Harrison Tarrant.\n\nThe Escondido mosque fire and Poway synagogue shooting by Brenton Harrsion Tarrant/Robert Bowers copycat John T. Earnest in 2019. \n\nThe 2019 El Paso Walmart shooting at Walmart in El Paso, Texas by Patrick Crusius.\n\nLeaderless resistance emerged in the environmental movement in 1976 when John Hanna and others as the Environmental Life Force (ELF) (also known now as the \"original ELF\") used explosive and incendiary devices. The group conducted armed actions in northern California and Oregon, later disbanding in 1978 following Hanna's arrest for placing incendiary devices on seven crop-dusters at the Salinas, California airport on May Day, 1977. A decade and a half later this form of guerrilla warfare resurfaced using the same acronym.\nIn 1980 Earth First! was founded by Dave Foreman and others to confront environmental destruction, primarily of the American West. Inspired by the Edward Abbey novel \"The Monkey Wrench Gang\", Earth First! made use of such techniques as treesitting and treespiking to stop logging companies, as well as other activities targeted towards mining, road construction, suburban development, and energy companies.\n\nThe organization was committed to nonviolent ecotage techniques from the group's inception. Others split from the movement in the 1990s, including the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) in 1992, which named itself after the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) which had formed in the 1970s. Three years later in Canada, inspired by the ELF in Europe, the first \"Earth Liberation\" direct action occurred, but this time as the Earth Liberation Army (ELA), a similar movement who use ecotage and monkeywrenching as a tool.\n\nA series of actions earned ELF the label of eco-terrorists, including the burning of a ski resort in Vail, Colorado in 1998, and the burning of an SUV dealership in Oregon in 1999. In the same year the ELA made headlines by setting fire to the Vail Resorts in Washington, D.C., causing $12 million in damages. The defendants in that case were later charged in the FBI's \"Operation Backfire\" with other crimes; this was later named by environmentalists as the Green Scare, alluding to the Red Scare periods of fear over communist infiltration of U.S.\n\nFollowing the September 11, 2001 attacks several laws were passed increasing the penalty for ecoterrorism, and the U.S. Congress held hearings on the activity of groups such as the ELF. To date no one has been killed as a result of an ELF or ALF action, and both groups forbid harming human or non-human life. It was announced in 2003 that \"\"eco-terrorist\"\" attacks, known as \"\"ecotage\"\", had increased from the ELF, ELA, and the \"\"Environmental Rangers\"\", another name used by activists when engaging in similar activity.\n\nIn 2005 the FBI announced that the ELF was America's greatest domestic terrorist threat, responsible for over 1,200 \"criminal incidents\" amounting to tens of millions of dollars in damage to property. The United States Department of Homeland Security confirmed this with regards to both the ALF and ELF.\n\n\nAnti-abortion militants The Army of God use leaderless resistance as their organizing principle. As of 2009, The Army of God's webpage hosts a reprint of an article entitled \"Leaderless Resistance\" from a publication called \"The Seditionist.\"\n\nLeaderless resistance social networks are potentially vulnerable to social network analysis and its derivative, link analysis. Link analysis of social networks is the fundamental reason for the ongoing legislative push in the U.S. and the European Union for mandatory retention of telecommunication traffic data and for limiting access to anonymous prepaid cellphones, as the stored data contain important network analysis clues.\nNetwork analysis was successfully used by French Colonel Yves Godard to break the Algerian resistance between 1955 and 1957 and force them to cease their bombing campaigns. The Algerian conflict may be better described as guerrilla in nature rather than leaderless resistance (see \"Modern Warfare\" by Col. Roger Trinquier), and this illustrates the weakness of cell-structured insurgents when compared to leaderless ones. were obtained by the use of informants and torture and were used to obtain the identities of important individuals in the resistance; these individuals were then assassinated, which disrupted the Algerian resistance networks. The more irreplaceable the individual is in the adversary's network, the greater the damage is done to the network by removing them.\n\nTraditional organizations leave behind much evidence of their activities, such as money trails, and training and recruitment material. Leaderless resistances, supported more by ideologies than organizations, generally lack such traces. The effects of their operations, as reported by the mass media, act as a sort of messaging and recruitment advertising.\n\nThe internet provides counterinsurgents with further challenges. Individual cells (and even a single person can be a cell) can communicate over the internet, anonymously or semi-anonymously sharing information online, to be found by others through well-known websites. Even when it is legally and technically possible to ascertain who accessed what, it is often practically impossible to discern in a reasonable timeframe who is a real threat and who is just curious, a journalist, or a web crawler.\n\nDespite these advantages, leaderless resistance is often unstable. If the actions are not frequent enough or not successful, the stream of publicity, which serves as the recruiting, motivation, and coordination drives for other cells, diminishes. On the other hand, if the actions are too successful, support groups and other social structures will form that are vulnerable to network analysis.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the capital city of the Nickerie district, and the terminus of the East-West Link.\n\nNieuw Nickerie lies on the mouth of the Nickerie river on the Atlantic coast, opposite the mouth of the Corantijn river (Courantyne) and the Guyanese town of Corriverton (Springlands), to which a ferry service operates. A bridge between Apoera and Orealla in Guyana is still being planned. Major Henk Fernandes Airport, also known as \"Nieuw Nickerie Airport\", is located near the city.\n\nIn 1718, Dietzel became the first known person to settle in the area. In 1797, governor Juriaan François Frederici approved the first plantation in Nickerie. A large number of Scottish and English settlers arrived in the area during the British Occupation, and primarily grew cotton and coffee. Nieuw Nickerie was built in 1879 after the former center of the district, Nieuw Rotterdam, was destroyed by floods. Nieuw Nickerie was originally planned on a polder created in 1869, but was moved further in land. In 1940s a sea dike was built to protect the area.\n\nThe name Nickerie is probably based on \"Neekeari\" which was first reported by Teenstra in 1596 for an indigenous tribe living the area. The name also appears in Robert Dudley's \"The Voyage of Robert Dudley to the West-Indies, 1594-1595\".\n\nThe main industries are bananas and rice. Nickerie is the largest rice producer of Suriname. The town contains a market and several hotels, including the Hotel Ameerali, Hotel de President, Hotel Tropical, Hotel de Vesting and Residence Inn. The first Surinamese hospital outside of Paramaribo, Mungra Medical Centre, is located on the Annastraat in Nieuw-Nickerie.\n\nNickerie has a harbour, but the entrance depth is 3.7 metres and can carter to ships up to 6,000 tonnes. The harbour has been upgraded in 2012, but will be upgraded further.\n\nNieuw Nickerie is started to develop as a tourist area. There are quite a number of hotels in the city, and the nearby Bigi Pan Nature Reserve opened opportunities for ecotourism.\n\n\n<div style=\"width:100%\">\n"}

It is made by the Pinkerton Tobacco company of Owensboro, Kentucky. In 1985, Pinkerton was acquired by a Swedish corporation, and after further corporate reshuffling, the Red Man brand now falls under the umbrella of the Swedish Match company, which in turn is owned primarily by \ninstitutional investors. The proportion owned by non-Swedish investors is approximately 80%.\n\nThe Red Man brand was introduced in 1904 by Pinkerton Tobacco (incorporated in 1901).\n\nEarly in its history, Red Man advertisements were painted on the sides of barns, featuring an endorsement from baseball player Nap Lajoie: \"Lajoie chews Red Man, ask him if he don't.\" Red Man was initially sold in a few Midwestern states; it expanded (in 1954) into the South and then (in 1963) largely nationwide. The corporation's marketing material describes Red Man's consumer base: \"A large number of consumers work outdoors and enjoy hunting, fishing and watch [sic] auto racing.\" Contemporary materials from Swedish Match also suggest that the brand name came from something of an homage to American Indians.\n\nMarketing tie-ins with rural and outdoor sports have been a hallmark of the Red Man brand. From 1952 to 1955, Red Man produced a series of baseball cards, the only tobacco company to do so after 1920. The sets are valuable due to the appearance of 25 of the top players of 1952–55, including Stan Musial, Yogi Berra and Willie Mays.\n\nIn 1982, Red Man launched its first TV advertising ever, produced by the ad agency Benton & Bowles. This decision came after Levi Garrett's aggressive entrance on the chewing tobacco market in the US.\n\nSince then, the brand has sponsored competitive events including the \"Red Man All-American Pulling Series\", a tractor pulling circuit, and the \"Red Man All-American Bass Championship\", a fishing competition. In 1991, under pressure from the Federal Trade Commission, which was enforcing a 1986 U.S. statute banning television ads for smokeless tobacco, Red Man agreed to stop displaying its \"product logo, selling message or the color or design of the tobacco product or its package\" during televised coverage of the tractor pulls. The competitive fishing circuit that culminated in the Bass Championship was sponsored by the company and called the \"Red Man Tournament Trail\" from 1983 to 2000, after which Wal-Mart took over as the name sponsor.\n\n\n\n"}

Subsequent rivalry between European colonial powers, trade opportunities and Christian missions drove further European exploration and eventual settlement. After the 17th century Dutch landings in New Zealand and Australia, but not settling these lands, the British became the dominant colonial power in the region, establishing settler colonies in what would become Australia and New Zealand, both of which now have majority European-descended populations. New Caledonia (Caldoche), Hawaii, French Polynesia, Norfolk Island and Guam also have significant European populations. Europeans remain a primary ethnic group in much of Oceania, both numerically and economically.\n\nEuropean settlement in Australia began in 1788 when the British established the Crown Colony of New South Wales with the first settlement at Port Jackson. New Zealand was part of New South Wales until 1840 when it became a separate colony and experienced a marked increase in European settlement.\n\nWhile the largest European ethnic group to originally settle in both Australia and New Zealand were the English, the settler population in Australia from early times contained a large Irish Catholic component, in contrast to New Zealand which was more Scottish in composition.\n\nFor generations, the vast majority of both colonial-era settlers and post-independence immigrants to Australia and New Zealand came almost exclusively from the British Isles. However, waves of European immigrants were later drawn from a broader range of countries. Australia, in particular, received large numbers of European immigrants from countries such as Italy, Greece, Germany, the Netherlands, and Yugoslavia following the Second World War.\n\nThe total population of people that have European ancestry in Oceania is over 23,600,000, with the inclusion of the population of Hawaii.\n\n\nThe dominant European group of Australia are referred to as Anglo-Celtic Australians (although this does not include non-British Europeans); the proper term for Australians of European ancestry is European Australian. In New Zealand, the census gathers information on ethnicity, not ancestry. It shows the majority of the New Zealand population identify as New Zealand European. The term Pākehā used in some previous Censuses has a similar meaning.\n\n"}

They feared that the large number of competing parties would ultimately lead to nationalist and anti-Communist votes being split, thus allowing the League of Communists of Croatia-Party of Democratic Changes (SKH-SDP, later to become Social Democratic Party of Croatia, SDP) to remain in power. Instead they advocated that all those parties form a broad coalition with two of them as nominal leaders. Another reason for forming the Coalition was for Croatia to have a post-Communist government of many different parties instead of one, which was supposed to help develop the nascent democracy and prevent eventual return to one-party rule.\n\nIt initially seemed that this plan by Dabčević-Kučar and Tripalo was working. Coalition was indeed joined by large number of parties - centrist Croatian Social Liberal Party, moderate right-wing Croatian Democratic Party and Croatian Christian Democratic Party, as well as the nominally left-wing Social Democrats of Croatia (later merged with SDP), and number of local, youth and environmentalist groups and individual candidates. Another boost came in the form of open letter by some 200 top Croatian artists, scientists and intellectuals expressing support for Coalition. However, it soon became apparent that Coalition would have to compete not only with the Communist government, but also with the more extremist Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). The emerging nationalism in other parts of Yugoslavia (Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia) garnered popularity for more radical parties.\n\nAnother obstacle for Coalition was runoff voting system, which favored two strongest parties or electoral blocs. In the first round of elections it became apparent that reformed-communists, now rebranded into Social Democratic Party of Croatia, had enough support to finish second in most of the constituencies. Most of the Coalition candidates finished third, although many refused to abandon the race before the second round. In the end, only a small number of Coalition candidates was elected, 21 in all three houses (chambers) of parliament (Chamber of Municipalities, Socio-Political Chamber and Chamber of Associated Labour). HDZ won majority in Croatian Parliament, while the SDP became the main opposition party.\n\nThe Coalition began to disintegrate. Dabčević-Kučar and Tripalo formed their own Croatian People's Party in Autumn 1990.\n"}

He attended St Bartholomew's Primary School in Rainhill and West Park Grammar School.\n\nHe read English at Keble College, Oxford, where he went on to earn a doctorate. He wrote criticism for the magazine \"Living Marxism\". As a result, there was supposedly always a copy of the magazine on sale in the newsagent set of long-running British soap \"Coronation Street\", while Cottrell Boyce was on the writing staff of that programme.\n\nThe then Frank Boyce met Denise Cottrell, a fellow Keble undergraduate, and they married in Keble College chapel. Together they have seven children. He is also a patron of the Insight Film Festival, a biennial, interfaith festival held in Manchester, UK, to make positive contributions to understanding, respect and community cohesion.\nHis favourite foods are fish finger sandwiches, marmite and wine gums.\n\nAfter he met Michael Winterbottom, the two collaborated on \"Forget About Me\". Winterbottom made five further films based on screenplays written by Cottrell-Boyce, \"Butterfly Kiss\", \"Welcome to Sarajevo\", \"The Claim\", \"24 Hour Party People\" and \"Code 46\". Their 2005 collaboration, \"A Cock and Bull Story\", is their last according to Cottrell-Boyce, who asked that his contribution be credited to \"Martin Hardy\", a pseudonym. He told \"Variety\", \"I just had to move on ... what better way to walk away than by giving Winterbottom a good script for free?\"\n\nOther film directors Cottrell-Boyce has worked with include Danny Boyle (\"Millions\"), Alex Cox (\"Revengers Tragedy\"), Richard Laxton (\"Grow Your Own\") and Anand Tucker (\"Hilary and Jackie\").\n\nCottrell-Boyce has been praised by Roger Ebert as one of the few truly inventive modern-day screenwriters. He has spoken against the \"three-act structure\" and the \"hero's journey\" formulas, which are often regarded as axiomatic truths in the business.\n\nIn addition to original scripts, Cottrell-Boyce has also adapted novels for the screen and written children's fiction. His first novel \"Millions\" was based on his own screenplay for the film of the same name; it was published by Macmillan in 2004. Cottrell-Boyce won the annual Carnegie Medal from the British librarians, recognising it as the year's best children's book published in the U.K. His next novel \"Framed\", he made the shortlist for both the Carnegie and the Whitbread Children's Book Award. He adapted it as a screenplay for a 2009 BBC television film. He made the Carnegie shortlist again for \"Cosmic\" (2008). In 2011, he was commissioned to write a sequel to the Ian Fleming children's book Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, which was published in October 2011 as \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Flies Again\" In addition to \"Coronation Street\", he wrote many episodes of the soap opera \"Brookside\", as well as its spin-off \"Damon and Debbie\".\n\nHe wrote and staged his first original theatre production \"Proper Clever\" at the Liverpool Playhouse during the city's European Capital of Culture Year, in 2008. On 18 September 2010, he co-presented the Papal Visit at Hyde Park with TV personality Carol Vorderman. In June 2012, he assumed the position of Professor of Reading (the first such professorship) at Liverpool Hope University.\n\nCottrell-Boyce was the writer of the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, whose storyline he based on Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\". He collaborated with director Danny Boyle and other members of the creative team, including designer Mark Tildesley, in the development of the story and themes, and wrote \"short documents that told the story of each segment\" to provide context for choreographers, builders and other participants. He also wrote the brochure, the stadium announcements and the media guide for presenter Huw Edwards.\n\nThree months later, Cottrell-Boyce won the 2012 Guardian Children's Fiction Prize for \"The Unforgotten Coat\". That story of a crosscultural friendship was inspired by a Mongolian girl he met as a writer visiting her school, whose family was subsequently deported by the British immigration office. It was commissioned by Reader Organisation of Liverpool and 50,000 copies were given away. The Guardian Prize is judged by a panel of British children's writers and recognises the year's best book by an author who has not yet won it. Interviewed by the sponsoring newspaper, Cottrell Boyce told \"The Guardian\" that \"I'm definitely a children's writer[;] that's what I want to be.

Instead of detecting network collisions, CSMA/CARP attempts to avoid collisions by using a system of transmission priorities.\n\nWhen a station wants to transmit on a CSMA/CARP network it first listens for network traffic and if the medium is clear instead of immediately transmitting as a station would in CSMA/CD it waits a predefined amount of time. This waiting period is called the interframe spacing (IFS) and it varies by the type of data being transmitted. High priority data will transmit almost immediately whereas lower priority data such as polling will have a longer IFS. This system allows CSMA/CARP to avoid many collisions that would occur if it was not used. In addition to having a different IFS per priority, a station in a CSMA/CARP network will add a \"random backoff\" to its waiting period, to reduce the collision probability between stations that have to transmit packets in the same priority.\n\n"}
{"id": "2112593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112593", "title": "English draughts", "text": "English draughts\n\nEnglish draughts (British English) or checkers (American English; see spelling differences), also called American checkers or straight checkers, is a form of the strategy board game draughts. It is played on an 8×8 chequered board with 12 pieces per side. The pieces move and capture diagonally forward, until they reach the opposite end of the board, when they are crowned and can thereafter move and capture both backward and forward.\n\nAs in all forms of draughts, English draughts is played by two opponents, alternating turns on opposite sides of the board. The pieces are traditionally black, red, or white. Enemy pieces are captured by jumping over them.\n\nThe 8×8 variant of draughts was weakly solved in 2007 by the team of Canadian computer scientist Jonathan Schaeffer. From the standard starting position, both players can guarantee a draw with perfect play.\n\nThough pieces are traditionally made of wood, now many are made of plastic, though other materials may be used. Pieces are typically flat and cylindrical. They are invariably split into one darker and one lighter colour. Traditionally and in tournaments, these colours are red and white, but black and red are common in the United States, as well as dark- and light-stained wooden pieces. The darker-coloured side is commonly referred to as \"Black\"; the lighter-coloured side, \"White\". \n\nThere are two classes of pieces: \"men\" and \"kings\". Men are single pieces. Kings consist of two men of the same colour, stacked one on top of the other. The bottom piece is referred to as \"crowned\". Some sets have pieces with a crown molded, engraved or painted on one side, allowing the player to simply turn the piece over or to place the crown-side up on the crowned man, further differentiating kings from men. Pieces are often manufactured with indentations to aid stacking.\n\nEach player starts with 12 men on the dark squares of the three rows closest to that player's side (see diagram). The row closest to each player is called the \"kings row\" or \"crownhead\". The player with the darker-coloured pieces moves first. Then alternate.\n\nThere are two different ways to move in English draughts:\n\n\"Multiple jumps\" are possible, if after one jump, another piece is immediately eligible to be jumpedeven if that jump is in a different diagonal direction. If more than one multi-jump is available, the player can choose which piece to jump with, and which sequence of jumps to make. The sequence chosen is not required to be the one that maximizes the number of jumps in the turn; however, a player must make all available jumps in the sequence chosen.\n\nIf a man moves into the kings row on the opponent's side of the board, it is crowned as a king and gains the ability to move both forward and backward. If a man moves into the kings row or if it \"jumps\" into the kings row, the current move terminates; the piece is crowned as a king but cannot jump back out as in a multi-jump, until another move.\n\nA player wins by capturing all of the opponent's pieces. The game ends in a draw if by leaving the opponent with no legal move or neither side can force a win, or by agreement (one side offering a draw, the other accepting).\n\n\nThere is a standardised notation for recording games. All 32 reachable board squares are numbered in sequence. The numbering starts in Black's double-corner. Black's squares on the first rank are numbered \"1\" to \"4\"; the next rank \"5\" to \"8\", and so on. Moves are recorded as \"from-to\", so a move from 9 to 14 would be recorded 9-14. Captures are notated with an \"x\" connecting the start and end squares. The game result is often abbreviated as BW/RW (Black/Red wins) or WW (White wins).\n\nWhite resigned after Black's 46th move.\n\nIn Unicode, the draughts are encoded in block Miscellaneous Symbols:\n\nThe men's World Championship in English draughts dates to the 1840s, predating the men's Draughts World Championship, the championship for men in International draughts, by several decades. Noted world champions include Andrew Anderson, James Wyllie, Robert Martins, Robert D. Yates, James Ferrie, Alfred Jordan, Newell W. Banks, Robert Stewart, Asa Long, Walter Hellman, Marion Tinsley, Derek Oldbury, Ron King, Michele Borghetti, Alex Moiseyev, Patricia Breen, and Amangul Durdyyeva. Championship held in GAYP (Go As You Please) and 3-Move versions. The winners in men's have been from the United Kingdom, United States, Barbados, and most recently Italy in the 3-Move division.\n\nThe woman's championship is more recent and started in 1993, the winners have been from Ireland, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine.\n\nThe European Cup has been held since 2013; the World Cup, since 2015.\n\nThe first English draughts computer program was written by Christopher Strachey, M.A. at the National Physical Laboratory, London. Strachey finished the programme, written in his spare time, in February 1951. It ran for the first time on NPL's Pilot ACE on 30 July 1951. He soon modified the programme to run on the Manchester Mark 1.\n\nThe second computer program was written in 1956 by Arthur Samuel, a researcher from IBM. Other than it being one of the most complicated game playing programs written at the time, it is also well known for being one of the first adaptive programs. It learned by playing games against modified versions of itself, with the victorious versions surviving. Samuel's program was far from mastering the game, although one win against a blind checkers master gave the general public the impression that it was very good.\n\nIn the 1990s, the strongest program was \"Chinook\", written in 1989 by a team from the University of Alberta led by Jonathan Schaeffer. Marion Tinsley, world champion from 1955–1962 and from 1975–1991, won a match against the machine in 1992. In 1994, Tinsley had to resign in the middle of an even match for health reasons; he died shortly thereafter. In 1995, Chinook defended its man-machine title against Don Lafferty in a thirty-two game match. The final score was 1–0 with 31 draws for Chinook over Don Lafferty. In 1996 Chinook won in the U.S. National Tournament by the widest margin ever, and was retired from play after that event. The man-machine title has not been contested since.\n\nIn July 2007, in an article published in \"Science Magazine\", Chinook's developers announced that the program had been improved to the point where it could not lose a game. If no mistakes were made by either player, the game would always end in a draw. After eighteen years, they have computationally proven a weak solution to the game of checkers. Using between two hundred desktop computers at the peak of the project and around fifty later on, the team made just 10 calculations to search from the initial position to a database of positions with at most ten pieces. However, the solution is only for the initial position rather than for all 156 accepted random 3 move openings of tournament play.\n\nThe number of possible positions in English draughts is 500,995,484,682,338,672,639 and it has a game-tree complexity of approximately 10. By comparison, chess is estimated to have between 10 and 10 legal positions.\n\nWhen draughts is generalized so that it can be played on an \"n\"×\"n\" board, the problem of determining if the first player has a win in a given position is EXPTIME-complete.\n\nThe July 2007 announcement by Chinook's team stating that the game had been solved must be understood in the sense that, with perfect play on both sides, the game will always finish with a draw. However, not all positions that could result from imperfect play have been analysed.\n\n\n"}

Before graduating though, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy on 11 May 1917. In the Naval Aviation Service during WWI, he became Naval Aviator No. 469 on 12 March 1918. He was then assigned to Cape May, New Jersey, where he became chief pilot. On 3 Dec. he retired from active duty, and completed his chemistry degree at Cornell on 1 Oct. 1919. After graduation he was hired by the engineering department of Crown Willamette Paper Company in Camas, Washington, but continued to fly in the Naval Reserve in San Diego. In 1921 he was made plant manager for Crown Willamette's facility in Floriston, California. After taking time off to be with his mother in Palo Alto, California, Russel moved to Portland, Oregon, and became general manager of Kern Clay Products and married Thyra Allen.\n\nOn 5 April 5 1925, Russel responded to an advertisement offering a flying boat for sale in Portland, a Curtiss Model F. This was the start of an aviation partnership based in Alaska between Russel, Roy Davis and Cyril Krugner. Departing Lake Washington on 19 May 1925, then landed at Ketchikan, Alaska, on 26 May. This was only the second nonmilitary flight up the Pacific Coast to Alaska, the first being made in 1922 by Roy F. Jones and Gerald J. Smith. Thus started the charter flights and barnstorming flying business of the Roy J. Davis Airplane Company.\n\nRussel Merrill and Roy Davis flew from Juneau to Seward over the Gulf of Alaska 1-3 Aug. 1925, the first to do so since the First aerial circumnavigation of 1924. Then, on 20 Aug. 1925, Merrill and Davis became the first to fly an airplane to Anchorage. Then, at the end of August, Merrill and Davis flew Gus Gelles to Seldovia, Alaska, and then onwards to Kodiak, Alaska, the first time either town had seen an airplane. Yet, tragedy struck on 5 Sept. 1925, when the wind and tide destroyed the plane on the East Chugach Island beach they had made a forced landing the day before. In the summer of 1926, they purchased an Aeromarine 40B and flew it from Vancouver to Ketchikan, but the Merrill-Davis partnership ended in Oct. Russel had accepted the chief pilot position for Anchorage Air Transport, Inc., consisting of two planes, a Travel Air BW known as Anchorage No. 2 and a Travel Air CW, known as Anchorage No. 1.\n\nOn 8 Nov. 1927, Russel discovered a shorter path through the Alaska Range from Anchorage to the Kuskokwim River region. Previously, pilots had to use Rainy Pass, which took twice as long. The 3000 foot pass is now known as Merrill Pass. Also that same month, Anchorage Air Transport built the first airplane hangar at Anchorage. On 19 Aug. 1929, Anchorage Air Transport was sold and joined Wien Alaska Airways, and the Bennett-Rodebaugh Company in forming Alaskan Airways, Inc.\n\nRussel had already made two flights on 16 Sept. 1929, when he took off on a third. This one carried a badly-needed compressor for the New York-Alaska Company mine on Bear Creek at Nyac, near Bethel, Alaska. He was not seen again, though an extensive search started three days later. Finally, a piece of airplane fabric was discovered on a Tyonek, Alaska, beach.\n\nAnchorage Municipal Airport was renamed Merrill Field in the summer of 1930. An aerodrome beacon at the field became the Russel Hyde Merrill Memorial Beacon on 25 Sept. 1932. A bronze plaque dedicated at its base read, \"TO THAT DAUNTLESS PIONEER OF THE AIR RUSSEL HYDE MERRILL WHOSE LIFE'S AIM WAS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AVIATION IN ALASKA SEPTEMBER 16, 1929.\" The plaque now resides in the control tower. \n\n"}

It now is a part of the municipality of Amsterdam, and lies about 3 km northwest of the city centre. Since 2010 Sloterdijk has formed part of the stadsdeel of Amsterdam-West.\n\nNearby is the site of Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station.\n\nTo protect the area around Sloten from the as-yet undrained IJ the Spaarndammerdijk was laid along the south bank of this inlet. In this vicinity at the same time, a dam on the Slochter (or Slooter) river was built, the Slooterdam. Trade grew in the vicinity, and in 1465 a weigh house (or waag) was established.\nA church was built in about 1479; however, it was destroyed in 1573 by the Geuzen, a group of nobles rebelling against Spanish control of Holland, following the siege of Haarlem. In the 17th century the Petruskerk (St. Peter’s Church) was built, which stands to this day.\n\nThe construction of the Haarlemmertrekvaart in 1631 brought new prosperity to the village, and a toll was placed along the towpath.\n\nIndustry grew around Sloterdijk in the 19th century. On 20 September 1839, the first train to operate in The Netherlands traveled from Sloterdijk to Haarlem. The new rail line between Amsterdam and Haarlem ran parallel to the Haarlemmertrekvaart, but for half a century the line passed through without stopping.\n\nFrom 1882, steam-powered tram, and later horse-drawn trams ran to Amsterdam along the Haarlemmerweg. This was the last horse-tram in Amsterdam, and it was electrified in 1916. An electric tram from Amsterdam to Haarlem and Zandvoort ran from 1904 to 1957.\n\nThe construction of the new Sloterdijk railway station in 1956 should have meant the end of the village. Earlier, in 1860, much of the town was destroyed in a great fire, but had been rebuilt. The construction of the Coentunnel and a new business district almost led to the destruction of the entire village, but the Petruskerk and a few houses were spared in order to preserve the town’s history.\n\nThe 1956 station was moved to the northwest in 1985, along a new rail spur to Zaandam that had opened in 1983.Tram service also moved to the new station in 1985. The station was expanded to two levels in 1986 when the Schiphol line was opened, and in 1997 the Amsterdam Metro came to Sloterdijk.\n\nOn 21 April 2012, more than 100 passengers were injured when two trains collided head-on in Sloterdijk. Among those hurt, 56 suffered severe injuries and 13 were in a critical condition.\n\nSince the 1960s, three new business areas have been laid out in the vicinity of the old village. When Amsterdam was divided into boroughs, Sloterdijk became part of the new borough of Bos en Lommer. The business districts fell under the jurisdiction of Westpoort. In 2010 Sloterdijk became part of the new stadsdeel of Amsterdam-West.\n"}

Zürs is part of the Arlberg ski region and famous for its skiing, especially its backcountry skiing and its Olympic skiing champions. Zürs can be reached by car over a road which is rarely closed in winter (if so, mostly due to avalanche risk after heavy snowfall). About four km north of Zürs is Lech am Arlberg, another ski resort which is linked to Zürs not only via road but also via lifts and pistes.\n\nIn the beginning, some of the mountain farmers without an access road lived under difficult conditions in this high alpine region and were often cut off from the outside world. With the construction of the road over the Flexenpass, the village was connected to the road network in 1897.\n\nThanks to the construction of the Flexenpass (1895-1897), Zürs became increasingly popular among skiers. From 1923 to 1931 further hotels and guest houses were built in Zürs. In 1938, the village already had 500 guest beds.\n\nIn cooperation with Emil Doppelmayr, Sepp Bildstein designed the first ski lift for skiers. The construction work was carried out by Doppelmayr with Sepp Bildstein. In 1937 Austria's first T-bar lift was built on the practice slope in Zürs. The new technical achievement convinced the skiers immediately, and during the Second World War Lech built a second lift on the Schlegelkopf. The strong development of the Lech-Zürs ski area with chairlifts began in the 1950s. In 1951, the lift operation at Kriegerhorn was started. In 1957, the cable car Rüfikopf was put into operation and thus a ski connection between Lech and Zürs arose. \n\nOver time, more modern lifts and hotels have been built in Zürs.\n\nZürs is one of the most renowned winter sports resorts in the entire Alpine region and is located in the Vorarlberg part of the Arlberg region and almost directly on the border to North Tyrol. Zürs is part of the municipality of Lech am Arlberg and is one of the cradles of skiing. The first ski course took place in Zürs in 1904, and the first ski lift in Austria was built in Zürs in 1937.\n\nThe place itself is now almost exclusively a hotel village with 16 hotels (most of them with 4 or 5 stars) and some pensions with about 1700 guests beds. Zürs is part of the Arlberg ski region which also includes Lech, Oberlech, Zug and Stubenbach and offers, 87 ski-lifts, 200 km of deep snow slopes and 305 km of ski runs.\n\nIn Lech-Zürs it is also possible to operate heliskiing. In Austria, due to environmental concerns, this controversial pleasure is only possible on the Arlberg.\n\nThe main source of income is tourism. Because of the high altitude of over 2000 mH, the place is free of forest and therefore with a clear view of the surrounding alpine peaks. In addition, there is always lots of snow the Arlberg-region, as well as a picture book landscape for the winter sports. This unique combination attracts many tourists each year.\n\nLech Zürs recorded 844,373 overnight stays in the winter of 2016/17, which corresponds to a minus of 2.5% compared to the previous year. Zürs alone is responsible for 121.729 overnight stays in 2016/17.\n\nFrom 1988 to 1994, numerous FIS Alpine Ski World Cup races have been held in the Lech-Zürs ski area. After 26 years, alpine ski races will be held again in Lech in November 2020. The races will take place on November 14th and 15th in the Flexenarena Zürs. They will consist of parallel ski races for men and women, as well as a mixed team event.\n\n"}

It is not very likely that the enchondroma will grow back in the same spot; the rate is less than ten percent.\n\nBecause an individual with an enchondroma has few symptoms, diagnosis is sometimes made during a routine physical examination, or if the presence of the tumor leads to a fracture. In addition to a complete medical history and physical examination, diagnostic procedures for enchondroma may include the following:\n\n\nDifferentiating an enchondroma from a bone infarct on plain film may be difficult. Generally, an enchondroma commonly causes endosteal scalloping while an infarct will not. An infarct usually has a well-defined, sclerotic serpentine border, while an enchondroma will not. When differentiating an enchondroma from a chondrosarcoma, the radiographic image may be equivocal; however, periostitis is not usually seen with an uncomplicated enchondroma.\n\n\nSpecific treatment for enchondroma is determined by a physician based on the age, overall health, and medical history of the patient. Other considerations include:\n\nTreatment may include:\n\n\nIf there is no sign of bone weakening or growth of the tumor, observation only may be suggested. However, follow-up with repeat x-rays may be necessary. Some types of enchondromas can develop into malignant, or cancerous, bone tumors later. Careful follow-up with a physician may be recommended.\n\n\n"}

There were five escorting English ships under command of Commodore Edwards.\n\nThe next day near Lizard Point they were spotted by 2 French squadrons of 6 ships each. Technically Forbin was the senior French officer, but Duguay-Trouin was the more aggressive, and his ships led the attack and suffered most of the damage, after Forbin had discovered the British convoy.\n\nThis battle was almost a complete victory for the French; the 80-gun \"Cumberland\" and the 50-gun ships \"Chester\" and \"Ruby\" were taken, but \"Royal Oak\" escaped into Kinsale with a few merchantmen. The 80-gun \"Devonshire\" defended herself for several hours against seven French ships until she caught fire and blew up, only three men escaping out of 500.\n\nThere is no unanimity on the number of merchant ships captured. French sources speak of 60 ships out of 80, some British of none at all. The fact that René Duguay-Trouin and Claude de Forbin quarrelled for many years about which of the two squadrons had the biggest role in the victory, points to a considerable number of ships captured. Probably the truth is somewhere in between: Polak in \"Bibliographie maritime française\" speaks of 15 merchant ships captured.\n\n\n80 to 130 merchant ships\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2112713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112713", "title": "Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal", "text": "Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal\n\nThe Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal () is a small network of canals in South Wales. For most of its currently (2018) navigable length it runs through the Brecon Beacons National Park, and its present rural character and tranquillity belies its original purpose as an industrial corridor for coal and iron, which were brought to the canal by a network of tramways and/or railroads, many of which were built and owned by the canal company.\n\nThe \"\"Mon and Brec\"\" was originally two independent canals – the Monmouthshire Canal from Newport to Pontymoile Basin (including the Crumlin Arm) and the Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal running from Pontymoile to Brecon. Both canals were abandoned in 1962, but the Brecknock and Abergavenny route and a small section of the Monmouthshire route have been reopened since 1970. Much of the rest of the original Monmouthshire Canal is the subject of a restoration plan, which includes the construction of a new marina at the Newport end of the canal.\n\nThis canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament, passed on 3 June 1792, which created the \"Company of Proprietors of the Monmouthshire Canal Navigation\" and empowered them to raise £120,000 by the issuing of shares, and a further £60,000 if required. The act stated that the canal would run from Pontnewynydd to the River Usk near Newport, and would include a branch from Crindau to Crumlin Bridge. The Company also had powers to construct railways from the canal to any coal mines, ironworks or limestone quarries which were within eight miles (13 km) of it.\n\nConstruction of the canal was supervised by Thomas Dadford, Jr., and further Acts of Parliament were obtained as the work progressed. An act of 4 July 1797 gave the Company powers to extend the navigation, which resulted in the Newport terminus being moved southwards to Potter Street, while a third act of 26 June 1802 authorised specific railways, and allowed the Company to raise additional finance.\n\nThe main line, which opened in February 1796, was long, and ran from Newport to Pontnewynydd, via Pontymoile, rising by through 42 locks. The Crumlin Arm left the main line at Crindau, rising through 32 locks to Crumlin (including the Cefn flight of Fourteen Locks), and was opened in 1799. In the late 1840s, a short extension joined the canal to Newport Docks, and hence to the River Usk. Because the canal was isolated from other similar undertakings, Dadford was free to set the size of the locks, and they were designed to take boats with a maximum width of ,\na length of and a draught of three feet (0.9m).\n\nOn the main line, railway branches were constructed from near Pontypool to Blaen-Din Works and Trosnant Furnace. From Crumlin a railway was built to Beaufort Iron Works, which was long and rose by , and there were additional branches to Sorwy Furnace, Nantyglo Works, and the Sirhowy Railway at Risca.\n\nThis canal was first proposed in 1792 as a separate venture, to link Brecon to the River Usk near Caerleon. The Monmouthshire proprietors invited their potential competitors to alter the plans to create a junction with the Monmouthshire Canal at Pontymoile near Pontypool and share the navigation from there to Newport. An Act of Parliament was. Retrieved 28 March 1793, allowing the newly formed Canal Company to raise £100,000 in shares, with an additional £50,000 if required, and to construct railways to link the canal to mines, quarries and iron works.\n\nInitially work concentrated on the railways, with John Dadford overseeing the construction of lines from the collieries at Gellifelen to Llangrwyney Forge, and on to the Abergavenny to Brecon turnpike road. The line was opened in 1794, and later served the canal at Gilwern. It was not until 1795 that Thomas Dadford was appointed as the engineer for the canal itself and construction began in earnest at Penpedairheol near Crickhowell. Work began in 1796 and by late 1797, the canal was open from Gilwern to Llangynidr in Brecknockshire and much of the rest was in hand. However costs, as usual, were higher than expected and, in 1799, the engineer, Dadford, stated that further money was needed to complete the section from Clydach to Brecon. Benjamin Outram was called in to inspect the work and to advise on substituting a railway between Gilwern and Pont-y-Moel. Outram recommended several improvements, in particular the partial rebuilding of the Ashford Tunnel. He was also somewhat critical of the existing railways.\n\nThe canal was completed and opened to Talybont-on-Usk in late 1799 and through to Brecon in December 1800. Thomas Dadford died in 1801, and was replaced as engineer by Thomas Cartwright. The Canal Company obtained another Act of Parliament on 3 May 1804, to authorise the raising of more capital, and the section to Govilon, near Abergavenny was completed in 1805, but the company failed to raise the finance authorised by the 1804 act, and so construction stopped. The company then concentrated on running the canal and railways so far opened, and were running twenty boats by 1806, carrying coal and limestone as their main cargoes.\n\nBy 1809 the Monmouthshire Canal was threatening litigation about the uncompleted connection from Gilwern. Help came from Richard Crawshay, the Merthyr Tydfil ironmaster and a major force on the Glamorganshire Canal, who provided a loan of £30,000. This sum enabled the canal company to appoint William Crosley to complete the work, which opened in February 1812.\n\nFrom the Pontymoile junction, the Brecknock and Abergavenny runs through Llanfoist near Abergavenny and Talybont, ending at a basin in Brecon. The canal is long and is level for the first to Llangynidr, where there are five locks. below Brecon, the canal crosses the River Usk on an aqueduct at Brynich, and a final lock brings the total rise to . The River Usk provides the main water supply for the canal. A weir near the Brecon Promenade controls the water levels on the river, and of underground culvert brings water through the town to the Theatre Basin. Additional water is taken from a number of streams, where part of the flow is diverted into the canal and the rest flows under an aqueduct to reach the River Usk.\n\nThe Welsh canals were in the main constructed along narrow valleys, where the terrain prevented the easy construction of branches to serve the industries which were located along their routes, but they had the advantage that their enabling Acts of Parliament allowed tramways to be constructed, the land for which could be obtained by compulsory purchase, as if the tramway was part of the canal itself. This led to the development of an extensive network of tramways, to serve the many coal and ironstone mines which developed in the area. Dadford was an exponent of \"edge rails\", where flanged wheels ran on bar section rails, similar to modern railway practice, rather than wheels with no flanges running on \"L\" shaped tram-plates.\n\nFollowing Dadford's demise, Benjamin Outram was consulted on a number of matters, and recommended that the railways should be converted from edge rails to tram plates. Many of them were converted in this way, but this alteration was not always successful, with users of the Crumlin Bridge to Beaufort Ironworks tramway complaining in 1802 that they had incurred considerable cost to make the transition, only to find that the new tramway was unusable due to poor construction. In 1806, the loaded weights of wagons were reduced, in an attempt to reduce the number of broken tramplates. Ultimately, many of the tramways were converted to standard gauge railways, and so reverted to the flanged wheel system.\n\nThe canal acts obtained by the Monmouthshire Canal Company authorised tramways to Aberbeeg, Beaufort, Ebbw Vale, Blaenavon, Blaendare, Nantyglo, Sirhowy and Trosnant. In some cases, these were named specifically because they were longer than and were not therefore covered by the general provisions of the original act. At least 21 tramways are known to have connected to the Monmouthshire canal, with a further 13 connecting to the Brecknock and Abergavenny canal. Some works were eventually connected to both canals. The Beaufort Ironworks was originally connected to Crumlin Bridge by the Ebbw Vale tramway, but the incentives for through trade which the Monmouthshire Company had offered to the Brecknock and Abergavenny Company meant that carriage was cheaper if the goods originated on the northern canal, and so a second tramway was constructed along the heads of the valleys to Gilwern.\n\nIn 1798, the canal company agreed with Sir Richard Salusbury to build a line connecting his collieries to the head of the canal at Crumlin and Llanhilleth. It was not until 1800, however, that Outram was asked to survey the line. The twin track tramway connected by means of an inclined plane to the existing line from the Beaufort Ironworks. Outram's designs were not followed to the letter, probably to save costs, and he expressed his dismay at this.\n\nIn 1800, the owners of Sirhowy Ironworks were granted permission to exploit the minerals under Bedwellty Common and build a tramroad to join the canal, with the erection of a works (which was later Tredegar Ironworks).\n\nThe Monmouthshire Canal Company's 1802 Act sanctioned the construction of tramroads to places within of the canal, and they therefore built of tramroad from Newport to a point near Wattsville and Cwmfelinfach. The Sirhowy Tramroad from the Sirhowy Ironworks was built by the ironmasters, to a point one mile (1.6 km) from the canal company section. The mile between crossed the land of Sir Charles Morgan, Baron Tredegar of Tredegar House, who agreed to build the connection across Tredegar Park, in return for the tolls for goods crossing his land. This section became known as the \"golden mile\", because it proved to be quite lucrative for Sir Charles.\n\nThe tramroad was constructed between 1802 and 1805 or 1806. Branches would be built to the limestone quarries at Trefil (the Trefil Tramroad) and to the Union Ironworks at Rhymney. Two more branches, from Llanarth and Penllwyn to Nine Mile Point Colliery were added in 1824. A major feature of the line was the 'Long Bridge' at Risca, long with 33 arches each of span averaging high. The bridge was abandoned in 1853, to eliminate the sharp curves at either end, when part of the line was converted to standard gauge, and was demolished in 1905. Conversion of the whole line to standard gauge was completed in 1863, and the Sirhowy Tramroad became the Sirhowy Railway Company in 1865.\n\nThe Hay Railway received parliamentary authorisation on 25 May 1811. Construction of its winding 24-mile long route took nearly five years and the line was opened on 7 May 1816. The tramway was built to a gauge of . The railway adopted the use of cast iron 'L'-shaped tramroad plates in its construction. The vertical portions of the two plates were positioned inside the wheels of the tramway wagons and the plates were spiked to stone blocks for stability. The size of the stones, and their spacing, was such that the horses could operate unimpeded. From 1 May 1820, the Hay Railway was joined at its Eardisley terminus, in an end on junction, by the Kington Tramway. Together, the two lines totalled 36 miles in length, comprising the longest continuous plateway to be completed in the United Kingdom.\nThe Hay railway operated through rural areas on the borders of England and Wales and was built to transport goods and freight. Passengers were not carried on any official basis. The Hay Railway was absorbed into the Hereford, Hay and Brecon Railway in 1860 and the line was converted to standard gauge for operation by steam locomotives.\n\nWith their network of feeder railways, the canals were profitable. Coal traffic rose from 3,500 tons in 1796 to 150,000 tons in 1809, but the arrival of the railways brought serious decline, and in the 1850s, several schemes to abandon the canals were proposed. The Monmouthshire Company, which had become the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company under an Act of Parliament obtained in 1845, bought out the Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal Company in 1865, but the move came too late, and the Monmouthshire Canal gradually closed, while the Brecon line was retained as a water feeder. Control of the canals passed to the Great Western Railway in 1880, and they were consequently nationalised in 1948.\n\nThe section of canal from Pontymoile to Pontnewynydd was converted into a railway in 1853, with the loss of 11 locks, and more significantly, much of the water supply to the lower canal. Following the conversion, the next part of the canal to close was the section from Newport to the docks, which lasted until 1879. The rest of the Newport section, to the northern portal of Barrack Hill Tunnel, was closed in 1930, and the Cwmbran section followed in 1954. The Crumlin branch was abandoned as a commercial waterway in 1930, but was retained in water. In February 1946, a serious breach occurred at Abercarn, from Crumlin, and although this section of the canal had not been used for 16 years, the breach was repaired. However, the branch was closed just three years later in 1949, and the section from Pontywaun to Crumlin was filled in and used as the route for the A467 road in 1968/9. The rest of the canal was formally abandoned in 1962, but within two years, restoration had begun. Funding for the restoration became available as a result of the National Parks legislation. This was designed to help The Broads in Norfolk and Suffolk, but that area was not designated as a National Park, whereas the Brecon Beacons were, and the canal was seen as a valuable amenity in an area of natural beauty. The canal was reopened to Pontymoile in 1970.\n\nThe Brecon to Pontypool section was one of seven stretches of canal, formerly designated as 'remainder waterways', which were re-classified by the British Waterways Act of 1968. Under the act, a total of 82 route miles (132 km) were upgraded to Cruising Waterway Standard. The Cefn Flight of fourteen locks has been recognised as being of international significance, and is on Cadw's list of Scheduled Ancient Monuments.\n\nRestoration of the old Monmouthshire Canal began in 1994, when Torfaen Borough Council raised Crown Bridge in Sebastopol, to give sufficient height for navigation again. The section to Five locks was restored over the next two years, and was formally opened on 24 May 1997 by the Mayor of Torfaen. A new basin at the top of the locks marks the end of the navigable section.\n\nAll of the canal route within the jurisdiction of the City of Newport was designated as a Conservation Area on 21 January 1998. 21 of the structures of the canal now have Grade II listed building status. At the Brecon end, the canal terminates at the Theatre Basin, as a result of a project to rebuild the Brecknock Boat Company wharf, which was abandoned and infilled in 1881. Funding was provided by the Welsh Office, the Welsh Arts Council and various private sector bodies. The old wharf buildings have been re-used by the Brecon Theatre, and access is provided by a new canal bridge, named after the engineer Thomas Dadford.\n\nThe next section to be opened for navigation was a stretch running from Pentre Lane bridge, just above Tamplin Lock, down through Tyfynnon, Malpas and Gwasted locks to Malpas junction, and then up through Gwasted Lock on the Crumlin branch, to the bottom end of Waen Lock. Work started in January 2008, and was completed in time for the Welsh Waterways Festival held at the end of May 2010. The Inland Waterways Association National Trailboat Festival was held at the same time, and a slipway was rebuilt at Bettws Lane, just below Malpas Lock, to enable the trailboats to be launched easily. Bettws Lane bridge was itself rebuilt to provide more headroom for boats, using grants from the European Regional Development Fund and the Local Regeneration Fund. The grants were secured in 2004, and the bridge was formally opened by the Mayor of Newport on 1 March 2007.\n\nThe Trust were awarded a grant of £854,500 in 2012 by the Heritage Lottery Fund, to enable the eight locks near Ty Coch to be restored. It will also be used to train people in the skills needed to restore historic canals, and to enable lock gates to be made locally using traditional working methods.\n\nCommunities on or near the canal include:\n\nOn the main arm:\n\n\nOn the Crumlin arm:\n\n\nMuch of the canal towpath is easily walkable along the entire route. The towpath from Brecon to Pontymoile is passable by cyclists over its whole length. The Taff Trail cycle route follows the canal for a few miles from Brecon, but the path after that is not suitable for cyclists with road bikes. National Cycle Network Routes 47 and 49 follow the canals between Cross Keys and Pontypool.\n\nOn 16 October 2007 a serious breach occurred when part of the canal bank near Gilwern collapsed, causing a number of houses to be evacuated. Eight people were rescued by local Fire and Emergency services, and the A4077 road between Crickhowell and Gilwern was closed, for a period which was expected to be several weeks. Two families were provided with temporary accommodation, and twenty-three hire boats were also affected with cranes being brought in to help them back to their bases.\n\nContractors Noel Fitzpatrick working for British Waterways managed to reopen the road within a week of the breach occurring. British Waterways announced on 5 November 2007 that a 16-mile (26 km) stretch of the canal from Llanover to Llangynidr would be drained completely, so that a full inspection of the canal structure could be carried out. They stated that they were working with boat owners to move all boats to parts of the canal which would not be affected by this drainage, but that the towpath would remain open during this phase. Subsequently, they announced that a full geotechnical survey would be carried out, and that they expected the stretch to be closed for up to a year. Water levels on this section were reduced significantly, but engineers were then faced with the task of moving upwards of 100,000 fish before it could be drained fully.\n\nAt a meeting at Crickhowell on 20 December 2007, British Waterways announced the preliminary results of the investigations: there were over 90 leaks on the section from Talybont to Gilwern, with less leakage on the stretch from Llanover to Goytre Wharf. A press release in February 2008 announced that the total cost of restoration was likely to be around £15 million, with major investment required in the 2008/9 financial year, to repair the breach and to deal with other areas identified as being of top priority. The aim of the work would be to ensure that the canal would be safe and fully open from March 2009, but further work would be required during the following three winters to complete the process. Their actions earned British Waterways the praise of Rhodri Glyn Thomas of the Welsh Assembly, who applauded their \"\"courageous decision\"\" to manage the breach in the way that they had. The repaired canal was officially reopened on 29 March 2009, when a ribbon was cut by Huw Irranca-Davies, the Waterways Minister, and Rhodri Morgan, the First Minister.\n\nThe canal is located within the boundaries of a number of local authorities, and such bodies are increasingly aware of the benefits and regeneration that a canal restoration project can bring. To this end, the \"Monmouthshire and Brecon Canals Regeneration Partnership\" was created as a collaborative effort between the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canals Trust, Torfaen County Borough Council, Newport City Council, Caerphilly County Borough Council, the Forestry Commission and British Waterways. The Regeneration Partnership submitted a bid to the Big Lottery Living Landmarks fund for £25 million, this being 75 percent of the estimated cost of restoring the main line from Barrack Hill to Cwmbran, including the construction of a new aqueduct to take the canal over Greenforge Way, and of restoring the Crumlin Branch from Malpas Junction to the bottom of the Cefn Flight of fourteen locks, including improvements to its water supply. The bid reached the development stage, and the Partnership successfully obtained a grant of £250,000 to enable them to undertake a full cost and engineering study for the proposed community based regeneration of the waterway. The Partnership continues to meet to discuss the way forward to completing the restoration.\n\nRestoration of the top lock of the Cefn Flight (lock 21) was completed by volunteers in 2003. The Canals Trust and Newport City Council made a joint presentation to the Heritage Lottery Fund for £700,000 to restore the next four locks of the flight, and this was granted on 23 March 2007. The regeneration of the Cefn flight (Fourteen Locks) is a separate project from the main scheme; contractors will work down the flight, while a voluntary team led by the Canals Trust and Waterway Recovery Group will work up from lock 3 on the Allt-yr-yn locks.\n\nThere are also plans to connect the southern end of the canal to the River Usk by means of a marina in Crindau. The Crindau Gateway Project is an Urban Regeneration project for the area around the southern terminus of the canal, which has received £75,000 in funding from the Welsh Assembly to consider the provision of a marina as part of the scheme. A link from the marina to the River Usk would be provided by way of Crindau Pill, an inlet from the river which would be made navigable. This would create sustainability for the project.\n\nAs of February 2015, Caerphilly County Borough Council Plan to develop the canal corridor from Fourteen Locks to Cwmcarn Forest Drive, and fully restore this part of the canal with a new marina in Risca.\n\nThe Canals Trust have taken over the lease of the Canal Centre at Fourteen Locks. An extension has been completed, which houses a meeting room (available for groups to hire) and also a community run tea room. The Canal Centre is now a base for the Trust and its restoration work at the centre of the community.\n\nOrganised by the volunteers of the Mon & Brec Canals Trust,\nThe 2010 Welsh Waterways Festival, which included the I.W.A National Trailboat festival was held at Newport at the end of May 2010. Over 30 boats attended from all over the UK.\nThe boats were able to cruise from Barrack Hill to Pentre Lane in Torfaen Borough for the first time in 84 years, using restored locks at Malpas, Ty Fynnon, and Tamplin. Over 15,000 members of the public turned up over the four days of the festival, which was a tremendous success for Newport and its canal.\n\n\n\n"}

Both parties drew most of their support from Ba Province, and one of their stated goals in uniting was to give the people of Ba a single party to represent their interests in the political arena.\n\nThe merger soon began to unravel. On 25 November 2005, Senator Ponipate Lesavua announced that he would play a role in an attempt to revive and reregister the defunct PANU, on the basis of what he said was public demand. The Fiji Times reported on 11 January 2006 that the party had been reregistered. In another development, Lesavua said on 23 January that the BKV had also seceded from the PNP and had signed an agreement to merge with PANU.\n\nIn a further twist to the saga, the PNP, the BKV, and PANU decided on 5 March to re-merge, this time under the PANU banner, with Ratu Sairusi Nagagavoka, the \"Tui Ba\" (Paramount Chief of Ba), as its leader. On 2 March, Fiji Live revealed that officials of the PNP and PANU had met over the weekend at the village of Sorokoba, Ba, to formalize a merger of their two parties. He also told Fiji Television that he hoped the Grand Coalition would understand the reasons for the merger. \"\"In politics there are no permanent enemies and no permanent friends but we hope they understand and they will be informed of the move,\"\" he said. He cited concern at the merger of the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) with the nationalistic Conservative Alliance (CAMV) as a factor in the decision.\n\nMeli Bogileka, a former Cabinet Minister, was General Secretary of the PNP at the time of its dissolution. He announced on 7 March that a letter would be sent to the Grand Coalition for Fiji, an alliance of ethnic Fijian parties to which the PNP had belonged, informing them that the party no longer existed.\n\nOn 24 June 2005, Bogileka announced that the party would concentrate on \"communal constituencies\" reserved for ethnic Fijians. (Under Fiji's complex electoral system, 46 of the 71 seats in the House of Representatives are reserved for voters registered on closed ethnic roles; 23 are allocated to indigenous Fijians). The party was open to contesting other seats also, Bogileka said, but considered it important to prioritize. He said the party wanted to negotiate electoral alliances with other ethnic Fijian parties to secure vote-transfer agreements under Fiji's instant-runoff voting system, and on 13 August it signed Memorandum of Understanding with five other parties, confirming an agreement made on 31 July, to contest the general election scheduled for 2006 as part of a coalition.\n\nBefore its merger into PANU, the party planned to contest the Fijian communal constituencies of Serua, Nadroga Navosa, North West Urban, Bua, Ra, Ba West and Ba West, and the open electorates of Navosa, Nadroga, and Tavua, according to Bogileka. The so-called \"Open electorates\", unlike the \"communal constituencies\", are elected by universal suffrage.\n\nThe Grand Coalition for Fiji, of which the PNP had been a member, said on 9 March that it was still in the dark about why the PNP had withdrawn and merged into PANU. Grand Coalition President Tomasi Vakatora said the move was unexpected and disappointing, and expressed doubts about whether the newly merged party would win any seats in the upcoming election.\n"}

The law was enacted at the height of a public scandal over black heavyweight boxer Jack Johnson's interracial marriages. A 1912 conference on uniform state laws recommended the language adopted by Massachusetts because, among other things, it would enforce state prohibitions against the marriage of \"a white person and a colored person.\" At a conference of governors in 1912 during the height of the publicity surrounding Johnson's marriages, Governor Foss of Massachusetts was one of several northern governors who endorsed the enactment of an anti-miscegenation statute. Vermont passed a similar statute about the same time as Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1912, prompted by the notoriety of Johnson's marriages, a Congressman from Georgia, Seaborn Roddenbery, proposed an anti-miscegenation amendment to the U.S. Constitution in the U.S. House of Representatives. It provided that \"Intermarriage between negros or persons of color and Caucasians ... within the United States ... is forever prohibited.\" That amendment failed to pass, but the U.S. House did pass legislation making interracial marriage a crime in the District of Columbia. As of 1910, 60 percent of states – 28 of the 46 – had anti-miscegenation laws. Anti-miscegenation measures were introduced in 9 states in 1913 and enacted in one of them, Wyoming.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Judicial Court's (SJC) decision in \"Goodridge v. Department of Public Health\" (2003) as the May 17, 2004, date set for the legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts approached, the state Department of Public Health (DPH) altered its marriage license form, Notice of Intention of Marriage, to ask applicants where they intended to reside once married, citing the 1913 law in the form's instructions to clerks. Even before the first same-sex marriages occurred, the 1913 was a focus of debate and national press coverage. Governor Romney took the position that \"Massachusetts should not become the Las Vegas of same-sex marriage\".\n\nClerks in some localities, including Somerville, Worcester and Provincetown, ignored the DPH instructions and granted marriage licenses to same-sex couples that the 1913 law excluded, prompting Governor Romney to call for stricter enforcement and for those marriages not to be registered on the state's public health records. His position was that same-sex couples were only entitled to licenses if they intended to reside in Massachusetts. He said: \"What next, is Provincetown going to start marrying 10-year-olds in violation of the law. ... Are they going to refuse to enforce the drug laws? Will they ignore the gun laws, too?\" Attorney General Tom Reilly ordered the clerks to follow the guidelines issued by the Department of Public Health.\n\nGLAD, an LGBT advocacy group, initiated a lawsuit on June 17, 2004, \"Cote-Whitacre v. Department of Public Health\", on behalf of eight same-sex couples from other statesConnecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermontand by several Massachusetts city and town clerks who argued that they were being turned into \"agents of selective enforcement.\" The challengers argued that the 1913 law violates the equal protection provisions of the state constitution and the United States Constitution, and that the state's enforcement of the statute for the first time in decades demonstrated its animus against same-sex couples. Reilly's brief for the state said the 1913 law was \"an important tool in avoiding a national backlash\" against same-sex marriage and help forestall the adoption of a federal constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, a measure Romney supported and which the U.S. Senate was scheduled to debate the week the case was heard. He disputed the importance of race in the enactment of the 1913 law as well. Massachusetts Superior Court Justice Carol Ball ruled on August 18 that the law was not unconstitutional, since it was applied equally to all couples without respect to sexual orientation.\n\nOn March 30, 2006, the Supreme Judicial Court upheld the law as it applies to marriages of same-sex couples who plan to reside in states that expressly prohibit same-sex marriage. Three justices thought all the plaintiffs' claims failed, no matter their intended state of residence; three thought they failed in the cases of states that expressly prohibited same-sex marriage, but not in all states; Justice Roderick L. Ireland would have found for the plaintiffs. The decision denied the claims of the clerks and all the couples except those living in New York and Rhode Island. It sent those cases back to the superior court so it could consider whether those states might recognize the validity of a same-sex marriage established elsewhere, since their constitutions and statutes had no express prohibition of same-sex marriage. Justice Francis X. Spina, writing for the majority, said that \"The laws of this commonwealth have not endowed nonresidents with an unfettered right to marry. To the contrary, the rights of nonresidents to marry in Massachusetts have been specifically restricted.\" He recognized that application of the 1913 law \"has inevitably fallen disproportionately on nonresident same-sex couples rather than on nonresident opposite-sex couples\" but said that \"Goodridge\" \"does not now compel a conclusion that nonresident same-sex couples, who have no intention of living in Massachusetts, have an identical right to secure a marriage license that they could not otherwise obtain in their home states.\" Romney commented: \"This is an important victory for traditional marriage and for the right to each state to be sovereign as it defines marriage. It would have been wrong for this court to impose its same sex ruling on the other 49 states of America.\"\n\nOn September 29, 2006, Superior Court Justice Thomas E. Connolly determined that same-sex couples who reside in Rhode Island can marry in Massachusetts after finding \"that same-sex marriage is ... not prohibited in Rhode Island\".\n\nIn April 2004, as the dispute over using the law to prevent out-of-state same-sex couples from marrying was developing, a state representative filed a bill to repeal it. Two state senators, hoping to speed the legislative process, proposed adding a repeal amendment to the annual budget measure under consideration in May. The state Senate first backed the repeal of the 1913 law on May 19 as part of that budget measure, voting 28 to 3 just two days after same-sex marriage became legal in the state. The provision was dropped from the legislation when considered by the House, where Speaker Thomas Finneran, an opponent of same-sex marriage, controlled the legislative agenda.\n\nFollowing the 2006 SJC decision upholding the law, State Senator Jarrett Barrios introduced a measure to repeal the 1913 statute in 2007, but the legislature's consideration of the statute's repeal was set aside during the battle over a referendum. Then activity in other states provided an additional impetus for repeal. On May 14 New York Governor David Paterson ordered state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions. On May 15 the California Supreme Court invalidated the state's ban on same-sex marriage, and the state began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on June 17, including nonresidents. The Massachusetts legislature took up Barrios' legislation in July, and the prospects for repeal were initially uncertain, though Governor Deval Patrick and the leaders of both houses of the legislature expressed support for repeal.\n\nThe state's four Roman Catholic bishops asked the legislators not to change the law, as did the Massachusetts Family Institute (MFI). Advocates of repeal made a variety of arguments. Referencing the statute's origins, one senator said: \"This is a very simple law, contrived in shame, and it exists in shame, and we ought to wipe it off the books\". Another said that \"People have become resigned to the fact that all the chaos that was predicted in 2004the sky was going to fall, it would be catastrophicit never happened.\" Others cited the economic advantages of hosting out-of-state weddings, especially those of New Yorkers whose marriages would likely be recognized by that state. On July 15, 2008, the Massachusetts State Senate voted to repeal the 1913 law on a unanimous voice vote.\n\nThe house debated the measure on July 29. One representative predicted chaos in other states if the law was repealed and another warned that repeal might allow non-residents too young to marry in their state of residence to exploit the fact that Massachusetts allows minors with parental consent and court approval to marry. Other legislators noted that same-sex couples who married in Massachusetts and moved to other states were already forcing those states to confront their legal status. The House voted the same day to repeal the 1913 law on a vote of 118 to 35. Advocates of same-sex marriage rights in New York praised the vote. \"Now New Yorkers can drive across the border to a neighboring state and get a marriage license that will be recognized as legal and valid here at home,\" said a spokesman for the Empire State Pride Agenda, an LGBT advocacy organization. Governor Patrick signed the bill into law on July 31, 2008. The repeal took effect immediately. The statute's repeal made the state the second to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry regardless of their place of residence, as California had begun doing in June. Mathew Staver, dean of the Liberty University School of Law, said: \"The door has been opened to export same-sex marriage to other parts of the country. This takes the dam away from the border holding back same-sex marriage in Massachusetts and releases it across the country.\" A staff attorney at GLAD predicted few lawsuits and said: \"States are going to have to sort this out over time, but there's nothing about same-sex couples that creates a new paradigm.\" Governor Patrick said: \"I think other states will make their own judgments, and I expect them to–that's their own business. All we can do is tend our own garden, and make sure that it's weeded, and I think we've weeded out a discriminatory law that we should have.\"\n\nIn October 2008, MassResistance, an organization opposed to gay and lesbian rights, attempted to reinstate the law by referendum, but failed to collect sufficient signatures on petitions to qualify for the November 2010 ballot. The organization submitted approximately 10,500 of the required 33,297 signatures by the October 29, 2008 deadline. The Massachusetts Family Institute and the Catholic Church, both prominent opponents of same-sex marriage and the repeal of the 1913 law, did not support the petition drive. In an email message to its supporters, MassResistence wrote that \"Many people were afraid that if they signed, their names would end up on homosexual web sites and they would be harassed.\" It also said that Catholic churches had been ordered not to allow signatures to be collected, that \"priests spoke from the pulpit against it,\" and that the MFI was \"afraid that if we forced a statewide election, it would be too difficult a fight and they wanted to avoid that.\"\n"}

{"id": "2112764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112764", "title": "Finding in the Temple", "text": "Finding in the Temple\n\nThe Finding in the Temple, also called \"Christ among the Doctors\" or the Disputation (the usual names in art), was an episode in the early life of Jesus depicted in chapter 2 of the Gospel of Luke. It is the only event of the later childhood of Jesus mentioned in a gospel.\n\nThe episode is described in . Jesus at the age of twelve accompanies Mary and Joseph, and a large group of their relatives and friends to Jerusalem on pilgrimage, \"according to the custom\" – that is, Passover. On the day of their return, Jesus \"lingered\" in the Temple, but Mary and Joseph thought that he was among their group. Mary and Joseph headed back home and after a day of travel realised Jesus was missing, so they returned to Jerusalem, finding Jesus three days later.\nHe was found in The Temple in discussion with the elders. They were amazed at his learning, especially given his young age. When admonished by Mary, Jesus replied: \"How is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?\"\n\nThe story was slightly elaborated in later literature, such as the apocryphal 2nd-century Infancy Gospel of Thomas (19:1–12). The losing of Jesus is the third of the Seven Sorrows of Mary, and the Finding in the Temple is the fifth Joyful Mystery of the Rosary.\n\nThis event is frequently shown in art, and was a common component in cycles of the \"Life of the Virgin\" as well as the \"Life of Christ\". In early Christian depictions, Jesus is usually shown in the center, seated on a raised dais surrounded by the elders, who are often on stepped benches. The gesture usually made by Jesus, pointing to his upraised thumb (\"illustration\"), may be a conventional rhetorical gesture expressing the act of expounding text. These depictions derive from classical compositions of professors of philosophy or rhetoric with their students, and are similar to medieval depictions of contemporary university lectures.\nThis composition can appear until as late as Ingres (Montauban, Musée Ingres ) and beyond. From the Early Medieval period the moment shown is usually assimilated to the finding itself, by the inclusion of, initially, Mary, and later Joseph as well, usually at the left of the scene. Typically, Jesus and the doctors, intent on their discussions, have not noticed them yet. From the 12th century Jesus is often seated in a large throne-like chair, sometimes holding a book or scroll.\n\nIn late medieval depictions, the Doctors, often now carrying or consulting large volumes, may be given specifically Jewish features or dress, and are sometimes overtly anti-Semitic caricatures, like some of the figures in Albrecht Dürer's version in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid. From the High Renaissance onward, many painters showed a \"close-up\" of the scene, with Jesus closely surrounded by gesticulating scholars, as in Dürer's version of the subject. \n\nRembrandt, who enjoyed depicting Jewish elders in the Temple in various subjects, made three etchings of the subject (Bartsch 64–66) as well as one of the much more unusual scene of \"Jesus returning from the Temple with his parents\" (B 60). The Pre-Raphaelite painter William Holman Hunt painted a version called \"The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple\", now at Birmingham, as one of a number of subjects from Jesus's life, for which he travelled to the Holy Land to study local details.\n\nThe subject has attracted few artists since the 19th century, and one of the last notable depictions may be the one painted, as a forgery of a Vermeer, by Han van Meegeren in front of the Dutch police, in order to demonstrate that the paintings he had sold to Hermann Göring were also fake.\n\n"}
{"id": "2112766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112766", "title": "The Web of Fear", "text": "The Web of Fear\n\nThe Web of Fear is the partly missing fifth serial of the fifth season of the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\", which was first broadcast in six weekly parts from 3 February to 9 March 1968.\n\nThe serial is set on the London Underground railway over forty years after the 1967 serial \"The Abominable Snowmen\". In the serial, the incorporeal Great Intelligence leads the time traveller the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) into a trap where it can drain the Doctor's mind of all of his knowledge.\n\n\"The Web of Fear\" marks the first appearance of actor Nicholas Courtney as Colonel Alistair Lethbridge-Stewart, subsequently better known as the Brigadier, and acts as a precursor to the numerous later serials involving the UNIT organisation. \n\nCurrently, five of the six episodes that make up this story are held in the BBC Archives. For over forty years only episode 1 of the story survived in the BBC Archives, the others being presumed lost. Episodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 were recovered from Nigeria in 2013, however, leaving only episode 3 missing. The DVD release of this story features episode 3 presented in tele-snap format, with the surviving off-air soundtrack.\n\nFollowing the events at the end of \"The Enemy of the World\", Jamie manages to close the TARDIS' doors, stabilising its flight. The TARDIS materialises in deep space; an unseen entity enshrouds the ship in a web-like substance. As the web clears, the Second Doctor operates a device to land the TARDIS away from its original flight course, bringing it to Covent Garden tube station. The station is in darkness and deserted, with the city outside appearing completely abandoned.\n\nApproximately 40 years after his Tibetan expedition in \"The Abominable Snowmen\", an elderly Professor Travers reactivates a control sphere during his studies. The sphere inserts into an intact robot Yeti from Tibet at a private collection in London and escapes. In the following days, London is beset by thick fog and a deadly web-like fungus begins to infest the London Underground. Professor Travers is brought to the Second World War deep-level shelter under Goodge Street tube station, where his daughter Anne has asked for his help to defeat the menace affecting the tube system. Also present are Captain Knight, the current leader of the military manning HQ, Staff-Sergeant Arnold, who acts as Knight's deputy and Harold Chorley, the only journalist allowed to report on the crisis.\n\nMoving through the underground train tunnels, the Doctor and his companions encounter the military, who are trying to stem the spread of the fungus by demolishing tunnels with explosives. Explosives laid at Charing Cross tube station are neutralised by the robot Yeti by smothering the explosion with the fungus using web-spraying guns. The reappearance of the Yeti signifies to the Doctor that the Great Intelligence has returned and redirected the TARDIS' flight in order to bring him to the Underground as part of its plans to conquer the Earth. Knight, Arnold and Chorley are initially suspicious of the Doctor, Jamie and Victoria, believing them to be responsible for sabotaging the explosion. Professor Travers, recognising them from their encounter in Tibet, convinces Knight that the Doctor will be key to defeating the Yeti.\n\nThe group are joined by Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart and Private Evans, the sole survivors of an ammunition detail which was attacked by Yeti at Holborn tube station. Lethbridge-Stewart assumes command of HQ from Knight. The web expands enormously, engulfing the whole of the Circle Line. Further attempts to use explosives to halt the web are blocked by Yeti attacks, and the military's explosives store is consumed by the fungus. The Doctor discovers a Yeti-attracting beacon at the scene, convincing him that someone at HQ must be in league with the Intelligence. Meanwhile, Chorley, who intends to desert and flee, is told of the TARDIS by Victoria and he rushes off to Covent Garden to find it; the Doctor, Jamie, Victoria and Evans rush to intercept him. When they reach Covent Garden, the Doctor's party discover it to be barred off by fungus. While they are gone, the base is attacked by Yeti, killing several of the soldiers and knocking out Anne and Professor Travers. The Yeti then leave with Professor Travers' unconscious body.\n\nOn returning, the group find Anne unconscious and Travers gone. The Doctor informs Lethbridge-Stewart and Knight about the intelligence and the TARDIS; the Colonel decides to recover the TARDIS from Covent Garden station, hoping that it will allow them to escape. The Colonel leads the remaining troops overground to Covent Garden, while Arnold, Evans and a third soldier, Corporal Lane, take a baggage trolley through the underground at the same time to transport TARDIS on. The Doctor and Anne attempt to build a control box to block the signal between the Intelligence and the control spheres, though the Doctor finds that they are low on components and is escorted above ground by Knight to find more.\n\nArnold and Lane put on gas masks and attempt to go through the fungus blocking Covent Garden with the baggage trolley, but when they enter the web Evans hears piercing screams. On pulling the trolley out on a rope, Evans finds Lane dead and Arnold gone. On the surface, the Yeti ambush the soldiers at Covent Garden. Despite downing several robots in the ensuing battle, all except Lethbridge-Stewart perish. At an electronics store on the surface, Knight is killed in a Yeti attack, though the robots leave the Doctor alone. He discovers a Yeti beacon in Knight's pocket, which brought them to the shop. Later, the Colonel returns to HQ alone where the Doctor finds a model Yeti in his pocket. The Doctor deduces that the traitor in HQ slipped the beacon onto the Colonel and Knight. At that moment, two Yeti break in with Professor Travers, who is possessed by the Great Intelligence.\n\nThrough the controlled Professor Travers, the Great Intelligence explains that it brought the Doctor to London in order to drain his mind of all his knowledge of time and space. Unless he submits to the Intelligence, it will drain the minds of Jamie and Victoria instead. The Intelligence gives the Doctor 20 minutes to submit. Travers is released from the Intelligence's control and is taken as a hostage by the Yeti along with Victoria at Piccadilly Circus tube station. The Doctor and Anne work on the control box further and successfully reprogram a control sphere, which they load into a disabled Yeti to make a covert, voice-controlled ally within the Intelligence's ranks.\n\nStaff-Sergeant Arnold, who turns up dishevelled and bleeding, having somehow survived, links up with the Colonel and Jamie in the tunnels. All three agree to return to HQ to support the Doctor, though they find that he and Anne have left while searching for a Yeti to reprogram. At that moment, the fungus bursts through the walls of HQ, swamping Goodge Street shelter. Lethbridge-Stewart, Jamie, Arnold and Evans meet up with the Doctor and Anne, before the group is ambushed by the Yeti, who herd them to Piccadilly tube station. Arnold slips away and meets Chorley, who has been wandering the tube network and has become hysterical with fright.\n\nAt the ticket hall of Piccadilly station, the group rejoins with Travers and Victoria. Chorley and Arnold appear and Arnold is revealed to be the traitor, having been killed and his corpse reanimated as a vessel from the Intelligence. The Doctor appears to submit to the Intelligence and places himself inside a pyramid-shaped machine that the Intelligence intends to use to drain his mind. Just as the Doctor appears to be about to have his mind drained, Jamie calls out to the servile Yeti to attack Arnold; Jamie, Anne and Professor Travers try to drag the Doctor from the machine against his wishes. After Jamie rips its wiring out, the pyramid explodes and the Yeti and Arnold fall to the floor, lifeless without the influence of the Great Intelligence, which has now been dispersed back into space. Everyone is happy except for the Doctor. He explains that he had sabotaged the conversion headset and would have drained the Intelligence had the device been used – but now the Intelligence is free once more. After saying goodbye, the Doctor, Jamie and Victoria slip away and head back to the TARDIS.\n\n Episode is missing\n\nPatrick Troughton took a week's holiday during the rehearsals and recording of Episode 2. Consequently, the Doctor appears only in the reprise from Episode 1, and the Doctor's first meeting with Lethbridge-Stewart takes place off screen.\n\nThe Tube sets were reportedly so accurate that the BBC was accused of illegally filming on London Underground property. According to the director permission was sought from London Transport to film in the Underground but the fees they would have charged to do so were overly expensive. Several props were reused from the previous Yeti serial, including control spheres and model Yeti.\n\nThis would be the final Doctor Who serial in which 35 mm film would be used for location filming. Starting with the next story, 16 mm film would be used instead.\n\nDavid Langton was originally cast as Lethbridge-Stewart, but he pulled out before rehearsals and Nicholas Courtney (originally cast as Captain Knight) was given the part instead. However, it is an extra named Maurice Brooks who is first seen in the role, his booted feet appearing briefly late in Episode Two. Actor Nicholas Courtney previously appeared in a different role, that of Bret Vyon, in \"The Daleks' Master Plan\" (1965–66).\n\nFor many years only episode 1 of this story and a few clips of the other episodes existed in the BBC Archives. The clips are those that were censored and physically cut from the film by the New Zealand authorities when they purchased the rights to broadcast the story. In October 2013, the BBC announced that copies of episodes 2, 4, 5 and 6 had been found in Nigeria by Television International Enterprises Archive/Philip Morris, and returned to the BBC Archives. Episode 3 of \"The Web of Fear\" was originally among the discovered episodes, but went missing in the months between the discovery of the films and their return to the BBC.\n\nA week before Episode 1 was shown, BBC1 broadcast a special trailer following Episode 6 of \"The Enemy of the World\", featuring the Doctor (Patrick Troughton) warning viewers about the new, more frightening versions of the Yeti.\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in August 1976, entitled \"Doctor Who and The Web of Fear\".\n\nThe audio soundtrack, along with additional linking narration by Frazer Hines, has been released on MP3 CD.\n\nIn 2003, Episode 1 of this story & episodes 1 & 3 of \"The Faceless Ones\" were the final episodes of \"Doctor Who\" to be released on VHS by BBC Worldwide. Episode 1 and the surviving clips were released on DVD in the United Kingdom in November 2004 in the three-disc \"Lost in Time\" set. \n\nOn 11 October 2013, the newly recovered episodes were released on iTunes along with the original episode 1 and a reconstruction of episode 3 from telephotos and the original soundtrack. This version was also made available on Virgin Media's on demand service, together with numerous other stories, as part of the show's 50th anniversary commemoration.\n\nA DVD of the story was released on 24 February 2014.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2112774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112774", "title": "Harlequin (video game)", "text": "Harlequin (video game)\n\nHarlequin is a strategy-based platform game for the Amiga and Atari ST released in 1992 by Gremlin Graphics.\n\nThe game was written by Andy Finlay, with graphics by Ed Campbell. It was produced by Pete Cook. The sound is credited to Imagitec, and was composed and arranged by Barry Leitch.\n\nThe game's tagline is \"Probably the strangest game ever!\"\n\n\"Harlequin\" takes place across multiple eight-way scrolling levels, each one of which is completely unique, featuring different scenery and enemies. Your character, a harlequin, has returned to his homeworld, Chimerica, to mend its broken heart. To do this, he must find the four pieces that the heart has broken into and take them to the central clock tower.\n\nFinding the pieces of the heart involves strategy and puzzle-solving. Almost every location contains switches that, if flicked, can open up new areas of the current level or change things in different levels, creating new pathways through the game and closing others. Completing the game is thus made more difficult, because the game world evolves as the player interacts with it. You don't have to play through the levels in any particular order to complete the game, but you may often come to a dead end and have to retrace your steps in order to flick a switch you missed, thereby opening up a new route. Some levels need to be revisited several times if you want to make progress, and particularly important changes to the game world actually show up on the map that appears between levels, offering clues as to where you should go next.\n\nEach level has a different setting and graphics style. Most of them are quite weird, happening for example inside a giant clock tower, across the rooftops of a city, or in Egyptian or Mayan mythology (called \"The Dream Mile\"). There is a level where you are sucked through a maze of drinking straws (called \"Suck It and See\"), like a bonus level in that it is packed with health power-ups. Each screen also has background music, but some tunes are shared between several screens.\n\nPower-ups include a burger (for health), a space hopper (grants invulnerability and higher jumping), fire-works (a sort of partial shield that orbits Harlequin) and an umbrella that can be used as a parachute. There is also a fish power-up that allows \"Harlequin\" to turn into an angel fish when in contact with water.\n\n\"Harlequin\" is mostly noted for its good-quality graphics and music and the sheer size of the levels it takes place in, as well as some of its twisted humour and 1990's pop-culture references (e.g. The \"Matey\" bubble bath bottles in the swimming pool level).\n\n\"Harlequin\" is set in a world named Chimerica which has several themed locations. Some locations have to be visited more than once to complete the game. \n"}

The league promotes its aims in three areas: education, advocacy, and research. Local branches, many under the patronage of lieutenant governors, complement these areas of focus by acting as a grassroots rallying point for members.\n\nThe Monarchist League of Canada was founded in 1970 by John Aimers and was federally incorporated in 1976. It was established after Aimers attended a 1969 tour of Canada by Lt Col J. C. du Parc Braham, chancellor of the London-based Monarchist League. The newly formed MLC inherited a list of 50 Canadian members of the British-based league and held its first public meeting several months later at Ottawa in June 1970. Within a year, the League claimed 3,000 members and 10 branches across Canada.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, there was a growing mood of Canadian and \"Québécois\" nationalism, and criticism from opponents of monarchy who perceived the institution as an archaic and foreign symbol of colonialism and the British Empire.\n\nIn an effort to create a new national identity, the Canadian government responded by removing some traditional symbols of the monarchy. For example, the Canadian Red Ensign, bearing the Royal Union flag, was replaced by the Maple Leaf flag, \"God Save the Queen\" was replaced by \"O Canada\", the Queen's Printer for Canada assumed a less visible role, and the Royal Mail was renamed Canada Post.\n\nSupporters of the monarchy were alarmed by these changes and formed the League as a lobby group in favour of the retention of the traditional symbols of monarchy and against what it described as \"creeping republicanism\" that would result in the eventual transformation of Canada from a constitutional monarchy into a republic.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the league was heavily involved in opposition against constitutional amendment proposals that would have created the governor general as head of state above the monarch.\n\nThough failing to prevent erosion in some areas, the league successfully lobbied the Government of Canada to maintain a Canadian version of the Victoria Cross as Canada's highest military decoration, and to maintain the Queen's place in the Oath of Citizenship. The league also persuaded Canada Post to issue a definitive stamp bearing the image of the Queen as a mandatory item in all postal outlets (see Queen Elizabeth II definitive stamp).\n\nEducating Canadians about the role of the Crown has long been one of the League's primary goals. As a supplement to provincial educational resources, the league produced and distributed \"Red Boxes\" (modelled after the Queen's own boxes in which she receives diplomatic and state papers), containing information about the Crown and related activities. Production of these toolkits ceased in 2006 to make way for a new wave of educational material.\n\nIn 2006, the league released a 36-page educational booklet entitled \"The Canadian Monarchy: Exploring the role of Canada's Crown in the day-to-day life of our country\" and a new education section on its website.\n\nThe league actively lobbies the federal and provincial governments, individual politicians, Crown corporations, government agencies, the media, and others to promote awareness of the role of the monarchy. This is often in the form of organized letter-writing campaigns or through behind-the-scenes manoeuvring.\n\nSince 2005, the league has been engaged in an active campaign to restore the Queen's name to Canadian diplomatic letters of credence and recall.\n\nThe league commissions a study on the actual cost of the Canadian monarchy every three years, the most recent of which was completed in 2016. The survey is distributed to members, media, and parliamentarians, and it is available for download on the League's website.\n\nThe league is considered by many as being the recognized voice of Canadian monarchism. Often, members are called upon to engage in debate on television and radio shows, or offer commentary on occasions of royal significance.\n\nThe league stages various national and regional social events throughout the year. An annual Accession Day Luncheon is held in Toronto each February to celebrate the accession of the Queen to the throne on February 6, 1952.\n\nThe league has welcomed Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and his wife Sophie, and Princess Anne, giving Canadian royals opportunity to meet its volunteers and members. Individual branches also organize luncheons, banquets, receptions and lectures, where senators, members of parliament, members of legislative assemblies, academics and other prominent citizens participate as guest speakers.\n\nCanadian Monarchist News (French: Les Nouvelles Monarchiques du Canada) is the newsletter of the Monarchist League of Canada. It publishes articles on the activities of the Crown, the Royal Family, as well as the representatives of the Crown (governors general and lieutenant governors).\n\nThe league is governed by a Board of Directors. Since 2007, Robert Finch has been the league's Dominion Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nOther officers include Keith Roy (Dominion Vice-Chairman, Western Canada), Étienne Boisvert (Dominion Vice-Chairman, Quebec), and Cian Horrobin (Dominion Vice-Chairman, Ontario).\n\nThe league sanctions local branches and contact groups throughout Canada to serve as a rallying point for members and undertake a variety of activities in an effort to influence local opinion in favour of the Crown. There are currently over 20 branches/contact groups across the country:\n\n\nThe League maintains an active youth wing called the Young Monarchists. The primary focus of the Young Monarchists is to connect members of the league aged 25 and under.\n\nThe Young Monarchist Group is headed by Dylan Mainprize, who serves as Chairman. The Young Monarchist Group was originally formed by university students Graeme Scotchmer and Daniel Whaley, who started the group when they were young teenagers.\n\nThe league maintains five university branches, one at the University of Waterloo, another at Wilfrid Laurier University, a third at the University of Toronto, a branch at Queen's University and one at the University of Ottawa. Young volunteers play a central part in the regional and national work of the League. Summer student internships have been sponsored in partnership with the Office of the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario in Toronto and the Office of the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia in Victoria.\n\n\n"}

Each Gospel offers a slightly different account regarding narrative details. The gospels of Matthew and Mark identify this place of prayer as Gethsemane. Jesus was accompanied by three Apostles: Peter, John and James, whom he asked to stay awake and pray. He moved \"a stone's throw away\" from them, where he felt overwhelming sadness and anguish, and said \"My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass me by. Nevertheless, let it be as You, not I, would have it.\" Then, a little while later, he said, \"If this cup cannot pass by, but I must drink it, Your will be done!\" (; in Latin Vulgate: ). He said this prayer thrice, checking on the three apostles between each prayer and finding them asleep. He commented: \"The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak\". An angel came from heaven to strengthen him. During his agony as he prayed, \"His sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood falling down upon the ground\" ().\n\nAt the conclusion of the narrative, Jesus accepts that the hour has come for him to be betrayed.\n\nIn Roman Catholic tradition, the Agony in the Garden is the first Sorrowful Mystery of the Rosary and the of the Scriptural Way of The Cross. Catholic tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as acts of reparation for the sufferings of Jesus during His Agony and Passion. These Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ do not involve a petition for a living or dead beneficiary, but aim to \"repair the sins\" against Jesus. Some such prayers are provided in the \"Raccolta\" Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the Holy See in 1898) which also includes prayers as Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary.\n\nIn his encyclical \"Miserentissimus Redemptor\" on reparations, Pope Pius XI called Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ a duty for Catholics and referred to them as \"some sort of compensation to be rendered for the injury\" with respect to the sufferings of Jesus.\n\nCatholic tradition holds that Jesus' sweating of blood was literal and not figurative.\n\nIn the Catholic tradition, is the basis of the Holy Hour devotion for Eucharistic adoration. In the Gospel of Matthew: \"Then He said to them, 'My soul is very sorrowful even to death; remain here, and watch with Me.'\" () Coming to the disciples, He found them sleeping and, in Matthew 26:40, asked Peter:\n\nThe tradition of the Holy Hour devotion dates back to 1673 when Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque stated that she had a vision of Jesus in which she was instructed to spend an hour every Thursday night to meditate on the suffering of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane.\n\nThere are a number of different depictions in art of the Agony in the Garden, including:\n\nA medical interpretative hypothesis of hematidrosis has been advanced in the scientific literature, according to which the great mental anguish that Jesus suffered to the point that His sweat became blood is described only by Luke the Evangelist because he was a physician.\n\n"}

State of Mind is the second studio album by English singer and songwriter Mel B, credited under her full name, Melanie Brown. The only single released from the album was \"Today\", for which Brown completed a two-week promotional tour in the United Kingdom. The single entered and peaked at number forty-one.\n\nAfter leaving Virgin Records in 2001, Brown was not interested working in music again. During this time, Brown was dedicated to television and acting – starring the first season of drama series \"Burn It\", presenting the TV show \"\" and recording the films \"LD 50 Lethal Dose\", \"The Seat Filler\", \"\" and the documentary \"Voodoo Princess\". In 2004, she debuted on stage in the musical \"Rent\" as the role of Mimi Marquez, and this encouraged her return to music. In August, Brown revealed that she was recording her second album, but did not sign with a label. Temporarily, she created her own label, Amber Café, just to release the album.\nWhilst recording the album, Brown stated that she did not want hip hop sounds, but instead focused on acoustic music. Brown had announced that the Grammy-winner Darkchild would produce some songs, but declined to give visibility to her friends, the independent producers Kevin Malpass and Laurie Jay. Brown said \"L.A. State of Mind\" was a personal album with introspective themes and based on piano melodies and acoustic guitar sounds. She revealed that recorded the songs in her kitchen, using only the microphone and some equipment for a few sessions with friends. She performed some songs at various showcases in the United States before releasing the album to test the public reaction.\n\n\"L.A. State of Mind\" was released on 27 June 2005 by Amber Café in United Kingdom. It was released in two formats: as a regular CD and as a limited edition with a 30-minute DVD an in-depth documentary filmed and directed by Mark McConnell, detailing Brown's life in Los Angeles. Brown had moved a few months ago to the United States and the documentary shows their intimate moments in the new country and her personal and professional questions. Ten years later, on 11 December 2015, the album was released in United States and Japan only by Right Recordings with a limited physical edition. On 8 January 2016, the standard edition of \"L.A. State of Mind\" was released in Canada by Universal Music.\n\n\"L.A. State of Mind\" received generally negative reviews upon its release from music critics. Jon O'Brien of AllMusic gave it one and a half star and commented that the album was one of the worst of the decade, commenting that Brown sounds as if she was sore and it seems to recite a poem instead of singing. About the production, he also said: \"childlike melodies and dated production are entirely representative of the amateurish nature that encompasses the album\". Analyzing the songs, O'Brien commented that \"Music of the Night\" sounds like a failure and delayed attempt to sound like Ricky Martin, \"Stay in Bed Days\" was like someone singing Shania Twain at karaoke and \"Bad, Bad Girl\", described as the \"worst of all\", was \"an ear-shatteringly bad stab at '80s electro that sounds like it was recorded on a children's Casio keyboard.\n\nCaroline Sullivan of \"The Guardian\" gave it three stars and commented the expectation for an independent and outside the mainstream album was low, but \"L.A. State of Mind\" \"isn't the pile of scrappy indifference it should have been\", praising Brown's breathy voice. She was positive and chosen \"Sweet Pleasure\", compared the song with \"Justify My Love\", by Madonna, and the ballads of Sheryl Crow. But was negative about \"Stay in Bed Days\", described as \"the only rubbish track\" and appealing by Brown put her daughters in backing vocals singing \"Do I need therapy? Have I lost it in LA?\". Bárbara dos Anjos Lima of Abril said the album is shameful and disastrous.\n\nThe album did not reach the top 100 of the UK Albums Chart, but according to the Official Charts Company, it ranked 453 in sales in its first week with only 670 copies sold. In its second week, the album dropped down to number 1581. Overall, the album sold less than 1500 copies.\n\n\"Today\" was the only single from the album, released on 13 June 2005 only in United Kingdom. It was released in two different formats, one featured \"Bad, Bad Girl\" as b-side and the second included the music clip and \"Music of the Night (Perdido)\" as b-side. The song debuted and peaked at number forty-one, selling around 1,000 copies in its first week. The music video was directed by Mark McConnell and filmed in Los Angeles, California Brown didn't intend to promote the single, performing only on \"GMTV\", on 13 June 2005. Some fan sites chose \"L.A. State of Mind\" and \"Beautiful Girl\" as the favourite songs of fans to become the next single, but Brown opted not to continue promotion of the album.\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"L.A.

This is the first album release on Chisholm's self-founded label, Red Girl Records after parting ways with Virgin Records. The album was a big commercial success in Europe charting in the top 20 in Austria, Germany, Scotland, Switzerland and Portugal. It achieved Gold certifications in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and a Platinum certification in Portugal. The album saw the release of hit singles \"Next Best Superstar\" and \"First Day Of My Life\" which went on to become the most downloaded song for all time in Germany. In 2006, Melanie C announced via her official website that \"Beautiful Intentions\" had outsold her previous album \"Reason\", showing sales of over 1 million copies worldwide.\n\nAfter the release of her previous album \"Reason\", Chisholm was dismissed by her original record label, Virgin Records. The main reason for her being dropped was the disappointing sales of her second album \"Reason\". Talking about being dropped by Virgin during an interview on The Guardian, Melanie C stated that \"[I had] mixed feelings. I knew that they were starting to lose faith in me, so I was actually quite relieved to go. I looked at my options and starting my own label was the most exciting thing\". In the spring of 2004, she created her own independent record label, \"Red Girl Records\", to record and release her own projects, alongside her manager, Nancy Phillips. The name was inspired by the colours of the football Liverpool F.C., which Chisholm is supporter.\n\nThe album was Chisholm's labour of love for a year, and she previewed six tracks on her Barfly mini-tour in June 2004 before going into the studio to record the tracks. Following the release of the first single, \"Next Best Superstar\", the album was released on 11 April 2005 in the UK and some other countries. Later the album was re-released in some countries (with a new song—\"First Day of My Life\"). Chisholm stated in an Australian interview that she was pleased that \"Beautiful Intentions\" outsold \"Reason\". \"Beautiful Intentions\" has received Gold certification in Germany and Switzerland. In Portugal, it has gone Platinum (9 weeks at number 1). It has sold over 1,500,000 copies worldwide.\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Beautiful Intentions\".\n\n\n"}

It was the follow up album to \"Northern Star\". Released on 10 March 2003, it reached number five in the UK Albums Chart, selling 30,876 copies in its first week. Although not performing as well as \"Northern Star\", \"Reason\" has a Gold certification in the United Kingdom, with 101,889 copies sold. The album has sold 500,000 copies worldwide. The album has been released with the Copy Control protection system in some regions. Most reviews for the album were mixed.\n\nAfter the massive success of \"Northern Star\", Melanie C was considered the only member of the Spice Girls to be able to establish a steady successful career as a solo artist. By the end of 2003 she was the only member of the Spice Girls to have a contract with Virgin Records, since all of the rest of the Spice Girls had either left or were dropped by their record label as solo artists.\n\nMelanie C had spent most of 2000 and 2001 touring around the world, promoting \"Northern Star\", planning to enter the studio at the end of 2001, to start recording her new album. During this time, things for her often proved to be difficult, as Melanie was diagnosed with depression in 1999. She later encountered that it was really difficult for her to handle all the publicity and the hard work during the Spice Girls days, a period that she would spend days eating too little and exercise to the limits. At the end of 1999, her depression worsened and spent days in bed, not being able to cope with day routine. After being diagnosed with depression she was prescripted antidepressants for 18 months, dealing with eating disorders and having to face a really hostile media reaction questioning different topics from her weight to her sexuality.\n\nDuring the early stages of \"Reason\"'s recording sessions in November 2001, Virgin Record executives were quite worried about the musical style of the second album, since her biggest hits from her solo album was an R&B single (Never Be the Same Again) and a dance single (I Turn To You), while Melanie C insisted that she wanted to keep making pop rock albums. According to The Sun a record company source stated that “both Mel and Virgin have agreed that she should keep to the rock vibe that helped her 1999 album, Northern Star, do so well. But that is where their agreement ends\". Melanie C had already stated that she wanted to work with new producers, while keeping some of the producers that had worked on her debut album. The original release date for the album was October 2002 but it was delayed till March 2003, resulting in a number of articles in newspapers, questioning her relationship with her record company, reporting that she was under pressure to lose weight. On an official statement published on her site, Melanie C stated that her relationship with Virgin was \"fantastic\", the recording sessions were going well and that she was never forced to delay the release of her second album or to lose weight. During the recording seasons for the album 40 songs were recorded. On 12th of November 2002 the album title \"Reason\" was finally revealed on her official site. \n\nOn January 2003 Melanie C gave an official track-by-track review to the press, revealing the album's track list, which was quite different to the one that the real album finally had when it was released. Melanie stated that she was happy with having some of the Northern Star composers and producers on the new album as well as working with new ones, like David Arnold, Tore Johansson and Peter Vettese. Originally the track list included 11 tracks with the following order: \"Here It Comes Again, On The Horizon, Reason, Lose Myself In You, Let's Love, Home, Soul Boy, Do I, Water, Positively Somewhere\" and \"Wonderland\". \"Melt\" and \"Yeh, Yeh, Yeh\" were last minute additions to the album's track list, while \"Wonderland\" was removed and released as a B-side of the \"On The Horizon\" DVD single. On 23 January 2003 a bunch of journalists were invited to have a listen to Melanie C's new album \"Reason\" and then interview her a little afterwards. Virgin executives stated that they hope \"this will be the record that will crack the USA and rival the Avril Lavigne's of the world\". It was also revealed that there were six versions of the album which all the relevant record company people had, in order to decide which one flows the best. \"Here It Comes Again\", which was actually one of the first songs of the album to be recorded served as the first single.\n\nFor the album and single covers Melanie C and her record label commissioned Sean Ellis as the official photographer.\n\nWhile working on the album, Melanie C recorded \"Independence Day\" from the film soundtrack \"Bend It Like Beckham\" (later included on the Japanese edition of \"Reason\"). She also wrote the song \"Help Me Help You\" for Holly Valance, included in her debut album \"Footprints\".\n\n\"Reason\" was released 10 March 2003. Prior to album's release Melanie C did a lot of appearances on TV shows including \"\" and \"The Graham Norton Show\", while she gave some interviews on magazines like \"Times Magazine\", \"Attitude\" and \"Marie Claire\". She also performed a four-song set at HMV London. The set list included her past number one singles \"Never Be the Same Again\" and \"I Turn To You\", as well as her new single \"Here It Comes Again\" and the album track \"Positively Somewhere\". Promotion also included an exclusive webcast on 24 February 2003 performing four songs, which were the same with the HMV setlist, except from \"I Turn To You\" which was replaced by \"Goin' Down\". During the webcast Melanie C did a 30 minutes interview, where she answered questions from fans from all over the world. She stated that she considered releasing \"On The Horizon\", \" \"Positively Somewhere\", \"Reason\" and \"Melt\" as singles. She also stated that she had decided to leave \"Wonderland\" out of the album at the last minute because she thought it was a dark song, while the album was having a positive vibe. Melanie embarked her third tour named Reason Tour in order to promote the album. The tour started on 24 April 2003 and included 25 shows in Europe.\n\nIn September 2003, Melanie C took part on \"The Games\", a British reality sports game show that ran on Channel 4, hoping to boost album sales, where unfortunately she was badly injured. Her injury changed the selection of the song which was selected to be released as a third single: \"Yeh Yeh Yeh\" was originally planned to be released as single but after her injury \"Melt\" was then chosen to be launched along with \"Yeh Yeh Yeh\" as a double A-side, because she could do a small number of performances and \"Melt\" as a ballad, requiring minimum movement, was thought to be easier to promote. Her injury prevented her from fully promoting her last single and the album further.\n\n\"Reason\" debuted at number 5 in the UK Albums Chart on the issue dated 22 March 2003. Sales started to decline on the second week with the album falling to number 19, appearing to the chart just 3 more weeks before falling out completely from it. The release of the second single On the Horizon on June 2003 boosted the sales of the album just a bit, with the album reappearing on the UK Albums Chart for two weeks at number 81 and 99. The final single Melt/ Yeh, Yeh, Yeh was released with high hopes but didn't help album sales at all. \"Reason\" entered the chart for the last time on 17 January 2004, completing a 8 weeks appearance. Because of the poor sales, Virgin Records decided to drop Melanie C at the end of 2003. In an interview on \"The Guardian\" on 2007 Melanie C stated that she had \"mixed feelings\" for being dropped after the poor sales of \"Reason.\" She stated that she knew that Virgin Records \"were starting to lose faith in me, so I was actually quite relieved to go\".\n\nThe album received mixed reviews. AllMusic gave \"Reason\" 2.5 stars out of 5 with Stephen Thomas Erlewine stating that \"[the songs] are colourless and characterless, sounding as if their main goal is to get on pop radio\" and that the album \"is a real disappointment after the very good, very promising \"Northern Star\"\". \"The Guardian\" gave \"Reason\" 2 out of 5 stars, with Alexis Petridis stating that the album \"settles on a direction, sounds confident and efficient and wrings the last drops of originality out of Melanie C\".\n\nIn 2007 during an interview on \"The Guardian\" Melanie C stated that she thought that the songs on \"Reason \"\"could have been stronger\".\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Reason\".\n\n\n"}

The bankruptcy was brought on by Citron's investment strategies, which seemed to be an effort to earn high incomes for the county, without raising taxes, through risky, leveraged positions in bonds. The strategy paid out at first. In 1994, a cash crunch occurred when interest rates increased and financiers for the county required increased collateral from the county.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, Citron grew up in Burbank and Hemet. His father, Jesse, was the doctor who put an end to alcoholic W. C. Fields's love of scotch. He attended the University of Southern California but did not graduate. The younger Citron made his career in the Treasurer-Tax Collector's department before winning election to the top job.\n\nCitron controlled several Orange County funds including the General Fund, the Investment Pool, and the treasury Commingled Pool. He sent out the county's tax bills with catchy slogans, such as \"Taxes paid on time never draw fines.\" He won re-election seven times; in his last election victory, his opponent, John Moorlach, charged that his handsome gains were the result of risky betting.\n\nAs controller of the various Orange County funds, Citron had taken a highly leveraged position using repurchase agreements (repos) and floating rate notes (FRNs). The loss incurred by the use of these financial instruments reached the amount of $2 billion and was caused by being too highly leveraged for rising federal interest rates. In other words, if federal interest rates had not risen, the massive trading position would have been a substantially profitable position; if interest rates did rise, the trading position would result in substantial losses. In fact, rates rose.\n\nThe Orange County funds, managed by Citron, were worth $8 billion. However, Citron went out to the repo market and leveraged the County Pools to amounts ranging from 158% to over 292%. To obtain this degree of leverage, he used treasury bonds as collateral. Profits of the fund were excessive for a period of time and Citron resorted to concealing the excess earnings. He pleaded guilty to improperly transferring securities from the Orange County General Fund to the Orange County Treasury Commingled Pool.\n\nThe county's finances were not suspect until February 1994. The Federal Reserve Bank began to raise US interest rates, causing many securities in Orange County's investment pools to fall in value. As a result, dealers were requesting extra margin payments from Orange County. These extra margin payments were funded in part by another bond issue made by Orange County; the size of that bond issue was $600 million. However, this fix proved to be only temporary. In December 1994, Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) realized what was going on & blocked the \"rolling over\" of $1.25 billion in repos (\"rollover\" essentially means issuing another repo when the previous one ends, but at the new prevailing interest rate). At that point some claim that Orange County was left with no recourse other than to file for bankruptcy.

It was released on 16 April 2001 by Virgin Records. Following the release of the Spice Girls' third studio album, \"Forever\" (2000), the group announced that they were beginning an indefinite hiatus and would be concentrating on their solo careers in regards to their foreseeable future. Recording sessions for Bunton's first solo album took place from July 1999 to October 2000 at several recording studios.\n\n\"A Girl Like Me\" debuted and peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart, selling 21,500 copies in its first week. The album spawned three singles: \"What Took You So Long?\" (which topped the charts in the United Kingdom and New Zealand), \"Take My Breath Away\" and \"We're Not Gonna Sleep Tonight\". It also includes Bunton's collaboration with Tin Tin Out, a cover of \"What I Am\" by Edie Brickell & New Bohemians. On 7 September 2001, \"A Girl Like Me\" was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), denoting shipments in excess of 100,000 copies.\n\n\"A Girl Like Me\" garnered a mixed reception from music critics. Stewart Mason of AllMusic felt that Bunton's singing voice lacked depth but that it worked with the well-crafted and addictive pop songs, concluding that it \"isn't an album for the ages, but it's better than 'not bad.'\" Timothy Park of \"NME\" said that there were great tracks and Bunton performs them adequately but felt the album lacked ambition or honesty, concluding that \"\"A Girl Like Me\", like Emma, is very sweet but, like Emma also, it has no balls.\" Erik Missio of Chart Attack said he saw promise in the album but felt disappointed by its attempts to resemble the Spice Girls' sound. Stephen Robinson of \"Hot Press\" criticised the tracks for being overly sweet and borrowing from other genres but being unoriginal with them, calling it \"another album to chuck aboard the pop blandwagon.\"\n\nNotes\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"A Girl Like Me\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2112839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112839", "title": "Serbian literature", "text": "Serbian literature\n\nSerbian literature () refers to literature written in Serbian and/or in Serbia and all other lands where Serbs reside. The history of Serbian literature begins with the independent theological works from the Nemanjić era. With the fall of Serbia and neighboring countries in the 15th century, there is a gap in the literary history in the occupied land, however, Serbian literature continued uninterrupted in lands under European rule and saw a revival in the 18th century in Vojvodina, then under Habsburg rule. Serbia gained independence following the Serbian Revolution (1804–1815) and Serbian literature has since prospered.\n\nThe Old Church Slavonic literature was created on Byzantine model, and at first church services and biblical texts were translated into Slavic, and soon afterward other works for Christian life values (including Latin works) from which they attained necessary knowledge in various fields. Although this Christian literature educated the Slavs, it did not have an overwhelming influence on original works. Instead, a more narrow aspect, the genres, and poetics with which the cult of saints could be celebrated were used, owing to the Slavic celebration of Cyril and Methodius and their Slav disciples as saints and those responsible for Slavic literacy. The ritual genres were hagiographies, homiletics and hymnography, known in Slavic as \"žitije\" (vita), \"pohvala\" (eulogy), \"službe\" (church services), effectively meaning prose, rhetoric, and poetry. The fact that the first Slavic works were in the canonical form of ritual literature, and that the literary language was the ritual Slavic language, defined the further development. Medieval Slavic literature, especially Serbian, was modeled on this classical Slavic literature. The new themes in Serbian literature were all created within the classic ritual genres.\n\nThe earliest writings in Serbian were, obviously, religious in nature. Religions were historically the first institutions that persisted despite political and military upheavals, as well as the first organizations to see the value in writing down their history and policies. Serbia's early religious documents date back as we know to the 10th and 11th centuries. In the 12th century the art form of religious writing was developed by Saint Sava, who worked to bring about an artistic aspect to these writings, also based on earlier works, that is still appreciated today.\n\nPost-Medieval Serbian literature was dominated by folk songs and epics passed orally from generation to generation. Historic events, such as the Battle of Kosovo in the 14th century play a major role in the development of the Serbian epic poetry. The epic and lyrical poetry, the drama, and the prose of every class, all alike sound those notes, and the melody is triumphant or despairing according to the period of the nation's struggles against its many invaders. Less perhaps than any other European literature has Serbian literature been influenced by the literature of other lands. It mirrors throughout the simple, unsophisticated feeling and thoughts of men and women who love their country wholly, sincerely, faithfully, and are ready to lay down their lives to preserve its freedom. Here, if ever, the soul of a people is revealed in its most challenging time in history while attempting to extricate itself from centuries of Eastern (Turkish) and Western (Austrian, Hungarian, Venetian and Napoleonic French) oppression.\n\nSerbian literature in Vojvodina continued building onto Medieval tradition, influenced by Old Serbian, Russian baroque and Serbian baroque of Vojvodina, which culminated in the Slavonic-Serbian language. Most important authors of the time are Dimitrije Ljubavić, Đorđe Branković, Vasilije III Petrović-Njegoš, Gavril Stefanović Venclović, Mojsije Putnik, Pavle Julinac, Jovan Rajić, Zaharije Orfelin, and many others.\n\nBefore the start of a fully established Romanticism concomitant with the Revolutions of 1848, some Romanticist ideas (e.g. the usage of national language to rally for national unification of all classes) were developing, especially among monastic clergy in Vojvodina. The most prominent representative of that is Dositej Obradović, who gave up his monastic vows and left for decades of wandering, occasionally studying, teaching, or working in the cultural field in countries as variegated as Russia, England, Germany, Albania, Ottoman Turkey and Italy, and ending up as a Minister of Education in the Principality of Serbia.\n\nAfter winning the independence from the Ottoman Empire, the Serbian independence movement sparked the first works of modern Serbian literature. Most notably Petar II Petrović Njegoš and his Mountain Wreath of 1847, represent a cornerstone of the Serbian epic, which was based on the rhythms of the folk songs.\n\nFurthermore, Vuk Stefanović Karadžić, an acquaintance of J. W. von Goethe, became the first person to collect folk songs and epics and to publish them in a book. Vuk Karadžić is regarded as the premier Serbian philologist, who together with Đuro Daničić played a major role in reforming the modern Serbian language.\n\nThe literary trend of the first and second decade of the 20th century is referred to as \"Moderna\" in Serbian. Its influences came from leading literature movements in Europe, particularly that of symbolism and the psychological novel, but more through mood and aesthetic component rather than of literary craftsmanship. It was manifested in the works of Jovan Dučić and Milan Rakić, the two poet diplomats. The third leading poet at the time was Aleksa Šantić whose poetry was less subtle but filled with pathos, emotion, and sincerity. They were popular for their patriotic, romantic and social overtones.\n\nOther poets such as Veljko Petrović, Milutin Bojić, Sima Pandurović, Vladislav Petković Dis, Milorad Mitrović, Stevan M. Luković, Vladimir Stanimirović, Danica Marković, Velimir Rajić, Stevan Besević, Milorad Pavlović-Krpa, Milan Ćurčin, Milorad Petrović Seljančica, all took different paths and showed great sophistication and advancement not only in their craft but in their world view as well. Most of them were pessimistic in their outlook, while at the same time patriotic in the wake of turbulent events that were then culminating in the struggle for Old Serbia, the Balkan Wars and World War I.\n\nA new generation of prose writers also made themselves felt, namely Svetozar Ćorović, Janko Veselinović, Veljko M. Milićević, and Borisav Stanković with his major works, \"Nečista krv\" (Impure Blood) and \"Koštana\" (drama). Impure Blood is now considered one of the most powerful Serbian novels of the period. His was the world of the tradition-laden town of Vranje, where Slavs were divided among themselves as to who they were -- Serbian, Bulgarian, Greek or the newly-created ethnicity, Macedonian (a resurrected Macedonia of ancient times, no doubt)? This place of merchants and landowners was on its way out together with the retreating Turks from the region, after the long struggle for Old Serbia from 1903-1911 and the Balkan Wars. Equally, Svetozar Ćorović depicted his native Herzegovina, where the shift in the Moslem population during the Bosnian crisis and after was most acute. Simo Matavulj and Ivo Ćipiko penned a landscape of the South Adriatic not always sunny and blue. Ćipiko's lyrical writings warned the reader of the deteriorating social conditions, especially in \"The Spiders\". Then came Petar Kočić's highly lyrical prose and the quest for the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its natural unification with Serbia. In Kočić's play \"The Badger Before the Court\", the Austro-Hungarian authorities are mocked for their proclivity to rule over others, including Slavs.\n\nAll these writers were backed by Serbian critics educated in the West. For example, Bogdan Popović, Pavle Popović, Ljubomir Nedić, Slobodan Jovanović, Branko Lazarević, Vojislav Jovanović Marambo and Jovan Skerlić. Skerlić with his \"chef-d'oeuvre\", the historical survey of Serbian literature, and Bogdan Popović, with his refined, Western-schooled aestheticism, not only weighed the writers’ achievements but also pointed out the directions of modern world literature to them.\n\nSeveral writers from this period -- Milutin Uskoković, Velimir Rajić, Milutin Bojić, and Vladislav Petković Dis and others-- made the ultimate sacrifice during World War I, adding to the enormous toll Serbia had to pay for its hard-earned victory, only to enter into an unworkable confederacy with others that dissolved in 1941 and again in 1991.\n\nIn the 20th century, Serbian literature flourished and a myriad of young and talented writers appeared. \n\nThe most well known authors are Ivo Andrić, Miloš Crnjanski, Meša Selimović, Borislav Pekić, Branko Miljković, Danilo Kiš, Milorad Pavić, David Albahari, Miodrag Bulatović, Igor Marojević, Miroslav Josić Višnjić, Dobrica Ćosić, Zoran Živković, Vladimir Arsenijević, Vladislav Bajac and many others. Jelena Dimitrijević and Isidora Sekulić are two early twentieth century women writers. Svetlana Velmar-Janković and Gordana Kuić are the best known female novelists in Serbia today.\n\nMilorad Pavić is perhaps the most widely acclaimed Serbian author today, most notably for his \"Dictionary of the Khazars\" (Хазарски речник / Hazarski rečnik), which has been translated into 24 languages.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Their music also has grindcore and death metal influences with traditional Finnish melancholy.\n\nMokoma started out as a creation of Marko Annala, who is the band's lead singer, and has been the band's only original bandmember. The name comes from Annala's former girlfriends' Karelian grandmother, who said \"Voi siuta mokomaa\". That means \"Oh gosh, you and your tricks\", basically in simple words when put into English.

However, both albums sold badly and they were eventually dropped when they suggested to their record company (EMI), that they wanted to play something more closer to their hearts, thrash metal. The group moved on and created their own record company, called Sakara Records, and released their third album \"Kurimus\", which is sometimes regarded as the first thrash metal album sung in Finnish. That was the first release of the members' independent record company Sakara Records. Since then they have released seven more albums and an EP called \"Viides vuodenaika\", which reached position one in the Finnish albums chart.

The magazine states that it \"celebrates the traditional myths, culture, and social institutions of pre-Christian, pre-modern Europe.\" The first issue was published in 2002 under the ULTRA imprint in Atlanta, Georgia. The magazine largely focuses on topics relating to Germanic neopaganism and Germanic paganism with an amount of content regarding Celtic polytheism as well.\n\nFour volumes have appeared so far; vol. 1 in 2002 and vol. 2 in 2004 and now vol. 3 2006 is available from the Tyr website or from Norway's Integral Publications. Contributors include Asatru Folk Assembly founder Stephen McNallen, \"Nouvelle Droite\" leader Alain de Benoist, British musicologist and translator Joscelyn Godwin, modern Germanic mysticist Nigel Pennick and scholar Stephen Flowers. The journal has also published translations of older works, such as by occultist Julius Evola and völkisch poet and musician Hermann Löns.\n\nThomas Wiloch states that:\n\n\"Tyr serves as a meeting place for those who see intriguing commonalities between the environmental, pagan, alternative music, and occult communities, and between certain political ideas of both the left and the right,\" further stating that the publication is \"on the extreme edge of things\".\n\nThe reviewer for Northvegr identifies the philosophy behind \"Tyr\" as primarily \"Odian\" (Stephen Flowers' school of occult \"Runosophy\"), expressing concern that the magazine:\n\n..wraps into a round of praise and admiration for the likes of Julius Evola, Herman Lons, and the dark master of chaos himself, Karl Maria Wiligut.\n\nNorthvegr then requests \"firm voices calling out from the side of right and order\" to correct the impression that the occultist \"Traditionalism\" advocated by \"Tyr\" represents a mainstream position in Germanic neopaganism.\n\nA brief 2004 review in \"Willamette Week\" of the second issue said that \"It's hard not to find the recurrent interest in a posited tribal \"homogeneity\" a little discomfiting (indeed, a section of this issue's preface attempts to dismiss \"The Fascist Accusation\" before the fact)\", and summarized the journal as \"a first-class artifact of, ironically, modern Bohemia\".\n\nMichael Strmiska, writing for the Pagan Studies journal \"The Pomegranate\" in 2010 reviewed the first three issues. According to Strmiska, the \"Tyr\" was eclectic and \"difficult to categorize\". Strmiska also addressed the political content of \"Tyr\", specifically saying the journal was not pro-fascist or neo-Nazi.\n\n\n\n"}

It reached number four on the UK Albums Chart. The album saw the group edging away from the PWL sound to a more mature sound, working with producers from Sweden and songwriters such as Cyndi Lauper. This more mature sound was also echoed in the new material from \"\".\n\nEach of the five group members co-wrote a track on the album, each in turn had a chance to have lead vocals in one whole track. The lead single from the album \"Stomp\" is a funky upbeat song that is lyrically about partying at the weekend and having a good time, and features a sample from Chic's single \"Everybody Dance\" The single peaked at number 1 on the UK Singles Chart, making it the group's second number 1 hit after \"Tragedy\".\n\nPreceding singles \"Better the Devil You Know\" and \"Summer of Love\", were included on the album after they were released earlier that year with their double A-side singles \"Say You'll Be Mine\" and \"When I Said Goodbye\". \"It's the Way You Make Me Feel\" was the fourth single to be released from the album and reached number 2 in the UK after copies of the single were released a week early in shops, damaging their chance at taking the number 1 spot; however, this led to the band holding a chart record for the highest chart jump when the track went from number 72 to number 2. \"Here and Now\" and \"You'll Be Sorry\" were the final songs released from \"Buzz\" and were both included on a double A-side CD single which reached #4 in UK. The album was certified Platinum in UK and was released in Australia and US in 2001.\n\nAs with their previous two albums, some cover versions are included on the album. \"Better the Devil You Know\" is a version of the Kylie Minogue track and \"Here and Now\" was originally recorded by Worlds Apart.\n\n\"Buzz\" received favorable critical response from different music magazines and websites. Everyone noticed the group's departure from the \"ABBA sound\", into their own musical style. AllMusic stated \"They (Steps) do in fact have their own sound, and it has revealed itself here, crystal clear\".\n\nThis album saw the group leaning toward a more mature and original sound influenced by electro and techno but still keeping the sound prominent to Steps' earlier work. This is seen as the album plays out through tracks such as \"You'll Be Sorry\", \"Never Get Over You\" \"Happy Go Lucky\" and \"Buzzz\". The art work and overall look for the album is prominent to the sound as their earlier albums had more colour and expression to resemble the enlightenment of the sound of their music. As their sound was more mature their appearances were more sophisticated and showed the progression of Steps into a new era that was carried on into the look of their next album, \"Gold: Greatest Hits\".\n\nIn an interview with whereitsat.tv when Steps were asked if their Pete Waterman days where behind them, Lee responded with: \"We've been under Pete Waterman's wing for a good two or three years and I think with the third album \"Buzz\", we've had an experience and sort of self-expression and things, you know. We've had our chance, we've wrote, we've helped produce and we've got th[ose] songs on the album \"Buzz\". Now that the greatest hits album is coming out, [we're] writing and helping produce for that as well and then there's an album after that. It's almost like leaving an era behind and moving onto something else, so you could see it as a new beginning in a way.\"\n\nHowever, the album is said to be less successful than their first releases, only peaking at number four on the UK Albums Chart and achieving double Platinum status from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI)—\"Step One\" was certified 8× Platinum and \"Steptacular\" was certified 4× Platinum. It is also considered to be their only album to not sell a million copies in United Kingdom, before the group's Boxing Day split. To date, it has sold more than 680,000 units in UK, becoming their lowest-selling album while they were still together. The album also features solos from each member apart from Lee, though he is featured on the song he co-wrote, \"Turn Around\".\n\nNote\n\n"}

In 1988, she starred in the TV series \"Hana no Asuka-gumi!\" as Asuka Kuraku along with Natsuki Ozawa and Hikari Ishida, based on a manga series about a 14-year-old delinquent girl. \n\nAfter playing roles in a number of TV series, Odaka landed the role of Miki Saegusa in \"Godzilla vs. Biollante\" in 1989 (although her character's back story was first introduced in the manga adaptation of 1984 reboot). Toho was impressed with her acting skills and she reprised her role in the following installment and the rest of the Heisei Series. Prior to assuming the role, Odaka had never seen a \"Godzilla\" film, and was initially scared of the Godzilla suit until she befriended suit performer Kenpachiro Satsuma.\n\nOdaka was one of the few actors to play the same role in more than one original Japanese release of a Godzilla film (Takashi Shimura played Dr. Kyouhei Yamane in the first two films, Raymond Burr reprised his role as Steve Martin in the edited American releases \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters!\" and \"Godzilla 1985\", Yumiko Shaku starred as Akane Yashiro in \"Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla\" and returned briefly for its sequel \"\", and finally Momoko Kochi who portrayed Emiko Yamane on the original 1954 \"Godzilla\" film reprised her role in a cameo appearance in \"Godzilla vs. Destroyah\").\n\nOdaka also had a short singing career from 1988 to 1991, which spawned six singles and the two albums, \"Milky Cotton\" (1988) and \"Powder Snow\" (1989). She also acted in several stage productions such as \"Anne no aijou\" (or \"Anne no ai\") aka \"Anne's Love\" or \"Anne's Affection\" in 1991, \"Kiki's Delivery Service\" in 1995, \"Peter Pan\" in 1996 and \"Yana no ue no Violin-jiki\" (\"Violin Player on top of the Roof\" or \"Fiddler on the Roof\") in 1994, 1996, and 1998.\n\nIn 2000, Odaka declined a role in a stage adaptation of \"Phoenix (Hi no Tori)\" at the Osaka Shochikuza due to her illnesses. She then left Toho and announced her retirement.\n\nOdaka was not heard from until September 25, 2010, when she recorded a message for the . Since her retirement, she took several jobs such as office work and cosmetics sales.\n\nOdaka is married to actor and director . Since 2012, Odaka has participated as an actress and assistant director in Ugajin's theater class .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2112884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112884", "title": "FrameNet", "text": "FrameNet\n\nIn computational linguistics, FrameNet is a project housed at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California which produces an electronic resource based on a theory of meaning called\nframe semantics. FrameNet reveals for example that the sentence \"John sold a car to Mary\" essentially describes the same basic situation (semantic frame) as \"Mary bought a car from John\", just from a different perspective. A semantic frame can be thought of as a conceptual structure describing an event, relation, or object and the participants in it. The FrameNet lexical database contains over 1,200 semantic \"frames\", 13,000 \"lexical units\" (a pairing of a word with a meaning; polysemous words are represented by several \"lexical units\") and 202,000 example sentences. FrameNet is largely the creation of Charles J. Fillmore, who developed the theory of frame semantics that the project is based on, and was initially the project leader when the project began in 1997. Collin Baker became the project manager in 2000. The FrameNet project has been influential in both linguistics and natural language processing, where it led to the task of automatic Semantic Role Labeling.\n\nA frame is a schematic representation of a situation involving various participants, props, and other conceptual roles. Examples of frame names are codice_1 and codice_2. A frame in FrameNet contains a textual description of what it represents (a frame definition), associated frame elements, lexical units, example sentences, and frame-to-frame relations.\n\nFrame elements (FE) provide additional information to the semantic structure of a sentence. Each frame has a number of core and non-core FEs which can be thought of as semantic roles. Core FEs are essential to the meaning of the frame while non-core FEs are generally descriptive (such as time, place, manner, etc.).\n\nSome examples include:\n\n\nFrameNet includes shallow data on syntactic roles that frame elements play in the example sentences. For example, for a sentence like \"She was born about AD 460\", FrameNet would mark \"She\" as a noun phrase referring to the codice_4 FE, and \"about AD 460\" as a noun phrase corresponding to the codice_5 frame element. Details of how frame elements can be realized in a sentence are important because this reveals important information about the subcategorization frames as well as possible diathesis alternations (e.g. \"John broke the window\" vs. \"The window broke\")\nof a verb.\n\nLexical units (LU) are lemmas, with their part of speech, that evoke a specific frame. In other words, when an LU is identified in a sentence, that specific LU can be associated with its specific frame(s). For each frame, there may be many LUs associated to that frame, and also there may be many frames that share a specific LU, this is typically the case with LUs that have multiple word senses. Alongside the frame, each lexical unit is associated with specific frame elements by means of the annotated example sentences.\n\nExample:\n\nLexical units that evoke the codice_16 frame (or more specific perspectivized versions of it, to be precise), include the verbs \"complain\", \"grouse\", \"lament\", and others.\n\nFrames are associated with example sentences and frame elements are marked within the sentences. Thus, the sentence\nis associated with the frame codice_1, while \"She\" is marked as the frame element codice_4 and \"about AD 460\" is marked as codice_5.\nFrom the start, the FrameNet project has been committed to looking at evidence from actual language use as found in text collections like the British National Corpus. \nBased on such example sentences, automatic semantic role labeling tools are able to determine frames and mark frame elements in new sentences.\n\nFrameNet also exposes the statistics on the \"valences\" of the \"frames\", that is the number and the position of the \"frame elements\" within example sentences. The sentence\nfalls in the valence pattern\nwhich occurs two times in the example sentences in FrameNet,\nnamely in:\n\nFrameNet additionally captures relationships between different frames using relations. These include the following:\n\n\nFrameNet has proven to be useful in a number of computational applications, because computers need additional knowledge in order to recognize that \"John sold a car to Mary\" and \"Mary bought a car from John\" describe essentially the same situation, despite using two quite different verbs, different prepositions and a different word order. FrameNet has been used in applications like question answering, paraphrasing, recognizing textual entailment, and information extraction, either directly or by means of Semantic Role Labeling tools. The first automatic system for Semantic Role Labeling (SRL, sometimes also referred to as \"shallow semantic parsing\") was developed by Daniel Gildea and Daniel Jurafsky based on FrameNet in 2002. Semantic Role Labeling has since become one of the standard tasks in natural language processing, with the latest version (1.7) of FrameNet now fully supported in the Natural Language Toolkit.\n\nSince frames are essentially semantic descriptions, they are similar across languages, and several projects have arisen over the years that have relied on the original FrameNet as the basis for additional non-English FrameNets, for Spanish, Japanese, German, and Polish, among others.\n\n\n"}

It is the largest such company in the world. It was created on 24 June 2005, following the completion of BAE Systems' acquisition of United Defense in 2004 and its merger with BAE Systems Land Systems. In 2007 BAE Systems acquired Armor Holdings adding to the size of Land & Armaments significantly.\n\nUntil April 2003 BAE Systems was a relatively small player in the land systems industry, however following the 2004 purchase of Alvis Vickers, the aforementioned 2004 acquisition of United Defense, and the acquisition of Armor Holdings in 2007 it is now one of the largest land systems defence contractors in the world.\n\nBAE Systems was formed in 1999 by the merger of British Aerospace (BAe) and Marconi Electronic Systems (MES). BAe's land systems business was RO Defence, a major manufacturer of explosives, ammunition and small arms. MES owned Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd, manufacturer of the M777 howitzer.\n\nOn June 4, 2003 BAE Systems outbid General Dynamics for Alvis plc, the UK's principal land systems business. What had seemed a certain win for the US company was stopped by BAE Systems' surprise move. It has been seen as an attempt to keep such a strong competitor at bay in BAE Systems' \"backyard.\" Alvis and BAE RO Defence were merged as BAE Systems Land Systems. When Dick Olver was appointed Chairman of BAE Systems in July 2003 he ordered a review of the company's businesses which confirmed the attractiveness of the land systems sector. This shift in strategy was described as \"remarkable\" by the \"Financial Times\". On March 7, 2005 BAE Systems announced the $3.174 billion acquisition of United Defense Industries (UDI). UDI, a major competitor to General Dynamics, was primarily a land systems manufacturer, boosting BAE Systems' involvement in this sector and its sales in the important North American market. UDI manufactured combat vehicles, artillery systems, naval guns, missile launchers and precision guided munitions.\n\nBAE Systems Land and Armaments was formed in June 2004 in a reorganisation of BAE's businesses. Land and Armaments, headquartered in the United States as part of BAE Systems Inc., took control of BAE's existing land systems businesses.\n\nLand and Armaments has received regular contracts for the \"reset\" of Bradley armoured fighting vehicles. By August of the financial year 2006 BAE had received contracts totalling $477.9 million.\n\nIn July 2008 BAE failed to win the $1.06 billion MRAP All Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV) contract which will see 7,244 vehicles produced for the US Marine Corps. In September 2009 BAE lost a larger contract, the first stage of a multibillion-dollar follow-on order for up to 23,542 trucks as part of the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles programme. Despite a successful appeal forcing the US Army to reevaluate the bids, Oshkosh Corporation was confirmed as the winner of the £2.3 billion ($3.7 billion) contract in February 2010. BAE announced a £592 million writedown of the former Armor Holdings business as a result.\n\nGlobal Tactical Systems (GTS) was formed from the merger of Mobility & Protection Systems' Medium/Heavy Vehicle business (formerly Armor Holdings) and the BAE Systems Land Systems South Africa businesses.\n\nThe former United Defense business, BAE's US Combat Systems produces fighting vehicle platforms and armaments.\n\nGlobal Combat Systems (GCS) was formed on 1 February 2009 by the merger of BAE Systems' Land Systems Weapons & Vehicles, Land Systems (Munitions & Ordnance) Ltd and BAE Systems AB in Sweden. It also has a 50/50 joint venture with Nexter (formerly GIAT), CTA International, which is located in Bourges, France.\n\nUpon its creation on 2 January 1985, Royal Ordnance plc owned the twelve Royal Ordnance Factories (ROFs) that remained open, plus the Waltham Abbey South site, RSAF Enfield and three Agency Factories. Several factors delayed the intended privatisation until 22 April 1987, when British Aerospace purchased the company.\n\nIn 1999 British Aerospace merged with Marconi Electronic Systems, the defence interests of GEC to form BAE Systems. In 2002 Heckler & Koch was sold to Heckler and Koch Beteiligungs GmbH. In 2004 BAE Systems acquired Alvis plc which was merged with the RO Defence business and ex-GEC plants at Barrow-in-Furness and Leicester to form BAE Systems Land Systems. RO Defence was renamed BAE Systems Land Systems (Munitions and Ordnance). In 2005 BAE Systems acquired the US company United Defense and merged it with the Land Systems business to create BAE Systems Land and Armaments. The former RO Defence business was renamed BAE Systems Land Systems Munitions. In February 2009, it was merged into GCS as Global Combat Systems Munitions.\n\nGCS Munitions manufactures 4.6×30mm, 5.56×45mm NATO and 7.62×51mm NATO small arms ammunition, mortars, and land and sea artillery ammunition. It also produces explosives, guidance kits, propellants, demolition charges, initiators, pyrotechnics, and warheads for missiles, torpedoes and depth charges. These include the BROACH multi-stage warhead produced in partnership with Thales Missile Electronics and QinetiQ.\n\nManufactures \"intelligent ammunition, artillery systems, combat vehicle turrets, naval gun and air defence gun systems.\" Examples include the M777 howitzer.\n\nGlobal Combat Systems Vehicles produces and supports main battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, armoured engineer vehicles, armoured all-terrain vehicles and military bridging vehicles. Examples include the Challenger 2 main battle tank and the CV90 infantry fighting vehicle family.\n\nSecurity and Survivability (S&S) consists of 3 Functional Areas: Platform Survivability (PS), Individual Protection Systems (IPS) and Advanced Materials. Platform Survivability Product lines include armored, crashworthy, and armored-crashworthy seating for aerospace products along with mineblast attenuating seats for vehicles. IPS produces individual small arms and fragmentation protection solutions, such as ESAPI and XSAPI armor, mostly for military customers. In July 2010, it was announced that Security and Survivability will cease to exist on 1 January 2011. The functional areas of S&S will be assigned to Global Tactical Systems (GTS) or the BAE Systems Products Group.\n\nBob Murphy was named president of BAE Systems Land & Armaments Operating Group in November 2009 after Linda Hudson was promoted to President and CEO of BAE Systems Inc.\n\nTom Rabaut was named President of the newly created BAE Systems Land and Armaments, he was previously Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and President of United Defense since January 28, 1994.

It was recorded without a script and broadcast unedited to a large extent. The American broadcaster Fox has earned the licence for Schillerstraße and is to produce its own series.\nThe setting of the show is the living room of the main actor (until 2008 Cordula Stratmann, in 2009 Jürgen Vogel - all the actors keep their real names) who lives on the fictional street \"Schillerstraße\" in Cologne, Germany. The main character is regularly visited by friends and relatives. The participants only know the topic of the episode in advance. The whole plot has to be improvised comically. The cast receive directions from the \"Spielleiter\" (game master) on their headphones, and have to follow the cues, e.g. \"Cordula: Tell the others you're pregnant!\". The show mostly airs unedited and things that go wrong are not removed, either.\n\nThe main cast have included Cordula Stratmann, Annette Frier, Martin \"Maddin\" Schneider, Michael Kessler and Ralf Schmitz. They interchange with dozens of other guests.\n\nThe show was created by Maike Tatzig who is also the show's executive producer. In September 2005 she took over the task of the game master, after Georg Uecker left or had to leave the show for unknown reasons.\n\nThe show is produced by \"Hurricane Fernsehproduktion GmbH\".\n\n\"Schillerstraße\" first aired on 3 September 2004 on the German TV channel Sat.1.

On 26 January 2007 \"Schillerstraße\" got a new slot during Friday evening prime time and started with a special 90-minute 100th episode broadcast in which the actors and the game master Maike Tatzig looked back at the previous 99 episodes. The former game master Georg Uecker was not mentioned once; instead they decided to make it look like Maike Tatzig had been the game master since the beginning of the show.\n\nAfter Uecker left the show, producer Maike Tatzig became the game master in autumn 2005, officially due to schedule problems of Uecker.\n\nOn 20 April 2006 the stage was extended.

In the east and north, Donaustadt shares the Marchfeld. Overall, about 59 percent of the district's territory is in green areas, making 30 percent of Vienna's green space lie in the 22nd District.\n\nBy Danube regulation, in 1870-75, the territory of the present district was radically changed. The Danube had originally spread out in numerous arms, so she was now forced in a wide bed. As the flood threat has not been fully defused, during 1972 to 1987, a side channel (as the \"New Danube\") was built parallel to the river, creating the long, thin Donauinsel (Danube Island) between the Danube and the New Danube.\n\nThe former Danube flood plain is now controlled in the 4 branches, or fingers, of the river, as they separate and then rejoin, all within Vienna, along the southwest edge of Donaustadt. The 4 branches are (from west to east): the Danube Canal (German: \"Donaukanal\"), the main Danube, the New Danube (\"Neue Donau\"), and the Old Danube (\"Alte Donau\").\n\nThe district is made up of eight territories (former villages), whose individual coats of arms make up the coat of arms for the whole district. In the current scheme, the district is divided into those official sub-sections (German: \"Bezirksteile\").\n\nThe eight district parts are:\n\nIn addition to these eight territories, Donaustadt also contains a ninth area, Donau City (officially part of Kaisermühlen), which is between the Alte Donau (\"Old Danube\") and Neue Donau (\"New Danube\"). It was constructed recently, consisting of many modern buildings and skyscrapers, of which most contain offices. In addition, another area of Donaustadt, Lobau, contains a large forest and meadow. Altogether, about 59% of the district is greenery, which is 30% of all the green spaces in all of Vienna. The area went through a dramatic change as a result of the 1870–1875 legislation Wiener Donauregulierung. Were the original Danube to branch out into its many arms, it would take up a considerable area. In order to control the danger of the Danube flooding over, a side channel (as the \"New Danube\") was built parallel to the river, creating the Donauinsel between the Danube and the New.\n\nThe area of the Donaustadt District was primarily shaped by the river Danube, which, over time, formed terraces. Especially during the Ice Age, frost came through to form large debris dimensions, by the Danube in the Vienna Basin. In the warm phase, in the section following the Danube, gravel terraces formed out in the district area, dividing the near Danube \"zone of recent meander\" and the higher-lying Prater Terrace. The slightly higher-lying terrace Prater comes from the \"Würmeiszeit\" (the most recent ice-age); the underlying terrace was created after the Ice Age. For older terraces, the intensive weathering is characteristic, with a layer of loess or clay. On the surface, DonauStadt has of gravel. This is composed of sandy Central and Grobkiesen together, which through the Danube have been deposited. The plattigen stones are usually sandstone from the nearby Vienna. The round Gerölle consist mostly of crystalline rocks such as granite, gneiss, crystal, etc. The granite comes just as the black amphibolite from the Bohemian mass. The greenish-gray gneiss was up from the Central Alps and the Czech mass removed. Further round to oval Kiese consist of limestone and comes from the Northern Limestone Alps. Below the gravel, saturated with groundwater, are sands of the Pannon iums, which were deposited here over 9.7 to 8 million years ago. In several kilometers deep (a few miles), the foothills of the Northern Limestone Alps include shifts from the Mesozoic, which have gas and oil about three kilometers deep (2 miles).\n\nThe developed area of Donaustadt covers 25.0% (Vienna citywide: 33.32%) of the district area, but this is the second-lowest value of a municipality in Vienna. The developed area itself is distributed as 57.4% to 28.4% as residential versus other. Donaustadt thus has a very high proportion of residences. The proportion of land to the cultural, religious, sporting or public sector are dedicated, coincides with 6.0% share. Greenspaces in Donaustadt took a total share of 58.4%. Nearly 51.9% of that green space is accounted for by agricultural land, a value only Favoriten and Floridsdorf exceeded. The bulk of the remaining green areas account for 25.71% as forests (in Lobau) or 13.45% in meadows. With a share of 8.60% of the district area, surface waters take a very high priority in use. Here the waters of the Danube and its Bayou are crucial. The proportion of trafficked area at the district is 8.02%, with the second-lowest value in Vienna.\n\nThe former villages of Aspern and Essling are known as the place where Archduke Charles of Austria defeated Napoleon Bonaparte's French army in 1809, at the Battle of Aspern-Essling. On essentially the same ground, Napoleon defeated the Austrian army two months later in the Battle of Wagram, which ended the war in a French victory.\n\nThe relatively young district (compared to the others, at least) was formed by a resolution of the Vienna Landtag on June 29, 1946. The resolution was supposed to restore the borders between Vienna and Lower Austria. However, due to the occupation by the Russians, the resolution could not immediately take effect. In 1954, the Russians finally accepted the re-districting proposal, and the resolution took effect on July 2, 1954.\n\nThe district area, of Donaustadt, had the largest population growth of all districts in Vienna. Due to the large size of today's district area and the history of horticultural or agricultural, large areas for a progressive urbanization are available. The protection of the forested Lobau section, a large share of the district land area, has limited the level of urbanization at the same time. Even before incorporation, the autonomous communities still had very high growth rates. Between 1869 and the year 1910, the population had already increased 8-fold. Up to 1939 the strong growth had continued, doubling again. After a stagnation in the 1940s and 1950s, high growth recommenced in the 1960s, which until now, is among the highest of all municipal districts. Donaustadt reached a high growth rate, in 2006, with a population of 148,980 people, making it the district with the second largest population. Nevertheless, the district is still relatively sparsely populated. With 1,420 inhabitants per square kilometer (2005), only the district Hietzing was more sparsely populated.\n\nIn Donaustadt, the population in 2005 was younger on average than in Vienna as a whole. 18.0% of the district's population were children under 15 years, the highest value in Vienna (citywide 14.6%).
