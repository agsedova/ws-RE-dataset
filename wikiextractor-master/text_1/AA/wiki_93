{"id": "1904536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904536", "title": "Cave Story", "text": "Cave Story\n\nIndependent developer Nicalis worked with Amaya to port the game to WiiWare and DSiWare in 2010. An enhanced version, Cave Story+, was released for Steam in November 2011, and for the Nintendo 3DS in October 2012. A 3D remake of the game, titled Cave Story 3D, was developed by Nicalis and published by NIS America for the Nintendo 3DS in November 2011. A port of \"Cave Story+\" for the Nintendo Switch was released in June 2017.\n\nThe fast-paced gameplay of \"Cave Story\" revolves around Quote, a robot who wakes up suffering amnesia who must explore and blast his way through cavernous areas in order to figure out who he is and what he is and his backstory. The character gains access to new areas as he powers up his weapons and solves various platforming puzzles. Quote speaks to non-player characters scattered around the game world in order to learn more and more about the world and its inhabitants.\n\nThe player controls the on-screen character directly using the keyboard or gamepad. The player progresses by navigating platform game puzzles and shooting enemies with the equipped weapon. When the player collects multiple weapons, they may be toggled at any time with the press of a button. Defeating enemies sometimes yield yellow triangular objects, which give experience points to weapons when collected. Weapons may be improved up to level three, but taking damage causes weapons to lose experience and levels. Health and missile capacity upgrades are scattered throughout the game world. The player must interact with a variety of non-player characters and objects to complete the game.\n\n\"Cave Story\" takes place within the cavernous interior of a floating island. The island is populated by Mimigas, a race of sentient, rabbit-like creatures. A particular species of red flower that grows in the island causes the normally peaceful Mimigas to fall into a violent frenzy when ingested. The island also conceals an artifact called the Demon Crown, which has vast magical powers. An army of robot soldiers was sent to the floating island on a military expedition, seeking to harness the Demon Crown as a weapon for wars on the surface world. These robots slaughtered Mimigas indiscriminately in their search for the crown, but were defeated when the Mimigas decided to eat the red flowers as a last resort. Shortly before the game begins, Professor Booster, the Sakamoto family, and various assistants formed a scientific party to research the island, but they became stranded when their medical doctor managed to acquire the Crown: he then forced the expedition to search for the red flowers.\n\nThe character awakens in a cave with no memory of how he came to be there. He finds a village of Mimigas, who are being persecuted by the Doctor. The Doctor's servants Misery and Balrog are looking for Sue Sakamoto, a girl who had been transformed into a Mimiga. Not finding her, they mistakenly abduct another Mimiga named Toroko instead. The player finds Sue in the Egg Corridor, where she discovers the eggs of a Sky Dragon, which could allow her to escape the floating island if hatched. Sue attempts to rescue her brother Kazuma, but King, the leader of Mimiga Village, captures her and holds her responsible for Toroko's kidnapping. Sue tasks the player with retrieving Kazuma from Grasstown. After freeing him, they meet Professor Booster, who reveals that the Doctor plans to use the red flowers on Mimigas to create an army to take over the surface world. Booster sends the player to the Sand Zone to destroy the red flowers before the Doctor can find them. While there, the player meets Curly Brace, a female robot who also has no memories of her past, and Jenka, an old witch who is Misery's mother and guardian of the red flowers. Jenka calls the player character a \"soldier from the surface\", one of many who were sent to the island to slaughter the Mimigas. Balrog manages to steal the key to the warehouse containing the red flowers from Jenka, who urges the player to stop them. Before the player can reach the warehouse, however, the Doctor force-feeds the captured Toroko a red flower and gravely injures King, leaving the player to fight the rabid Toroko, who ultimately dies.\n\nMisery banishes the player to the Labyrinth deep inside the island as punishment for interfering with the Doctor's plans. Curly Brace has also been thrown into the Labyrinth and they cooperate to escape. Balrog helps them to move the boulder blocking the exit, revealing his kind nature. The pair find and defeat the Core, a magical creature whose power keeps the island afloat. However, the Doctor steps in to save it before the island collapses. Depending on certain conditions, the player may rescue Curly Brace, who had sacrificed her air tank to save the player character. When he returns to Mimiga Village, he finds that the Doctor has captured the Mimigas. In the Egg Corridor, Kazuma offers the player a choice to escape the island with him using a Sky Dragon, leading to an alternate ending in which the Doctor conquers the surface world while Kazuma and the player hide in the mountains. The player may instead choose to confront the Doctor and destroy the island's Core, which would return the Mimigas to normal. The player scales the outer wall of the island to reach the Plantation where the Doctor is using the Mimigas as slave laborers to grow red flowers. The Doctor's servants capture the player and place him in a jail cell with Sue. She is taken away before the player wakes up, but her letter reveals that the Doctor was a member of the research expedition that included Sue's family and Professor Booster, but he betrayed them once he found the Demon Crown. Sue directs the player to find her mother who may have a plan to stop the Doctor.\n\nIf the player saved Curly Brace earlier, the player may find an item to restore her memories. She remembers that the player character's name is Quote, and that they were not the killer robots who slaughtered Mimigas in the past. Instead, they were sent to destroy the Demon Crown to prevent its power from falling into the wrong hands. Quote finds Sue's mother, Momorin, who is building a rocket that will allow access to the top of the island where the Doctor resides. After helping her complete the rocket, Quote confronts Misery and the Doctor. The Doctor has purified the essence of the red flowers into a crystal, which allows him to survive even after Quote destroys his body. The Doctor's spirit possesses the Core of the island, but Quote succeeds in destroying that as well, causing the island to begin falling to Earth. Should the player have saved Curly, restored her memories and acquired the Booster V2.0 from Professor Booster, they may proceed into a bonus stage called the Bloodstained Sanctuary where Curly can be found and rescued; it is also here that Ballos—creator of the Demon Crown and Jenka's younger brother—is imprisoned. A powerful wizard who went insane and destroyed his homeland after being tortured by a jealous king, Ballos was sealed deep within the island by his sister. At some point, his niece Misery forced him to create the demon crown, but she and Balrog became cursed to serve whoever possessed it. Additionally, it is stated via narration that the Demon Crown will repair itself if it is destroyed, and will only truly lose its power if Ballos is killed, necessitating that Quote and Curly take his life.\n\nWith the help of Curly Brace, Quote defeats Ballos and stops the source of the negative energy that was causing the island to fall, saving its inhabitants. Balrog saves the two before they are crushed by Ballos' collapsing prison—he had been sent by Misery as thanks for breaking her curse. Quote, Curly Brace, and Balrog leave the island to live out their days in peace.\n\nDaisuke \"Pixel\" Amaya developed \"Cave Story\" in his free time over five years. He began the project when he was in college and continued working on it after getting a job as a software developer. He started by writing the title screen music and programming rudimentary character movements. The idea for the cave setting evolved spontaneously when he created a number of enclosed spaces. Amaya admitted this lack of planning caused \"problems down the line\" because he did not have dedicated map editing and data management tools. Amaya describes the game as having an \"old-fashioned feel\", reminiscent of the games he played as a child, like \"Metroid\". More importantly, this \"retro\" design choice allowed him to create a large amount of art on his own, which would have been impossible for a 3D game.\n\nAt a Game Developers Conference project post-mortem, he emphasized the role of pragmatic design in shaping the game. While designing the main character, \"Quote\", Amaya drew inspiration from the plumber Mario's iconic original appearance—a large, expressive face and a high contrast between his white skin and red shirt make him stand out from the dark cave backgrounds. Most other characters feature either light skin or white clothes for the same reason. To make levels memorable, Amaya designed them around a single theme, such as \"warmth\" for the Egg Corridor, and \"arid and oppressive\" for the Sand Zone. Instead of a tutorial level, a concept Amaya dislikes, the first level of the game gives the player two paths, one of which is blocked off until retrieving an item from the other path. This setup, inspired by the opening of \"Metroid\", \"lets players feel like they've solved problems on their own\" and persists throughout the game. In beta versions of the game, all the enemies were shaped like bars of soap, a concept that evolved into the \"Balrog\" character. There was also a \"frog prince\" character who could travel through water more easily. Elements of this beta were incorporated into the Nintendo 3DS version of the game.\n\n\"Cave Story\" has been ported to Linux, Haiku OS, AROS, MorphOS, AmigaOS 4 and Mac OS X operating systems, PlayStation Portable, Xbox, Dreamcast, Sega Genesis, GP2X, GP2X Wiz, and the TI graphing calculator. An enhanced port, featuring updated character designs, remixed music and extra game modes, was developed by Nicalis and released on WiiWare on 22 March 2010 in North America and 10 December 2010 in Europe. Nicalis also ported the game to DSiWare on 29 November 2010 in North America and 22 November 2011 in Japan. Although it does not feature the enhanced graphics and sound or some of the extra modes from the Wii version, it does include the Sanctuary Attack mode. There is also a free/libre SDL-based recreation of the original game engine, titled NXEngine, made by programmer Caitlin Shaw, which allows for extended modification of the game, and the creation of ports for additional devices. The game was released for the Nintendo 3DS's Nintendo eShop service (separate from the retail 3DS game) in the United States on 4 October 2012 and in Europe on 1 May 2014. This version includes the DSiWare version's Jukebox mode, as well as all the additional modes included in \"Cave Story+\".\n\nAn enhanced PC version titled \"Cave Story+\" was released by Nicalis on the Steam service on 22 November 2011. \"Cave Story+\" features an alternative script that differs from the original English translation. This version contains all the additional modes from the WiiWare version, a remastered soundtrack, as well as the option to toggle the style of graphics between the classic style and that of the WiiWare version and the music of the original game, the WiiWare port, or the 3DS update. It also features an exclusive 'Wind Fortress' level. The game got an update that added an exclusive Machine Gun Challenge. The game was included as a bonus game in the Humble Indie Bundle 4 sale in December 2011, Humble Bundle 7 in December 2012, and was released on the Desura service in April 2012. On 19 January 2017, Nicalis announced a port of Cave Story+ on the Nintendo Switch, which released on 20 June 2017. This version is packaged with a full-color manual for the game and a Mini CD containing arrangements of the game's soundtrack made in FamiTracker, a chiptune music tracker based on the Famicom's synthesizers; a later update also added two-player cooperative gameplay. Additionally, GameStop purchases of the Nintendo Switch version include one of three keychains modeled after Quote, Curly, and Balrog. \n\n\"Cave Story 3D\" is a 3D version of the game developed by Nicalis and published by NIS America as a retail title for the Nintendo 3DS. It was released on 8 November 2011 in North America, 11 November 2011 in Europe and 26 July 2012 in Japan. The game was built from scratch using 3D character models, featuring a dynamic camera system and another additional level, as well as a remixed soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky. The Japanese version features crossover content from various NIS and other companies' franchises such as \"Crazy Climber\", \"Ikki\", and \"Dragon Slayer\". In order to devote more time to perfecting the title, Amaya quit his job as a software developer to become director of \"Cave Story 3D\". He remarked that the transition to 3D was difficult because it required the consideration of so many more details.\n\nThe original \"Cave Story\" earned widespread critical acclaim. 1UP.com described it as \"so massive that it rivals modern [Game Boy Advance] \"Castlevania\" and \"Metroid\" games in terms of scope and play time\". Matt Miller of \"Game Informer\" observed that \"Cave Story\" combines elements of \"Metroid\", \"Ninja Gaiden\", \"Mega Man\", \"The Legend of Zelda\", and \"Castlevania\" into an \"engrossing, challenging, and quite lengthy\" whole. Inside Mac Games ascribed the game's popularity to its \"polished feel, engaging storyline, and compelling artwork\". \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" stated that \"the burgeoning Western indie game scene owes a tremendous debt to Japanese pioneers like Studio Pixel, whose freeware hit \"Cave Story\" proved that with sufficient vision, skill, and passion, a single developer can still craft a deep, compelling action game\". Jonathan Holmes of \"Destructoid\" compared the game design to that of Shigeru Miyamoto in its ability to teach without tutorials, like at the beginning of \"Super Mario Bros.\" In July 2006, \"Cave Story\" earned 1st place in \"Super PLAY\"'s list of the 50 best freeware games of all time. In July 2015, the game placed 14th on USgamer's The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list.\n\nThe WiiWare version has received mostly positive reviews, with the central criticism being the 1200 Wii Point price tag (US$12, £10), after years of free play. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com commended the graphical update, which \"sacrifices none of [the game's] classic-influenced charm\". He also remarked that the Classic Controller and Wii Remote are superior to the keyboard input of the PC original. On the issue of price, he explained that \"the prospect of Amaya finally earning a little something for the hard work he invested in this masterpiece strikes me as satisfyingly poetic\" and \"absolutely worth your money\". John Teti of Eurogamer had similar sentiments, but also noted the technical issues with the remixed music, recommending the original soundtrack. \"Edge\" compared the remake to \"\", satisfying both modern tastes with its graphical overhaul and old school fans with the option to switch to the original graphics. Daemon Hatfield of IGN felt that \"Cave Story\" \"belongs on a Nintendo system\" and noted gameplay similarities to \"Blaster Master\", in which damage reduces the power of weapons as well. \"Cave Story\" was nominated for Game of the Year at the 2010 \"Nintendo Power\" Awards, as well as WiiWare Game of the Year.\n\nCriticism of \"Cave Story 3D\" echoed that of the WiiWare version. Many reviewers cautioned that the graphical update does not justify the $40 initial price point, especially with cheaper or free versions of the game available through download services. Parish defended the release, deriving satisfaction from the game's availability as a physical cartridge. Holmes praised the dynamic camera system and new graphics, comparing them to Disney films. He considers this release to be the \"best version of the game, [but] not necessarily the definitive version\". Jane Douglas of GameSpot felt that the 3DS Circle Pad was a comfortable fit for the game's control scheme. Audrey Drake of IGN noted that the 3D effect made it difficult to distinguish certain platforms between background and foreground, a complaint shared by Douglas. Simon Parkin of the UK \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" was more critical, citing lack of detail in the 3D models and a too-dark color palette. Japanese magazine \"Famitsu Weekly\"s four reviewers scored it 7, 7, 8, and 8 points out of 10 to a total of 30 out of 40 points, indicating average reviews. This version was nominated for Best Adventure Game at the 2011 \"Nintendo Power\" Awards.\n\n, \"Cave Story+\" has sold an estimated 590,104 digital units on Steam.\n\nQuote appears as a downloadable character in \"\". Curly Brace appears as a bonus playable character in \"1001 Spikes\". Both Curly Brace and Quote appear as playable characters in the crossover fighting game \"Blade Strangers\". Quote, Curly Brace and Ballos are featured as playable characters in Nicalis' puzzle game \"Crystal Crisis\". Quote's hat is also featured in the game \"Terraria\".\n\n\"Cave Story\" is considered to be one of the most influential video games to be released between the mid-2000s and the mid-2010s. The game had an impact on the indie game industry, with its acclaim and success demonstrating that a one-person team could rival major studios. It is also one of the most internationally successful Japanese indie (dōjin soft) games, and contributed to the resurgence of the Metroidvania genre. The game's critical acclaim demonstrated the scope of what one person could do, and highlighted another take on the Metroidvania genre. It also vitalized the 2D platform game genre as a viable indie game format.\n\nThe success of \"Cave Story\" paved the way for a large number of retro-themed 2D platformers that have appeared since the mid-2000s, including the likes of \"Braid\" (2008), \"Super Meat Boy\" (2010), \"Fez\" (2012) and \"Mega Man 11\" (2018). Jonathan Holmes of \"Destructoid\" called \"Cave Story\" an \"important game\", observing its influence on artistic indie games like \"Braid\", as well as the continued relevance of 2D game design (cf. Capcom's \"Mega Man 9\"). \"Cave Story\" inspired a retro pixel art comeback, and helped turned indie games from an amateur hobby into big business, paving the way for the success of games such as \"Braid\", \"Minecraft\" (2011) and \"Hotline Miami\" (2012).\n\n"}

All 73 people on board the Douglas DC-8 aircraft were killed. Two time bombs were used, whose explosives have been variously described as dynamite or C-4. The crash killed every member of the Cuban National Fencing team.\n\nSeveral CIA-linked anti-Castro Cuban exiles were implicated by the evidence. Political complications quickly arose when Cuba accused the US government of being an accomplice to the attack. CIA documents released in 2005 indicate that the agency \"had concrete advance intelligence, as early as June 1976, on plans by Cuban exile terrorist groups to bomb a Cubana airliner.\" Former CIA terrorist operative Luis Posada Carriles denies involvement but provides many details of the incident in his book \"Caminos del Guerrero\" (Ways of the Warrior). The Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations, of which Carriles was a member, is widely seen as responsible for the bombing.\n\nFour men were arrested in connection with the bombing, and a trial was held in Venezuela. Freddy Lugo and Hernán Ricardo Lozano were each sentenced to 20-year prison terms. Orlando Bosch was acquitted and later moved to Miami, Florida, where he lived until his death on April 27, 2011. Luis Posada Carriles was held for eight years while awaiting a final sentence but eventually fled. He later entered the United States, where he was held on charges of entering the country illegally, but was released on April 19, 2007.\n\nOn June 11, 1976, Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations (CORU) was founded in the Dominican Republic. CORU united five anti-Castro Cuban exile groups, including Alpha 66 and Omega 7. For three months prior to the bombing of Flight 455, CORU waged a campaign of violence against several Caribbean countries which had established links with Cuba.\n\nIn July 1976, the same flight was targeted in Jamaica by a suitcase bomb which exploded shortly before being loaded onto the plane. Other bombings in the summer included a number of offices of airlines carrying out business with Cuba, including the offices of the BWIA West Indies Airways in Barbados; of Air Panama in Colombia; and of Iberia and Nanaco Line in Costa Rica.\n\nOther attacks included the murder of a Cuban official in Mexico and two more Cuban officials in Argentina; the September assassination of Orlando Letelier in Washington, D.C.; and \"a mysterious fire in Guyana [which] destroyed a large quantity of Cuban-supplied fishing equipment.\"\n\nOn October 5, 1976, Lugo and Hernán Ricardo Lozano left Caracas for Trinidad, arriving at 1 a.m. The following day, they sought to board Cubana de Aviación's Flight CU-455, which was scheduled to fly from Guyana to Havana, Cuba, via Trinidad, Barbados, and Kingston. They rejected the offer of an earlier flight with British West Indies Airways (BWIA). With a member of the Cuban fencing team waiting for the Cubana flight assisting with interpretation, the pair were able to insist on boarding the later Cubana flight. The pair left the flight at Barbados, and later returned to Trinidad.\n\nEleven minutes after takeoff from Barbadoss Seawell Airport (now Grantley Adams International Airport) and at an altitude of 18,000 feet, two bombs exploded on board. One was located in the aircraft's rear lavatory, and another in the midsection of the passenger cabin. The former ultimately destroyed the aircraft's control cables, while the latter blasted a hole in the aircraft and started a fire.\n\nThe plane went into a rapid descent, while the pilots tried unsuccessfully to return the plane to Seawell Airport. The captain, Wilfredo Pérez Pérez, radioed to the control tower: \"\"We have an explosion aboard – we are descending immediately! ... We have fire on board! We are requesting immediate landing! We have a total emergency!\"\" Realizing a successful landing was no longer possible, it appears that the pilot turned the craft away from the beach and towards the Caribbean Sea off porters St James, saving the lives of many tourists. The crash occurred about eight kilometres short of the airport.\n\nAll 48 passengers and 25 crew aboard the plane died: the passengers comprised 57 Cubans, 11 Guyanese, and 5 North Koreans. Among the dead were all 24 members of the 1975 national Cuban fencing team that had just won all the gold medals in the Central American and Caribbean Championships; many were teenagers. Several officials of the Cuban government were also aboard the plane: Manuel Permuy Hernández, director of the National Institute of Sports (INDER); Jorge de la Nuez Suárez, secretary for the shrimp fleet; Alfonso González, National Commissioner of firearm sports; and Domingo Chacón Coello, an agent from the Interior Ministry. The 11 Guyanese passengers included five travelling to Cuba to study medicine, and the young wife of a Guyanese diplomat. The five Koreans were government officials and a cameraman.\n\nHours after the explosions, Trinidad authorities arrested Freddy Lugo and Hernan Ricardo Lozano, two Venezuelan men who had boarded the plane in Trinidad and checked their baggage to Cuba, but who had exited the plane in Barbados and flown back to Trinidad. Lozano had been traveling with a false identity under the name of José Vázquez García.\n\nLugo and Lozano confessed, and declared they were acting under the orders of Luis Posada Carriles, a CIA operative. Their testimony, along with other evidence, implicated Posada and fellow CIA operative Orlando Bosch, an anti-Castro Cuban living in Venezuela.\n\nOn October 14, 1976, Posada and Bosch were arrested in Caracas, Venezuela, and the offices of \"Investigaciones Comerciales e Industriales C.A.\" (ICICA), a private investigator's company owned by Posada, were raided. Weapons, explosives and a radio transmitter were found. Lozano was an employee of ICICA at the time of the attack, while Lugo worked as a photographer for the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons.\n\nOn October 20, authorities of Trinidad, Cuba, Barbados, Guyana and Venezuela held a meeting in Port of Spain, during which it was decided to hold the trial in Caracas, Venezuela, since the four accused were citizens of that country. Shortly after, Lugo and Lozano were deported to Venezuela.\n\nOn August 25, 1977, Judge Delia Estava Moreno referred the case to a military tribunal, charging all four co-conspirators with treason.\n\nIn September 1980, a Venezuelan military judge acquitted all four men.\n\nThe prosecutor appealed, arguing that a military court was the wrong forum to try the case for two reasons: none of the men were military personnel in 1976, and the crime of qualified homicide or aggravated homicide cannot be tried by a military tribunal. The Military Court of Appeals agreed and surrendered jurisdiction, rendering the acquittal moot. The Judge ruled that the accused \"\"are civilians and the crimes imputed to them are governed by the penal (and not the military) code... Civilians and common law crimes are not subject to the dispositions of the Code of Military Justice...\"\"\n\nThe four were then charged with aggravated homicide and treason before a civilian court.\n\nOn August 8, 1985, Venezuelan judge Alberto Perez Marcano of the 11th Penal Court convicted Lugo and Ricardo, sentencing them each to 20 years in prison. The judge reduced the penalty to its lowest limit \"due to the extenuating circumstance of no prior criminal records.\" Orlando Bosch was acquitted, because the evidence gathered by the Barbados authorities during the investigation could not be used in the Venezuela trial, as it was presented too late and had not been translated into Spanish.\n\nPosada fled from the San Juan de los Morros penitentiary on the eve of the pronouncement of his sentence. He had been confined there following two previous failed escape attempts. Allegations were made that Venezuelan authorities were bribed to help him escape. No verdict was entered against Posada because, according to the Venezuelan Penal Code, judicial proceedings cannot continue without the presence of the accused. The court issued an arrest warrant against him which was still pending .\n\nA different judge then ordered the case reviewed by a higher court. The Venezuelan government declined to appeal the case any further, and in November 1987 Bosch was freed. He had spent 11 years in jail despite having been acquitted twice. Lugo and Lozano were released in 1993 and continue to reside in Venezuela.\n\nPosada then fled to Panama and to the United States. In April 2005, a new warrant for his arrest in connection with the bombing was issued in Venezuela by the government of Hugo Chávez. However, a U.S. immigration judge ruled that Posada should not be deported to Cuba or Venezuela because he could be subject to torture in those countries. In 2007, Congressman Bill Delahunt and Jose Pertierra, an immigration lawyer representing the government of Venezuela, argued that Posada could be deported on the grounds that the U.S. was making an exception for Posada. Because, they argued, the U.S. practices extraordinary rendition involving the seizure and transportation of suspected terrorists to Syria and Egypt, both of which practice torture, the U.S. could also deport Posada, a terrorist, to Cuba or Venezuela.\n\nFreed from Venezuelan charges, Bosch went to the United States, assisted by US Ambassador to Venezuela Otto Reich; there, he was ultimately arrested for a parole violation. On 18 July 1990, Bosch was pardoned of all American charges by President George H. W. Bush at the request of his son Jeb Bush, who later became Governor of Florida; this pardon was despite objections by the President's own defense department that Bosch was one of the most deadly terrorists working \"within the hemisphere.\" Although many countries sought Bosch's extradition, he remained free in the United States. The political pressure to grant Bosch a pardon was begun during the congressional campaign run by Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, herself a Cuban American, and overseen by her campaign manager Jeb Bush.\n\nIn 2005, Posada was held by U.S. authorities in Texas on the charge of illegal presence on national territory before the charges were dismissed on May 8, 2007. His release on bail on April 19, 2007, had elicited angry reactions from the Cuban and Venezuelan governments. The U.S. Justice Department had urged the court to keep him in jail because he was \"an admitted mastermind of terrorist plots and attacks\", a flight risk and a danger to the community.\n\nOn September 28, 2005, a U.S. immigration judge ruled that Posada could not be deported because he faced the threat of torture in Venezuela.\n\nLuis Posada Carriles, a Cuban-born naturalized Venezuelan, was the Director of Counterintelligence at Venezuela's FBI equivalent, the DISIP, from 1967 to 1974. A U.S. Government document released through FOIA also confirms Posada's status with the CIA: \"\"Luis Posada, in whom CIA has an operational interest - Posada is receiving approximately $300 per month from CIA\"\". Posada was heavily involved with right-wing anti-Castro groups, in particular the Cuban-American National Foundation (CANF) and the \"Coordinadora de Organizaciones Revolucionarias Unidas\" (Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations - CORU), led at the time by Orlando Bosch.\n\nAccording to documents, Posada stopped being a CIA asset in 1974, but there remained \"occasional contact\" until June 1976, a few months before the bombing. CIA had concrete advance intelligence, as early as June 1976, on possible plans by Cuban exile terrorist groups to bomb a Cubana airliner, and the FBI's attaché in Caracas had multiple contacts with one of the Venezuelans who placed the bomb on the plane, and provided him with a visa to the U.S. five days before the bombing, despite suspicions that he was engaged in terrorist activities at the direction of Luis Posada Carriles.\n\nA declassified CIA document dated October 12, 1976, a few days after the bombing, quotes Posada as saying, a few days after a plate fund-raising meeting for CORU held around September 15, \"We are going to hit a Cuban airliner... Orlando has the details\" (Source Comment: The identities of \"We\" and \"Orlando\" were not known at the time.)\n\nA declassified FBI document dated October 21, 1976, quotes CORU member Secundino Carrera as stating that CORU \"was responsible for the bombing of the Cubana Airlines DC-8 on October 6, 1976... this bombing and the resulting deaths were fully justified because CORU was at war with the Fidel Castro regime.\" Carrera also expressed his pleasure over the attention paid to the United States over the bombing, as it was taking attention off of himself and his associate.\n\nDocuments released by the National Security Archive on May 3, 2007, reveal the links Posada had to the 1976 Cubana airline bombing and other terrorist attacks and plots, including a British West Indian Airways office in Barbados and the Guyanese Embassy in Trinidad. \nThese provide additional proof of Posada's involvement in violent efforts to undermine Castro's socialist government, said Peter Kornbluh, director of the National Security Archive's Cuba Documentation Project. The Archive is an independent research organization located at George Washington University.\n\nA monument was erected at Payne's Bay, Saint James, Barbados, to the memory of the people killed in the bombing. It was visited several times by Fidel Castro and other Cuban and Venezuelan officials, including a visit during the CARICOM meeting in December 2005, during which Cuban officials called for Posada \"to be brought to justice so as to bring closure to this egregious incident that caused so much pain to the people of the region.\" In October 2012, an additional monument to the tragedy was unveiled on the Turkeyen campus of the University of Guyana.\n\n\n"}

After making his way through the ranks – including a successful 'work experience' loan at A.F.C. Newbury – he was loaned to Football League Two club Kidderminster Harriers, making his debut in a 2–0 defeat to Bristol Rovers. Keene was the Man of the Match for the visitors. He played five more games for Kidderminster, excelling during his loan period.\n\nHe was rewarded upon his return to Fratton Park with his first professional contract, to run until the summer of 2007.\n\nFollowing his loan he broke into the first team squad, and played in the final two games of the 2004–05 season, making his debut against Bolton Wanderers in a 1–1 draw as a 60th-minute substitute.

Three days later he scored twice in a 4-1 win over Aldershot Town in the Football League Trophy. His fourth and final goal for the club came in a 2-0 league victory against Brentford. He then joined League 2 side Boston United, where he scored his first and only goal for the club in a 1-1 draw with Rochdale.\n\nKeene was loaned in March 2006 to GAIS for the Swedish 2006 Allsvenskan. Keene scored the first goal of the season for GAIS in the Allsvenskan in the Gothenburg derby against Örgryte IS.

{"id": "1904554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904554", "title": "Allis-Chalmers", "text": "Allis-Chalmers\n\nAllis-Chalmers was a U.S. manufacturer of machinery for various industries. Its business lines included agricultural equipment, construction equipment, power generation and power transmission equipment, and machinery for use in industrial settings such as factories, flour mills, sawmills, textile mills, steel mills, refineries, mines, and ore mills. The first Allis-Chalmers Company was formed in 1901 as an amalgamation of the Edward P. Allis Company (steam engines and mill equipment), Fraser & Chalmers (mining and ore milling equipment), the Gates Iron Works (rock and cement milling equipment), and the industrial business line of the Dickson Manufacturing Company (engines and compressors). It was reorganized in 1912 as the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company. During the next 70 years its industrial machinery filled countless mills, mines, and factories around the world, and its brand gained fame among consumers mostly from its farm equipment business's orange tractors and silver combine harvesters. In the 1980s and 1990s, a series of divestitures transformed the firm and eventually dissolved it. Its successors today are Allis-Chalmers Energy and AGCO.\n\nAuthor-photographer Randy Leffingwell (1993) aptly summarized the firm's origins and character. He observed that it \"grew by acquiring and consolidating the innovations\" of various smaller firms and building upon them; and he continued that \"Metal work and machinery were the common background. Financial successes and failures brought them together.\"\n\nFormer marketing executive Walter M. Buescher (1991) said that Allis-Chalmers \"was a conglomerate before the word was coined.\" Whether or not it is literally true that Allis-Chalmers predated the sense of \"conglomerate\" meaning a widely diversified parent corporation, Buescher's point is valid: Allis-Chalmers, despite its common theme of machinery, was an amalgamation of disparate business lines, each with a unique marketplace, beginning in an era when consolidations within industries were fashionable but those \"across\" industries were not yet common. \n\nEdward P. Allis was an entrepreneur who in 1860 bought a bankrupt firm at a sheriff's auction, the Reliance Works of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which had been owned by James Decker and Charles Seville. Decker & Seville were millwrights who made equipment for flour milling. Under Allis's management, the firm was reinvigorated and \"began producing steam engines and other mill equipment just at the time that many sawmills and flour mills were converting to steam power.\" Although the financial panic of 1873 \"caught Edward Allis overextended\" and forced him into bankruptcy, \"his own reputation saved him and reorganization came quickly,\" forming the Edward P. Allis Company. Leffingwell said, \"He set out to hire known experts: George Hinkley, who perfected the band saw; William Gray, who revolutionized the flour-milling process through roller milling; and Edwin Reynolds, who ran the Corliss Steam Engine works.\" Allis died in 1889, but under his sons (Charles Allis and William Allis) and the other principals, the firm continued to prosper, and by 1900 it had grown to become one of America's largest steam engine builders.\n\nThomas Chalmers was a Scottish immigrant to America who came to the U.S. about 1842. By 1844 he was at Chicago, Illinois and had found work with P.W. Gates, whose foundry and blacksmithing shops produced plows, wagons, and flour-milling equipment. The Gates firm \"built the first steam-operated sawmill in the country at a time when Chicago was the leading producer of milled lumber in the country.\" In 1872, Thomas Chalmers founded the Fraser & Chalmers firm to manufacture mining machinery, boilers, and pumps. By 1880 steam engines were part of the product line and by 1890, the firm had become one of the world's largest manufacturers of mining equipment. Thomas Chalmers's son, William James Chalmers, was president of the company from circa 1890 to 1901. Meanwhile, the Gates Iron Works, with Chalmers family involvement, had become a manufacturer of crushers, pulverizers, and other rock and cement milling equipment.\n\nAnother Scottish immigrant family, the Dickson family, came to Canada and the U.S. in the 1830s. By 1852, they had organized a small machine shop and foundry (Dickson & Company) in Scranton, Pennsylvania. In 1856 Thomas Dickson became its president, and in 1862 the firm incorporated as the Dickson Manufacturing Company. By 1900 they were building boilers, steam engines, locomotives, internal combustion engines, blowers, and air compressors.\n\nBy 1901 the principals of the Edward P. Allis, Fraser & Chalmers, and Gates firms had decided to merge their companies. Edwin Reynolds believed Allis could control the industrial engine business. In May 1901 the Allis-Chalmers Company was formed. It acquired Dickson's industrial engine business. Dickson's locomotive business was rolled into the new locomotive consolidation, the American Locomotive Company (ALCO).\n\nThe managing director of the new company was Charles Allis, his brother William was chairman of the board, and William J. Chalmers was deputy managing director. Shortly after the merger was completed, a new factory was built in an area west of Milwaukee that was then known as North Greenfield. In 1902, with this new factory, the locale was renamed West Allis, Wisconsin.\nWith the combining of the constituent firms, Allis-Chalmers offered a wide array of pyrometallurgic equipment, such as blast furnaces and converters for roasting, smelting, and refining; ore milling equipment, various kinds of crushers and pulverizers, including stamp mills, roller mills, ball mills, conical mills, rod mills, and jigging mills; cyanidation mills and other concentration mills; hoisting engines; cars, including skip cars, slag cars, and general mine cars; briquetting plants; and the pumps, tanks, boilers, compressors, hydraulic accumulators, pipes, valves, sieves, and conveyors needed within these products. Like other firms that build capital equipment for industrial corporations, it also supplied consulting, erecting, and training services, such as helping a mining company to design a plant, to build its buildings and set up its machinery, and to teach the employees how to use and maintain it.\n\nIn 1903, Allis-Chalmers acquired the Bullock Electric Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, which added steam turbines to Allis-Chalmers's powerplant equipment business line.\n\nBy 1912, the Allis-Chalmers Company was in financial trouble, so it was reorganized. It was renamed the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company, and Otto Falk, a former Brigadier General of the Wisconsin National Guard, was appointed to turn it around. Falk pushed for new products and new or expanded markets. Falk saw great growth potential in the mechanization of agriculture, which at the time was blossoming all over America. Allis-Chalmers's first farm tractors, the 10-18, the Model 6-12, and the Model 15-30, were developed and marketed between 1914 and 1919, and the farm implement line was expanded.\n\nAs had also been true of the 1900–1920 period, the Roaring Twenties were a favorable time for consolidation and even conglomeration throughout the business world. It was also a time of strongly continuing mechanization on North American farms. At Allis-Chalmers, the 1920s brought yet more tractors, such as the 18-30, the 12-20, the 15-25, and the United tractor/Model U.\n\nFamed inventor and engineer Nikola Tesla spent the period 1919-1922 working in Milwaukee for Allis-Chalmers.\n\nIn 1926 Falk hired Harry Merritt, who would be a senior executive in Allis-Chalmers's tractor business for many years. Merritt had worked in the sales and marketing of various brands of farm and construction equipment, most recently Holt, when Falk hired him away. Buescher, who worked under Merritt, credited Merritt with turning around Allis-Chalmers's ailing farm equipment business and transforming it into the main profit center for the parent corporation. He said, \"Some say that General Falk pulled Harry Merritt into Milwaukee to liquidate the ailing tractor division. Others say that he was brought in to breathe new life into the moribund and unprofitable operation. Even if the first appraisal is correct, the second proved to be the way it turned out. […] After Merritt's arrival, the profit picture changed. The farm equipment business proved to be a financial lifesaver for the corporation. […] From next to nothing in 1927, Merritt saw the percentage of farm equipment business go to just short of sixty percent of corporate sales.\"\n\nAlso in 1926, Allis-Chalmers acquired Nordyke Marmon & Company of Indianapolis, Indiana, a maker of flour-milling equipment. In 1927, it acquired the Pittsburgh Transformer Company, a maker of electrical transformers.\n\nIn 1928, Allis-Chalmers acquired the Monarch Tractor Company of Springfield, Illinois, thus adding a line of crawler tractors. In 1929, it acquired the La Crosse Plow Works of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The La Crosse Plow Works had a good-quality plow and various desirable implements, which now expanded the Allis-Chalmers implement line. Also in 1929, Harry Merritt was in California when the bright orange California poppy blossoms inspired him to think about the use of bright colors in marketing. Brightly colored things that can be seen from far away had potential in farm equipment marketing. He soon changed the paint color of Allis-Chalmers's tractors to Persian Orange, the available paint color that he felt most closely resembled the California poppy's color. Thus began the tradition of orange Allis-Chalmers tractors. Various competitors would follow suit over the next decade, as International Harvester switched to all-red (1936), Minneapolis-Moline switched to Prairie Gold (late 1930s), and Case switched to Flambeau Red (late 1930s). John Deere already had a distinctive color scheme with its bright green and yellow.\n\nIn 1928, Henry Ford canceled U.S. production of the Fordson tractor. This disrupted the business of many firms: farm equipment dealers who sold Fordsons and aftermarket equipment builders whose attachments were designed to mount on Fordsons (for example, the Gleaner combines of the 1920s mounted on Fordsons, and many Fordson industrial tractors used aftermarket attachments). Many of these firms formed a conglomerate in 1928 called the United Tractor & Equipment corporation. United arranged a deal with Allis-Chalmers to build a tractor to substitute for the now-missing Fordson. Around 1930, the United conglomerate collapsed. The reasons that various authors have given have been disagreements between its investors, the onset of the Great Depression, and the fact that Ford Motor Company Ltd of England, which was continuing the Fordson line independently of the U.S. Ford company, began exporting new Fordsons to America. The United tractor became the Allis-Chalmers Model U.\n\nThe 1930s were a pivotal decade. Despite the Great Depression, Allis-Chalmers succeeded as demand for its machinery continued.\n\nIn 1931, it acquired Advance-Rumely of La Porte, Indiana, mostly because Merritt wanted the company's network of 24 branch houses and about 2,500 dealers, which would greatly increase Allis-Chalmers's marketing and sales power in the farm equipment business. Also in 1931, the corporation's electrical equipment business expanded via acquisition when Brown, Boveri & Cie, in a financial pinch because of the Depression, sold its U.S. electrical operations to Allis-Chalmers. After 1931 Allis-Chalmers was the licensee for U.S. sales of European products of Brown, Boveri & Cie.\n\nIn 1932, Allis-Chalmers collaborated with Firestone to introduce pneumatic rubber tires to tractors. The innovation quickly spread industry-wide, as (to many farmers' surprise) it improved tractive force and fuel economy in the range of 10% to 20%. Within only 5 years, pneumatic rubber tires had displaced cleated steel wheels across roughly half of all tractors sold industry-wide. Cleated steel remained optional equipment into the 1940s. Also in 1932, Allis-Chalmers acquired the Ryan Manufacturing Company, which added various grader models to its construction equipment line.\n\nIn 1933, Allis-Chalmers introduced its Model WC, its first-generation row-crop tractor, which would become its highest-selling tractor ever. In 1937, its lighter and more affordable second-generation row-crop, the Model B, arrived, and also became a top seller. Its All-Crop Harvester was the market leader in pull-type (tractor-drawn) combine harvesters.\n\nIn October 1937, Allis-Chalmers was one of fourteen major electrical manufacturing companies that went to court to change the way labor unions excluded contractors and products in the building trades through the union use of the \"Men and Means Clause\". The action of Allis-Chalmers and others eventually resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court decision of June 18, 1945, that ended certain union practices that violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.\n\nWorld War II caused Allis-Chalmers, like most other manufacturing companies, to become extremely busy. As happened with many firms, its civilian product lines experienced a period of being \"on hold\", with emphasis on parts and service to keep existing machines running, but its war materiel production was pushed to the maximum of productivity and output. In the late 1930s through mid-1940s, Allis-Chalmers made machinery for naval ships, such as Liberty ship steam engines, steam turbines, generators, and electric motors; artillery tractors and tractors for other army use; electrical switches and controls; and other products. Allis-Chalmers was also one of many firms contracted to build equipment for the Manhattan Project. Its experience in mining and milling machinery made it a logical choice for uranium mining and processing equipment. Allis-Chalmers ranked 45th among United States corporations in the value of wartime military production contracts.\n\nImmediately at the war's end, in 1945–1946, Allis-Chalmers endured a crippling 11-month labor strike. Buescher was convinced that the corporation never entirely recovered from the effects of this strike. This seems debatable given the various successes that Allis-Chalmers did have during the next 30 years, including prosperity in the farm equipment business in the 1950s and 1960s. But it certainly gave competitors a chance to grab market share.\n\nAfter WWII some companies refused to sell equipment to Japanese farmers. Allis-Chalmers dealers did not hesitate to sell to these farmers so many farms to this day still have an Allis-Chalmers tractor in Oregon. \n\nIn 1948, the Model WC was improved with various new features and became the Model WD, another top seller. The WD was a milestone for the company. It included fully independent power take off, which was powered by a two clutch system. It also included power adjust rear wheels, which became an industry standard. Production of this model continued into 1953, with nearly 150,000 tractors produced.\n\nThe 1950s were a time of great demand for more power in farm tractors, as well as greater capability from their hydraulic and electrical systems. It was also a decade of extensive dieselization, from railroad locomotives to farm tractors and construction equipment. In 1953, Allis-Chalmers acquired the Buda Engine Company of Harvey, Illinois. Allis wanted Buda for its line of diesel engines, because its previous supplier, Detroit Diesel, was a division of General Motors, whose recent acquisition of the Euclid heavy equipment company now made it a competitor of Allis-Chalmers for construction equipment business. The Buda-Lanova models were re-christened the \"Allis-Chalmers Diesel\" engine line. Diesel engineers were busy during the following years updating and expanding the line.\n\nIn 1952, the company acquired Laplant-Choate, which added various models of scrapers to its construction equipment line.\n\nIn 1953, the WD-45 was introduced, replacing the WD. The motor was increased to 226 cubic inches, giving it 30 horsepower on the drawbar at the Nebraska Tests http://www.ritchiewiki.com/wiki/index.php/University_of_Nebraska_Tractor_Test. This was almost double the horsepower of the WD. A new Allis chalmers designed Snap- Coupler hitch was used. It allowed the operator to hook up to an implement from the seat of the tractor. A Buda diesel-powered WD-45 was introduced in 1955. This series stayed in production until the unveiling of the D-series in 1957.\n\nIn 1955, the company acquired Gleaner Manufacturing Company, which was an important move for its combine harvester business. Allis was the market leader in pull-type (tractor-drawn) combines, with its All-Crop Harvester line. But acquiring Gleaner meant that it would now also be a leader in self-propelled machines, and it would own two of the leading brands in combines. The Gleaner line augmented (and later superseded) the All-Crop Harvester line, and for several years Gleaner's profits made up nearly all of Allis-Chalmers' profit. Gleaners continued to be manufactured at the same factory, in Independence, Missouri, after the acquisition.\n\nIn 1957, the Allis-Chalmers D Series of tractors was introduced. It enjoyed great success over the next decade.\n\nIn 1959, Allis-Chalmers acquired the French company Vendeuvre. Also in 1959, it acquired Tractomotive Corporation of Deerfield, Illinois, which it had been partnering with as an auxiliary equipment supplier for at least a decade.\n\nIn Haycraft's history of the construction equipment business (2000), he expressed the view that Allis-Chalmers relied too heavily for too long on partnering with auxiliary equipment suppliers, and acquiring them, instead of investing in in-house product development. In his view, this strategy limited the company's success in this business, and it eventually had to spend the development dollars anyway. Buescher's comments about the Buda acquisition and the need for subsequent improvement of its designs seem to corroborate this view. However, the topic is multivariate and complex; elsewhere in his memoir, Buescher presents a viewpoint in which investing in research and product development is an expensive move that often does not pay off for the innovator and mostly benefits competitor clones.\n\nIn 1960, the U.S. government uncovered an attempt to form a cartel in the heavy electric equipment industry. It charged 13 companies, including the largest in the industry (Westinghouse, General Electric, and Allis-Chalmers), with price fixing and bid rigging. Most feigned innocence, but Allis-Chalmers pleaded guilty. Although one motive for the forming of cartels is so that amply profitable firms can try to become obscenely profitable, it did not apply in this instance, according to Buescher; rather, his view of the attempt at a heavy-electrical cartel was that it was a desperate (and foolish) attempt to turn red ink to black ink among fierce competition.\n\nThe D series continued to be successful in the 1960s. The factory-installed turbocharger on the D19 was the first in the industry. It was soon followed by the 190 and the 190 XT, which was a direct competitor for the John Deere Model 4020 with 98 horsepower (factory rating).\n\nIn 1965, Allis-Chalmers acquired Simplicity for its line of lawn and garden equipment. Also in that year, the nuclear reactor SAFARI-1, a research reactor built by Allis-Chalmers, went into operation.\n\nIn the 1960s, the farm equipment, construction equipment, and heavy electrical industries were not as profitable for Allis-Chalmers as they had been in the 1930s through 1950s. Reasonable prosperity continued in the farm equipment line, but the economics of all the industries shifted toward greater uncertainty and brittler success for firms that didn't become number one or two in a field. Allis-Chalmers was often number three or four, as Deere and International Harvester led in farm machinery, Caterpillar and Case led in construction, and Westinghouse and General Electric led in heavy electric markets. In the late 1960s, a trend of conglomeration flared, as mega-conglomerates like Ling-Temco-Vought, Gulf+Western, and White Consolidated Industries went on buying sprees. Several takeover attempts by those firms were made on Allis-Chalmers. It was during the same era and business climate that Tenneco acquired Case.\n\nIn 1960, Allis-Chalmers built the first grate-kiln ore pellet plant at the Humboldt mine in Michigan. The company eventually built about 50 such plants.\n\nIn 1974, Allis-Chalmers's construction equipment business was reorganized into a joint venture with Fiat SpA, which bought a 65% majority stake at the outset. The new company was called Fiat-Allis.\n\nIn May 1975, the company closed its 20-acre, 78-year-old Pittsburgh North Side factory that employed close to 1,100 full-time and produced both distribution and instrument control transformers.\n\nIn 1977, to compete in the recently expanding market segment of compact diesel utility tractors (such as the Kubota line and the Ford 1000 and 1600 built by Shibaura), Allis-Chalmers began importing Hinomoto tractors with Toyosha diesel engines from Japan. They were rebadged with the Allis-Chalmers brand for U.S. sales.\n\nIn 1978, a joint venture with Siemens, Siemens-Allis, was formed, supplying electrical control equipment.\n\nThe company began to struggle in the 1980s in a climate of rapid economic change. It was forced amid financial struggles to sell major business lines.\n\nIn 1983, Allis-Chalmers sold Simplicity, the lawn and garden equipment division, to the division's management.\n\n1985 was a year of great dissolution for Allis-Chalmers—the year when it folded three of its main business lines: \n\nIn 1988, Allis-Chalmers sold its American Air Filter filtration business (with 27 production facilities internationally and sales into 100-plus countries) for approximately $225 million to SnyderGeneral Corporation of Dallas, a leading global air quality control firm.\n\nIn 1990, Deutz-Allis was sold to its management and became Allis-Gleaner Corporation (AGCO). Tractors began selling under the AGCO-Allis name and were again painted Persian Orange. The AGCO brand of orange tractors was produced until 2010 when AGCO announced that it was phasing out the brand.\n\nIn 1998, what remained of the Allis-Chalmers manufacturing businesses were divested, and in January 1999, the company officially closed its Milwaukee offices. The remaining service businesses became Allis-Chalmers Energy in Houston, Texas.\n\nIn August 2008, Briggs & Stratton announced that it would sell lawn tractors under the Allis-Chalmers brand name.\n\n\nAllis-Chalmers offered a complete line of agricultural machinery, from tillage and harvesting to tractors.\n\nIn 1959, a team led by Harry Ihrig built a 15 kW fuel cell tractor for Allis-Chalmers which was demonstrated across the US at state fairs. This was the first fuel-cell-powered vehicle. Potassium hydroxide served as the electrolyte. The original AC fuel cell tractor is currently on display at the Smithsonian.\n\nThe first model introduced in 1949 was called the \"Roto-Baler\" and the fore-runner of modern round balers, albeit with much smaller bales. The Roto-Baler was built until the 1960s or 1970s. Allis Chalmers also built many small square baler models.\n\nWhile AGCO is now the parts manufacturer for most of the parts one would need to fix up their older Allis-Chalmers tractors, including water pumps to oil filters, and even rebuild kits and tractor manuals, aftermarket suppliers offer parts that AGCO does not.\n\nAllis Chalmers marketed a full line of Industrial and Power House equipment, including turbo generators and medium voltage switchgear. In the 1920s through the 1960s AC Power House and Industrial equipment was competitive with industry giants like General Electric and Westinghouse. As early as the 1920s AC was manufacturing multi MVA hydro-electric generators and turbines, many of which remain in service today (Louisville Gas & Electric Ohio Falls units 1–8, 8MW low head turbines and Kentucky Utilities Dix Dam units 1–3, 11MVA 300 RPM generators).\n\nAllis Chalmers manufactured several lines of medium voltage switchgear, such as the HF and MA lines. The HF line competed with the General Electric \"AM\" Magneblast line of vertical-lift medium-voltage switchgear. The MA line was a competitor of the ITE \"HK\" line of horizontal-racking medium-voltage switchgear.\n\nAllis-Chalmers produced a line of substation transformers, voltage regulators, and distribution transformers.\n\nAllis Chalmers, during the period 1930–1965 and beyond, manufactured and marketed an extensive line of ore crushing equipment for the mining industry\n\nIn 1965, Allis-Chalmers built \"Big Allis,\" or Ravenswood No. 3, the biggest generator in New York. It is located in Queens, and has an output of 1000 MW. It is operational today.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s AC expanded into lawn and out-door equipment.\n\nAC made a line of 6-wheeled Amphibious ATV's called the \"Terra Tiger\".\n\nIn 1965, Allis-Chalmers built hydrogen fueled fuel cell golf carts.\n\n\nAllis-Chalmers Energy is a Houston-based multi-faceted oilfield services company. Allis-Chalmers provides services and equipment to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, both domestically and internationally.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He made his first-team debut at the age of 18, in a goalless draw with Sheffield United in December 2000. However, he struggled to break into the side on a regular basis and was loaned out to Division Two side Brentford for the 2002–03 season.\n\nVine enjoyed a successful campaign at Griffin Park, netting his first ever goal on his debut in a 2–0 win at Huddersfield Town, and going on to score 13 further goals in 44 starts for the Bees. Despite his impressive season, he was again loaned out, this time to Colchester United for the 2003–04 campaign; he scored 10 league goals in 30 starts.\n\nFor the third year running, Vine spent an entire season away from Portsmouth on loan, this time at Luton Town for the 2004–05 season. Vine's nine goals helped the Hatters clinch the League One title. Despite this relative lack of goals for a striker during a season, a section in the \"Luton News\" newspaper showed that Vine was the \"King of Assists\" – one of the main reasons for the Hatters' success.\n\nVine signed for Luton for an undisclosed fee, reported as £250,000, on 4 July 2005. In his first season after his permanent move to the club, he scored 10 goals in 30 games after missing the start of the season with a back injury. Again, he was near the top of the assist charts.\n\nA £2.5 million deal took Vine to Football League Championship club Birmingham City on 11 January 2007; the fee was to rise to £3m if Birmingham gained promotion to the Premier League. Vine's only goal in his short stay at Birmingham came in a 1–0 win over Derby County in March 2007, but he played 17 times as the club were promoted as runners-up.\n\nOn 2 October 2007, he joined Queens Park Rangers on loan, initially for a month, but later extended into the new year. Vine signed a four-and-a-half-year contract with the club on 8 January 2008 for a fee of £1 million.\n\nVine suffered a serious fracture of his left tibia and fibula on 3 April 2008 during a training session. He did not make another first-team appearance until April 2009, and thereafter was used mainly as a substitute. Manager Neil Warnock told him in July 2010 that he had no future with the club, and was not given a squad number for the new season. He joined Hull City on a month's loan on 1 October, and made his debut the following day at the KC Stadium in a goalless draw with Coventry City.\n\nOn 25 November 2010 he started a loan period at Brentford until 4 January 2011, but never played. He joined Milton Keynes Dons on an initial one-month loan on 15 January, and scored his only goal for the club in a 4–1 win at Rochdale.\n\nA trial with Doncaster Rovers in July 2011 came to nothing, and at the start of the 2011–12 season, Vine spent time on loan at Exeter City. In March 2012, he had a trial with Southend United, but manager Paul Sturrock expressed concerns over his fitness. He then signed for Gillingham on loan until the end of the season. He scored his only goal for Gillingham in a 2–1 defeat to Dagenham & Redbridge.\n\nQueens Park Rangers released Vine at the end of the 2011–12 season, and after a trial, he signed a one-year contract with Scottish Premier League club St Johnstone. He made his debut in the opening game of the season, and was sent off for a second bookable offence in the next, a 1–1 draw with Motherwell. Citing the poor example he set to his young son, he vowed to pull out of tackles in future rather than risk another sending-off. When scoring for St Johnstone, Vine celebrated by making a 'T' gesture.\n\nOn 15 September, Vine scored his first goal for the club, a curling effort ten minutes from time against reigning SPL champions Celtic that gave St Johnstone their first win of the season. After the match, he described the goal as \"right up there\" in his career highlights. He finished the season as joint top scorer in the league, with seven goals, but was not offered a contract extension. New manager Tommy Wright suggested it was down to budgetary constraints, but Vine was critical of the manner in which the club had handled his departure, accusing them of a lack of respect.\n\nVine moved on to Hibernian on a one-year deal, joining up with St Johnstone teammate Liam Craig. After a match against Celtic in October, opposing manager Neil Lennon was critical of Vine's tackling. Vine's retaliation on social media brought him a charge of \"making offensive comments on Twitter suggesting the use of violence\", but the Scottish Football Association let him off with a warning. After failing to score in 14 appearances, he was told by manager Terry Butcher that he would \"struggle to break into the Hibs team\", and in January 2014, his contract with Hibernian was cancelled by mutual consent.\n\nAs the January 2014 transfer window closed, Vine signed for Greenock Morton. He left Morton in the summer of 2014 after the club were relegated.\n\nVine returned to England where he signed for Conference Premier club Welling United in January 2015. He played only twice, and after a brief spell with Havant & Waterlooville, he joined National League South club Gosport Borough in October 2015. After a brief period with Basingstoke Town between 2015 and 2016, he rejoined Gosport in January 2017.\n\nIn February 2017, having made only three appearances since his return to Gosport, Vine joined Southall of the Spartan South Midlands League. At the beginning of the 2017–18 season, he moved to Hayes & Yeading United. Following a four-month spell with Hartley Wintney, Vine rejoined Gosport in March 2018.\n\nLuton Town\n\nBirmingham City\n\nIndividual\n"}

It is an electronic resource that comprises molecular and biochemical information on enzymes that have been classified by the IUBMB. Every classified enzyme is characterized with respect to its catalyzed biochemical reaction. Kinetic properties of the corresponding reactants (that is, substrates and products) are described in detail. BRENDA contains enzyme-specific data manually extracted from primary scientific literature and additional data derived from automatic information retrieval methods such as text mining. It provides a web-based user interface that allows a convenient and sophisticated access to the data. \n\nBRENDA was founded in 1987 at the former German Research Centre for Biotechnology (now the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research) in Braunschweig and was originally published as a series of books. Its name was originally an acronym for the Braunschweig Enzyme Database. From 1996 to 2007, BRENDA was located at the University of Cologne. There, BRENDA developed into a publicly accessible enzyme information system. In 2007, BRENDA returned to Braunschweig. Currently, BRENDA is maintained and further developed at the Department of Bioinformatics and Biochemistry at the TU Braunschweig.\n\nA major update of the data in BRENDA is performed twice a year. Besides the upgrade of its content, improvements of the user interface are also incorporated into the BRENDA database.\n\nDatabase:\n\nThe database contains more than 40 data fields with enzyme-specific information on more than 7000 EC numbers that are classified according to the IUBMB.\nThe different data fields cover information on the enzyme's nomenclature, reaction and specificity, enzyme structure, isolation and preparation, enzyme stability, kinetic parameters such as Km value and turnover number, occurrence and localization, mutants and engineered enzymes, application of enzymes and ligand-related data. Currently, BRENDA contains manually annotated data from over 140,000 different scientific articles. Each enzyme entry is clearly linked to at least one literature reference, to its source organism, and, where available, to the protein sequence of the enzyme. An important part of BRENDA represent the more than 110,000 enzyme ligands, which are available on their names, synonyms or via the chemical structure. The term \"ligand\" is used in this context to all low molecular weight compounds which interact with enzymes. These include not only metabolites of primary metabolism, co-substrates or cofactors but also enzyme inhibitors or metal ions. The origin of these molecules ranges from naturally occurring antibiotics to synthetic compounds that have been synthesized for the development of drugs or pesticides.\nFurthermore, cross-references to external information resources such as sequence and 3D-structure databases, as well as biomedical ontologies, are provided.\n\nExtensions:\n\nSince 2006, the data in BRENDA is supplemented with information extracted from the scientific literature by a co-occurrence based text mining approach. For this purpose, four text-mining repositories FRENDA (Full Reference ENzyme DAta), AMENDA (Automatic Mining of ENzyme DAta), DRENDA (Disease-Related ENzyme information DAtabase) and KENDA (Kinetic ENzyme DAta) were introduced. These text-mining results were derived from the titles and abstracts of all articles in the literature database PubMed.\n\nData access:\n\nThere are several tools to obtain access to the data in BRENDA. Some of them are listed here.\n\n\nThe usage of BRENDA is free of charge. In addition, FRENDA and AMENDA are free for non-profit users. Commercial users are in need of a license for these databases through BIOBASE.\n\nBRENDA provides links to several other databases with a different focus on the enzyme, e.g., metabolic function or enzyme structure. Other links lead to ontological information on the corresponding gene of the enzyme in question. Links to the literature are established with PubMed.\nBRENDA links to some further databases and repositories such as:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1904574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904574", "title": "André Jolivet", "text": "André Jolivet\n\nAndré Jolivet (, 8 August 1905 – 20 December 1974) was a French composer. Known for his devotion to French culture and musical thought, Jolivet drew on his interest in acoustics and atonality, as well as both ancient and modern musical influences, particularly on instruments used in ancient times. He composed in a wide variety of forms for many different types of ensembles.\n\nAndré Jolivet was born on 8 August 1905, at rue Versigny in Montmartre, Paris, the son of Victor-Ernest Jolivet and Madeleine Perault; his father an artist, his mother a pianist. Jolivet developed an interest in the arts early in his life, taking up painting and cello lessons at the age of 14. However, he was encouraged by his parents to become a teacher, going to teachers' college and teaching primary school in Paris (taking three years in between to serve in the military). One of his own teachers, however, believed Jolivet had a future in music, strongly encouraged him to pursue composition, and introduced him to Paul Le Flem, Jolivet's first teacher in composition. Le Flem gave Jolivet a firm grounding in classical forms of harmony and counterpoint. After hearing his first concert of Arnold Schoenberg, Jolivet became interested in atonal music, and then on Le Flem's recommendation became the only European student of Edgard Varèse, who passed on his knowledge of musical acoustics, atonal music, sound masses, and orchestration. In 1936 Jolivet co-founded the group \"La jeune France\" along with composers Olivier Messiaen, Daniel-Lesur, and Yves Baudrier, who were attempting to re-establish a more human and less abstract form of composition. La jeune France developed from the avant-garde chamber music society \"La Spirale\", formed by Jolivet, Messiaen, and Lesur the previous year.\n\nJolivet married twice, firstly violinist Martine Barbillion in 1929; they had a daughter, Francoise-Martine (1930–2004). In 1933, he married Hilda Ghuighui (also spelt Guigue) (1906–1996), and they had three children, Pierre-Alain (1935–2005), Christine (b. 1940), and Merri (b. 1943).\n\nJolivet died in Paris in 1974 aged 69, leaving unfinished his opera \"Le Soldat inconnu\". He was buried at Montmartre Cemetery next to the composer Henri Sauguet (Section 27, near the grave of Hector Berlioz).\n\nJolivet's aesthetic ideals underwent many changes throughout his career. His initial desire as an adolescent was to write music for the theater, which inspired his first compositions, including music for a ballet. Claude Debussy, Paul Dukas, and Maurice Ravel were to be his next influences after he heard a concert of their work in 1919; he composed several piano pieces while training to become a teacher before going to study with Le Flem. Schoenberg and Varèse were strongly evident in his first period of maturity as a composer, during which his style drew heavily upon atonality and modernistic ideas. \"Mana\" (1933), the beginning of his \"magic period\", was a work in six parts for piano, with each part named after one of the six objects Varèse left with him before moving to the United States. Jolivet's intent as a composer throughout his career was to \"give back to music its original, ancient meaning, when it was the magical, incantatory expression of the religious beliefs of human groups.\" \"Mana\", even as one of his first mature works, is a reflection of this; Jolivet considered the sculptures as fetish objects. His further writing continues to seek the original meanings of music and its capacity for emotional, ritual, and celebratory expression.\n\nIn 1945 he published a paper declaring that \"true French music owes nothing to Stravinsky\", though both composers drew heavily upon themes of ancient music in their work; Jolivet and \"La jeune France\" rejected neoclassicism in favor of a less mechanical and progressive and instead a more spiritual style of composition. Later, during World War II, Jolivet shifted away from atonality and toward a more tonal and lyrical style of composition. After a few years of working in this more simplistic style, during which time he wrote the comic opera \"Dolorès, ou Le miracle de la femme laide\" (1942) and the ballet \"Guignol et Pandore\" (1943), he arrived at a compromise between this and his earlier more experimental work. The First Piano Sonata, written in 1945, shows elements of both these styles.\n\nFinally realizing his youthful ambition to write for the theater, Jolivet became the musical director of the Comédie Française in 1945, a post he held until 1959. While there he composed for plays by Molière, Racine, Sophocles, Shakespeare, and Claudel, scoring 14 works in total. He also continued to compose for the concert hall, often inspired by his frequent travels around the world, adapting texts and music from Egypt, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia into his distinctly French style.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Jolivet wrote several concertos for a variety of instruments including trumpet, piano, flute, harp, bassoon, percussion, cello, and violin. These works, while highly regarded, all demand virtuosic technical skill from the performers. Jolivet is also one of the few composers to write for the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument, completing a concerto for it in 1947, 19 years after the instrument's invention. Jolivet founded the \"Centre Français d'Humanisme Musical\" at Aix-en-Provence in 1959, and in 1961 went to teach composition at the Paris Conservatoire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was constructed in the early 21st century on the site of what had once been HM Gunwharf, Portsmouth. This was one of several such facilities which were established around Britain and the Empire by the Board of Ordnance, where cannons, ammunition and other armaments were stored, repaired and serviced ready for use on land or at sea. Later known as HMS \"Vernon\", the military site closed in 1995, and opened to the public as Gunwharf Quays after six years of reconstruction (which included the restoration of some of the surviving 18th and 19th-century Gun Wharf buildings). The landmark Spinnaker Tower, which also stands on the site, was opened a few years later.\n\nAn Ordnance Yard (the Old Gun Wharf) was established on land reclaimed from the sea to the north of the old Mill Pond (which survives today as the canal) in 1706. The site was extended by reclaiming further land from the sea to the south of the old Mill Pond to create the New Gun Wharf in circa 1800. The Grand Storehouse (built as part the New Gun Wharf and now known as the Vulcan Building) was completed in 1814.\n\nA wide range of ordnance-related equipment had to be accommodated within the Yard. Gun carriages in particular took up a lot of space, and were prone to decay if left outside. Cannons and cannonballs, on the other hand, could be stored in the open air without too much damage being done, as described here in 1817:\nEvery ship in ordinary has on the wharf her guns, placed in regular rows, each ship's guns by themselves, with the name of the ship they belong to, painted in capital letters on the first gun of each parcel. The balls are formed in pyramids from 42 pounders to the lowest bores, every size in a pyramid by themselves; the bomb shells are also placed in the same regular order.\n\nIn 1824 a set of storehouses along the southern edge of the site were converted to form barracks for the Royal Marine Artillery (the first time that this section of the Corps had been provided with its own separate barracks). In 1858 the Royal Marine Artillery moved out (first to Fort Cumberland, then to the new purpose-built Eastney Barracks).\n\nThe Grand Storehouse was mirrored by a similarly sizeable \"Sea Service Store\" on the Old Gun Wharf (later remodelled to serve as the \"Warrior\" naval accommodation block). In addition to these two, a plan dated 1859 indicates more than a dozen other large storehouses all around the site.\n\nAs ships and armaments developed, the requirement to offload the armament diminished, and the Gunwharf fell into disuse. It re-established as the Royal Navy shore establishment HMS \"Vernon\" in 1923. The site became HMS \"Nelson\" in 1986 and ceased operations in 1995.\n\nThe site was then sold to Berkeley Group Holdings in 1996 and, after being redeveloped to a design by HGP Architects, re-opened as a retail outlet in February 2001.\n\nHMS \"Vernon\" suffered extensive damage during the Blitz, but a number of historic structures survived, some of which have been restored as part of the Gunwharf Quays development. \n\n\n"}

Prior to becoming the VCU head coach, he was an assistant coach at the University of Florida from 1996 to 2006.\n\nAfter graduating from Miami Senior High School, Grant became an All-City first-team selection and Player-of-the-Year. He played at the University of Dayton from 1983 to 1987 while residing at 3 Evanston (The Gateway) and guiding them to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament before bowing out to eventual national champion Georgetown. As a sophomore, Grant averaged 10.7 points a game and 6.5 rebounds a game and the Flyers again made it to the NCAA Tournament. As a junior, the 6'5\" Grant moved from power forward to small forward and averaged 7.1 points a game and 4.8 rebounds a contest while the team advanced to the National Invitation Tournament. As a senior, Grant was named a team captain, was awarded team MVP, and won the Sharpenter Memorial Rebounding Award after leading the squad in scoring and rebounding, averaging 13.0 and 6.0 respectively. In his 105 appearances, Grant averaged 11.6 points and 6.7 rebounds. In 1987, Grant spent a year playing for the Miami Tropics of the United States Basketball League.\n\nIn 1987, Grant became an assistant coach and math teacher at Miami Senior High School under Marcos \"Shaky\" Rodriguez.\n\nThe Miami native served for ten years as an assistant to Billy Donovan at the University of Florida (UF). The 1999 and 2000 teams made the first back-to-back Sweet 16 appearances in school history and the 2000 squad made UF's first appearance in the National Championship game, where they lost to Michigan State.

{"id": "1904586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904586", "title": "The Apprentice (British TV series)", "text": "The Apprentice (British TV series)\n\nThe Apprentice is a British business-styled reality game show created by Mark Burnett, distributed by Fremantle and broadcast by the BBC since 16 February 2005. Devised after the success of the American original and part of the international franchise of the same name, the programme focuses on a group of businesspeople competing in a series of business-related challenges set by British business magnate Alan Sugar, in order to prove themselves worthy of a prize offered by him. To observe candidates as they undertake these tasks, Sugar is assisted by two close business associates who act as observers with little involvement in what is conducted - at present, these role are currently handled by Karren Brady and Claude Littner.\n\nOriginally aired on BBC Two, its first series generated favorable viewing figures that led to the creation of a companion discussion show entitled \"\", with further increasing figures after the second series leading to the programme being aired on BBC One to a much wider audience. The success of \"The Apprentice\" has led to it receiving its own merchandising, including a magazine and official books, along with one-off celebrity episodes for charity, and a spin-off, junior version entitled \"Young Apprentice\".\n\nThe programme is a staple part of the BBC's television schedule, with the programme contributing a significant part to television culture, including parodies and imitations for comedy, as well as influencing the designs of other British-based business programmes, such as \"Tycoon\", and \"Beat the Boss\".\n\nIn March 2004, following the success of NBC's \"The Apprentice\" that had drawn in favorable viewing figures after its first season, FremantleMedia saw the possibility for creating an international franchise, and announced its intentions to create a British version of the programme under the same format. Using the same name, the company offered any British broadcaster the chance to secure the rights to the new programme, of which the more significant bids came from two buyers the BBC and Channel 4. Negotiations came to their conclusion a month later on 1 April, when the BBC was announced as the new owners of the future programme following a successful bid that offered more than their rival, leaving the broadcaster with the task of finding a business personality to front \"The Apprentice\". Offers were made to several business individuals, promising a potentially lucrative opportunity, but each of their initial choices declined when approached - amongst those included Philip Green, Felix Dennis, and Michael O'Leary. Eventually over a month after their purchase, the BBC's offer was accepted by Alan Sugar, who agreed to presenting the twelve episodes that had been commissioned of the programme, with the news announced on 19 May. After the British version proved a success as its American original, Sugar opted to return, and signed on for subsequent series as a direct result.\n\nThe show's initial stage, which is not filmed, focuses on open auditions and interviews held across the country; this stage searches for the candidates for a series before filming of it begins, which often attracts thousands of applicants. A second round will usually be held in London for a small percentage of applicants, who divide into groups and are asked to do various exercises to test their business skills and to gauge how they work as a team. Following this, between 20 and 30 applicants are chosen and given an assessment by a psychologist, receiving further checks by the production team and providing them with references, before the final line-up is selected from this group and filming can begin. The number of candidates who appear in a series has varied over the show's history, though the general arrangement is that each series always consists of a balanced number of men and women when it begins.\n\nOnce the candidates are selected, they are divided into teams and given a series of business-themed tasks – every series focuses on ten team-oriented tasks, with the exception of the seventh and eighth series where it was eleven. Each episode covers a single task, which is designed to test candidates on important business skills – salesmanship, negotiation, requisitioning, strategy, leadership, teamwork, and organisation. Before each task is given, the teams are briefed by Sugar over what kind of challenge they will be conducting, what rules they must adhere to during the timespan of the task, and the conditions for winning - an example of this could be that they must buy supplies on a limited budget, convert them into a product, and then sell their creation all within a single day, with the win determined on who makes the highest profit from their concept. Before a task begins, each team must assign a project manager (PM) to lead them, whose roles involves denoting each member's role on the task, tackle the important key decisions, and manage team members carefully to avoid potential friction and disruptions. The role of PM is mainly chosen by the team - the choice, decided on a vote, can be influenced by factors, the most common being a candidate's business background and its relation to the task, or the amount of confidence team members have in their selection - but at times, Sugar may appoint someone into the role, based upon his opinion of their performance in the process, their background, or, since the seventh series, their business plan. The briefing period of the episode is often used at specific points in the series to rearrange teams, as candidates are whittled down in the process, and is mainly done to either balance out the number, ensure a fair distribution of skills for a specific task, or to give less vocal candidates a chance to demonstrate their abilities.\n\nEach team is provided with two vehicles to use to get around during a task, and can only split into two sub-teams for each task; in some tasks, the candidates are given additional items to use to assist them, such as a shop space or a workshop. Although the teams are expected to work together, the competitive nature of the show means that candidates will often focus on their individual roles and needs rather than the greater good of the team, primarily to prove themselves worthy of winning the process and increasing their chances of making it into the Final of the series. During the execution of their task, each team is followed by one of Sugar's aides, who notes down their opinions, observations and thoughts for later reference in the boardroom, mostly on any noteworthy matters, such as performance, mistakes, and issues, minor or serious; while it is rare for them to intervene, they may do so if an issue arises in the team's actions that needs their attention.\n\nOnce a task is finished, the candidates report back to Sugar at the \"boardroom\" – either following the task's completion, or the day after it has ended – to hear about feedback on their performance and learn the results of their endeavors. During team-based tasks, the process is played out in three stages in the following order - Results, Task Review, and Final Boardroom. Each stage is conducted in a different fashion, but follows a general format:\n\n\nWhile the boardroom scenes differ for the Interviews and Final (see sections below), there are a number of exceptions in regards to the boardroom format after tasks, which can occur during this scene:\n\nThe Interviews stage of the process takes place as the penultimate step of the competition, in which the five remaining candidates in the competition each undergoes an individual set of interviews with a selection of trusted aides of Sugar; for the seventh and eighth series, this stage was assigned as the final step, and featured the four remaining candidate in each respective series' competition.\n\nIn this stage, each interviewer questions the candidates over various matters, from their performance in the process, why they applied for the show, the content of their CVs, and their personal attitude with others, and often probe and scrutinize any brash, boastful, or controversial statements that they have made, including on their application forms and CVs, which can usually see them encouraged to prove such outlandish claims are truthful or were made up. The aim being to determine the suitability of the candidate for the prize being offered by Sugar. Since the seventh series, following the change of prize, the interviewers now scrutinise a candidate on their business plan, determining how feasible it is, if the candidate can achieve the plan, as well as rooting out any potential flaws and issues that come with it.\n\nAfter candidates have been through their interviews, and Sugar has heard feedback from the interviewers, he conducts a boardroom session to discuss with the candidates over what he has learnt about them, as well as reviewing their performance on the tasks they undertook. Eventually after discussions, he will determine who he feels has potential to move on to the Final, with his decision usually resulting in three candidates being fired at this stage of the competition; there has only been one instance in the show's history where Sugar fired just one candidate, as the feedback from the interviewers during the third series' competition made it difficult to fire more than one. For Series 7 and 8, where the Interviews was the final task, his decision determined who won the competition.\n\nKey:\n\nThe final stage of the competition sees the finalists of the process compete against each other in one final task, with the outcome influencing Sugar's decision on who wins the current series' competition, though his choice is determined through a comparison of the two candidates, and is not influenced purely on how successful a candidate is in the final stage, but also other factors connected with them such as their overall performance in the competition, and the overall feedback he has received about them. Whereas in Series 7–8, the Interviews stage was the final task, prior to these series and after them, the task sees the finalists being able to form a team out of a selection of returning candidates that had been fired over the course of the competition, their choices affected by past experiences with them, how well they worked together, or if their skill set can help improve their chances of winning.\n\nFor Series 1–6, the final stage was a purely business-styled task, as a final test of a candidate's skill set and their suitability to the job being offered as a prize in these series. For Series 7–8, following the change of prize, the task primarily focused on determining how potential a candidate's business plan was for investment, via interviews. Since the ninth series, the final task reverted to a similar format prior to Series 7, though was altered in that the finalists' task is to promote their business idea, presenting their proposed plan along with its brand identity to a group of industry experts. In all versions, the finalists eventually reconvene at the boardroom in which Sugar discusses with them over their performance, the feedback they got, and voices his final opinions of the candidates, Eventually, he declares his choice, proclaiming to the winner he points to with the words \"You're hired!\", at which point the winner departs in Sugar's limousine and conducts a brief victory interview, reflecting on their success in the competition.\n\nWhile only two finalists ever reach the final stage, Series 4 featured four finalists, who were divided up into pairs, working as joint project managers respectively on the final task, with Sugar effectively firing the pair who performed poorly, and making his final decision on who won, between the candidates within the remaining pair.\n\nEach boardroom session featured in the show consists of the same setup for \"The Board\", in the form of a panel that evaluates the performances of the candidates in the competition. Along with Alan Sugar (the \"boss\"), the panel consists of his two personal advisers, who are assigned to watch over the candidates during each task of the competition; to date, four people have operated as Sugar's advisers, of which two currently remain a part of the show in this respective role. The following details each member of the board:\n\nThe first series began in February 2005, with the opening theme being \"Montagues and Capulets\". The viewer ratings climbed to almost 4 million viewers for the final episode on 4 May 2005. The winner of this series was Tim Campbell, who had previously worked as a Senior Planner within the Marketing and Planning Department of London Underground. After his victory he went on to become Project Director of Amstrad's new Health and Beauty division at the time, but left the company to pursue other interests the following year, starting up the Bright Ideas Trust in 2008 which offers funding and support for young people wishing to start their own business.\n\nIn August 2008, the American cable channel CNBC began to present the first series on Monday nights, but it was aired in disparate time slots or not at all due to the network's abrupt shifting of their programme schedule in order to cover developments regarding the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, leading to the series not being broadcast in full. With CNBC deciding to focus their prime time schedule on financial news programming, the programme's rights were moved to BBC America, where it started transmission on 5 May 2009.\n\nThe second series began on 22 February 2006, with a spin-off programme introduced on BBC Three to air alongside it called \"\". The series finished with a record of 5.7 million viewers watching the final being won by Michelle Dewberry. Dewberry briefly took up a post under Sugar following the series, but left in September 2006 after a series of personal problems.\n\nFor the third series, 10,000 applications were received by the production staff, with a promise made to incorporate \"tougher tasks and better people\", after Alan Sugar expressed concerns that the show was becoming similar in format to that of \"Big Brother\". Alongside this, the BBC also revealed that the programme was being moved over to BBC One and aimed at a more \"mainstream audience\", with the broadcaster subsequently moving \"The Apprentice: You're Fired!\" to BBC Two as a direct result.\n\nThe series started on 28 March 2007 with viewing figures of 4.5 million, climbing throughout the run to a peak of 6.8 million people, all watching the final being won by Simon Ambrose.\n\nCandidates applying for the fourth series were invited to do so through the programme's official website, leading to 20,000 applications being submitted for the series, and 16 of them making it through to take part in the show. Its first episode aired on 26 March 2008, with its debut attracting 6.4 million viewers. This climbed to around 8.9 million viewers for the final episode, with an additional 800,000 viewers tuning in for the episode's final 15 minutes, to catch Lee McQueen winning the series. Lee went on to initially work for Sugar's company AMSHOLD, where he phoned in sick on his first day.\n\nPrior to the start of filming for the series, Adam Freeman, one of the lucky sixteen that had made it onto the fifth series, was forced to pull out; it was stated that his reasons for doing so were due to a \"family matters\". This meant that when the series began on 25 March 2009, viewers got to see fifteen candidates vying for the prize, with Margaret Mountford announcing her decision to stand down as a participant of the show during its broadcast, officially confirming it on \"You're Fired\". The series was won by Yasmina Siadatan.\n\nFollowing Mountford's departure, Karren Brady was officially revealed as her replacement on 30 August 2009, later revealing in a newspaper interview on 28 February 2010 that the contestants would no longer refer to Alan Sugar as 'Sir Alan', but instead must call him 'Lord Sugar', following his elevation to the House of Lords. Because of the 2010 General Election being held in the United Kingdom, the BBC opted to delay the sixth series until after it had been held, as Alan Sugar had ties to the government at the time; although he stated his intention of maintaining his position in the show, the running of \"The Apprentice\" during the general election could have been a \"risk to impartiality\". Advertising of the series commenced after it was held, throughout the Summer, with the opening episode eventually broadcast on 6 October 2010. This series was the first to feature a two-hour crossover special between the main programme and its spin-off, \"You're Fired\", a format that would be used in the series final of both in subsequent years.\n\nThe series was won by Stella English, who was placed into Sugar's company Viglen. In May 2011, she requested a new role after saying that she was just a \"glorified PA\", and retained this for a year before it was decided not to renew her contract. The decision drew considerable media attention, after she attempted to sue Sugar for wrongful dismissal in February 2012, only for the legal action to be ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nApplications for the seventh series began in April 2010. Between the applicants being processed, to the filming of the first task, Sugar announced that the prize had been changed, and that now participants of the show were competing for an investment from him of £250,000, with Sugar becoming their business partner, owning a 50% share, but also providing guidance and support from himself and a team of experts to help develop the winning candidate's plan. Those applying prior to this announcement, were not aware of the prize change until later on. The sixteen candidates who eventually secured a place on the series were revealed on 3 May 2011, via the official website and in a press launch, with the opening episode aired a week later on 10 May.\n\nIn a change to format, the final involved the Interviews that candidates undertook, though these included a scrutinising of the candidates' business plans as well. Thomas Pellereau became Sugar's first business partner, whereupon he used his prize to launch a range of manicure products with assistance from Sugar, including a line of curved nail files – the S-file, the S-Buffer and the Emergency File, two curved nail clippers, the S-Clipper and S-Clipper mini and a curved foot exfoliator, and the S-Ped – which were made available with major retailers in the country. While Susan Ma failed to win the series, Sugar said that he liked her plan, later investing into her skincare company Tropic in 2012.\n\nThe eighth series began on 21 March 2012, and was the last to use the format for the task layout as was used in the previous series. The series was won by Ricky Martin, who used his prize to launch his joint venture recruitment company called Hyper Recruitment Solutions (HRS), on 23 October 2012, which was designed to deal with recruitment in the field of science. Ricky was subsequently invited back to appear on the tenth series as an interviewer.\n\nThe ninth series began on 7 May 2013, and saw the format of the task layout reverted to its original approach prior to the seventh series, though with the final task amended to focus on the investment prize, in which the finalists of the process had to conduct a presentation of their business idea to a panel of experts, including branding, an advert, and answering any questions given about their proposal. The series was won by Leah Totton, who used her prize to open her first cosmetic skin clinic on 22 January 2014.\n\nBecause of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2014 Commonwealth Games, the tenth series was postponed until mid-Autumn to avoid clashing with the live coverage of both sporting events. To commemorate the programme's tenth year, the series featured 20 candidates, with two of the tasks dedicated towards the items that had featured within them. The series began on 14 October 2014, was won by Mark Wright, who used his prize to start an SEO business called Climb Online. The series was the last to feature Nick Hewer, who announced his decision to depart from the show during its broadcast, officially confirming it on the series finale, during the \"You're Hired\" half of the episode.\n\nDue to the 2015 General Election, the show was postponed until mid-Autumn, to avoid clashing with the political event due to Sugar's ties with it at the time. Because of Hewer's departure, Claude Littner was confirmed as his replacement prior to the opening episode of the eleventh series on 14 October 2015, though he retained his role as one of the key interviewers of the Interviews stage. The\nproduction staff now focused on applicants who were older and more experienced in business, with the number of candidates taking part now increased to 18. The series was won by Joseph Valente, who used Sugar's investment and assistance to help him expand his plumbing business, Impra-Gas. The pair worked together on developing the business model for two years, until Valente announced in early 2017 that he intended to go solo and would be assuming full control. Both men parted ways on good terms, with Valente thankful for the help and opportunity that he had gotten, while Sugar wished him the best of luck and that he would be following the company's progress.\n\nAs before, the BBC postponed the twelfth series to mid-Autumn, so as to avoid clashing with live coverage of Euro 2016, the 2016 UK EU membership referendum and the 2016 Rio Olympics that were to take place during the Summer. The series began on 6 October 2016, and was won by Alana Spencer, who used her investment to kickstart a nationwide bakery business called Ridiculously Rich.\n\nThe thirteenth series of the show was broadcast in late Autumn 2017, maintaining the broadcast schedule set by the previous three series. The series began on 4 October 2017, and was won by both James White and Sarah Lynn, making it the first time in the show's history where two finalists were joint winners. Each would go on to use their individual investment to set up their own business – White would use his to start up an IT recruitment firm called Right Time Recruitment, while Lynn would use her investment to start up an online personalised sweets gift service called Sweets in the City.\n\nUnlike the last three series of the programme, the fourteenth series, which took place in late Autumn 2018, reverted to involving 16 candidates vying for Sugar's investment offer, and included a number of subtle changes to keep the format fresh such as candidates being sent abroad for the first task. The series began on 3 October 2018, and was won by Sian Gabbidon.\n\nAs with the previous series, the format for the fifteenth incorporated the new changes introduced, including the first task taking place abroad, the number of candidates taking part being at 16, and teams not being named until each consisted of a mix of women and men. The series began airing on 2 October 2019. The series was won by Carina Lepore, who will be using Lord Sugar's investment to fund new stores for her \"family-run\" baking business across London.\n\nAlthough filming for the series had been planned for 2020, the coronavirus pandemic that year had impacted many television productions. Lord Sugar eventually revealed in April 2020 that production had been postponed by the BBC, in response to government guidelines.\n\nEvery series of \"The Apprentice\" is pre-recorded before its broadcast – although the show's twelve-week broadcast schedule gives the impressions that each episode was filmed over a period of 12 weeks, in reality, each series' filming schedule is conducted within a two-month period, a few months before the show is to be aired. While the candidates do have a break between tasks to relax within the large rented house or apartment with which they are provided by the production team for the duration of the competition, each task is generally performed with a much closer time-frame than it appears on the programme.\n\nCompared to the US series, the British version has a more rigid format that requires the production team to provide enough footage for each series, that is to be then incorporated into twelve separate episodes. Early rules in filming meant that multiple firings were not allowed in the first two series, a fact that was acknowledged as an issue by Sugar when he expressed his desire to fire both Alexa Tilley and Syed Ahmed following a task in the second series, but could only get rid of the former. In subsequent series, this rule was changed after the show increased the number of candidates for the competition, meaning that Sugar could conduct double firings where needed by the film crew as part of the filming schedule.\n\nFilming for many of the tasks involve locations within London and across the UK in various cities and towns, and on a number of occasions when tasks take the teams abroad, across Europe, Northern Africa, the Middle East, and the United States. For each series, the candidates are provided with accommodation within an upmarket area of London selected by the production team, with every episode's opening and ending scene being filmed at this location, utilising a mixture of exterior and interior shots of scenes; filming is also done on site if the candidates are conducting work on a task within the building.\n\nFor other outdoor shots used as part of the other scenes in an episode, the locations have varied. Between the first and third series, both the show's opening credits and the post-firing \"walk of shame\" exit sequences were filmed outside the Amstrad HQ building in Brentwood, but from the fourth series onwards, following Amstrad's sale to BSkyB in 2007, filming of these scenes are done in front of the Viglen HQ building in St Albans, Hertfordshire, which until that point had been used a filming location for the interviews stage of the competition, and continued to do so until 2014 when it was decided to change the filming location to the Leadenhall Building. In addition, between the fourth to ninth series, the show's Walk of Shame scene was filmed at night, but the tenth series changed the filming schedule to have this done during the afternoon. For the scenes involving the losing team discussing their loss, the film crew have used two cafes – \"The Bridge\" in Acton, West London; and \"La Cabana 2\" in North London – though editing of these scenes is done to make it appear that candidates only enter The Bridge cafe.\n\nAlthough the show uses footage taken by its film crew for most of the episode shown, aerial footage of various buildings in London is used on \"The Apprentice\", mainly to acts as small links between scenes and as part of the show's opening credits, and have included shots of the Square Mile and Canary Wharf financial districts, as well as the 180-metre Gherkin, HSBC Tower, One Canada Square, the Citigroup Centre, and the Shard; such locations are not used for filming unless a task involves visiting the site.\n\nFilming of an episode can usually take a considerable amount of time to be done and as such, each task is usually filmed back-to-back, rather than weekly as it appears in the broadcast schedule for a series. For each episode, four television crews are used to follow the candidates during a task, and often are focused on picking up on mistakes and issues between candidates, than on their overall performance. The final edit of an episode often trims down a task that took 1–3 days to be done, to fit it within approximately about half of what will be televised for that episode, meaning candidates may appear to make minimal contributions when in reality they made more, while others may not feature as much if Sugar or his advisers feel they did well and completed their duties, as emphasis is often put on moments that can be entertaining for audiences. Often the filming of an episode can hamper the efforts of candidates in a task, due to film crews usually having to get filming permission first from the respective owner of a store or establishment, which can often be a time consuming and cumbersome process as a result, whilst the strict rules of the BBC on product placement and advertising mean candidates have to approach businesses with care when asking them for help.\n\nOwing to the need for secrecy during the two months of filming, all candidates are made to sign a confidentiality agreement which prohibits all, but a few confidants nominated by them, to be told of where they will be during that time, which remains active after filming until the series has started broadcast. As part of this agreement, all contact with the outside world is restricted to a high level – each candidate gets a limited phone call once a week, have no access to newspapers, television or internet,and is required to hand in any electronic communication equipment they have (i.e. mobiles) before they begin. In addition, all candidates are made to remain in their accommodation throughout filming except when they must head out for a task, and can only take a day off if they are supervised by a chaperone from the production crew. As a result, the persistent presence of the cameras, the closeness of rivals in the competition and the lack of contact with families and friends, can cause considerable pressure and stress for a candidate between entering the process, to leaving it.\n\nScenes filmed in both the \"boardroom\" and the reception area that resides next door to the room, are in fact done within a custom-built set at Black Island Studios, with the boardroom receptionist actually being an employee of the production company, Talkback Thames, and not Alan Sugar's real secretary. Filming of each candidates' \"walk of shame\" exit sequences is mainly done towards the beginning of a new series, which can lead to the fired candidate's clothing and hairstyle being different to that in their final boardroom scene before their dismissal from the competition. The post-firing taxi ride that occurs after their departure does not take the candidate home as it appears in the show, but merely takes them around the block to allow their taxi interview to be filmed, after which they are then taken to a local hotel to stay the night before being finally allowed to leave after packing up their belongings from the house.\n\nFor the final, multiple endings are filmed for the candidates who make it to the end of the process, although Sugar does not reveal who he will hire until shortly before transmission. This determines which ending is shown as part of the series finale's final edit. Notably, the BBC has released two statements regarding the decision procedure which are considered to be contradictory; while the first states that Sugar makes his decision on the day that the final boardroom sequence is filmed, based on the contestants' performance in the final task, and keeps it secret until just before transmission, the second states that he decides after a six-month trial period. Former candidate, Saira Khan, notably stated that his final decision \"is not based on the programme that people see\", but is based on \"these two people [who] have been working with him for the six months.\"\n\nFollowing the decision to commission a second series of the programme, the BBC decided to create a spin-off companion programme to accompany \"The Apprentice\", with its format operating in a similar manner to that of \"Big Brother's Little Brother\" and \"\". Originally aired on BBC Three, before it was moved to BBC Two alongside the main programme's move to BBC One, the show is broadcast alongside the latest series of the main show, with each episode featuring the host and a group of guest panellists – business people related to the task, presenters of TV/radio programmes, and comedians – performing an in-depth look into the recent task of the programme, while also interviewing the most recently fired candidate(s) and analyzing their performance. The shows are recorded at Riverside Studios, and is hosted by Tom Allen; it has been previously hosted by Adrian Chiles, Dara Ó Briain, Jack Dee and Rhod Gilbert.\n\nFollowing the second series of \"The Apprentice\", the BBC announced that, as part of its early-2007 programming schedule, a celebrity version of the programme would be recorded in aid of the charity Comic Relief, entitled \"Comic Relief Does The Apprentice\". While the format of the American celebrity edition, \"The Celebrity Apprentice\", was filmed to be a full series when it was broadcast, the Comic Relief special functioned on a simple format, in which it featured ten celebrities split between two teams – a \"boys' team\" and a \"girls' team\" – and consisted of two parts covering a single task, with any money raised going to the 2007 Comic Relief fund, though it would retain certain key elements from the main programme, such as the boardroom scene and Sugar \"firing\" one of the celebrities. Filming of this special was conducted on 15 December 2006, with the celebrities that participated being Piers Morgan, Alastair Campbell, Cheryl Cole, Danny Baker, Jo Brand, Karren Brady, Maureen Lipman, Ross Kemp, and Trinny Woodall; the special also featured Rupert Everett, though he was later replaced by Series 1 winner, Timothy Campbell, after he left on the first day of the task. The two part special aired on 15 and 16 March 2007 on BBC One, the second part as a film segment for \"Red Nose Day 2007\", with the celebrities raising over £1 million for charity.\n\nA section celebrity edition of the show was made for Comic Relief two-years later in 2009, with the two-part special of \"Comic Relief Does The Apprentice\" airing on 12 and 13 March 2009, with the celebrities that participated being Alan Carr, Jack Dee, Gerald Ratner, Jonathan Ross, Gok Wan, Michelle Mone, Patsy Palmer, Fiona Phillips, Carol Vorderman and Ruby Wax. Although Ross had been suspended by the BBC over the prank telephone call row that occurred during the time that the special was being filmed, the broadcaster permitted him to appear in it due to the fact that it would be airing after his suspension had been lifted.\n\nThe beginning of the third series saw the launch of a weekly podcast called \"The Apprenticast\", and a radio programme on BBC Five Live, both hosted by former \"Blue Peter\" presenter Richard Bacon and running for thirty minutes. Both programmes featured former candidates being questioned by members of the public, comedians, and those who work in business. Some critics have described Bacon's performance as better than that of Adrian Chiles, who presented the similar, but television-based, programme \"\"\n\nFor the 2009 series, an independent weekly podcast was also released, hosted by first series contestant James Max, in conjunction with London talk station LBC (on which Max hosts his own show).\n\nAfter the first \"Comic Relief\" celebrity version proved a success, the BBC gave the green light for an edition the following year, this time being a two-part special entitled \"Sport Relief Does The Apprentice\", and airing on 12 and 14 March 2008, as part of Sport Relief 2008. The format remained the same as the Comic Relief version, with the celebrities that participated being Phil Tufnell, Nick Hancock, Lembit Öpik, Kelvin MacKenzie, Hardeep Singh Kohli, Lisa Snowdon, Jacqueline Gold, Louise Redknapp, Clare Balding and Kirstie Allsopp.\n\nAs the main programme began to grow in success, Sugar took notice of the number of young viewers the show was attracting, and went into discussions with the BBC in March 2008 to propose the creation of a junior spin-off of the show, featuring a young age-group of candidates and being aired in an early evening timeslot on BBC One. Despite a lack of interest, Sugar went into negotiations on the idea in early 2009, whereupon the BBC gave the green light for the project after the idea was revised. In May 2009, while the fifth series of \"The Apprentice\" was underway, the broadcaster announced the spin-off's production during an episode of \"The Apprentice: You're Fired!\" with news that it had begun an application process aimed at young candidates aged between sixteen and seventeen. Both the filming schedule and the format of the spin-off differed greatly with the main show, with the most notable differences being that Sugar was gentler with the young candidates when firing them from the spin-off, the candidates faced mainly standard tasks and no interviews, and the winner received a £25,000 investment from Sugar to fund their further education and future prospects.\n\nThe first series of the programme began on 12 May 2010, under the title of \"Junior Apprentice\", consisted of 10 candidates split evenly between gender, and ran for a total of six episodes. It also marked the debut of Karren Brady as Margaret Mountford's replacement, after she left the main show following the fifth series; Brady would later begin her first appearance on \"The Apprentice\" at the start of its sixth series. The spin-off later led to the BBC commissioning two more series, though with a few changes – the show was renamed as \"Young Apprentice\", with the number of candidates increased to twelve and the number of episodes increased to eight. The second series began airing on 24 October 2011, while the third began on 1 November 2012.\n\nThe spin-off was eventually cancelled after its third series, after Sugar revealed on his Twitter account in February 2013 that the BBC had decided to not renew \"Young Apprentice\" for another series.\n\nThe following is a list of specials that have aired alongside the majority of the series:\n\nThe following is a list of programmes that were one-offs:\n\nAlongside specials connected to the main show, an \"Apprentice\" Special of \"The Weakest Link\" aired on BBC One on 30 May 2008. It featured memorable candidates from past series of \"The Apprentice\" along with \"Apprentice\" narrator Mark Halliley replacing Jon Briggs as gameplay voiceover.\n\nThe show has been imitated in the ITV programme \"Harry Hill's TV Burp\". It was also mocked in the BBC impression programme \"Dead Ringers\", in which Sir Alan Sugar turns fired contestants into frogs and the candidates are portrayed as failed applicants of \"Strictly Come Dancing\" and \"Big Brother\" who are seeking their 15 minutes of fame.\n\nRory Bremner did an impression of Sir Alan on the show \"Bremner Bird and Fortune\"; he was in the boardroom with the main London Mayoral candidates, Boris Johnson, Ken Livingstone and Brian Paddick, and after each of the candidates failed to get a single vote according to his results, he hired himself for the job claiming he \"would make a profit on City Hall\". In \"Dead Ringers\" Bremner also impersonated a Sir Alan with magic powers castigating a contestant over an event akin to what occurred to \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\".\n\nIn early 2007, the show was mocked in the television programme \"Kombat Opera Presents The Applicants\". The series has been lampooned on the Boleg Bros website, where it is shot in Lego. Paul Merton and Ian Hislop also parodied the show during a promotional advert for the 2007 and 2008 series of \"Have I Got News for You\".\n\nIn June 2007, shortly after the conclusion of Series Three of \"The Apprentice\", rival UK channel ITV began airing \"Tycoon\", described in \"The Times\" as \"a shameless rip-off of The Apprentice\". Mark Thompson, The BBC's director general, accused ITV of \"copycatting\" and said that \"Tycoon\" was \"very like The Apprentice, and there's possibly a bit of Dragons' Den in there\". The series followed \"Dragons' Den\" star Peter Jones' search for a new business tycoon. It proved relatively unsuccessful and was removed from a prime time slot on Tuesdays after achieving fewer than 2 million viewers, over 2.5 million below the channel's average. The final episode attracted just 1.3 million viewers. The programme's winner, Iain Morgan, won a prize of over £200,000.\n\nIn the fourth series of \"Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe\", Brooker parodied \"The Apprentice\", with Brooker taking on the role of a Sugar-like character dressed in a crown and gown, and replacing the catchphrase, \"You're fired\" with \"You're fucked.\"\n\nThe children's comedy sketch show \"Horrible Histories\" features \"Historical Apprentice\" as a recurring sketch. This directly references \"The Apprentice\" and Sugar, and features two different teams from different historical periods.\n\nSugar starred in a mock clip of \"The Apprentice\" within the 2012 \"Doctor Who\" episode, \"The Power of Three\".\n\nSeries have expanded outside television with a number of University student groups recreating local competitions by sticking to the format of tasks. What is known as Student Apprentice competitions have been hosted across the country in a number of Universities, especially in London. Events became so popular competitions joined as Regional Student Apprentice in London and other regions in UK. In 2013, these were joined to form National Student Apprentice, which became a competition bringing together six regions for a national event.\n\nIn May 2014 Harry & Paul's \"Story of the Twos\" parodied the show, with Harry Enfield as Sugar.\n\nThe programme has been given positive reviews by several newspapers. In the popular press, \"The Sun\" newspaper has called it \"The thinking man's reality show\", and \"The Daily Mirror\" described it as \"jaw-dropping viewing\". Broadsheet newspapers have given the programme a similarly positive reception, with \"The Daily Telegraph\" calling it \"The most addictive show in years\", and \"The Guardian\" saying that it provided \"A salutary lesson in aggressive buying and selling, hiring and firing\". \"The Sunday Times\" said that it was \"not just a game show: it's a business school.\" \"The Evening Standard\" was also favourable, describing the programme as \"terribly compelling\".\n\nAccording to a report released by Ernst & Young in August 2013, the rise of popular television programmes like The Apprentice, have helped to encourage and foster an entrepreneurial culture across the UK. The report revealed that 71% of entrepreneurs surveyed thought the UK encourages an entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nThe programme has been criticised in the British media for suggesting that success in the business world requires possession of unsavoury qualities. Terence Blacker of \"The Independent\" newspaper, for example, said that he believed that the programme falsely linked success with being \"nasty, disloyal, greedy and selfish\". Talk show host Sir Michael Parkinson has also expressed misgivings about the programme, describing it as being \"full of vulgar, loud people who, for all the wrong reasons, are dobbing each other in\".\n\nThe premise of the show itself has been called into question by some members of the business world. Steve Carter, the head of recruitment firm Nigel Lynn, described the \"brutality\" of the recruitment process as being unrealistic. None of the winners of the first six series of \"The Apprentice\" stayed with Sugar's companies over time, some for only a matter of weeks, leading it to be criticised as \"an entertainment show with no real aspect of business to it\". In response to these criticisms, a spokesperson for \"The Apprentice\" has been quoted as saying \"The show isn't designed as a tool for recruiters... but it does highlight and thoroughly test key business skills such as leadership, teamwork, dedication and strategic thinking – integral skills most recruiters are looking for\".\n\nFormer contestant and runner-up Saira Khan has criticised the programme because the final two candidates both work with Sir Alan Sugar for a few months before he decides whom he will hire. Khan stated that \"Sir Alan Sugar's final decision is not based on the programme that people see, his final decision is based on these two people who have been working with him for the six months.\" Khan also said that the show is more concerned with giving viewers a rags-to-riches ending than employing the most able candidate, and that the show promotes bullying in the workplace. The series has been notably edited afterwards to show the winner in a different light. This has led to some viewers correctly guessing the winner of the series partway through the series.\n\nFormer contestants Lucinda Ledgerwood and James Max have criticised the tasks on the show as being too heavily sales-focused and designed for entertainment rather than as tests of all-round business skills.\n\nA number of people have criticised the show's editing and production methods. Contestants Syed Ahmed and Tre Azam accused the show of dumbing down their appearances for entertainment. Gerri Blackwood said that her boardroom scene was filmed again to make it look better. Alan Sugar himself revealed in his autobiography (but did not criticise) that the boardroom scenes are edited to create tension. Jokes and light hearted encounters are cut out, and Alan is seen \"banging the table\".\n\nMedia Watch has voiced concerns over inclusion of company names and products such as Chrysler in the programme, accusing the producers of breaking BBC policy regarding product placement. Despite these claims, Talkback Thames has denied any suggestion of product placement.\n\nThe show received criticism from viewers during series six after it was revealed that orders placed in the programme were not genuine.\n\nRunner up of the eleventh series, Vana Koutsomitis criticized the living conditions that candidates live in; despite being granted accommodation in a lavish house, Vana claimed that the show bosses impose living conditions similar to Big Brother – with strict rules and zero contact with outsiders. She said: \"They just throw you into a house and tell you that you have no phone, no internet and you’ll have no contact with the outside world, You can only talk to your family once a week for 10 minutes and that’s monitored. And we weren’t allowed to go to Boots to grab something. We had to be monitored and guided there.\" She continued; \"I think that element of cabin fever and psychological torture is not necessary for a business competition. I don’t believe that you need to isolate people. I think you can gauge people’s business skills without putting them in that environment.\n\nVana's criticism of the living conditions that candidates live in which they have zero contact with outsiders was also brought up a year later by contestant Aleksandra King, who left the process in the fourth task. Following her departure, she remarked: \"I can't tell you in exact detail how much contact I was allowed with my family but, for me, the restricted contact was not good enough. I would have liked to have picked up the phone and just said, \"How are you guys? OK, Great.\" I was not able to do that. I've got a nine-year-old, a seven-year-old and a five-year-old but it's the work-life balance thing because there are other mums in there who have younger kids and it was OK for them. But for me, I started to get slightly irritated because I felt like why is this even a business tip, what has lack of contact with my family got to do with it? It was winding me up and going on in my head.' King later remarked that The Apprentice includes a \"blame culture\" and the atmosphere \"wasn't necessarily great for business\".\n\nThroughout the programme's history, \"The Apprentice\" has received high viewing figures with each series. When its first series was broadcast in 2005 on BBC Two, it attracted an average of 2.5 million viewers per episode, with an audience share of 11% for its timeslot that allowed it to beat popular programmes being aired on rival channels at the time, such as \"Desperate Housewives\". By the following year, the second series achieved a far higher average of 4.4 million viewers and an audience share of 27%, surpassing those achieved from the live broadcast of the 2005 UEFA Cup Final and other televised programming, such as the film \"Pearl Harbor\".\n\nViewing figures continued to improve upon the programme being switched to BBC One and a more mainstream audience, with the third series attracting an average of 5.62 million viewers per episode, at an audience share of 27%, surpassing the ratings achieved by programmes, at the time, such as \"City Lights\", \"Grand Designs\" and \"Big Brother\". Notably, opening and finale episodes also attracted favourable ratings – the premiere episode of the fourth series achieved around 6.4 million viewers, with the finale reaching a peak figure of 9.7 million. Even special editions of the programme proved a rating success – \"Comic Relief Does The Apprentice\" attracted 6.72 million viewers when it was broadcast prior to the third series, becoming the fifth most-watched programme on BBC One the week it aired.\n\nAccording to BARB figures, the most viewed series to date is the seventh series – it achieved an average of 8.8 million viewers per episode. For individual episodes, the following table lists the 10 highest rating episodes of \"The Apprentice\", to date, per BARB figures:\n\"The Apprentice\" won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) for \"Best Feature\" during the 2006 awards, beating \"Top Gear\", \"Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares\" and \"Dragons' Den\". It was also nominated for a BAFTA for \"Best Feature\" at the 2007 awards, but was beaten by \"The Choir\".\n\nOther awards that the programme has won include:\n\nOn 10 February 2005, Lord Alan Sugar released a book to coincide with the first series, called \"The Apprentice: How to Get Hired Not Fired\". On 16 February 2006, the book was revised with additional information relating to the second series. An official magazine was first released on 23 May 2007. It includes items about business, interviews with candidates from the programme and other \"Apprentice\"-related features.\n\n\"The Apprentice\" has included various pieces of classical and popular music throughout. Numerous pieces from film soundtracks are used as well as music featured in the BBC TV series Doctor Who. Examples of the music used include the opening theme (\"Dance of the Knights\" from \"Romeo and Juliet\" by Prokofiev) and \"The Boardroom\", \"You're Fired\" and \"Closing Credits\" from \"The Apprentice (Original Theme)\" by Dru Masters. An official soundtrack was released on 4 June 2007. At the beginning of the first episode of Series 6, the iconic string phrase from the first movement of Gustav Mahler's Sixth Symphony can be heard in, one might surmise, a numerological nod. Further episodes in Series 6, include an extract from a piece by the French composer and pianist, Erik Satie, (from his \"Gymnopédies No 1\"), music from the Disney-Pixar 2009 film, Up, composed by Michael Giacchino, and a famous extract from Benjamin Britten's opera, Peter Grimes. A number of episodes also featured brief snippets of several tracks from The Sims series of games, such as the neighbourhood theme from The Sims 3, was briefly used in the last episode of series 6 and one of the build tracks from Makin' Magic was used in Series 7 episode 8.\n\nIn 2009, a DVD called \"\"The Apprentice: The Best of Series 1–4\"\" was released.\n\n"}

The 20-bed hospital opened in July 1925. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948 and was directly managed by the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. After services transferred to the Eastern General Hospital, despite public protests about the proposed closure, the facility closed in 1988. Following assurances that another maternity unit in the city would be named after Inglis, one journalist suggested renaming the Royal Hospital for Children and Young People after her.\n\nThe original maternity facility subsequently re-opened as a private nursing home and nursery, but following an investigation into the death of a 59-year-old woman, it closed again in 2011. The building was subsequently demolished and the site is now occupied by residential properties.\n"}
{"id": "1904601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904601", "title": "White's illusion", "text": "White's illusion\n\nWhite's illusion is a brightness illusion where certain stripes of a black and white grating is partially replaced by a gray rectangle (Fig. 1). Both of the gray bars of A and B are the same color and opacity. The brightness of the gray pieces appear to shift toward the brightness of the top and bottom bordering stripes. This is in apparent opposition to lateral inhibition as it cannot explain this occurrence. This occurs even when the gray patches in the black stripes are bordered by more white than black (and conversely for the gray patches in the white stripes). A similar illusion occurs when the horizontal strips have different colors; this is known as Munker–White's illusion or Munker's illusion.\n\nThe amount of each bipolar cell response depends on the amount of the stimulation it receives from the receptor and the amount that this response is decreased by the lateral inhibition it receives from its neighboring cells.\n\nLateral inhibition cannot explain White's illusion. In Figure 2.1 lateral inhibition sent by black cells A and C should make cell O lighter; in Figure 2.2 lateral inhibition sent by white cells A and C should make cell O darker. It is suggested that brightness induction follows the brightness contrast in the direction of the bar not the surrounding area.\n\nIn Figure 2.1 we assume that light dropping on cells B and D generates a response of 100 units. Since the points A and C are darker we assume that only 20 units are generated from these points. Another assumption is that the lateral inhibition sent by each cell is 10% of its response; cells B and D send an inhibition of 10 units each and cells A and C send an inhibition of 2 units each. The inhibition sent by cells A and C is larger since their size is bigger than the size of cells B and D (let's say 2 times). This concludes that cell O receives an inhibition \n\nIn Figure 2.2 with the same assumptions as above stated, cell O receives an inhibition of I = 10 × 2 + 10 × 2 + 2 + 2 = 44.\n\nBecause point O in Figure 2.1 receives an inhibition smaller than the point O in Figure 2.2 the gray cell should be lighter.\n\nWhite and White (1985) concluded that at a higher spatial frequency the grating of White's illusion could be described by brightness assimilation. They also concluded that at lower spatial frequencies White's illusion is still present.\n\nBlakeslee and McCourt (2004) suggested that patterns whose scales are larger compared to the encoding filters (low spatial frequency) are represented with a loss of low frequency information exhibiting brightness contrast; patterns whose scales are smaller compared to encoding filters (high spatial frequency), are represented with a loss of high frequency information exhibiting brightness assimilation.\n\nOur perception of an area's lightness is influenced by the part of the surroundings to which the area appears to belong.\n\nA disc example consists of four discs on the left which are identical to four discs on the right in terms of how much light is reflected from the discs, that is to say, they are physically identical. The theory to explain the different psychological experiences is called belongingness.\n\nThe discs on the left appear dark and the ones on the right appear light, this is because of the two displays. In the display on the left, the dark area on the left seemingly belongs to the discs, and the discs are obscured by the light mist. On the right side, the same dark areas are interpreted as belonging to the dark mist. In the meanwhile, the white parts are seen as the color of the discs. Therefore, our perception of the lightness of the discs is significantly influenced by the display, which is the mist in this case (Anderson & Winawer, 2005).\n\nThe belongingness theory has been suggested as an explanation of White's illusion. According to belongingness theory, the lightness of rectangle A is influenced by the white display, which should be the white bars that surround it. Similarly, the rectangle B on the right side is surrounded by the dark bars, and the lightness of rectangle B is affected by the dark background. As a result, area A which rests on the white background appears darker than area B which rests on the dark background.\n\nBelongingness theory only explains why rectangle A looks darker than rectangle B and does not discuss why the gray area on rectangle A looks darker than in rectangle B; secondly, when talking about the background, Belongingness theory appears quite the same as simultaneous contrast theory, they just use different names. Kelly and Grossberg (2000, P&P, 62, 1596-1619) explain and simulate these perceived differences and various other surface brightness and figure-ground percepts, such as those arising from Bregman-Kanizsa, Benary cross, and checkerboard displays, using the FACADE theory of 3-D vision and figure-ground perception.\n\n"}

Different honorifics might be applied depending on the particular status of the deceased. These honorifics are frequently found on gravestones, on memorial walls inside the sanctuary of synagogues, in speeches, and in writing such as in obituaries.\n\nIn writing, it is most common to use the name followed by an abbreviation of an honorific either in Hebrew or English. For examples, see chart.\n\nThe following chart shows different honorifics used, along with their abbreviation in Hebrew and English, their translation, the masculine and feminine forms, the type of person which the honorific is applied to, and examples.\n\nSome honorifics may be used for any individual. These honorifics are generally not used for rabbis or other special persons, since the specific honorifics for those people are used instead, as a sign of honor and respect. See below.\n\nThe most common honorific is \"of blessed memory,\" and the Hebrew transliteration is \"zikhrono livrakha\" (m.) / \"zikhronah livrakha\" (f.) (Hebrew: (f.) \"'\" \\ (m.) \"'\"). It is often abbreviated in English both as\" OBM \"and as\" “\"'Z\"L” The Hebrew abbreviation is \"'.\"\n\nAlthough in the past it was common to use this expression for living people as well In the Babylonian Talmud, it is mentioned that a person should say this expression about his dead father, in addition to the phrase \"I am the atonement of his bed\".\n\nAn alternative honorific is \"Peace be upon him/her.\" The Hebrew version is \"alav ha-shalom\" (m.) / \"aleha ha-shalom\" (f.) (Hebrew: (m.) \"עליו השלום\" / (f.) \"עליה השלום\"). It is abbreviated in English as “A\"H.” The Hebrew abbreviation is \"ע״ה.\"\n\nThis phrase is the same as the Islamic honorific \"peace be upon him\" (which is used for all prophets of Islam). However, unlike in Islamic usage, the English abbreviation \"PBUH\" is not commonly used for the Jewish honorific.\n\nThe above two may be used interchangeably; however \"of blessed memory\" is the most common.\n\nIn the Talmudic era and earlier, the acronym ע\"ה stood for עבד השם (servant of God), and was only applied to specific Biblical personages whom the Bible had described as servants of God. However, after the Arab conquest, the Arabic phrase عَلَيْهِ ٱلسَّلَامُ (peace be upon him) was translated to Hebrew עליו השלום and was used for any deceased person, a usage which spread to the Jews of Christian Europe beginning in the 12th century. The phrase עליו השלום came to predominate over עבד השם, and by 1600 usage of עבד השם had disappeared, leaving עליו השלום (or its feminine/plural forms) as the only expansion of ע\"ה.\n\nThis honorific \"May HaShem avenge his/her blood\" is generally used for an individual who perished as a result of anti-semitism, for example pogroms or the Holocaust. The term is also applied to any innocent Jew killed, whether for anti-Semitic reasons or others. The Hebrew phrase is \"HaShem yikom damo\" (m.) / \"HaShem yikom dama\" (f.) / \"HaShem yikom damam\" (pl.) and in the Hebrew: \"השם יקום דמו\" (m.) / \"השם יקום דמה\" (f.) / \"השם יקום דמם\" (pl.). The English abbreviation is “HY\"D” and in Hebrew \"הי״ד.\"\n\nOther expressions used to add to the names of people who died: \"the deceased\", \"rest of Eden\", \"rest in peace.\" It is customary to sign the tombstones with the initials תַּנְצְבָ\"ה (תְּהִי נִשְׁמָתוֹ צְרוּרָה בִּצְרוֹר הַחַיִּים (, according to the language of the verse: and the soul was a pure soul in the chorus of life).\n\nThe abbreviation “זי״ע/zy\"a” stands for \"\"zekhuto yagen `aleinu\"/May his merit shield us,\" and often follows the mention of meritorious righteous ones. A variant is “זיע״א/zya\"a” which adds \"Amen\" at the end. This expression stems from the belief that a righteous person who passes to the next world can serve as an advocate before God for his remaining community. Other acronyms of this type are נבג\"מ (נשמתו בגנזי מרומים; his soul in the heavenly vineyards) and נלב\"ע (נפטר לבית עולמו; died to his world).\n\nThe honorific \"May the memory of the righteous be a blessing\" is used after the names of holy rabbis and other holy people, and \"the name of the wicked shall perish\" on a wicked person. both from . \n\nIn Hebrew transliteration: \"zekher tzadik livrakha\" and in Hebrew: \"זכר צדיק לברכה.\" The English abbreviation commonly used is “ZT\"L” and in Hebrew, \"זצ״ל\" is used. It is pronounced in reading as \"\"zatzal\".\" It may be also written as “ZTz\"L”.\n\nIt is used primarily in reference to rabbis who have been deceased in recent memory. Thus, one is likely to write “Rabbi Moshe Feinstein ZT\"L” (d. 1986) but far less likely to write \"Rashi ZT\"L\" (d. 1105).\n\nIn the course of time, additional versions of the above expressions were created, for example: \"זכר צדיק וקדוש לברכה\"; \"may the memory of the righteous and holy be a blessing\" (ZTVK\"L; זצוק״ל), \"may the memory of the righteous and holy be a blessing for the life of the world to come\" (זצוקללה״ה).\n\nWhile the above mentioned positive honorifics are added to the names of beloved people, the names of particularly wicked (evil, despised) people are sometimes embellished with the phrase \"Yimakh shemo\" ימח שמו, \"May his name be blotted out\".\n\n"}

Wet electrons are attracted to positively charged hydroxide ions which form on oxide surfaces in the presence of atmospheric moisture. These electrons in turn affect the interaction of other materials with the oxide.\n\nHydrogen atoms on water or hydroxide (OH) can be involved in hydrogen bonds or be dangling. Wet electrons are primarily stabilized by the dangling atoms on OH, which is more acidic than water, but the dangling atoms on water also contribute to the stabilization. The process is akin to following the lowest elevation path between valleys with a mountain between them. The minimum energy necessary to change an electron from the solid to the liquid state corresponds to going through the wet electron state. Wet electrons are a transition state (saddle point) between electrons in the liquid and solid states.\n"}

Leybourne popularised the song which premièred in August 1866 at the Princess' Concert Hall in Leeds. For the act, he caused some controversy when he appeared in a cut down top hat, similar to a style worn by the murderer Franz Muller. It was one of Leybourne's most famous songs and he would later be nicknamed Champagne Charlie.\n\nLeybourne's rival Alfred Vance introduced a number called \"Cliquot\", starting a fierce competition between the two men.\n\nEnthusiasm for the song was increased with its use in November 1866 in the new \"Operatic Burlesque\" called \"The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan\", or \"The Little Bill that was Taken Up\". The song was sung by the crowd at the public execution of Michael Barrett in 1868, the last public execution in Great Britain.\n\nIt later featured in the play \"Champagne Charlie\" and, with changed lyrics, the 1944 film \"Champagne Charlie\" featuring Tommy Trinder and Stanley Holloway. It is also heard as a background song a few times in the \"Jack the Ripper\" (1988) television movie starring Michael Caine. It is sung by Miriam Hopkins in the 1931 version of \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr.Hyde\" but with the refrain \"Champagne \"Ivy\" is my name.\"\n\nA substantially revised version of \"Champagne Charlie\" was recorded in 1932 by the American blues singer Blind Blake. Blind Blake's version was later covered by the jazz musician Leon Redbone on his album of the same name in 1978.\n\nThe melody of the original song was adapted by The Salvation Army for their hymn, \"Bless His Name He Sets Me Free\".\n\n"}

It has operations in the United Kingdom (known as Yell), the United States, and Spain (known as Paginas Amarillas). It has its origins in the yellow pages division of the privatised British telecommunications operator BT Group.\n\nIn 1966, Post Office Telecommunications – a division of the UK General Post Office, launched the first UK Yellow Pages classified directory in Brighton, Sussex. Yellow Pages were rolled out across the UK by 1973, and became the first information provider on Prestel.\n\nYellow Pages became a separately identified business within the BT Group after BT was privatised in 1984. The red fronted \"Business Pages\" launched in 1985 in Bristol and South Wales, and the telephone directory enquiries information service \"Talking Pages\" was piloted in Brighton and Bristol from 1987, which then became known as 118 24 7 after 2003. The group launched Yell.com, its UK local search engine, in 1996 and acquired YellowBook USA in 1999 for $665 million.\n\nThe Group was renamed Yell in 2000 and BT restructured in 2001 and agreed to sell the Yell directory business to private equity firms Apax Partners and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst (today operating in Europe as Lion Capital LLP) for £2.14 billion/$3.5 billion, making it then the largest non-corporate LBO in European history.\n\nYell bought McLeodUSA, one of the largest independent directory publishers in the US for about $600 million in 2002, and floated on London's FTSE in 2003.\n\nIn May 2005, Yell announced the acquisition of U.S. directory publisher TransWestern Publishing (and its holding company TransWestern Holdings L.P. from a consortium of private equity firms (Thomas H. Lee Partners and CIVC Partners for $1.575 billion (£829 million). TransWestern operated in 25 states and had core positions in California and Texas. The deal went through later in the year, making Yell's U.S. subsidiary Yellowbook the fifth largest directory publisher in the United States at that time. TransWestern had been acquired by CIVC Partners in 1993 and was used as a vehicle for additional acquisitions of smaller directories publishers in the western US. In 1997, TransWestern completed a leveraged recapitalisation in which Thomas H. Lee Partners and Providence Equity Partners acquired a 60% interest in the company, with CIVC retaining a minority interest. In 2001, TransWestern acquired Texas-based WorldPages.com, Inc., a leading print and Internet yellow pages publisher listed on the New York Stock Exchange for $215 million. At the time, TransWestern was the second largest independent publisher of directories.\n\nIn April 2006, Yell agreed to purchase a 59.9% stake in Spanish phone directory firm Telefónica Publicidad e Informacion (TPI) from Telefónica, and launched a bid for the remaining shares which valued TPI at a total of 2.3 billion (€3.3 billion; US$4.1bn). Since then, Yell has bought further capital and in September 2007 reached agreement with the minority shareholders to acquire the remaining 1.28% of what was then named Yell Publicidad (now named Hibu Connect S.A.U., operating under the name Páginas Amarillas España). In July 2006, Yell threatened Yellowikis with legal action, claiming that people will confuse the two organisations. In 2008, Yell Group purchased the Pindar Set business and renamed it Yell Adworks.\n\nIn May 2009, Yell UK announced an alliance with Google to provide search marketing services to small businesses, followed by Yell Publicidad in January 2010. In June 2009, Yell Group announced the appointment of Bob Wigley as Chairman, following the announcement in May 2009, that existing chairman Bob Scott would step down. In September 2009, Yell's US arm, Yellowbook, acquired Texas and Louisiana assets of ypOne Publishing, the 10th largest independent yellow pages publisher in the US. Yell announced the completion of its refinancing in November 2009, as first announced in June 2009 and updated in September the same year.\n\nIn February 2010, Yell UK announced the first major redesign in forty years of the traditional Yellow Pages directories into a smaller compact size rather than the traditional A4 format.\n\nIn May 2010, Yell Group purchased TrustedPlaces, a user-contributed local review site, and its US arm Yellowbook, announced the launch of a new group buying website called Weforia.com in August 2010.\n\nSeveral management changes were made in 2011. Mike Pocock was appointed Yell Group CEO from 1 January 2011, replacing previous CEO John Condron. Richard Hanscott was named CEO for the UK part of the business in June, reporting to Mike Pocock. In October, Scott Moore was appointed Group Chief Digital Officer.\n\nIn July 2011, Yell announced the acquisition of Znode, the privately owned multi-store ecommerce company and strategic alliances on digital services for small businesses with both Microsoft and Bazaarvoice. On 14 July, Yell announced a four-year plan to move away from traditional print and online advertising and focus on providing a broader range of digital services for both small businesses and consumers.\n\nIn September 2011, Yell announced an alliance with mobile platform company Netbiscuits.\n\nIn 2011 the company reported spending £160 million on interest payments and incurring losses of £1.4 billion.\n\nIn May 2012, Yell announced that it was changing its name to Hibu, pronounced \"high-boo\" and styled \"hibü\", with rebranding undertaken by Landor. The company's shareholders approved the change of name at its annual general meeting held on 27 July 2012, and the new name became effective from 30 July 2012.\n\nThe company continued to acquire additional companies, with Moonfruit, a DIY website company, purchased in May 2012 for £18m.\n\nIn September 2012, it warned that it is working with a number of capital options that which may attribute little or no value to the group’s ordinary shares, it also warned profits would miss forecasts owing to the ongoing decline of its directory business.\n\nAs part of a strategic review of the business, in Spring 2014 Hibu decided to discontinue its US magazine business, having taken similar actions in the UK, Spain and Latin America.\n\nOn 3 March 2014, Hibu announced that the financial restructuring of the group is now effective following consent from lenders, clearance from the UK Pensions Regulator and court sanction. All of Hibu’s operations were transferred to a new group holding company, held privately by lenders.\n\nOn 18 August 2014, Hibu UK changed their customer facing brand back to Yell. They re-launched with an updated range of products including websites, pay-per-click advertising and a new display advertising proposition. As of June 2015, Yell has created over 54,000 websites and managed 20,000 PPC campaigns for customers in the UK.\n\nThe company operates in the classified advertising markets in the UK and US through digital, printed and telephone-based media.

Arnal (September 6, 1909 in (Castilsabás (Huesca),—September 7, 1982 in Antibes, France) was a Spanish comics artist, who nevertheless worked in France for most of his career and was naturalized as French citizen. He is most famous for the comics series \"Pif le chien\" and \"Placid et Muzo\".\n\nDuring his youth in Barcelona he worked as cabinetmaker and as repairman of calculators. He published his very first graphic works in magazines like \"Pocholo\" or the famous \"TBO\", with a character called \"Top\", a humanized dog that later became the famous \"Pif le chien\".\n\nIn 1936, after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he enrolled in the Republican militia and was forced into exile in France after the end of war. In 1940, while his adoptive country was under German occupation, he was captured and deported to the Mauthausen concentration camp, as were many other Republican exiles. He would not leave until the end of World War II, in 1945.\n\nIn 1946 he published the first cartoons of \"Placid et Muzo\", an anthropomorphic fox and bear, in the weekly publication \"Vaillant, le journal de Pif\". He was a frequent collaborator of \"L'Humanité\", the newspaper of the French Communist Party. In this publication appeared for the first time in 1948 his most celebrated character, the dog Pif, and two years later he would draw Pif's inseparable partner, the cat Hercule, ending in the comic strip \"Pif et Hercule\".\n\nPif gave name in 1969 to a magazine, \"Pif gadget\", of great success during the 1970s, in which French and European cartoonists published their works, and which survived the death of its creator (with many cartoonists adopting Pif and Hercule into their own creations).\n"}

The magi, dispatched by King Herod, have found and paid homage to the Infant Jesus. In this verse this they return home rather than to Herod.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 2:12\n\nThat the Magi had no idea of Herod's malicious intentions, despite his reputation and the threat posed by a new king, is to Keener a sign of their innocent naivete and further contrast with Herod's malevolence.\n\nUnlike in Matthew 1, no source of the dream is mentioned, but it likely meant to have come from the same angelic source as Joseph's dreams. In addition to astronomy, Magi were also well known as interpreters of dreams.\n\nReturning a different way has often been seen as a metaphor for the effect finding Christ has on a person's life. Clarke notes that Gregory the Great commented that \"having come to know Jesus we are forbidden to return by the way we came.\" F. Dale Bruner notes that the word \"way\" often has theological overtones in Matthew and that a reference to verses such as and that discuss the \"way of salvation\" might be implied.\n\nAt this point the magi leave the narrative and do not reappear. There are many traditional stories about what happened to them after this. One has them baptized by St. Thomas on his way to India. Another has their remains found by Saint Helena and brought to Constantinople. From there they eventually made their way to Germany and the Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral now reportedly holds their remains. Marco Polo in his writings claimed that he saw the perfectly preserved bodies of the three men in Saveh in Persia on his journeys.\n\nBruner notes that in this verse Matthew refers to just \"Herod\" not \"King Herod\" as earlier in the chapter. Herod is never again referred to as king in the chapter. Bruner speculates that the worship of the infant by the Magi had altered things and Herod had been supplanted as the true king.\n\nFor a discussion of what country they might be returning to see .\n\n"}

He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball from through . A six-time All-Star, Bailey was one of the top catchers in the National League in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nBorn in Strawberry Plains in Jefferson County, Tennessee, Bailey batted left-handed, threw right-handed and was listed as tall and . A younger brother, Jim, was a left-handed pitcher who had a brief big-league trial as Ed's teammate on the 1959 Cincinnati Reds.\n\nEd Bailey signed with the Reds in 1950 as an amateur free agent. He reached the Majors in 1953 and in 1955 he was given a chance as the Redlegs' (the Cincinnati team's nickname from 1953–58) starting catcher, replacing Andy Seminick. When his offensive production floundered, the Redlegs traded Seminick for catcher Smoky Burgess and Bailey was sent down to the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League. With the help of some batting advice from Redlegs manager and former catcher Birdie Tebbetts, his hitting improved in the minor leagues and continued to improve in the Venezuelan Winter League.\n\nBailey began the 1956 season as the backup catcher to Burgess, but when the team faltered early in the season, Tebbetts decided to shake things up and named Bailey as the Redlegs' starting catcher. By mid-season, he was the leading hitter in the National League with a .335 batting average, helping to spur the Redlegs into first place. His hitting performance earned him a place as the starting catcher for the National League in the 1956 All-Star Game. The Redlegs stayed in the pennant race until the last day of the season, ending up with a 91–63 record, two games behind the Brooklyn Dodgers. Bailey ended the 1956 season with career-highs in batting average (.300), home runs (28), runs batted in (75), and led the league in baserunners caught stealing (23).\nIn 1957, the Redlegs were once again in first place at mid-season, but faltered to finish the season in fourth place. Bailey earned his second consecutive start for the National League All-Star Team, led National League catchers with a 46.2 Caught Stealing percentage and finished second to Roy Campanella with a .992 fielding percentage. He remained as the Reds' starting catcher for the rest of the 1950s up until 12 games into the 1961 season, when he was traded to the San Francisco Giants for second baseman Don Blasingame and catcher Bob Schmidt.\n\nIn 1962, Bailey platooned with catcher Tom Haller, as the two players—both left-handed hitters—combined to give the Giants 35 home runs and 100 runs batted in from the catcher's position. In June of that year, Bailey had a streak of 3 clutch home runs in four games that propelled the Giants into first place. The Giants battled the Los Angeles Dodgers in a tight pennant race as the two teams ended the season tied for first place and met in the 1962 National League tie-breaker series. The Giants won the three-game series to clinch the National League championship. Bailey appeared in six games of the 1962 World Series, hitting a home run in Game 3 as the Giants lost to the New York Yankees in seven games. He had another strong year in 1963, hitting 21 home runs with 68 runs batted in, earning his fifth and final All-Star berth.\n\nIn December 1963, Bailey was traded along with Felipe Alou and Billy Hoeft to the Milwaukee Braves for Del Crandall, Bob Hendley and Bob Shaw. He served as Joe Torre's back up for two seasons with the Braves before being traded back to the Giants in February 1965. After just fourteen games of the 1965 season, he was traded again, this time to the Chicago Cubs, where he served as a backup catcher to Vic Roznovsky. On July 22, 1965, Bailey hit a grand slam home run, a three-run home run and a run-scoring single to drive home eight runs during a game against the Philadelphia Phillies. After the season, he was traded to the California Angels and was released after appearing in only five games of the 1966 season.\n\nIn a fourteen-season major league career, Bailey played in 1,212 games with 915 hits in 3,581 at bats for a .256 batting average along with 155 home runs and 540 runs batted in, including 423 runs, a .355 on-base percentage and a .986 fielding percentage. He was a five-time All-Star and led National League catchers in baserunners caught stealing and caught stealing percentage once each. At the time of his retirement, he ranked 11th overall for career home runs by a catcher. His younger brother, pitcher Jim Bailey, also played in the Major Leagues. When his brother joined the Reds in 1959, the Bailey brothers became one of the few brother-batteries in Major League history.\n\nIn between, Bailey guided both the Lácteos de Pastora and Industriales de Valencia to Venezuela League championship titles, and later played with them in the Caribbean Series tournament in 1954 and 1956, respectively.\n\nIn , Bailey and six of his Redleg teammates—Roy McMillan, Johnny Temple, Don Hoak, Gus Bell, Wally Post and Frank Robinson—were voted into the National League All-Star starting lineup, the result of a ballot stuffing campaign by Redlegs fans. Major League Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick intervened, removing Bell and Post from the starting line up and replacing them with Hank Aaron and Willie Mays. Frick allowed Bell to remain on the team as a reserve while Post was removed from the team altogether. The Commissioner also transferred the responsibility for All-Star voting to the players, managers and coaches the following year.\n\n\nBailey later served for 12 years on the Knoxville, Tennessee city council from 1983 to 1995 and, worked for United States Congressman Jimmy Duncan. He died in Knoxville in 2007, following a battle with throat cancer.\n\n\n"}

The album peaked at no. 6 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 and no. 12 on the UK Albums Chart. All three singles released from the album were Top 40 hits in the United States. An anniversary edition was released 21 February 2005, featuring 7 bonus tracks, as well as a 35-minute DVD.\n\nThe Power Station was a supergroup formed by Robert Palmer, Tony Thompson (of Chic) and Andy and John Taylor from Duran Duran. They came together in 1984 to record a one-off album, as a respite from the relentless global touring and promotion of Duran Duran.\n\nThe original plan for this one-album project was for the three musicians (Taylor, Taylor and Thompson) to provide musical continuity to an album full of material, with a different singer performing on each track. Those who were approached included Mick Jagger, Billy Idol, Mars Williams (who eventually contributed brass to the album) and Richard Butler (of The Psychedelic Furs), and Mick Ronson.\n\nThe group then invited eclectic soul singer Robert Palmer to record vocals for the track \"Communication\". When he heard that they had recorded demos for \"Get It On (Bang a Gong)\", he asked to try out vocals on that one as well, and by the end of the day, the group knew that they had found that elusive chemistry which distinguishes successful bands. Before long, they had decided to record the entire album with Palmer.\n\nHowever, the union was not to hold. By the time the band decided to take the 8-track set on the road, Palmer had left to record his solo album \"Riptide\" (which, likely because of the involvement of The Power Station participants Edwards, Thompson, and Andy Taylor, is very similar in sound to The Power Station album). He was replaced by Michael Des Barres (famed for co-writing Animotion's \"Obsession\").\n\nDuring the promotion cycle for the album, EMI released three singles, including the cover of T. Rex's \"Get It On\". Versions of these three singles are now included among the bonus tracks on the 2005 re-release.\n\nIn addition, the re-release also includes the song \"Somewhere, Somehow, Someone's Gonna Pay\", the only known Power Station song featuring Michael Des Barres on lead vocals. The song was used for the end titles of the Arnold Schwarzenegger action film \"Commando\" and was titled \"We Fight for Love\".\n\nWhile the actual name of the album is \"The Power Station\", the specific formats were adopted as part of the name (similar to PiL's 1986 \"Album\"), thus \"The Power Station 33\" vinyl album, and \"The Power Station CD\" on Compact Disc.\n\nAll songs written by Robert Palmer, Andy Taylor, and John Taylor; except where noted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Narratives sequence people/characters in time and place but differ from recounts in that through the sequencing, the stories set up one or more problems, which must eventually find a way to be resolved. \nThe common structure or basic plan of narrative text is known as the \"story grammar\". Although there are numerous variations of the story grammar, the typical elements are:\n\nThe graphic representation of these story grammar elements is called a story map. The exact form and complexity of a map depends, of course, upon the unique structure of each narrative and the personal preference of the teacher constructing the map.\n\nThere are many types of narrative. They can be imaginary, factual or a combination of both. They may include fairy stories, mysteries, science fiction, romances, horror stories, adventure stories, fables, myths and legends, historical narratives, ballads, slice of life, personal experience.\n\nFeatures:\n\nIn a Traditional Narrative the focus of the text is on a series of actions: \n\nFurther more, when there is plan for writing narrative texts, the focus should be on the following characteristics:\n\nIt aims at explanation, i.e. the cognitive analysis and subsequent syntheses of complex facts. Example: An essay on \"Rhetoric: What is it and why do we study it?\"\n\nThere is a chance that your work may fall flat if you have not chosen one of the really good expository essay topics. Not all topics out there are interesting or meaty enough to be thoroughly investigated within a paper. Make sure you put effort into choosing a topic that has a lot of material to cover it and pique the interest of readers!\nComparing the past and the present is a good way of framing an argument, especially if a lot has been written about it.\n\nBased on the evaluation and the subsequent subjective judgement in answer to a problem. It refers to the reasons advanced for or against a matter. The writer usually argues with another side to convince the reader to join a certain side.\n\nA literary text is a piece of writing, such as a book or poem, that has the purpose of telling a story or entertaining, as in a fictional novel. Its primary function as a text is usually aesthetic, but it may also contain political messages or beliefs. American schoolchildren and their parents are taught that literary texts contrast with informational texts that have the purpose of providing information rather than entertainment. Informational texts, such as science briefs and history books, are increasingly receiving emphasis in public school curricula as part of the Common Core State Standards. As a result, many parents have challenged the idea that literary texts are of less pedagogical value than informational ones.\n\n"}

Common sites for pannus formation include over the cornea, over a joint surface (as seen in rheumatoid arthritis), or on a prosthetic heart valve. Pannus may grow in a tumor-like fashion, as in joints where it may erode articular cartilage and bone.\n\nIn common usage, the term \"pannus\" is often used to refer to a panniculus (a hanging flap of tissue).\n\nThe term \"pannus\" is derived from the Latin for \"tablecloth\". Inflammation and exuberant proliferation of the synovium leads to formation of pannus and destruction of cartilage, bone, tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels. Basically, the hypertrophied synovium is called pannus. Pannus tissue is composed of aggressive macrophage- and fibroblast-like mesenchymal cells, macrophage-like cells and other inflammatory cells that release collagenolytic enzymes.\n\nIn people suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, pannus tissue eventually forms in the joint affected by the disease, causing loss of bone and cartilage. From Autoimmunity and Disease by Harley Y. Tse and Michail K. Shaw:\n\nIn ophthalmology, pannus refers to the growth of blood vessels into the peripheral cornea. In normal individuals, the cornea is avascular. Chronic local hypoxia (such as that occurring with overuse of contact lenses) or inflammation may lead to peripheral corneal vascularization, or pannus. Pannus may also develop in diseases of the corneal stem cells, such as aniridia. It is often resolved by peritomy.\n"}

He was first Adjunct Professor in Drammen until 1846, when he was appointed headmaster at the Christiania Cathedral School, a position he held until 1880.\nKnudsen became involved in the development of the national debate which resulted in the \"Riksmål (later\" \"Bokmål) and Landsmål\" forms of the written Norwegian language. As an educator, he had observed that students had difficulty writing in the Danish language, when they spoke the Norwegian language. He came to believe that the written language should be changed to match common speech. In this regard, Knudsen came to exercise influence among his contemporaries, including Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson.\n\nKnudsen was one of the first to propose Norwegianization (\"fornorskninglinjen\"), the rewriting of loanwords into a Norwegian spelling (e.g. turning chauffeur into \"sjåfør\"). His aim was to give a more Norwegian coloring to the literary language of Norway by adapting the orthography and syntax to Norwegian usage, and by substituting wherever it was possible, Norwegian words for foreign derivatives. He wanted changes that could occur in the shortest time possible and consequently put forward several reforms working within the Danish written language. The most comprehensive treatment of the subject may be found in his \"Unorsk og norsk, eller Fremmedords avlösning\" (1879-1881).\n\n\n\n\n"}

His younger half-brother is American/British musician Siegfried Faith-Evans. As a Roman Catholic, his godparents were Leo Brent Bozell II and Patricia Lee Buckley. His parents divorced in Egolf's childhood and he took the surname of his stepfather, Gary Egolf. It was life in Philadelphia, however, that inspired Egolf, along with summer visits to his father's new home in Indiana. He graduated from Hempfield High School in Landisville, Pennsylvania, in 1990. Egolf briefly attended Temple University, in Philadelphia.\n\nEgolf dropped out of Temple and joined a punk rock band \"Freak Thing\", later \"Kitschchao\". The band did release one 7\" single on Compulsiv Records, but after the band was dissolved Egolf wanted to focus on his writing and moved to Paris, which he said was the best place to write about Kentucky, where \"Lord of the Barnyard\" was to be set. For 18 months, he wrote during the day and subsidized his rent by playing guitar in Irish bars and on the Pont des Arts as a street musician.\n\nIn Paris, Egolf struck up an acquaintance with Marie Modiano. Her father Patrick Modiano, French author and screenwriter (\"Lacombe Lucien\") and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, helped Egolf get his first novel published in France in 1998 by Gallimard after it had been rejected by more than 70 U.S. publishers. \"Lord of the Barnyard\" was subsequently published in the United Kingdom and the United States and received moderately favorable reviews – with a few raves worldwide. His second book, \"Skirt and the Fiddle\", was published in 2002 to even better critical response; his third, \"Kornwolf\", was published after his death. He had also been working on a screenplay for \"Lord of the Barnyard\", left unfinished.\n\nOutside his writing, Egolf achieved some renown as a political activist. In July 2004, he and a group of friends, later known as the Smoketown Six, were arrested outside Lancaster, Pennsylvania, for stripping down to thong underwear and piling on top of one another alongside a road that was being traveled by US President George W. Bush to protest the Abu Ghraib prison-abuse scandal.\n\nOn May 7, 2005, shortly after completing the manuscript for \"Kornwolf\", Egolf committed suicide in his apartment in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

Located 90 kilometres south of the Namibian capital Windhoek, Rehoboth lies on a high elevation plateau with several natural hot-water springs. It receives sparse mean annual rainfall of , although in the 2010/2011 a record were measured. In 2005, it had a population of 21,378 later increased to 28,843 in 2011, according to the 2011 Namibian Population and Housing Census.\n\nRehoboth is intersected from north to south by the national road B1, which also serves as the border of the two electoral constituencies in the town, Rehoboth Urban West and Rehoboth Urban East. Rehoboth is the core territory of the Baster community which still lives according to their \"Paternal Laws\" which were enacted in 1872.\n\nRehoboth is divided into eight neighbourhoods, called blocks. The oldest part of the town is blocks A, B and C, of which block B contains most public services and shops. Block D is home to the wealthiest inhabitants of the town. Block E is the poorest neighbourhood and was originally (under Apartheid) designated for blacks. Blocks F,G and H are the newest neighbourhoods. The current mayor of the town is Mr. Pieters, living in Block E.\n\nPublic amenities include a public hospital, primary and secondary schools and a district court with resident magistrate. The Oanob Dam, approximately six kilometres from Rehoboth, supplies the town with fresh water. The majority of the population consists of Basters.\n\nThe aboriginals of Rehoboth and its surroundings are the now seemingly extinct and or greatly assimilated/ accultured San (Haiǁom) and the Damaras, of the ǃAinîn traditional community (or rather the Dama of the ǃAib [aka ǀHūǃgaoben]), a sub clan of the ǀGowanîn (Dune Damaras/ Damaras of the Kalahari). They first came upon the hot water springs after the fall of the Damara cohession in the 16th century and named the site ǀGaoǁnāǀaus (Fountain of the falling buffalo). The ǃAinîn later permanently settled at ǃNawases NE of Rehoboth in the mid 1700s under the reign of chief Xomaǀkhāb (third in line of chieftain chronology) circa 1725- (1750). The traditional community is as per post-independent Namibian legislative framework is administred by a traditional authority (ǃAinîn Traditional Authority) under the reign of Kai ǀGarub (regnal title- \"Great Leopard\") Chief Hans Eichab. ǀGaoǁnāǀaus was later renamed ǀAnes (place of smoke) by the Kaiǁkhaun (Rooinasie Nama of ǃHoaxaǃnâs) who for a short period had settled there before migrating to Hoachanas. The \"smoke\" referred to the steam that was rising over the hot water fountains on cold winter mornings. The ǀHūǃgaoben decided to settle at a distance from the fauna rich springs of Rehoboth so as not chase away game roaming the site.\n\nIn 1845 ǁKhauǀgôan (Swartbooi) clan arrived under the leadership of Willem Swartbooi (ǃHuiseb ǂHaobemâb) and Franz Heinrich Kleinschmidt of the German Rhenish Missionary Society. Kleinschmidt named the place Rehoboth that year, and established a Rhenish Mission Station there. In 1864, the Nama abandoned the area as a result of an attack by the Orlam Afrikaners.\nRehoboth means \"streets\" in Hebrew. The arrival of the ǀHôaǀaran (Oorlam Afrikaner) in ǀAeǁgams (Windhoek) in 1840 marked the start of the ǀHôaǀaran-ǁKhauǀgôan (Oorlam Afrikaner-Swartbooi Nama) feud. This feud lasted from 1840 to 1865, as the Oorlam Afrikaner attacked the Swartbooi Nama at Rehoboth in a bloody clash resulting in the Swartbooi Namas fleeing to ǃAmaib in ǃOeǂgâb (Erongo region). The Rehoboth area was mostly bare except the Swartbooi Nama who were sheltered by the ǀHūǃgaoben.\n\nIn 1870, the Basters, who had migrated out of the Cape Colony in 1868, moved into the territory and were granted permission to settle at Rehoboth by the participants of the peace conference of Okahandja on 23 September 1870. Within a few years, the Basters were closely linked to the town of Rehoboth and became identified as Rehoboth Basters or Rehobothers. The population increased rapidly from an initial number of 333 in 1870, 800 in 1874 and 1500 by 1885. The growing Baster population settled in the surrounding areas, which would become known as the \"Rehoboth Gebiet\" (\"Gebiet\": ).\nIn 1885, Baster Kaptein Hermanus van Wyk signed a 'Treaty of Protection and Friendship' with the German Empire which permitted him to retain a degree of autonomy in exchange for recognizing colonial rule. Relations between Rehoboth and Germany remained close for more than twenty years, but in 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, Germany's use of Baster soldiers to guard South African prisoners — contrary to the terms of their enlistment — led to armed revolt. German forces then attacked Rehoboth, committed atrocities against Baster civilians and attacked refugees encamped upon the mountain of Sam Khubis, but, despite repeated attacks and the use of superior weaponry, were unable to destroy the Basters' position. On the following day the Germans retreated and Rehoboth's Baster community was reprieved.\n\nNamibia was occupied by South Africa in 1915 and, ten years later, a second rebellion broke out at Rehoboth. This revolt collapsed, however, when colonial forces, armed with machine guns and supported by two warplanes, marched into the town and arrested more than 600 people.\n\nAdministratively, Rehoboth is classified as a town with its own council of 7 elected individuals.\n\nThe 2015 local authority election was won by the SWAPO party which gained four seats (4,519 votes), while the local United People's Movement (UPM) gained three seats (3,101 votes).\n\nThe town is served by Rehoboth railway station. There is also a private landing strip, for small aircraft near the Oanob Dam. To the west is Gamsberg Nature Reserve.\n\n\n"}

It is published by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The equivalent European standard is EN 60529.\n\nThe standard aims to provide users more detailed information than vague marketing terms such as \"waterproof\". For example, a cellular phone rated at IP68 is \"dust resistant\" and can be \"immersed in 1.5 meters of freshwater for up to 30 minutes\". Similarly, an electrical socket rated IP22 is protected against insertion of fingers and will not be damaged or become unsafe during a specified test in which it is exposed to vertically or nearly vertically dripping water. IP22 or IP2X are typical minimum requirements for the design of electrical accessories for indoor use.\n\nThe digits indicate conformity with the conditions summarized in the tables below. The digit \"0\" is used where no protection is provided. The digit is replaced with the letter \"X\" when insufficient data has been gathered to assign a protection level.\n\nThere are no hyphens in a genuine IP code. IPX-8 (for example) is thus an invalid IP code.\n\nThis page contains a combination of IEC 60529 (also EN 60529) and other standards, such as ISO 20653. The original documents are available for purchase, and have important and specific requirements that cannot be fully reprinted due to copyright restrictions. This often includes drawings specifying the required test equipment, such as the shape of water nozzles used for water jet testing. Additional standards are often referenced that may contain important information. One must refer to the latest revision of the required standard when conducting tests for agency certification.\n\nThis table shows what each digit or part of the IP code represents.\n\nThe first digit indicates the level of protection that the enclosure provides against access to hazardous parts (e.g., electrical conductors, moving parts) and the ingress of solid foreign objects.\n\nThe second digit indicates the level of protection that the enclosure provides against harmful ingress of water.\nThe ratings for water ingress are not cumulative beyond IPX6. A device that is compliant with IPX7, covering immersion in water, need not be compliant with IPX5 or IPX6, covering exposure to water jets. A device that meets both tests is indicated by listing both tests separated by a slash, e.g. IPX5/IPX7.\n\nFor the protection of person against access to hazardous parts with:\nFor the protection of equipment specific to:\nThe letter K is specified in DIN 40050-9, and not in IEC 60529.\n\nDIN 40050-9 extended the newer IEC 60529 rating system with an IP69K rating for high-pressure, high-temperature wash-down applications. Enclosures conforming with ISO 20653:2013 must not only be dust-tight (IP6X), but also able to withstand high-pressure and steam cleaning.\n\nThe IP69K standard was originally developed for road vehicles—especially those that need regular intensive cleaning (dump trucks, concrete mixers, etc.)—but it also finds use in other areas, such as food processing machinery and car wash systems. It was superseded by ISO 20653:2013 Road Vehicles-Degrees of protection (IP code), and complemented by the addition of a level 9 water ingress testing to IEC 60529, which includes essentially the same spray test as IP69K, but also includes, in Figure 10, a drawing for a test fixture designed to verify the correct water pressure.\n\nThe test specifies a spray nozzle that is fed with 80 °C water at 8–10 MPa (80–100 bar) and a flow rate of 14–16 L/min. The nozzle is held 10–15 cm from the tested device at angles of 0°, 30°, 60° and 90° for 30 seconds each. The test device sits on a turntable that completes a rotation once every 12 seconds (5 rpm). The IPx9 specification details a freehand method for testing larger specimens that will not fit on a turntable (see table above). The free hand method also requires (at least) one additional minute of spray time (1 min/m, 3 min. minimum). The test distance also increases to .175 m (0.15–0.2 m per section 14.2.9).\n\nIn the US, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association defines NEMA enclosure types in NEMA standard number 250. The following table outlines which IEC 60529 IP code each respective NEMA rating meets. Ratings between the two standards are not directly equivalent: NEMA ratings also require additional product features and tests (such as functionality under icing conditions, enclosures for hazardous areas, knock-outs for cable connections and others) not addressed by IP ratings.\n\nThe inclusion of an ingress protection rating has become increasingly common for use in the consumer electronics market with devices such as mobile phones, tablet computers and cameras now being sold as water resistant, waterproof and dustproof.\n\nSome manufacturers have produced IP rated smartphones, aimed at consumers who are concerned about their handsets getting submerged in liquids or getting covered in dust.\n\nWith the availability of portable devices, and the desire to get outside with active lifestyles, portable speakers have become popular with the rugged consumer market for those who enjoy outdoor recreation, extreme sports as well.\n\n\n"}

It is home to Squaw Valley Ski Resort, the site of the 1960 Winter Olympics. Olympic Valley is the smallest resort area to host the Olympic Winter Games.\n\nNative American Washoe people used the valley as a summer tribal ground before the 1849 California Gold Rush. When westward bound travelers first encountered the valley, they saw only women and children as most of the men were away hunting and so called it Squaw Valley. Squaw is the historical name for indigenous North American women and is now considered an ethnic and sexual slur.\n\nThe town of Claraville, formerly located at the mouth of Squaw Valley was once among the biggest mining operations in the Lake Tahoe region. There were rumors that the mine was salted with ore brought in from Virginia City, Nevada. George Wharton James, author of the book \"The Lake of the Sky\" doubts the mines were salted with ore and suggests that the energetic prospector Shannon Knox started the mine with good faith. He writes about the History of the Tahoe Region (pre 1915) in many of the chapters of his book. The Squaw Valley Mining boom was short lived and by 1863–64 the valley had lost almost all of its inhabitants to the Comstock lode in Virginia City.\n\nBy 1942, Wayne Poulsen, a former star skier from the University of Nevada, had acquired 2,000 acres (810 ha) in Squaw Valley from the Southern Pacific Railroad. Poulsen met Alex Cushing, a Harvard University-trained lawyer, in 1946 while Cushing was vacationing at Sugar Bowl Ski Resort. During his vacation, Cushing toured Squaw Valley at Poulsen's invitation and decided to invest in building a ski resort there. Unlike Poulsen, Cushing had the political connections and access to the capital necessary to create a ski resort. In June 1948, the two founded the Squaw Valley Development Company and Cushing replaced Poulsen as president of the Squaw Valley Development Corporation by October 1949. Squaw Valley Ski Resort opened on Thanksgiving Day 1949. The resort was constructed with $400,000 raised by Cushing, including $150,000 of his own money. The creation of the Squaw Valley Development Corporation and Squaw Valley Ski Resort mark the modern era of Squaw Valley.\n\nIn 1954, Cushing began lobbying the International Olympic Committee to host the 1960 Olympic Winter games after he saw an article in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" that detailed Reno, Nevada's bid to host the games. Innsbruck, Austria was Squaw Valley's biggest competitor in the running for the 1960 Winter Games, and Squaw Valley won the right to host the games by a vote of 32-30 on the second ballot. In anticipation of the Olympics, the official name was changed to Olympic Valley in 1960. The 1960 Winter Olympics were the first Winter Olympics to be televised live and attracted millions of viewers.\n\nIn 2010, Squaw Valley Ski Resort was acquired by KSL Capital Partners, terming what they called a “renaissance” for Olympic Valley. With its acquisition, KSL announced $50 million in improvements to Squaw Valley. The total amount was increased to $70 million when Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows merged in October 2011. Investments include upgrading chair lifts and snow-making and grooming equipment.\n\nIn 2016, Squaw Valley Ski Holdings submitted a final application for entitlements for its proposed Village at Squaw Valley Specific Plan, a $1 billion plan that prompted the Attorney General of California to write a letter of concern to Placer County. The plan would include 850 hotel and condominium units and a 96-foot-tall “Mountain Adventure Camp” featuring a year-round indoor waterpark. According to the environmental review for the project, new development is projected to add 3,300 new car trips to local roads on peak days, and the project would have 20 “significant but unavoidable” impacts.\n\nSierra Watch, a California-based conservation advocacy group, started a grassroots campaign to “Keep Squaw True”, holding public events and circulating an on-line petition in opposition to KSL Capital Partners' proposed expansion plan.\n\nIn November 2016, the Placer County Board of Supervisors approved KSL’s controversial development proposal in spite of opposition from local conservation organizations, including Sierra Watch. Sierra Watch filed suit to overturn those approvals for violating the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in December 2016.\n\nIn 2017, resort owners added a roller coaster to their development proposal.\n\nThe climate of Olympic Valley is classified as \"Dsb\" (Continental Mediterranean Climate) under the Köppen Climate Classification. Summertime is generally mild to warm, with cool nights, and winter time is cold and snowy.\n\nSkiing and racing culture has been important to Olympic Valley since before it hosted the 1960 Winter Games. An athlete from Squaw Valley has competed in every Winter Olympics since 1964, when Jimmie Heuga competed in the IX Olympic Winter Games. Because of this, Squaw Valley has taken the moniker \"Official Supplier of skiers to the US Ski Team.\" Many members of the US Ski Team began skiing as a part of Squaw Valley's Mighty Mites racing team for five- to ten-year-olds.\n\nNotable winter athletes from Olympic Valley include:\n\nIn addition to hosting the 1960 Olympic Winter Games, Olympic Valley played host to the 1969 FIS World Cup alpine skiing races. It also hosted the US Alpine Championships in the years 2002, 2013 and 2014 and the US Freestyle Championships in 2009. The area also hosts non-skiing sporting events, including the Western States Endurance Run, which begins at the base of the Squaw Valley Ski Resort. The 2013 and 2014 Ironman Lake Tahoe triathlon also began and ended in Olympic Valley.\n\nOlympic Valley has hosted the Wanderlust music and yoga festival annually since 2009. Other musical performances held in Olympic Valley include concerts by Jerry Garcia Band, Jurassic 5, Matisyahu, Yonder Mountain String Band, The Wailers, Brett Dennen, and Big Head Todd and the Monsters.\n\nOlympic Valley is home to the Squaw Valley Community of Writers, the organizers of the Squaw Valley Writer's Conference, and the Squaw Valley Institute. The Institute aims to foster \"uncommon conversations\" and hosts speaker events and other cultural events. Alpenglow Sports, a local sporting goods store, hosts the Alpenglow Winter Film Series at Squaw Valley, in which athletes and explorers from around the world share stories about their experiences and adventures.\n\nOlympic Valley is an unincorporated area located in Placer County, California. Placer County services the area.\n\nIn August 2013, a group named Incorporate Olympic Valley (IOV) submitted a petition to the Placer County Local Agency Formation Committee (LAFCO) in order to begin the process of attempting to incorporate Squaw/Olympic Valley into a town named Olympic Valley. Proponents of incorporation originally wanted to include Alpine Meadows, California in its efforts, but the citizens of Alpine Meadows rejected the proposal.\n\nIn December 2013, IOV submitted a formal application to the LAFCO which outlined the boundaries of the town they are proposing. Squaw Valley Ski Resort submitted a request to the Placer County LAFCO asking that it be excluded from the proposed town in April 2014. The Resort at Squaw Creek and Squaw Valley Lodge, two additional major businesses in the Squaw Valley area, submitted a letter to LAFCO in June 2014 urging the committee to deny the IOV incorporation application and to exclude them from proposed town. Save Olympic Valley, a group of residents, property owners, and business owners backed by Squaw Valley Ski Resort, has also questioned and expressed concerns about the incorporation effort.\n\nIn November 2015, the Placer County Local Agency Formation Commission announced that its members would vote against incorporation of Olympic Valley. IOV formally withdrew its incorporation petition for Olympic Valley in early December.\n\nIncorporate Olympic Valley (IOV) is under investigation by the California Fair Political Practices Commission for allegedly violating multiple sections of the California Political Reform Act. The allegations relate to IOV's failure to file a statement of organization or monthly campaign statements for at least five months to the commission. Additionally, it is alleged that IOV did not include required disclaimers on campaign advertisements.\n\n"}

Around 1949 – 1960 there was a US military camp in Tannenbusch.\n\nOf the inhabitants, 45% have a migrant background. About 40% of the inhabitants in the district live on state welfare payments. A an Islamic salafi movement is active in the district.\n\nAlt-Tannenbusch was a settlement at the northwest outskirts of the town of Bonn, which was first developed between the wars, and developed further in the early postwar years. Alt-Tannenbusch surrounds a dune, which is a nature reserve, but is so closely forested that it is hard to tell. Among the inhabitants of the dune is a colony of free-living parrots. Today (2004) approx. 6,000 humans live in Alt-Tannenbusch.\n\nNeu-Tannenbusch was a planned large housing estate (satellite town), built at the beginning of the 1970s in response to the then dominant housing shortage. The settlement follows the ideal of \"modern living\" at that time. As a consequence, Alt-Tannenbusch has pronounced living areas with dense land development, broad roads with many parking possibilities and a central garbage collection system, as well as a spatially separated shopping centre and social services. For the building of Neu-Tannenbusch the route of the Rhine railway was shifted several kilometers and led in a cut by the new settlement. Today the Bonn suburban tram lines 63/16 serve the area.

It is an associate council of the World Council of Churches, a member of the Christian Conference of Asia and a partner of other national ecumenical bodies throughout the world. \"Act for Peace\" is the international aid agency of the NCCA, which aims to empower war-torn communities to protect refugees, reduce poverty, prevent conflicts and manage disasters.\n\nThe modern ecumenical movement began to take shape at the end of the 19th century. Initiatives among students and between church mission agencies led the way. In Australia these included the Australian Student Christian Movement, formed in 1896, and the National Missionary Council, created in 1926.\n\nOrganised ecumenism in Australia at the national church level was first formalised through the Australian Committee for the World Council of Churches (1946). This movement initially involved only the Anglican and Mainline Protestant churches. In the 1960s and '70s, however, Eastern and Oriental Orthodox churches joined the ecumenical movement. This developed into the Australian Council of Churches (ACC). Following the Second Vatican Council, the Roman Catholic Church in Australia began exploring possibilities for relationships with other churches. In 1994 the National Council of Churches in Australia (NCCA) succeeded the ACC, with the Catholic Church as a member.\n\nThe symbol of the boat has long been used to represent the ecumenical movement, and its origins are unclear - perhaps in the Gospel story of the calling of the Galilean fishermen to be disciples - \"fishers of men\". The boat represents the Christian Church as a ship sailing the sea that is the world. The mast, in the shape of the cross, recalls the Christian faith.\n\nThe NCCA's version of the boat includes waves and the Southern Cross and was adopted at the formation of the NCCA in 1994. The use of the Southern Cross identifies the NCCA's geographical location.\n\nAn updated version of the logo, pictured above, was adopted in 2006.\n\nThe NCCA currently comprises 18 member churches:\n\nSource: National Council of Churches in Australia website\n\n\n"}

His most used double bass is named \"Grammah\", after the Ladies' tour manager nicknamed him \"Grampah\" for always complaining and not wanting to get up.\n\nCreeggan was born in Scarborough, Ontario. His mother taught piano lessons to neighborhood children, which Creeggan credits as part of the reason for his interest in music.\n\nCreeggan has played the double bass since he was in school. He was a member of a variety of school bands, as well as local youth symphony groups. He also attended the University of Toronto for bass performance, though he did not complete a degree. Creeggan, along with his brother Andy, was invited to play with Ed Robertson and Steven Page (then performing as Barenaked Ladies as a duo) at a Christmastime show in Toronto, and the pair was asked to join the band permanently. Creeggan has been with the band ever since, while his brother left the band in 1995. He and Andy formed a group together named The Brothers Creeggan before Andy left BNL. They continued to play following his departure, and went on a hiatus in the early 2000s.\n\nHe regularly plays a double bass, both bowed and pizzicato. He has also played Electric double bass (including a Zeta bass circa \"Maybe You Should Drive\", and a couple Ned Steinbergers later on), and bass guitar for BNL. He won the 1999 best male bassist award from the Gibson Guitar Corporation. He uses a French bow for his double bass. He has occasionally played guitar on some Barenaked Ladies songs; mainly on songs which he sings lead (though he also plays bass on some of those). Creeggan has also contributed to albums with each of the other members of the violin family, and has orchestrated musical charts for various band instruments to be recorded by session musicians.\n\nCreeggan made minor contributions to the writing of the band's first two albums, in the form of several co-writes. His first major songs contributed to an album was for the band's third release, 1996's \"Born on a Pirate Ship\", which featured both \"Spider In My Room\" and \"In The Drink\"; two songs written exclusively by Creeggan, and both with him on lead vocals. He would record another song, \"Inline Bowline\" for 2000's \"Maroon\", but the track was left off the album (later released as a b-side/bonus track). The band instituted a new, more open writing process for their next album, and several of Creeggan's song ideas were expanded into songs featured on 2003's \"Everything to Everyone\".\n\n2004's \"Barenaked for the Holidays\" featured a holiday tune, \"Christmas Pics\", sung by Creeggan, and 2006's \"Barenaked Ladies Are Me\" features Creeggan singing lead on \"Peterborough and the Kawarthas\", among other Creeggan co-written songs included. The band's 2008 children's album, \"Snacktime!\" features Creeggan co-writes \"Louis Loon\" and \"Pollywog In A Bog\", the latter of which he sang. Creeggan wrote and sang lead on two songs from the band's 2010 album \"All in Good Time\", \"On The Lookout\" and \"I Saw It\", as well as a bonus track titled \"She Turned Away\". Creeggan wrote and sang a song for 2013's \"Grinning Streak\", titled \"Who Knew?\", that was left off the album and released as a bonus track. Creeggan wrote and sang a song titled \"Narrow Streets\" for the 2015 album \"Silverball.\n\nIn their first show since the 2009 departure of Steven Page from the band, Creeggan took over some of Page's harmony vocals, and his lead vocals on the song \"Maybe Katie\"; a song Creeggan originated with vocals split between Page and Robertson.\n\nCreeggan has played bass as a guest on a number of albums; mostly of Canadian artists. He also commonly joins artists opening for Barenaked Ladies who do not play with a full band.

A left-handed pitcher, he appeared in all or parts of seven seasons in Major League Baseball for the Milwaukee Braves (1961–1963), San Francisco Giants (1964–1965), Chicago Cubs (1965–1967) and New York Mets (1967).\n\nHendley's career was hampered by elbow miseries. But he is perhaps best remembered for hooking up with Baseball Hall of Fame left-hander Sandy Koufax of the Los Angeles Dodgers for two classic pitchers' duels while Hendley was a member of the 1965 Cubs.\n\nOn September 9 at Dodger Stadium, Hendley allowed only one hit, but Koufax threw a perfect game and defeated Hendley, 1–0. The one run Hendley gave up came in the fifth inning and was unearned. It came without the benefit of a hit: the Dodgers' Lou Johnson took a base on balls (Hendley's only free pass of the game), moved to second base on a sacrifice bunt, stole third base, and came around to score on a throwing error by the Cubs' catcher. Although now trailing in the game, Hendley was still throwing a no-hitter. Two innings later, however, Johnson got his club's only safety, a pop fly over the head of Cub first baseman Ernie Banks that fell for a double. The walk and bloop hit were the only baserunners that Hendley permitted. Koufax' no-hitter was his fourth (over four consecutive seasons) and his only perfect game. He struck out 14 Cubs, including the last six hitters in a row.\n\nFive days later, the two pitchers faced each other in a rematch at Wrigley Field. That time, Hendley gave up four hits and three bases on balls, but defeated Koufax 2–1.\n\nBorn in Macon, Georgia, the , Hendley graduated from Lanier High School and attended Mercer University. He signed with the Braves in 1958, and was in his fourth season in the Milwaukee organization when he made his MLB debut on June 23, 1961, a starting assignment against the Cubs at Wrigley Field. He battled into the eighth inning of a 2–2 tie, but left the game with the bases loaded and one out; two inherited runners then scored (one run was unearned), and Hendley took the 5–3 loss.\n\nHe was a member of the Braves' starting rotation in both and , then was traded to the Giants in a six-player deal on December 3, 1963; one of the three players the Braves received was Felipe Alou. Hendley was a member of the 1964 Giants' starting rotation, but began in the bullpen, making only two abbreviated starts among his first eight mound appearances. On May 28, Hendley, Harvey Kuenn and Ed Bailey were traded to the Cubs for Dick Bertell and Len Gabrielson. Although Hendley would be sent to Triple-A Salt Lake City for seven games, he was able to return to a starting pitcher role for the Cubs upon his recall, leading to his two September matches against Koufax.\n\nIn , Hendley became primarily a relief pitcher, earning seven saves for a Cub team that lost 103 games that season. The following year, he was traded to the Mets on June 12, where, although he was again largely used out of the bullpen, he registered the last two complete games of his MLB career. The season also produced Hendley's only above-.500 record, as he won five of eight decisions.\n\nIn his seven-season MLB career, Hendley won 48 games and lost 52, with a 3.97 ERA in 216 games, 126 of them starts. He struck out 522 batters and allowed 329 bases on balls and 864 hits in 879 innings pitched. He notched 25 complete games, six shutouts and 13 saves. He pitched at Triple-A for the Mets in 1968 and 1969 before leaving baseball. After retiring from the game, he went on to coach in his hometown of Macon at two high schools, posting winning records at each.\n\n"}

The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that loss will be recoverable where the extent of possible harm is so great that a reasonable man would guard against it (even if the chance of the loss occurring was very small).\n\n\"Wagon Mound (No. 2)\" should not be confused with the previous case of the \"Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd\" or \"Wagon Mound (No. 1)\", which introduced remoteness as a rule of causation to limit compensatory damages.\n\nOverseas Tankship chartered a freighter ship named the \"Wagon Mound\" which was taking on bunker oil at a dock. The engineers on the Wagon Mound were careless and a large quantity of oil overflowed onto the surface of the water. After several hours the oil drifted and was around two ships owned by the Miller Steamship Co that were being repaired nearby. Sparks from the welders caused the leaked oil to ignite destroying all three ships.\n\nAt the trial in the Supreme Court of NSW, Walsh J found that (1) that the officers of the \"Wagon Mound\" would regard the oil as very difficult, but not impossible, to ignite on water (2) ignition of the oil on waters had very rarely happened, and (3) it was a possibility that would only eventuate in very exceptional circumstances. Walsh J held that Overseas Tankship were not liable for negligence, but that the large quantity of oil was a public nuisance and the Overseas Tankship were liable to pay damages for nuisance.\n\nOverseas Tankship obtained leave to appeal directly to the Privy Council on the verdict of nuisance and the Miller Steamship Co obtained leave to appeal on the verdict of negligence.\n\nThe Privy Council upheld both the appeal and the cross-appeal. They held that it was not sufficient that the damage to by the Miller Steamship vessels was the direct result of the nuisance if that damage was unforeseeable. In relation to negligence the Privy Council held that a reasonable person in the position of the ship's engineer would have been aware of the risk of fire. Since the gravity of the potential damage from fire was so great there was no excuse for allowing the oil to be discharged even if the probability or risk of fire was low. A reasonable person, the Council held, would only neglect a risk of such a potentially great magnitude if he or she had a reason to do so, e.g. if it were cost prohibitive. Lord Reid said at 718-719,\n\nThe words \"real risk\" are the requirement of remoteness of damage but the test of foreseeability does not depend upon the actual risk of occurrence. The test is really whether the engineer ought to have foreseen the outbreak of fire, i.e. the type of consequence ought to have been foreseen.\n\nThis idea of a balance between magnitude and seriousness of risk is similar to that proposed by Learned Hand in \"United States v. Carroll Towing Co.\" 159 F.2d 169 (2d Cir. 1947) on the subject of legal causation. Such a formulation of the issue has struck some in the field as an argument along the lines typically made in the Law & Economics camp usually seen to be represented by the American Judge Richard Posner.\n\nThe holding in this case was harshly criticized for its \"overloading of the foreseeability concept\" by renowned torts scholar Leon A. Green.\n\n"}

He was pressed into the Royal Navy, and eventually became a warrant officer of the \"Bellerophon\". On 23 August 1784 Hindmarsh (senior) married Mrs Mary Roxburgh, a widow, at St George's-in-the East, Middlesex. At the time of the Battle of the Nile, Hindmarsh (senior) was the gunner of the \"Bellerophon\", (This was a warrant officer position.)\n\nHindmarsh was John and Mary Hindmarsh's eldest son, and was baptised on 25 May 1785 at St Mary's Church, Chatham, Kent.\n\nHindmarsh joined the Royal Navy either in April 1793 (aged seven or eight), or on 19 July 1790 (aged five).

He saw action on the \"Bellerophon\" at the Battle of the Glorious First of June in 1794 and the Battle of the Nile in 1798.\n\nHe was promoted to First Class Volunteer, when he was nine, for his actions at the Battle of the Glorious First of June.\n\nDuring the Battle of the Nile on 1 August 1798, the fire on board the French line-of-battle ship \"l'Orient\" put the \"Bellerophon\" (1786) in danger; all the other officers on the quarterdeck on the \"Bellerophon\" were killed or wounded, so 13-year-old Midshipman Hindmarsh gathered some of the crew, cut the anchor cables, and raised a spritsail to get the ship moving. Captain Darby then came on deck from having his wounds dressed. Nelson knew of this incident and referred to it five years later when he gave Hindmarsh his promotion to lieutenant on 1 August 1803 on board the \"Victory\". Hindmarsh suffered a contusion during the Battle of the Nile that resulted in him later losing an eye.\n\nHindmarsh transferred to the in May 1800, and took part in the Battle of Algeciras Bay in 1801. He served on at the Battle of Trafalgar, and was first lieutenant of the sloop , which took a conspicuous part in the Battle of the Basque Roads in 1809, and on the same sloop in the Walcheren expedition later in the year. He served in the in the invasion of Java in 1811. He was promoted to commander on 15 June 1814. A lengthy period of inaction on half-pay followed, but from March 1830 to December 1831 he commanded the , and was promoted to captain on 3 September 1831.\n\nWilliam Light captained the paddle steamer the \"Nile\" from London to Alexandria to join the Egyptian Navy in 1834, reaching Alexandria in September. Hindmarsh, who had prepared the steamer for delivery at Blackwall Yard on the River Thames, travelled as a passenger on the ship on its journey to Alexandria, and was made captain of the ship by November.\n\nHe received his commission as governor and commander-in-chief of the province of South Australia on 14 July 1836 . On 11 July 1836 Hindmarsh sailed for South Australia on HMS \"Buffalo\" as its first governor after winning influential support and applying to the Colonial Office.\n\nWhen the Naval General Service Medal, designed by William Wyon, was introduced in 1847, it was discovered that only two people were entitled to the medal with seven clasps (one clasp for each battle the recipient took part in): Sir John Hindmarsh and Admiral of the Fleet Sir James Alexander Gordon. The seven clasps on Hindmarsh's medal were for Java, Basque Roads 1809, Trafalgar, Gut of Gibraltar 12 July 1801 (the Second Battle of Algeciras), Nile, 17 June 1795 (known as Cornwallis's Retreat) and 1 June 1794 (the \"Glorious First of June\"). He was listed to be awarded a good service pension of £150 under the 1850-51 \"Navy Estimates\". He was promoted to rear admiral on the retired list in 1856.\n\n\"Bluff Jack Hindmarsh\", as he came to be known, arrived in Holdfast Bay on 28 December 1836, in the \"Buffalo\". Prior to this, earlier arrivals included the Survey Brig , (carrying Colonel William Light's surveyors), , and . Initially they landed on Kangaroo Island, and sent out the team of surveyors led by Light to find a suitable place for the capital city of the new colony. Hindmarsh wanted it at Port Lincoln, instead of at the present site which had been selected by Light.\n\nLight eventually chose the site of Adelaide, and stationed the \"Cygnet\" at Port Lincoln to notify Hindmarsh that the capital would be located on the east Coast of Gulf St Vincent near Holdfast Bay, now known as Glenelg, South Australia (named after Lord Glenelg, the then Colonial Secretary). (Through Lord Glenelg the name derives from Glenelg, Highland (previously Inverness-shire), Scotland.) The name Adelaide was chosen by King William IV in honour of his consort Queen Adelaide. Hindmarsh's proclamation on 28 December 1836 announced the commencement of colonial government and stated that Aborigines were to be treated justly and were 'equally entitled to the privileges of British subjects'. Although most South Australians have been taught that Hindmarsh's proclamation created the colony, it did not. William IV, having been empowered by an Act of Parliament in August 1834, in February 1836 Letters Patent 'Erected and Established' the Province of South Australia. No governor had the power to create colonies.\n\nThere was some question as to the respective powers of the Governor and the Resident Commissioner, James Hurtle Fisher, and the two came into open conflict. Feeling ran high and when Hindmarsh went so far as to suspend Robert Gouger and other public officers, the commissioners brought the matter before the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Hindmarsh was then recalled to London in 1838. In 1840 he was made Lieutenant-Governor of Heligoland, where he served until 7 March 1857. Hindmarsh was knighted by Queen Victoria on 7 August 1851, and retired in 1857 to the seaside town of Hove, England.\n\nIssued at Glenelg on December 28, 1836:\n\nHindmarsh lived at 30 Albany Villas in Hove for a number of years, where there is now a blue plaque in his honour. Rear-Admiral Sir John Hindmarsh died in London on 29 July 1860 and is buried in the grounds of St Andrew's Church, Hove.\n\nJohn Hindmarsh (1785 – 29 July 1860) married Susanna Wilson Edmeades (1786 – 2 April 1859), daughter of Henry Dickson Edmeades, on 4 November 1809 at St Nicholas' Church, Strood, Kent. Their children were:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1904816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904816", "title": "Canon AE-1", "text": "Canon AE-1\n\nThe Canon AE-1 is a 35 mm single-lens reflex (SLR) film camera for use with interchangeable lenses. It was manufactured by Canon Camera K. K. (today Canon Incorporated) in Japan from April 1976 to 1984. It uses an electronically controlled, electromagnet horizontal cloth focal plane shutter, with a speed range of 2 to 1/1000 second plus Bulb and flash X-sync of 1/60 second. The camera body is 87 mm tall, 141 mm wide, and 48 mm deep; it weighs 590 g. Most are black with chrome trim, but some are all black.\n\nThe AE-1 is a historically significant SLR, both because it was the first microprocessor-equipped SLR and because of its sales: backed by a major advertising campaign, the AE-1 sold over one million units, which made it an unprecedented success in the SLR market.\n\nThe AE-1 has a Canon FD breech-lock lens mount and accepts any FD or New FD (FDn) lens. It is not compatible with Canon's later Canon EF lens mount, though adapters made by independent manufacturers can be found. The camera will also accept Canon's earlier FL-mount lenses through the use of stop-down metering. Original FD lenses, introduced in 1971, do not rotate in the mounting process; instead, a locking ring at the base is turned to attach the lens. This was often criticized as being slower than the bayonet mounts of competing cameras. The counter argument, though, was that as the lens/body mating surfaces did not rotate, there was no wear that could affect the critical distance from lens to film plane. In 1979, Canon introduced the New FD series of lenses that rotate the whole \"outer\" lens barrel to lock. The inner lens barrel remains stationary, and thus the signal levers and pins still do not rotate. During the late 1970s, there were over 50 Canon FD lenses available for purchase. They ranged from a Fisheye FD 15 mm f/2.8 SSC to a FD 800 mm f/5.6 SSC, plus special purpose lenses such as a 7.5mm circular fisheye and a 35 mm tilt and shift lens.\n\nAccessories for the AE-1 include the Canon Winder A (motorized single frame film advance up to 2 frames per second), the Canon Databack A (sequential numbering or date stamping on the film), and the Canon Speedlite 155A (guide number 56/17 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) and Canon Speedlite 177A (guide number 83/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) electronic flashes. The later Power winder A2 is also compatible, but the Motor Drive MA is not.\n\nThe AE-1 is a battery-powered (one 4LR44 or 4SR44) microprocessor-controlled manual focus SLR. It supports either manual exposure control or shutter priority auto exposure. The exposure control system consists of a needle pointing along a vertical f-stop scale on the right side of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in light meter (center-weighted with a silicon photocell). The viewfinder used by the AE-1 is Canon's standard split image rangefinder with microprism collar focusing aids.\n\nThe AE-1 was the first in what became a complete overhaul of Canon's line of SLRs. The 1970s and 1980s were an era of intense competition between the major Japanese SLR brands: Canon, Nikon, Minolta, Pentax and Olympus. Between 1975 and 1985, there was a dramatic departure from heavy all-metal manual mechanical camera bodies to much more compact bodies with integrated circuit (IC) electronic automation. In addition, due to rapid advances in electronics, the brands leap-frogged each other with successively more automated models.\n\nAlthough Canon Camera K. K. had been making quality 35 mm cameras for decades, it had since the late 1950s been overshadowed by their rival Nippon Kokagu K. K. and their Nikon cameras. While Canons easily led in the amateur compact fixed-lens market (where Nikons did not compete), Canon SLRs didn't have the professional features of the top-end Nikon SLRs. Nikon, with its solid reputation for quality of material and workmanship, held a stranglehold on the prestigious professional SLR market that competitors could not break.\n\nThe AE-1 was the vanguard of the landmark Canon amateur level A-series SLRs and led Canon's charge into the emerging electronically controlled SLR market. The other members of the A-series were the AT-1 (released 1977), A-1 (1978), AV-1 (1979), AE-1 Program (1981) and AL-1 (1982). They all used the same compact aluminum alloy chassis, but with different feature levels and outer cosmetic plastic top panel. By sharing most major components, including an inexpensive horizontal cloth-curtain shutter, viewfinder information display, and autoflash control, Canon further reduced costs and could undercut the price of the more expensive SLRs then on the market.\n\nIn keeping with its cost-cutting philosophy, Canon designed the AE-1 to use a significant amount of structural plastic for a lighter and cheaper camera at the expense of being less impact resistant. Canon went to great effort to disguise the use of plastic - the injection-molded acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) for the top panel finished with either satin chrome (or black enameled) to give the look and feel of metal. The bottom plate were made of brass and then finished with satin chrome (or black enameled). Extensive use of electronics also allowed simpler modular internal construction instead of mechanical linkages. Five major and 25 minor internal modules reduced the individual parts count by over 300. Modular construction, in turn, allowed automated production lines in order to reduce cost. Unfortunately, cost concerns also resulted in the use of plastic in some of the moving/operating mechanisms.\n\nThe AE-1 was never designed to be a professional camera. However, it was made to have relatively straightforward controls and automatic aperture for newcomers, with various manual controls and system accessories to appeal to more experienced photographers. The AE-1 was the first SLR purchased by millions of amateur photographers, persuaded by its feature list and low price.\n\nIn many ways, the AE-1 represented the confluence of two streams of Canon camera development. The first generation electronically controlled 35 mm SLR Canon EF (1973) merged with the final generation rangefinder Canonet G-III QL17 (1972). After decades of chasing Nikon for Japanese optical supremacy, Canon finally hit upon a formula for success: high technology for ease of use, cheaper internal parts and electronics for lower price, and heavy advertising to get the message out. Despite outcries from traditionalist photographers who complained about an “excess” of automation ruining the art of photography, automation proved to be the only way to entice the amateur photographer.\n\nThe AE-1 had only one pointer needle used to indicate the light meter recommended f-stop, and neither a follower needle to indicate the actual lens set f-stop, nor plus/minus indicators for over/underexposure. The shutter-priority system of the AE-1 was more suited to sports action than to preserving depth-of-field, yet the 1/1000 s top speed of its horizontally traveling shutter limited its use for such activities. The battery door design was subject to frequent breakage, and over time owners have reported instances of shutter and mechanical gremlins, including mirror linkage wear (the \"Canon squeal\"). Canon's eventual abandonment of the FD lens mount for the EOS autofocus design also had an effect on prices for the AE-1 on the used market.\nApple sound designer Jim Reekes recorded the screen snapshot sound used on Macintosh computers and iPhones from the AE-1 he used as a high school student.\n\n"}
{"id": "1904819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904819", "title": "Meisburg", "text": "Meisburg\n\nMeisburg (in Eifel dialect: \"Mesbuasch\") is an \"Ortsgemeinde\" – a municipality belonging to a \"Verbandsgemeinde\", a kind of collective municipality – in the Vulkaneifel district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the \"Verbandsgemeinde\" of Daun, whose seat is in the like-named town. In Meisburg, a Moselle Franconian dialect is spoken.\n\nThe municipality lies on \"Bundesstraße\" 257 between Daun (19 km) and Bitburg (24 km) in the middle of the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth.\n\nThe German Volcano Route, which opened in September 2006, runs past the village.\n\nThe village sits in the valley of the Dümpelbach at a mean elevation of 480 m above sea level. The highest elevations in the area are the Daxelberg at 589 m above sea level and Rackenbach at 522 m above sea level. The Schafbach, which empties into the Lohsalm, rises in the Salmwald (forest), a water-rich area with a waterworks. From here, great parts of the Bernkastel-Wittlich district are supplied with drinking water.\n\nAll the following are Meisburg’s immediate neighbours:\nThe Eifel’s settlement history gives clues as to when the village of Meisburg might have arisen. Finds from the New Stone Age from about 4500 to 1800 BC and clues to Roman settlement about AD 300 in what is now Meisburg’s municipal area bear witness to human habitation here quite early on. The municipality owns a collection of Stone-Age stone hatchets, blades, scraping tools and arrowheads.\n\nFollowing the Celts were the Romans. The Roman road known as the \"Weinstraße\" (“Wine Road”) also came through the Meisburg area, running from Kirn in the Hunsrück by way of Wittlich, and then on the \"Rackenbacher Wies’chen\" (a “little meadow”) past nearby Meisburg to Prüm and Malmedy. The Rheinisches Landesmuseum Trier has confirmed an ancient settlement in the rural cadastral area “In der Delt” from the 2nd and 3rd centuries, presumably a Roman farm.\n\nThe Romans were driven out by Germanic tribes, and later in the course of the Migration Period came the Franks. In Meisburg, a Moselle Franconian dialect is still spoken today.\n\nAlthough the municipality marked 750 years of existence in 1979, but it is quite a bit older than that. Meisburg was first mentioned (as “Meisbreth”) in a document of Pope Innocent II in 1140 as property of the abbey Saint Maximin in Trier. The village probably existed around 1116, when the monks of Saint Maximin forged several charters, wherein Meisburg is mentioned as “Meisbrath”.\n\nIn 1229 Theoderich and his wife Clarissa, the Lord and Lady of Bruch, donated the patronage and two shares of the tithes at Meisburg to Saint Thomas’s Monastery. In 1330, a church was already listed in the village and Meisburg belonged to the Electoral-Trier \"Amt\" of Kyllburg. Saint Thomas’s Monastery was in the centuries that followed Meisburg’s landholder.\n\nWhen an end was put to the monastery’s landholding rights in 1794, the \"Amt\" of Kyllburg also ceased to be in force as the lands on the Rhine’s left bank were annexed by France. Under Napoleonic rule, Meisburg belonged to the Department of Sarre, and more locally to the canton of Prüm. At the Congress of Vienna in 1814 and 1815, this area was assigned to Prussia. The district of Daun was formed and Meisburg belonged to the \"Bürgermeisterei\" (“Mayoralty”) of Weidenbach, later being reassigned to the \"Bürgermeisterei\" of Niederstadtfeld. Since 1947, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate, and the former administration in Niederstadtfeld was absorbed into the \"Verbandsgemeinde\" of Daun.\n\nThe centralized water supply came to the village in 1920, and electricity in 1924. The provincial road, now known as \"Bundesstraße\" 257, between Daun and Kyllburg was built in the 1930s.\n\nThere is one ghost village near Meisburg, named Rackenbach, and there is also a vanished village, which was called Bradscheid.\n\nAs early as 1522, a mill was mentioned. The sawmill on the river Lohsalm is the only working, water-driven sawmill left in the Rhineland. About 2 km up the dale, the remnants of a further mill together with a millrace may still be found.\n\nThe Schafbrück, today a hotel, already existed in the 19th century. In the early 1950s, three outlying farms were established at Rackenbach and three more at Rascheid; all are still going concerns.\n\nA school was first mentioned in Meisburg in 1721. This was closed in the course of school reform in 1978. The Wallenborn primary school and the Niederstadtfeld Hauptschule are now the schools for the municipality. A Gymnasium and a Realschule are to be found in Daun and Gerolstein. The former school building in Meisburg now houses the kindergarten for Deudesfeld, Meisburg, Wallenborn and Weidenbach.\n\nThe council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\n\nMeisburg’s mayor is Dieter Klein, and his deputies are Johannes Görgen and Berthold Rieker.\n\nThe German blazon reads: \"Von silber über schwarz geteilt, oben das kurtrierische Kreuz, unten ein rot-silber geschachtelter Schrägrechtsbalken.\"\n\nThe municipality’s arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess argent a cross gules and sable a bend countercompony of the first and second.\n\nThe cross above the line of partition is Electoral Trier’s old armorial bearing and represents Meisburg’s allegiance to Trier in feudal times. The bend countercompony (that is, slanted stripe chequered in two rows) is the charge borne by the Cistercians. This stands for the village’s former landholder, Saint Thomas’s Monastery, which held Meisburg from 1229 to 1794.\n\nMeisburg fosters partnerships with the following places:\n\nSchoppen is a village within the municipality of Amel (or Amblève in French), and it lies in Belgium’s eastern German-speaking region.\n\nMeisburg has an old sawmill, which is driven by an overshot waterwheel seven metres in diameter. The \"Schneidemühle\" (“cutting mill”), as it is known locally, is the Rhineland’s, and the Eifel’s, last preserved sawmill. The energy needed to drive it is afforded by a 350 m-long millpond.\n\nNotable structures in Meisburg include the following:\n\nA significant portion of the local economy derives from the local American Spangdahlem Air Base.\n\n"}
{"id": "1904824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904824", "title": "New York State Route 199", "text": "New York State Route 199\n\nNew York State Route199 (NY199) is a state highway located in the Hudson Valley of the U.S. state of New York. Its western end is in Ulster County, where it begins as the continuation of the short U.S. Route 209 expressway east of its interchange with U.S. Route 9W; after crossing the Kingston–Rhinecliff Bridge over the Hudson River the rest of the highway crosses northern Dutchess County. As it does it passes through downtown Red Hook and Pine Plains, reaching its eastern end at U.S. Route 44 and State Route 22 southwest of Millerton in the upper Harlem Valley.\n\nThe portion of Route 199 east of its junction with the Taconic State Parkway was originally part of the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike, a toll road linking Bainbridge to Salisbury, Connecticut. This segment of the turnpike was incorporated into New York State Route41, a new route connecting Barrytown to Millerton, in the mid-1920s. NY41 was renumbered to 199 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.\n\nWhen the Kingston–Rhinecliff Bridge opened in 1957, NY199 was realigned to continue across the bridge to the town of Ulster. The former routing of the highway between Barrytown and NY 9G along Barrytown Road remained state maintained until 1980, when ownership and maintenance of the highway was transferred to Dutchess County. It is now designated as County Route82 (CR82).\n\nThe western terminus of Route 199 is the northern terminus of U.S. Route 209 in Ulster County. When the expressway section of the latter road reaches the cloverleaf interchange with US 9W, in the town of Ulster, between Kingston and Lake Katrine, it assumes the 199 designation as it continues eastward through woodlands. Veering slightly northward, it has another interchange with State Route 32 after a mile (1.6km), with the eastbound lanes reaching the toll booth for the Kingston–Rhinecliff Bridge further on.\n\nWest of the toll booth, the expressway ends as the road narrows to two lanes to cross the bridge, on an east-southeast heading. On the east bank, now in the Dutchess County town of Rhinebeck, it remains two lanes as it traverses wooded areas, part of the Hudson River Historic District, a National Historic Landmark. The road returns to a due-east course shortly after the crossing; it has its first traffic light at the intersection with River Road (also County Route 103).\n\nAt past that intersection, the highway reaches another traffic light at State Route 9G. It joins that highway northbound, immediately entering the town of Red Hook, for a two-mile (3.2km) stretch through woodlands, first heading northwest then due north. The two lanes widen to four on either side of the Rokeby Road intersection.\n\nThe 9G concurrency ends a mile to the north, where the roadway reaches another traffic light after a bend northeast. Here NY 199 turns east, going over a slight rise and then trending slightly southward towards the village of Red Hook. At the village line, a mile east of NY 9G, it passes Red Hook High School, the historic Maizefield estate, and the middle school, becoming West Market Street. At the center of town, another traffic light marks the intersection with U.S. Route 9.\n\nNY 199 becomes East Market Street and leaves the village approximately a half-mile (800m) to the east, curving gently through a mix of fields and woodlots in the surrounding landscape. A mile (1.6km) past the village, the road makes the first of four crossings of the Saw Kill. After crossing the Lakes Kill a thousand feet (300m) further on, the road starts a long turn southeastward past the former Sky Park Airport and Red Hook Golf Club.\n\nThe Saw Kill crosses again just north of the end of this section, at the small hamlet of Rock City, where the towns of Red Hook, Rhinebeck and Milan meet. State Route 308 has its eastern terminus here, and a signal over the third crossing of the Saw Kill regulates traffic as NY 199 makes the abrupt turn eastward again. A sculpture of an oversized fork marks this \"fork in the road\". The road and the Saw Kill parallel each other for another mile of rural landscape before the stream makes its final and uppermost crossing just past the Milan Hill Road (County Route 54) intersection on the north side.\n\nPast this point the highway bends southeast again, crossing Little Wappingers Creek, as the landscape becomes hillier and more wooded. A mile and a half further it resumes heading east, past Milan's town hall, to its interchange with the Taconic State Parkway, climbing slightly. East of the Taconic NY 199 crosses the small hamlet of Lafayetteville, turning to the north as it descends for a mile through a narrow, wooded valley to Wilbur Pond and Lafayetteville Multiple Use Area.\n\nFor the next two miles NY 199 continues to descend, turning northeast and entering the town of Pine Plains midway. After crossing Ham Brook, the highway turns north northeast for three-quarters of a mile (1.1km), bending back to the southeast around the side of an unnamed hill. The road returns to an east southeast heading as it descends another mile and the hills abruptly give way to more level ground on the outskirts of central Pine Plains, where NY 199 passes Stissing Mountain High School and becomes West Church Street, still trending south.\n\nAt the junction with Main Street in the center of town, the first traffic light since Rock City also marks where State Route 82 comes in from the south. It forms NY 199's other concurrency when it joins the highway heading eastbound. The joined roads continue together east southeast back into the countryside for the next mile and a half. Just past Pine Plains' town hall, at Hammertown, NY 82 turns north, towards the Columbia County hamlet of Ancram, ending the concurrency.\n\nFrom this intersection NY 199 turns northeast again briefly, then east, into a landscape of rolling hills, farms and woodlots. Three miles (5 km) of long curves in a generally eastward direction, climbing slightly, it reaches another small hamlet, Pulvers Corners, at an intersection with County Route 59. East of there, the road drops briefly into a swampy area, then climbs again as it turns southeast. At the North East town line, it reaches 1,000 feet (305m) above sea level, the highest elevation along its route. NY 199 continues southeast down a narrow valley for its last to its eastern terminus, at U.S. Route 44 and State Route 22 southwest of Millerton.\n\nOn April 2, 1802, the New York State Legislature created a turnpike corporation for the purpose of building a road—the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike—from the Susquehanna River in the vicinity of the town of Jericho (now Bainbridge) to the Connecticut state line at Salisbury. The portion of the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike east of the Hudson River was also commonly known as the \"Ulster and Salisbury Turnpike\" or just the \"Salisbury Turnpike\". The turnpike crossed the Hudson River from Kingston to Rhinecliff by way of the Kingston–Rhinecliff Ferry and used modern Rhinecliff Road and West Market Street to reach the village of Rhinebeck. East of Rhinebeck, the turnpike passed through the hamlets of Eighmyville, Milan, Lafayetteville, and Pine Plains and the village of Millerton on its way to the Connecticut border. The turnpike corporation operated through the late 19th century.\nIn the mid-1920s, the portion of the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike from Lafayetteville to modern NY 22 in North East was designated as part of NY 41, a new route extending from Barrytown, a riverside hamlet north of Rhinecliff, to North East by way of Red Hook, Lafayetteville, and Pine Plains. The designation lasted for only half a decade as NY 41 was renumbered to NY 199 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.\n\nInitial plans for the Kingston–Rhinecliff Bridge, a structure that replaced the ferry between the two locations, called for the bridge to span the Hudson River between downtown Kingston (at Kingston Point) and the village of Rhinebeck along a corridor similar to that of then-NY 308. Due to political and economic factors, the bridge site was moved upstream (northward). The partially completed bridge opened to traffic on February 2, 1957, as a realignment and extension of NY 199. The route left its original alignment east of Barrytown and followed NY 9G southward to the eastern bridge approach in the town of Rhinebeck. From there, NY 199 crossed the new bridge and ended at a junction with NY 32 just west of the Hudson River, then the western endpoint of the Kingston bridge approach. An extension of NY 199 west to US 9W was completed in the late 1950s; in 1964 the completion of the Catskill Expressway portion of U.S. Route 209 allowed more direct access from Route 199 and the bridge to the New York State Thruway.\n\nThe original routing of NY 199 from the Hudson River at Barrytown to NY 9G remained state-maintained as a reference route for just over two decades. On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of the highway, named Barrytown Road, was transferred from the state of New York to Dutchess County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. Barrytown Road is now designated as CR 82.\n\n\n"}

Additionally, MantisBT has integration with Twitter via a plugin, to allow a notification to be tweeted when an issue is resolved.\n\nVia MantisBT's event-driven plug-in system, it is possible to extend the built in notification support to run advanced scripts that perform additional notification actions (such as sending SMS messages or updating statuses in external project management systems).\n\nVersions of MantisBT prior to 1.2.0 allowed for limited integration with the CVS revision control system.\nWith the introduction of plug-in capabilities in MantisBT 1.2.0, revision control integration was redeveloped by John Reese in the SourceIntegration plugin.\n\nThe initial release of the SourceIntegration plugin supported GitHub, GitWeb, SourceForge and WebSVN.\nOver time, two additional modules were added and as of November 2013, source integration is supported for the following revision control tools and web-based providers:\n\nUpon committing changesets to a source code repository, post-commit hooks within Git or Subversion can be configured to automatically notify MantisBT that changes have been made to the repository. GitHub is also capable of remotely notifying a MantisBT installation of changes to a source code repository. Another technique used for integrating MantisBT with web-based source code hosting providers is the use of a job scheduler such as cron to manually check for changes to a repository every few minutes, reporting any changes back to MantisBT.\n\nSourceIntegration allows for issues within MantisBT to be automatically resolved when a changeset message contains special strings such as \"Fixes #12345\", which are configurable using regular expressions. This also allows for relationships to be automatically created between changesets and corresponding issues recorded in MantisBT. Multiple issue IDs can be specified in a single changeset message, although this is commonly discouraged as it indicates the changeset doesn't have a single, clear and logical purpose.\n\nIn addition to the features mentioned above, MantisBT also has support for:\n\nMantisBT is mainly written in PHP and uses SQL to interface with databases. The web-based user interface of MantisBT is written using HTML which is styled and presented using CSS. The UI also uses the jQuery client-side JavaScript library to provide optional features such as Ajax and JSON powered dynamic page content.\n\nDevelopment tools and build scripts are written predominantly in Python with some Shell script and PHP.\n\nMantisBT's codebase dates back to a time when PHP's support for object-oriented programming principles was in its infancy. \nAs of version 1.2.0, the majority of the MantisBT codebase still uses procedural programming principles, however some sections have been converted to make use of PHP 5's new object model.\n\nData is stored in a relational database management system by means of the ADOdb database abstraction library. MantisBT supports MySQL. Support for other databases ( PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL, Oracle ) is known to be problematic. The development team are looking to fix this for the 2.0 release.\n\nMantisBT maintains a database upgrade path between versions by modifying the database schema incrementally. During the installation of MantisBT, database schema modifications are replayed all the way back from early versions of MantisBT to reach the latest state.\n\nMantisBT requires a configured web server, the PHP programming language interpreter and a relational database management system supported by MantisBT and ADOdb.\n\nThe stable branch of MantisBT (version numbers within 1.2.x) requires PHP 5.1.0 or later. For the development branch (1.3.x), the minimum PHP version is 5.3.2.\n\nSeveral PHP extensions are required to enable specific functionality or for performance reasons; the extension for the RDBMS being used (i.e. \"mysqli\") is mandatory.\n\nMantisBT bundles a number of dependencies with each release including:\n\nFor drawing graphs of relationships between issues, GraphViz is required. MantisBT also has an alternative dependency upon the commercial JpGraph graphics library for plotting of statistics.\n\n"}

It is the district seat and also the seat of the \"\" of Daun.\n\nThe town lies in the , a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Daun lies south of the High Eifel on the river Lieser. Found from 2.5 to 3.5 km southeast of Daun’s town centre are the Dauner \"Maare\", a group of three volcanic lakes separated almost wholly by only the walls of tuff between them. The town is home to the \". Daun is furthermore a spa town and has mineral water springs.\n\nThe district seat of Daun has 8,514 inhabitants (as of 31 December 2005, counting only those with their main residence in the town). Besides the main town, also called Daun (4,264 inhabitants), the municipal area also includes these outlying centres (\") that were formerly self-administering municipalities:\n\nThe first settlement in the area came as early as the 7th century BC by which time the Celts had settled the fortified basalt mountain in Daun. The Romans, too, used this prominent hill in the Lieser valley as a watch post, as witnessed by Roman finds. The placename may have come from the Celtic-Roman word \"Dunum\", meaning either “fence” or “fortified heights”, that is to say, a fort.\n\nIn the late 10th century, a castle complex belonging to the free Lords of Daun arose here. In 1075, Daun had its first documentary mention in a townsman named \"Adalbero de Duna\".\n\nIn 1163, the free lords’ family died out. One of the family’s ministeriales, \"Richardus de Duna\", took over his former Lord’s name and even the coat of arms with the Daun fretting. In 1337, Daun is mentioned for the first time as being a town. In 1346 came a grant of town rights along with market rights, and Daun became at the same time the location of a high court.\n\nIn 1712, the Electoral-Trier ' was built by the Elector of Trier and Archbishop Karl-Josef on the Burgberg (\"Castle Mountain\"). After a transitory occupation by the French beginning in 1794, the village passed in 1815 to the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1817, Daun became seat of the district and an ' mayoralty, and also at the same time a district administrator’s seat. Since 1947, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Beginning in 1951, Daun could once more call itself a town.\nOn 15 May 1895, Daun was linked to the German railway network with the ' (Cross Eifel Railway). On 1 December 1909, a further railway line, the ' to Wittlich came into service. All public rail transport, however, ended in Daun more than a decade ago, although a two-hourly daytime service for tourists has been running in the summertime since 2005 on part of the '.

May 2014, and the mayor as chairman.\n\nDaun’s mayor is Martin Robrecht, and his three deputies are Friedhelm Marder, Manfred Krag and Hans-Dieter Wilhelm.\n\nThe town’s arms might be described thus: \"Or fretty gules\".\n\nThe arms now borne by the town are the ones once borne by the Lords of Daun, and date from the 13th century. When the Lords died out, the town passed to the Electorate of Trier, thus explaining the Cross of Trier that appeared in seals dating from the 16th and following centuries. The current arms, however, are the Lords’ original ones.\n\nThe Armorial Wijnbergen, dating from c. 1270 - c. 1285, includes Ferry II of Daun, lord of Oberstein (blazon: \"Argent fretty sable\").\n\nDaun fosters partnerships with the following places:\n\n\nA maar is a broad-low relief volcanic crater often filled with rainwater.

Thomas Edison was an inventor who accumulated 512 patents worldwide for his inventions. 1,093 of Edison's patents were in the United States, but other patents were approved in countries around the globe.\n\nEdison is credited for contributing to various inventions, including the phonograph, the kinetoscope, the dictaphone, the electric lamp (in particular the incandescent light bulb), and the autographic printer. He also greatly improved the telephone by inventing the carbon microphone. Most of these inventions were not completely original but improvements of earlier inventions. However, one of Edison's major innovations was the first industrial research and development lab, which was built in Menlo Park and West Orange.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, Edison was the world's most prolific inventor. At the beginning of the century, he held 736 U.S. patents. His final count was 1,093 U.S. patents, including 1084 utility patents (patents for inventions) and 9 artistic design patents. It was not until June 17, 2003 that he was passed by Japanese inventor Shunpei Yamazaki. Yamazaki was subsequently passed by Australian inventor Kia Silverbrook on February 26, 2008.\n\nThe first hundred patents mainly deal with the telegraph system. John Kruesi was the shop manager beginning in 1872. Kruesi built models, instruments, and apparatus for Edison's work.\nJohn Ott worked with Edison throughout his career. Ott was Edison's main model and instrument maker. Charles Batchelor was a superintendent for Edison toward the end of this series of patents. \n\n\nIn the second hundred patents, Edison continues his work with the telegraph. He also starts to patent electrical distribution and the light. \n\n\nThe next series of patents Edison received was mainly for the electrical distribution of power and the electric light. In 1883, Edward H. Johnson, a business associate of Edison, persuaded Frank J. Sprague to work for Edison. One of Sprague's significant contributions to the Edison Laboratory was the introduction of mathematical methods.\n\n\n\nThis period includes patents for electrical distribution circuits and methods as well as patents for the ore refining business Edison was embarking on. He also continued to patent improvements in telegraphy, phonography, and lighting. Arthur Edwin Kennelly contributed to a variety of Edison's endeavors undertaken to create a unique product or service from 1887 to 1893. \n\n\nThis series of patents mainly focus on the phonograph, telegraphy, telephone, and electrical generation and distribution.\n\n\nThis series of patents contain patents for the phonograph, lamps, telephone, dynamo systems, motors, and locomotives.\n\n\nAround these patents issuances, Thomas Armat joined Edison and sold him the patents to the machine known as the Vitascope.\n\n\nToward the end of this series of patents, Ott was the superintendent of experimenters for Edison.\n\n\nThis series of patents focus mainly on the phonograph and other talking-machines. There are several battery patents included in this portion of legal protections.\n\n\nEdison obtained a few design patents for the unique appearance and concept of items, giving Edison an industrial design right. His design patents are for phonograph cabinets and light bulbs with substantial decorative features.\n\n\n\nPatent offices\n"}

It is 35 kilometres west of London.\n\nStrathroy-Caradoc is a primarily rural municipality. Industries include turkey and chicken hatching and processing, corn, tobacco, automotive, and pharmaceutical. Some industrial products are manufactured in Strathroy, the township's largest locality and its commercial, cultural and industrial centre. Strathroy's hatcheries have seen it referred to as the turkey capital of Canada and even the world.\n\nSettlements within Strathroy-Caradoc largely grew up around the Sydenham River and the southwestern Ontario railways. Three major railway lines pass through the municipality: the CN (Canadian National Railway) Chatham Subdivision (connecting Windsor and London, Ontario), the CP (Canadian Pacific Railway) Windsor Subdivision (also connecting Windsor and London), and the CN Strathroy Subdivision (connecting London and Sarnia, Ontario).\n\nMunicipally, Strathroy-Caradoc is within Middlesex County. At the federal and provincial levels of government it is represented by the riding of Lambton—Kent—Middlesex. It is part of the London census metropolitan area.\n\nStrathroy-Caradoc's two largest communities are Strathroy and Mount Brydges. The township also contains the smaller communities of Cairngorm, Campbellvale, Caradoc, Christina, Falconbridge, Glen Oak, Longwood, Melbourne (part) and Muncey.\n\nStrathroy is 35 kilometres west of the City of London, Ontario, and is the largest community in Middlesex County outside London. The community is situated next to Highway 402 between London and the border to Port Huron, Michigan, U.S. at Sarnia, Ontario. Strathroy's economy is diverse, and major industries include automotive manufacturing, agriculture and food processing. The township's administrative offices are located in Strathroy.\n\nMount Brydges has a small commercial \"downtown\" featuring mostly local businesses and shops. Local agriculture includes maize, tobacco and wheat. The soil composition of the region is largely sandy (a phenomenon referred to locally as the \"Caradoc Sand Plains\") as a result of deposits created on the bottom of the glacial Lake Whittlesey which covered the area approximately 13,000 years ago.\n\nThe village came into existence as a result of the construction of the western division of the Great Western Railroad from City of London, Ontario to Windsor, Ontario, at the point where it crossed the existing road from Delaware, Ontario to Strathroy. This crossing happened to be at the point of greatest elevation on this division, the railroad having just climbed out of the valley of the Thames River from London. The station was named for Charles John Brydges the Managing Director of the Grand Trunk Railway from 1861 to 1874. The earlier name Carradoc, was replaced in 1856.\n\nStrathroy was first settled in 1832 by John Stewart Buchanan, accompanied by the explorer Sir Michael Jacques, at a location on the Sydenham River with flow and fall sufficient to power a . A general store opened in the settlement in 1840. Strathroy was incorporated as a village in 1860 and became a town in 1872 under the motto \"We Advance\". Buchanan named the settlement after his hometown of Strathroy in Ireland, now a suburb of Omagh in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland.\n\nIn 1866, \"The Age\" newspaper was established to compete with the already-established Western Dispatch newspaper. The \"Western Dispatch\" was purchased by \"The Age\" in 1923, which later became \"The Age Dispatch\". The newspaper is still published weekly.\n\nFrom 1867 to 1945 the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School operated in Muncey.\n\nSir Arthur Currie, who would later become the commander of Canadian forces in Europe during World War I, was born here on December 5, 1875.\n\nIn the fall of 1876, Bixel Brewery opened in Strathroy, producing lager beer for a century before its closing. Other breweries in the town have included the \"Western Steam Brewery\", \"Strathroy Brewing and Malting\" and \"West End Brewery\".\n\nIn 1896, the Strathroy Furniture Company opened its doors, and was renowned for nearly a century for making residential furniture. On July 15, 1992, the company declared bankruptcy and a liquidation sale was held in October 1992.\n\nOn February 14, 1914, the first patients were admitted to what would become Strathroy Middlesex General Hospital. At the time, the hospital was municipally-owned. The current building opened on June 23, 1962 as a two-story structure with 82 beds. The hospital was the location at which Native Canadian Dudley George succumbed to the gunshot wound he suffered at the Ipperwash Standoff at nearby Ipperwash Provincial Park on September 7, 1995.\n\nOn January 13, 1954, West Middlesex Memorial Arena opened in Strathroy. To commemorate the occasion, the NHL's Montreal Canadiens played an exhibition game at the arena, defeating the local Junior 'B' team the Strathroy Rockets 14–3 in front of 3,100 spectators.\n\nIn 2001, Strathroy merged with the former township of Caradoc to created the town of Strathroy-Caradoc.\n\nOn March 22, 2004, the town's 117-year-old train station was destroyed by a fire that took more than 35 firefighters to get under control. Adolescent boys were charged with starting the fire.\n\nIn 2005, Strathroy was connected to the Lake Huron Water Pipeline. This ended the town's existing reliance on groundwater and wells.\n\nOn August 10, 2016 an Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant supporter from Strathroy, Aaron Driver, was killed in a taxi outside his home, after being shot by Royal Canadian Mounted Police and detonating one of two homemade bombs. The taxi driver was injured.

It was introduced in 1981 as the successor to the Canon AE-1, five years after that camera's introduction. The major difference was the addition of the Program AE mode first seen in the A-1. This mode sets both the shutter speed and aperture automatically—albeit with a slight bias towards the shutter speed setting. The user focuses the camera and then presses the shutter button. For those desiring more control, the AE-1's shutter priority auto-exposure and full manual modes are still available.\n\nLike the A-1, the AE-1 Program has a right-hand \"action grip\" on the front of the camera. It also supports the A-1's Motor Drive MA; this requires another electrical contact on the base plate. The AE-1's Power Winder A, and a new, faster Power Winder A2, are also supported. The viewfinder uses LEDs to show information to the user.\n\nAlso like the A-1, the AE-1 Program supports interchangeable focusing screens. Unlike the A-1, though, which specifies that screens should only be changed by the factory or by experienced service technicians, those on the AE-1 Program can be changed by the user. The camera came standard with the new split/microprism screen, but seven others were available. Unfortunately, the AE-1 Program retains the older A-series type electromagnet-controlled cloth-curtain shutter that limits top shutter speed to 1/1000 of a second, together with a rather slow flash sync speed of 1/60 second. In the years since the AE-1 Program was introduced, this shutter design has also proven to be more maintenance-intensive than modern vertical-travel metal blade designs. The camera's electronics and electromagnets are powered by one 4SR44, PX28A, A544, K28A, V34PX, 4LR44, or L544 alkaline batteries.\nThe focusing screen on the AE-1 Program is brighter than any previous focusing screen on any Canon manual focus camera, allowing the user to focus with greater ease with \"slow\" lenses (up to f/5.6). It is the same focusing screen design that is used in the newest model of the top-of-the-line Canon F-1 (known as the New F-1).\n\nThe additional electronics used for the program features of the AE-1P have resulted in more electronic gremlins over the years, and the model is considered by some more difficult to repair than earlier and simpler A-series cameras. In its day, however, the AE-1 Program's automated features and simple controls helped introduce many new consumers to the SLR camera.\n\n\n"}

He was twice named as the District Defensive Player of the Year, and as a senior, he was a Texas Class 5A All-State first-team selection. His Ball High jersey number (No. 63) was retired at a dinner and parade on April 6, 2009. Hampton is the only football player in school history to receive such an honor.\n\nIn track & field, Hampton was one of the state's top performers in the throwing events. He had top throws of 16.13 meters in the shot put and 48.08 meters in the discus throw.\n\nHampton attended the University of Texas, and started 37 consecutive games for the Texas Longhorns football team between 1997 and 2000.

In his freshman season, he also had three quarterback pressures and a forced fumble. Hampton majored in history.\n\nIn 2000, \"The Daily Texan\", the student daily paper at Texas, characterized Hampton as \"relentless,\" even quoting Hampton. \"The way I see it, you never know when your last play is going to be,\" Texas' star defensive tackle said. \"So you should go hard all the time. There's no reason to take a play off..\" At the time, Hampton was 6'1 and 325 lbs and safety Greg Brown said \"I have never seen him take a down off, he's just so intent on destroying people that he never takes time to rest. It's gotta be a gift.\" Hampton played with Shaun Rogers, a 2nd round pick of the Detroit Lions in 2001 and a Longhorn from 1997–2000; and after Hampton was quoted saying \"No one guy can block me. Two guys can probably get it done but never one guy. I can always overpower one,\" \"the Daily Texan\" printed this: \"He's says he's never even been caked. Ever,\" fellow defensive tackle Rogers said. \"He says he wasn't even caked in junior high, but I, at least, am humble enough to say that I might have been once or twice. So I'd say some of what he says is questionable.\"\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers selected Hampton in the first round (19th overall) of the 2001 NFL Draft.

{"id": "1904879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904879", "title": "Spec Miata", "text": "Spec Miata\n\nSpec Miata is a class of racing car used in Sports Car Club of America (SCCA), National Auto Sport Association (NASA), and Midwestern Council of Sports Car Clubs (MCSCC) road racing events.\n\nThe Spec Miata (SM) class is intended to provide the opportunity to compete in low-cost cars with limited modifications, suitable for racing competition. It is intended to encourage low cost, entry level, production car based competition. Spec Miata currently races both sprints and enduros where available.\n\nMazda MX-5s (also known as Mazda Miata Roadsters) in model years 1990 through 1993 with 1600 cc engines, model years 1994 through 1997 with 1800 cc engines, and model years 1999 through 2005 with 1800 cc engines have been approved by the SCCA for Regional racing in all divisions of the SCCA. The class was approved for National SCCA racing beginning in the 2006 racing season. At the professional level, the SM cars are known as the Global MX-5 Cup.\n\nSpec Miata was first approved as a Regional class in the Southwest Division of SCCA in 1999 and the first race as an official class was at the Fiesta Carrera Regional, Texas World Speedway 2.90 road course on July 24, 1999 at 1:05 pm and included a starting field of 4 drivers: Tim Evans, Shannon McMasters, Bob Reinhardt and David Obeney finishing in that order.\n\nThe first Spec Miata race for the National Auto Sport Association was held in February 2000 by the NorCal Region. At the national level, the \"UPR Racing Supply First Ever Spec Miata National\" was held in Avondale, Arizona at Phoenix International Raceway's infield road course on January 13, 2006 with Brad Rampelberg as the \"First Ever\" National race winner.\nResults of the 1st SCCA National Qualifying Race may be googled at: azscca 2006 National Double Double. \nMike Helpin a local highly respected racer was awarded the 1st place trophy because Brad Rampelberg was disqualified for an undisclosed reason. Brads disqualification was later overturned by a SCCA board. Brad Rampelberg was named winner in later posted results. (may be seen at the above azscca website)\nAs its name shows, Spec Miata is a \"specified\" class. This means that the rules for allowable modifications to the car are very strict. The class intends to put drivers on a very even footing by making their cars as identical as possible. The rules are far more conservative than the Improved Touring category, but provide equivalent safety measures.\n\nBecause of the support of Mazda through Mazdaspeed, the wide availability of the car on the used market, plentiful and inexpensive parts, and the simplicity of maintenance on the cars, Spec Miata has become a very popular class. Also adding to the appeal is the fact that A Spec Miata can be raced in both SM and ITA/ITS in SCCA Regional Competition. A typical race-ready spec miata can be purchased on the market for $8000–$35,000 depending on race win history and specific modifications. A new MX-5 Cup (professional class) based on the ND series MX-5 costs $58,900 new, and champions of the national series can win over $200,000 to advance up the motorsport ladder.\n\nIn August 2019, Mazda Motorsports and Winding Road Racing announced Spec MX-5, a racing class structure based around the MX-5 NC that is designed to be an affordable, tech-able, reliable and fun-to-drive option for club racers. Race cars in the division will feature Roush Performance cylinder heads, Penske Racing shocks, Eibach springs and sway bars, Pagid brake pads, Toyo tires, and more, and will have a curb weight of . Spec MX-5 will have select events starting in 2020.\n\nThis section is not an exhaustive set of rules; it is intended to give the reader an idea of the preparation level of the cars in this class.\n\nSpec Miatas used a specific Bilstein shock with an adjustable coil-over suspension with Eibach springs and adjustable front and rear sway bars. Beginning in 2019 the Bilstein shock is being phased out in favor of a Penske Shock. Top mounts are different but otherwise the new setup retains the coilover sleeve and spring from the previous Bilstein setup.\n\nDepending on the Club, Toyo or Hoosier tires are specified. For SCCA SM, the Hoosier SM7 is the dry tire and H20 is the Wet Tire. For NASA, the Toyo RR is the Dry Tire and RA-1 is the Wet Tire. (205/50R15) is the spec tire size. Hoosier Tires will provide the spec tire for all National SCCA Events. The wheel size is fixed at 15x7, with the wheels weighing no less than 13 pounds.\n\nCars with 1.6 liter engines (1990-1993) have a race weight of 2275 pounds (1057 kg) and first generation cars with a 1.8 liter displacement engine (1994-1997) have a minimum race weight of 2400 pounds. \"NB1 Miatas\" (1999-00) have a minimum weight of 2400 pounds. \"NB2 Miatas (2001-2005) have a minimum weight of 2425. Overbore engines are a 15 lb addition.\n\nThe 1.8 liter displacement cars may not run an aftermarket air intake and NB models must run a throttle restrictor, while the 1.6 liter displacement cars do not require a restrictor, may run a modified air box, and may remove the driver corner light. The class calls for \"Stock\" engines with some modifications allowed in the name of balancing factory tolerances. Engine Builders have been taking advantage of this for years, and \"Top Prep\" engines make 10-20 horsepower more than a healthy stock engine and cost several thousand dollars. The full rules for the class may be found in the current Spec Miata Category Specifications of the SCCA rule book, called the GCR (General Competition Rules & Specifications).\n\n\n2019 Jim Drago \n\n\"General Competition Rules and Specifications\", 2006, Sports Car Club of America.\n\n"}
{"id": "1904881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904881", "title": "Bank of Estonia", "text": "Bank of Estonia\n\nThe Bank of Estonia () is the central bank of Estonia as well as a member of the Eurosystem organisation of euro area central banks.\n\nThe Bank of Estonia also belongs to the European System of Central Banks. Until 2010, the bank issued the former Estonian currency, the kroon.\n\nThe Governor of the Bank of Estonia, currently Ardo Hansson, is a member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank.\n\nPrior to the introduction of the euro, TALIBOR or the Tallinn Interbank Offered Rate was a daily reference rate based on the interest rates at which banks offer to lend \"unsecured\" funds to other banks in the Estonian wholesale money market (or interbank market in Estonian kroons. TALIBOR was published daily by the Bank of Estonia, together with TALIBID (Tallinn Interbank Bid Rate).\n\nTALIBOR was calculated based on the quotes for different maturities provided by reference banks at about 11.00 am each business day by disregarding highest and lowest quotation and calculating arithmetic mean of the quotations.\n\nThe bank was established on 24 February 1919 by the provisional government of Estonia following the independence of Estonia. Two years later, Eesti Pank became a national bank and responsible for issuing the Estonian mark.\n\nA new version of the Statutes was approved in 1927, according to which Eesti Pank became an independent note-issuing central bank with limited functions. The main tasks of the bank remained to guarantee the value of the money through currency circulation and through the arrangement and regulation of short-term credit volume. Through the sale of government securities, the bank became a true joint-stock bank.\n\nA foreign loan of GBP 1.35 million (27.6 million kroon) supplemented the foreign currency reserves, of which Eesti Pank received GBP 1 million. The gold and foreign currency reserves of the State Treasury were also transferred to the central bank. The fixed capital of the bank was increased from 2.5 million kroon to 5 million kroon. The sizes of the issues in relation to the reserves backing the kroon were determined. Long-term loans that had become illiquid were transferred to the Long Term Loan Bank, founded specifically for the purpose of releasing Eesti Pank from this burden. Upon the Soviet invasion of 1940, Eesti Pank was nationalized as \"the Estonian Republican Office of the State Bank of the Soviet Union\". With the nationalization and the introduction of the Russian ruble as legal tender, it lost much of its functions.\n\nEesti Pank recommenced operations on 1 January 1990 after an interval of 50 years, though not yet as the central bank of an independent country. The fact that it was possible to restore the central bank in spite of the fact that Estonia was not yet independent was a paradox of that time. The Statutes of Eesti Pank were confirmed in March 1990, and 400 million rubles were allocated for the statutory fund. According to the Statutes, Eesti Pank was an independent public organisation, an issue centre subordinate to the highest authority of the ESSR. The main tasks of the bank included the following: \n\nEesti Pank took over the Tallinn branch of the Foreign Trade Bank of the Soviet Union, re-organising it into the Foreign Currency Operations Centre of Eesti Pank. The central bank also attempted to take other steps within its ability for the liberalisation of the economy and in order to make the transition to a market economy: it began organising currency auctions, publishing quotations of the number of rubles in circulation, issuing licenses for foreign payments and settlements, etc.\n\nAt the same time it was necessary to begin transforming Eesti Pank into an actual regulator of the Estonian banking sector. At that time, settlements were performed through Moscow, the local Clearing Centre being subordinate to Moscow. In the first years, Eesti Pank was not yet able to regulate and inspect the operations of the local commercial banks.\n\nThe formation of reserves backing the kroon was commenced. After the recognition of Eesti Pank as the legal successor of the central bank of the Republic of Estonia, established in 1919 during the independence period, the government of Great Britain decided to return the gold that had belonged to the pre-war Eesti Pank to Estonia. The restoration of the membership of Eesti Pank in the Bank for International Settlements was accompanied by the restoration of its rights to the gold and other assets deposited there. Reserve felling areas from the State Forest Fund worth 150 million dollars were also included in the balance sheet of Eesti Pank as an additional foreign currency reserve (although the latter had more a moral and an emotional value for the general public than a practical one).\n\nThe new banknotes (the \"second\" kroon) reached Estonia in April 1992. The Estonian kroon was pegged to the German Deutschmark to ensure stability. The German Bundesbank was informed of this. The Estonian kroon was declared the sole legal tender in circulation and Eesti Pank the only regulator of monetary relations in Estonia. Within three days, 1500 rubles were exchanged to krooni for each resident natural person at the rate of 1 kroon = 10 rubles. Almost the entire amount of rubles in circulation in Estonia was exchanged to kroons at the same rate (deposits, money held by enterprises, etc.). The rate was considered under-priced by many opponents, but it actually corresponded to the market rate of that time. Time and the later course of events have indisputably proven the correctness of the choice made. All the laws and other legal acts planned for the beginning of the monetary reform came into effect. Eesti Pank began to publish daily exchange rates of the Estonian kroon against the most important foreign currencies.\n\nWith the introduction of the euro on 1 January 2011, the Bank of Estonia became a member of the Eurosystem or the system of Eurozone central banks that of that collectively set and implement the zone's monetary policy. Some of the functions of the bank were taken over by the European Central Bank. Other functions, as well as membership to the European System of Central Banks remained.\n\n\n\n"}

Its capital was Jiangdu Municipality () (modern Yangzhou in Jiangsu Province).\n\nSome historians consider Wu to have begun in 902, when Yang Xingmi was named Prince of Wu by the Tang dynasty. All three rulers of Wu after 907 (when the Tang dynasty collapsed) were Yang Xingmi's sons. The first ruler Yang Wo was murdered by Xu Wen and Zhang Hao, and his two brothers after him were effectively puppets dominated by Xu Wen at first, and later Xu Wen's adopted son Xu Zhigao (Li Bian) who in 937 usurped power to establish Southern Tang. Yang Pu, the last ruler, was the only one to claim the title of Emperor; the other rulers were kings or princes.\n\nThe founder of Wu, Yang Xingmi, started his career as a volunteer soldier before seizing power in his home prefecture Luzhou in a military coup. The weak Tang court could only confirm his position. In 887 the governor of Huainan, Gao Pian, was captured by Bi Shiduo. Xingmi defeated Shiduo and captured the provincial capital Yangzhou later that year, but by then Pian had been put to death by Shiduo. Another rebel leader, Sun Ru had Shiduo killed and absorbed his forces. Yang Xingmi was forced to abandon Yangzhou and retreat to Luzhou. With Luzhou as his base, Xingmi increased his power by seizing neighbouring prefectures until he could recapture Yangzhou in 892. For this act, the Tang court granted him the military governorship of Huainan.\n\nWhile still nominally loyal to the Tang dynasty, rival warlords were now carving out their own statelets. Yang Xingmi clashed with Zhu Wen of Later Liang in the north and Qian Liu of Wuyue in the south, successfully defending his territory. In 902 Yang Xingmi was named Prince of Wu by Emperor Zhaozong of Tang.\n\nYang Xingmi died in 905 and was succeeded by his oldest son Yang Wo. In 907 Zhu Wen forced the last Tang emperor to abdicate and proclaimed himself the first emperor of the Later Liang. Yang Wo refused to acknowledge this change and continued the use of the last era name of Tang. From this point Wu was an independent, sovereign entity.\n\nYoung and untested at his father's death Yang Wo had relied on the director of the guard, Xu Wen, for his ascension, but later grew to resent Xu Wen's influence. However, before he could pull himself free, Yang Wo was assassinated by Xu Wen and his colleague Zhang Hao in 908. Wen and Hao had initially planned to divide Wu between themselves and submit to Liang, but they soon fell out. Xu Wen installed Yang Wo's younger brother Longyan and had Zhang Hao killed. Yang Longyan was a mere puppet with Xu Wen as the state's true ruler. Wen made himself Runzhou governor and moved his command to Jinling. The regular administration at the capital was left to his son Xu Zhixun. After Zhixun's murder in 918, this position was inherited by Wen's stepson, Zhigao. In 919, Yang Longyan proclaimed himself King of Wu and inaugurated a new era name, thus for the first time Wu officially claimed to be a sovereign state. Longyan died of illness in 922 and was succeeded by his brother, Xingmi's fourth son, Yang Pu. As before, Xu Wen had the real power. He prodded Yang Pu to proclaim himself emperor, but died in 927 before this could happen. 29 November 927 Yang Pu acceded the throne as Emperor of Wu. Xu Zhigao was made grand marshal and director of the Chancellery.\n\nThe Wu capital was at Guangling (present-day Yangzhou), and held present-day central and southern Anhui, central and southern Jiangsu, much of Jiangxi, and eastern Hubei.\n\nXu Zhigao had been adopted by Xu Wen on Yang Xingmi's insistence and soon proved himself an able man. He came to power in Wu after his stepfather's death in 927 and continued to rule the state as governor of Jinling for some time. Finally in 937 he formally seized power for himself by proclaiming himself King of Qi and Yang Pu abdicated after suppressing the opposition of Yang Meng. Two years later, by claiming descent from a Tang prince Xu Zhigao and restoring his surname of Li, Xu Zhigao became Li Bian and proclaimed the restoration of the Tang. His state would be known to history as the Southern Tang.\n\n\n – Wu emperors; – Southern Tang emperors \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1904897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904897", "title": "Special edition", "text": "Special edition\n\nThe terms special edition, limited edition, and variants such as deluxe edition, or collector's edition, are used as a marketing incentive for various kinds of products, originally published products related to the arts, such as books, prints, video games or recorded music and films, but now including clothing, cars, fine wine, and whisky, among other products. A limited edition is restricted in the number of copies produced, although in fact the number may be very low or very high. Suzuki (2008) defines limited edition products as those “sold in a state that makes them difficult to obtain because of companies limiting their availability to a certain period, quantity, region, or channel\". A special edition implies there is extra material of some kind included. The term is frequently used on DVD film releases, often when the so-called \"special\" edition is actually the only version released.\n\nCollector's edition may just be another term for special edition and limited edition products that include additional features or items that regular versions do not have. Speaking about books, collector's edition products may refer to books in special limited and numbered editions, sometimes hand-bound, and signed by the artist and containing one or more original works or prints produced directly from their work and printed under their supervision. Whatever these extra features or items are, they must represent additional value to collectors of these products.\n\nPopular culture widely employs \"Special, Deluxe, Expanded\" and \"Limited Edition\" in marketing, releasing subsequent, improved versions of film DVDs, music, and video games. Companies widely use special editions and incremental improvements to sell the same products to consumers multiple times. This has been seen in the \"10th Anniversary edition\" of \"Titanic\", which simply consists of the first two discs of the previous \"Special Collector's edition\", only with new packaging, and on CD with the \"30 Year Anniversary Edition\" of Bob Marley's \"Exodus\", which has exactly the same content as the original album, but in new packaging.\n\nIn many cases, successful film releases have had items made in limited numbers. These \"limited editions\" usually contain the best DVD edition possible of a film with special items in a box set, sometimes containing items available only in the limited edition. Items marked thus are often (but not always) released for a shorter time and in lower quantity than common editions, often with a running number (e.g. \"13055 of 20000\") printed on the products to boost the rarity feel, as the company implies not to manufacture more. It is also common to have such items packaged with unique designs.\n\nWith the success of DVDs, special editions of films themselves (instead of just special editions of film DVDs) have also become fairly common. Sharing similarities with the concept of a director's cut (another long-suffering inflation-by-marketing term). These generally feature additional in-movie material. The material may be footage originally deleted from the final cut, or new digitally-created, interpolated content. Unlike true director's cuts, the directors may not have had part in such projects, such as in \"\", in which Richard Donner did not help create the new version, just supply the material. The \"Doctor Who\" television movie \"The Five Doctors\" was edited, recut, amongst various other changes, to make the \"Special Edition\" in 1999 for the first DVD release of the episode.\n\nLimited edition prints, also known as LEs, have been standard in printmaking from the nineteenth century onwards. A limit to the print run is crucial, as many traditional printmaking techniques can only produce a limited number of best quality impressions. This can be as few as ten or twenty for a technique like drypoint, but more commonly would be in the low hundreds - print runs of over a thousand are regarded as dubious by the serious art market for original prints, even though with many techniques there is no loss of quality.\n\nEdition sizes higher than about 500 are likely to be of print reproductions of paintings, of much less value, though some modern techniques blur this traditional distinction. As in other fields, the use of the concept has become largely driven by marketing imperatives, and has been misused in parts of the market. In particular, lithographic, photogravure, rotogravure, and giclee reproductions of prints, derived from photographs of an original print, which are most unlikely to have any investment value, are often issued in limited editions implying that they will have such value. These need to be distinguished from the original artist's print, carefully produced directly from his work, and printed under the artist's supervision.\n\nIn UK and New Zealand the Fine Art Trade Guild ensures the quality and verification of limited edition prints by employing a number of strictly administered regulations for all processes and aspects related to them.\n\nIn the United States limited editions are regulated under state consumer protections laws. California became the first state to regulate the sale of limited edition art prints with the \"California Print Law\" of 1971. The state of Illinois later expanded on the California statute. However, it was not until 1986 that more comprehensive provisions, still in place today, were enacted with the passage of the \"Georgia Print Law\". That law became the template for statutes subsequently enacted by other states. The Georgia Print Law written by (former) State Representative Chesley V. Morton, became effective July 1, 1986. The law requires art dealers, artists, or auctioneers to supply information to perspective purchasers about the nature of the print, the number of prints and editions (including HC editions) produced, and the involvement (if any) of the artist in the creation of the print. The penalty for violation of the law ranges from simple reimbursement to treble damages, in the case of a willful violation. Those found to be in violation of the law are also liable for court costs, expenses, and attorney fees. The law applies to works of art valued at more than $100.00 (not including frame). Charitable organizations are specifically exempt from the provision of the law. The statute of limitations is one year after discovery, and, if discovery of the violation is not made within three years of the sale, then the purchaser's remedies are extinguished.\n\nA limited edition is normally hand signed and numbered by the artist, typically in pencil, in the form (e.g.): 14/100. The first number is the number of the print itself. The second number is the number of overall prints the artist will print of that image. The lower the second number is, the more valuable and collectible the limited editions are likely to be, within whatever their price range is. A small number of \"artists' proofs\" may also be produced as well, signed and with \"AP\", \"proof\", etc. Prints that are given to someone or are for some reason unsuitable for sale are marked \"H. C.\" or \"H/C\", meaning \"hors de commerce\", not for sale.\n\nIn terms of musical albums, the term \"deluxe edition\" refers to a re-release of an album, generally a sufficient period after the initial release, featuring extra content related to the album. From the 2000s it has become commonplace for a deluxe edition to be released at the same time as the standard edition. The deluxe edition often includes some or all of the following: extra tracks; demo recordings of album tracks; live recordings of album tracks; alternate takes, mixes, or edits of album tracks; B-sides from album singles that did not appear on the album; DVD content, including music videos. These editions are commonly repackaged, with the new content on a second disc and many feature additional liner notes.\n\nAlso, some albums are initially released in two editions, a regular retail version and a \"special\" or \"limited\" version in distinctive packaging and often including extras such as a second disc, a video DVD, or liner notes expanded into a hardback book. Generally, the special package is only produced for the first pressing or a set number of copies - some are limited to only being sold at one chain of retailers. It is important to distinguish this from an expanded re-release, since those are generally available widely and for a long period of time.\n\nMilking, or \"double-dipping\", refers to the practice of releasing multiple editions of the same product (usually a CD, DVD, Blu-ray Disc), simultaneously or at different times, with the purpose of enticing consumers to buy more than one edition. This can be done with, for example, a special edition, a director's cut, an ultimate edition, and a collector's edition, sometimes with different features or supplementary material.\n\nThe consumer may be persuaded to purchase multiple editions, with the belief that the additional features or content will be worth paying for a product that is largely equivalent to one already owned.\n\n"}

{"id": "1904912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904912", "title": "KNTV", "text": "KNTV\n\nKNTV, virtual channel 11 (VHF digital channel 13), branded on-air as NBC Bay Area, is an NBC owned-and-operated television station licensed to San Jose, California, United States and serving the San Francisco Bay Area. The station is owned by the NBC Owned Television Stations subsidiary of NBCUniversal (itself a subsidiary of Comcast), as part of a duopoly with Telemundo owned-and-operated station KSTS (channel 48), also licensed to San Jose; it is also sister to regional sports networks NBC Sports Bay Area and NBC Sports California. KNTV and KSTS share studios on North 1st Street in the North San Jose Innovation District; KNTV's transmitter is located on San Bruno Mountain.\n\nKNTV is available on Comcast Xfinity cable systems in the Bay Area on channel 3 (703 in HD).\n\nKNTV signed on the air on September 12, 1955, originally operating as an independent station covering the entire north-central California coast from Monterey to San Francisco. It was the first television station in San Jose, and was originally operated by Standard Radio and Television Corporation, which was owned by Allen T. Gilliland. The station's studios and offices were located at 645 Park Avenue, a short distance from the Caltrain railroad tracks and adjacent to the Gilliland-owned Sunlite Baking Company in downtown San Jose. Its antenna was originally located on Loma Prieta, some south of San Francisco. Channel 11 often aired shows from CBS, DuMont and NBC that were respectively turned down by San Francisco's KPIX-TV (channel 5) and KRON-TV (channel 4), as well as some ABC shows that also aired on KGO-TV (channel 7). The station was not viable as an independent, despite the Bay Area's size. The going got even more difficult when Oakland-based KTVU (channel 2) signed on in 1958, and it soon became apparent that the Bay Area was not large enough at the time to support two independent stations.\n\nHowever, due to KNTV's transmitter and antenna location, its signal could be received fairly well in the nearby areas of Monterey and Salinas; the transmitter was located approximately halfway between San Jose and Monterey. Taking advantage of this, KNTV sought and was granted the ABC affiliation for the Monterey Bay area in 1960, on the condition that the station reduced its transmitter power so as not to overlap with network-owned KGO-TV's signal. Previously, all three networks had been shoehorned onto Salinas-based KSBW-TV (channel 8). KNTV, therefore, became one of the few stations located outside the market it served.\n\nFollowing the death of Allen T. Gilliland in 1960, ownership of KNTV was held by the executors of his estate, which included son Allen T. Gilliland Jr. The younger Gilliland acquired majority ownership in August 1966 and later operated it as part of Gill Industries, which also controlled San Jose's cable television system. Even as an ABC affiliate, KNTV occasionally preempted a few ABC programs. KGO-TV, meanwhile (as a network-owned outlet) aired ABC's entire programming schedule, so this often gave San Jose and Silicon Valley (also known as the \"South Bay\") area residents a second choice for viewing preempted ABC programming (although reception of KGO in the South Bay tended to have some static without a roof-mounted antenna, because of the relatively far distance from Sutro Tower). KNTV was highly regarded locally by viewers and seen as a \"hometown\" station for the South Bay, with news coverage and local commercials reflecting its South Bay roots, rather than focusing almost solely on San Francisco as the other network outlets did. Gill Industries sold KNTV to Norfolk, Virginia-based Landmark Communications in 1978. Twelve years later, Landmark sold the station to a minority-owned firm, Granite Broadcasting.\n\nIn 1999, KGO-TV agreed to pay Granite a substantial fee to stop channel 11 from running ABC programming once the station's affiliation contract expired. ABC's corporate parent, The Walt Disney Company, saw the need to expand KGO-TV's exclusive advertising market share into San Jose for this reason, and it felt that KNTV was taking away from the share.\n\nThat same year, the deYoung family, owners of KRON-TV and the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", put all of its media properties up for sale. NBC, which had been in the midst of renewing its affiliation agreement with KRON-TV, jumped into the bidding. It had been one of the bidders for the channel 4 license in the late 1940s when it wanted a sister television station to complement West Coast flagship KNBC (AM 680, now KNBR), but lost out to Chronicle. The deYoungs had built KRON into one of NBC's strongest affiliates, though NBC had long felt chagrin at KRON's frequent preemptions of network programming. NBC was thought to be the favorite to buy KRON-TV, but in a move that shocked the broadcasting industry, lost a bidding war for the station to Young Broadcasting in November 1999. NBC responded by threatening to yank its programming from KRON unless Young agreed to run it under the conventions of an NBC-owned outlet, including disallowing the station from preempting NBC programs outside of breaking news coverage. The network also made the unprecedented demand that Young pay NBC $10 million annually to carry the network's programming—a form of reverse compensation. Young refused, and announced that it would end KRON-TV's 52-year relationship with NBC once its affiliation contract ended in December 2001.\n\nIn February 2000, Granite contacted NBC to negotiate an affiliation deal and offered to pay an average of $37 million annually (totaling roughly $362 million over 10 years) for the rights to broadcast NBC programs on KNTV. This agreement was groundbreaking and notable, as KNTV became the first major market affiliate to pay a network for programming, reversing a long-standing model where networks paid affiliates to carry their programming. NBC accepted the deal, which was due to take effect in January 2002. In preparation for this switch, KNTV boosted its signal to reach the entire Bay Area. This increased KNTV's potential audience to more than seven million viewers, including 90% of the Bay Area Metropolitan area.\n\nOn July 3, 2000, KNTV terminated its ABC affiliation after 40 years with the network; it then temporarily carried programming from The WB Television Network in a part-time simulcast with then co-owned KBWB-TV (channel 20, now KOFY-TV), which was the full-time WB affiliate for the Bay Area. The move cost the Monterey Bay area an over-the-air ABC affiliate. In order to compensate for the loss, KGO-TV was then added on cable providers in that market, with certain syndicated programs carried by the station replaced due to syndication exclusivity rules. This did not pose as much of a problem as it may seem due to the very high penetration of cable and satellite in the Monterey Bay area. ABC would not return over-the-air to the area until KSBW began carrying ABC programming on the station's second digital subchannel on April 18, 2011.\n\nIn September 2000, Nielsen Media Research reclassified KNTV to the Bay Area DMA. In March 2001, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) officially recognized KNTV as a Bay Area station, clearing the way for channel 11 to begin identifying as \"San Jose/San Francisco/Oakland.\"\n\nFor Granite Broadcasting, the deal with NBC was expensive; the company showed a net loss of $44 million for the first three quarters of 2001, more than double its losses during the same period the previous year. In an attempt to reduce debts, Granite started looking for a buyer for Detroit WB affiliate WDWB (now WMYD) in October 2001; that station would not be sold until 2014.\n\nOn December 17, 2001, NBC announced another twist on the deal: it bought KNTV from cash-strapped Granite for $230 million, effectively separating itself from KBWB (which remained under Granite ownership; it was sold in 2018). The network was already in the process of acquiring San Jose-based Telemundo station KSTS, and wanted to create a duopoly in the Bay Area. KNTV officially joined NBC at 11:35 p.m. Pacific Time on December 31, 2001. Jay Leno officially welcomed NBC's newest station in a ceremony on \"The Tonight Show\" (leading an area-wide 10-second countdown, as the show served as KNTV's first NBC program), followed later that morning by a segment on the \"Today\" show in which Al Roker introduced KNTV's anchors. With NBC's move to channel 11, it became the only major network in the Bay Area to switch from one station to another. KNTV is the third Bay Area station to affiliate with NBC, as primary CBS affiliate KPIX-TV had carried the network as a secondary affiliation upon its sign-on in 1948 until KRON debuted the following year. NBC formally took control of KNTV in April 2002. This was not NBC's first attempt at purchasing a station in the Bay Area; a plan to purchase KTVU in 1961 was cancelled following antitrust objections from KRON-TV, along with an FCC hearing designation surrounding all applications related to NBC's ownership of radio and television stations in Philadelphia.\nAfter the affiliation switch to NBC, KNTV changed its branding to \"NBC 3\" to reflect its position on cable channel 3 on nearly every cable provider in the Bay Area. However, due to potential confusion with Sacramento's NBC affiliate, KCRA-TV (which broadcast on channel 3), NBC rebranded the station as \"NBC11\" in September 2002. Initially, KNTV newscasts were perceived to be infotainment due to the focus on crime and entertainment news, but by late 2002 the newscasts began focusing on Bay Area affairs. The station added on a San Francisco bureau and studio in a facility on Battery Street in San Francisco.\n\nDuring the 2004 Summer Olympics, the station heavily promoted channel 11 through its \"illuminating\" marketing campaign (stylized as \"I11uminating,\" with the number \"11\" used in place of the \"L\" letters). Even in its early years as the new NBC affiliate, KNTV aired NBC's soap opera lineup much later in the afternoon than most affiliates; KRON had done this for years as an NBC affiliate. Soon enough by August 2004, KNTV fell in line with the network's recommended time slot and now airs \"Days of Our Lives\" (NBC's remaining afternoon daytime drama) at the recommended 1 p.m. timeslot.\n\nIn 2004, NBC converted a vacant office space in northern San Jose into a state-of-the-art, all-digital facility for KNTV and KSTS. On December 13 of that year, KNTV moved from its original studios on Park Avenue to the new location. As part of a company-wide environmental initiative (known today as \"Green is Universal\"), the facility is entirely powered by wind energy. Following its acquisition by NBC, KNTV continued to broadcast from its longtime transmitter location on the summit of Loma Prieta (located between San Jose and Santa Cruz), but did not increase its power to improve signal coverage in San Francisco and Oakland; as a result, the signal could not be seen over the air in much of the Bay Area north of San Mateo County, including much of San Francisco itself. The affiliation and market switches also resulted in many cable providers in the Monterey Bay area either dropping KNTV entirely or blocking its NBC programming under syndication exclusivity guidelines; even so, the signal still overlapped with KSBW.\n\nThat all changed on September 12, 2005, when KNTV was able to finally move its transmitter northwest to San Bruno Mountain, giving it a signal comparable to the Bay Area's other major stations. The move came after years of objection from KRON's owner Young Broadcasting. KRON made numerous filings with the FCC, alleging that thousands of San Jose residents would lose over-the-air coverage of KNTV if it moved closer to San Francisco.\n\nSome San Francisco residents, especially in the Sunset and Richmond districts of the city, still found it difficult to receive an adequate over-the-air signal, because they are shielded from San Bruno Mountain. Most of the other Bay Area stations operate from Sutro Tower, which has a better overall view of San Francisco proper, although at the expense of those in northern San Mateo County, where San Bruno Mountain acts as a shield. However, most of the Bay Area is covered with a strong signal from all of the stations. The year closed, however, with a devastating wildfire at the retired transmitting facility on Loma Prieta. The fire was quickly extinguished on the afternoon of December 31; however, the fire reignited after firefighters had left the scene, and destroyed the former primary analog and digital transmitters, which had only been retired a few months earlier and were in backup status, as well as a variety of other communications equipment.\n\nIn January 2007, CNBC moved its Silicon Valley bureau—formerly located at \"The Wall Street Journal\"s bureau in Palo Alto—into KNTV/KSTS' San Jose studios. Former KNTV and KRON reporter Jim Goldman is the bureau chief, and the main CNBC reporter covering business stories concerning the Silicon Valley; the set used for daily broadcasts on CNBC occupies part of KNTV's newsroom. In 2009, KNTV changed its on-air branding from \"NBC11\" to \"NBC Bay Area\"; additionally the station's website was relaunched on October 16 of that year, as part of a larger revamp of the Web sites of NBC's entire O&O station group.\n\nIn April 2010, KNTV entered into an arrangement with former NBC affiliate KRON-TV to broadcast network programs during instances in which KNTV has to preempt them for special programming such as telecasts of San Francisco Giants games. Incidentally, KRON's owner, Young Broadcasting discussed entering KRON into a shared services agreement with KNTV's owner NBCUniversal, which ultimately never materialized. KRON's default carriage of preempted NBC shows ended in 2012, when KICU-TV (then owned by Cox Enterprises as a sister station to KTVU) resumed those duties until the sale of both KICU and KTVU to Fox Television Stations in 2014; preemptions are now handled in-house with a move of NBC programming to KNTV's Cozi TV subchannel. On April 13, 2010, KNTV became the subject of Stephen Colbert's program, \"The Colbert Report\", where Colbert played a clip read by weekend anchor Diane Dwyer on the issue of \"unpaid internships\". Colbert would eventually use that given clip to set the stage for laughs based on unpaid interns.\n\nIn April 2014, a five-alarm fire destroyed the former KNTV complex on Park Avenue; the vacant property had been purchased by the San Jose Redevelopment Agency along with adjacent parcels in the (eventually ill-fated) hopes of attracting a new downtown stadium for the Oakland A's.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn December 20, 2012, KNTV began broadcasting Cozi TV, a digital subchannel network that airs a mix of movies, first-run lifestyle programming, and classic television series from the 1950s through the 1980s. The service is a retooling of NBC Nonstop (which operated a regional service called NBC California Nonstop that debuted in January 2011 on KNTV, and sister stations KNBC/Los Angeles and KNSD/San Diego), which carried news and lifestyle-oriented programs, some of which have been carried over to Cozi.\n\nKNTV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 12, using PSIP to display KNTV's virtual channel as 11 on digital television receivers. KNTV is now the largest NBC affiliate on the VHF band—and the only NBC O&O to broadcast on VHF.\n\nSyndicated programming on KNTV includes \"Access Hollywood\" (including its afternoon and expansion counterparts), \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\", \"Rachael Ray\", and \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" among others. The first four are distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution and \"Rachael Ray\" is distributed by CBS Television Distribution. KNTV is one of two NBC O&Os (alongside WBTS-CD in Boston) to carry \"Rachael Ray\" (sister station KXAS-TV in Dallas also aired the same program from September 2017 until September 2019).\n\nSince being purchased by NBCUniversal, KNTV has produced its own programs for both local broadcast and for distribution nationally on the NBC television network and in syndication. Two of KNTV's national and regional programs that are distributed to NBC stations are \"Tech Now!\" (a weekly show that debuted on September 19, 1998 under Granite Broadcasting ownership that covers the latest in technology and gadgets, and is hosted by Scott Budman and produced by Scott McGrew and was at one time popular in Ghana) and \"In Wine Country\" (a weekly series focusing on the Napa Valley wine community). KNTV is one of eight NBC O&O stations to distribute programs to other stations or to the network itself as of 2019, along with Los Angeles' KNBC, New York City's WNBC, Miami's WTVJ, Hartford's WVIT, Philadelphia's WCAU, Chicago's WMAQ-TV and Dallas' KXAS-TV. The station is also the local broadcaster of the San Jose Holiday Parade each December.\n\nOn October 12, 2010, KNTV hosted its first political debate since becoming owned by NBCUniversal. Its 5, 6, and 11 p.m. newscast was broadcast live at San Rafael's Dominican University of California, though the latter newscast were used as a wrap-up of the debate. The debate between California gubernatorial candidates Meg Whitman and Jerry Brown was moderated by NBC News special correspondent Tom Brokaw. This program was simulcast on several other NBC stations within California including fellow NBC O&Os KNBC and KNSD, as well as on Hearst Television-owned KCRA-TV and KSBW.\n\nOn November 1, 2007, KNTV entered into a three-year broadcast contract with the San Francisco Giants through 2010, replacing the team's longtime broadcaster KTVU, which had carried Giants games since 1961, three years after the team moved to the Bay Area and KTVU first began broadcasting. The team's first game broadcast on KNTV aired on April 1, 2008. KNTV broadcasts 20 to 40 Giants baseball games a year, which are produced by sister network NBC Sports Bay Area. In addition, KNTV airs \"Giants Clubhouse\" each weekend during the MLB season. All of the Giants broadcasts are carried in high definition. The station has preempted Giants telecasts during the Summer Olympics due to NBC currently holding the television rights to the Olympics. The Giants' contract with KNTV concluded at the end of the 2010 season, however, the broadcast rights were renewed prior to the 2011 season. Thus, it is one of the few major network affiliates that carry live local MLB games to viewers in their broadcast area. Despite this, it does not offer any live over-the-air broadcasts of the American League's Oakland Athletics, which are broadcast exclusively by NBC Sports California on cable.\n\nKNTV also occasionally runs special editions of its newscasts or \"Sports Sunday\", to cover San Francisco 49ers NFL games that are broadcast as part of \"NBC Sunday Night Football\". On January 23, 2014, NBCUniversal, Comcast, and the San Francisco 49ers announced a 10-year partnership that included new additions to Levi's Stadium. The partnership spans multiple business units that iinclude KNTV, NBC Sports Bay Area, its VoiceEdge, ethernet, and Xfinity services, as well as building a new studio only from where KNTV is based. It also produced 400 hours of programming on KNTV and NBC Sports Bay Area.\n\nBeginning in the 2018 season, KNTV serves as an over-the-air broadcaster for the San Jose Earthquakes Major League Soccer team; the station will air selected matches involving the team. Prior to this, the station promoted its in-field advertisements with its sister station KSTS during the home games at Avaya Stadium.\n\nCurrently, KNTV airs San Jose Sharks games shown via the \"NHL on NBC\"; this included the team's appearance in the 2016 Stanley Cup Final.\n\nKNTV presently broadcasts 34 hours, 55 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5 hours, 35 minutes each weekday and 3½ hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). The station also produces a local sports highlight and discussion program on Sunday nights called \"Sports Sunday\", which is hosted by sports reporter Laurence Scott—who is usually joined by guest co-hosts in-studio; a secondary program, \"Xfinity Sports Sunday Primetime\", is co-hosted by Jerry Rice and Nnamdi Asomugha during the fall, when NBC provides football coverage in prime time.\n\nIn September 1998, KNTV began producing an hour-long 10 p.m. newscast for then-WB affiliate KBWB-TV (now KOFY-TV). Upon becoming a WB affiliate in July 2000, KNTV increased its local news programming; it retained all of its existing newscasts and added two hours to its weekday morning newscast, an hour-long news and technology-focused program at noon, an additional half-hour to its 6 p.m. newscast and a simulcast of the KBWB 10 p.m. newscast. The 7–9 a.m., 6:30 and 10 p.m. newscasts were dropped once KNTV switched to NBC in January 2002.\nOn July 21, 2008, KNTV became the fourth station in the Bay Area (behind KGO and KTVU) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in widescreen—albeit in standard definition. For the first half of 2009, the recession forced NBC to cut costs at KNTV. Several rounds of layoffs occurred, forcing KNTV to shed some well-known personalities, including chief weather anchor John Farley, who left the station in March 2009; after Farley's departure, weekend weather segments originated from the studios of Los Angeles sister station KNBC. The station also closed news bureaus in Sacramento and Oakland. KNTV's news helicopter (which was purchased in 2006) was also suspended from use on April 30, 2009. On May 22, 2009, former NBC Weather Plus meteorologist Jeff Ranieri was named KNTV's new chief meteorologist. On June 29, 2009, layoffs continued with the firings of reporters Noelle Walker, Ethan Harp, Christien Kafton and San Jose reporter Daniel Garza, along with several behind-the-scenes jobs.\n\nIn December 2010, sports director Raj Mathai transitioned to weeknight news anchor, though he continued to host \"Sports Sunday\" for a short time after the change. On December 21, 2010, KNTV's newscasts moved to a temporary set while the main news set underwent renovations, traffic and sports reports were also done in the newsroom. Meteorologist Rob Mayeda also announced his move to the weekend evening newscast. The station added additional personnel including former KOB reporter Marla Tellez, meteorologist Nick O'Kelly, and freelance sports anchors Justin Allen and Christine Nubla (all of whom, except for Tellez, previously worked for KNTV).\n\nOn April 20, 2011, KNTV announced that Comcast SportsNet Bay Area (now NBC Sports Bay Area) would begin producing sports segments for the station starting on June 13, 2011, to be produced from a dedicated set at the cable channel's studios. This made KNTV the first NBC-owned station to have its sports segments produced by the regional sports network. On August 10, 2011, Janelle Wang replaced Jessica Aguirre as weeknight anchor of the 5 p.m. newscast. Wang and Raj Mathai are the only Asian American weekday anchor team outside of Hawaii.\n\nOn July 16, 2016, KNTV became the eighth NBC owned station and the first station in the West Coast to begin using \"Look N\" graphics following seven NBC-owned stations on the East Coast which began using the new graphics in the summer of 2016. Prior to this, KNTV along with sister stations KNBC and KNSD revamped their websites on July 1, 2016. As of January 2017, KNTV is the only NBC-owned station and one of the two stations in the Bay Area which do not have 4:00 p.m. newscasts since the NBC affiliation taken over from KRON-TV in 2002. Several owned stations already have hour-long 4:00 p.m. newscasts. The other NBC-owned stations in New York, Miami and Hartford began theirs in June, the stations in Los Angeles and Chicago revived theirs in the summer of 2016, and the station in Boston (then WBTS-LD) debuted theirs in January 2017.\n\nIn December 2018, the station announced that they would cut its midday newscasts to an half-hour beginning on January 7, 2019 in favor of the brand new lifestyle show \"California LIVE\"; sister stations KNBC (which produces the program) and KNSD also announced their cuts on the midday newscasts for an half-hour due to the launching of the series.\n\nFrom mid-March 2020 until April 17, 2020, KNTV expanded its 11:00 p.m. weeknight newscast to a full hour in order to provide expanded coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1904913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904913", "title": "Henri Chapron", "text": "Henri Chapron\n\nHenri Chapron (30 December 1886 - 14 May 1978) was a prominent French automobile coachbuilder. His atelier, created in 1919, was located in the Paris suburb of Levallois-Perret.\n\nChapron was born in Nouan-le-Fuzelier (Sologne), and began his career developing custom body designs for French luxury vehicles, like Talbot, Delage, and Delahaye, in the 1920s.\n\nFrance ceased building vehicles of this type in the 1950s, due to tax legislation that made luxury vehicles prohibitively expensive in France (see Tax horsepower#France). \n\nChapron switched his attention to the recently launched Citroën DS. At first, Chapron purchased these vehicles and customised them as one-off creations. Many of these became unique convertible variants. He soon supplied Citroën directly, distributing a \"Décapotable usine\" (factory convertible) through their worldwide dealership network - 1,365 cars in all.\n\nIn 1968, Chapron made a special extended DS Presidential model for the government of Charles de Gaulle. In 1972, Chapron delivered two SM Presidential models to the government of Georges Pompidou. These gigantic 4 door convertibles were first used for the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to France and continued in use through the inauguration of Jacques Chirac in 1995.\n\nHenri Chapron died in Paris in 1978, and the company itself survived for some time under the direction of his widow. Less than five months after Chapron's own death the company presented a Landaulet bodied conversion constructed for a rich Dutch customer, based on a lengthened Peugeot 604. There were hopes this might lead to a low but steady production of similar conversions, as had happened during with Chapron's lengthened specials based on the Citroën DS. That did not happen, but the company did produce some special luxury versions, with lavishly equipped interiors, of the Citroën CX. Operations finally ceased in 1985.\n\n\n"}

For males, the badge is worn as a decoration centered on the left uniform pocket, below standard awards and decorations. For females, it is worn on the right side, even with the bottom of their decorations.\n\nThe badge is derived from the emblem of the USAF Honor Guard that was created in 1976 by Malcolm Haynes. It is composed of crossed M1 Garand rifles with fixed bayonets silhouetted over a silver/gray Roman helmet adorned with a scarlet red horsehair festoon on a field of ultramarine blue with the attached organization motto. The Roman helmet is symbolic of the Praetorian Guard of the Roman Empire---the original Honor Guard of the Western World---whose duty it was to protect the reigning emperor. The red festoon denotes courage and valor. The silver/gray of the helmet proper represents the excellence expected of all USAF Honor Guard personnel. The crossed M1 rifles historically denote the unit's primary weapon (the M14 rifle became the unit's primary weapon in 2002; however the Honor Guard's Drill Team still continues to use the M1). The ultramarine blue background symbolizes the primary theater of Air Force operations - the sky and beyond. The attached motto, \"To Honor With Dignity\" best describes the unit's mission.\n\nSome slight differences are apparent between the badges worn by members of the USAF HG, and those members of the BHGs. The USAF HG badge features the words \"USAF HONOR GUARD\" below and \"TO HONOR WITH DIGNITY\" above the main insignia and is polished silver. The BHG badge features the words \"BASE HONOR GUARD\" above and \"TO HONOR WITH DIGNITY\" below the main insignia and is multi-colored.\n\nThe badge is worn only while actively assigned to the USAF HG or BHG; upon completion of the member's tour of duty it must be removed. Prior to the full implementation of the Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) on 1 November 2011, a subdued patch version of the BHG badge was sewn onto the old battle dress uniform; but since unit and duty patches are not worn on the ABU, both the USAF HG unit patch and BHG patch have been relegated to history.\n\n"}

He subsequently returned to practising criminal law.\n\nHe was Member of Parliament for Harlow in Essex from 1983. He served on the Health and Heritage Select committees and was a Parliamentary Private Secretary in the Northern Ireland Office and the Department of Environment. He introduced a number of Acts including the Sexual Offences Act, the Nurse Prescribing Act and the Video Recordings Act. Hayes lost his seat to Bill Rammell, the Labour Party candidate, in the 1997 general election.\n\nHayes was on the left on the Conservative Party, unlike most of the 1983 intake of Conservative MPs. Hayes opposed capital punishment and fought for free dental and eye check-ups. On his blog, Hayes wrote, \"I'm on the independent left of the Conservative Party. During the Thatcher years I was regarded as a rebel. Heaven knows why, I just believed in social justice and pragmatism. But in those days that was about as popular as a rat sandwich. On one occasion I reduced our majority from 140 to 4. I was not always popular with the right.\" Once, when asked why he did not support Blair's \"New Labour\" endeavour, he replied \"They're too right-wing\". On the BBC Question Time programme on 9 May 2013, he expressed the view that there was a real danger that the entire legal profession would be placed in the hands of G4S within a couple of years.\n\nRoth's Parliamentary Profiles says of Hayes: \"[He] has never taken himself seriously, and therefore has not been taken seriously by others.\" Betty Boothroyd, former Speaker of the House of Commons, said of Hayes that \"he would look very pretty as a French maid; I wish I had his curls.\" Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher personally disliked his beard and yellow ties, which he refused to change, when asked. Hayes was a regular contributor on television quiz shows and talk shows, in particular, \"The James Whale Show\". For over four years he regularly appeared with Charles Kennedy, Ken Livingstone and Michael Parkinson on a political discussion show on LBC in London. Hayes appeared on comedy show \"Have I Got News for You\" in 1992, on which he was unafraid to ridicule his own party and it was revealed that he is Ken Livingstone's \"favourite Tory\", which Hayes compared to being \"Ian Paisley's favourite Catholic\". Hayes was frequently described as a \"political buffoon\", because of his willingness to subject himself to ridicule on various television and radio appearances. This included being fastened in the stocks and pelted with custard pies, and being whipped while dressed in fetish clothing.\n\nWhen the heavy metal group Iron Maiden were having trouble getting permission to play in Beirut, Hayes threw his weight behind them (one member was a constituent). \"I have advised [the Foreign Office] the group is not a bad influence,\" he said. \"In fact they are very good: I have all their albums.\"\n\nFollowing his career in Parliament, he wrote for the magazine \"Punch\". In 2006, a bomb was found near his house in the village of Wendens Ambo, near Saffron Walden in Essex. In May 2010, Hayes started a political blog for the website \"Think Politics\", which also hosts blogs by former Liberal Democrat MP for Falmouth Camborne, Julia Goldsworthy, current Labour MP for Denton and Reddish, Andrew Gwynne, and Conservative candidate for Swansea West, René Kinzett. His blog has now moved to Total Politics. Hayes also regularly reviews the newspapers on Stephen Nolan's weekend late night show on Fridays at midnight on BBC Radio 5 Live along with Mohammed Shafiq, a media commentator on British-Muslim issues.\n\nHayes was called to the Bar by Middle Temple in 1977. Hayes has practised as lead defence counsel in high-profile cases, including \"R\" v \"McGing\" and \"R\" v \"Tishane Bernard\". McGing was a soldier in Basra accused of drowning a teenager whilst on patrol. He was acquitted. Tishane Bernard was accused of a gangland execution, and was also acquitted. He was instrumental in setting up Ten 17 radio with Tony Saxby and Russ Lewell in 1991. He acted as lawyer to John Hemming in his 2005 legal bid to challenge postal votes at the 2005 general election and has also defended celebrities and a British soldier in Iraq. Hayes also represented two Labour councillors accused of postal Ballot fraud in Birmingham. Hayes works at Goldsmith Chambers on whose website he is described as specialising in leading high-profile murder, drugs, rape and fraud cases. He discontinued the rape prosecution of Liam Allen in December 2017, after it was discovered that the police had withheld tens of thousands of text messages sent by the complainant.\n\nHayes is married to Alison and has two children, Lawrence and Francesca. He was the subject of a newspaper article in \"The Mirror\" on Jan 7th 1997 which 'outed' him as bisexual, having a long-term affair with another man, Paul Stone.

They are best known for their number-one R&B single \"Love Is Strange\" in 1957. \n\nBaker and Vanterpool began recording together in 1954. They first recorded as Mickey & Sylvia in 1955 on Rainbow Records before signing to Groove Records where they became the first big seller for the label. The duo later formed their own label, Willow Records. Although Mickey & Sylvia initially disbanded in 1958, they reunited in 1960 and continued to record together on an infrequent basis until 1965, when Baker moved to France.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, music instructor Mickey Baker was inspired by the success of husband-and-wife musical duo Les Paul & Mary Ford to form a duo with one of his pupils Sylvia Robinson. They released their first record together, \"Fine Love,\" as \"Little\" Sylvia Vanterpool with Mickey Baker and His Band on Cat Records in 1954. \n\nBaker and Vanterpool released their first record, \"I'm So Glad,\" as Mickey & Sylvia on Rainbow Records in 1955. They recorded for the RCA label subsidiary Groove Records in 1956. While sharing the bill with Bo Diddley at Howard Theatre in Washington, D.C., Vanterpool was inspired by his song \"Love Is Strange.\" With his blessing, Mickey & Sylvia recorded their own rendition. Their single was released in November 1956. It became their biggest hit, topping the US R&B chart and peaking at No. 11 in the US pop chart in January 1957. The record sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. \n\nIn 1957, Mickey & Sylvia recorded for Vik Records. They had two other singles chart in 1957 with \"There Oughta Be A Law\" and \"Dearest.\" In 1958, Mickey & Sylvia split up because Vanterpool wanted to pursue a solo career. Vanterpool married Joseph Robinson in 1959 and thereafter went by Sylvia Robinson. Baker replaced her with singer Kitty Noble. Mickey & Kitty released three records on Atlantic Records in 1959. Baker also released his debut solo album, \"The Wildest Guitar\", in 1959.\n\nAfter a two year hiatus, Mickey & Sylvia were reunited by Hugo & Luigi at RCA Victor in 1960. They also established a publishing company. In 1961, they formed their own label, Willow Records, distributed by King Records, which produced the singles \"Lovedrops\" and \"Baby You're So Fine.\" That year they contributed to Ike & Tina Turner's hit record \"It's Gonna Work Out Fine.\" Robinson produced the track and played guitar while Baker played the role of Ike Turner. The single earned Ike & Tina Turner their first Grammy Award nomination. Ike Turner wrote Mickey & Sylvia's song \"He Gave Me Everything,\" which was released as a B-side single to \"Since I Fell For You\" in 1962. \n\nA second studio recording of \"Love Is Strange\" in 1962 featured now-legendary drummer Bernard \"Pretty\" Purdie, on his first paid session gig. \n\nAfter the duo split, Baker recorded a successful instrumental solo album, \"The Wildest Guitar\". He moved to France in the 1960s, where he worked with various French musicians. Baker died at his home in Montastruc-la-Conseillère, France on November 27, 2012, at the age of 87.\n\nSylvia Robinson had a hit record in 1973 with \"Pillow Talk,\" and was subsequently a driving force in the creation of the Sugar Hill rap label. Robinson died in 2011, at the age of 76.\n\n\"Love Is Strange\" (in its 1956 version) was later featured in movies like \"Dirty Dancing\", \"Badlands\" and \"Casino\", and was covered many times (for instance, on Paul McCartney's third post-Beatles album \"Wild Life\"). The song became a UK hit by the Everly Brothers in 1965. Peaches & Herb had a hit with their rendition in 1967.\n\nIn 2004, \"Love Is Strange\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\n\n"}

His mother died when he was sixteen, prompting him to move to Ohio where he found a job with Firestone Tire. As part of the company's tuition reimbursement program, Wallace enrolled in the University of Akron, in Akron, Ohio, where he studied transportation, marketing and advertising. Upon graduation, Wallace moved to New York City in pursuit of his childhood dream of being a comedian. At first, success in comedy proved elusive and Wallace worked as a salesman for an advertising agency to pay the bills.\n\nWallace's break came when one of his clients opened a comedy club. The club owner was amused by Wallace's natural humor and friendly demeanor and offered him the chance to perform stand-up comedy. In 1977, Wallace walked on stage for the first time, wearing a preacher's robe and calling himself The Right Reverend Dr. George Wallace. His routine was completely improvised.\n\nHe stayed in New York City for several years, perfecting his craft and living with friend and fellow comedian Jerry Seinfeld.\n\nIn 1978, Wallace moved to the West Coast, where he quickly became recognized as a talented young comedian. After one of his performances, producers from \"The Redd Foxx Show\" asked him to write for the popular series.\n\nHowever, after only one year of writing, Wallace returned to the stage. He became a regular at The Comedy Store in West Hollywood, California, which also featured artists including Richard Pryor, Rodney Dangerfield, Roseanne Barr, Jay Leno and Robin Williams. Wallace also took his comedy show on the road, opening for George Benson, Diana Ross, Donna Summer and Smokey Robinson, among others.\n\nWallace, who was named the Best Male Standup Comedian during the 1995 American Comedy Awards, says that his routines are inspired by everyday moments of life. His unique brand of social commentary proved popular with radio audiences as well. Wallace was a regular on the \"Tom Joyner Morning Show\" before joining Isaac Hayes on a popular radio program on the former WRKS radio station in New York City. He also starred in his own HBO special and has appeared on many television shows, including \"The Tonight Show\", \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" and \"Late Night with David Letterman\".\n\nOn May 3, 2006, Wallace performed his most famous stand-up bit, which was a diatribe against the young generation's obsession with allowances with the oft-cited catchphrase of \"Get Your Mess Right.\" While Wallace often jokes about the flippancy of modern youth culture (often citing the \"dumb dumbs on their smart phones\") this one joke in particular resonated with his audience, and he repeats it at every show.\n\nIn December 2007, Wallace suffered an on-stage injury when he fell during a private-party performance at the Bellagio resort hotel and casino in Las Vegas. Wallace sued the Bellagio, claiming negligence after tripping over loose wires on stage. In April 2014, a Las Vegas jury found in favor of Wallace and awarded him US $1.3 million. After winning his case against the Bellagio, Wallace announced that he would end his 10-year run as a Las Vegas headliner to pursue other projects. \"There are so many things to do. It's time to get into something new.\"\n\nWallace has had political ambitions. In 2006, he considered running for mayor of the city of Las Vegas, Nevada. Wallace stated that as mayor, he would update the Las Vegas Strip, with an easy-to-use monorail, close the strip to vehicles, and expand the road system behind the Strip hotels.\n\nHe was the best man at comedian Jerry Seinfeld's wedding.\n\nWallace's nephew, Steve Wallace, played professional football with the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nWallace has had supporting roles in a number of films, including \"3 Strikes\" and the Coen Brothers film \"The Ladykillers\" (2004, as Sheriff Wyner). Wallace also appeared in \"Batman Forever\" (1995) as the Mayor of Gotham City.

Originally built in 1927 for the 1929 International Exposition in the city (and Barcelona's bid for the 1936 Summer Olympics, which were awarded to Berlin), it was renovated in 1989 to be the main stadium for the 1992 Summer Olympics. It is now used mainly as the home stadium of local amateur side FC Penger.\n\nWith its current capacity of 60,713 seats (67,007 during the 1992 Olympics), Estadi Lluís Companys is the 5th-largest stadium in Spain and the 2nd-largest in Catalunya.\n\nThe stadium is located in the Anella Olímpica, in Montjuïc, a large hill to the southwest of the city which overlooks the harbor.\n\nDesigned by architect Pere Domènech i Roura for the 1929 Expo, the stadium was officially opened on 20 May 1929. Montjuïc hosted its first ever event, Spain's first official rugby international game against Italy.\n\nIt was meant to host the People's Olympiad in 1936, a protest event against the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, but the event had to be cancelled due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nIn the fifties, the stadium was the centerpiece of the 1955 Mediterranean Games, and in 1957 it hosted the only national football cup Final between FC Barcelona and RCD Espanyol, the two local clubs.\n\nIn the seventies the stadium was disused, and the stands deteriorated. When the Spanish Grand Prix and other races were held at the Montjuïc racing circuit, the stadium was used as a paddock for the teams. Due to safety concerns, the 1975 F1 race was nearly boycotted by drivers.\n\nDue to the award of the 1992 Summer Olympics to Barcelona, the stadium was renovated with the involvement of Italian architect Vittorio Gregotti. The stadium was gutted, preserving only the original facades, and new grandstands were built. In 1989 the venue was re-inaugurated for the World Cup in Athletics, and three years later it hosted the opening and closing ceremonies and the athletics competitions of the Olympic Games.\n\nThe stadium served as the home of football club RCD Espanyol from 1997 until 2009. The Estadi Olímpic made its final La Liga appearance during the 2008–2009 season, as Espanyol moved to the newly constructed RCDE Stadium.\n\nIt also served as the home of the Barcelona Dragons American football team until 2002. Because the size of the playing surface was slightly shorter than the regulation American Football length, the stadium only had 7-yard end zones, three yards shorter than regulation NFL size in 1991 and 1992. They were later lengthened to the standard 10 yards. The stadium also played host to the National Football League's American Bowl in 1993 and in 1994. The San Francisco 49ers played the Pittsburgh Steelers on 1 August 1993. The second game was played on 31 July 1994 between the Los Angeles Raiders and the Denver Broncos.\n\nIn 2001, the stadium was renamed after the former president of the Generalitat de Catalunya Lluís Companys, who was executed at the nearby Montjuïc Castle in 1940 by the Franco regime. In 2010, the stadium hosted the 20th European Athletics Championships.\n\nOn 20 October 2018, the stadium management agreed with FC Penger over the use of the stadium, and now the stadium acts as the home field for the 2019–20 season.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a four-time All-Star and a Gold Glove Award winner.\n\nBeckert attended Perry Traditional Academy in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was named All-City in baseball and basketball, and graduated in 1958. He attended Allegheny College, where he played college baseball, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in political science in 1962.\nThe Boston Red Sox signed Beckert as an amateur free agent in 1962, and that year he was selected by the Chicago Cubs from Red Sox in the first-year minor league draft. He spent three years in the minors as a shortstop, where he led the Pacific Coast League in putouts and assists in 1964.\n\nFollowing the sudden death of Cubs second baseman Ken Hubbs in 1964, the Cubs brought Beckert to the major leagues as their second baseman for the 1965 season. Beckert played nine seasons as the Cubs' second baseman. During his entire Cub tenure, he played alongside shortstop Don Kessinger. Beckert led the National League in assists during his rookie year. He was a tough batter, leading the league five times in fewest strikeouts per at bats.\n\nIn 1968, Beckert led the league in runs scored. He also won the National League's Gold Glove Award for second baseman, ending Bill Mazeroski's run of five consecutive Gold Glove Awards. In 1969, he was chosen for his first of four consecutive All-Star Games. He had his best offensive season in 1971 when he hit for a career-high .342 batting average to finish third in the National League batting championship behind Joe Torre and Ralph Garr.\n\nAfter the 1973 season, the Cubs traded Beckert along with Bobby Fenwick to the San Diego Padres for Jerry Morales. Beckert was a utility infielder and pinch hitter with the Padres before being released in May 1975. He is an inductee in the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nIn an 11-year career, Beckert played in 1,320 games, accumulating 1,473 hits in 5,208 at bats for a .283 career batting average along with 22 home runs and 360 runs batted in. He posted a .973 career fielding percentage.\n\nBeckert married Mary Marshall, a flight attendant, in November 1967.\n\nBeckert died on April 12, 2020.\n\n\n"}

Likewise, there is no official orthography of the Zürich dialect. When it is written, it rarely follows the guidelines published by Eugen Dieth in his book \"Schwyzertütschi Dialäktschrift\". Furthermore, Dieth's spelling uses a lot of diacritical marks not found on a normal keyboard. Young people often use Swiss German for personal messages, such as when texting with their mobile phones. As they do not have a standard way of writing they tend to blend Standard German spelling with Swiss German phrasing.\n\nThe Zurich dialect is generally perceived as fast spoken, less melodic than, for example, the Bernese.

In 930 he entered into open rebellion with fellow military governor Dong Zhang; although their rebellion was initially successful, Meng wished to submit once more to the rule of the Later Tang and so in 932 the two rebel leaders turned on each other. Meng defeated Dong and, in addition to taking control of Dong's lands, was given even greater authority than before by the Later Tang government.

It is a division within the Engaged Communities Group of the Department for Communities (DfC).\n\nThe Public Record Office of Northern Ireland is distinguished from other archival institutions in the United Kingdom by its unique combination of private and official records. The Record Office is not the Northern Ireland equivalent or imitation of any Great Britain or Republic of Ireland archival institution. It combines the functions and responsibilities of a range of institutions: it is at the same time Public Record Office, manuscripts department of a national library, county record office for the six counties of Northern Ireland, and holder of a large range of private records. This range of remit, embracing, among others, central and local government, the churches and the private sector, is unique to Northern Ireland.\n\nPRONI was established by the Public Records Act (Northern Ireland), 1923. The new body opened to the public on Monday 3 March 1924 on the fourth floor of a former linen warehouse in central Belfast (at Murray Street). The immediate challenge was to identify and preserve surrogates of records lost in Dublin during the Four Courts fire on 30 June 1922. The first Deputy Keeper, Dr David A. Chart successfully replaced many of these records by approaching solicitors, business people, politicians, churches and the landed aristocracy.\n\nThe success of Chart's acquisition policy meant that PRONI needed more storage space. In April 1933, the office moved to a new central Belfast location, the first floor of the new Royal Courts of Justice in Chichester Street. However, it was not until 1965, that the Ministry of Finance would approve an actual purpose built repository. This new building, opened in 1972, at Balmoral Avenue and was the first new record office to be built in the UK since the Public Record Office in London was erected in 1838.\n\nBetween 1924 and 1982 PRONI was part of the Ministry (later Department) of Finance. The functions were then transferred to the Department of the Environment (DOE), and in 1995, PRONI became an executive agency within the DOE. With the restoration of devolved government in 1999, PRONI became an agency within the new Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL). The department brought together for the first time overall responsibility for libraries, museums and archives. As part of the implementation of the Review of Public Administration, PRONI ceased to be an agency in 2006 and became a division within the core department. On 9 May 2016, PRONI became a division within the Engaged Communities Group as part of the newly created Department for Communities (DfC).\n\nIn March 2011, PRONI reopened in new purpose built premises at 2 Titanic Boulevard, BT3 9HQ, in the Titanic Quarter of Belfast, approximately one mile from the city centre. The £29 million new headquarters includes a larger public search room, a reading room with seats for 78 users (most of which have access to power for laptops), a wifi cafe, microfilm readers, self-service digital cameras for digital copying, electronic information points, public art integrated into the fabric of the building, lecture theatre facilities, and dedicated exhibition space.\n\nPRONI is easily accessed from Belfast City Hall via the Metro (Belfast) 26, 26A and 26B bus services. The Belfast Rapid Transport Glider Service - G2 also serves Titanic Quarter and operates daily every 10 minutes to and from Wellington Place. PRONI is in close proximity to the Titanic Quarter railway station (formerly Bridge End) and George Best Belfast City Airport.\n\nTitanic Quarter is also home to leading tourist attractions including \"Titanic\" Belfast, , , SSE Arena, Titanic Exhibition Centre and Titanic Studios (aka the Paint Hall Studios) where \"Game of Thrones\" is filmed.\n\nPRONI currently holds 54 kilometres of records. These records date largely from c.1600 to the present day but a few date as far back as the early 13th century, with the oldest document being a bull of Pope Honorius III, dated 1219. Records range from public documents, such as those created by the NI government departments, to private records, such as letters or diaries.\n\nThe records at PRONI relate chiefly to present day Northern Ireland. The office holds a number of records relating to other parts of the island of Ireland which have been received from private depositors and include amongst others: the Kenmare Papers of Co. Kerry; the Lissadell Papers of Co. Sligo; and Conolly Papers of Co. Kildare.\n\nThere is no entry fee for access to records. New visitors must produce photographic proof of identity in order to register and use the research facilities. Anyone over 16 can register as a PRONI visitor.\n\nThe collection at PRONI can be accessed by the electronic catalogue. Documents are ordered using the onsite ordering system in the PRONI Search Room and are produced in the PRONI Reading Room. Visitors can order up to five documents at a time. Since December 2016, PRONI has allowed visitors to copy many records using their own cameras.\n\nPRONI also provides direct access to the most up to date births, marriages and deaths database hosted by General Register Office (Northern Ireland).\n\nIn September 2011, the Northern Ireland Assembly accepted a Legislative Consent Motion to reduce the time limit for release of official records from 30 years to 20 years (\"the 20-year Rule\"). This is underpinned by the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the amendments made to it by the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. The 20 Year Rule is being phased in over 10 years, with two years' worth of records being reviewed and released each year.\n\nThe PRONI website supports a number of free online resources including \n\nPRONI delivers a programme of events, talks, conferences, book launches and exhibitions over the course of the year. Many of which are in conjunction with partner institutions and other DfC sponsored bodies. Details can be found on the PRONI website or by subscribing to the monthly PRONI Express.\n\nPRONI makes available filmed presentations, lectures and conferences on The PRONI YouTube channel. These cover a wide range of subjects including amongst others: family and local history, marking centenaries, culture, wars and conflicts, migration and the Ulster Plantation.\n\n"}

This was the world's first practical cable car system, and Hallidie is often therefore regarded as the inventor of the cable car and father of the present day San Francisco cable car system, although both claims are open to dispute. He also introduced the manufacture of wire rope to California, and at an early age was a prolific builder of bridges in the Californian interior.\n\nAndrew Smith Hallidie was born Andrew Smith, later adopting the name Hallidie in honor of his uncle, Sir Andrew Hallidie. His birthplace is variously quoted as London in the United Kingdom. His mother, Julia Johnstone Smith, was from Lockerbie, Dumfriesshire and his father, Andrew Smith (a prolific inventor in his own right, responsible for inventing the first box door spring, a floor cramp and had an early patent for wire rope) was born in Fleming, Dumfrieshire, Scotland, in 1798.\n\nAt age 13 the younger Smith was initially apprenticed to a machine shop and drawing office operated by his older brother Archibald. In 1852 at age 16 father and son sailed for California, where the father had an interest in some gold mines in Mariposa County. These proved disappointing, and the father returned to England in 1853. The son, however, remained in California, and became a gold miner whilst also working as a blacksmith, surveyor and builder of bridges.\n\nIn 1856, while working on the construction of a flume at a mine at American Bar, Hallidie was consulted over the rapid rate of wear on the ropes used to lower cars of rock from the mine to the mill. These ropes were wearing out in 75 days. Hallidie improvised machinery to make a replacement wire rope to his father's design, which lasted two years, and in the process began wire rope manufacture in California.\n\nHallidie abandoned mining in 1857 and returned to San Francisco. Under the name of A. S. Hallidie & Co., he commenced the manufacture of wire rope in a building at Mason and Chestnut Streets, using the machinery from American Bar.\n\nHallidie was also heavily involved in bridge building. During 1861–2, he constructed bridges across the Klamath River at Weitchpeck, at Nevada City, across the American River at Folsom, and across the Bear, Trinity, Stanislaus, and Tuolumne rivers. In 1863 he built a bridge across the Fraser River, upstream of Yale at Alexandra in British Columbia.\n\nAlso in 1863, Hallidie married Martha Elizabeth Woods. They had no children. In 1864, he became a United States citizen. In 1865, he gave up bridge building in order to devote himself entirely to his wire rope manufacturing business, which was experiencing increased demand from the silver mines on the Comstock Lode.\n\nIn 1867, Hallidie invented the Hallidie ropeway, a form of aerial tramway used for transporting ore and other material across mountainous districts, which he successfully installed a number of locations, and later patented.\n\nAccounts differ as to exactly how involved Hallidie was in the inception of the Clay Street Hill Railway. One version has him taking over the promotion of the line when the original promoter, Benjamin Brooks, failed to raise the necessary capital. In another version, Hallidie was the instigator, inspired by a desire to reduce the suffering incurred by the horses that hauled streetcars up Jackson Street, from Kearny to Stockton Street.\n\nThere is also doubt as to when exactly the first run of the cable car occurred. The franchise required the first run no later than August 1, 1873, but at least one source reports that the run took place a day late, on August 2, although the city chose not to void the franchise. Some accounts say that the first gripman hired by Hallidie looked down the steep hill from Jones and refused to operate the car, so Hallidie took the grip himself and ran the car down the hill and up again without any problems.\n\nThe named engineer of the Clay Street line was William Eppelsheimer. However, Hallidie's previous experience of cables and cable haulage systems make it likely that he contributed to the design of the system.\n\nThe Clay Street line started regular service on September 1, 1873, and was a financial success. In addition, Hallidie's patents on the cable car design were stringently enforced on cable car promoters around the world and made him a rich man.\n\nHallidie occupied many positions in San Francisco society. He served as a regent of the University of California from 1868 until his death, and as a trustee and vice-president of the San Francisco Mechanics Institute in 1864 and president from 1868 to 1877 and from 1893 to 1895. In 1873, Hallidie stood for election to the California State Senate, and in 1875 he stood for election as mayor of San Francisco, but in both cases, he was defeated.\n\nHallidie served as a trustee of the First Unitarian Church, and as its moderator in 1883 and 1884. He held memberships in the American Society of Inventors, American Geographical Society, California Academy of Sciences, and other scientific and literary bodies. He was a member of the old California Historical Society and of the Pacific-Union, Olympic, and Sierra clubs.\n\nA. S. Hallidie & Co. became the California Wire Works in 1883 with Hallidie as president. In 1895, it was sold to Washburn and Moen Co., the oldest manufacturers of wire in the United States (established in 1831).\n\nHallidie died on April 24, 1900, at the age of 64 of heart disease at his San Francisco residence.\n\nIn San Francisco, Hallidie Plaza (near the Powell and Market Street cable car turntable) and the Hallidie Building (an office building in the city's Financial District) are named after him.\n\n"}
{"id": "1905018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905018", "title": "Freakonomics", "text": "Freakonomics\n\nFreakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything is the debut non-fiction book by University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt and \"New York Times\" journalist Stephen J. Dubner. It was published on April 12, 2005, by William Morrow. The book has been described as melding pop culture with economics. By late 2009, the book had sold over 4 million copies worldwide.\n\nThe book is a collection of articles written by Levitt, an expert who had gained a reputation for applying economic theory to diverse subjects not usually covered by \"traditional\" economists. In \"Freakonomics\", Levitt and Dubner argue that economics is, at root, the study of incentives. The book's chapters cover:\n\nOne example of the authors' use of economic theory involves demonstrating the existence of cheating among sumo wrestlers. In a sumo tournament, all wrestlers in the top division compete in 15 matches and face demotion if they do not win at least eight of them. The sumo community is very close-knit, and the wrestlers at the top levels tend to know each other well. The authors looked at the final match, and considered the case of a wrestler with seven wins, seven losses, and one fight to go, fighting against an 8–6 wrestler. Statistically, the 7–7 wrestler should have a slightly below even chance, since the 8–6 wrestler is slightly better. However, the 7–7 wrestler actually wins around 80% of the time. Levitt uses this statistic and other data gleaned from sumo wrestling matches, along with the effect that allegations of corruption have on match results, to conclude that those who already have 8 wins collude with those who are 7–7 and let them win, since they have already secured their position for the following tournament. Despite condemnation of the claims by the Japan Sumo Association following the book's publication in 2005, the 2011 Grand Tournament in Tokyo was canceled for the first time since 1946 because of allegations of match-fixing.\n\nThe authors attempt to demonstrate the power of data mining, as a number of their results emerge from Levitt's analysis of various databases. The authors posit that various incentives encourage teachers to cheat by assisting their students with multiple-choice high-stakes tests. Such cheating in the Chicago school system is inferred from detailed analysis of students' answers to multiple-choice questions. Levitt asks, \"What would the pattern of answers look like if the teacher cheated?\", and hypotheses that the more difficult questions found at the end of test sections will be answered correctly more frequently than the easy questions at the beginning of test sections.\n\nIn Chapter 2 of \"Freakonomics\", the authors wrote of their visit to folklorist Stetson Kennedy's Florida home where the topic of Kennedy's investigations of the Ku Klux Klan were discussed. However, in their January 8, 2006, column in \"The New York Times Magazine\", Dubner and Levitt wrote of questions about Stetson Kennedy's research (\"Hoodwinked\", pp. 26–28) leading to the conclusion that Kennedy's research was at times embellished for effectiveness.\n\nIn the \"Revised and Expanded Edition\" this embellishment was noted and corrected:\n\"Several months after \"Freakonomics\" was first published, it was brought to our attention that this man's portrayal of his crusade, and various other Klan matters, was considerably overstated ... we felt it was important to set straight the historical record.\"\n\n\"Freakonomics\" has been criticized for being a work of sociology or criminology, rather than economics. Israeli economist Ariel Rubinstein criticized the book for making use of dubious statistics and complained that \"economists like Levitt ... have swaggered off into other fields\", saying that the \"connection to economics ... [is] none\" and that the book is an example of \"academic imperialism\". Arnold Kling has suggested the book is an example of \"amateur sociology\".\n\nRevisiting a question first studied empirically in the 1960s, Donohue and Levitt argue that the legalization of abortion can account for almost half of the reduction in crime witnessed in the 1990s. This paper has sparked much controversy, to which Levitt has said\n\nIn 2003, Theodore Joyce argued that legalized abortion had little impact on crime, contradicting Donohue and Levitt's results (\"Did Legalized Abortion Lower Crime?\" Journal of Human Resources, 2003, 38(1), pp. 1–37). In 2004, the authors published a response, in which they argued that Joyce's argument was flawed due to omitted-variable bias.\n\nIn November 2005, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston economist Christopher Foote and his research assistant Christopher Goetz published a working paper, in which they argued that the results in Donohue and Levitt's abortion and crime paper were due to statistical errors made by the authors: the omission of state-year interactions and the use of the total number of arrests instead of the arrest rate in explaining changes in the murder rate. When the corrections were made, Foote and Goetz argued that abortion actually increased violent crime instead of decreasing it and did not affect property crime. They even concluded that the majority of women who had abortions in the 1970s were middle class whites rather than low income minorities as Levitt stated; this was, they stated, because white middle-class women had the financial means for an abortion. \"The Economist\" remarked on the news of the errors that \"for someone of Mr Levitt's iconoclasm and ingenuity, technical ineptitude is a much graver charge than moral turpitude. To be politically incorrect is one thing; to be simply incorrect quite another.\" In January 2006, Donohue and Levitt published a response, in which they admitted the errors in their original paper but also pointed out Foote and Goetz's correction was flawed due to heavy attenuation bias. The authors argued that, after making necessary changes to fix the original errors, the corrected link between abortion and crime was now weaker but still statistically significant, contrary to Foote and Goetz's claims. Foote and Goetz, however, soon produced a rebuttal of their own and said that even after analyzing the data using the methods that Levitt and Donohue recommend, the data does not show a positive correlation between abortion rates and crime rates. They are quick to point out that this does not necessarily disprove Levitt's thesis, however, and emphasize that with data this messy and incomplete, it is in all likelihood not even possible to prove or disprove Donohue and Levitt's conclusion.\n\n\"Freakonomics\" commented on the effects of an abortion ban in Romania (Decree 770), stating that \"Compared to Romanian children born just a year earlier, the cohort of children born after the abortion ban would do worse in every measurable way: they would test lower in school, they would have less success in the labor market, and they would also prove much more likely to become criminals. (p. 118)\". John DiNardo, a professor at the University of Michigan, retorts that the paper cited by \"Freakonomics\" states \"virtually the opposite of what is actually claimed\":\nLevitt responded on the \"Freakonomics\" Blog that \"Freakonomics\" and Pop-Eleches \"are saying the same thing\":\n\"Freakonomics\" claimed that it was possible to \"tease out\" the effect of extra police on crime by analyzing electoral cycles. The evidence behind these claims was shown to be due partly to a programming error. McCrary stated \"While municipal police force size does appear to vary over state and local electoral cycles ... elections do not induce enough variation in police hiring to generate informative estimates of the effect of police on crime.\"\n\nOn April 10, 2006, John Lott filed suit for defamation against Steven Levitt and HarperCollins Publishers over the book and against Levitt over a series of emails to retired economist John B. McCall. In the book \"Freakonomics\", Levitt and coauthor Stephen J. Dubner claimed that the results of Lott's research in \"More Guns, Less Crime\" had not been replicated by other academics. In the emails to McCall, who had pointed to a number of papers in different academic publications that had replicated Lott's work, Levitt wrote that the work by authors supporting Lott in a special 2001 issue of \"The Journal of Law and Economics\" had not been peer-reviewed, alleged that Lott had paid the University of Chicago Press to publish the papers, and that papers with results opposite of Lott's had been blocked from publication in that issue.\n\nA federal judge found that Levitt's replication claim in \"Freakonomics\" was not defamation but found merit in Lott's complaint about the email claims.\n\nLevitt settled the second defamation claim by admitting in a letter to John B. McCall that he himself was a peer reviewer in the 2001 issue of \"The Journal of Law and Economics\", that Lott had not engaged in bribery (paying for extra costs of printing and postage for a conference issue is customary), and that he knew that \"scholars with varying opinions\" (including Levitt himself) had been invited to participate. The \"Chronicle of Higher Education\" characterized Levitt's letter as offering \"a doozy of a concession\".\n\nThe dismissal of the first half of Lott's suit was unanimously upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on February 11, 2009.\n\n\"Freakonomics\" peaked at number two among nonfiction on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list and was named the 2006 Book Sense Book of the Year in the Adult Nonfiction category. The book received positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator Metacritic reported the book had an average score of 67 out of 100, based on 16 reviews.\"Freakonomics\" has a social review score 69/100 on Panjury.\nThe success of the book has been partly attributed to the blogosphere. In the campaign prior to the release of the book in April 2005, publisher (William Morrow and Company) chose to target bloggers in an unusually strategical way, sending galley copies to over a hundred of them, as well as contracting two specialized buzz marketing agencies.\n\nIn 2006, the \"Revised and Expanded Edition\" of the book was published, with the most significant corrections in the second chapter.\n\nThe book has been banned from Texas prisons.\nThe authors started their own Freakonomics blog in 2005.\n\nIn May 2007, writer and blogger Melissa Lafsky was hired as the full-time editor of the site. In August 2007, the blog was incorporated into \"The New York Times\" web site – the authors had been writing joint columns for \"The New York Times Magazine\" since 2004 – and the domain Freakonomics.com became a redirect there. In March 2008, Annika Mengisen replaced Lafsky as the blog editor. The Freakonomics blog ended its association with \"The New York Times\" on March 1, 2011.\n\nAmong the recurrent guest bloggers on the Freakonomics blog are Ian Ayres, Daniel Hamermesh, Eric A. Morris, Sudhir Venkatesh, Justin Wolfers and others.\n\nIn 2008, Stephen Dubner asked for questions from the site's readers and then featured them in an extended Q&A on \"Best Places to Live\" with demographics expert Bert Sperling.\n\nIn April 2007, co-author Stephen Dubner announced that there would be a sequel to \"Freakonomics\", and that it would contain further writings about street gang culture from Sudhir Venkatesh, as well as a study of the use of money by capuchin monkeys. Dubner said the title would be \"SuperFreakonomics\", and that one topic would be what makes people good at what they do. The book was released in Europe in early October 2009 and in the United States on October 20, 2009.\n\nIn September 2010, Marketplace radio announced the creation of a Freakonomics podcast hosted by Dubner and Levitt. It is available on iTunes and is aired bi-weekly on NPR.\n\nIn 2010, Chad Troutwine, Chris Romano, and Dan O'Meara produced a documentary film adaptation with a budget of nearly US$3 million in an omnibus format by directors Seth Gordon, Morgan Spurlock, Alex Gibney, Eugene Jarecki, Rachel Grady, and Heidi Ewing. It was the Closing Night Gala premiere film at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 30, 2010. It was also the Opening Night film at the AFI/Discovery SilverDocs film festival on June 21, 2010. Magnolia Pictures acquired distribution rights for a Fall 2010 release.\n\n\"Freakonomics: The Movie\" was released in major cities with a pay what you want pricing offer for selected preview showings. No report of the results has yet been published.\n\nIn 2009, Steven Levitt co-founded Freakonomics Consulting Group, a business and philanthropy consulting company which became The Greatest Good and is now known as TGG Group. Founding partners include Nobel laureates Daniel Kahneman and Gary Becker, as well as several other prominent economists.\n\n\n\n"}

At Tokyo Disneyland, this land is named Toontown. A similar land existed at the Magic Kingdom until 2011 and was named Mickey's Toontown Fair. Walt Disney Studios Park in Disneyland Paris has a related land called Toon Studio.\n\nThe attraction is a small-scale recreation of the Mickey Mouse universe where visitors can meet the characters and visit their homes which are constructed in a cartoonish style. It was inspired by \"Toontown\" from the 1988 film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" in which cartoon characters live apart from humans.\n\nRoger Rabbit was recognized as a lucrative character by Disney after the release of \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", and a set of attractions based on the movie was developed for Disney theme parks. Roger Rabbit was set to be the star of his own land, behind Main Street, U.S.A. at Disneyland, called Hollywoodland. Meanwhile, at the Magic Kingdom, a new land behind Fantasyland was being developed in honor of Mickey Mouse's sixtieth birthday, aptly named Mickey's Birthdayland. There were also set to be attractions based on Roger Rabbit, Judge Doom, and Baby Herman opening in a major expansion at the Disney's Hollywood Studios and Tokyo Disneyland, but after the financial troubles of the Euro Disney Resort, plans were cut back.\n\nHollywoodland was combined with the concept of Mickey's Birthdayland, as well as a concept found in \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", to form Mickey's Toontown, which opened in 1993 behind Fantasyland at Disneyland. The attractions at Disney-MGM Studios were canceled, but an exact replica of Mickey's Toontown opened at Tokyo Disneyland in 1996. Disneyland Paris features a similar 'Toon Studio' in its Walt Disney Studios Park. Walt Disney World, Hong Kong Disneyland, and Shanghai Disneyland are the only Disney resorts to have neither a Toontown or Toon Studio.\n\nAt the Magic Kingdom, Mickey's Toontown Fair (now Storybook Circus) initially opened as Mickey's Birthdayland on June 18, 1988. It became Mickey's Starland on May 26, 1990, and was briefly renamed Mickey's Toyland in late 1995. The land was closed in early 1996 for an extensive refurbishment, and on October 1, 1996, it reopened as \"Mickey's Toontown Fair\" for the park's 25th anniversary. Its storyline portrayed the land as the vacation home for the characters who reside at Mickey's Toontown in California.\n\nMickey's Toontown Fair was closed on February 11, 2011 in order to build the \"New Fantasyland\" expansion. Some elements of Mickey's Toontown Fair have been demolished and others have been re-themed to a new Storybook Circus area. The Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride was removed from Fantasyland and rebuilt in Storybook Circus, the new version doubling the capacity of the old ride and incorporating an interactive queue. The Barnstormer at Goofy's Wiseacre Farm has been re-themed to The Barnstormer featuring Goofy as the Great Goofini. The first half of Storybook Circus opened on March 12, 2012, which included the newly themed \"The Great Goofini\", the Storybook Circus train station which was completely rebuilt and also one half of the new Dumbo ride. The second phase of Storybook Circus, including the second half of Dumbo, the indoor queue area, and the Casey Jr Splash 'n' Soak Station opened in July 2012.\n\n\n\nMickey's Toontown opened in Disneyland on January 24, 1993. The area is inspired by \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", and resembles a set from a Max Fleischer cartoon. The buildings are stylized and colorful. There are several attractions involving classic cartoon characters, such as the houses of Mickey and Minnie Mouse, and a small children's coaster. There are a few interactive gags. Compared to other Disneyland areas however, there are few large or technically complex rides or shows, and the houses themselves appeal primarily as play areas for small children. On one of the windows above the library in this land, there is a reference to Laugh-O-Gram Studios, the studio that Disney created before the Disney Studios.\n\nAn early entry event called Toontown Morning Madness was held here for guests booking travel with the American Automobile Association (AAA) or book a vacation package with the Walt Disney Travel Company. However, \"Morning Madness\" has been discontinued as of 2013 as Extra Magic Hour and Magic Morning are now offered. On nights that fireworks are scheduled, the land will close early for the day due to its proximity to the launch area for the fireworks. Mickey's Toontown Depot stays open from park opening to park closing as it also serves as a stop for Fantasyland with the station being next to the Fantasyland Theatre. On non-fireworks days, the land closes with the park.\n\nIn April 2019, Disney announced that Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway, already under construction at Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World, would open at Mickey's Toontown in Disneyland in 2022. The attraction, which is expected to replace the Gag Factory store, will be the first new attraction added to Mickey's Toontown since Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin opened in 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToontown (Japanese language: トゥーンタウン) opened in Tokyo Disneyland on April 15, 1996. It is largely a copy of Mickey's Toontown at Disneyland, with a mirror image of its layout.\n\nIn mid May 2017, the entrance to Toontown was removed, to be replaced with Minnie's Style Studio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1905040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905040", "title": "Dendera light", "text": "Dendera light\n\nThe Dendera light is a motif carved as a set of stone reliefs in the Hathor temple at Dendera in Egypt, which superficially resemble modern electric lighting devices. A fringe hypothesis suggests that the Dendera light depicts advanced electrical technology possessed by the ancient Egyptians; however, mainstream Egyptologists view the carvings as representing instead a typical set of symbolic images from Egyptian mythology. These depict a \"djed\" pillar and a lotus flower spawning a snake inside it, symbols of stability and fertility, respectively.\n\nThe view of Egyptologists is that the relief is a mythological depiction of a \"djed\" pillar and a lotus flower (\"Nymphaea caerulea\"), spawning a snake within, representing aspects of Egyptian mythology. The \"djed\" pillar is a symbol of stability which is also interpreted as the backbone of the god Osiris. In the carvings the four horizontal lines forming the capital of the \"djed\" are supplemented by human arms stretching out, as if the \"djed\" were a backbone. The arms hold up the snake within the lotus flower. The snakes coming from the lotus symbolize fertility, linked to the annual Nile flood.\n\nIn contrast to the mainstream interpretation, a fringe hypothesis proposes that the reliefs depict Ancient Egyptian electrical technology, based on comparison to similar modern devices (such as Geissler tubes, Crookes tubes, and arc lamps). J. N. Lockyer's passing reference to a colleague's humorous suggestion that electric lamps would explain the absence of lampblack deposits in the tombs has sometimes been forwarded as an argument supporting this particular interpretation (another argument being made is the use of a system of reflective mirrors).\nProponents of this interpretation have also used a text referring to \"high poles covered with copper plates\" to argue this, but Bolko Stern has written in detail explaining why the copper-covered tops of poles (which were lower than the associated pylons) do not relate to electricity or lightning, pointing out that no evidence of anything used to manipulate electricity had been found in Egypt and that this was a magical and not a technical installation.\n\nArchaeologist and debunker Kenneth Feder argued that if ancient Egyptians really had such advanced technology, some light bulb remains (glass shards, metal sockets, filaments...) should have been discovered during archaeological excavations. By applying the Occam's razor, he instead highlighted the feasibility of the aforementioned reflective mirrors system, and also that the notion of adding salt to torches to minimize lampblack was well known by ancient Egyptians.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1905051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905051", "title": "Personal god", "text": "Personal god\n\nA personal god is a deity who can be related to as a person instead of as an impersonal force, such as the Absolute, \"the All\", or the \"Ground of Being\".\n\nIn the scriptures of the Abrahamic religions, God is described as being a personal creator, speaking in the first person and showing emotion such as anger and pride, and sometimes appearing in anthropomorphic shape. In the Pentateuch, for example, God talks with and instructs his prophets and is conceived as possessing volition, emotions (such as anger, grief and happiness), intention, and other attributes characteristic of a human person. Personal relationships with God may be described in the same ways as human relationships, such as a Father, as in Christianity, or a Friend as in Sufism.\n\nA 2019 survey by the Pew Research Center reported that, of U.S. adults, 70% view that \"God is a person with whom people can have a relationship,\" while 15% believe that \"God is an impersonal force.\"\nA 2019 survey by the National Opinion Research Center reports that 77.5% of U.S. adults believe in a personal god.\nThe 2014 Religious Landscape survey conducted by Pew reported that 77% of U.S. adults believe in a personal god.\n\nIn the Baha'i Faith God is described as \"a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty\". Although transcendent and inaccessible directly, his image is reflected in his creation. The purpose of creation is for the created to have the capacity to know and love its creator. God communicates his will and purpose to humanity through intermediaries, known as Manifestations of God, who are the prophets and messengers that have founded religions from prehistoric times up to the present day.\n\nIn the case of the Christian belief in the Trinity, whether the Holy Spirit is impersonal – or personal, is the subject of dispute, with experts in pneumatology debating the matter. Jesus (or God the Son) and God the Father are believed to be two persons or aspects of the same god. Jesus is of the same \"ousia\" or substance as God the Father, manifested in three \"hypostases\" or persons (the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit). Nontrinitarian Christians dispute that Jesus is a \"hypostasis\" or person of God.\n\nMost Islamic sources teach that God is a personal God, he speaks in the Quran in first person and has personal attributes, yet the Quran still maintains that God is unique in nature and substance and has no similarity to anything else. Islam also teaches that God is beyond comprehension, and the best way for Muslims to have a relationship of God is to obey his commands.\n\nThe Quran asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world: a unique and indivisible being who is independent of the entire creation. The Qur'an clearly opposes conceiving God as resembling \"the creation\" and it maintains that whatever image a believer has of God is not God, and that he is truly transcendental. According to the Qur'an:\n\"Say: He is God, the One and Only; God, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him.\" (Sura , \"Suraah Ikhlaas\") <br>Thy Lord is self-sufficient, full of Mercy: if it were God's will, God could destroy you, and in your place appoint whom God will as your successors, even as God raised you up from the posterity of other people.\" (Sura , \"Yusuf Ali\")\n\nJewish theology states that God is not a person. However, there exist frequent references to anthropomorphic characteristics of God in the Hebrew Bible such as the \"Hand of God.\" Judaism holds that these are to be taken only as figures of speech. Their purpose is to make God more comprehensible to the human reader. As God is beyond human understanding, there are different ways of describing him. He is said to be both personal and impersonal; he has a relationship with his creation but is beyond all relationships.\n\nIn general, most deists view God as a personal God. This is illustrated by the 17th-century assertions of Lord Edward Herbert, universally regarded as the Father of English deism, which stated that there is one Supreme God, and he ought to be worshiped. However, deism is a general belief encompassing people with varying specific beliefs, and the notion of God as a personal God cannot be ascribed to all deists.\n\nChristian deism is a term applied both to Christians who incorporate deistic principles into their beliefs and to deists who follow the moral teachings of Jesus without believing in his divinity. With regard to those who are essentially deists who follow the moral teachings of Jesus, these are a subset of classical deists. Consequently, they believe in a personal God, but they do not necessarily believe in a personal relationship with God.\n\nClassical deists who adhere to Herbert's common notion certainly believe in a personal God because those notions include the belief that God dispenses rewards and punishments both in this life and after it. This is not something which would be done by an impersonal force. However, a personal relationship with God is not contemplated, since living a virtuous and pious life is seen as the primary means of worshiping God.\n\nHumanist deists accept the core principles of deism but incorporate humanist beliefs into their faith. Thus, humanistic deists believe in a personal God who created the universe. The key element that separates humanistic deists from other deists is the emphasis on the importance of human development over religious development and on the relationships among human beings over the relationships between humans and God. Those who self-identify as humanistic deists may take an approach based upon what is found in classical deism and allow their worship of God to manifest itself primarily (or exclusively) in the manner in which they treat others. Other humanistic deists may prioritize their relationships with other human beings over their relationship with God, yet still maintain a personal relationship with the Supreme Being.\n\nPandeists believe that in the process of creating the universe, God underwent a metamorphosis from a conscious and sentient being or force to an unconscious and unresponsive entity by becoming the universe. Consequently, pandeists do not believe that a personal God currently exists.\n\nPolydeists reject the notion that one Supreme Being would have created the universe and then left it to its own devices which is a common belief shared by many deists. Rather, they conclude that several gods who are superhuman but not omnipotent each created parts of the universe. Polydeists hold an affirmative belief that the gods who created the universe are completely uninvolved in the world and pose no threat and offer no hope to humanity. Polydeists see living virtuous and pious lives as the primary components of worshiping God, firmly adhering to one of the common notions set forth by Herbert. Thus, polydeists believe that there are several personal Gods. Yet, they do not believe they can have a relationship with any of them.\n\nScientific deists believe, based on an analysis utilizing the scientific method, that a personal God created the universe. This analysis finds no evidence of a purpose God may have had for creation of the universe or evidence that God attempted to communicate such purpose to humanity. It therefore concludes that there is no purpose to creation other than that which human beings choose to make for themselves. Thus, scientific deists believe in a personal God, but generally do not believe in relationships between God and human beings, since there is no proof of a purpose for creation.\n\nSpiritual deism is a belief in the core principles of deism with an emphasis on spirituality including the connections between humans and each other, nature and God. Within spiritual deism, there is an absolute belief in a personal God as the creator of the universe along with the ability to build a spiritual relationship with God. While Spiritual deism is nondogmatic, its followers generally believe that there can be no progress for mankind without a belief in a personal God.\n\nVaishnavism and Shaivism, traditions of Hinduism, subscribe to an ultimate personal nature of God. The Vishnu Sahasranama declares the person of Vishnu as both the Paramatma (supreme soul) and Parameshwara (supreme God) while the Rudram describes the same about Shiva. In Krishna-centered theology (Krishna is seen as a form of Vishnu by most, except Gaudiya Vaishnavism) the title \"Svayam Bhagavan\" is used exclusively to designate Krishna in his personal feature, it refers to Gaudiya Vaishnava, the Nimbarka Sampradaya and followers of Vallabha, while the person of Vishnu and Narayana is sometimes referred to as the ultimate personal god of other Vaishnava traditions.\n\nJainism explicitly denies existence of non-personal transcendent god and explicitly affirms existence of personal gods. All gods in Jainism are personal.\n\nOne of the major point of dispute between Digambara and Shwetambara is the gender of the gods. Digambara gods can only be men, and any man of at least eight years of age can become god if he follows the right procedure.\n\nJain gods are eternal, but they are not beginningless. Also, Jain gods are all omniscient, but not omnipotent. They are sometimes called quasi-gods due to this reason.\n\nGods are said to be free from the following eighteen imperfections:\n\n\nThe four infinitudes of god are (\"ananta cātuṣṭaya\") are: \n\nThose who re-establish the Jain faith are called Tirthankaras. They have additional attributes. \"Tirthankara\"s revitalize the sangha, the fourfold order consisting of male saints (sādhus), female saints (\"sādhvi\"s), male householders (\"śrāvaka\") and female householders (\"Śrāvika\").\n\nThe first Tirthankara of the current time cycle was Ṛṣabhanātha, and the twenty-fourth and last Tirthankara was Mahavira, who lived from 599 BCE to 527 BCE.\n\nJain texts mention forty-six attributes of \"arihants\" or \"tirthankaras\". These attributes comprise four infinitudes (\"ananta chatushtaya\"), thirty-four miraculous happenings (\"atiśaya\"), and eight splendours (\"prātihārya\").\n\nThe eight splendours (\"prātihārya\") are:\n\nAt the time of \"nirvana\" (final release), the \"arihant\" sheds off the remaining four \"aghati karmas\":\n\nAnd float at the top of the universe without losing their individuality and with the same shape and size as the body at the time of release.\n\n\n\n"}

The aircraft has retractable tricycle landing gear and a pressurized cabin. The two piston engines are turbocharged and the turbochargers also pressurize the cabin with bleed air.\n\nThe development of the Beechcraft 60 began in early 1965, and it was designed to fill the gap between the Beechcraft Baron and the Beechcraft Queen Air. On December 29, 1966, the prototype made its first flight. On February 1, 1968, the FAA issued the type certificate. Distribution to customers began in July 1968. The passenger cabin is fitted with club seating and entry is by means of a port-side airstair entry door in the rear fuselage.\n\nThe Beechcraft A60, which came onto the market in 1970, represented an advancement over the Baron, with an improved pressurized cabin utilizing advanced bonded honeycomb construction, lighter and more efficient turbochargers, and improved elevators. The last variant, the B60, was introduced in 1974. The interior arrangement was renewed and the engine efficiency again increased by improved turbochargers. The Beechcraft 60 was, despite its very good performance, only a moderate seller, principally because the complicated technology demanded a high expenditure on maintenance. Production was stopped in 1983.\n\nMost of the Duke B-60s still flying have retained their original equipment. Electro-mechanical systems, which were highly advanced when the aircraft was introduced, were superseded in other aircraft with simpler I/C controlled mechanical parts. The aircraft design uses turbocharged Lycoming TIO541-B4 engines that develop 380 hp each. Other systems, parts, and FAA certified technicians are increasingly difficult to locate. Normally, pilots figure 45 gallons per hour, plus another 40 gallons for each takeoff and climb as typical fuel consumption for cross country planning. Owners compare the Beechcraft B60 to classic sports cars—noting that they do not fly Dukes to economize. One area of particular maintenance concern involves the original construction of the tail section from a magnesium alloy, making that section of the airframe a common and expensive target of corrosion if not detected and treated quickly.\n\nSome Dukes have been modified by Rocket Engineering of Spokane, Washington, replacing the Lycoming reciprocating engines with Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-21 or -35 turbine engines. Called the Royal Turbine Duke conversion, the modification increases fuel capacity by 28 gallons and the maximum useful load by 400 pounds. The take-off length required is shortened by over 1,500 feet to only 1,000 feet and the landing distance is reduced by over 2,000 feet to only 900. The maximum rate of climb is increased from 1,600 feet per minute to 4,000 feet per minute, reducing the time to climb to 25,000 feet from 25 minutes to 9 minutes. The cruise speed is increased to 290 knots at 29,000 feet. The modification does have some disadvantages as it increases fuel burn from 56 gallons per hour to 66 and lowers the certified ceiling from 30,000 feet to 28,000.\n\nThe supplemental type certificate was issued on 2006-05-12.\n\nThe Duke was purchased by corporate and private pilot owners. Most were registered in the United States but examples were exported to many countries including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Croatia, Finland, France, Germany, Honduras, Iceland, Serbia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, South Africa and the United Kingdom. One Duke was flown by the Jamaica Defense Force. Many remain in service in the early twenty-first century.\n\nIn reviewing the aircraft in 2008, Rick Durden of AVweb stated, \"Built to the quality standards of a King Air, the six-place Duke sported 380-hp, Lycoming TIO-541 engines – rare beasts, those – which means when both come due for overhaul, the choice is the overhaul or buying a small house in the Midwest. The assertive lines of the airframe made for a startlingly attractive airplane, but led to high costs of manufacture and, surprising to the casual onlooker, horrendous drag. There are those who claim that the Duke was purposefully designed to be about 30 knots slower than it could easily have been on the available power simply because otherwise it would have been faster than the flagship of the Beech line, the King Air. The roughly 230-knot max. cruise speed is only marginally less than that of a King Air 90 and about the same as a Cessna 421, which carries more on slightly less horsepower. While the Duke shares the delightful handling of the Beech line, should pilots have the joy of single-engine operation, they will be up against the highest rudder-force of any piston twin – 150 pounds at Vmc – which happens to be the maximum the FAA allows. Owners report buying a Duke partially because of its looks, but selling it because of the cost of keeping it running. They describe King Air maintenance costs in a piston-twin airframe and recognize that the value of the airplane is entirely dependent on the engines. A gear-up landing means an engine teardown and propeller replacement, along with some sheet metal work. The cost is so high in relation to the value of the airframe that, in many cases, the insurance company will consider the airplane a total loss.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

St. Michaelis is a landmark of the city and it is considered to be one of the finest Hanseatic Protestant baroque churches. The church was purposely built Protestant unlike many other Hamburg churches which were originally built by Roman Catholics and were converted to Protestantism during the Reformation. It is dedicated to the Archangel Michael. A large bronze statue, standing above the portal of the church shows the archangel conquering the devil.\n\nThe 132-meter high Baroque spire totally covered with copper is a prominent feature of Hamburg's skyline and has always been a landfall mark for ships sailing up the river Elbe.\n\nThe present church building is the third one at this site. The first one was built from 1647 to 1669. It became the church of the new town (Neustadt), which was created in 1625 inside the new city walls, and which grew steadily since. In 1687, the Michel became the fifth chapter church (Hauptkirche), as the new town (Neustadt) became a parish. That church was destroyed on March 10, 1750, by a lightning strike. The original church has been replicated and built in 9 different cities around the world.\n\nIn 1786, a new construction following the design of and was completed. This is the church as we know it today. It was reconstructed twice in the 20th century: after catching fire in 1906 during construction work and after the bombings of 1944 and 1945. After the 1906 fire, the photos of Wilhelm Weimar were used to help recreate the church. Since 1983, renovation is ongoing: first the spire and then the roof.\n\nThe composer and pianist Johannes Brahms was baptized on May 26, 1833 in this church and confirmed at the age of fifteen by Pastor von Ahlsen, who had married Brahms's parents.\n\nOffering 2,500 seats, the \"Michel\" is the largest church in Hamburg. The church has a Latin cross plan with 44 m width, 52 m length and 27 m height.\n\nThe 132-meter-high, characteristic steeple dominates the skyline of the city and was considered as an orientation mark for ships sailing on the river Elbe. In 83 meters, the tower platform offers an excellent panoramic view over the city and the harbour, can be climbed, but there also is a lift. The clock in the church tower is the largest of its kind in Germany.\n\nThe church has five organs including a Marcussen organ and a large Steinmeyer organ with its 85 registers, 5 manuals and 6674 pipes. On 9 October 2008, St. Michael's received a new crypt organ, named after Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy.\n\nThe pulpit is in the center of the building which was crafted out of marble by sculptor Otto Lessing from Dresden in 1910. It was designed to look like a rounded chalice and features a magnificent staircase. The large pulpit roof is crowned by the Angel of Annunciation.\n\nMade from white marble, the baptismal font was crafted in Livorno in 1763 and donated by Hamburg merchants who lived there at that time. The baptismal font is reminiscent of a seashell and supported by three baptism angels.\n\nThe altar is 20 meters tall and was built from costly marble in 1910. The altar features three sections illustrating key scenes from the life of Jesus Christ. The central image portrays the Resurrection of Jesus and, below it, a relief depicts the Last Supper. Above the central image, there is a large crucifix.\nLocated at the very top, the altar crown takes the form of a dove as a symbol of the Holy Spirit and is surrounded by a radiant circle. To the right and left of the radiant circle, two angels are kneeling and bowing their heads.\n\nIn the church crypt, there are 2,425 people interred, including Johann Mattheson and Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. The grave chambers are deeply excavated for four coffins above the other. During the French occupation of Hamburg in 1813, burials were banned within the city and therefore also in the crypt.\nIn 2004, some of the graves were opened and documented by scientists. In the process, they found some less well-preserved coffins and several intact coffins containing skeletal remains and well-preserved garments and textile upholstery. In the 18th and 19th centuries, wealthy families in Hamburg, fraternities, government offices and those with the benefit of burial funds acquired graves here.\nWell-preserved coffin carts can still be found in the crypt today. In the days when people were still buried in the crypt, the carts were used to transport the coffins.\nDuring the Second World War, the crypt was used as a shelter. In early 2000, the crypt was renovated and is now used for church services and concerts.\n\nThe church is the seat of one of the three bishops of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany.\n\n\n\n"}

She co-founded and was the first Prioress General of the Congregation of Dominican Missionary Sisters of the Rosary, which she helped to found in Peru.\n\nShe was born Florentina Nicol y Goñi on 14 March 1868 in Tafalla, Navarre, the youngest of the four daughters of Juan Nicol y Zalduendo, a shopkeeper specializing in farming items, and of Águeda Goñi y Vidal, who died in 1872. As a child, she had many duties, including helping her family with the household chores. In 1878 a cousin of her father, who was a cloistered Carmelite nun, offered to educate his middle two daughters at the boarding school of her monastery, the oldest having already married. Agreeing, he sent the girls to study. They later entered the monastic community themselves as Carmelite nuns.\n\nIn December 1881 Nicol was enrolled by her father at the boarding school of the Beaterio (Convent) of Santa Rosa in Huesca, a religious community of cloistered Sisters of the Third Order of St. Dominic, which was considered a prestigious school in the region. It was there that she was able to experience for herself the religious life, which raised questions in her mind about her future. Her father and stepmother withdrew her from the school in February 1883, considering that she had received sufficient education for a female. During that time, however, she had felt called to join the Dominican Sisters who had taught her, but she returned home to reflect on her choices.\n\nBy the following October Nicol had received the permission of her father to enter the convent. He then took her back to Huesca, where they visited her two sisters who were Carmelite nuns, after which she entered the novitiate of the beaterio. In 1886 she professed religious vows, taking the religious name of Mary Ascension of the Sacred Heart. She then became a teacher at that school and served in that capacity for the next 27 years. Under the anti-clerical laws promulgated in the early 20th century, however, the Spanish government took over the school and expelled the Sisters in 1913.\n\nDeprived of their traditional ministry, the Sisters decided to act on a proposal they had long considered, namely, missionary service, about which they had learned from the periodicals issued by various missionary congregations. They wrote to ecclesiastical authorities in both America and the Philippines, seeking a field where they could help the poorest of the poor. The response came from the friar Ramón Zubieta, a former missionary in the Philippines who had just been appointed by the Holy See as the Apostolic Vicar of a new Vicariate in the Peruvian amazons. The friar had traveled to Rome for his consecration as a bishop. After his stay in Rome, he stopped in Huesca to speak with the Sisters to see if he would be able to get some of the community to help in his new responsibility. Five of the Sisters who volunteered for this mission were chosen, and Nicol was chosen to lead them.\n\nThe five Dominican Sisters left Huesca during November 1913, accompanied by the bishop and three other friars who were to serve his territory, landing in Peru at the Port of Callao on 30 December 1913. When they arrived in Lima, they were given hospitality by the Dominican Sisters of the convent at the Shrine of Our Lady of the Patronage (), of which they took possession the following year. After a two-year period of cultural acclimation and preparation for the mission, Nicol set off in 1915 with two other Sisters for their final destination in the mountain forests. After a journey of 24 days crossing the Andes to a region where white women had never before traveled, they arrived in Puerto Maldonado, a small village in the Amazon basin, situated between two large rivers, the Madre de Dios and the Tambopata, along which all communication took place.\n\nWithin three days of their arrival, the Sisters began teaching the girls of the region and started the construction of a school. Soon girls from the indigenous Baraya tribe starting coming from the forest to receive the education they offered. Nicol made it clear that they would be welcome in their classrooms. This was despite the hostility of the white plantation workers who formed the population of the town.\n\nThe lack of any organized health care led the poor and the sick to come to the Sisters for care. The Sisters responded to this need, caring for them in their own convent, when necessary. They began to visit the sick in their homes, and provide whatever rudimentary care they could. Eventually, the Sisters would expand into medical care as a new apostolate. This pattern was repeated as other communities of Sisters were established in the region.\n\nIn 1917 the Catholic Church established a new Code of Canon Law, which was the first organized juridical codification of the regulations for many aspects of the church's life and functioning. One of the effects was reinforcing the separation of cloistered communities. These new regulations would have severely hampered the work the nuns were undertaking. At the recommendation of the Master of the Order of Preachers, Ludwig Theissling, who was visiting Peru, the Sisters, under the auspices of Bishop Zubieta, decided to separate from the monastic community from which they had come and to form a new and independent congregation of Religious Sisters of the Dominican Third Order Regular.\n\nThe new congregation was formally established on 5 October 1918 at the Convent of Our Lady of the Patronage in Lima. Nicol was elected as the first Prioress General of the congregation, and served in that office the rest of her life. She also served as the Mistress of novices, training the candidates to the congregation at their novitiate in Spain. During her generalship, she led her Sisters to establish themselves in other countries. In 1932 she led the founding community to mainland China, establishing what is to be the nucleus of their presence in Asia. She also established her congregation in Spain where they were able to recruit and form many missionary vocations. The General Motherhouse of the congregation was established in Pamplona, Navarre, Spain, and became her base.\n\nBy 1938 Nicol increasingly frail and wanted to retire to prepare herself for her final days. Nevertheless, she accepted her unanimous re-election for a third term as Prioress General at the congregation's General Chapter of 1939. She died on 24 February 1940.\n\nToday the congregation has 785 Sisters serving in 21 nations on five continents. Its General Motherhouse is now in Madrid, Spain. Among its members, the congregation counts four Sisters who are considered to be martyrs for the faith, having been tortured and murdered in the former Republic of the Congo on 25 November 1964, in the course of the Simba Rebellion, after they refused to leave the patients in their hospital.\n\nThe formal process for the canonization of Nicol was opened in Pamplona in September 1962. Pope John Paul II declared her Venerable in 2003. The following year a miracle was declared to have taken place through her intercession, due to which Pope Benedict XVI authorized the process to proceed. Thus, on 15 May 2005, in St. Peter's Square, Nicol was beatified in a ceremony presided over by Cardinal José Saraiva Martins. She was beatified along with another missionary religious sister, Marianne Cope, who worked among the lepers of Molokai, Hawaii.\n\n"}

A waffle or bagel (with a large enough hole) can also be substituted for the slice of bread.\n\nVariant names for the dish include \"bullseye eggs\", \"eggs in a frame\", \"egg in a hole\", \"gashouse eggs\", \"gasthaus eggs\", \"hole in one\", \"one-eyed Jack\", \"one-eyed Pete\", \"pirate's eye\" and \"popeye\". The name \"Gashouse Special\" is used in the 1975 book \"The Kids' Kitchen Takeover\" by Sarah Stein. The name \"toad in the hole\" is sometimes used for this dish, though more commonly refers to sausages cooked in Yorkshire pudding batter.\n\nThe dish is typically bread with an egg in the center and then cooked with a little butter or oil.\n\nIt is commonly prepared by cutting a circular or square hole in the center of a piece of bread. The bread, sometimes buttered prior to cooking, is fried in a pan with butter, margarine, cooking oil, or other fat. When browned, the bread is flipped, and the egg is cracked into the \"basket\" cut into the toast. Alternatively, the egg may be dropped into the bread before the bread is browned. The time the egg is placed in the bread is dependent on desired consistency.\n\nThe dish is often either covered or flipped while cooking to obtain even cooking, and requires a degree of skill and temperature control to prevent burning either the egg or bread while the entire dish is cooked to the desired consistency.\n\nThe dish is prepared by actor Guy Kibbee in the 1935 Warner Bros film \"Mary Jane's Pa\", leading to it sometimes being known as \"Guy Kibbee eggs\". It is also called \"Betty Grable eggs\", from the actress’ preparation of \"gashouse eggs\" in the 1941 film \"Moon Over Miami\".

Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or hydrogen.\n\nThe most common commercially available FFV in the world market is the ethanol flexible-fuel vehicle, with about 60 million automobiles, motorcycles and light duty trucks manufactured and sold worldwide by March 2018, and concentrated in four markets, Brazil (30.5 million light-duty vehicles and over 6 million motorcycles), the United States (21 million by the end of 2017), Canada (1.6 million by 2014), and Europe, led by Sweden (243,100). In addition to flex-fuel vehicles running with ethanol, in Europe and the US, mainly in California, there have been successful test programs with methanol flex-fuel vehicles, known as M85 flex-fuel vehicles. There have been also successful tests using P-series fuels with E85 flex fuel vehicles, but as of June 2008, this fuel is not yet available to the general public. These successful tests with P-series fuels were conducted on Ford Taurus and Dodge Caravan flexible-fuel vehicles.\n\nThough technology exists to allow ethanol FFVs to run on any mixture of gasoline and ethanol, from pure gasoline up to 100% ethanol (E100), North American and European flex-fuel vehicles are optimized to run on E85, a blend of 85% anhydrous ethanol fuel with 15% gasoline. This upper limit in the ethanol content is set to reduce ethanol emissions at low temperatures and to avoid cold starting problems during cold weather, at temperatures lower than . The alcohol content is reduced during the winter in regions where temperatures fall below to a winter blend of E70 in the U.S. or to E75 in Sweden from November until March. Brazilian flex fuel vehicles are optimized to run on any mix of E20-E25 gasoline and up to 100% hydrous ethanol fuel (E100). The Brazilian flex vehicles are built-in with a small gasoline reservoir for cold starting the engine when temperatures drop below . An improved flex motor generation was launched in 2009 which eliminated the need for the secondary gas tank.\n\nAs ethanol FFVs became commercially available during the late 1990s, the common use of the term \"flexible-fuel vehicle\" became synonymous with ethanol FFVs. In the United States flex-fuel vehicles are also known as \"E85 vehicles\". In Brazil, the FFVs are popularly known as \"total flex\" or simply \"flex\" cars. In Europe, FFVs are also known as \"flexifuel\" vehicles. Automakers, particularly in Brazil and the European market, use badging in their FFV models with the some variant of the word \"flex\", such as Volvo \"Flexifuel\", or Volkswagen \"Total Flex\", or Chevrolet \"FlexPower\" or Renault \"Hi-Flex\", and Ford sells its Focus model in Europe as \"Flexifuel\" and as \"Flex\" in Brazil. In the US, only since 2008 FFV models feature a yellow gas cap with the label \"E85/Gasoline\" written on the top of the cap to differentiate E85s from gasoline only models.\n\nFlexible-fuel vehicles (FFVs) are based on dual-fuel systems that supply both fuels into the combustion chamber at the same time in various calibrated proportions. The most common fuels used by FFVs today are unleaded gasoline and ethanol fuel. Ethanol FFVs can run on pure gasoline, pure ethanol (E100) or any combination of both. Methanol has also been blended with gasoline in flex-fuel vehicles known as M85 FFVs, but their use has been limited mainly to demonstration projects and small government fleets, particularly in California.\n\nThe Ford Model T, produced from 1908 through 1927, was fitted with a carburetor with adjustable jetting, allowing use of ethanol, gasoline or kerosene (each by itself), or a combination of the first two mentioned fuels. Other car manufactures also provided engines for ethanol fuel use. Henry Ford continued to advocate for ethanol as fuel even during Prohibition. However, cheaper oil caused gasoline to prevail, until the 1973 oil crisis resulted in gasoline shortages and awareness on the dangers of oil dependence. This crisis opened a new opportunity for ethanol and other alternative fuels, such as methanol, gaseous fuels such as CNG and LPG, and also hydrogen. Ethanol, methanol and natural gas CNG were the three alternative fuels that received more attention for research and development, and government support.\n\nSince 1975, and as a response to the shock caused by the first oil crisis, the Brazilian government implemented the National Alcohol Program -Pró-Álcool- (), a nationwide program financed by the government to phase out automotive fuels derived from fossil fuels in favor of ethanol made from sugar cane. It began with a low blend of anhydrous alcohol with regular gasoline in 1976, and since July 2007 the mandatory blend is 25% of alcohol or gasohol E25. In 1979, and as a response to the second oil crisis, the first vehicle capable of running with pure hydrous ethanol (E100) was launched to the market, the Fiat 147, after testing with several prototypes developed by Fiat, Volkswagen, GM and Ford. The Brazilian government provided three important initial drivers for the ethanol industry: guaranteed purchases by the state-owned oil company Petrobras, low-interest loans for agro-industrial ethanol firms, and fixed gasoline and ethanol prices. After reaching more than 4 million cars and light trucks running on pure ethanol by the late 1980s, the use of E100-only vehicles sharply declined after increases in sugar prices produced shortages of ethanol fuel.\n\nAfter extensive research that began in the 90s, a second push took place in March 2003, when the Brazilian subsidiary of Volkswagen launched to the market the first full flexible-fuel car, the Gol 1.6 Total Flex. Several months later was followed by other Brazilian automakers, and by 2010 General Motors, Fiat, Ford, Peugeot, Renault, Volkswagen, Honda, Mitsubishi, Toyota, Citroën, Nissan and Kia Motors were producing popular models of flex cars and light trucks. The adoption of ethanol flex fuel vehicles was so successful, that production of flex cars went from almost 40 thousand in 2003 to 1.7 million in 2007. This rapid adoption of the flex technology was facilitated by the fuel distribution infrastructure already in place, as around 27,000 filling stations countrywide were available by 1997 with at least one ethanol pump, a heritage of the \"Pró-Álcool\" program.\n\nIn the United States, initial support to develop alternative fuels by the government was also a response to the first oil crisis, and some time later, as a goal to improve air quality. Also, liquid fuels were preferred over gaseous fuels not only because they have a better volumetric energy density but also because they were the most compatible fuels with existing distribution systems and engines, thus avoiding a big departure from the existing technologies and taking advantage of the vehicle and the refueling infrastructure. California led the search of sustainable alternatives with interest focused in methanol. Ford Motor Company and other automakers responded to California's request for vehicles that run on methanol. In 1981, Ford delivered 40 dedicated methanol fuel (M100) Escorts to Los Angeles County, but only four refueling stations were installed. The biggest challenge in the development of alcohol vehicle technology was getting all of the fuel system materials compatible with the higher chemical reactivity of the fuel. Methanol was even more of a challenge than ethanol but much of the early experience gained with neat ethanol vehicle production in Brazil was transferable to methanol. The success of this small experimental fleet of M100s led California to request more of these vehicles, mainly for government fleets. In 1983, Ford built 582 M100 vehicles; 501 went to California, and the remaining to New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, and Canada.\nAs an answer to the lack of refueling infrastructure, Ford began development of a flexible-fuel vehicle in 1982, and between 1985 and 1992, 705 experimental FFVs were built and delivered to California and Canada, including the 1.6L Ford Escort, the 3.0L Taurus, and the 5.0L LTD Crown Victoria. These vehicles could operate on either gasoline or methanol with only one fuel system. Legislation was passed to encourage the US auto industry to begin production, which started in 1993 for the M85 FFVs at Ford. In 1996, a new FFV Ford Taurus was developed, with models fully capable of running on either methanol or ethanol blended with gasoline. This ethanol version of the Taurus became the first commercial production of an E85 FFV. The momentum of the FFV production programs at the American car companies continued, although by the end of the 1990s, the emphasis shifted to the FFV E85 version, as it is today. Ethanol was preferred over methanol because there is a large support from the farming community, and thanks to the government's incentive programs and corn-based ethanol subsidies available at the time. Sweden also tested both the M85 and the E85 flexifuel vehicles, but due to agriculture policy, in the end emphasis was given to the ethanol flexifuel vehicles. Support for ethanol also comes from the fact that it is a biomass fuel, which addresses climate change concerns and greenhouse gas emissions, though nowadays these benefits are questioned and depend on the feedstock used for ethanol production and their indirect land use change impacts.\n\nThe demand for ethanol fuel produced from field corn in the United States was stimulated by the discovery in the late 90s that methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), an oxygenate additive in gasoline, was contaminating groundwater. Due to the risks of widespread and costly litigation, and because MTBE use in gasoline was banned in almost 20 states by 2006, the substitution of MTBE opened a new market for ethanol fuel. This demand shift for ethanol as an oxygenate additive took place at a time when oil prices were already significantly rising. By 2006, about 50 percent of the gasoline used in the U.S. contained ethanol at different proportions, and ethanol production grew so fast that the US became the world's top ethanol producer, overtaking Brazil in 2005. This shift also contributed to a sharp increase in the production and sale of E85 flex vehicles since 2002.\n\nFlexible-fuel technology started being developed by Brazilian engineers near the end of the 1990s. The Brazilian flexible fuel car is built with an ethanol-ready engine and one fuel tank for both fuels. The small gasoline reservoir for starting the engine in cold weather, used in earlier neat ethanol vehicles, was kept to avoid start up problems in the central and southern regions, where winter temperatures normally drop below . An improved flex motor generation was launched in 2009 and allowed to eliminate the need for this secondary gas reservoir tank. Another improvement was the reduction of fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions, between 10% to 15% as compared to flex motors sold in 2008. In March 2009 Volkswagen do Brasil launched the Polo E-Flex, the first flex fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start.\n\nA key innovation in the Brazilian flex technology was avoiding the need for an additional dedicated sensor to monitor the ethanol-gasoline mix, which made the first American M85 flex fuel vehicles too expensive.\n\nBrazilian flex cars are capable of running on just hydrated ethanol (E100), or just on a blend of gasoline with 25 to 27% anhydrous ethanol (the mandatory blend), or on any arbitrary combination of both fuels.\n\nThe flexibility of Brazilian FFVs empowers the consumers to choose the fuel depending on current market prices. As ethanol fuel economy is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline, flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of ethanol fuel. As a rule of thumb, Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests.\n\nIn March 2003 Volkswagen do Brasil launched in the market the Gol 1.6 Total Flex, the first commercial flexible fuel vehicle capable of running on any blend of gasoline and ethanol. GM do Brasil followed three months later with the Chevrolet Corsa 1.8 Flexpower, using an engine developed by a joint-venture with Fiat called PowerTrain. Passenger flex-fuel vehicles became a commercial success in the country, and , a total of 15 car manufacturers produce flex-fuel engines for the Brazilian market, dominating all light vehicle segments except sports cars, off-road vehicles and minivans.\n\nThe production of flex-fuel cars and light commercial vehicles since 2003 reached the milestone of 10 million vehicles in March 2010. At the end of 2012 registrations of flex-fuel cars and light trucks represented 87% of all passenger and light duty vehicles sold in the country in 2012, and climbed to a 94% market share of all new passenger vehicles sales in 2013. Production passed the 20 million-unit mark in June 2013. \n\nBy the end of 2014, flex-fuel cars represented 54% of the Brazilian registered stock of light-duty vehicles, while gasoline only vehicles represented 34.3%. , flex-fuel light-duty vehicle sales totaled 25.5 million units. The market share of flex vehicles reached 88.6% of all light-duty registrations in 2017. , fifteen years after the launch of the first flex fuel car, there were 30.5 million flex cars and light trucks registered in the country, and 6 million flex motorcycles.\n\nThe rapid success of flex vehicles was made possible by the existence of 33,000 filling stations with at least one ethanol pump available by 2006, a heritage of the early \"Pró-Álcool\" ethanol program. These facts, together with the mandatory use of E25 blend of gasoline throughout the country, allowed Brazil in 2008 to achieve more than 50% of fuel consumption in the gasoline market from sugar cane-based ethanol.\n\nAccording to two separate research studies conducted in 2009, at the national level 65% of the flex-fuel registered vehicles regularly used ethanol fuel, and the usage climbed to 93% in São Paulo, the main ethanol producer state where local taxes are lower, and prices at the pump are more competitive than gasoline. However, as a result of higher ethanol prices caused by the Brazilian ethanol industry crisis that began in 2009, combined with government subsidies to keep gasoline price lower than the international market value, by November 2013 only 23% flex-fuel car owners were using ethanol, down from 66% in 2009.\n\nOne of the latest innovation within the Brazilian flexible-fuel technology is the development of flex-fuel motorcycles. The first flex-fuel motorcycle was launched by Honda in March 2009, the CG 150 Titan Mix. In September 2009, Honda launched a second flexible-fuel motorcycle, the on-off-road NXR 150 Bros Mix. By December 2012 the five available models of flexible-fuel motorcycles from Honda and Yamaha reached a cumulative production of 2,291,072 units, representing 31.8% of all motorcycles manufactured in Brazil since 2009, and 48.2% of motorcycle production in 2012. Flexible-fuel motorcycle production passed the 3 million-unit milestone in October 2013. The 4 million mark was reached in March 2015.\n\nFlexible-fuel vehicles were introduced in Sweden as a demonstration test in 1994, when three Ford Taurus were imported to show the technology existed. Because of the existing interest, a project was started in 1995 with 50 Ford Taurus E85 flexifuel in different parts of Sweden: Umeå, Örnsköldsvik, Härnösand, Stockholm, Karlstad, Linköping, and Växjö. From 1997 to 1998 an additional 300 Taurus were imported, and the number of E85 fueling grew to 40. Then in 1998 the city of Stockholm placed an order for 2,000 of FFVs for any car manufacturer willing to produce them. The objective was to jump-start the FFV industry in Sweden. The two domestic car makers Volvo Group and Saab AB refused to participate arguing there were not in place any ethanol filling stations. However, Ford Motor Company took the offer and began importing the flexifuel version of its Focus model, delivering the first cars in 2001, and selling more than 15,000 FFV Focus by 2005, then representing an 80% market share of the flexifuel market.\n\nIn 2005 both Volvo and Saab introduced to the Sweden market their flexifuel models. Saab began selling its 9-5 2.0 Biopower, joined in 2006 by its 9-5 2.3 Biopower. Volvo introduced its S40 and V50 with flexible-fuel engines, joined in late 2006 by the new C30. All Volvo models were initially restricted to the Sweden market, until 2007, when these three models were launched in eight new European markets. In 2007, Saab also started selling a BioPower version of its popular Saab 9-3 line. In 2008 the Saab-derived Cadillac BLS was introduced with E85 compatible engines, and Volvo launched the V70 with a 2.5-litre turbocharged Flexifuel engine.\n\nAll flexible-fuel vehicles in Sweden use an E75 winter blend instead of E85 to avoid engine starting problems during cold weather. This blend was introduced since the winter 2006-07 and E75 is used from November until March. For temperature below E85 flex vehicles require an engine block heater. The use of this device is also recommended for gasoline vehicles when temperatures drop below . Another option when extreme cold weather is expected is to add more pure gasoline in the tank, thus reducing the ethanol content below the E75 winter blend, or simply not to use E85 during extreme low temperature spells.\n\nSweden has achieved the largest E85 flexible-fuel vehicle fleet in Europe, with a sharp growth from 717 vehicles in 2001 to 243,136 through December 2014. As of 2008 a total of 70% of all flexifuel vehicles operating in the EU were registered in Sweden. The recent and accelerated growth of the Swedish fleet of E85 flexifuel vehicles is the result of the National Climate Policy in Global Cooperation Bill passed in 2005, which not only ratified the Kyoto Protocol but also sought to meet the 2003 EU Biofuels Directive regarding targets for use of biofuels, and also let to the 2006 government's commitment to eliminate oil imports by 2020.\n\nIn order to achieve these goals several government incentives were implemented. Ethanol, as the other biofuels, was exempted of both, the CO and energy taxes until 2009, resulting in a 30% price reduction at the pump of E85 fuel over gasoline. Furthermore, other demand side incentives for flexifuel vehicle owners include a bonus to buyers of FFVs, exemption from the Stockholm congestion tax, up to 20% discount on auto insurance, free parking spaces in most of the largest cities, owner annual registration taxes, and a 20% tax reduction for flexifuel company cars. Also, a part of the program, the Swedish Government ruled that 25% of their vehicle purchases (excluding police, fire and ambulance vehicles) must be alternative fuel vehicles. By the first months of 2008, this package of incentives resulted in sales of flexible-fuel cars representing 25% of new car sales.\n\nOn the supply side, since 2005 the gasoline fuelling stations selling more than 3 million liters of fuel a year are required to sell at least one type of biofuel, resulting in more than 1,200 gas stations selling E85 by August 2008. Despite all the sharp growth of E85 flexifuel cars, by 2007 they represented just two percent of the four million Swedish vehicles. In addition, this law also mandated all new filling stations to offer alternative fuels, and stations with an annual volume of more than one million liters are required to have an alternative fuel pump by December 2009. Therefore, the number of E85 pumps is expected to reach by 2009 nearly 60% of Sweden's 4,000 filling stations.\n\nThe Swedish-made Koenigsegg Jesko 300, the low downforce version of the Koenigsegg Jesko, is currently the fastest and most powerful flexible fuel vehicle with its turbocharged V8 producing over 1600 hp when running on biofuel, as compared to 1280 hp on 95 octane unleaded gasoline.\n\nFlexifuel vehicles are sold in 18 European countries, including Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Ford, Volvo and Saab are the main automakers offering flexifuel autos in the region.\n\nBiofuel cars in general get strong tax incentives in France, including a 0 or 50% reduction on the tax on new vehicles, and a 40% reduction on CO tax for new cars. For company cars there is a corporate car tax free for 2 years and a recovery of 80% of the value added tax (VAT) on E85 vehicles. Also, E85 fuel price is set significantly lower than diesel or gasoline, resulting in E85 at € 0.80, diesel at €1.15, and gasoline at €1.30 per liter, as of April 2007. By May 2008, France had 211 pumps selling E85, even though the government made plans for the installation of up to 500 E85 pumps by year end 2007. French automakers Renault and PSA (Citroen & Peugeot) announced they will start selling FFV cars beginning in the summer 2007.\n\nBiofuel emphasis in Germany is on biodiesel, and no specific incentives have been granted for E85 flex-fuel cars, however there is complete exemption of taxes on all biofuels while there is a normal tax of €0.65 per liter of petroleum fuels. The distribution of E85 began in 2005, and with 219 stations as of September 2008, Germany ranks second after Sweden with the most E85 fueling stations in the EU.\nAs of July 2012 retail prices of E85 was €1.09 per liter, and gasoline was priced at €1.60 per liter (for gasoline RON 95), then providing enough margin to compensate for ethanol's lower fuel economy.\nFord has offered the Ford Focus since August 2005 in Germany. Ford is about to offer also the Mondeo and other models as FFV versions between 2008 and 2010. The Saab 9-5 and Saab 9-3 Biopower, the Peugeot 308 Bioflex, the Citroën C4 Bioflex, the Audi A5, two models of the Cadillac BLS, and five Volvo models are also available in the German market by 2008. Since 2011, Dacia offers the Logan MCV with a 1.6l 16v flexfuel engine.\n\nIreland is the third best seller European market of E85 flex-fuel vehicles, after Sweden and France. Bioethanol (E85) in Ireland is made from whey, a waste product of cheese manufacturing. The Irish government established several incentives, including a 50% discount in vehicle registration taxes (VRT), which can account for more than one third of the retail price of a new car in Ireland (around €6,500). The bioethanol element of the E85 fuel is excise-free for fuel companies, allowing retail prices to be low enough to offset the 25 per cent cut in fuel economy that E-85 cars offer, due to ethanol's lower energy content than gasoline. Also, the value added tax (VAT) on the fuel can also be claimed back. E-85 fuel is available across the country in more than 20 of Maxol service stations. In October 2005, the 1.8 Ford Focus FFV became the first flexible-fuel vehicle to be commercially sold in Ireland. Later Ford launched the C-max and the Mondeo flexifuel models. Saab and Volvo also have E85 models available.\nFrom 1 January 2011 E85 fuel is no longer excise-free in Ireland. Maxol has announced they will not provide E85 when their current supplies have run out.\n\nThe first flexifuel vehicles were introduced in Spain by late 2007, with the acquisition of 80 cars for use in the Spaniard official government fleet. At that time the country had only three gas stations selling E85, making necessary to deploy an official E85 fueling station in Madrid to attend these vehicles. Despite the introduction in the Spaniard market of several flexifuel models, by the end of 2008 still persists the problems of adequate E85 fueling infrastructure, as only 10 gas stations were selling E85 fuel to the public in the entire country.\n\nThe UK government established several incentives for E85 flex-fuel vehicles. These include a fuel duty rebate on E85 fuel of 20 p per liter, until 2010; a £ 10 to 15 reduction in the vehicle excise duty (VED); and a 2% annual company car tax discount for flex-fuel cars. Despite the small number of E85 pump stations available, limited to the Morrisons supermarket chain stations, most automakers offer the same models in the UK that are available in the European market. In 2005 the Ford Focus Flexi-Fuel became the first flexible-fuel car sold in the UK, though E85 pumps were not opened until 2006. Volvo now offers its flexifuel models S80, S40, C30, V50 and V70. Other models available in the UK are the Ford C-Max Flexi-Fuel, and the Saab models 9-5 and 9-3 Flex-Fuel Biopower, and the new Saab Aero X BioPower E100 bioethanol. Despite being introduced around a decade ago, E85 is no longer commercially available in the UK\n\n, there were more than 21 million E85 flex-fuel vehicles in the United States, up from about 11 million flex-fuel cars and light trucks in operation as of early 2013. The number of flex-fuel vehicles on U.S roads increased from 1.4 million in 2001, to 4.1 million in 2005, and rose to 7.3 million in 2008. \n\nFor the 2011 model year there are about 70 vehicles E85 capable, including sedans, vans, SUVs and pick-up trucks. Many of the models available in the market are trucks and sport-utility vehicles getting less than when filled with gasoline. Actual consumption of E85 among flex-fuel vehicle owners is limited. Nevertheless, the U.S. Department of Energy estimated that in 2011 only 862,837 flex-fuel fleet-operated vehicles were regularly fueled with E85. As a result, from all the ethanol fuel consumed in the country in 2009, only 1% was E85 consumed by flex-fuel vehicles.\n\nThe E85 blend is used in gasoline engines modified to accept such higher concentrations of ethanol, and the fuel injection is regulated through a dedicated sensor, which automatically detects the amount of ethanol in the fuel, allowing to adjust both fuel injection and spark timing accordingly to the actual blend available in the vehicle's tank. Because ethanol contains close to 34% less energy per unit volume than gasoline, E85 FFVs have a lower mileage per gallon than gasoline. Based on EPA tests for all 2006 E85 models, the average fuel economy for E85 vehicles was 25.56% lower than unleaded gasoline.\n\nThe American E85 flex-fuel vehicle was developed to run on any mixture of unleaded gasoline and ethanol, anywhere from 0% to 85% ethanol by volume. Both fuels are mixed in the same tank, and E85 is sold already blended. In order to reduce ethanol evaporative emissions and to avoid problems starting the engine during cold weather, the maximum blend of ethanol was set to 85%. There is also a seasonal reduction of the ethanol content to E70 (called winter E85 blend) in very cold regions, where temperatures fall below during the winter. In Wyoming for example, E70 is sold as E85 from October to May.\n\nE85 flex-fuel vehicles are becoming increasingly common in the Midwest, where corn is a major crop and is the primary feedstock for ethanol fuel production. Regional retail E85 prices vary widely across the US, with more favorable prices in the Midwest region, where most corn is grown and ethanol produced. Depending of the vehicle capabilities, the break-even price of E85 has to be between 25 and 30% lower than gasoline.\n\nA 2005 survey found that 68% of American flex-fuel car owners were not aware they owned an E85 flex. This was because the exteriors of flex and non-flex vehicles look exactly the same; there is no sale price difference between them; the lack of consumers' awareness about E85s; and also the initial decision of American automakers of not putting any kind of exterior labeling, so buyers could be unaware they are purchasing an E85 vehicle. Since 2008, all new FFV models in the US feature a bright yellow gas cap to remind drivers of the E85 capabilities and proper flex-fuel badging.\n\nSome critics have argued that American automakers have been producing E85 flex models motivated by a loophole in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements, that allows for a fuel economy credit for every flex-fuel vehicle sold, whether or not in practice these vehicles are fueled with E85. This loophole might allow the car industry to meet the CAFE targets in fuel economy just by spending between and that it cost to turn a conventional vehicle into a flex-fuel, without investing in new technology to improve fuel economy, and saving them the potential fines for not achieving that standard in a given model year. The CAFE standards proposed in 2011 for the period 2017-2025 will allow flexible-fuel vehicles to receive extra credit but only when the carmakers present data proving how much E85 such vehicles have actually consumed.\n\nA major restriction hampering sales of E85 flex vehicles, or fueling with E85, is the limited infrastructure available to sell E85 to the public with only 2% of the motor fuel stations offering E85 by March 2014. , there were only 3,218 fueling stations selling E85 to the public in the entire U.S., while about 156,000 retail motor fuel outlets do not offer any ethanol blend. In addition, there has been a great concentration of E85 stations in the Corn Belt states. The main constraint for a more rapid expansion of E85 availability is that it requires dedicated storage tanks at filling stations, at an estimated cost of for each dedicated ethanol tank. The Obama Administration set the goal of installing 10,000 blender pumps nationwide until 2015, and to support this target the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued a rule in May 2011 to include flexible fuel pumps in the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). This ruling will provide financial assistance to fuel station owners to install E85 and blender pumps.\n\nA flex fuel conversion kit is a kit that allows a conventional equipment manufactured vehicle to be altered to operate on propane, natural gas, methane gas, ethanol, or electricity are classified as aftermarket AFV conversions. All vehicle conversions, except those that are completed for a vehicle to run on electricity, must meet current applicable U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards.\n\nIn 2008, Ford delivered the first flex-fuel plug-in hybrid as part of a demonstration project, a Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid capable of running on E85 or gasoline. General Motors announced that the new Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, launched in the United States market in December 2010, would be flex-fuel-capable in 2013. General Motors do Brasil announced that it will import from five to ten Volts to Brazil during the first semester of 2011 as part of a demonstration and also to lobby the federal government to enact financial incentives for green cars. If successful, GM would adapt the Volt to operate on ethanol fuel, as most new cars sold in Brazil are flex-fuel.\n\nIn 2008, Chrysler, General Motors, and Ford pledged to manufacture 50 percent of their entire vehicle line as flexible fuel in model year 2012, if enough fueling infrastructure develops. The Open Fuel Standard Act (OFS), introduced to Congress in May 2011, is intended to promote a massive adoption of flex-fuel vehicles capable of running on ethanol or methanol. The bill requires that 50 percent of automobiles made in 2014, 80 percent in 2016, and 95 percent in 2017, would be manufactured and warranted to operate on non-petroleum-based fuels, which includes existing technologies such as flex-fuel, natural gas, hydrogen, biodiesel, plug-in electric and fuel cell.\n\n, almost half of new vehicles produced by Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors are flex-fuel, meaning roughly one-quarter of all new vehicles sold by 2015 are capable of using up to E85. However, obstacles to widespread use of E85 fuel remain. A 2014 analysis by the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) found that oil companies prevent or discourage affiliated retailers from selling E85 through rigid franchise and branding agreements, restrictive supply contracts, and other tactics. The report showed independent retailers are five times more likely to offer E85 than retailers carrying an oil company brand.\n\nIn January 2007 GM brought UK-sourced Saab 9-5 Biopower E85 flex-fuel vehicles to Australia as a trial, in order to measure interest in ethanol-powered vehicles in the country. Saab Australia placed the vehicles with the fleets of the Queensland Government, the media, and some ethanol producers. E85 is not available widely in Australia, but the Manildra Group provided the E85 blend fuel for this trial.\n\nSaab Australia became the first car maker to produce an E85 flex-fuel car for the Australian market with the Saab 9-5 BioPower. One month later launched the new 9-3 BioPower, the first vehicle in Australia to give drivers a choice of three fuels, E85, diesel or gasoline, and both automobiles are sold for a small premium. Australia's largest independent fuel retailer, United Petroleum, announced plans to install Australia's first commercial E85 fuel pumps, one in Sydney and one in Melbourne.\n\nGM Holden, the Victorian state government, Coskata, Caltex, Veolia Environmental Services and Mitsui have announced a consortium with a co-ordinated plan to build a bio-ethanol plant from household waste for use as E85 fuel. In August 2010 Caltex launched the E85 ethanol fuel called Bio E-Flex, designed for use in the Holden Commodore VE Series II flex-fuel vehicles to be released later in 2010. Caltex Australia plans to begin selling Bio E-Flex in Melbourne from September and expects to have Bio E-Flex available in more than 30 service stations in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Canberra by the end of October, with plans to increase to 100 metropolitan and regional locations in 2011.\n\nAs part of the North American auto market, by 2007 Canada had available 51 models of E85 flex-vehicles, most from Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, including automobiles, pickup trucks, and SUVs. The country had around 1.6 million capable flex fuel E85s on the roads by 2014. However, most users are not aware they own an E85, as vehicles are not clearly labeled as such, and even though the newer models have a yellow cap in the fuel tank informing that the vehicle can handle E85, most users are still not aware because there are very few gas stations offering E85. Another major drawback to greater E85 fuel use is the fact that by June 2008 Canada had only three public E85 pumps, all located in Ontario, in the cities of Guelph, Chatham, and Woodstock. E85 fueling is available primarily for fleet vehicles, including 20 government refueling stations not available for the public. The main feedstocks for E85 production in Canada are corn and wheat, and there were several proposals being discussed to increase the actual use of E85 fuel in FFVs, such as creating an ethanol-friendly highway or ethanol corridor.\n\nIn March 2009 the Colombian government enacted a mandate to introduce E85 flexible-fuel cars. The executive decree applies to all gasoline-powered vehicles with engines smaller than 2.0 liters manufactured, imported, and commercialized in the country beginning in 2012, mandating that 60% of such vehicles must have flex-fuel engines capable of running with gasoline or E85, or any blend of both. By 2014 the mandatory quota is 80% and it will reach 100 percent by 2016. All vehicles with engines bigger than 2.0 liters must be E85 capable starting in 2013. The decree also mandates that by 2011 all gasoline stations must provide infrastructure to guarantee availability of E85 throughout the country. The mandatory introduction of E85 flex-fuels has caused controversy among carmakers, car dealers, gasoline station owners, and even some ethanol producers complained the industry is not ready to supply enough ethanol for the new E85 fleet.\n\nIn 2006 New Zealand began a pilot project with two E85 Ford Focus Flexi-Fuel evaluation cars. The main feedstock used in New Zealand for ethanol production is whey, a by-product of milk production.\n\nGovernment officials and businessmen from Paraguay began negotiations in 2007 with Brazilian automakers in order to import flex cars that run on any blend of gasoline and ethanol. If successful, Paraguay would become the first destination for Brazilian flex-fuel car exports. In May 2008, the Paraguayan government announced a plan to eliminate import taxes of flex-fuel vehicles and an incentive program for ethanol production. The plan also includes the purchase of 20,000 flex cars in 2009 for the government fleet.\n\nIn 2006, tax incentives were established in Thailand for the introduction of compressed natural gas (CNG) as an alternative fuel, by eliminating import duties and lowering excise taxes on CNG-compatible cars. Then in 2007, Thai authorities approved incentives for the production of \"eco-cars\", with the goal of the country to become a regional hub for the production of small, affordable and fuel-efficient cars. Seven automakers joint in the program, Toyota, Suzuki, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Honda, Tata and Volkswagen. In 2008 the government announced priority for E85, expecting these flex-fuel vehicles to become widely available in Thailand in 2009, three years ahead of schedule. The incentives include cuts in excise tax rates for E85-compatible cars and reduction of corporate taxes for ethanol producers to make sure E85 fuel supply will be met. This new plan however, brought confusion and protests by the automakers which sign-up for the \"eco-cars\", as competition with the E85 flex-fuel cars will negatively affect their ongoing plans and investments, and their production lines will have to be upgraded at a high cost for them to produce flex-fuel cars. They also complained that flex-fuel vehicles popular in a few countries around the world, limiting their export potential as compared with other engine technologies.\n\nDespite the controversy, the first E85 flexible fuel vehicles were introduced in November 2008. The first two models available in the Thai market were the Volvo S80 and the C30. The S80 is manufactured locally and the C30 is imported. By the time of the introduction of flex vehicles there were already two gas stations with E85 fuel available. During 2009 it was expected that 15 fueling stations in Bangkok will have E85 fuel available. In October 2009 the Mitsubishi Lancer Ex was launched becoming the first mass-production E85 flexi-fuel vehicle produced in Thailand.\n\n\n\n"}

Their music captivated a young audience. The group was formed in 2003, after several rounds of tryouts for Fox Kids.\n\nIn the Netherlands, many radio stations did not play the Ch!pz' songs because most of the listeners found their songs too childish. However, thanks to promotions on Fox Kids, Ch!pz became one of the most well-known bands in the Netherlands. Within a year and a half, the band had three singles at the top of the Dutch singles charts. All of their singles went straight to the number one position, except \"Captain Hook\" and their debut single \"Ch!pz in Black\". Their debut album, \"The Adventures of Ch!pz\", was released in 2004 in the Netherlands, which went straight to number one in the Dutch album chart. In 2005, their second album, \"The World of Ch!pz\", was released. Singles from it include \"1001 Arabian Nights\"; \"One, Two, Three!\"; and \"Carnival\", all of which peaked at the number one position.\n\nAt the beginning of 2005, \"\"Ch!pz in Black\"\", the first single from Ch!pz, was released in Germany and climbed to the second position on the German charts. Shortly thereafter, at the beginning of May in 2005, their second single, \"\"Cowboy\"\", made it to the second position as well. A week later, the song made it all the way to the first position.\n\nTheir videos are all of the same style: The members of the band are in exotic surroundings, and they all wear similar styles of clothing (for example, in Ch!pz in Black, they all wear black outfits). As such, they overcome a horse thief in \"\"Cowboy\"\", aliens who kidnapped their fellow campers in \"\"Ch!pz in Black\"\", a magic lamp thief in \"1001 Arabian Nights\", and in \"One, Two, Three!\" they fight against their evil selves. All of this happens amidst clips of highly stylized dance moves, which inevitably defeats their enemies.\n\nIn April of 2006, they released a new single in the Netherlands, \"Gangstertown\". Two months after the release of the single, that peaked at number five in the Dutch Top 40, an EP was also released, \"\". A music video was shot for \"Waikiki Beach\" too, but was never released on the single. In late September, their latest single, \"One Day When I Grow Up\" was released. The single entered the Dutch charts at number 29 and climbed up to peak at number seven. A second EP, \"\", was released in November of 2006.\n\n\"Cowboy\" was released in the United Kingdom on February 12, 2007, while \"Ch!pz in Black\" is now slated for a March 26 release.\n\nIn December of 2007, they released a new song, \"Make a big splash\", entering at number three.\n\nAfter that, they made a TV programme named Chipz Dance Xperienz, in which they showed their choreographies. After that, to support the programme, in September of 2008, they released \"CDX\" (Chipz Dance Xperienz), their new CD, preceded by the single \"Dance Xperienz\".\n\nCh!pz continued to tour during 2009 and 2010, and their last concert was on November 27, 2010. During this time, plans for a new album, \"The New Adventures Of Ch!pz\", was being planned. A new single was also in the works.\n\nUnfortunately, the management didn’t think Ch!pz’ new album would be successful and instead decided to cancel the new releases. The members of Ch!pz attempted to gain rights to the Ch!pz name through legal battle but were unsuccessful.\n\nCh!pz disbanded following this, they officially disbanded on January 1, 2011, with the official announcement following on January 3, 2011.\n\nOn October 23, 2018, the group reunited with the same members as before. They have stated that they want to make a comeback in the music industry after an April fools joke that was well received by many fans.\n\nCh!pz made it's Hollywood debut with a song called \"Happy Song\", which was in an opening scene of a 2020 Pixar film, \"Onward\", which was released on March 6.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1905142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905142", "title": "Rover P4", "text": "Rover P4\n\nThe Rover P4 series is a group of mid-size luxury saloon cars produced by the Rover Company from 1949 until 1964. They were designed by Gordon Bashford.\n\nTheir P4 designation is factory terminology for this group of cars and was not in day-to-day use by ordinary owners who would have used the appropriate consumer designations for their models such as Rover 90 or Rover 100.\n\nProduction began in 1949 with the 6-cylinder 2.1-litre Rover 75. Four years later a 2-litre 4-cylinder Rover 60 was brought to the market to fit below the 75 and a 2.6-litre 6-cylinder Rover 90 to top the three-car range. Several variations followed.\n\nThese cars are very much part of British culture and became known as the 'Auntie' Rovers. They were driven by royalty including Grace Kelly.\n\nThe P4 series was supplemented in September 1958 by a new conservatively shaped Rover 3-litre P5 but the P4 series stayed in production until 1964 and their replacement by the Rover 2000.\n\nThe earlier cars used a Rover engine from the 1948 Rover 75. A four-speed manual transmission was used with a column-mounted gear change at first and floor-mounted unit from September 1953. At first the gearbox only had synchromesh on third and top but it was added to second gear as well in 1953. A freewheel clutch, a traditional Rover feature, was fitted to cars without overdrive until mid-1959, when it was removed from the specifications, shortly before the London Motor Show in October that year.\n\nThe cars had a separate chassis with independent suspension by coil springs at the front and a live axle with half-elliptical leaf springs at the rear. The brakes on early cars were operated by a hybrid hydro-mechanical system but became fully hydraulic in 1950. Girling disc brakes replaced drums at the front from October 1959.\n\nThe complete body shells were made by the Pressed Steel company and featured aluminium/magnesium alloy (Birmabright) doors, boot lid and bonnets. If the handle was not used to close them they were easily dented so for the final 95/110 models steel was used instead. The P4 series was one of the last UK cars to incorporate rear-hinged \"suicide\" doors.\nAnnounced by Managing Director Spencer Wilks on 23 September 1949 the new Rover 75, now the only Rover in production, was first displayed at the opening day of the Earls Court Motor Show on 28 September 1949. It featured unusual modern styling in stark contrast with the outdated Rover 75 (P3) it replaced. Gone were the traditional radiator, separate headlamps and external running boards. In their place were a chromium grille, recessed headlamps and a streamlined body the whole width of the chassis. A steering column-mounted gear lever was fitted.\n\nThe car's styling was derived from the then controversial 1947 s. The Rover executives purchased two such vehicles and fitted the body from one of them to a prototype P4 chassis to create a development mule. James Taylor's book 'Rover P4 – The Complete Story' says that this vehicle was affectionately known as the 'Roverbaker' hybrid.\n\nMalcolm Bobbit states \"The P4 set the seal on the future with a vengeance. Rover defied its critics with the P4's new look and to get some idea of the shock of the new, consider some of its rivals . . . astonishment at the P4's courageous styling.\" The P3 had almost no boot at all yet that had been considered rather more than adequate. The new car's bonnet-like extension to its rear was ridiculed; the driver sat well forward looking out over a relatively short bonnet and the rear wheels were set well back behind the back seat. All the new car's proportions were different from all the other new cars.\n\nAnother, at the time minor, distinctive feature but this one did not catch on was the centrally mounted light in the grille where most other manufacturers of good quality cars provided a pair, one fog and one driving light often separately mounted behind the bumper. Known as the \"Cyclops eye\" it was discontinued in the new grille announced 23 October 1952.\n\nPower came from a more powerful version of the previous model's 2.1 L (2103 cc/128 in³) Rover IOE straight-6 engine now with chromium-plated cylinder bores, an aluminium cylinder head with built-in induction manifold and a pair of horizontal instead of downdraught carburetters. A four-speed manual transmission was used with a column-mounted gear lever which was replaced by a floor-mounted mechanism in September 1953.\n\nA car tested by \"The Motor\" magazine in 1949 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 21.6 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1106 including taxes. The turning circle was .\n\n\". . . and I honestly believe (barring the Rolls-Royce) that there is no finer car built in the world today.\" Bob Dearborn, Tester Road & Track. Road test no. F-4-52, August 1952.\nAfter four years of the one model policy Rover returned to a range of the one car but three different sized engines. In September 1953 it announced it would supply a four-cylinder Rover 60 and a 2.6-litre Rover 90 adding them to the 75's 2.1-litre six. Rover's stated intention was \"to cater for a wider field of motorists who require a quality car with varying degrees of economical running costs and performance\".\n\nOn the same day there were modifications announced which were accordingly shared by all three:\n\nRover also announced an all-round reduction in Rover and Land-Rover prices. This was a response to a slump in both home and export sales of all British cars.<br>\nThe \"\" IOE engine continued. \nThe Rover 75 engine was enlarged in October 1954 to a 2.2 L (2230 cc/136 in³) version of the IOE engine.\n\nAn updated body for all Rovers was announced 7 October 1954 with major styling changes by David Bache\n\nAt the same time Rover's chairman revealed a new factory was being built to double Land-Rover production.\n\nIn September 1955 the choice of a different style of front seat, two individual seats independently adjustable, was made available on all three cars at extra cost.\n\nThe line of the front mudguards \"which\", said The Times, \"previously gave the car a somewhat blunt appearance\" was rearranged with the side lamps and flashing indicators in different positions. A small chrome reflector on the headlamp rim allowed the driver to know the side lights were functioning. Overdrive was made an option. These amendments were announced 11 September 1956.\n\nThe Rover 60 was announced 24 September 1953 to add a more economical four-cylinder engine to Rover's range though leaving trim and equipment the same as the 75 and the new Rover 90 announced at the same time. Rover's idiosyncratic central gear change lever designed to allow three-abreast seating in front was used for this new car. Its 2.0 L (1997 cc/121 in³) engine had been used in the early Land Rover though it now had modifications including an SU carburettor. As the block was shorter than that of the 6-cylinder engine, it sat further back in the frame, and this is sometimes held to have resulted in better handling and compensated for the lack of power. \n\nThe Rover 60 shared with the Rover 75 and Rover 90 the October 1954 modifications: a bigger boot, wide rear window and flashing directions indicators all announced at the Paris Motor Show. Independently adjustable separate front seats were made available at extra cost from September 1955.\n\nIn the same way Rover 60 buyers were given the choice of a different style of front seat, two individual seats independently adjustable, available at extra cost from September 1955.\n\nSimilarly in September 1956 the shape of the front mudguards was rearranged with the side lamps and flashing indicators in different positions. A small chrome reflector on the headlamp rim allowed the driver to know the side lights were functioning. Overdrive was made an option.\n\nIn their test of the Sixty in 1954 \"The Motor\" magazine recorded a top speed of and acceleration from 0– of 26.5 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1162 including taxes.\n\nThe Rover 60 was replaced by the Rover 80 which used an updated version of the overhead-valve 2286 cc (138 in³) four used in the Land Rover of that time. The Rover 80 was announced 24 October 1959.\n\nThe top-end Rover 90 appeared with a much larger more powerful inline-six at the same time, 24 September 1953 as the four-cylinder Rover 60 was introduced. Rover's idiosyncratic central gear change lever designed to allow three-abreast seating in front was used for this new car. This engine produced 90 hp (67 kW) and could propel the car to reach 90 mph (145 km/h). It has a cast-iron block with an aluminium alloy head, a bore and stroke of by and a 6.73:1 compression ratio. This was upped to 7.5:1 in 1956.\n\nRover's stated intention was to cater for a wider field of motorists requiring varying degrees of performance and running costs.\n\nThe Rover 90 shared with the Rover 60 and Rover 75 the October 1954 modifications: a bigger boot, wide rear window and flashing directions indicators all announced at the Paris Motor Show.\n\nThe 1956 model was launched in September 1955. Independently adjustable separate front seats were made available at extra cost and at the same time the engine's compression ratio was increased from 6.73:1 to 7.5:1, lifting power by 3 horsepower to 93. Free-wheel was dropped and Laycock de Normanville electric overdrive made available. More sensitive power brakes were provided of a redesigned pattern. The recesses in the 'B' pillars that previously housed the trafficators in pre-1955 models were deleted in this update. Pleats were added to the seats, this treatment continued on subsequent P4 models.\n\nIn September 1956 the shape of the front mudguards was rearranged with the side lamps and flashing indicators in different positions. A small chrome reflector on the headlamp rim allowed the driver to know the side lights were functioning.\n\nTesting the Ninety in 1954 \"The Motor\" magazine recorded a top speed of and acceleration from 0– of 18.9 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1297 including taxes. \n\nA road test of a Ninety published in \"MotorSport\" magazine in September 1956 described the engine as virtually inaudible when idling but the steering was \"spongy and heavy\" and \"the roll when cornering was considerable\" nevertheless, reported \"MotorSport\", firm suspension caused \"very appreciable column shake and body judder\". An owner of a Ninety at the time noted that although the suspension was very soft and comfortable on a straight road on bends the car would \"wallow\" over and made one feel a bit queasy.\n\nWhen it was replaced by the Rover 100 in October 1959, 35,903 had been produced, making the Rover 90 the most popular car of the P4 series.\n\nAnnounced 16 October 1956, the 105R and 105S used a high-output, 8.5:1 compression version of the \"\" engine used in the 90. The higher compression was to take advantage of the higher octane fuel that had become widely available. This twin-SU carburettor engine produced 108 hp (80 kW). Both 105 models also featured the exterior changes of the rest of the range announced a month earlier. The 105S featured separate front seats, a cigar lighter, chromed wheel trim rings and twin Lucas SFT 576 spotlamps. To minimise the cost of the 105R, these additional items were not standard, however they were provided on the (higher priced) 105R De Luxe.\n\nThe 105R featured a \"Roverdrive\" automatic transmission. This unit was designed and built by Rover and at the time was the only British-built automatic transmission. Others had bought in units from American manufacturers such as Borg-Warner. This unit was actually a two-speed automatic (Emergency Low which can be selected manually and Drive) with an overdrive unit for a total of three forward gears. The 105S made do with a manual transmission and Laycock de Normanville overdrive incorporating a kick-down control. The 105S could reach a top speed of 101 mph (163 km).\n\n\"The Motor\" magazine tested a 105R de luxe in 1957 and found it to have a top speed of and acceleration from 0– of 23.1 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1696 including taxes of £566.\n\nProduction of the 105 line ended in 1958 for the 105R and 1959 for the manual transmission 105S, 10,781 had been produced, two-thirds with the manual transmission option. For 1959 the manual model was described simply as a 105 and the trim and accessory level was reduced to match the other models.\n\nWhen the Rover 100 was announced in October 1959 it was described as the replacement for the Rover 90 and the Rover 105.\n\nThe 3-litre P5 car introduced in September 1958 was in full production and the obsolescent P4 range was reduced to just two cars, this new four-cylinder 80, announced on 24 October 1959 and the Rover 100 announced at the same time. The 80 engine was a new Land Rover-derived straight-four overhead-valve engine displacing \"\", entirely different from the units used in all the other models. With 80 hp (59 kW) available, the car could top 85 mph (137 km/h). Girling vacuum servo-assisted disc brakes at the front were new, and the car used wider tyres and had updated styling. Overdrive, operating on top gear only, was standard on the four-speed transmission. Options included a radio, two tone paint schemes, and either a bench or individual front seats. These options also apply to the 100 (see below).\n\nThe four-cylinder cars were never popular, and just 5,900 had been built when, after 3 years, production ended. Its place was taken by the new Rover 95 announced September 1962.\n\n\"The Motor\" magazine tested an 80 in 1961 and recorded a top speed of and acceleration from 0– of 22.4 seconds. A fuel consumption of was found. The test car cost £1396 including taxes of £411.\n\nThe Rover 90 and Rover 105 were replaced by the more powerful 100 announced on 24 October 1959. Its new but similar IOE straight-6 engine was a short-stroke version of the P5 3-Litre unit. The 100 could reach 100 mph (161 km/h). The interior was luxurious, with wood and leather accents on traditional English car elements like a curved \"Shepherds Crook\" handbrake lever. A bench front seat or individual front seats could be ordered. A heater was a standard fitting. Like the smaller 80 version, the 100 was fitted with servo-assisted Girling disc brakes at the front, keeping drum brakes at the rear. Overdrive, on top gear only, was a standard fitting.\n\nProduction ended in 1962, by which time 16,521 had been produced.\n\nTesting the 100 in 1960, \"The Motor\" magazine recorded a top speed of , acceleration from 0– of 17.6 seconds and a fuel consumption of . The test car cost £1538 including taxes.\n\nThe final members of the series were the 95 and 110. The Rover 95 was a Rover 100 re-geared for economy and offered at the price level of the four-cylinder Rover 80 it replaced. The Rover 110 was a Rover 100 with a more powerful engine. Announced 27 September 1962 these cars represented the end of an era. They were fitted with not alloy but steel door panels to reduce cost. Their very full equipment included electric windscreen washers. Although the Roverdrive automatic had been put to rest, overdrive was standard on the 110. The 95 made do with a higher ratio final drive (3.9:1).\n\nBoth cars used the same \"\" version of the IOE engine. The wider availability of higher octane fuels permitted an increase in the compression ratio to 8.8:1, and the old unit now produced 123 hp (91 kW) in 110 guise, which used a Weslake cylinder head, and 102 hp (76 kW) in the 95.\n\nThe Motor magazine road tested, ref 2/64, a Rover 110 on 30 January 1963. This car achieved a mean maximum of 100.0 mph, 0-60 mph in 15.9 seconds and the standing quarter mile in 20.6 seconds. This was the fastest P4 model tested in the series by The Motor.\nAfter a successful run of some 15 years, the Rover 95 and Rover 110 were eventually replaced by Rover's wholly new Rover 2000 announced 9 October 1963 but they remained available into 1964.\n\nThe P4 platform was used in Rover's gas turbine programme, most notably as the origin of the JET 1 prototype shown to the public in the United Kingdom and United States in 1950 and subjected to speed tests on the Jabbeke highway in Belgium in 1952. JET 1, a mid-engine two-seat open tourer, was based on the P4 bodyshell. The original JET 1 is on display in the London Science Museum.\n\nTwo further prototypes powered by gas turbine were based on the P4. The T2 had a four-door body and its gas turbine under the bonnet at the front of the car. Problems with the T2 caused Rover to abandon the front-engine concept and rebuild the car, redesignated T2A, with the turbine over the rear wheels.\n"}

The road is part of the A12, a 129-mile road connecting Blackwall in London with the seaside town of Great Yarmouth in Norfolk.\n\nThe road starts off at the end of the A12 Hackney Wick to M11 Link Road, a section of the A12 built in 1999 to bypass Wanstead and to link it with the former A102 (M) (now A12). It meets the Redbridge Roundabout, where the A12 meets the North Circular (A406). Prior to 1989, the road was the M15, providing a direct link onto the M11 motorway. It then heads down to the Gants Hill Roundabout near Ilford. It passes through a very built up area, and heads through Newbury Park, passing Newbury Park tube station. It then passes William Torbit School. A few miles down the road it goes into the suburban town of Romford. After this, it ends at the Gallows Corner roundabout (a former execution site) where it meets with the A127. Traffic wishing to go down to Southend on the A127 must use the flyover, built as a temporary measure in 1969; it was originally designed for the M12 motorway, which would have run from South Woodford at the M11 to the proposed Maplin Sands Airport in Southend-on-Sea.\n\nThe road was built in the 1920s through 1930s as a bypass of the A12 (now A118), which went through Romford, Chadwell Heath, Goodmayes, Ilford before meeting the A11 at Stratford. It was originally designated the A106. By the mid-1940s, the road had been re-designated as the A12, with the old A12 being downgraded to the non-primary A118 road, which now ends at the A11 in Bow.\n\nThe Eastern Avenue is mostly used by local traffic, because the M11 motorway, built in 1980, is effectively a complete bypass of the Eastern Avenue, and the A13 also provides a much quicker route into London. It is a slow road. as the speed limits are only 50 mph and 40 mph, and there are traffic lights at almost every junction, with roundabouts and frontal development. However, when there is traffic on the M25, heavy goods vehicles and other through traffic heading into London will often use the Eastern Avenue instead.\n\n\n"}

The bands in eastern Oregon traded with the tribes to the north, who by 1730 had acquired the horse. In the mid-18th century, some bands developed a horse culture and split off to become the Bannock tribe. The horse gave the tribe a greater range, from Oregon to northern Nevada, southern Idaho, and western Wyoming. They forayed from there on the Bannock Trail to Montana and Canada to hunt buffalo.\n\nThe Bannock made pottery, utensils from mountain sheep horns, and carrying bags from salmon skin. Their petroglyphs date back before European contact, and, after the introduction of glass beads, they transferred their geometric design to beadwork. For water transport, they made tule reed rafts. Prior to the late 19th century, Bannock people fished for salmon on the Snake River in Idaho and in the fall, they hunted buffalo herds.

Following the success of her previous album, \"Switched-On Bach\" (1968), Carlos proceeded to record a second album of classical music performed on a modular Moog synthesizer from multiple composers, including Johann Sebastian Bach, Claudio Monteverdi, Domenico Scarlatti, and George Frideric Handel. Its title is a play on words from Bach's set of preludes and fugues named \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\".\n\nUpon its release, the album peaked at No. 199 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart and was nominated for two Grammy Awards.\n\nIn 1969, during the unexpected commercial success of her debut studio album \"Switched-On Bach\" (1968), Carlos and her friend, collaborator, and producer Rachel Elkind started work on a follow-up using the same formula as \"Switched-On Bach\": performing selections of classical music on a modular Moog synthesizer. Carlos planned to record an \"ambitious 19th-century work\", but the lack of sufficient multitrack recording capabilities at the time did not allow such an undertaking. Ideas for Carlos to record her own compositions seemed \"untimely\" and was shelved for potential future albums. The two decided on a \"new switched on Baroque album\" featuring multiple composers, including Johann Sebastian Bach, Claudio Monteverdi, Domenico Scarlatti, and George Frideric Handel.\n\nLike \"Switched-On Bach\", the album was recorded on an 8-track Ampex tape recorder using numerous takes and overdubs. Carlos chose pieces from Handel's \"Water Music\" suites as the music contained passages that suited to the limitations of the Moog synthesizer.\n\nCanadian pianist Glenn Gould spoke about Carlos' rendition of Brandenburg Concerto No. 4 in G major: \"To put it bluntly, the finest performance of any of the Brandenburgs—live, canned, or intuited—I've ever heard.\"\n\n\"The Well-Tempered Synthesizer\" was released in November 1969.

Abraham (1933), who has made the most complete linguistic study of Tiv, classifies it as Bantu, stating that its vocabulary is more similar to the East African Nyanza group of Bantu languages than to Ekoi or other neighbouring languages. Malherbe (1933) agrees with Abraham that Tiv is essentially Bantu.\n\nAll material on Tiv seems to point to a recent expansion, perhaps as late as the 18th century.\n\nTiv has three main tones (five if rising and falling are counted as separate tones instead of composites of existing tones). They are most importantly used in inflection.\n\nTiv has nine noun classes.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1905194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905194", "title": "Tiv people", "text": "Tiv people\n\nTiv (or Tiiv) are a Bantoid ethnic group. They constitute approximately 3.5% of Nigeria's total population, and number about 6.5 million individuals throughout Nigeria and Cameroon.\nThe Tiv language is spoken by about 7 million people in Nigeria with a few speakers in Cameroon. Most of the language's Nigerian speakers are found in Benue, Taraba and Nasarawa States. The language is a branch of Benue–Congo and ultimately of the Niger–Congo phylum. In precolonial times, the Fulani ethnic group referred to the Tiv as \"Munchi\" (also sometimes written Munshi e.g. Duggan 1932), a term not accepted by Tiv people. They depend on agricultural produce for commerce and life.\n\nThe Tiv say they emerged into their present location from the southeast. It is claimed >ref mark Cartwright records of the great Bantu migration that the Tiv wandered through southern, south-central and west-central Africa before arriving at the savannah lands of West African Sudan via the River Congo and Cameroon Mountains and settled at swemkaragbe the region adjoining Cameron and Nigeria in the beginning of 1500CE >ref mark Cartwright ancient history of great Bantu migration.\"Coming down,\" as they put it, was in batches, some moved southward across obudu mountains others moved northward and settled at mdema and Waka district, while others moved into Central Nigeria, \nthis dispersions takes place in the late 1500CE to 1600CE, they mingled with the Fulani with whom they still recognize a joking relationship (\"fulani Jo and Tiv Jo\"). The Tiv people were a free people without a king hence every clan or kindred was administered by the eldest man called \"Orya\" they were amongst the first inhabitants of the Benue valley according to mark Cartwright record of Bantu migration before other tribes finally migrate to join them, Due to their peaceful disposition and disperse nature of living and no Central government nor king they pose no threat to new migrants to the region who cohabited with them until the coming of the EuropeanS The Europeans first contact with Tiv was in 1852, their late recognition was due to the lack of kingship which became a big disadvantage to Tiv in Nigeria because the colonial masters prefer working with kings, so when Tiv were found on the banks of the river benue and where known to be the major occupants of the BENUE valley, That was when kinship was later introduce to Tiv people by the European in the 1940s Benue. In 1879 their occupation of the riverbanks was about the same as in 1950. British occupying forces entered Tivland from the east in 1906, when they were called in to protect a Hausa and Jukun enclave that the Tiv had attacked. The Tiv said in 1950 that they had defeated this British force, then later invited the British in. The southern area was penetrated from the south; what southern Tiv call \"the eruption\" of the British there occurred in 1911.\n\nThe Tiv came into contact with European culture during the colonial period. During November 1907 to spring 1908, an expedition of the Southern Nigeria Regiment led by Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Trenchard came into contact with the Tiv. Trenchard brought gifts for the tribal chiefs. Subsequently, roads were built and trade links established between Europeans and the Tiv. But before construction of roads began, a missionary named Mary Slessor went throughout the region seeing to the people's needs.\n\nThe Tiv national attire is the black-and-white-striped 'Anger'. When the Tiv people arrived at their current location several centuries earlier, they discovered that the zebra they used to hunt for meat and skin, used for ceremonial attire, was not native to the area. When they acquired the skill of the loom, they decided to honour their heritage by weaving a cloth with black-and-white stripes, reminiscent of the zebra skin; this would then be made attires as preferred. Initially, it was a simple cloth to be draped around the torso. Nowadays, it is made into elaborate robes, such as those worn by the traditional rulers and elders - from the Tor Tiv downwards. \n\nThe black-and-white colour of the necklaces worn by the traditional rulers has been chosen to match the robes.\n\nMost Tiv have a highly developed sense of genealogy, with descent being reckoned patrilineally. Ancestry is traced to an ancient individual named Tiv, who had two sons; all Tiv consider themselves a member either of Ichongo (descendants of son Chongo) or of Ipusu (descendants of son Pusu). Ichongo and Ipusu are each divided into several major branches, which in turn are divided into smaller branches. The smallest branch, or minimal lineage, is the \"ipaven\". Members of an \"ipaven\" tend to live together, the local kin-based community being called the \"tar\". This form of social organisation, called a segmentary lineage, is seen in various parts of the world, but it is particularly well known from African societies (Middleton and Tait 1958). The Tiv are the best known example in West Africa of a society of segmentary lineage, as documented by Laura Bohannan (1952) and by Paul and Laura Bohannan (1953); in East Africa, the best known example is the Nuer, documented by E.E. Evans-Pritchard (1940).\n\nThe Tiv had no administrative divisions and no chiefs nor councils. Leadership was based on age, influence and affluence. The leaders' functions were to furnish safe conduct, arbitrate disputes within their lineages, sit on moots and lead their people in all external and internal affairs.\n\nThese socio-political arrangements caused great frustration to British colonial attempts to subjugate the population and establish administration on the lower Benue. The strategy of indirect rule, which the British felt to be highly successful in controlling Hausa and Fulani populations in Northern Nigeria, was ineffective in a segmentary society like the Tiv (Dorward 1969). Colonial officers tried various approaches to administration, such as putting the Tiv under the control of the nearby Jukun, and trying to exert control through the councils of elders (\"Jir Tamen\"); these met with little success. The British administration in 1934 divided the Tiv into Clans, Kindreds, and Family Groups. The British appointed native heads of these divisions as well. These administrative divisions are gradually assuming a reality which they never had originally.\n\nMembers of the Tiv group are found in many areas across the globe, such as the United States and United Kingdom. In these countries, they hold unions, known as MUT (Mzough U Tiv, or Mutual Union of Tiv in English), where members can assemble and discuss issues concerning their people across the world, but especially back in Nigeria. The arm of the MUT serving the United States of America is known as MUTA (Mzough U Tiv ken Amerika, or Mutual Union of the Tiv in America), for instance.\n\nBefore the introduction of printed material, radio, film and television, mass communication in Nigeria was done through the indigenous people with the use of traditional political systems of communication. The rulers and the chiefs governed their ethnic communities and communicated with them through various channels.\n\nLocally made musical instruments were traditionally used for political and ceremonial communication. The key instruments follow.\n\nThe Kakaki is a royal trumpet used in many West African groups in Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Burkina Faso. This is an instrument used to convey special messages to the people of the community, such as the birth of the child of the King, his naming ceremony, the crowning of a new king, or to gather people together during the marriage ceremony of the king and the king’s son’s marriage ceremony. This instrument was used to convey all the messages to the people to assemble at the square for the ceremony. When there is an enemy attack on the community, a warning sound of the Kakaki is blown to alert those who can defend the society and every citizen to be alert.\n\nA light wooden instrument, it was used to pass messages to the people of the village, probably for the invitation of the people for a particular meeting of the elders at the king’s palace or for the people to gather at the market square for a message from or by the king. Up till today, it is the main instrument for the celebration of newlyweds (marriage reception ceremony or Kwase-kuhan).\n\nA heavy wooden instrument carved out of mahogany trunk through some mysterious way; myth has it that a chosen carver turns into a worm to create the large hollow in the cut trunk, leaving only a small opening (like in a medical operation). This belief is perhaps due to the fact that the carvers are reluctant to explain the technique employed for such artistic finesse. The Indyer, believed to be connected with high magico-spiritual potency, is not played for secular purposes except for special occasions as sanctioned by the elders. It is used to communicate the death of an important personality in the community or to communicate a serious happening in the community, like a call to war.\n\nIt is used together with Agbande (drums) combined with Ageda at festivals to pass a message across to the people for a call for the display of culture.\n\nIt is an instrument like a violin, used for music and dances in conjunction with Agbande (Agbande) at festivals and dance occasions, sometimes to announce the death of a leader or an elder of the community. During this period it is played sorrowfully for the mourning of the dead. It is mostly played at funerals.\n\nAgbande (plural) are a set of crafted wooden musical instruments used to complement agbande at festivals. They are particularly large and are played by the young men of the community. Special drum beats communicate special messages and music for the festivals to come and during the festivals, for instance, royal occasions such as the coronation and funeral.\n\nUsually, he is chosen by the elders of the community to do errands for the elders and the leader of the community. He is sent out to the heads of the neighbouring families for a crucial meeting at the head of all the leaders of the community.\n\nThis is an instrument made out of cow horns. There are farmers' associations that use this instrument when they have a job to do; for instance, when they are invited to make ridges on a piece of land, the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the association will use this medium to wake up the members for the work they have for that day.\n\nIndigenous communication is not only vertical, from the rulers to the subjects, but is also horizontal. Individuals communicate with society through physical and metaphysical means. A farm owner, for example, may mount a charm conspicuously on his farm in order to stress private ownership and to scare off human intruders.\n\nThe fear of herbalists and witches influences social behaviour considerably.\n\nRainmakers communicate their power to disrupt events through various psychological means. Village sectors in Africa communicate mostly via the marketplace of ideas contributed by traditional religion, observances, divination, mythology, age-grades, the Chiefs courts, the elder's square, secret and title societies, the village market square, the village drum (gbande) men, indeed the total experiences of the villager in his environment.\n\nUnlike the mass media, access to the native media is culturally determined and not economic. Only the selected group of young men or the elders can disseminate information generally. The young only disseminate general information about events and the social welfare of their communities using the media mentioned above.\n\nThe Tiv people of Benue state still practise some of this traditional system of communication, using the Kakais, Agbande, Indyer, Adiguve, Ilyu, etc. Nevertheless the increase in the western world media is threatening the cultural communication system.\n\nMany of the communities in Benue state still use these instruments to convey messages to the people of their community, and it is helping a great deal, since there is a language barrier between people with the introduction of the western world's means of communication, using a western language (English) to convey information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n / US- pb.\n\n"}
{"id": "1905201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905201", "title": "Titterstone Clee Hill", "text": "Titterstone Clee Hill\n\nTitterstone Clee Hill, sometimes referred to as Titterstone Clee or, incorrectly, Clee Hill (which is the lower hill to the southeast), is a prominent hill in the rural English county of Shropshire, rising at the summit to above sea level.\n\nIt is one of the Clee Hills, in the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The nearest town to the hill is Ludlow, which can be seen from parts of Cleehill village.\n\nTitterstone Clee is the third-highest hill in Shropshire, surpassed only by the nearby Brown Clee Hill () and Stiperstones (). Much of the higher part of the hill is common land, used for the grazing of sheep, air traffic control services and both working and disused quarries. The summit of Titterstone Clee is bleak, treeless and shaped by decades of quarrying. Many of the industrial structures still remain, and contribute to the intimidating and mysterious atmosphere of the hill top, especially during the prolonged winter fogs that descend over these hills.\n\nInvestigations have led some individuals to claim that Titterstone Clee was once an active volcano. However, this was conclusively shown to be incorrect in the 1930s when exposures clearly revealed an intrusive origin for the igneous rock which is found beneath the higher ground. Locally this is known as Dhu Stone (Welsh for Black Stone); geologically it is an olivine basalt, sometimes coarse enough to be a dolerite. It appears to have been intruded as a sill between sandstone layers within the unconsolidated strata of the Middle Westphalian soon after deposition of the latter.\n\nThe weather on Titterstone Clee Hill can be particularly hazardous, with locally famous fog and drizzle being commonplace. Snow and ice can also cause problems in winter, as well as gales.\n\nMost of the summit of the hill is affected by man-made activity, the result of hill fort construction during the Bronze and Iron Ages and, more recently, by years of mining for coal and quarrying for dhustone (dolerite) to be used in road-building. Also, many derelict quarry buildings are scattered over the hill, now used only by sheep sheltering from the worst of weather but interesting from an industrial archaeology point of view as very early examples of the use of reinforced concrete. Combined, these give the summit of the hill an eerie, other-worldly feel.\n\nThe A4117 between Cleobury Mortimer and Ludlow runs to the south of Titterstone Clee, and rises to above sea level at its highest point on Clee Hill Common. Because of this, the road is often affected by snow in winter.\n\nThe village of Cleehill lies on this road as it crosses the hill and, at above sea level, it is home to the highest pub in Shropshire, called The Kremlin, and also to the highest primary school. On the northeast slope of the hill is the small village of Cleeton St Mary.\n\nFrom the hill it is possible on a clear day to see west to Snowdonia, north east to the Peak District, east to the Black Country, south east to the Cotswolds, south to the Malvern Hills, and south west to the Black Mountains and Brecon Beacons. The hill is said to provide one of the best views in England on a clear day.\n\nOver the years Titterstone Clee has been subject to much quarrying for dhustone or basalt. It is because of this that the hill is littered with many abandoned quarries. In medieval times ironstone and, later, coal were mined, in particular from bell pits: localised mine shafts, one of which has now flooded to form a lake. The largest quarries have sheer drops of up to around 100 feet (30m).\n\nBefore the Second World War, the area would be described as industrial, because of the presence of wide-scale quarrying and associated activity. Men came from places such as Bridgnorth and Ludlow to work in the quarries, and the villages of Bedlam and Dhustone on Titterstone Clee were built especially for the quarry workers. Crumbling remains of quarry buildings now litter the hill, reminders of a bygone industry that once employed more than 2,000 people here. An old narrow gauge railway incline is still visible on the hill and a large concrete structure under which the wagons were filled with stone still remains next to the modern day car park. Nearby, on the flanks of Clee Hill, a standard gauge railway incline provided means of exporting quarried stone from above Cleehill village. This railway infrastructure remained intact until abandoned in the early 1960s. In the past the quarries have also been worked (on a much smaller scale) for coal, fireclay and limestone.\n\nEarly in the 20th century, a further large quarry (the Magpie Quarry) opened on the eastern side of Clee Hill and an aerial ropeway was built to carry stone off the hill eastwards to the railway at Detton Ford. The footings for the tall pylons which supported the wires still remain near the summit, parallel to the modern day track to the radar domes.\n\nClee Hill is still quarried behind Cleehill village. Quarrying resumed here in the late 1980s, 50 years after the Titterstone Clee Dhustone quarry closed just below the summit. The main buildings of the quarry are just visible from the A4117 road but virtually hidden from view by ingenious landscaping.\n\nSeveral radar domes and towers operate on the summit of the hill. The largest of the radar arrays is part of the National Air Traffic Services (NATS) radar network, and covers one of 30 overlapping regions of UK airspace. The one on Titterstone Clee monitors all aircraft within a 100-mile radius. The smaller of the two is a Met Office weather radar which is part of a network of 16 radars across the country used to detect cloud precipitation (rain). The domes and masts are well-known local landmarks, with one in particular often being nicknamed \"the golf ball\" because of it looking like a giant teed-up golf ball. They can be seen for many miles, even from some parts of The Black Country.\n\nA 20th century triangulation pillar marks the summit, whilst just to the left of it are the remains of a Bronze Age cairn, dating back up to 4,000 years and indicating that the summit was a likely ceremonial site. Although partly destroyed by quarrying, Titterstone Clee's Iron Age hill fort or encampment, enclosed by a huge boundary earthworks, has fared better than those on Brown Clee. It is of note that the walls of the fort are made up of stone blocks, instead of earth banks. Also near the summit is the Giant's Chair – a pile of boulders created during cold phases of the Devensian ice age.\n\nClee Hill is one of only a few hills and mountains noted on the Hereford Mappa Mundi, a 13th-century map of the world displayed at Hereford Cathedral.\n\nTitterstone Clee is popular with walkers, but much less so than nearby hills such as the Long Mynd. Walkers can access the summit by taking the A4117 from just past Bewdley and Ludlow. About three quarters of a mile to the Ludlow side of Cleehill village, turn right up the single-track road signposted \"Dhustone\" and \"Titterstone Clee summit\". Drive to the top of the track and park on the old railway yard near the old quarry buildings. To walk to the summit follow the track around the radar installations.\n\nTitterstone Clee plays a central role in the Ellis Peters' novel \"The Virgin in the Ice\".\n\n\n"}

His name is most frequently associated with the Amsterdam Central Station (1881–1889) and the Rijksmuseum (1876–1885), both in Amsterdam. More representative for his oeuvre, however, are numerous churches, of which he designed more than 100. Moreover, he restored many monuments.\n\nCuypers was born in Roermond, the son of a church painter, and grew up in surroundings in which interest for art was encouraged. After he studied at the urban college in Roermond, he moved to Antwerp in 1844 to study architecture at the Royal art academy. He was taught by Frans Andries Durlet, Frans Stoop and Ferdinand Berckmans, all pioneers of the neo-Gothic architecture in Belgium. Cuypers was a good student; in 1849, he gained the \"Prix d'Excellence\" of the academy.\n\nAfter a tour in the German Rheinland, he returned to Roermond, where he was appointed a town architect in 1851. In 1852, he opened a workshop where ecclesiastical art was manufactured.\n\nCuypers' ecclesiastical work was initially strongly influenced by 13th century French architecture and by the writings of his friends Eugene Viollet-le-Duc and J. A. Alberdingk Thijm. Cuypers built many churches throughout the Netherlands, in which the French influence played a prominent role. Highlights from these first period are the Lambert's Church in Veghel and the Sint-Catharinakerk (Eindhoven)}Catharina Church in Eindhoven, among others. From 1870 onwards Cuypers' style became more influenced by the native Gothic styles of the Netherlands as well as Gothic styles from other countries like Norway and Italy. He also experimented with centralizing ground-plans and other non-conventional layouts. In this second part of his career he built some of his best work. After 1883 he was assisted by his son Joseph Cuypers in much of his work.\n\nCuypers led many restorations. His conceptions concerning restorations has been frequently criticized; restoration often implied that the building was awfully damaged, but Cuypers tried to satisfy an idealized image of the style or the idea how the original builders had intended a building to be rather than to preserve the architectural evolution of the building. An early example of this is the extensive restoration of the Munster Church in Roermond, where Cuypers replaced original towers by new ones. From 1875 he led the restoration of the eastern front of the Mainz Cathedral, which he executed according to his own plans in Romanesque style. In doing so, he created as an opposite pole to the western tower group the high, gothic likely eastern tower helmet, replacing a bell floor and the Moller iron cupola. \n\nPierre Cuypers was the uncle of Eduard Cuypers who trained in his practice as a young man. Other relatives who became architects are his grandsons Pierre Cuypers jr. and Theo Taen.\n\nCuypers was a practising Roman Catholic and a member of the Lay Dominicans. As such, he was buried in the Dominican habit. He died in his home town of Roermond, aged 93.\n\n\n\nThe year 2007-2008 has been proclaimed \"Cuypersjaar\" (Cuypers year) in the Netherlands. A great number of activities and exhibitions are organized around this theme including an exhibition on Cuypers' architecture at the Netherlands Architecture Institute in Rotterdam and Maastricht.\n\n"}

In 1772 he moved to Litchfield, situated on the crossroads of important inland trade routes, to open a new law practice. In 1773, he built a six-room, two-story house.\n\nReeve, while a fervent supporter of the patriot cause, did not enter active service early in the Revolutionary War. His wife's poor health held him at home. However, in December 1776, the Connecticut Assembly called upon him to travel the state to drum up volunteers for the Continental Army. He then accepted a commission as an officer and accompanied his recruits as far as New York before returning to his ailing wife.\nReeve took his brother-in-law, Aaron Burr, Jr. as a law student. In the beginning, Aaron Burr lived upstairs and took instruction in the downstairs parlor, adjacent to the gathering room where Reeve held mock court. Also on the first floor was Reeve's private law office.\n\nIn 1781 Reeve worked with Theodore Sedgwick to represent Elizabeth Freeman (known as Bett), a slave in Sheffield, Massachusetts, in a legal bid for her freedom. Bett had listened to discussions related to the Sheffield Declaration, and to a reading of the 1780 Massachusetts Constitution, the latter containing the phrase \"\". She then asked Sedgwick to take her case to a local court. Reeve and Sedgwick successfully secured her freedom on constitutional grounds. The case, \"Brom & Bett v. Ashley\", set a precedent that led to the abolition of slavery in Massachusetts.\n\nDue in part to notoriety gained from the Elizabeth Freeman case, Reeve's student enrollment began to grow. In 1784, he added a second building (known as the Samuel Seymour House) to house and instruct his law students. Among the students was John C. Calhoun who, like Aaron Burr, became Vice President of the United States.\n\nIn 1798, Reeve became a judge of Connecticut's Superior Court. He then hired James Gould, a former student, to assist in running the school. Together, they built up the most prominent law school of its time.\n\nReeve is also noted for bringing Reverend Lyman Beecher (father of Harriet Beecher Stowe) to Litchfield in 1810 to serve as a Presbyterian minister for over 25 years, during which time he became notable for his preaching against alcohol and Unitarianism.\n\nIn 1814, Reeve was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Connecticut. At this time, Gould took over the law school. Reeve maintained contact with the school until 1820, three years before his death. The school continued to operate until 1833. \nReeve's \"Law of Baron and Femme\", first published in 1816, was the preeminent American treatise on family law for much of the 19th century. It underwent revisions and re-publication in 1846, 1867, and 1888.\n\nReeve's only child, Aaron Burr Reeve, was born on October 3, 1780. Aaron Burr Reeve went on to graduate from Yale, and became a lawyer in Troy, New York.\n\nSarah Reeve was often in ill health, and died on March 30, 1797. In 1799, Reeve married Elizabeth \"Betsy\" Thompson, with whom he had no children.\n\nReeve died on December 13, 1823 in Litchfield, Connecticut, at the age of 79. His home, now known as Tapping Reeve House and Law School, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1905250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905250", "title": "Action News", "text": "Action News\n\nAction News is a local television newscast format originating in the United States. First conceived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, it is characterized by a tight format with strict time limits on set packages, a focus on surrounding suburbs, and a focus on young talent. It was a competitor to the \"Eyewitness News\" format.\n\nThe \"Action News\" format was conceived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at WFIL-TV (now WPVI-TV) by news director Mel Kampmann in 1970, as a response to the \"Eyewitness News\" format that was used on rival station KYW-TV. At the time, WFIL-TV was said to be \"#4 in a three-station market.\"\n\nThe main difference between Action News and Eyewitness News was that the former was far more tightly formatted. Time limits were placed on packages – for instance, a reporter package could be no longer than 90 seconds. This difference enabled the station to cover more stories than its competitors. Another key difference was the focus on the surrounding Philadelphia suburban areas – a response to the movement of residents from the city to the suburbs. Finally, WPVI placed more emphasis on young talent – while WCAU-TV and KYW-TV used older, well-known news anchors such as Vince Leonard, Tom Snyder, and John Facenda, WPVI had a young Larry Kane as its top anchor. Later, the station would add the very popular Jim O'Brien as its main weathercaster.\n\nThe format was immediately successful, and after going back and forth with KYW for first place, WPVI took the lead in 1977, which it has held ever since. Capital Cities Communications, which acquired WPVI in 1972 and gave the station its current call sign, took the format to most of its other stations.\n\nOne of the major development stations for WPVI's \"Action News\" was its Capital Cities sister station, WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York. Under the leadership of news director Irv Weinstein, who had developed his own similar format under the name \"Eyewitness News\" (and before that, \"Pulse Beat News\" and \"Rock and Roll Radio News\"), WKBW developed much of the talent that WPVI would later hire to boost them to #1 in the market; anchor Jim Gardner (replacing Larry Kane when he moved to WABC in New York), weatherman Dave Roberts, and voice-over artist Jeff Kaye are the three highest-profile WPVI personalities to have come from WKBW.\n\nWPIX in New York City, an independent station at the time, picked up the Action News concept (and music) successfully for its 10 p.m. newscast. The newscast won numerous awards, but the station never approached the ratings of longtime leader WNEW-TV (now WNYW).\n\nIn 2002 and 2003 (respectively), WFTS-TV in Tampa, Florida and KSHB-TV in Kansas City, Missouri (both owned by the E. W. Scripps Company) became the first stations in the country to identify themselves using Action News as full-time station branding (for both local newscasts and entertainment programming) with no station number.\n\nToday, Action News innovations have been incorporated into newscasts across the country. In 2000, WestNet Wireless launched the first Action News brand online with its web-broadcast style format for the markets of Calgary, Alberta and Santa Barbara, California WestNet also owns the trademark for Action News in Canada and even owns the domain Now Action News Started Also in India. Action News India Provide Local City News. http://action.news\n\nOutside the United States, the Action News title was used by the following television stations:\n\nWhen WFIL originally adopted the Action News format in 1970, the program was introduced with the \"Action News Theme\". The theme was written by Temple University student Tom Sellers (who later went on to become a professional musician and producer), and was arranged as a brass-driven rock song. The entire theme was offered through the \"Philadelphia Inquirer\", as a single sided 45 RPM record for about 25¢.\n\nTwo years later, the station (under its new call sign WPVI) replaced the \"Action News Theme\" with Al Ham's \"Move Closer to Your World\".\nWPVI continues to use this theme after four decades, even as others have stopped using it, although it has been remastered several times (which have included the removal of a bongo line) in order for the theme to sound less dated. In 1996, the station replaced the original Al Ham theme with a fuller, orchestral version performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Viewer outcry caused the station to drop the new version within five days. \"Move Closer to Your World\" is probably the only news theme to be offered as a ringtone, which is offered by WPVI free of charge.\n\nAction News offered the first evening newscasts to be solo anchored by a woman: Diana Robinson, who was the first African-American female news anchor in American television. She was followed by Jacqui Mullen.\n\nWPVI opens its broadcasts with a rapid montage featuring scenes of Philadelphia-area activities. The scenes are rotated to reflect the current season. For example, spring footage of the Phillies, NASCAR, CART and DIRT starts on March 21, while footage of the Philadelphia Eagles, Philadelphia Flyers, and 76ers starts on September 23, and footage of the Mummers Parade with other winter scenes is shown from December 21 to March 21.\n\nAlthough \"Move Closer to Your World\" is strongly associated with the Action News format, many stations that have used the \"Action News\" name actually chose to use other pieces of music for their newscasts. Notably, a handful of stations continued to use Tom Sellers' original theme into the 1980s, with WBNG-TV in Binghamton, New York using the theme for its Action News broadcast as late as 1993. Conversely, stations that use \"Move Closer to Your World\" do not necessarily use the \"Action News\" name or format. WNEP-TV in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, Pennsylvania used the original version of the theme for many years before switching to a modern variation which only partially resembles the original.\n\n\n"}

He is considered as one of the most influential criminologists of the 20th century. He was a sociologist of the symbolic interactionist school of thought and is best known for defining white-collar crime and differential association, a general theory of crime and delinquency. Sutherland earned his Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Chicago in 1913.\n\nSutherland's historical importance rests upon his having introduced (in a 27 December 1939 speech to the American Sociological Association, titled \"The White Collar Criminal\") the concept of white-collar crime, a concept which violated existing prejudices that aristocrats can do no wrong (which was famously expressed in the ancient legal view that a king could do no wrong).\n\nAfter receiving his PhD from the University of Chicago, Sutherland was at William Jewell College, Missouri (1913–1919), the University of Kansas (the summer of 1918), University of Illinois (1919–1925), Sutherland spent a summer at Northwestern (June–August 1922) prior to arriving at the University of Minnesota in 1925.\n\nSutherland solidified his reputation as one of the country's leading criminologists at the University of Minnesota, where he worked from 1926 to 1929. During this period, he concentrated in sociology as a scientific enterprise whose goal was to understand and control social problems. For several months in 1929 Sutherland studied the British penal system while in England. Also, during 1929–1930 Sutherland worked as a researcher with the Bureau of Social Hygiene in New York City. In 1930, Sutherland accepted a position as a research professor at the University of Chicago. In 1935 he took a position at Indiana University, where he remained till his untimely death on October 11, 1950. He founded the Bloomington School of Criminology at Indiana University.\n\nDuring his time at Indiana, he published four books, including \"Twenty Thousand Homeless Men\" (1936), \"The Professional Thief\" (1937), the third edition of \"Principles of Criminology\" (1939), and the censored first edition of \"White Collar Crime\" (1949), his masterpiece. It remained censored until the original text was published in 1983 by Yale University Press.\n\nSutherland was elected president of the American Sociological Society in 1939, and president of the Sociological Research Association in 1940. If he had not already become prominent within the sociological profession prior to his introduction of the concept of white-collar crime in 1939, one can only speculate whether the seminal concept would have been published, as America's largest corporations threatened to sue the publishers of \"White Collar Crime\". (They were successful, and had all references to the names of litigating corporations removed from the text.) When Yale University Press issued the unexpurgated version in 1983, the introduction by Gilbert Geis noted that Sutherland's concept of white-collar crime \"altered the study of crime throughout the world in fundamental ways\".\n\nHe was the author of the leading text \"Criminology\", published in 1924, first stating the principle of differential association in the third edition retitled \"Principles of Criminology\" (1939:4–8) that the development of habitual patterns of criminality arise from association with those who commit crime rather than with those who do not commit crime. The theory also had a structural element positing that conflict and social disorganisation are the underlying causes of crime because they the patterns of people associated with. This latter element was dropped when the fourth edition was published in 1947. But he remained convinced that social class was a relevant factor, coining the phrase \"white-collar criminal\" in a speech to the American Sociological Association on December 27, 1939. In his 1949 monograph \"White-Collar Crime\" he defined a white-collar crime \"approximately as a crime committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of his occupation.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Wentworthville is located 27 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. Wentworthville is split between the local government areas of the City of Parramatta and the Cumberland Council. Wentworthville is colloquially known as 'Wenty'.\n\nWentworthville, Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains and, Wentworth in far western New South Wales, were named after the Wentworth family. A land grant of 2000 acres (8 km²) in this area was made in 1810 to D'Arcy Wentworth, the father of William Wentworth, the famous Australian explorer, barrister, newspaper publisher, politician and landowner.\n\nAnother pioneer to the area, William Fullagar established the Star Inn on the corner of Ettalong Road and the Western Road (now the Great Western Highway). Fullagar also opened a cattle saleyards which became one of the principal ones for the colony. His family's estate \"Essington House\" is now the site of a Christian school. Fullagar Road is named after him.\n\nIn the mid-1800s, a land boom attracted people into the area, land was subdivided for housing and small farms. Wentworth's holdings were sub-divided - amounting to 600 lots. The railway line had been put through on its way to Penrith, in 1864, but it was not until 1883 that Wentworthville got its own public railway station. Originally the railway station was called T. R. Smith's Platform but was renamed Wentworthville two years later.\n\nIn 2007 the boundaries were redrawn and the northern part of Wentworthville became the suburb of Constitution Hill.\n\nWentworthville has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nWentworthville has two shopping precincts. The larger, older precinct sits on the Cumberland Council side of Wentworthville railway station (the other side of the railway is part of City of Parramatta Council local government area and is mainly zoned residential). A Supa IGA (formerly Franklins) dominated Wentworthville Mall Shopping Centre until late 2017 when it closed. \n\nThe newer commercial centre is on the Great Western Highway. It is dominated by Woolworths. Initially Woolworths operated in the main shopping precinct but new premises were obtained at their present location in the late 1980s. An Aldi sits on the other side of the Highway which is part of South Wentworthville.\n\nFor many years \"shopping tours\" were conducted to the Wentworthville area for the factory-outlets selling their products directly to the public. Bonds clothing factory in Dunmore Street sold direct to the public from their factory. Clothing factory closed.\n\nThe most common ancestries in Wentworthville were Indian 26.0%, English 9.7%, Australian 9.4%, Chinese 7.1% and Lebanese 3.8%.\n\n35.4% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were India 26.5%, Sri Lanka 7.8%, China 4.4%, Philippines 2.0% and Lebanon 1.7%. 30.1% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Tamil 11.5%, Gujarati 7.9%, Hindi 7.2%, Punjabi 4.5% and Telugu 4.0%.\n\nThe most common responses for religion were Hinduism 34.9%, Catholic 18.9% and No Religion 11.6%.\n\nWentworthville railway station is on the North Shore, Northern & Western Line of the Sydney Trains network that connects west to Penrith and Richmond. After reaching the city, most trains continue north to North Sydney, Chatswood, Hornsby and Berowra. The station is also serviced by the Cumberland Line linking Blacktown to Campbelltown. The trip to Sydney CBD typically takes 35 minutes.\n\nThe Wentworthville station was the site of the first major Tangara accident, a derailment, which occurred on 27 December 1989 .\n\nEast of Old Prospect Road, the Liverpool-Parramatta T-way runs along the southern boundary.

{"id": "1905278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905278", "title": "Southern Paiute people", "text": "Southern Paiute people\n\nThe Southern Paiute people is a tribe of Native Americans that have lived in the Colorado River basin of southern Nevada, northern Arizona, and southern Utah. Bands of Southern Paiute live in scattered locations throughout this territory and have been granted federal recognition on several reservations.\n\nThe first European contact with the Southern Paiute occurred in 1776, when fathers Silvestre Vélez de Escalante and Francisco Atanasio Domínguez encountered them during an attempt to find an overland route to the missions of California. They noted that some of the Southern Paiute men \"had thick beards and were thought to look more in appearance like Spanish men than native Americans\". Before this date, the Southern Paiute suffered slave raids by the Navajo and the Ute. The arrival of Spanish and later Euro-American explorers into their territory increased slave raiding by other tribes. In 1851, Mormon settlers strategically occupied Paiute water sources, which created a dependency relationship. But, the presence of Mormon settlers soon ended the slave raids, and relations between the Paiutes and the Mormons were basically peaceful. The Mormon missionary Jacob Hamblin worked at diplomatic efforts. The introduction of European settlers and agricultural practices (most especially large herds of cattle) made it difficult for the Southern Paiute to continue their traditional lifestyle, as it drove away the game and reduced their ability to hunt, as well as to gather natural foods.\n\nToday Southern Paiute communities are located at Las Vegas, Pahrump, and Moapa, in Nevada; Cedar City, Kanosh, Koosharem, Shivwits, and Indian Peaks, in Utah; at Kaibab and Willow Springs, in Arizona.\n\nDue to the policies, treaties, and mistreatment experienced by the Southern Paiute, their history is that of tragedy, dependency, and portrays the consequences of US paternalistic policy towards Native American tribes. Yet through it all the Southern Paiutes have portrayed remarkable resilience in preserving their culture, religion, and pride. Even though they've been marginalized and almost decimated from the world population, they managed to make a remarkable retaliation, preserving their priceless culture and heritage.\n\nPrior to the 1850s the Paiute people lived relatively peacefully with the other Native American groups. These groups included the Navajo, Ute, and Hopi tribes. Though there was the occasional tension and violent outbreaks between the two groups, Paiutes were mainly able to live in peace with other tribes and settlers due to their loose social structure. Most Paiutes lived in small familial groups, and only gathered together in large settings for matters of trade and commerce. Prior to the 1850s their biggest antagonist raiders from competing tribes; such as the Navajos, Utes, and Hopis. The Navajos were particularly notorious for intruding on Paiute grazing land and engaging in brutal raids to capture Paiute women and children for slave trade.\n\nThough these raids were harmful, what really crippled the Paiute's was the “settling” of their tribal lands by US citizens. The most prominent groups to migrate to Paiute lands were members and missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and silver miners in Pioche, Nevada. To the Paiute people the settling of their lands not only brought a clash of economies and culture, but also a \"degradation\" of their sacred land. Prior to the 1860s, there had been no long term development of the land. Most of the non-native contact they had was with transient militants or traders. Paiutes fought hard to defend their ancestral lands, and at first were successful in driving the settlers out. But in 1869, a rich investor by the name of François Louis Alfred Pioche poured out investment in that town and it seemingly grew overnight to be a booming mining town. In the beginning of its founding, this town depended upon cheap Paiute labor to work in the mines. This caused a dramatic decline in the Paiute population. Another problem the Paiute people faced with these permanent settlers was their desire to “Americanize” the Paiute children. Paiute children were mandated to attend American schools where it was attempted to eradicate their old cultural traditions and tendencies. They were forced to learn about US history through the eyes of the US historians; causing them to forget their own culture and changing their historical memories of important coinciding events. The Paiutes, a population of thousands of people, rapidly dwindled to be around sparsely 800 people. Due to forced relocation, disease, and forced assimilation as time went on the Southern Paiute people started to disappear from the history books.\n\nIn the 1950s the Paiutes fell victim to \"Indian termination policy\". These policies stripped the Paiutes of their health and educational benefits, federal tax protection, and agricultural assistance. This policy harmed the Paiute people by leaving them on their own in a weak and unstable state. In the 1980s the first attempt of reconciliation was made in the Restoration Act. This act \"legally\" created the \"Paiute Tribe\" in the eyes of the US legislator. It united the five main bands into one tribe; the Cedars, Indian Peaks, Kanosh, Koosharem, and Shivwits, and restored them to a system of federal aid and support.\n\nOne of the most important skills the women of the Paiute tribes had was their basket weaving skills. They would often use red-stemmed willows to weave their baskets. These skills were used in almost every aspect of their lives, and the skill is believed to have been passed down from mother to daughter for at least 9,000 years. When they would go to gather and forage they would carry large conical baskets on their back to collect things. Specific tools were created\n\nincluding ones to strip fruit off of bushes and trees, ones used for winnowing, and ones used to get to roots better. They would also tightly weave these big baskets with clay and resin to create cooking pots and water jugs. Oftentimes, smaller tools were left behind, whereas bigger products such as cooking pots went with the families as they moved around. Based on the region the families were located determined different uses for the weaving. For instance, those who lived by marshes learned to create duck decoys, nets, and rafts to better hunt the water fowl. Another use for this skill was to create their houses. They would use long thin grasses to tightly weave stalks of Cattails together, and in doing so they created these long board-like sections of grasses that they would set up around long willow limbs stuck in the ground.\n\nA staple food for the Southern Paiutes was the Bitter root. They also depended on Wild carrot, Wild onion, and chokecherries. Chokecherries were useful in more ways than one- their stems were brewed to make a sweet drink, and their berries would be crushed, then dried to be saved for later. When Aphids came and swarmed the cane plants, they would leave small drops of nectar where they punctured the cane stalk. Knowing this the Southern Paiute women would take the cane rods and beat them until the small dried droplets came loose. These droplets were then tossed in a winnowing dish to be separated from the remnants of the cane. Often these small particles were the main income of sweetness for the people. Another seed they would gather are waada seeds, minuscule black\n\nOne important aspect of gathering food was the social aspect, often families would come together for foraging and games and then depart and go their different ways. The Southern Paiutes weren't actually split up into tribes, oftentimes their groups were made up of small family units that would occasionally come together with others to socialize. You would have about 10-50 people in each group, and in each group everyone was related to each other. Family ties were really important to these groups—it would often determine where they would go and who would support each other—so marriages were very important to the Southern Paiutes. The leader of the group was called a Headman, and he would be old enough to know a lot about the land, but young enough to still participate in the tribes activities, and he usually had several different family ties within the group. His job was to wake early in the morning, and using his knowledge he would make specific suggestions of what he thought the tribe should do that day, and if people thought his observations were astute they would follow him, if not then they wouldn't. His suggestions would be based on the weather, season, and abundance of food. If over time they stopped following his ideas and instead turned to another, then the Headman leader title would move onto that person. The Headman also was supposed to settle any disputes that came up. Oftentimes different sub-units of the Southern Paiutes would be classified by the settlers coming in from Europe based on what they ate. So you had those who ate waada seeds, those who ate trout, those who ate cattails, etc.\n\nThe Southern Paiute people believe in Puaxant Tuvip, or power land. It is their holy land that links to many significant landmarks in the Southern Paiutes memory and stories. For instance Nuvagantu, or Mt. Charleston in Nevada is a holy landmark that the Southern Paiute people believe was where they were created. These holy lands were places that the separate families or tribes would come to barter, trade, socialize and perform religious ceremonies. Another large landmark that is culturally significant to the Southern Paiutes is the Colorado river and the Grand Canyon. The modern-day importance of these Holy Lands is that the Southern Paiutes claim the supernaturally given right to know what happens and the impacts of any projects that occur in their holy lands.\n\nThe Paiutes have a flag that was officially confirmed in 1997. Within it are several symbolisms for the tribe. First the colors, white symbolizes purity, the red and black are both for strength and power, and the yellow for healing and life. The biggest symbol is the eagle which represents their deity, then there are a\n\nseries of images that relate to traditional songs and games the Southern Paiutes would play, the arrowheads that they were known for. Overall the image is supposed to represent a warrior's shield with the five eagle feathers hanging on the bottom representing the 5 modern-day tribes of the Southern Paiutes.\n\nThe Southern Paiute traditionally had 16 to 31 subgroups, bands, or tribes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1905288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905288", "title": "Swedish American Line", "text": "Swedish American Line\n\nSwedish American Line (, abbreviated SAL) is a Swedish passenger shipping line. It was founded in December 1914 under the name Rederiaktiebolaget Sverige-Nordamerika, beginning ocean liner service from Gothenburg to New York in 1915. In 1925 the company changed its name to Svenska Amerika Linien / Swedish American Line.\n\nThe Swedish American Line was amongst the first companies to build liners with provisions for off-season cruising, as well as the world's first company to build a diesel-engined transatlantic liner. Increased operational costs and stronger competition from aeroplanes forced the company to abandon passenger traffic in 1975, but cargo operations continued until the 1980s.\n\nRederiaktiebolaget Sverige-Nordamerika (literally, \"shipping corporation Sweden-North America\") was born from the idea of Wilhelm R. Lundgren, the owner of Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, with the purpose of offering ocean liner service from Sweden to North America. Both Norway and Denmark already operated their own transatlantic liners, and the establishing of a Swedish company for the trade was a matter of national pride. Lundgren died in September 1914, but his successor Gunnar Carlsson managed to attract the attention of Dan Broström of the Broström Concern, and on 4 December 1914 the new Rederiaktiebolaget Sverige-Nordamerika was founded in Gothenburg. The Broström Concern had already operated freighters across the North Atlantic since 1911 under the name of Swedish American Mexico Line (often abbreviated SAML). Originally the new company had planned to commission two purpose-built 18000-ton ships, but this plan was never realised. Instead, in September 1915 the company acquired the 1900-built Holland America Line vessel SS \"Potsdam\", which was renamed . On 11 December 1915, in the midst of World War I, the \"Stockholm\" left on her first crossing from Gothenburg to New York. En route she was stopped by a British naval vessel and forced to make a stop at Kirkwall, where all mail onboard was confiscated. In the end, the \"Stockholm\"s first transatlantic crossing took no less than 15½ days. Initially the new company concentrated on immigrant trade, with substantial provision made for passengers traveling in steerage. Despite the difficulties caused by the war, the \"Stockholm\" continued transatlantic services until 1917, when Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare forced her to be laid up in Gothenburg until June 1918, when she resumed service.\n\nIn February 1920 RAB Sverige-Nordamerika acquired a second ship, the former Allan Line vessel SS \"Virginian\" from Canadian Pacific Steamships. The ship had most recently been used as a troopship by the British Admiralty. She was renamed and entered service for her new owners on 30 May 1920. In 1922–1923 the \"Drottningholm\" was refurbished, re-engined and her superstructure enlarged. As a partial replacement, the 1902-built SS \"Noordam\" was chartered from Holland America Line as from 27 February 1923 until 18 December 1924. In April 1924 the company acquired , a small coastal steamer that became the first in a series of feeder ships used to transport passengers from ports around the Baltic Sea to Gothenburg.\n\nIn March 1923 RAB Sverige-Nordamerika placed an order for their first newbuilding, the first , with Armstrong Whitworth & Co in Newcastle upon Tyne. She was the first diesel-engined liner to be built for the transatlantic service. The \"Gripsholm\" was launched and christened on 26 November 1924, and delivered on 7 November 1925. On the same date her owners officially changed their name to Svenska Amerika Linien / Swedish American Line, and on 21 November the \"Gripsholm\" set out on her maiden voyage from Gothenburg to New York. Encouraged by the success of the \"Gripsholm\", SAL placed an order for a ship of similar but larger design with the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg on 28 October 1926. In 1927 the company decided to enter the cruise market, offering various cruises during the northern hemisphere winter season.\n\nOn 17 March 1928 the new was launched at Blohm & Voss. The \"Kungsholm\"s interiors were designed with off-season cruising in mind, with her passenger capacity shrunk from 1344 on liner service to around 600 for cruising. She was also one of the first liners with interior decorations in art deco style, following the lead of the , built in 1927. The ship was delivered to SAL on 13 October 1928, and left on her maiden voyage on 24 November 1928. Coinciding with the delivery of the new ship, the first SS \" Stockholm\" was sold to Norwegian interests for conversion to a whale factory ship, SS \"Solglimt\". With the \"Gripsholm\" and \"Kungsholm\" the SAL gained popularity with West European and American passengers, both in liner and cruise service. In May 1929 the United States and Canada imposed extensive restrictions on immigration. At some point after the delivery of the \"Kungsholm\", SAL decided to abandon the traditional black hull colour and their entire fleet was repainted with white hulls.\n\nThe Swedish American Line continued operations with the \"Drottningholm\", \"Gripsholm\" and \"Kungsholm\" throughout the 1930s. In November 1936 the company placed an order for a new ship, , with Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico, Monfalcone, Italy. The planned delivery date for the ship was in March 1939, but she was destroyed by a fire during the final stages of construction on 19 December 1938. Construction of a second ship based on the same design, also named , began soon after the destruction of the original.\n\nDue to World War II breaking out in Europe, the \"Kungsholm\" made her last transatlantic crossing in October 1939, after which she was used for cruising around the West Indies until 1941. Also due to the war the \"Gripsholm\" and \"Drottningholm\" were taken out of service and are laid up on 24 November 1939 and March 1940, respectively. Meanwhile, the construction work continued on the third \"Stockholm\" in Italy, and she was launched on 10 March 1940. In October 1941 the ship was ready for delivery, but due to the war SAL had no service to place her on. As a result, the ship was sold to the Italian government on 3 November 1941 and converted to the troopship MS \"Sabaudia\". The \"Sabaudia\" eventually sunk outside Trieste on 6 July 1944. Had the \"Stockholm\" ever entered service for SAL, she would have been the largest ship ever operated by the company.\n\nIn December 1941 the US Government confiscated the \"Kungsholm\" while she was in New York. After negotiations with the Swedish American Line, the company agreed to sell the ship to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) for $6 million which renamed the ship \"John Ericsson\" for operation under WSA contract by United States Lines with allocation first to the State Department and then in January 1942 to Army troop transportation until 1945 when she was laid up. The \"Drottningholm\" meanwhile was chartered by the US government 4 March 1942 for use as a repatriation vessel, to exchange official personnel between the United States and the Axis powers. As Sweden was a neutral country during the war, the Swedish-flagged ship could be used to transport passengers between the warring nations, under the command of Sea Captain John Nordlander. The \"Drottningsholm\" made two exchange trips for the US government, after which she was chartered for similar use by the British government. In June 1942 the \"Gripsholm\" was also chartered to the US government for the same use as the \"Drottningholm\". For this purpose the \"Gripsholm\" was managed by the American Export Lines but kept her original Swedish crew and flag. Unlike the \"Drottningholm\", the \"Gripsholm\" was chartered to the US government until 1946. Together the \"Drottningholm\" and \"Gripsholm\" made a total of 33 repatriation voyages during the war.\n\nIn October 1944, before the end of World War II, SAL placed an order with the Götaverken shipyard in Gothenburg for a cargo/passenger liner of .\n\nIn March 1946 the Swedish American Line re-commenced commercial service, with the \"Drottningholm\" setting on her first post-war crossing from Gothenburg on 26 March 1946, while the \"Gripsholm\" set out on her corresponding crossing from New York on 31 March 1946. On 9 September 1946 the company's newest ship was launched at the Götaverken shipyard and named . The new \"Stockholm\" was the product of an entirely different thinking from her two predecessors with the same name—instead of offering luxurious surroundings, the new ship was to offer cheap transportation for the masses with austere interiors—despite the protests from the company's chief executive and Stateside offices. During the same year the Swedish American Line founded Home Lines together with Cosulich Lines and the Greek businessman Eugen Eugenides. Additionally the operations of Swedish American Mexico Line were merged into those of the Swedish American Line in 1946, bringing five cargo-carrying ships to the fleet of SAL. On 18 July 1947 Swedish American Line bought back the USS \"John Ericsson\" from the US Navy, and restored her to her original name. The ship sailed to the Ansaldo shipyard in Genoa, where she was rebuilt for service with Home Lines under the name MS \"Italia\".\n\nOn 7 February 1948 the new \"Stockholm\" was delivered to SAL. She set out on her maiden voyage from Gothenburg to New York on 21 February 1948. When the \"Stockholm\" entered service, the \"Drottningholm\" was transferred to South Atlantic Lines (a subsidiary of SAL) and renamed SS \"Brazil\" for traffic with Home Lines. Between 18 December 1949 and 14 February 1950 the \"Gripsholm\" was rebuilt at Howaldtswerke, Kiel with amongst others new funnels, a new bow and modern navigational equipment. In March 1950 the company placed an order for a new combined cruise ship/ocean liner with De Schelde shipyard at Vlissingen, Netherlands. On 18 January 1951 the Swedish American Line re-commenced cruise service for the first time since 1941, when the \"Stockholm\" embarked on a cruise to the West Indies.\n\nThe new ship under construction at De Schelde was launched on 18 October 1952 and named , becoming the third SAL ship to bear the name. The new \"Kungsholm\" was delivered on 30 September 1953, and set out on her maiden voyage from Gothenburg on 24 November 1953. Following the \"Kungsholm\"s delivery the \"Stockholm\" was rebuilt with larger passenger accommodations. Coinciding with the completion of the \"Stockholm\"s refit, the ageing \"Gripsholm\" was sold to the North German Lloyd, becoming their MS \"Berlin\". On 14 September 1954 SAL ordered another new ship, essentially an enlarged version of the most recent \"Kungsholm\", from the Ansaldo shipyard. The new ship was named (the second ship to bear that name in the SAL fleet) and launched on 8 April 1956.\n\nOn 25 July 1956 the \"Stockholm\" collided with the outside Nantucket in one of the most famous maritime disasters of the 20th century. 47 people on the \"Andrea Doria\" were lost, while five members of the \"Stockholm\"s crew were lost in the collision. Several of the \"Andrea Doria\"s passengers were rescued by the \"Stockholm\". She was able to return to New York under her own power, and was subsequently repaired at Bethlehem Steel, returning to service on 5 November 1956. On 14 May 1957 the new \"Gripsholm\" started on her maiden voyage from Gothenburg to New York. For the next three years the company operated with three ships. In May 1959 the \"Stockholm\" was sold to VEB Deutsche Seereederei, East Germany, with a delivery date on 3 January 1960, becoming their MS \"Völkerfreundschaft\".\n\nOn 23 August 1963 the Swedish American Line ordered another new ship, this time from John Brown and Company, Clydebank. The new ship, named (the fourth SAL ship with that name), was launched on 14 April 1964. Her design featured several cruise-friendly innovations, including all-outside cabins and large lido decks. In preparation for the delivery of the new \"Kungsholm\", the old (third) \"Kungsholm\" was sold to North German Lloyd on 5 October 1965, becoming their third MS \"Europa\". The SAL operated with just one passenger-carrying ship until 24 April 1966, when the fourth (and final) \"Kungsholm\" was delivered. She began service with a transatlantic crossing from Gothenburg to New York, after which she was used for cruising around the world. In 1966 SAL's ships made only nine transatlantic crossings. In 1965 SAL had founded Hoverlloyd together with Swedish Lloyd to offer a fast hovercraft connection across the English Channel. Hoverlloyd begun operations in 1966 with two hovercraft, \"Swift\" and \"Sure\". Another joint operation was formed in the mid-60s when SAL, Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic and Wallenius Rederiet founded Atlantic Container Line as a joint marketing entity for transatlantic freight operations. Some time later the decision was made to establish a new company, Swedish Atlantic Line (AB Svenska Atlant Linjen), for Swedish American Line's freight operations. In the early 70s another joint company, Atlantic Gulf Services, was founded, this time in collaboration with Finnlines.\n\nIn 1970 SAL's passenger ships made only three transatlantic crossings, and from 1971 onwards the only crossings made were repositioning cruises. In June 1972 the Swedish American Line purchased the expedition cruise ship via their Panama-based subsidiary United Cruising Co. Unlike other SAL passenger vessels, the \"Lindblad Explorer\" was registered in Panama, not Sweden. Increased operational costs of Swedish-flagged ships forced the company to start negotiations with Swedish trade unions for re-flagging the \"Gripsholm\" and \"Kungsholm\". The negotiations failed however, and 22 March 1975 the company decided to abandon passenger traffic despite protests from the company's United States offices, according to whom the ships would have continued to be highly profitable even under the Swedish flag. The \"Gripsholm\" and \"Kungsholm\" were taken out-of-service and laid up in August 1975. The \"Kungsholm\" was sold to Flagship Cruises in October of the same year for only 65 million Swedish krona, a half of what SAL had paid for her nine years earlier. Flagship maintained her under the name \"Kungsholm\" for cruising under Liberian flag. The \"Gripsholm\" found a buyer in November when she was sold to Karageorgis Lines, Greece, becoming their MS \"Navarino\". The \"Lindblad Explorer\" however stayed under SAL's ownership. At the end of 1975 SAL withdrew from Atlantic Gulf Services.\n\nSAL continued freight operations, maintained their share in Hoverlloyd and ownership of the \"Lindblad Explorer\" until the early 1980s. The \"Lindblad Explorer\" was sold to Lindblad Swire Cruises in 1980, and soon afterwards SAL withdrew from Hoverlloyd. Apparently the last ship owned by the company was sold in 1986. In 1984 the company was bought by competing ship owner Rederi AB Transatlantic, which in turn was bought by transportation company Bilspedition AB in 1988. The last vestiges of SAL disappeared in 1990, when Bilspedition closed down its shipping department.\n\nLists sourced from.\n\n\n"}

Trained at the National Youth Theatre and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London, he portrayed Indiana Jones's father Professor Dr. Henry Jones, Sr. in \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\" between 1992 and 1993 and Paul Bowman-MacDonald in the BBC Scotland series \"Monarch of the Glen\" from 2002 to 2005. He played the role of solicitor William Heelis in the film \"Miss Potter\" (2006). His most recent TV role was playing the US President in \"You, Me and the Apocalypse\" on Sky.\n\nOwen was born on 14 April 1966 at the Charing Cross Hospital in Westminster, London, England. He was brought up in London, although both of his parents were Welsh – his father, actor Glyn Owen (1928–2004), was from Caernarfon, Gwynedd, in north-west Wales, while his mother, actress Patricia Mort, was from Morriston in Swansea, Wales. His sister is the actress Cathy Owen (b. 1968).\n\nOwen said he grew up around \"a mob of entertaining, troublesome, fascinating\" actors involved in challenging the Lord Chamberlain during some of the most exciting days of a very controversial Royal Court Theatre. When he was at Highgate School, because his father was an actor, his teachers thought that he should be able to act, too. However, at first he was not interested. \"I was always made to read plays at school but I never wanted to. Then I was made to take part in a school play and I didn't want to do that either but I started to get approval for my acting. I was reasonably academic, good at sport, but somehow with the acting, people said 'that was fantastic'. So I thought,'Ok, I'll carry on doing this for a bit and the next thing you know that's how I make my living these days\".\n\nAt 16, Owen went straight from school to the National Youth Theatre, and subsequently received some formal training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. While there he managed to get an acting job and an Equity card, but when he told the principal of RADA he needed a term off, the request was denied and he was expelled from the Academy after just a year. Fortunately, Owen landed a job with Cheek by Jowl and followed the theatre company on tour around the world performing Shakespeare plays. Owen has said that he wished he had gone to university, and that he had been \"in too much of a rush\".\n\nOwen played Professor Henry Jones, Sr., father of Indiana Jones, in eight episodes of the TV series \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\" in 1992 and 1993. Subsequently, he appeared in 25 episodes of the popular BBC Scotland series \"Monarch of the Glen\" as Paul Bowman-MacDonald between 2002 and 2005. He also played Professor Jon Ford in the BBC Northern Ireland series \"The Innocence Project\" (2006–2007); however, as a result of poor reviews and falling viewership, the programme was pulled from the schedules in the middle of the first series and no further episodes were filmed.\n\nOwen's film career has included appearances in short films, and supporting roles in \"The Republic of Love\" (2003) (as Peter), which was based on a novel by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Carol Shields, and in \"Miss Potter\" (2006) (as a solicitor named William Heelis who married children's author Beatrix Potter). However, Owen's first love has always been the theatre. Early in his professional career he was involved in the Cheek by Jowl productions of \"Philoctetes\" and the Shakespeare plays \"Macbeth\", \"The Tempest\" and \"Twelfth Night\". Owen's break on stage was playing Nick in Edward Albee's \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" (1962), directed by Howard Davies, at the Almeida Theatre in London in 1996. Owen studied the play during his A-levels, and it is his favourite play. Other highlights of his stage career include playing Dan in \"Closer\" by Patrick Marber in 1998 and George in \"The York Realist\" by Peter Gill in 2002. Critics praised his performance in the latter play as \"astonishing in its power, throttled fury and sadness\" and \"superb, richly voiced\", and called him \"a fast-rising star\".\n\nOwen is a baritone, and speaks fluent French.\n\nOwen is married to actress and artist Juliette Mole, and they have two children.\n\n\n"}

It was fought between the forces of Pyrrhus, king of Epirus in Greece, and the Romans, led by consul Manius Curius Dentatus. It was fought near Beneventum, in southern Italy. It was a strategic (possibly also tactical) Roman victory and Pyrrhus was forced to return to Tarentum, and later to Epirus.\n\nThe Pyrrhic War broke out when Pyrrhus, the king of Epirus, in Greece sailed to southern Italy, ostensibly to aid the Greek city of Tarentum in southern Italy in a dispute with the Romans. Ancient historians agreed that his real motive was the conquest of Italy. Besides the Tarentines, three Italic peoples of southern Italy, the Samnites, Lucani and Bruttii, who were in conflict with the Romans, fought alongside the forces of this Greek king. Pyrrhus won two battles (the Battle of Heraclea and the Battle of Asculum) which were highly wasteful for him because he suffered heavy casualties. He realised that he could not sustain more battles with the Romans. They depleted his forces, whereas the pool of military manpower of the Romans was far superior. Consequently, when he was asked by the Greek city-states of eastern and southern Sicily to help them against the Carthaginians in the western part of the island, he accepted and went to Sicily. This aggrieved his allies in southern Italy, who were left to their own devices against the Romans. Pyrrhus seized all the Carthaginian domains except for Lilybaeum, which he failed to capture. He then decided to build a large fleet to attack the Carthaginians in Africa. In order to man and equip this fleet he treated the Greek city-states despotically. Many of them turned against him. This forced him to leave Sicily and return to Italy.\n\nPlutarch gave the most detailed account of the battle. He wrote that during the three years Pyrrhus spent campaigning in Sicily, the Samnites suffered many defeats at the hands of the Romans and lost a substantial part of their territory. This made them resentful towards Pyrrhus. Therefore, most of them did not join him when he returned to southern Italy. Cassius Dio wrote that the Samnites being hard pressed by the Romans caused Pyrrhus to set forth again to come to their assistance. In Plutarch's account, Pyrrhus engaged the Romans despite the lack of Samnite support. The two consuls for 275 BC, Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Caudinus and Manius Curius Dentatus, were fighting in Lucania and Samnium respectively.\n\nPlutarch wrote that Pyrrhus divided his forces into two divisions. He sent one of them against Cornelius Lentulus and marched with the other force during the night against Manius Curius, who was encamped near Beneventum and was waiting for help from Cornelius Lentulus. Pyrrhus was in a hurry to engage Manius Curius in case his colleague would show up. However, his soldiers lost their way and fell behind because he went a long way round through woods and his lights did not hold out. Dionysius of Halicarnassus wrote that Pyrrhus marched through \"long trails that were not even used by people but were mere goat-paths through woods and crags, would keep no order and, even before the enemy came in sight, would be weakened in body by thirst and fatigue.\" This delayed Pyrrhus and at dawn he was in full view of the enemy as he advanced on them from the heights. Plutarch wrote that Manius Curius led his men out of the camp and attacked the enemy advance guard and captured some elephants which were left behind. This success brought him to the plain, where he could engage Pyrrhus in battle on level ground. He routed some of the enemy lines, but an elephant charge drove him back to his camp. He called on the camp guards who were standing on the parapets of the rampart. They came down and threw javelins at the elephants, forcing them to turn round. They ran through the ranks of Pyrrhus which were thrown into disarray and, as a result, the Romans caused the Epirotes to retreat.\n\nDionysius of Halicarnassus wrote only one sentence about the battle: \"When Pyrrhus and those with him had ascended along with the elephants, and the Romans became aware of it, they wounded an elephant cub, which caused great confusion and flight among the Greeks. The Romans killed two elephants, and hemming eight others in a place that had no outlet, took them alive when the Indian mahouts surrendered them; and they wrought great slaughter among the soldiers.\" \n\nCassius Dio also related the story of the wounded cub. He wrote that Pyrrhus was put to flight because \"a young elephant had been wounded, and shaking off its riders, wandered about in search of its mother, whereupon the latter became excited and the other elephants grew turbulent, so that everything was thrown into dire confusion. Finally, the Romans won the day, killing many men and capturing eight elephants, and they occupied the enemy's entrenchments.\" \n\nMeanwhile, the Greek historian Polybius, determined that the outcome of the battle was unclear, and the historian Justinus (Roman) stated that the Roman army could not defeat Pyrrhus. And, ancient history also writes that the Romans were divided into two divisions and Pyrrhus was defeated by one of the two armies - that is, he had a larger army, but some later authors (Niese and Schubert) refused. that, perhaps the Romans deliberately devised to celebrate their victory at Beneventum.\n\nWe do not have any information about the number of troops deployed by either side or the number of casualties. After this defeat Pyrrhus went back to Tarentum and gave up the war. He sailed back to Epirus.\n\nAt the time of the battle this city still had its original name: Maleventum.\nSix years later (268 BC) the Romans sought to further secure the city and its area by establishing a Roman colony there. The name was changed from Maleventum, a name which the Romans associated with bad omens, as it means ill-come in Latin, to Beneventum, a name, meaning welcome in Latin, which to them had more fortunate connotations.\n\n\n"}

They are also often found in the purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex from postmortem brain samples of rabies victims. They consist of ribonuclear proteins produced by the virus.\n\nThey are named for Adelchi Negri.\n\nAdelchi Negri, an assistant pathologist working in the laboratory of Camillo Golgi, observed these inclusions in rabbits and dogs with rabies. These findings were presented in 1903 at a meeting of the Società Medico-Chirurgica of Pavia. The American pathologist Anna Wessels Williams made the same discovery, but because Negri published his results first, the bodies bear his name.\n\nNegri was convinced the inclusions were a parasitic protozoon and the etiologic agent of rabies. Later that same year, however, Paul Remlinger and Rifat-Bey Frasheri in Constantinople and, separately, Alfonso di Vestea in Naples showed that the etiologic agent of rabies is a filterable virus. Negri continued until 1909 to try to prove that the intraneuronal inclusions named after him corresponded to steps in the developmental cycle of a protozoan. \n\nIn spite of his incorrect etiologic hypothesis, Negri's discovery represented a breakthrough in the rapid diagnosis of rabies, and the detection of Negri bodies, using a method developed by Anna Wessels Williams, remained the primary way to detect rabies for the next thirty years.\n\n"}

He was a member of Crazy Butch's pickpocket gang before joining the Eastman Gang in the late 1890s. \n\nRising up the ranks, Zelig sought control over the fragmented Eastman Gang in 1908, after \"Kid Twist\" (Max Zwerbach) was murdered by a rival. Zelig's crew had more than 75 members, including satellite gangs such as the Lenox Avenue Gang in Harlem, led by \"Gyp the Blood\" (aka Harry Horowitz). During this period, when ethnic Jewish gangsters became predominant in the gang, Zelig was also known as \"The Big Yid\".\n\nAfter Zelig was arrested in 1911 for robbing a brothel, Sirocco and Tricker attempted to gain leadership of the gang by refusing to bail out their boss. Zelig was later released due to his political connections. One of his men told him that Sirocco and Tricker were planning on murdering him. The assassin, a gunman named Julie Morrell, was lured by Zelig to The Stuyvesant Casino where he was killed by the gang leader on December 2, 1911. (That building at 140 Second Avenue is now used as the Ukrainian National Home.)\n\nThe next year, the longstanding Eastman/Five Points feud flared anew. As Zelig left the Criminal Courts building on June 3, 1912, he was shot through the neck by Five Points gunman Charley Torti. He was a known associate of Louis Pioggi, aka Louie the Lump, who had murdered Zelig's mentor, Kid Twist Zwerbach, four years earlier. Zelig had been released on $1000 bail after his arrest for \"shooting up the saloon\" of Pioggi's brother Jake. Zelig recovered from his wound in time to be dragged into the Becker/Rosenthal case.\n\nCharles Becker, a corrupt NYPD lieutenant, had Zelig in his pocket for quite some time. In the summer of 1912, Becker was reported by \"New York World\" as one of three corrupt police officers involved in the affairs of Herman Rosenthal. This small-time bookmaker had complained to the press that his illegal businesses had been badly damaged by the greed of the city's corrupt police officers.\n\nBecker told Jack Zelig and members of the Lenox Avenue Gang, specifically, Harry \"Gyp the Blood\" Horowitz, Jacob \"Whitey Lewis\" Seidenshner, Louis \"Lefty Louie\" Rosenberg, and Francesco \"Dago Frank\" Cirofisi, that he wanted Rosenthal \"croaked\". The gambler was gunned down in front of the Hotel Metropole in Times Square on July 16, 1912, two days after his story appeared in the newspapers. In the aftermath, District Attorney Charles S. Whitman made no secret of his belief that the gangsters who killed him had committed the murder at Becker's behest.\n\nThe fall-out from the Rosenthal murder was huge, making national headlines. All of Big Jack's henchmen were rounded up and charged with murder. It was widely whispered that their boss would testify against them in exchange for leniency.\n\nThe day before he could do so, on October 5, 1912, Zelig was shot behind the ear and killed by \"Boston Red\" Phil Davidson (of 111 E. 7th Street) while riding on a 2nd Avenue trolley car while passing East 13th Street. Zelig was hanging out at Segal's Cafe (76 Second Avenue, now a church), when he received an anonymous phone call requesting his presence on 14th street. Zelig jumped on the uptown trolley; when he stood up at the intersection of 13th street, Davidson approached him and killed him with a police revolver. Zelig was 24 years old. Davidson ran East on 14th Street where he ran into a police officer on beat patrol who made him drop his weapon.\n\nDavidson claimed he had shot Zelig over a $400 grudge, but it was popularly believed he had been killed to keep him from testifying against Charles Becker in the Rosenthal murder case involving the Lenox Avenue Gang.\n\nShortly after Zelig's death New York detective Abe Shoenfeld wrote \"Jack Zelig is as dead as a door nail. Men before him – like Kid Twist, Monk Eastman, and others – were as pygmies to a giant. With the passing of Zelig, one of the most 'nerviest', strongest, and best men of his kind left us.\"\n\n\n"}

This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining streets, sidewalks, water supply networks, sewers, street lighting, municipal solid waste management and disposal, storage depots for various bulk materials used for maintenance and public works (salt, sand, etc.), public parks and cycling infrastructure. \n\nIn the case of underground utility networks, it may also include the civil portion (conduits and access chambers) of the local distribution networks of electrical and telecommunications services. It can also include the optimizing of garbage collection and bus service networks. Some of these disciplines overlap with other civil engineering specialties, however municipal engineering focuses on the coordination of these infrastructure networks and services, as they are often built simultaneously (for a given street or development project), and managed by the same municipal authority.\n\nModern municipal engineering finds its origins in the 19th-century United Kingdom, following the Industrial Revolution and the growth of large industrial cities. The threat to urban populations from epidemics of waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhus led to the development of a profession devoted to \"sanitary science\" that later became \"municipal engineering\".\n\nA key figure of the so-called \"public health movement\" was Edwin Chadwick, author of the parliamentary report, published in 1842.\n\nEarly British legislation included:\n\nThis legislation provided local authorities with powers to undertake municipal engineering projects and to appoint borough surveyors (later known as \"municipal engineers\").\n\nIn the U.K, the Association of Municipal Engineers, (subsequently named Institution of Municipal Engineers), was established in 1874 under the encouragement of the Institution of Civil Engineers, to address the issue of the application of sanitary science. By the early 20th century, Municipal Engineering had become a broad discipline embracing many of the responsibilities undertaken by local authorities, including roads, drainage, flood control, coastal engineering, public health, waste management, street cleaning, water supply, sewers, waste water treatment, crematoria, public baths, slum clearance, town planning, public housing, energy supply, parks, leisure facilities, libraries, town halls and other municipal buildings.\n\nIn the UK, the development of different strands of knowledge necessary for the management of municipal infrastructure led to the emergence of separate specialised institutions, including:\n\nIn 1984 the Institution of Municipal Engineers merged with the Institution of Civil Engineers.\n\nSince the 1970s, there has been a global trend toward increasing privatisation and outsourcing of municipal engineering services.\n\nIn the UK in the 1990s a change in management philosophy brought the demise of the traditional organisational structure of boroughs where the three functions of town clerk, borough treasurer and borough engineer were replaced by an administrative structure with a larger number of specialised departments.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 21st century there was increasing dissatisfaction over what was perceived to be fractured and dysfunctional public services designed along narrow specialties. A more holistic approach to urban engineering began to emerge as an alternative concept. Critics of the specialised approach included the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment that complained that the specialised approach to management of the public realm focussed too much on the on efficient movement of vehicles rather than the more general interests of local communities...GANESH.One of the civil eng.\n\nIn the United Kingdom there is no longer any formal professional qualification in municipal engineering although there are degree courses available in urban engineering.\n\nA professional certificate in Urban Engineering is available from through the Institution of Incorporated Engineers via the Public Realm Information and Advice Network.\n\nThe British Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) caters to practitioners employed in the public sector, private consultancy and academia through its Proceedings Journal Municipal Engineer. The journal, first published in 1873, has a global scope and covers the whole life cycle of municipal services addressing technical, political and community issues. In addition an\nExpert Panel responds on behalf of ICE to Government consultations and is represented on the International Federation of Municipal Engineering.\n\nThe International Federation of Municipal Engineering (IFME) is an organisation comprising professional municipal engineers from all round the world. IFME's mission is to connect municipal engineers, public works professionals, public agencies, institutions and businesses around the world in order that they can share a global pool of knowledge and experience. The aim is to foster continued improvement in the quality of public works and wider community services.\n\nThe inaugural meeting was held in 1960 at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. Membership has grown steadily and in 2009 comprised representatives from national associations in: Australia, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Italy, Israel, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Southern Africa (South Africa, Botawana, Namibia & Zimbabwe), Sweden, UK (England, Scotland, Wales & Northern Ireland) and USA. Belgium and San Marino are presently Corresponding Members.\n\nMunicipal or urban engineering combines elements of environmental engineering, water resources engineering and transport engineering.\n\nToday, municipal engineering may be confused with urban design or urban planning. Whereas the urbanist or urban planner may design the general layout of streets and public places, the municipal engineer is concerned with the detailed design. For example, in the case of the design of a new street, the urbanist may specify the general layout of the street, including landscaping, surface finishings and urban accessories, but the municipal engineer will prepare the detailed plans and specifications for the roads, sidewalks, municipal services and street lighting.\n\nIn the case of large buildings or plants, facilities or campuses, site civil works may be required that are similar in scope or type as municipal infrastructure, namely, access roads, parking lots, potable water supply (including fire hydrants), on-site waste water treatment plants, site drainage including sedimentation and retention ponds or basins, etc. In most engineering consulting firms, Structural Engineering and Municipal Infrastructure are typically separate departments. On a large construction project, the civil engineering design will typically be divided into a structural portion, designed by structural engineers and typically focused on the buildings, and \"civil\" portion, designed by municipal engineers and focused on the site.\n\n\n"}

The network's main competitors are Qurate's HSN and QVC, along with Jewelry Television.\n\nValueVision was founded in June 1990 and began broadcasting in 1991.\n\nIn 2000, NBC purchased a share of the company. In November of that year, ValueVision was rebranded as ShopNBC, including a logo with the NBC peacock.\n\nReports surfaced in 2010 stating NBC would sell its stake in ValueVision, due in part to NBC Universal's pending merger with Comcast. NBCUniversal formally announced that it would sell its stake back to ValueVision Media in May 2010, but ultimately decided in June 2010 to retain its stake in the company.\n\nValueVision acquired NBCUniversal's financial stake in the company in 2013, and announced the network would be renamed ShopHQ (visually branded as SHQP). \"Mark Cuban's American Dream\" aired on the network in 2014, and was part of a plan under the Clinton Group management to feature more celebrity hosts.\n\nOn February 13, 2015, the ShopHQ network was rebranded as EVINE Live, following ValueVision Media's acquisition of e-commerce company Dollars Per Minute, the owner of the EVINE trademark, in order to distance itself from the reputation it held under ValueVision/ShopNBC/ShopHQ. The network hired former QVC host Kathy Levine, and has featured merchandise branded under different reality TV stars, including Lisa Vanderpump and Countess Luann DeLesseps.

When a fuel tank is punctured, the fuel seeps into the layers, causing the untreated layer to swell and thus seal the puncture.\n\nA similar concept is also employed for making self-sealing run-flat tires.\n\nGeorge J. Murdock applied for the patent \"War Aeroplane Fuel Tanks\" on February 7, 1917 but was temporarily blocked by an order of the Federal Trade Commission, on February 6, 1918, to keep any discussion or publication of the invention secret. The order was rescinded by the United States Patent Office on September 26, 1918 and Murdock was eventually granted United States Patent 1,386,791 \"Self-Puncture Sealing Covering for Fuel-Containers\" on August 9, 1921. Military aircraft built by the Glenn L. Martin Company used this self-sealing fuel tank.\n\nHoward Hughes used neoprene to self-seal his fuel tanks on his 1938 around the world flight.\n\nIn the newer generations of pre-war and early-war aircraft, self-sealing tanks were tanks used to minimize the damage from leaking or burning fuel. A conventional fuel tank, when hit by gunfire, could leak fuel rapidly. This would not only reduce the aircraft's effective range, but was also a significant fire hazard. Damaged fuel tanks could also rupture, destroying the airframe or critically affecting flight characteristics.\n\nIt was realized that, because of weight limitations, it was not practical to simply add armor plate to aircraft fuel tanks; a method of stopping fuel leaking from damaged tanks was necessary.\n\nEarly attempts at protecting fuel tanks consisted of using metal tanks, covered inside or outside by a material that expanded after being pierced. Research revealed that the \"exit\" of the projectile, rather than the entry, was the greater problem, as it often tumbled, thus creating a large exit hole. Among the earliest versions of these types of tanks were those manufactured in the UK at Portsmouth airport by Fireproof Tanks Ltd. These tanks were first installed in the Fairey Battle light bomber with other versions installed in Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane fighters and larger aircraft such as the Avro Lancaster heavy bomber. The Henderson Safety Tank company provided crash-proof self-sealing tanks for the Miles Master trainer.\n\nThe Germans were using layers of rubber laid over leather hide with a treated fibre inner surface for the self-sealing tanks on their Junkers Ju 88 bombers early in the war.\nIn the US, Ernst Eger of United States Rubber Company (later Uniroyal) patented a self-sealing fuel tank design in 1941; one of many companies involved in developing this technology during the war. Elmo E Hanson, lead chemist for Firestone Tire and Rubber Company filed a patent for self sealing tanks on January 21, 1941, Patent number 2,404,766. Goodyear chemist James Merrill filed a patent in 1941 (published in 1947) for refining and successfully testing his method for manufacturing self-sealing tanks using a two-layer system of rubber compounds encased in a metal outer shell or the wing lining of the aircraft. In 1942, he received a War Production Board citation from President Roosevelt and the Goodyear tanks were subsequently placed in service in Goodyear-produced Corsair fighters, as well as other aircraft. By 1942 Fireproof Tanks had developed the first flexible fuel bladders as range extender tanks for the Mk IX Spitfire. These tanks were flexible containers, made of a laminated self-sealing material like vulcanized rubber and with as few seams as possible to minimize leak paths.\n\nAs early tests showed that impact could overpressurize a fuel tank, the self-sealing fuel cell is suspended, allowing it to absorb shocks without rupture. U.S. Navy fuel tanks during the war were able to withstand bullets and, on occasion, cannon shells.\n\nNot all fighters were fitted with the relatively new invention. Self-sealing tanks tended to be heavier with lower capacity than non-sealed tanks. Nonetheless, aircraft that were fitted with self-sealing tanks regularly took more punishment than those without, and were able to return to base. Combat experience in the Pacific war showed that the heavily protected American aircraft could sustain far more damage than the lightly armored Japanese designs without self-sealing fuel tanks (for instance, the Mitsubishi A6M Zero).\n\nThe same principles were applied to give self-sealing fuel lines in aircraft (MIL-PRF-7061C).\n\nMost jet fighters and all US military rotary wing aircraft have some type of self-sealing tanks. Military rotary wing fuel tanks have the additional feature of being crashworthy. High altitudes require the tanks to be pressurized, making self-sealing difficult. Newer technologies have brought advances like inert foam-filled tanks to prevent detonation. This foam is an open cell foam that effectively divides the gas space above the remaining fuel into thousands of small spaces, none of which contain sufficient vapour to support combustion. This foam also serves to reduce fuel slosh. Major manufacturers of this technology include Hutchinson, Amfuel (Zodiac) (formerly Firestone), Meggitt (formerly Goodyear), Robertson Fuel Systems, GKN USA, and FPT Industries. FPT is now part of GKN. For military use, tanks are qualified to MIL-DTL-27422 (includes crashworthiness requirements) or MIL-DTL-5578 (non-crashworthy). An aircraft fuel tank sometimes consists of several interconnected fuel cells. The interconnecting hoses are typically also self-sealing.\n\nIn addition to fighter aircraft some military patrol vehicles and armoured VIP limousines feature self-sealing fuel tanks.\nSelf-sealing fuel tanks using military technology are also required in some motorsport categories.\n\n\n"}

It is the busiest privately owned passenger rail service in North America, having transported over one million passengers since 1990.\n\nRocky Mountaineer has been awarded the \"World's Leading Travel Experience by Train\" at the World Travel Awards seven times for its GoldLeaf service and was recognized by National Geographic Magazine as one of the \"World’s Best Journeys\" in 2007. The Society of American Travel Writers, the world's largest organization of professional travel journalists and photographers, rated the Rocky Mountaineer as the world's top train ride in 2009.\n\nRocky Mountaineer operates over 75 railcars in its fleet:\n\nPrevious equipment: GE B36-7 locomotives leased from BC Rail.\n\nRocky Mountaineer operates train journeys over three principal routes:\n\nFirst passage to the West: This route travels along Kicking Horse River, terminating in Banff. Rocky Mountaineer is the only passenger rail service that operates on this route after the cancellation of VIA Rail's southern transcontinental service.\n\nJourney through the clouds: This route travels through the Coastal Mountain Range and the Fraser Canyon. The train follows the route of the Fraser River, then the North Thompson, terminating in Jasper.\n\nRainforest to Gold Rush: This is a three-day route which begins in North Vancouver, with stops in Whistler and Quesnel. The route terminates in Jasper.\n\nOperating on all routes, Rocky Mountaineer's GoldLeaf service is a custom-designed, bi-level, glass-domed coach with full-length windows and reclining seats that can be rotated to accommodate groups of four. Guests onboard this service are attended to by three to four onboard hosts, in addition to the culinary team. Guests are offered hot meals prepared on board the train, served to them in the lower level dining car. Beverages and snacks are also offered to guests throughout the journey. The two levels of the GoldLeaf coach are accessible by a spiral staircase or an ADA elevator.\nOperating on the same routes as GoldLeaf, Rocky Mountaineer's SilverLeaf service is a custom-designed, single level glass domed coach with oversized windows and reclining seats. Guests onboard are attended to by two to three onboard hosts, and offered a hot entrée option for breakfast and lunch served at their seat and plated to their preference. Complimentary beverages are served throughout the journey, including: wine, beer, spirits, and non-alcoholic drinks. Gourmet snacks are also offered throughout the journey.\n\nTo allow for the best views, Rocky Mountaineer operates exclusively during the day. On the First Passage to the West and on Journey Through the Clouds routes an overnight stop is made in Kamloops. On the Rainforest to Gold Rush route, there are two overnight stops in Whistler and Quesnel. The Rocky Mountaineer season runs from mid-April to mid-October with multiple departures every week going both eastbound and westbound.\n\nThe nearest international airports to Rocky Mountaineer are the Calgary International Airport and Vancouver International Airport.\n\nIn Vancouver, Rocky Mountaineer trains depart from the Rocky Mountaineer Station, while other rail services operate out of either Pacific Central Station (Amtrak and Via Rail) or Waterfront Station (West Coast Express).\n\nAt the Jasper railway station passengers can transfer directly to Via Rail's \"Canadian\" and Jasper – Prince Rupert train service.\n\n\n"}

It is a part of Swire's property business, along with Taikoo Place, the adjacent Cityplaza retail and office complex and EAST, a lifestyle business hotel.\n\nTaikoo is the Cantonese pronunciation of Swire's Chinese name, while Shing can be literally translated as City. Thus, Taikoo Shing can be loosely translated as Swire City. According to Swire, its Chinese name Taikoo was chosen by Thomas Taylor Meadow, the British Consul in Shanghai when Swire’s Shanghai office opened in 1866.\n\nThe entire Taikoo Shing estate covers 21.5 hectares (53 acres), and consists of 61 residential towers, with a total of 12,698 apartment flats that ranges anywhere between to .\n\nThe Taikoo Shing estate was once the site of Taikoo Dockyard, whose foundation stone now lies beside Cityplaza. The dockyard moved to United Dockyards at the west shore of the Tsing Yi Island in the late 1970s, and Taikoo Shing was constructed over the site in stages, with constructions of all main residential buildings complete by the early 1990s.\n\nAs part of the business strategy, Swire Properties was established in 1972 immediately after the closing of the dockyard. Taikoo Shing became one of Hong Kong's first major private housing estates. Completing in 1986, Swire immediately became one of the largest property companies doing the construction themselves. The area was designed to maximise middle-class residential capacity.\n\nDevelopment of commercial areas still continues today. After the completion of Cityplaza 3 and 4 as office buildings, the original Cityplaza 1 was demolished in the mid-90s for redevelopment. As of 2007, the food market that was originally constructed was demolished to make room for a hotel.\n\nIn the 2011 census, Taikoo Shing recorded 36,796 residents. The median monthly rent among rental households was $18,000.\n\nApartment flats in Taikoo Shing are popular amongst buyers and speculators, and for a significant time in the 1980s and 1990s, Taikoo Shing's housing price is a general indicator of the Hong Kong's housing market health in general. Although in recent years, newer housing developments have eroded a bit of Taikoo Shing's once prominent status.\n\nThe estate is also a very sought-after place to live for the Japanese and Korean expatriate communities in Hong Kong, most of which are staffed in multinational corporations based in Hong Kong. As a result of this significant Korean and Japanese settlement, the area has many Korean and Japanese-themed service establishments.\n\nThe housing in Taikoo Shing was developed in stages, with the Tsui Woo Terrace being the first ones constructed. In all, the estate's housing complexes are broken down into 6 terraces and 2 gardens, each with a special naming scheme.\n\nIt is important to note that those mansions under the \"garden\" group are considered to be premium housing, and more expensive than those that fall under the \"terrace\" category.\n\nTsui Woo Terrace (, literally: \"Terrace of the Jade Lake\"); all of the mansions on this terrace are named after famous lakes in China. The terrace consists of three mansions.\n\nKo Shan Terrace (, literally: \"Terrace of the High Mountain\"); all of the mansions on this terrace have the Chinese word for \"Mountain\" (山) as the second character of the building's name. A couple of the mansion's names also corresponds to famous mountains in China. The terrace consists of 13 mansions.\n\nKam Din Terrace (, literally: \"Terrace of the Golden Palace\"); all of the mansions on this terrace have the Chinese word for \"Palace\" (宮) as the second character of the building's name. In addition, all of the mansions names' first character corresponds to various political dynasties in Chinese history. The terrace consists of 8 mansions.\n\nOn Shing Terrace (, literally: \"Terrace of Peace and Prosperity\"); all of the mansions on this terrace have the Chinese word for \"Peace\" (安) as the second character of the building's name. The terrace consists of 6 mansions.\n\nHarbour View Gardens (); all of the mansions in this area are named after flora. The area consists of 11 mansions.\n\nKwun Hoi Terrace (, literally: \"Terrace for Ocean Viewing\"); all of the mansions on this terrace have the Chinese word for \"Ocean\" (海) as the second character of the building's name, and a cardinal direction as the first character of the building's name. The terrace consists of 3 mansions.\n\nSing Fai Terrace (, literally: \"Terrace of the Stars\"); all of the mansions on this terrace have the Chinese word for \"star\" (星) as the second character of the building's name. Some of the building names are similar to Chinese names for planets within the Solar System. The terrace consists of 8 mansions.\n\nHorizon Garden (); all of the mansions on this terrace have the Chinese word for \"sky\" (天) as the second character of the building's name. The area consists of 9 mansions.\n\nSome terraces - Horizon Gardens, Kam Din Terrace, Sing Fai Terrace, and Kao Shan Terrace - have podiums that provide a public space for their residents, often including a children's playground. Elderly residents may practice t'ai chi in the mornings. There are also shops and learning centres on these podiums such as Kumon.\n\nIn addition, Harbour View Gardens, Horizon Gardens and Kwun Hoi Terrace all have access to swimming pools. In Kao Shan Terrace, there are badminton courts and tennis courts for residents to use.\n\nThere are a few kindergartens in the vicinity of Tai Koo Shing, as well as the international school Delia School of Canada.\n\nAll terraces have indoor car parks, providing parking spaces on monthly lease.\n\nThere are parking spaces available for visitors on hourly rate in the car parks at Cityplaza and Sing Fai Terrace.\n\nThe estate is served by MTR Tai Koo station of the Island Line, as well as various bus lines, served by New World First Bus and the Kowloon Motor Bus to Shau Kei Wan, Admiralty, Sheung Wan, Tsim Sha Tsui and Jordan.\n\nAs it is a private estate, all roads were owned by Swire Properties. However, most roads were returned to the Government except for those near Cityplaza. In practice, public traffic is generally allowed to pass freely, but admission may be denied.\n\n\nThe archives of the Taikoo Dockyard are held by SOAS Archives\n\n"}
{"id": "1905371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905371", "title": "Schrödinger–Newton equation", "text": "Schrödinger–Newton equation\n\nThe Schrödinger–Newton equation, sometimes referred to as the Newton–Schrödinger or Schrödinger–Poisson equation, is a nonlinear modification of the Schrödinger equation with a Newtonian gravitational potential, where the gravitational potential emerges from the treatment of the wave function as a mass density, including a term that represents interaction of a particle with its own gravitational field. The inclusion of a self-interaction term represents a fundamental alteration of quantum mechanics. It can be written either as a single integro-differential equation or as a coupled system of a Schrödinger and a Poisson equation. In the latter case it is also referred to in the plural form.\n\nThe Schrödinger–Newton equation was first considered by Ruffini and Bonazzola in connection with self-gravitating boson stars. In this context of classical general relativity it appears as the non-relativistic limit of either the Klein–Gordon equation or the Dirac equation in a curved space-time together with the Einstein field equations.\nThe equation also describes fuzzy dark matter, and approximates classical cold dark matter described by the Vlasov-Poisson equation in the limit that the particle mass is large.\n\nLater on it was proposed as a model to explain the quantum wave function collapse by Lajos Diósi and Roger Penrose, from whom the name \"Schrödinger–Newton equation\" originates. In this context, matter has quantum properties while gravity remains classical even at the fundamental level. The Schrödinger–Newton equation was therefore also suggested as a way to test the necessity of quantum gravity.\n\nIn a third context, the Schrödinger–Newton equation appears as a Hartree approximation for the mutual gravitational interaction in a system of a large number of particles. In this context, a corresponding equation for the electromagnetic Coulomb interaction was suggested by Philippe Choquard at the 1976 Symposium on Coulomb Systems in Lausanne to describe one-component plasmas. Elliott H. Lieb provided the proof for the existence and uniqueness of a stationary ground state and referred to the equation as the Choquard equation.\n\nAs a coupled system, the Schrödinger–Newton equations are the usual Schrödinger equation with a self-interaction gravitational potential\nwhere V is an ordinary potential and the gravitational potential formula_2, representing the interaction of the particle with its own gravitational field, satisfies the Poisson equation\nBecause of the back coupling of the wave-function into the potential it is a nonlinear system.\n\nThe integro-differential form of the equation is\nIt is obtained from the above system of equations by integration of the Poisson equation under the assumption that the potential must vanish at infinity.\n\nMathematically, the Schrödinger–Newton equation is a special case of the Hartree equation for n = 2. The equation retains most of the properties of the linear Schrödinger equation. In particular it is invariant under constant phase shifts, leading to conservation of probability, and it exhibits full Galilei invariance. In addition to these symmetries, a simultaneous transformation\nmaps solutions of the Schrödinger–Newton equation to solutions.\nThe stationary equation, which can be obtained in the usual manner via a separation of variables, possesses an infinite family of normalisable solutions of which only the stationary ground state is stable.\n\nThe Schrödinger–Newton equation can be derived under the assumption that gravity remains classical, even at the fundamental level, and that the right way to couple quantum matter to gravity is by means of the semiclassical Einstein equations. In this case, a Newtonian gravitational potential term is added to the Schrödinger equation, where the source of this gravitational potential is the expectation value of the mass density operator. In this regard, \"if\" gravity is fundamentally classical, the Schrödinger–Newton equation is a fundamental one-particle equation, which can be generalised to the case of many particles (see below).\n\nIf, on the other hand, the gravitational field is quantised, the fundamental Schrödinger equation remains linear. The Schrödinger–Newton equation is then only valid as an approximation for the gravitational interaction in systems of a large number of particles, and has no effect on the centre of mass.\n\nIf the Schrödinger–Newton equation is considered as a fundamental equation, there is a corresponding N-body equation that was already given by Diósi, and can be derived from semiclassical gravity in the same way as the one-particle equation:\nwhere M is the total mass, R is the relative coordinate, formula_7 the centre-of-mass wave-function, and formula_8 is the mass density of the many-body system (e.g. a molecule or a rock) relative to its centre of mass.\n\nIn the limiting case of a wide wave-function, i.e. where the width of the centre-of-mass distribution is large compared to the size of the considered object, the centre-of-mass motion is approximated well by the Schrödinger–Newton equation for a single particle. The opposite case of a narrow wave-function can be approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential, where the Schrödinger–Newton dynamics leads to a rotation in phase space.\n\nIn the context where the Schrödinger–Newton equation appears as a Hartree approximation, the situation is different. In this case the full N-particle wave-function is considered a product state of N single-particle wave-functions, where each of those factors obeys the Schrödinger–Newton equation. The dynamics of the centre-of-mass, however, remain strictly linear in this picture. This is true in general: nonlinear Hartree equations never have an influence on the centre of mass.\n\nA rough order-of-magnitude estimate of the regime where effects of the Schrödinger–Newton equation become relevant can be obtained by a rather simple reasoning. For a spherically-symmetric Gaussian,\nthe free linear Schrödinger equation has the solution\nThe peak of the radial probability density formula_11 can be found at\nNow we set the acceleration\nof this peak probability equal to the acceleration due to Newtonian gravity,\nusing that formula_15 at time formula_16. This yields the relation\nwhich allows us to determine a critical width for a given mass value and vice versa. We also recognise the scaling law mentioned above. Numerical simulations show that this equation gives a rather good estimate of the regime where effects of the Schrödinger–Newton equation become significant.\n\nFor an atom the critical width is around 10 metres, while it is already down to 10 metres for a mass of one microgram. The regime where the mass is around 10 atomic mass units while the width is of the order of micrometers is expected to allow for an experimental test of the Schrödinger–Newton equation in the future. A possible candidate are interferometry experiments with heavy molecules, which currently reach masses up to 10,000 atomic mass units.\n\nThe idea that gravity causes (or somehow influences) the wavefunction collapse dates back to the 1960s and was originally proposed by Károlyházy.\nThe Schrödinger–Newton equation was proposed in this context by Diósi. There the equation provides an estimation for the \"line of demarcation\" between microscopic (quantum) and macroscopic (classical) objects. The stationary ground state has a width of\nFor a well-localised homogeneous sphere, i.e. a sphere with a centre-of-mass wave-function that is narrow compared to the radius of the sphere, Diósi finds as an estimate for the width of the ground-state centre-of-mass wave-function\nAssuming a usual density around 1000 kg/m³, a critical radius can be calculated for which formula_20. This critical radius is around a tenth of a micrometer.\n\nRoger Penrose proposed that the Schrödinger–Newton equation mathematically describes the basis states involved in a gravitationally induced wavefunction collapse scheme. Penrose suggests that a superposition of two or more quantum states which have a significant amount of mass displacement ought to be unstable and reduce to one of the states within a finite time. He hypothesises that there exists a \"preferred\" set of states which could collapse no further, specifically the stationary states of the Schrödinger–Newton equation. A macroscopic system can therefore never be in a spatial superposition since the nonlinear gravitational self-interaction immediately leads to a collapse to a stationary state of the Schrödinger–Newton equation. According to Penrose's idea, when a quantum particle is measured, there is an interplay of this nonlinear collapse and environmental decoherence. The gravitational interaction leads to the reduction of the environment to one distinct state and decoherence leads to the localisation of the particle, e.g. as a dot on a screen.\n\nThree major problems occur with this interpretation of the Schrödinger–Newton equation as the cause of the wave-function collapse. First, numerical studies agreeingly find that when a wave packet \"collapses\" to a stationary solution, a small portion of it seems to run away to infinity. This would mean that even a completely collapsed quantum system still can be found at a distant location. Since the solutions of the linear Schrödinger equation tend towards infinity even faster, this only indicates that the Schrödinger–Newton equation alone is not sufficient to explain the wave-function collapse. If the environment is taken into account, this effect might disappear and therefore not be present in the scenario described by Penrose.\n\nA second problem, also arising in Penrose's proposal, is the origin of the Born rule. To solve the measurement problem, a mere explanation why a wave-function collapses to, e.g., a dot on a screen is not enough. A good model for the collapse process also has to explain why the dot appears on different positions of the screen with probabilities that are determined by the absolute-value squared of the wave-function. Although it might be possible that a model based on Penrose's idea could provide such an explanation, there is no evident way how the Born rule could arise naturally from it.\n\nFinally, since the gravitational potential is linked to the wave-function in the picture of the Schrödinger–Newton equation, the wave-function must be interpreted as a real object. Therefore, at least in principle, it becomes a measurable quantity. Making use of the nonlocal nature of entangled quantum systems, this could be used to send signals faster than light, which is generally thought to be in contradiction with causality. It is, however, not clear if this problem can be resolved by applying the right collapse prescription, yet to be found, consistently to the full quantum system. Also, since gravity is such a weak interaction, it is not clear that such an experiment can be actually performed within the parameters given in our universe (cf. the discussion about a similar thought experiment proposed by Eppley and Hannah).\n\n"}
{"id": "1905372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905372", "title": "Brownist", "text": "Brownist\n\nThe Brownists were a group of English Dissenters or early Separatists from the Church of England. They were named after Robert Browne, who was born at Tolethorpe Hall in Rutland, England, in the 1550s. A majority of the Separatists aboard the \"Mayflower\" in 1620 were Brownists, and indeed the Pilgrims were known for 200 years as the Brownist Emigration.\n\nThere had been early advocates of a congregational form of organization for the Church of England in the time of Henry VIII. It became clear that the English government had other plans on the re-establishment of the Anglican Church, after the Catholic Mary's reign, and these dissenters looked towards setting up a separate church.\n\nThe first wave of separatism from the Elizabethan Church of England came in London after March 1566, when Archbishop Parker enforced strict adherence to the Prayer Book and 14 ministers were deprived. Some of the most radical led their followers in forming the London Underground Church, meeting in secret locations. From possibly a thousand members at its height, this movement shrank, through imprisonment and deaths, to a small group of members in Browne's days. He and Harrison knew of the London church, but seem to have believed it had died.\n\nRobert Browne (d. 1633) was a student who became an Anglican priest late in life. At Cambridge University, he was influenced by Puritan theologians, including Thomas Cartwright (1535-1603).\n\nBrowne became a Lecturer at St Mary's Church, Islington where his dissident preaching against the doctrines and disciplines of the Church of England began to attract attention. During 1578, Browne returned to Cambridge University and came under the influence of Richard Greenham, puritan rector of Dry Drayton. He encouraged Browne to complete his ordination and serve at a parish church. Browne was offered a lecturer position at St Bene't's Church, Cambridge possibly through Greenham, but his tenure there was short. Browne came to reject the puritan view of reform from within the Church, and started to look outside the established Church.\n\nIn 1581, Browne had become the leader of this movement and, in Norwich, attempted to set up a separate Congregational Church outside the Church of England. He was arrested but released on the advice of William Cecil, his kinsman. Browne and his companions left England and moved to Middelburg in the Netherlands later in 1581. There they organised a church on what they conceived to be the New Testament model, but the community broke up within two years owing to internal dissensions.\n\nHis most important works were published at Middelburg in 1582: \"A Treatise of Reformation without Tarying for Anie\", in which he asserted the right of the church to effect necessary reforms without the authorisation of the civil magistrate; and \"A Booke which sheweth the life and manners of all True Christians\", which set out the theory of Congregational independence. Two men were hanged at Bury St Edmunds in 1583 for circulating them.\n\nBrowne was only an active Separatist from 1579-1585. He returned to England and to the Church of England, being employed as a schoolmaster and, after 1591, a Church of England parish priest. He was much engaged in controversy with some of those who held his earlier separatist position and who now looked upon him as a renegade. In particular, he replied to John Greenwood and Henry Barrowe several times.\n\nHe is buried in St Giles's churchyard, Northampton.\n\nThe Brownist movement revived in London from around 1587, led by Henry Barrow and John Greenwood. Both were arrested in 1587 and kept in prison until their execution in 1593. They wrote numerous books of Brownist theology and polemic in secret during their imprisonment, which were smuggled out by their followers and printed in the Netherlands, the most important being Barrow's \"A Brief Discoverie of the False Church\". Dozens of other Brownists were imprisoned and many of them died in jail. \n\nAfter the execution of Barrow and Greenwood, the Brownist church was led by Francis Johnson. As a puritan minister, Johnson had been given the job of burning Brownist books, but kept one back for himself and was converted by it. To escape the fate of Barrow and Greenwood, the Brownists made an abortive attempt to settle in Newfoundland, before going into exile in Amsterdam. There the church was co-led by Henry Ainsworth and became known as the Ancient Church. Johnson and Ainsworth printed numerous works in Amsterdam which were smuggled into England. \n\nAnother wave of Brownism resulted from Archbishop Richard Bancroft's campaign against puritanism from 1604. John Robinson and John Smyth founded Brownist congregations in the north of England and then led them to Amsterdam around 1608. This was the high point of the movement, with three sizeable Brownist churches, on good terms with each other, in one city. Smyth, however, broke away from Brownism to form the first Baptist church, Robinson responded by removing his church to Leiden, while Johnson and Ainsworth quarrelled with each other and formed congregations. \n\nJohnson took his faction to Virginia, but few survived the journey. Smyth's church joined the Mennonites, while a group of Baptists returned to London led by Thomas Helwys. Half of Robinson's church sailed on the Mayflower to New England.\n\nThe Brownists are mentioned in Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\", believed to have been written around 1600–02, in which Andrew Aguecheek says, \"I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician\" (III, ii). The Browne family seat of Tolethorpe Hall is now home to the Stamford Shakespeare Company.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1905375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905375", "title": "Operation Unthinkable", "text": "Operation Unthinkable\n\nOperation Unthinkable was the name given to two related but unrealised plans by the Western Allies against the Soviet Union. The creation of these plans was ordered by British prime minister Winston Churchill in 1945 and developed by the British Armed Forces' Joint Planning Staff at the end of World War II in Europe.\n\nThe first of the two assumed a surprise attack on the Soviet forces stationed in Germany in order to \"impose the will of the Western Allies\" on the Soviets. \"The will\" was qualified as \"a square deal for Poland\" – which probably meant enforcing the recently signed Yalta Agreement. When the odds were judged \"fanciful\", the original plan was abandoned. The code name was used instead for a defensive scenario, in which the British were to defend against a Soviet drive towards the North Sea and the Atlantic following the withdrawal of the American forces from the continent.\n\nThe study became the first Cold War-era contingency plan for war with the Soviet Union. Both plans were highly secret at the time of their creation and it was not until 1998 that they were made public, although a British spy for the Soviets, Guy Burgess, had passed on some details at the time.\n\nThe initial primary goal of the operation was declared as \"to impose upon Russia the will of the United States and the British Empire. Even though 'the will' of these two countries may be defined as no more than a square deal for Poland, that does not necessarily limit the military commitment\". (The Soviet Union is referred to as \"Russia\" throughout the document, a metonym common in the West during the Cold War.)\n\nThe chiefs of staff were concerned that given the enormous size of Soviet forces deployed in Europe at the end of the war, and the perception that the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was unreliable, there existed a Soviet threat to Western Europe. The Soviet Union had yet to launch its attack on Japanese forces, and so one assumption in the report was that the Soviet Union would instead ally with Japan if the Western Allies commenced hostilities.\n\nThe hypothetical date for the start of the Allied invasion of Soviet-held Europe was scheduled for 1 July 1945, four days before the UK general election. The plan assumed a surprise attack by up to 47 British and American divisions in the area of Dresden, in the middle of Soviet lines. This represented almost half of the roughly 100 divisions available to the British, American and Canadian headquarters at that time.\n\nThe plan was taken by the British Chiefs of Staff Committee as militarily unfeasible due to an anticipated 2.5 to 1 superiority in divisions of Soviet land forces in Europe and the Middle East by 1 July, where the conflict was projected to take place. The majority of any offensive operation would have been undertaken by American and British forces, as well as Polish forces and up to 10 divisions of the former German Wehrmacht, re-mobilized from POW status. Any quick success would be due to surprise alone. If a quick success could not be obtained before the onset of winter, the assessment was that the Allies would be committed to a protracted total war. In the report of 22 May 1945, an offensive operation was deemed \"hazardous\".\n\nIn response to an instruction by Churchill of 10 June 1945, a follow-up report was written concerning \"what measures would be required to ensure the security of the British Isles in the event of war with Russia in the near future\". United States forces were relocating to the Pacific for a planned invasion of Japan, and Churchill was concerned that this reduction in supporting forces would leave the Soviets in a strong position to take offensive action in Western Europe. The report concluded that if the United States focused on the Pacific Theatre, Great Britain's odds \"would become fanciful.\"\n\nThe Joint Planning Staff rejected Churchill's notion of retaining bridgeheads on the continent as having no operational advantage. It was envisaged that Britain would use its air force and navy to resist, although a threat from mass rocket attack was anticipated, with no means of resistance except for strategic bombing.\n\nBy 1946, tensions and conflicts were developing between Allied-occupied and Soviet-occupied areas of Europe. These were seen as being potential triggers for a wider conflict. One such area was the Julian March (an area of southeastern Europe, today split among Croatia, Slovenia, and Italy), and on 30 August 1946 informal discussions took place between the British and US chiefs of staff concerning how such a conflict could develop and the best strategy for conducting a European war. Again the issue of retaining a bridgehead on the continent was discussed, with Dwight D. Eisenhower preferring a withdrawal to the Low Countries, rather than Italy, for their proximity to the United Kingdom.\n\nIn June 1945 senior Soviet Army commander Marshal Georgi Zhukov suddenly ordered Soviet forces in Poland to regroup and prepare their positions for defence. According to Edinburgh University professor John Erickson, Operation Unthinkable helps to explain why he did it. Had the plans of the operation been transmitted to Moscow by the Cambridge Five it would explain the sudden orders to regroup and prepare for defence, however, it is just as possible that it was Soviet mistrust of Western Allies. If the Soviets had indeed known that the Western Allies were planning a possible attack, the element of surprise would have been lost before operations against the Soviets even began, further reducing the chances of Operation Unthinkable's success.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1905392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905392", "title": "Pontifical North American College", "text": "Pontifical North American College\n\nThe Pontifical North American College is a Roman Catholic educational institution in Rome, Italy, that forms seminarians for priestly ministry in the dioceses of the United States and elsewhere, and that provides a residence for priests from the United States and elsewhere who are pursuing graduate studies or continuing formation programs in Rome. Oversight of the college is the responsibility of the Holy See's Congregation for the Clergy, which is delegated for most matters to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops acting through the college's episcopal board of governors.\n\nThe North American College was founded in 1859 by Pope Pius IX. As the college's founder, Pope Pius ensured that the new college would have a suitable home in a former Dominican and Visitation convent on the Via dell'Umiltà, near the Trevi Fountain. He knew the property well, since he used to serve Mass there for the Visitation sisters as a young boy. The college was opened ceremonially on 8 December 1859, and the new foundation received a formal visit from the pope on 29 January 1860. This original campus is still owned by the College and called the Casa Santa Maria.\n\nIt was granted pontifical status by Pope Leo XIII in 1884, and was incorporated in the United States by a special act of the Maryland General Assembly in 1886 as a non-stock (not-for-profit) corporation under the name \"The American College of the Roman Catholic Church of the United States.\" This is its official name for the purposes of United States federal and state law, and for such things as contributions and bequests. The college is exempt from United States federal taxation, and contributions to it are deductible by the donor to the extent provided in United States federal tax law and regulations and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\nUntil the outbreak of the Second World War, all the college's students resided at the old campus in the heart of the city. During the war, the various national seminaries in Rome were temporarily closed by Pope Pius XII and non-Italian students returned to their home countries. When the war ended and the seminaries re-opened, the Catholic Church in the United States had experienced such an increase in vocations to the priesthood that the old campus could no longer accommodate the many seminarians whom United States bishops wanted to send to Rome for their priestly formation and university studies. To respond to that situation, the Roman Catholic bishops of the United States authorized construction of a new seminary complex on the Janiculum Hill overlooking the Vatican. The complex was built on the grounds of Villa Gabrielli al Gianicolo, land the bishops had purchased in 1926.\n\nPope Pius XII dedicated the newly built seminary complex on 14 October 1953. The Casa Santa Maria then became a residence for ordained American Catholic priests pursuing advanced studies in Rome. In 2009 and 2010, a historic eighteenth-century residence on the Janiculum Hill campus was renovated to provide a new home, the Casa O'Toole, for the college's Institute for Continuing Theological Education, a continuing formation program for priests ordained ten years or more. In addition, a new convent was built for the religious sisters who make up part of the college's staff. In January 2015 the college opened a newly constructed tower on the main Janiculum Hill building. The new construction houses classrooms, gathering space, liturgical practice chapels, and administrative offices.\n\nOn 23 November 2015, the Congregation for the Clergy announced the appointment of Peter Harman of Springfield, Illinois, to succeed James F. Checchio as the college's rector, effective on 1 February 2016.\n\nThe college has four departments: a Seminary, which prepares candidates for the Catholic priesthood; the Casa Santa Maria, a residence for Catholic priests pursuing graduate studies; the Institute for Continuing Theological Education, located in the Casa O'Toole on the grounds of the Seminary; and the Bishops' Office for U.S. Visitors to the Vatican, which serves pilgrims who come to Rome from the United States, as well as persons who travel to Rome from the United States on college or Holy See matters, particularly members of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The college has welcomed many visitors, including four popes, two presidents of the United States (Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy), and the evangelist Billy Graham.\n\nThe board of governors of the college consists of one diocesan or auxiliary bishop from each of the fifteen regions into which the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops is divided. the Chairman of the Board of Governors and President of the college is John J. Myers, Archbishop of Newark, and the Rector of the college is Peter Harman, a priest of the Diocese of Springfield in Illinois.\n\nFor the 2014–2015 academic year, enrollment in the Seminary is approximately 250, at the Casa Santa Maria approximately 75; and at each of several continuing formation sessions, approximately 30.\n\nEnrollment in the college is available to properly qualified Catholic seminarians and priests who are studying for a diocese in the United States, nominated for such enrollment by a diocesan bishop of the United States, and approved for enrollment by the Rector. Enrollment of students who are studying for non-American dioceses or who are not American citizens is by decision of the board. At present, a number of Australian seminarians are enrolled in the Seminary Division, and several priests of non-United States nationality are resident at the Casa Santa Maria or are enrolled in the college's continuing formation program. For their academic formation, the students of all departments may, as approved by their bishop and the Board of Governors, attend any pontifical university or other educational institution approved by the Holy See. Human, pastoral, and spiritual formation is provided by the faculty of the college.\n\nIn addition to their academic and pastoral activities, the students at the college participate in athletic competitions with students from other Roman ecclesiastical institutions. Since 2007, the college has competed in an annual soccer tournament among Roman Colleges, called the Clericus Cup. The college's team, nicknamed the \"North American Martyrs\", won the championship in 2012, 2013 and 2018 and was runner-up in 2009 and 2010.\n\n"}

Torborg was signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers as an amateur free agent in 1963. On September 9, 1965, Torborg caught Sandy Koufax's perfect game. On July 20, 1970, he was the catcher receiving Bill Singer's no-hitter, and on May 15, 1973, Torborg also caught the first of Nolan Ryan's seven no-hitters.\n\nTorborg grew up in Westfield, New Jersey, where he was the catcher on the Westfield High School baseball team. He caught at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He was a 1963 All-American, setting the school record for season batting average; his .537 batting average was the highest for 100 at-bats and under. His .537 average was the highest ever recorded up to that time and since then, only two college players have hit for a better average. His slugging percentage that year (1.032) is also a single-season standard. He led the team with 21 RBI and six home runs. In his three-year career from 1961–63, the Torborg batted .390. His number (#10) was retired in 1992. He still holds the career slugging percentage mark of .684. During his career, the Knights were 15–4–1, 14–4 and 11–5 for a three-year mark of 40–13–1 (.741 winning percentage).\n\nAfter a successful ten-year career as a catcher with the Dodgers and Angels, Torborg switched to coaching. In 1977, he became the manager of the Cleveland Indians (a position he held for three years). He was a coach on the Yankees from 1979 to 1988. In 1989, Torborg left the Yankees to become the manager of the Chicago White Sox. A year after he took the helm, the White Sox won 94 games, which was a 25-game improvement from the team's 1989 season. For his efforts with the 1990 White Sox, Torborg won the American League Manager of the Year Award. Torborg would stay with the White Sox for one more year before moving to the New York Mets.\n\nTorborg wasn't as successful with the Mets as he was with the White Sox. A year after leading the White Sox to an 87–75 record, Torborg's 1992 New York Mets posted a 70–92 record. After starting the 1993 season with a 13–25 record, the Mets fired Torborg and replaced him with Dallas Green.\n\nFor the rest of the 1990s, Torborg kept busy working as a sportscaster for the likes of CBS Radio and Fox. Torborg returned to managing, first with the Montreal Expos in 2001 and then the Florida Marlins in 2002.\n\nIn 2003, Torborg was fired from the Florida Marlins after they started off the season with a 16–22 record. Jack McKeon was hired to replace him and led the team to a 2003 World Series victory. Torborg then returned to broadcasting for Fox. He served as the color commentator for Atlanta Braves games on FSN South and Turner South in 2006, where he was partnered with Bob Rathbun. However, neither Torborg nor Rathbun was retained for the 2007 season.\n\nTorborg is of Danish descent. His son, Dale, is a former professional wrestler and his daughter-in-law, Christi Wolf, is a bodybuilder and former professional wrestler.\n\nFor more than 25 years, Torborg lived with his family in a home in Mountainside, New Jersey.\n\nTorborg currently has Parkinson's and no longer signs autographs.\n\n"}
{"id": "1905405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905405", "title": "Differential GPS", "text": "Differential GPS\n\nA Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) is an enhancement to the Global Positioning System (GPS) which provides improved location accuracy, in the range of operations of each system, from the 15-meter nominal GPS accuracy to about 1-3 cm in case of the best implementations.\n\nEach DGPS uses a network of fixed ground-based reference stations to broadcast the difference between the positions indicated by the GPS satellite system and known fixed positions. These stations broadcast the difference between the measured satellite pseudoranges and actual (internally computed) pseudoranges, and receiver stations may correct their pseudoranges by the same amount. The digital correction signal is typically broadcast locally over ground-based transmitters of shorter range.\n\nThe United States Coast Guard (USCG) and the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) each run DGPSes in the United States and Canada on longwave radio frequencies between 285 kHz and 325 kHz near major waterways and harbors. The USCG's DGPS was named NDGPS (Nationwide DGPS) and was jointly administered by the Coast Guard and the U.S. Department of Defense's Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). It consisted of broadcast sites located throughout the inland and coastal portions of the United States including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Other countries have their own DGPS.\n\nA similar system which transmits corrections from orbiting satellites instead of ground-based transmitters is called a Wide-Area DGPS (WADGPS) or Satellite Based Augmentation System.\n\nWhen GPS was first being put into service, the US military was concerned about the possibility of enemy forces using the globally available GPS signals to guide their own weapon systems. Originally, the government thought the \"coarse acquisition\" (C/A) signal would give only about 100-meter accuracy, but with improved receiver designs, the actual accuracy was 20 to 30 meters. Starting in March 1990, to avoid providing such unexpected accuracy, the C/A signal transmitted on the L1 frequency (1575.42 MHz) was deliberately degraded by offsetting its clock signal by a random amount, equivalent to about 100 meters of distance. This technique, known as \"Selective Availability\", or SA for short, seriously degraded the usefulness of the GPS signal for non-military users. More accurate guidance was possible for users of dual-frequency GPS receivers which also received the L2 frequency (1227.6 MHz), but the L2 transmission, intended for military use, was encrypted and was available only to authorized users with the decryption keys.\n\nThis presented a problem for civilian users who relied upon ground-based radio navigation systems such as LORAN, VOR and NDB systems costing millions of dollars each year to maintain. The advent of a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) could provide greatly improved accuracy and performance at a fraction of the cost. The accuracy inherent in the S/A signal was however too poor to make this realistic. The military received multiple requests from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), United States Coast Guard (USCG) and United States Department of Transportation (DOT) to set S/A aside to enable civilian use of GNSS, but remained steadfast in its objection on grounds of security.\n\nThrough the early to mid 1980s, a number of agencies developed a solution to the SA \"problem\". Since the SA signal was changed slowly, the effect of its offset on positioning was relatively fixed – that is, if the offset was \"100 meters to the east\", that offset would be true over a relatively wide area. This suggested that broadcasting this offset to local GPS receivers could eliminate the effects of SA, resulting in measurements closer to GPS's theoretical performance, around 15 meters. Additionally, another major source of errors in a GPS fix is due to transmission delays in the ionosphere, which could also be measured and corrected for in the broadcast. This offered an improvement to about 5 meters accuracy, more than enough for most civilian needs.\n\nThe US Coast Guard was one of the more aggressive proponents of the DGPS, experimenting with the system on an ever-wider basis through the late 1980s and early 1990s. These signals are broadcast on marine longwave frequencies, which could be received on existing radiotelephones and fed into suitably equipped GPS receivers. Almost all major GPS vendors offered units with DGPS inputs, not only for the USCG signals, but also aviation units on either VHF or commercial AM radio bands.\n\nThey started sending out \"production quality\" DGPS signals on a limited basis in 1996, and rapidly expanded the network to cover most US ports of call, as well as the Saint Lawrence Seaway in partnership with the Canadian Coast Guard. Plans were put into place to expand the system across the US, but this would not be easy. The quality of the DGPS corrections generally fell with distance, and large transmitters capable of covering large areas tend to cluster near cities. This meant that lower-population areas, notably in the midwest and Alaska, would have little coverage by ground-based GPS. As of November 2013 the USCG's national DGPS consisted of 85 broadcast sites which provide dual coverage to almost the entire US coastline and inland navigable waterways including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. In addition the system provided single or dual coverage to a majority of the inland portion of United States. Instead, the FAA (and others) started studying broadcasting the signals across the entire hemisphere from communications satellites in geostationary orbit. This led to the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) and similar systems, although these are generally not referred to as DGPS, or alternatively, \"wide-area DGPS\". WAAS offers accuracy similar to the USCG's ground-based DGPS networks, and there has been some argument that the latter will be turned off as WAAS becomes fully operational.\n\nBy the mid-1990s it was clear that the SA system was no longer useful in its intended role. DGPS would render it ineffective over the US, where it was considered most needed. Additionally, during the Gulf War of 1990-1991 SA had been temporarily turned off because Allied troops were using commercial GPS receivers. This showed that leaving SA turned off could be useful to the United States. In 2000, an executive order by President Bill Clinton turned it off permanently in 2000.\n\nNevertheless, by this point DGPS had evolved into a system for providing more accuracy than even a non-SA GPS signal could provide on its own. There are several other sources of error which share the same characteristics as SA in that they are the same over large areas and for \"reasonable\" amounts of time. These include the ionospheric effects mentioned earlier, as well as errors in the satellite position ephemeris data and clock drift on the satellites. Depending on the amount of data being sent in the DGPS correction signal, correcting for these effects can reduce the error significantly, the best implementations offering accuracies of under 10 cm.\n\nIn addition to continued deployments of the USCG and FAA sponsored systems, a number of vendors have created commercial DGPS services, selling their signal (or receivers for it) to users who require better accuracy than the nominal 15 meters GPS offers. Almost all commercial GPS units, even hand-held units, now offer DGPS data inputs, and many also support WAAS directly. To some degree, a form of DGPS is now a natural part of most GPS operations.\n\nA reference station calculates differential corrections for its own location and time. Users may be up to 200 nautical miles (370 km) from the station, however, and some of the compensated errors vary with space: specifically, satellite ephemeris errors and those introduced by ionospheric and tropospheric distortions. For this reason, the accuracy of DGPS decreases with distance from the reference station. The problem can be aggravated if the user and the station lack \"inter visibility\"—when they are unable to see the same satellites.\n\nThe United States \"Federal Radionavigation Plan\" and the IALA \"Recommendation on the Performance and Monitoring of DGNSS Services in the Band 283.5–325 kHz\" cite the United States Department of Transportation's 1993 estimated error growth of 0.67 m per 100 km from the broadcast site but measurements of accuracy across the Atlantic, in Portugal, suggest a degradation of just 0.22 m per 100 km.\n\nDGPS can refer to any type of Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS). There are many operational systems in use throughout the world, according to the US Coast Guard, 47 countries operate systems similar to the US NDGPS (Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System).\n\nA list can be found at World DGPS Database for Dxers\n\nEuropean DGPS network has been developed mainly by the Finnish and Swedish maritime administrations in order to improve safety in the archipelago between the two countries.\n\nIn the UK and Ireland, the system was implemented as a maritime navigation aid to fill the gap left by the demise of the Decca Navigator System in 2000. With a network of 12 transmitters sited around the coastline and three control stations, it was set up in 1998 by the countries' respective General Lighthouse Authorities (GLA) — Trinity House covering England, Wales and the Channel Islands, the Northern Lighthouse Board covering Scotland and the Isle of Man and the Commissioners of Irish Lights, covering the whole of Ireland. Transmitting on the 300-kHz band, the system underwent testing and two additional transmitters were added before the system was declared operational in 2002.\n\nTrinity House - DGNSS Stations: UK and Ireland\n\nEffective Solutions (Data Products) - European Differential Beacon Transmitters - Details and map\n\nThe United States Department of Transportation, in conjunction with the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration and the National Geodetic Survey appointed the Coast Guard as the maintaining agency for the U.S. Nationwide DGPS network (NDGPS). The system is an expansion of the previous Maritime Differential GPS (MDGPS), which the Coast Guard began in the late 1980s and completed in March 1999. MDGPS covered only coastal waters, the Great Lakes, and the Mississippi River inland waterways, while NDGPS expands this to include complete coverage of the continental United States. The centralized Command and Control unit is the USCG Navigation Center, based in Alexandria, VA. There are currently 85 NDGPS sites in the US network, administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Navigation Center.\n\nIn 2015, the USCG and USACE sought comments on a planned phasing-out of the U.S. DGPS. In response to the comments received, a subsequent 2016 Federal Register notice announced that 46 stations would remain in service and \"available to users in the maritime and coastal regions\". In spite of this decision, USACE decommissioned its remaining 7 sites and, in March 2018, the USCG announced that it would decommission its remaining stations by 2020.\n\nThe Canadian system is similar to the US system and is primarily for maritime usage covering the Atlantic and Pacific coast as well as the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway.\nAustralia runs three DGPSes: one is mainly for marine navigation, broadcasting its signal on the long-wave band; another is used for land surveys and land navigation, and has corrections broadcast on the Commercial FM radio band. The third at Sydney airport is currently undergoing testing for precision landing of aircraft (2011), as a backup to the Instrument Landing System at least until 2015. It is called the Ground Based Augmentation System. Corrections to aircraft position are broadcast via the aviation VHF band.\n\nPost-processing is used in Differential GPS to obtain precise positions of unknown points by relating them to known points such as survey markers.\n\nThe GPS measurements are usually stored in computer memory in the GPS receivers, and are subsequently transferred to a computer running the GPS post-processing software. The software computes baselines using simultaneous measurement data from two or more GPS receivers.\n\nThe baselines represent a three-dimensional line drawn between the two points occupied by each pair of GPS antennas. The post-processed measurements allow more precise positioning, because most GPS errors affect each receiver nearly equally, and therefore can be cancelled out in the calculations.\n\nDifferential GPS measurements can also be computed in real time by some GPS receivers if they receive a correction signal using a separate radio receiver, for example in Real Time Kinematic (RTK) surveying or navigation.\n\nThe improvement of GPS positioning doesn't require simultaneous measurements of two or more receivers in any case, but can also be done by special use of a \"single\" device. In the 1990s when even handheld receivers were quite expensive, some methods of quasi-differential GPS were developed, using the receiver by quick turns of positions or loops of 3-10 survey points.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1905410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905410", "title": "Graham Farmer Freeway", "text": "Graham Farmer Freeway\n\nGraham Farmer Freeway is a inner-city freeway in Perth, Western Australia. It links Rivervale and Burswood with West Perth and Leederville, providing an east-west bypass of Perth's central business district.\n\nThe freeway, in conjunction with Great Eastern Highway and Orrong Road, is also an important connection between the city centre and Perth Airport. It is allocated State Route 8, and was named in honour of the Australian rules footballer, Graham \"Polly\" Farmer, who played between 1953 and 1971 in both the West Australian and Victorian Football Leagues.\n\nThe freeway's western terminus is a hybrid interchange, combining a Full Y interchange with the Mitchell Freeway, an exit to James Street, and an entrance ramp from and exit ramp to Loftus Street. The interchange also incorporates a partial Y interchange that connects Charles Street to the Mitchell Freeway.\n\nImmediately east of the interchange is the Northbridge Tunnel, Western Australia's only freeway tunnel. The tunnel has three traffic lanes in each direction, with an escape passageway between the carriageways. The tunnel is colloquially known as the \"Polly Pipe\", a reference not only to the freeway's namesake, but also to the colloquialism \"Poly Pipe\" in reference to plastic pipes (commonly made from polyethylene or polyvinyl chloride materials) used in reticulation and plumbing. Both tunnel portals feature public art installations. At the western end, there is a pictorial history of Northbridge, and at the eastern end, the Aboriginal artist Ron Corbett created images based on indigenous artwork. The transportation of dangerous goods and explosives through the freeway tunnel is prohibited.\n\nAt the eastern end of the tunnel is the diamond interchange with East Parade, which connects the freeway to East Perth. The East Parade exit ramps allow traffic movements to the opposite entrance ramp, as the westbound entrance ramp also connects to Lord Street, whilst the eastbound exit ramp merges with a ramp from Lord Street. This allows a connection between the city centre and the freeway, via Lord Street.\n\nThe freeway then crosses the Swan River over the , six lane Windan Bridge. The bridge is one of the more recent constructions of the 19 bridges that cross the river. It includes pedestrian and cycling access.\n\nGraham Farmer Freeway continues into Burswood as a six lane freeway. There is a diamond interchange with Victoria Park Drive for access to the adjacent Belmont Park Racecourse, and the nearby Crown Perth complex. The eastern terminus is a modified diamond interchange with Great Eastern Highway, that includes a looped ramp for the south-westbound to north-eastbound traffic movement. The freeway continues south-east as Orrong Road, an arterial road that is also part of State Route 8.\n\nGraham Farmer Freeway was constructed between 1996 and 2000, and used over 180,000 cubic metres of concrete. The project finished three months early and within budget, costing $313 million. It has been designed to have a 150-year lifespan, following the Main Roads Western Australia specification.\n\nStage 1 involved construction of the tunnel and was undertaken by a Clough/Baulderstone Hornibrook joint venture, was a finalist for the 2001 Australian Construction Achievement Award.\n\nStage 2 included the Windan Bridge, and nine other traffic and pedestrian bridge structures. This stage won an award from Austroads, the Association of Australian and New Zealand Road Transport and Traffic Authorities.\n\nDuring several weekend closures in April 2013, the existing breakdown shoulders were removed to accommodate an extra lane of traffic in each direction, without modifying the tunnel's structure. The removal of the breakdown lanes was criticised by the state Opposition, and the RAC raised concerns about emergency response times. As part of the upgrade, Main Roads Western Australia implemented an incident response plan, including a dedicated towing service, and the fire control and ventilation systems were upgraded. The new eastbound lane opened on 16 April, a day after it was originally scheduled to open, due to delays in commissioning the new lane use management system. The third westbound lane opened on 29 April, as scheduled. The works were designed to improve the traffic flow in the Perth CBD, which was affected by construction projects such as the development of Elizabeth Quay.\n\n"}
{"id": "1905417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905417", "title": "Loony left", "text": "Loony left\n\nThe loony left is a pejorative term to describe those considered to be politically far left. The term was widely used in the campaign for the 1987 general election and subsequently both by the Conservative Party and by British newspapers that supported the Conservatives as well as by more moderate factions within the Labour movement to refer to the activities of more militantly left-wing politicians that they believed moderate voters would perceive as extreme or unreasonable. The label was directed at the policies and actions of some Labour controlled inner-city councils and some Labour Party politicians. Although the labels \"hard left\" and \"soft left\" reflected a genuine political division within the Labour Party, \"loony left\" was by far the more often used label than either. While academics have depicted the era as of the \"new urban left\" (such as the rate-capping rebellion) as a throwback to earlier municipal militancy (e.g. Poplarism), wider media coverage tended to focus on the personalities of city leaders such as the Greater London Council's Ken Livingstone and Liverpool's Derek Hatton.\n\nThe term \"Loony Left\" as used to describe certain aspects of Labour politics was invented by the British popular press a few years before the 1987 general election. Throughout the run-up to the election it became a staple feature of press-coverage of the election, with many stories running detailing the \"antics\" of Labour politicians and Labour-controlled local government authorities.\n\nJolyon Jenkins recorded in 1987 that 1986 was the climax of the Loony Left campaign:\nThe ridicule of the political left by some British newspapers has a far longer history. Petley observes that the British press had long-since \"perfected a way of representing the ideas and personalities associated with socialism as so deranged and psychotic that they represented a danger to society\", thus rendering them fair game for editorial vilification. After his party's defeat in the 1983 general election, one newspaper had characterised Michael Foot's habit of swinging his walking stick around as he went for his morning walk as being \"like an escaped loony\". The election of Ken Livingstone to leader of the Greater London Council in 1981 had him regularly described in newspapers as \"barmy\" or \"loony\", with the GLC's policies labelled \"crazy\". These labels were increasingly also applied to local councils within London: The 13 March 1983 \"Sunday People\" labelled Islington local council the \"Bananas republic\"; and the 13 February 1983 \"Mail on Sunday\" labelled it \"The mad mad mad mad world of Islington\". In some ways, the \"Loony Left\" campaign was a generalisation of the Conservative campaign of demonising Livingstone and the GLC.\n\nAs recorded by Jenkins, the climax of the campaign was in 1986 and pivotal moments in its history were the London local council elections held in May 1986 and the 1987 Greenwich by-election as well as of course the campaign for the 1987 general election.\n\nThe general theme that the \"Loony Left\" label suggested was twofold and Labour Party local government authorities were perceived to be:\n\n\"Loony Left\" was also used to describe specific individuals. Neil Kinnock, who had been subject to press vituperation since his election as party leader was associated with the \"Loony Left\" when in March 1987 he endorsed a rise of 60% in local council rates in Ealing, where he was a rate-payer. The \"Sun\" gave this the headline \"Kinnock admits — I back loonies\" and other newspapers put this forward as an example of support for extremism by the Labour Party leadership. A later story in the \"Daily Express\" about how Ken Livingstone purportedly had a left-wing takeover of the party arranged was denied by the Labour leadership only to have that reported as \"Neil Denies Truth About Left Plot\".\n\nSimilarly, Deirdrie Wood, Labour candidate in the 1987 Greenwich by-election, came to be known in the press as \"Dreadful Deirdrie\". Wood had been selected by her local constituency party against opposition from the Labour leadership. Privately, she had promised Kinnock \"I won't drop you in it\", to which he had replied \"It's not you, it's those bastards out there\", i.e. the press. Labour presented her as \"a hard-working local woman with sensible policies\", but the press portrayed her as a radical extremist both by association, as an IRA sympathiser living with a militant shop steward who was not the father of her children and directly as a \"hard left feminist, anti-racist and gay-rights supporter\" (as one \"News of the World\" report put it) who wanted to twin London schools with PLO camps.\n\nHowever, local authorities were the primary targets, in part because that is where progressives had found their platform in the 1980s. This was caused by two factors: a change in the composition of local authorities and the general election defeats for Labour from 1979 onwards. Partly because of structural changes to local authorities enacted in 1974, including the end of local aldermanic dignities and partly simply as a result of an influx of new people whose background had been in the radical youth movements of the 1960s, local government authorities became highly partisan political battlegrounds in the 1970s and 1980s that a canny politician would be able to use to construct a power base and as a stepping stone to a career in national-level politics.\n\nThis was compounded by the general election defeats for Labour, leaving the party with little ability to push its agenda at a national level in Westminster. As a result, local authorities became hotbeds of progressive and radical ideas and a conflict between local Labour local authorities and the Conservative central government on many issues ensued. Like municipal socialism before it, Labour leaderships at local level saw themselves as stronger than their Westminster party colleagues and capable of pushing socialist political agendas where they could not be pushed at national level. This resulted in an era of \"grand gesture politics\", with local authorities taking highly visible stances on national political issues such as declaring themselves nuclear-free zones and \"rainbow coalitions\" between local Labour party politicians and pressure groups for causes outside of Labour's traditional working-class roots, such as anti-racism, gay rights, disabled rights and feminist groups.\n\nUnfortunately for Labour, the wide range of local-level policy initiatives that this engendered made it easy for Conservative opponents to then apply the \"Loony Left\" blanket label that the news media had handed to them, a political card that the Conservatives played at both local and national levels. The label was a particularly effective tactic against Labour-controlled local education authorities because the suggestion of innocent children being manipulated to further cynical adult political goals was a very potent image.\n\nThe label still occurs in British political discourse, even in the 21st century and has become a firmly embedded feature of British journalism. However, changes made by the Labour Party after the 1987 general election to ensure that it was no longer associated in the public mind with the images of the \"Loony Left\" from 1986–1987 have since blunted its impact and reduced its power, to the extent that it had far less impact on the 1992 United Kingdom general election, less even (according to academic studies by Butler and Kavanaugh) than Labour Party officials themselves believed at the time post-election.\n\nThese changes were in part an increased awareness of how important news media were to Labour's election campaign. One party press secretary said of Labour's attitude to the news media in the 1983 general election campaign: \"If a miracle had happened and Fleet Street had suddenly come clamouring to Walworth Road for pro-Labour material, they would have been sent away with a copy of the manifesto each\". The party leadership noted afterwards that it had been the effect of the \"Loony Left\" image that had caused it to lose the 1987 Greenwich by-election by such a large margin. This is not to say that Labour ignored the press, but it became reluctant to talk to it. Kinnock refused to talk to the press on the flight back from his visit to the U.S. President Ronald Reagan after British journalists had continually sought a story that would represent the trip in a negative light. Similarly, Patricia Hewitt, then party press secretary, considered abandoning holding daily press conferences in the run-up to the 1987 general election because \"they allow the newspaper journalists to set the agenda … and we know where they stand\".\n\nIn a widely leaked letter written to Frank Dobson after the Greenwich by-election and published by the \"Sun\" under the headline \"Gays put Kinnock in a panic — secret letter lashes loonies\", Hewitt said:\nNick Raynsford similarly ascribed the general election defeat to the \"Loony Left\" and other factors stating after the election that there were \"too many worrying skeletons in the Labour Party cupboard deterring voters\". In general, the \"soft left\" portion of the Labour Party blamed the \"Loony Left\" perception for this third general election defeat, despite the election campaign having been, in Larry Whitty's words, \"the most effective campaign the party has ever waged\". According to the \"soft left\", the Labour-controlled local government authorities had made errors in both pace and presentation, albeit that almost any initiative relating to race or sex, no matter how presented or paced, would have been seized by the press and held up for vilification.\n\nEven before the election, Labour was working hard to distance itself from the \"Loony Left\" perception. Roy Hattersley stated that at the time of the initiative of Brent Council to appoint race-relations advisers to schools \"I do not deny the existence of unacceptable behaviour in some local education authorities. I want to eliminate it\". Similarly, a question-and-answer pamphlet for voters prepared by staff at Labour headquarters had the question: \"But if I vote Labour won't I get a loony left council like those in London?\", to which the answer given was: \"Left councils are exceptions, Neil Kinnock has told them to mend their ways and he is in full charge of the Labour Party\".\n\nOn several occasions, the Labour Party leadership and others attempted to take a hard line on the \"Loony Left\" in order to gain a more favourable impression in the media. On 3 April 1987, for example, five Labour MPs with constituencies in Birmingham — Roy Hattersley, Denis Howell, Jeff Rooker, Terry Davis and Robin Corbett — wrote to Sharon Atkin, Bernie Grant and Linda Bellos in letters that they themselves leaked to the newspapers, demanding that they not attend a meeting in Birmingham, scheduled for 7 April, of activists campaigning for Black Sections within the Labour Party. Similarly, after the Greenwich by-election defeat five London Labour Party members — Brian Nicholson, Roger Godsiff, John Spellar, Roy Shaw and Dianne Hayter — formed the \"Londoners for Labour\" association, according to their press releases aimed at reclaiming the London Labour Party from \"the loonies\".\n\nThe 1980s UK press campaign against the \"Loony Left\" was echoed in the 1990s in the U.S. where sections of the press campaigned against political correctness, using much the same rhetoric. The same accusations made by the British press in the 1980s were levelled by U.S. newspapers such as \"The Chicago Tribune\", \"The New Republic\", \"Time\", \"Newsweek\" and \"New York\".\n\nAs Jenkins noted, the truth of the stories mattered less than their resonance with voter fears. Three of the most famously recorded instances of \"Loony Left\" activities - the renaming of the nursery rhyme Baa Baa Black Sheep, of \"manhole covers\" and of \"black bin-liner bags\" - were myths, outright fabrications by the press. Others stories, such as reports that London councils had insisted that homosexuals be placed at the heads of the waiting lists for council housing and that London councils had spent £500,000 on \"24 super-loos for gypsies\" were found to be highly misleading upon investigation by the Media Research Group of Goldsmiths' College, University of London.\n\nThe report of the MRG investigation estimated that some 3,000 news stories about the \"Loony Left\" ran between 1981 and 1987 in the British tabloid press alone. It determined that a large proportion of these stories were either partially or wholly fabricated and that their targets, against whom they aimed to inflame public opinion, were a small number of London local councils that were under Labour Party control.\n\nIn 1986, a parent-run nursery school banned the song \"Baa Baa Black Sheep\" over concerns the song might have racial undertones. Over time, media reports came to misreport the story, eventually incorrectly claiming the Birmingham City Council had ordered the lyrics be changed to \"Baa Baa green sheep\".\n\nVariants of this story have been reported repeatedly by the British mass media since 1986, to the state at which it has almost gained the status as an urban myth. Both \"The Age\" and \"The Herald\" reported in 2002, for example, the same \"Baa Baa White Sheep\" story, ascribing it to a parent of a child attending Paston Ridings Primary School in London.\n\nThe original story reported a ban at Beevers Nursery, a privately run nursery school in Hackney. It was originally reported by Bill Akass, then a journalist at the \"Daily Star\" in the 15 February 1986 edition under the headline \"Now it's Baa Baa Blank Sheep\". Akass had heard of a ban issued, by nursery school staff, on the singing of the nursery rhyme \"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep\" on the grounds that it was racist. In his story, he wrote:\n\nThe nursery was run by the parents, rather than by Hackney council, but Akass had telephoned Hackney council for its reaction to his story. Martin Bostock, then the press officer for Hackney council, reported that he had considered the possibility of simply responding: \"We don't know what this nursery is doing, but whatever they're doing it is up to them\". However, according to Bostock council leader Tony Millwood, Bostock rejected this advice and wanted to take a more supportive stance on the alleged ban and in conjunction with the press office drafted and issued a statement saying \"that we supported what they'd done, although making it quite clear that it was not a council nursery and not a council ban\".\n\nThree days later in the 18 February 1986 \"Hackney Gazette\", Tim Cooper took up Akass's story. He went to Beevers Nursery and asked parents there what their reactions were in turn to the Hackney council statement itself a reaction to the claim that Beevers had issued a ban. Cooper's story reported one of the nursery playleaders as saying: \"We're run by parents and if they want us to stop singing it, we would. But there have been no complaints so far, though someone once suggested it could be racist\". Cooper later stated that there had been no such ban, but that the statement issued by Millwood and Hackney council had given the story the impetus that it was then to run with:\n\nIn fact, the playgroup leaders had requested the racialism awareness course, at which attendance was not compulsory, there had been no ban imposed by Haringey council and there was no evidence that the rhyme had even been discussed on the course. As before, only newspapers for the British black community reported these facts. The attempts by the \"Daily Mail\" attempts to fact check the story that it had run, including posing as parents looking for playgroups and as supermarket managers wanting to run racialism awareness courses, had failed to elicit a single playgroup worker who would confirm the alleged council ban.\n\nHaringey council initiated legal action against the \"Daily Mail\", but was forced to drop it for lack of funds.\n\nThe \"Daily Mail\" ran the story again on 20 October, comparing Haringey council to Nazi Germany. Again, the council attempted to set the record straight with a press statement that noted the irony of the \"Daily Mail\" comparing the council to Nazi Germany when the \"Mail\" itself had supported Hitler right up until the eve of World War II. Again, only the British black community newspapers (the 3 November \"Asian Herald\" and the 5 November \"West Indian News\") carried Haringey council's corrections. The story continued to be carried by many newspapers for months thereafter, including \"The Economist\" on 1 November and the \"Islington Gazette\" on 20 February 1987, this time with Islington council as the ban-issuer, a fact that was explicitly denied by a council spokesman in the piece, who said that \"it is not council policy to ban Baa Baa Black Sheep but if individual nursery workers find it offensive the council is not in the business of forcing them to teach that rhyme rather than others\".\n\nEven other political parties ran with the story. A party election broadcast for the Social Democratic Party, fronted by John Cleese, named Islington council as \"the council that accused a five year old of reciting a racially offensive poem\". Islington council sought an injunction in the High Court to have this material excluded, but this was denied by Mr Justice Drake. David Owen dropped the material anyway, stating that it was to avoid further distress to the five-year-old's family. Ironically, the press reported Owen's press conference, announcing this change as \"loony\" David Owen \"outclowning anything that Basil Fawlty could have thought up\".\n\nIn 2000, the BBC reported the withdrawal of guidance to nursery schools by Birmingham City Council that the nursery rhyme \"Baa Baa Black Sheep\" should not be taught.\n\nPeter Jenkins, a columnist for \"The Guardian\" and \"The Independent\", recorded policies which were dubbed \"loony left\" by the media. For instance, Haringey council allowed only Nicaraguan coffee to be sold and introduced courses on homosexuality into its nursery and primary schools.\n\nHackney London Borough Council ended its twinning arrangements with France, West Germany and Israel and made new twinnings with the Soviet Union, East Germany and Nicaragua. A spokesperson for the council explained: \"This will enable us to concentrate on our new friends\". When Sinn Féin representatives were invited to speak to Hackney council, a revolver was fired by a Liberal and there was a fight in the council chamber.\n\nLambeth London Borough Council banned the word \"family\" from council literature because this was \"discriminatory\" and police were banned from using council facilities. Lambeth council's leader, Linda Bellos, claimed: \"I think the police are bent on war\".\n\nEaling council removed all books it considered to be \"racist\" and \"sexist\" from its local libraries. An Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) teaching pack titled \"Auschwitz: Yesterday's Racism\" drew comparisons between the trade union legislation of Adolf Hitler and Margaret Thatcher. Another ILEA school in Kennington discouraged competitive games and making pupils write protest letters was made part of the school time-table.\n\n\n"}

As of 2016, it is the 13th busiest civil airport in China. Located about from downtown Changsha in the town of Huanghua in Changsha County, the airport has two terminal buildings. The airport is managed by the Hunan Airport Authority, a publicly owned corporation managing all five airports in Hunan Province. Huanghua airport was opened in August 1989, replacing Changsha Datuopu Airport, which is now a military air base.\n\nTerminal 1, with 32,000 m2 of space, has 3 concourses (T1-A, T1-B and T1-c). It was opened in 2000, and the proposed capacity was 4.6 million passengers annually. Terminal 1 was closed for renovation from July 2011 to 17 May 2018 after Terminal 2 became fully operational.\n\nTerminal 1 reopened on 18 May 2018. After renovation, Terminal 1 has 39,000 m2 of space, 38 check-in counters, 10 security lanes and 10 aerobridges. It has the capacity of 6 million passengers annually. Terminal 1 serves Air China, Chengdu Airlines, Joy Air, Okay Airways, Tibet Airlines, Shandong Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines and Kunming Airlines.\n\nThe inauguration of Terminal 2 was on July 19, 2011. With 212,000 square meters of space, the new terminal is the 5th largest airport terminal in mainland China (after Beijing–Capital, Shanghai–Pudong, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen). The 39.9m tall main building of Terminal 2, being 672m in length and 168m in depth, is the largest single steel-truss structure in Hunan. The new terminal has 22 bridge gates, to which the longest passenger walking distance is within 300m. With this new facility, the airport can handle 151,000 aircraft movements and another 15.6 million passengers every year. The peak hour volume of passengers is 3,940.\n\nThe Departure Hall has 4 automatic double-glass-door entrances which are directly facing Check-in Areas A,B,C & D respectively. Entrances 1-3 are domestic entrances and Entrance 4 is for International, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan Departures, which will be checked in at Area D. Area A is the exclusive check-in Area for China Southern Airlines. Area B&C are domestic check-in areas for other airlines. The terminal has 80 check-in counters and 24 self-checkin kiosks, 24 security checkpoints and more than 6,390 seats.\n\nThe Arrival Hall is equipped with 8 baggage carousels (6 at domestic area and 2 at international area). The indoor parking garage P4, which has 693 parking spaces, is on floor B2. There are also three outdoor parking areas, P1,2&3, which provide over 1000 parking spaces.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1989, Datuopu Airport served as a dual-use military and civil airport for Changsha. It was only capable of handling small aircraft and a few flights per day. The Hunan Provincial Government proposed the construction of a new airport in October 1984, which was approved by the State Council of China. Construction for Huanghua Airport began in June 1986, and it was opened on 29 August 1989, when all civil flights were transferred to the new airport, and Datuopu reverted to sole military use.\n\nOn October 28, 2000, the 34,000-square-meter Terminal 1-A, which cost 40.4 million CNY, was opened. The airport was capable of handling 4.6 million passengers per year. Afterwards, the construction of Terminal 1-B and Terminal 1-C were finished to ensure growing passengers and cargo.\n\nThe airport then went through a major expansion in 2008–2011, with lengthening of runway 18/36 from 2600m to 3200m and the addition of Terminal 2 which went into operation in 2011. The airport welcomed its first intercontinental destination when China Southern Airlines began service to Frankfurt, Germany on 23 June 2014.\n\nThe construction of the second runway was completed in November, 2016. The new 3800mx60m Code-4F runway was built parallel to the current 18/36 runway and lies 380m to the east. The second runway officially came into use on March 30, 2017. The new runway means that Huanghua Airport is now ranked as a 4F, the highest level for an airport, and capable of accommodating wide-body aircraft such as the A380.\n\nOn May 16, 2018, the renovated Terminal 1 of the Changsha Huanghua International Airport resumes operation. The domestic flights operated by Air China, Shenzhen Airlines, Shandong Airlines, Chengdu Airlines, Kunming Airlines, Okay Airways, Joy Air, and Tibet Airlines arrive at T1. \n\nThe airport is undergoing a major expansion eastwards. After the completion of the 2nd runway, Terminal 3 and the east terminal area will be constructed on the east side of airport, with 500,000 square meters of space. The airport will be capable of handling 60 million passengers annually and an annual cargo capacity of 6 million tons. The airport becomes a hub in Central China after this stage. A third runway of 3600m*45m in length and a GTC with 280,000 square meters of space will also be constructed and ready for use in 2024.\n\nTerminal 4 is to be constructed on the north side of the East terminal area. The east terminal area, in which both Terminals 3&4 lie, is located between the 2nd and 3rd Runways. At the final stage, the fourth parallel runway (3600m) of 4E will be constructed 1035m in the east of the third runway. Two tunnels connecting the west area (Terminal 1&2) and the east terminals (Terminal 3&4) are considered.\n\nChangsha Huanghua Int'l airport will become a major hub in China which hosts a number of based airlines. The ultimate capacity of the airport will be 90 million passengers annually.\n\nAs for 2016, Changsha Huanghua International Airport was the 13th busiest airport in the People's Republic of China with 21,296,700 passengers.\n\n<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

On August 9, 2014, in an email to email account holders, CES announced that \"[a]s of September 30, 2014 (Tuesday) 6pm ET, the current SpamCop Email service will be converted to email forwarding-only with spam filtered by SpamCop for all existing SpamCop Email users\" and that \"SpamCop will no longer provide IMAP or POP service [after that date].\"\n\nSpamCop is effective at helping ISPs, web hosts and email providers identify accounts that are being abused and shut them down before the spammer finishes operations. SpamCop provides information from its reports to third parties who are also working to fight spam, amplifying the impact of its services beyond its own reach.\n\nFor first-time SpamCop Reporters, the SpamCop Parsing and Reporting Service requires that the reporter manually verify that each submission is spam and that the destinations of the spam reports are correct. People who use tools to automatically report spam, who report email that is not spam, or report to the wrong people may be fined or banned. This verification requires extra time and effort. Despite these steps, reports to innocent bystanders do happen and ISPs may need to configure SpamCop to not send further reports if they do not want to see them again.\n\n\n"}

He selected the season of Lent for his attacks, when the defenders were weakened by their fasts. He was eventually slain in battle during his final offensive, targeting the Amhara, Shewa, and Fatagar provinces south of the Awash River.\n\nSources differ over the number of years Mahfuz raided Abyssinia. Francisco Álvares states that his raids began during the reign of Eskender, and lasted 25 years. However, Beckingham and Huntingford note that the Ethiopian \"Paris Chronicle\", which draws on contemporary Ethiopian records, dates the beginning of these raids to the ascension of Dawit II (Lebna Dengel) in 1508. Mahfuz reportedly caused the death of Ethiopian Emperors Na'od and Eskender.\n\nUpon reaching majority, Emperor Lebna Dengel decided to forgo his observance of Lent and oppose the Imam in battle, despite the advice and wishes of his councilors and people. He sent spies out to determine Imam Mahfuz's plans for that year, and learning the Imam was in Fatagar led his army there. He found Imam Mahfuz with the sultan of Adal encamped on a plain that was surrounded by mountains. After first sending soldiers out to secure the passes, the Abyssinian Emperor closed upon Imam Mahfuz.\n\nAlthough Imam Mahfuz managed to enable Sultan Muhammed to escape with but four horsemen, according to Alvarez, Imam Mafhuz knew he was trapped and sought to die with honor. He called to the Abyssinians a challenge to fight in single combat, and Gabra Endreyas, who had been a follower of Emperor Lebna Dengel's father, accepted and killed the Imam. Mahfuz's head was cut from his body and displayed publicly in the Emperor's court. After defeating Mahfuz, Dawit II used appellation \"Wanag Segad\", which is a combination of Ge'ez and Harari terms.\n\nMahfuz' daughter, Bati del Wambara, married Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi of the Adal Sultanate. Ten years after Mahfuz's death, Al-Ghazi embarked on a Conquest of Abyssinia (\"Futuh al-Habash\").\n\n"}
{"id": "1905435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905435", "title": "Ut pictura poesis", "text": "Ut pictura poesis\n\nUt pictura poesis is a Latin phrase literally meaning \"as is painting so is poetry\". The statement (often repeated) occurs most famously in Horace's \"Ars Poetica\", near the end, immediately after another famous quotation, \"\", or \"even Homer nods\" (an indication that even the most skilled poet can compose inferior verse):\nHorace meant that poetry (in its widest sense, \"imaginative texts\") merited the same careful interpretation that was, in Horace's day, reserved for painting.\n\nSome centuries before, Simonides of Keos (c. 556 – 468 BC) had stated, \",\" which translates into, \"Poetry is a speaking picture, painting a silent poetry.\" Yet, as this phrase has traversed history, it has ignited academic arguments over whether or not it is true. Plato, through his own thought process on credible knowledge, found painting and writing to be unreliable sources of understanding, disregarding the concept entirely. The lack of credibility rested on his opinion that both forms of art gave a false simulation of reality. Moving on from Plato's time to the Renaissance, the argument sprung up over which form was superior. It was decided, at this time, that painting took precedence because sight was higher-ranking to people than hearing was.\n\nGotthold Ephraim Lessing opens his \"Laocoön: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry\" (1766) by observing that \"the first who compared painting with poetry [Simonides of Ceos] was a man of fine feeling,\" though, Lessing makes it clear, not a critic or philosopher. Lessing argues that painting is a synchronic, visual phenomenon, one of space that is immediately in its entirety understood and appreciated, while poetry (again, in its widest sense) is a diachronic art of the ear, one that depends on time to unfold itself for the reader's appreciation. He recommends that poetry and painting should not be confused, and that they are best practiced and appreciated \"as two equitable and friendly neighbors.\"\n\nW. J. T. Mitchell trenchantly observed that \"We tend to think that to compare poetry with painting is to make a metaphor, while to differentiate poetry from painting is to state a literal truth.\"\n\nThe \"paragone\" was another long-running debate, typically rather more competitive, comparing painting and sculpture.\n\n18th-century British poet Alexander Pope was partial to \"ut pictura poesis.\" He considered both painting and poetry to be equals, and \"it can easily be seen that he held that there was a close relationship between the art of poetry and the art of painting, especially perhaps since such a relationship combined the two arts of which he was a practitioner.\" There is note of Pope finding himself \"in a larger context of a continuous line of poetic pictorialism\". \"Ut pictura poesis\" surfaces in regards to Pope's \"Rape of the Lock\" through his in-depth descriptions of the characters and plot. Rebecca Ferguson, in her essay \"'Quick as her Eyes, and as unfix'd as those': objectification and seeing in Pope's 'Rape of the Lock'\", draws attention to these details, specifically with Belinda’s character. Ferguson explains an aspect of how Pope was painting a character and a plot: \"Pope's construction of Belinda seems to render her just such a 'frontier' between a constructive and a destructive chaos, between qualities which are 'neither inside nor outside', neither invested in her 'essential' self nor in her body,\" and\n\nThe belle is identified in many ways with the display of vessels and treasures around her, both as a consumer and as a figure who takes on some of the properties of those riches, yet her attractions are in the end not so much displayed as set in motion; she 'rises in her charms', 'awakens' and 'calls forth' her wonders and graces, culminating in the dispersal of both her body and her allure in the reader's eye.\n\nThere is an emphasis on the reader's eye and the imagery that contributed to audience members being able to so vividly 'watch' the plot of this poem unfold.\n\n"}

{"id": "1905451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905451", "title": "Chokehold", "text": "Chokehold\n\nA chokehold, choke, stranglehold or, in Judo, shime-waza (; ) is a general term for a grappling hold that critically reduces or prevents either air (choking) or blood (strangling) from passing through the neck of an opponent. The restriction may be of one or both and depends on the hold used and the reaction of the victim.\n\nThe lack of blood or air often leads to unconsciousness or even death if the hold is maintained. Chokeholds are used in martial arts, combat sports, self-defense, law enforcement and in military hand to hand combat applications. They are considered superior to brute-force manual strangling, which generally requires a large disparity in physical strength to be effective. Rather than using the fingers or arms to attempt to crush the neck, chokeholds effectively use leverage such as figure-four holds or collar holds that use the clothes to assist in the constriction.\n\nThe terminology used varies; in most martial arts, the term \"chokehold\" or \"choke\" is used for all types of grappling holds that strangle. This can be misleading as most holds aim to strangle not choke with the exception of \"air chokes\" (choking means \"to have severe difficulty in breathing because of a constricted or obstructed throat or a lack of air\"). In Judo terminology, \"blood chokes\" are referred to as \"strangleholds\" or \"strangles\" while \"air chokes\" are called \"chokeholds\" or \"chokes\". In forensics, the terms \"strangle\" and \"stranglehold\" designate any type of neck compression, while in law-enforcement they are referred to as \"neck holds\".\n\nAn air choke (or tracheal choke) specifically refers to a \"true\" choke that compresses the upper airway (trachea, larynx or laryngopharynx), hence interfering with breathing and leading to asphyxia. Although less effective at inducing unconsciousness than its vascular counterpart, the air choke causes excruciating pain and air hunger, and in combat sports a fighter will usually submit to such a submission hold. Air chokes have been associated with fractures of the larynx or hyoid bone, and are considered less safe than blood chokes to practice.\n\nBlood chokes (or carotid restraints / sleeper holds) are a form of strangulation that compress one or both carotid arteries and/or the jugular veins without compressing the airway, hence causing cerebral ischemia and a temporary hypoxic condition in the brain. A well applied blood choke may lead to unconsciousness in 10–20 seconds. Injury or death is plausible if the arteries remain constricted for more than 20 seconds. Compared to strangulation with the hands, properly applied blood chokes require little physical strength.\n\nMost chokeholds featured in combat sports and martial arts are blood chokes, although some air chokes or combinations occur as well. Blood chokes, especially the rear naked choke, triangle chokes, or gi chokes, are commonly used as submission holds in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. In judo, chokeholds, known as shime-waza, are often subject to restrictions based on age or rank. Chokeholds are not allowed in sport sambo but are allowed in combat sambo. The chokeholds used in catch wrestling and shoot wrestling are the inspiration for the \"chokeholds\" in modern professional wrestling performances. Due to the effectiveness of chokeholds and their popularity in a wide variety of martial arts, they are most often used to force submissions in mixed martial art and submission grappling competitions.\n\nIn law enforcement the goal is to force an uncooperative subject to submit without causing death or permanent injury. In this situation it is vital to distinguish between air and blood chokes. A hold that simultaneously blocks both the left and right carotid arteries results in cerebral ischemia and loss of consciousness within seconds. If properly applied, the hold produces almost immediate cessation of resistance. However to avoid injury the hold cannot be maintained more than a few seconds. When pressure on the carotids is released, the flow of oxygenated blood resumes immediately and consciousness slowly returns. In contrast, if the airway rather than the carotid arteries is blocked, the subject cannot breathe, but his brain is still perfused with blood and he will remain conscious and may continue to struggle for a minute or more; he will lose consciousness only when the oxygen in the circulating blood is consumed and he collapses from hypoxia. Even if the hold is released at this point, the blood circulating through the brain contains no oxygen, and consequently the subject may not regain consciousness or resume spontaneous breathing. Possibly the most important element of training for the use of chokeholds in law enforcement is the understanding that the subject should always be able to breathe freely. In the illustration above the operator correctly uses his right arm to compress both sides of the subject's neck, assisted by the pressure of his left hand, while his elbow, sharply flexed and centered over the midline, places no pressure on the trachea.\n\nFollowing a series of choking deaths, the Los Angeles Police Department banned chokeholds in 1980, and was soon followed by police departments nationwide. Choking suspects was widely banned by American police departments by the early 1990s, when New York City strengthened the force of an earlier ban on chokeholds. (It is also forensically known as a \"carotid sleeper\".) This however is not uniformly applied in the case of the United States of America, as the recent death of George Floyd on the 26th of May 2020 has shown.\n\n\n\n\n"}

These changes, which were implemented at the 2010 general election, included the transfer back of Thorney and Eye from North East Cambridgeshire to Peterborough, the return of the Cambridge ward of Trumpington from South Cambridgeshire to the Cambridge constituency, and small transfers of rural wards from North West Cambridgeshire to Huntingdon, and from South East Cambridgeshire to South Cambridgeshire.\nThe Boundary Commission for England submitted their final proposals in respect of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies (the 2018 review) in September 2018.

{"id": "1905467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905467", "title": "Feel Good Hit of the Summer", "text": "Feel Good Hit of the Summer\n\n\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\" is a song by American rock band Queens of the Stone Age and written by band members Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri. It is the opening track of their second album, \"Rated R\", and the second single to be released from it. The song also accompanied the UK release of the album on a separate CD entitled \"Rated U\". Upon the album's release, \"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\" had particular attention drawn to it due to the song's focus on drugs. Despite this, critical reception to the song was generally positive, with various critics considering it a highlight of the album.\n\nJosh Homme claimed the song was conceived after his three-day Millennium party. The song's lyrics are merely a list of drugs repeated throughout. The drugs listed in the verses are nicotine, Valium, Vicodin, marijuana, ecstasy and alcohol, with cocaine mentioned throughout the chorus. Homme has hinted that the song is a direct reference to the band's stoner rock label:\n[\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\"] might be like a knife in the neck of stoner rock. It's hard to tell, and I think that's the good part about it. Look, you're always going to get labeled with something. Stoner rock is kind of a dumbing-down label, and that's why I don't gravitate toward it.\n\nOn multiple occasions, Homme has also referred to the song as a \"social experiment\" in regards to how the public would approach it. He has also stated that despite the heavy drugs content in the track, the band's stance was left ambiguous, stating that \"there's no endorsement\" and that \"[the song] doesn't say yes or no\". Chris Goss, who co-produced \"Rated R\" with Homme under the pseudonym The 5:15ers, later stated that the track was intended to be a \"joke\" and a \"funny song\". He also commented that it was originally recorded as a chant at the end of the album, but its effectiveness resulted in its expansion into a full song and usage as the opener.\n\nThough it was Josh Homme who provided lead vocals, there are several other vocalists present on the track. Judas Priest lead singer Rob Halford was in a neighbouring studio when this song was first recorded and ended up singing backing vocals at the band's request, calling the lyrics a \"rock and roll cocktail\". Halford's performance was only used in the final chorus of the track, though this was enough to have him credited alongside Nick Oliveri, Wendy Ray Moan and Nick Eldorado as providing backing vocals. The song features again on \"Rated R\" as a reprise after the eighth track \"In the Fade\".\n\nDue to the frequency and blatant nature of the drug references in \"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\", a number of radio stations refused to play it. Wal-Mart initially refused to sell \"Rated R\" unless the song was removed from the album or a warning label placed upon it, though the band successfully argued that the cover and name of the album were warnings in themselves.\n\nCritically, the song fared well and was chosen as a highlight of \"Rated R\" by \"The Guardian\", Robert Christgau, and numerous others. In reference to the song, \"NME\" said in their review of the album that \"Among modern American rock moments, it stands alongside \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" or RATM's \"Killing in the Name\", such is its irresistible, instant impact\", also labelling it an \"anthem\". \"Rolling Stone\" similarly likened the track to \"unreleased Nirvana\". Steve Huey of Allmusic wasn't so taken with the song, branding it \"tiresome\" and chastising its usage for a reprisal.\n\n\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\" was featured in a number of prominent end-of-year lists for best song, including Robert Christgau's Pazz & Jop critics poll which placed the song at number 26. It also reached number six on NME's list, two places below fellow \"Rated R\" single \"The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret\". The song was also included on the CD release of the Triple J Hottest 100 for 2000, despite not featuring on the actual list. In October 2011, \"NME\" placed it at number 82 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".\n\nThe band reprise the track on their follow-up to \" Rated R\", \"Songs for the Deaf\", following the song \"A Song for the Deaf\". Though the music sounds similar, the lyrics are replaced by rhythmic laughing (it was entitled \"Feel Good Hit of Haha\"). Queens of the Stone Age have frequently performed \"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\" live since the release of \"Rated R\" and whilst touring subsequent albums. On the band's tour for their 2007 album \"Era Vulgaris\", the song was extended with numerous jams and new segments frequently taking it past the six-minute mark. It was on this tour that the band used the track as the opener for what was intended to be a six-song gig at an undisclosed Los Angeles rehab clinic. Due to the song's lyrics, the set was cut short and the band were escorted from the premises by security. \"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\" is used in videos by the Colorado Police Department to demonstrate the dangers of drunk driving, one of two Queens of the Stone Age tracks to be used in such a way (the other being \"Better Living Through Chemistry\" which is used in a similar way by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department).\n\n\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\" was used in the 2000 film \"\", with the track also being included on its soundtrack release. Alternative rock band performed a version of the track on the cover album \"Higher Voltage\", given away free with issue 1164 of \"Kerrang!\" magazine. The song has also been covered live by Placebo, Foo Fighters and Machine Head. Rap duo Atmosphere entitled a drug themed song off their 2009 EP \"Leak at Will\", \"Feel Good Hit of the Summer Part 2\" in reference to this track. Atmosphere member Slug had previously stated his appreciation of Queens of the Stone Age.\n\nThe single's cover art features the title spelled out with various drugs, many of which are mentioned within the song. The song also heavily influenced the choices made for the title, cover and accompanying booklet of \"Rated R\". Themes included drugs and censorship, with the MPAA's rating system targeted specifically. Continuing as such, the album's liner notes contain several worded warnings for each song, akin to parents' guides most commonly seen on the covers for DVDs. Those listed for \"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\" include 'Adult Situations, 'Consumption' and 'Illegal Substances', referencing the drug-related content of the song. All of this would seem portentous considering the controversy the track subsequently caused.\n\nThe video also puts significant focus on the subject of the song. Created as an animation, it has a loose plot following a man driving under what appears to be the influence of some form of hallucinogenic drug. This is demonstrated by colour becoming more varied and vibrant in the song's chorus, with numerous literal representations of drugs featured throughout. The band are also shown performing the song through the technique of rotoscoping, which they would again use in the video for their 2003 single \"Go With the Flow\". The video culminates in the man's vehicle driving off into the distance and exploding into a mushroom cloud upon reaching the horizon. \n\nAll tracks by Joshua Homme and Nick Oliveri, except where noted.\n\nAs part of Record Store Day 2010, the band allowed the single to be released on vinyl for the first time. The record is a 10\" picture disc and contains all the songs available on the European and Australian release.\n\n\n"}

In addition to being credited with naming the tradition (originally spelled \"Faerie\"), he wrote many poems and liturgical materials for the tradition, as well as initiating many others into the tradition. His \"descendants\" have come to be known as the Watchmaker line of Feri.\n\nHe was a co-founder of two other organizations with Alison Harlow. One was \"Nemeton\", a Neopagan networking group. Nemeton quickly spread opening regional offices all across the United States, forming a huge networking organization that played an important key role in the early growth of Pagan and Wiccan networking in America. In 1977 Oberon Zell, Morning Glory and Alison Harlow co-founded the \"Holy Order of Mother Earth\" (HOME) as a monastic sanctuary dedicated to nature. Other pagans soon began to arrive and join them, amongst them: Anodea Judith, Eldri Littlewolf and Anna Korn. They formed a pagan-based magical working group representing many differing traditions, including: Feri, Dianic, British Traditional, the New and Reformed Druids of North America (NRDNA), Celtic/Shamanic Wicca, Church of All Worlds (CAW), Strega and elements of ceremonial magic. Later in 1978 Nemeton merged with the Church of All Worlds and became its publishing arm.\n\nThe other was \"Forever Forests\", an ecological mission dedicated to healing the planet through reforestation and other methods of addressing ecological issues. They held annual tree planting festivals on the land at Annwfn; since then tens of thousands of trees such as Cedar, Pine, Douglas Fir and Redwood have been planted all over Northern California.\n\nAfter being recognized for his music at a celebration in Wales in 1976, Pendderwen returned to California, quit his job with the Internal Revenue Service, and purchased a plot of the Greenfield Ranch in Mendocino County. Naming his parcel Annwfn after the Welsh underworld, he later gift-deeded the property to the Church of All Worlds with which he had long been involved.\n\nGwydion Pendderwen died in an automobile accident on November 6, 1982.\n\nPendderwen released his first album, \"Songs for the Old Religion\", in 1975, followed by a book of his music and lyrics titled \"Wheel of the Year\" in 1979. His second album, \"The Fäerie Shaman\", was released in 1982. Both albums and the songbook were well received by the Pagan community; the songbook included many songs which became classics within the community, and the two albums were collected as a two-CD set titled \"The Music of Gwydion\" and published by Serpentine Music. Pendderwen also served for a time as a court bard to the West Kingdom of the Society for Creative Anachronism.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It consists of over 13,000 kilometers of trenched fibre optic lines and wireless links, serving 429 communities. It is intended to link Alberta's public institutions, as well as rural communities and First Nations in the province. SuperNet was constructed as a public-private partnership between the government of Alberta, Bell West, and Axia NetMedia (who was contracted to sell wholesale access to the network).\n\nThe network, which began construction in 2001, consists of two components: a \"base area\" network which serves 27 urban communities, and an \"extended area\" network which connects rural and First Nations areas to the SuperNet. The network provides layer 3 connectivity. Parts of the network, especially in Northern Alberta, utilize wireless links instead of fibre. Linking Fort Chipewyan was especially difficult, due to its terrain and the protected Wood Buffalo National Park—necessitating a 120 km wireless link from the Birch Mountains. \n\nOn June 29, 2018, Service Alberta announced that it had declined to renew its contract with Axia NetMedia, and that it had reached a multi-year deal with Bell Canada to assume operations of SuperNet. Bell Canada subsequently announced the following Monday that it had also agreed to acquire Axia SuperNet Ltd., the local Axia subsidiary.\n\nSince Alberta SuperNet was not intended to serve as a last mile network, its success in bridging the rural-urban digital divide depends on private ISPs to connect rural homes and businesses to SuperNet. In many rural communities these services have been slow to develop due to the lack of a clear business case or economic incentive, resulting in criticism of this aspect of the SuperNet model.\n\nIn 2005 The Association of Canadian Engineering Companies gave the Award of Excellence to Morrison Hershfield for project management of the Alberta SuperNet.\n\n"}

{"id": "1905562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905562", "title": "Philip Keeney", "text": "Philip Keeney\n\nPhilip Olin Keeney (1891–1962), and his wife, Mary Jane Keeney, were librarians who became part of the Silvermaster spy ring in the 1940s.\n\nKeeney met Mary Jane when both were working as librarians at the University of Michigan in 1929. In 1931, he became head librarian and professor of library economy at Montana State University (now known as the University of Montana) at Missoula, where he made several improvements. By the mid-1930s, both Keeney and his wife were involved with left-wing political movements. In 1937, Keeney, although tenured, was summarily terminated after questioning book censorship by a local politician and supporting a proposal to revive a local chapter of the American Federation of Teachers. Supported by the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Association of University Professors, among others, Keeney brought a wrongful dismissal suit and, in 1939, the Montana Supreme Court ruled in his favor and mandated reinstatement. But, made ill by the stress, he soon resigned.\n\nThe Keeneys moved to Berkeley, California, where they became members of the Marin County CPUSA Club, according to Mary Jane's diaries. In 1939, the Keeneys founded the Progressive Librarians' Council (PLC). That year, the PLC endorsed for Librarian of Congress Archibald MacLeish,<ref name=\"McReynolds Winter 1990/91\"></ref> chairman in 1937 of the first open meeting of the Second Congress of the League of American Writers, which was \"founded under Communist auspices in 1935,\" according to a 1942 report by President Roosevelt's Attorney General Francis Biddle. As he was not a librarian, the American Library Association (ALA) opposed MacLeish's candidacy, but when FDR made his appointment, the PLC candidate got the nod.\n\nThe PLC also smuggled money to Emilio Andrés, commissar of an army corps of the Soviet-backed Spanish Republican Army, in exile in France after the Spanish Civil War. During the Hitler-Stalin pact, the PLC sent a letter to FDR urging him not to aid Poland, France or the United Kingdom, all fighting for their lives under the Nazi onslaught. (The letter had been phrased in such a way that it appeared to be from the ALA, but that group sent the President its own missive clarifying that the PLC did not speak for the ALA.) Once the pact broke down, and Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the PLC altered its position, advocating American participation in the war.\n\nThe Keeneys had a long list of political affiliations with alleged \"Communist fronts\" such as the Washington Book Shop, identified in 1944 by Biddle and in 1948 by Truman administration Attorney General Tom Clark as a subversive organization. In 1940, \"Keeney and his wife were signed on apparently by the Neighbors,\"—code name for Soviet military intelligence (GRU)—according to a 1944 report by NKVD agent Sergey Kurnikov.\n\nDespite Keeney's radical political views, activities in several \"popular front\" groups and socialization with numerous people involved in Soviet espionage activities, both he and his wife were able to obtain a variety of federal jobs between 1940 and 1947. Within months of the PLC's endorsement of MacLeish for Librarian of Congress, Keeney was working at the Library of Congress in Washington D.C., where he handled classified material. NKVD agent Jacob Golos allegedly met with him there.\n\nAfter the United States became involved in World War II, Keeney transferred to the Office of the Coordinator of Information, which was later transferred to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), precursor of the CIA. In a 1942 Venona cable discussing infiltration of OSS, \"Maksim\" (\"Rezident\" Vasily Zarubin, under cover as \"Vasily Zubilin\") in New York wrote to \"Victor\" (General Pavel Fitin, head of NKVD foreign intelligence) in Moscow, \"KINI is being entrusted to our agentura,\" meaning that recruitment was being undertaken. A note from U.S. cryptographers states \"KINI: If correct, probably Philip Olin KEENEY.\"\n\nFrom 1943 to 1945, Keeney was Chief of the Document Security Section in the Foreign Economic Administration. His wife, meanwhile, worked in the Bureau of Economic Warfare. In 1945, Keeney was allegedly transferred from the GRU to the NKVD.\n\nIn late 1945 he was hired as a social science researcher in the Supreme Command for the Allied Powers (SCAP) in Tokyo in occupied Japan. Later, designated \"Libraries Officer\" in the SCAP Civil Information and Education Section, he played an important role in promoting the revival and reform of library services in Japan. He negotiated the return of library buildings requisitioned by the Military Government and fostered the renewal of the Japan Library Association. His memorandum \"Unified Library Services for Japan\" of 8 April 1946 (aka The Keeney Plan) was a set of recommendations based on the California County Library System and stimulated discussion of new library legislation but was very incompletely reflected in the eventual Library Law of 1950.\n\nHis wife worked in France for the Allied Staff on Reparations. Both Keeneys had numerous contacts with Russian agents and sought to provide them with information, exerting \"considerable effort\" seeking to \"contribute something of value to the Soviet cause in which they believed...\"\n\nIn 1942 J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, demanded that Keeney be fired from the Library of Congress as a subversive. After investigating the Librarian, Archibald MacLeish, concluded that there was no evidence to support the charge and, when challenged, Hoover did not provide any and Keeney was retained.\n\nIn 1946, the State Department prepared a Top Secret chart identifying 124 loyalty or security cases on the department payroll. Later that year, State Department official Samuel Klaus prepared a 106-page confidential memo summarizing security data on each of the cases listed on the chart. One of these was Mary Jane Keeney.\n\nA 1946 congressional report named Keeney's wife, and in 1947 both lost their federal jobs and were denied passports. Within three months, Keeney attempted to leave the country without a valid passport, on the same Polish ship on which Comintern agent Gerhardt Eisler had escaped to the East bloc; the lawyer who encouraged him in this unsuccessful attempt to leave the country was Eisler's attorney.\n\nDuring the Judith Coplon spy trial that year, FBI surveillance records were published that implicated Keeney's wife as a courier for the Communist Party, observed upon her return from France in 1946 delivering a manila envelope to Bernstein, which he in turn delivered to Alexander Trachtenberg. Mary Jane herself admitted associating with Nathan Gregory Silvermaster and William Ludwig Ullmann. In 1949, Keeney was a sponsor of the National Conference on American Policy in China and the Far East and the Scientific and Cultural Conference for World Peace, both arranged by the National Council of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions, cited as subversive by the California Committee on Un-American Activities. Despite all this, by the following year, Mary Jane was working in the Document Control Section of the United Nations secretariat.\n\nAfter Sen. Joseph McCarthy publicized this in his 1950 speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, she was dismissed. The Keeneys refused to answer questions regarding membership in the Communist Party. In 1952, they were convicted on contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions before a Senate committee, though their convictions were later reversed on appeal.\n\nIn their later years, the Keeneys are variously reported to have founded and run a cinema club in Washington, D.C. between 1952 and 1958, showing art films, and reportedly opened a beatnik theatre in Greenwich Village called Club Cinema to air mostly foreign-language films with subtitles, with occasional folksingers or poetry readings. Keeney died in 1962 at the age of 71. He was survived by his wife.\n\nAfter the National Security Agency declassified the Venona project in 1995, John Earl Haynes, Cold War historian in the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress, identified Philip Keeney with the code name \"Bredan.\"\n\n\n"}

Fenwick was founded in 1929 as part of the Province of St. Albert the Great (Dominican Friars). It is the only school directly operated and staffed by the Catholic Order of Dominican friars in the United States. It is named in honor of Cincinnati Bishop Edward D. Fenwick.\n\n Fenwick High School was founded as an all-boys college preparatory high school in 1929 by the Catholic Order of Dominican Fathers and Brothers of the Province of St. Joseph. Since its founding, Fenwick has maintained a strict dress code which includes slacks, dress shirts and ties for the boys and plaid skirts and knee-high socks for the girls. During assemblies, blazers must be worn. Fenwick was originally intended to be a prep school for matriculation to the University of Notre Dame in the Midwest and Georgetown University on the East Coast, similar to Phillips Academy Andover's matriculation to Yale, Portsmouth Abbey School's matriculation to Fordham University and Boston College and Phillips Exeter Academy's matriculation to Harvard. Today, Fenwick's students matriculate to many top American and international universities. In 1939, the St. Joseph Province was divided and Fenwick High School became part of the new Province of St. Albert the Great, with headquarters in Chicago. Fenwick became coeducational in 1992, rather than raise tuition costs or see enrollment decline. Today, Fenwick is known as a secondary school. Students have access to many athletic facilities, including a baseball field, two football fields, a softball diamond, a pool, and a soccer field on the campus of Fenwick's Dominican Priory in the nearby suburb of River Forest.\n\nSince its founding, Fenwick has maintained a 100% college matriculation rate.\n\nIn 1983 Fenwick was selected by the U.S. Department of Education as a Blue Ribbon School. On January 18, 1999, \"U.S. News & World Report\" classified Fenwick as an \"Outstanding American High School\", making Fenwick tied for the #1 ranked preparatory school in the Chicago area. For 2009, Fenwick's 290 student class had 211 of them receive 718 academic scholarships to top universities around the country with the monetary value of these awards in excess of $16,000,000 (up from $13,900,000 in 2008-2007, $12,555,800 in 2007-2006 and 9,370,000 in 2006– 2005). The 2009 graduating class also boasted 187 Presidential Scholars and 30 National Merit Finalists, with 22 additional receiving commendation for being named to the top 5% in the nation. Fenwick's 2010–2011 class achieved $40,000,000 in merit based scholarships.\n\nAround the time Fenwick started admitting girls, there was a proposal to officially move classes to the school's priory in River Forest, or construct a brand new school in collaboration with nearby Trinity High School, its all-girls counterpart run by the Dominican Sisters. The idea almost passed, but was dropped when Fenwick insisted on maintaining complete control over the standards of the new school. Instead, Fenwick has commenced several expansion campaigns at their present location in Oak Park based around their original Neo-gothic designed school created by the New York architect Wilfred E. Anthony, who also redesigned the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Indiana for the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. The latest expansions include: a new field house with a 1,100-seat gymnasium and a 450-seat natatorium; several new classrooms and updated athletic lockers; a new school entrance and gateway inspired from the \"Arch\" of Northwestern University; and additional science laboratories and art studios, all of which are in keeping with the original Neo-gothic look of Fenwick's school and priory.\n\nFenwick is the only high school in the United States owned and operated by the Dominican Order. Fenwick's school mottoes are the same as those of the Dominican Order: \"Laudare, Benedicere, Praedicare\" (praise, bless, preach); \"Veritas\" (truth); \"Contemplare et Contemplata Aliis Tradere\" (to study and hand on the fruits of study). Fenwick often uses the Blackfriar as a mascot over a generic friar mascot since the Blackfriar is specifically associated with the Dominican Order.\n\nThe first sentence of the school's philosophy statement, defines the school as a \"college preparatory high school\". Students are required to study four years of theology, English, mathematics, and a foreign language in order to graduate.\n\nAs a part of the third year theology course, students are required to plan and conduct a \"Christian Service Project\". The project requires a minimum of forty hours of service, no more than 20 of which may be completed prior to the start of the student's junior year.\n\nThe school offers 18 courses as a part of the Advanced Placement program: English Language, English Literature, Art History, French Language, Spanish Language, Statistics, Computer Science A, Biology, Chemistry, Physics (C), Physics 1, Physics 2, Environmental Science, U.S. History, European History, Economics, World History, and U.S. Government.\n\nThe school offers AP Calculus BC, and gives students the option to take either the \"AB\" or \"BC\" test at the end of the year. Beyond AP Calculus, the school offers courses in multivariable calculus, linear algebra and differential equations.\n\nThe Fenwick Friars compete in two conferences. Male teams compete in the Chicago Catholic League (CCL), while the female teams compete in the East Suburban Catholic Conference. The school competes in state championship series sponsored by the Illinois High School Association (IHSA).\n\nThe following teams have finished in the top four of their respective state tournament sponsored by the IHSA:\n\nThe boys' varsity hockey team has played in the state championship game, held at the United Center, in five consecutive seasons (2002–2006), winning the state title (the Blackhawk Cup) in the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons. The 2003–2004 team compiled a record of 62–9–2 and is considered one of Illinois' most accomplished high school hockey teams to have ever played in the Midwest. The hockey team has won five straight Kennedy Cups, three of them over their hockey archrival Loyola Academy.\n\nThe boys lacrosse team took the state championship in just its second year as a varsity program.\n\nFenwick has been a dominant force in water polo. Since the IHSA first started sponsoring a water polo state tournament in 2002, Fenwick's men's and women's teams have won a combined eleven of the first fourteen state championships.\nPrior to the institution of a state playoff system for football in the 1970s, Fenwick competed to play in the Prep Bowl, which pitted the champions of the CCL against the champion of the Chicago Public League. Fenwick won two Prep Bowl titles at the game's usual home of Soldier Field. The first was in 1945 where a crowd of 80,000 fans saw Fenwick defeat Tilden High School, 20–6. The second was in 1962, and saw Fenwick defeat Schurz High School, 40–0. The win not only capped an undefeated season, but was played before over 91,000 fans; the third largest crowd to witness a high school football game in Illinois history. The 1945 game is tied for seventh in terms of crowd size.\n\nBy 2007, Fenwick had over 77 all-conference championships. The boy's JV hockey team and the girls pom pom team have also earned state championships. \"Sports Illustrated\" has added Fenwick to its list of the \"50 Best High School Athletic Programs in the Country\", recognizing Fenwick as having the best athletic program in Illinois. Fenwick's 2006–2007 swimming and swim/polo teams produced 12 NISCA Academic All-American athletes. For 2009, two state championships were achieved in water polo. 11 regional, sectional or supersectional championships were earned, along with 15 conference titles. There was also 17 All-State athletes, 19 All-American athletes and 12 All-Academic athletes named. 5 students were granted NCAA Athletic scholarships\n\nFenwick's academic teams are also highly competitive. The Math Team was state champion in 2002, in large part to the great teaching of Roger Finnell, a teacher there for 50 years now, and has also been the highest scoring private school in the AA Division for 14 years in a row. 2009 marks the 16th consecutive year for Fenwick's Math Team to qualify for state.\n\nFenwick's Scholastic Bowl Team has been league champions for the last 4 years, and has twice finished in the top four at the Illinois High School Association State Championship Tournament (2001 & 2004).\n\nFenwick is the 2011 Chicago Conference Chess Champions.\n\nFenwick's Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering (WYSE) and Junior Engineering Technical Society (JETS) teams are also highly accomplished; Fenwick's WYSE/JETS teams were national champions in 1989 are 13-time Illinois state champions. 2011 marks the 8th consecutive year to be so. The 2011 JETS team placed first in their conference with the highest possible score of 74/80, earning a \"Best in the State\" award and a 2nd place national ranking from 1229 teams of 43 states. Fenwick's team was only one point behind the first place nationally ranked team. After a two year championship drought, Fenwick placed first in the state and fifth in the world in TEAMS, beating teams such as University of Chicago Lab and Marist High School. \n\n\"The Wick\" (school newspaper), \"The Blackfriars Yearbook\", and the \"Touchstone\" (literary magazine), have all been recognized with awards by the American Scholastic Press Association. The 2006–2007 edition of \"Touchstone\" was awarded first place with special honors by the American Scholastic Press Association, placing Fenwick's publication at the top 5% of all high school literary publications in the country. \"Touchstone\" has earned 970/1000 possible points by the American Scholastic Press Association, thereby allowing it to be a contender for the \"Most Outstanding High School Literary and Art Magazine\".\n\nThe Fenwick Student Congressional Debate team is also ranked highly. In 2014, Fenwick Student Congress ranked 1st in the Northern Illinois District Sectionals, and had the most semi-finalists in State out of any high school. Student Congress has also been 1st in the Chicago Catholic Forensics League for five years in a row. 2015 will also mark the 10th year that fenwick has brought students to the highly prestigious Harvard, Yale, and Isidore Newman national tournaments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The town lies in the western branch of the Albertine Rift between Lakes Edward and Kivu. The Ugandan border is 15 km east and the Rwandan border is 30 km south-east. \nLava flows from the Nyamuragira volcano, 40 km south-west, have come within 7 km of the town in recent years.\n\nIt is the largest town formerly controlled by the rebel National Congress for the Defence of the People faction. As of November 2012, the town was a stronghold of the rebel, or self-styled 'revolutionary' March 23 Movement. After the defeat of the M23 Movement the town was retaken by the Congolese army, and President Joseph Kabila paid a visit to the town in November 2013 after driving from Kisangani.\n\nRutshuru has a Congolese Hutu population, and following the Rwandan genocide large numbers of Rwandan Hutu refugees were housed in camps there. The First and Second Congo Wars saw much fighting in the district involving Ugandan, Rwandan and Congolese forces of various factions. Since the official end of the war in 2002/3, fighting has periodically erupted between militias allied to the Hutu and Tutsi. The town has always been occupied by proxy forces linked to Rwandan president Paul Kagame and has since the advent of the Rwandan genocide been the focal of troubles between Tutsi and Hutu with stakes in Rwanda. As a result the indigenous people to the area, the Hunde have been victims of collateral damage between transfuse Hutu and Tusti. At the onset of all the Rwanda's invasion of Congo, Tutsi troops loyal to Kagame have been linked to massive looting and mass rapes of Congolese Hunde. Both Hutu and Tusti are not original inhabitants of Rutshuru just like in many part of North Kivu, but are descendants of imported Banyarwanda workers from Rwanda during the colonial period. Rutshuru much like most of the DR Congo western region is a town of collateral damage from infighting between Banyarwanda.\n\nThe Lueshe Mine is located in the Territoire de Rutshuru, north of Rutshuru town, exploiting one of the world's biggest reserves of pyrochlore, an ore of niobium. It is said to be the most valuable mineral resource of the eastern Congo but the mine has been officially closed for some years due to disputes over ownership of mining rights, the instability of the region, and the need to rehabilitate the mining equipment. Smuggling of pyrochlore by rebels under Laurent Nkunda is said to take place across the border into Rwanda. There are approximately 15 gold mining sites in and around Rutshuru.\n\n\n"}

It is made of either beaver fur or felt, and lined in white silk. Unlike many other articles of clerical clothing, it serves no ceremonial purpose, being primarily a practical item. (The galero is a ceremonial wide brim hat no longer usually worn, though on February 19, 2011, Raymond Cardinal Burke became the first cardinal in recent times to wear (for a single photo) the galero.) The cappello romano is not used in liturgical services. Since the general abandonment of the cassock as street dress, it is uncommon even in Rome today, though it was quite popular there and in some other countries with a Catholic majority population from the 17th century until around 1970.\n\nThere are some, mostly minor, differences in the designs of cappelli, depending on the rank of the wearer. The pope wears a red cappello with gold cords. Cardinals formerly also had the privilege of wearing a red cappello, but this rule was overturned by Pope Paul VI, and now Cardinals' cappelli are black, as are those of all other clerics.\n\nA cardinal may have a cappello with red and gold cords with scarlet lining. A bishop's may have green and gold cords with violet lining. A priest may substitute black lining for his. Cappelli for deacons and seminarians have no distinguishing features.\n\n\n"}

It is the capital of Équateur Province.\n\nThe headquarters of the Fourth Naval Region of the Navy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are located in Mbandaka.\n\nMbandaka lies on the east bank of the Congo River below the mouth of the Tshuapa River, a tributary of the Congo. South of the Ngiri Reserve, a large area of swamp forest on the opposite bank of the Congo, it lies at the center of the Tumba-Ngiri-Maindombe Ramsar wetland.\n\nMbandaka is the capital of Equateur province, and located only a few miles/kilometres from the equator. It is home to Mbandaka airport and is linked by riverboat to Kinshasa and Boende. The city's population was approximately (2004). The city is home to almost 1.2 million people in 2018.\n\nIt lies in a busy travel corridor upstream from the capital, Kinshasa, a city of about 10 million that is an hour's plane ride away or a four- to seven-day trip by river barge. \n\nMbandaka is largely populated by people of the Mongo ethnic group although people from many different tribes and regions live in the city. The main languages spoken in Mbandaka are Lingala, French, and Mongo.\n\nYears of war and neglect have taken a heavy toll on the city infrastructure, leaving no electricity or running water in large sectors of the city. Most of the streets and avenues of the city are dirt roads.\n\nMbandaka was founded in 1883 by Henry Morton Stanley with the name of \"Équateurville\". The town hall is about north of the equator. Mbandaka is one of the closest to the equator of any substantial city in the world. Stanley placed a large \"Equator Stone\" near the riverbank south of the city to mark the point where he believed the equator crossed the river. It remains there today. Due to its symbolic location close to the equator and the Congo River, there were early plans to locate the capital of the Congo Free State in Mbandaka, but they never came off the drawing board. These plans included infrastructure for an estimated population of 100,000 people, a train station, a Catholic cathedral, a governor's residence, and a palace for future visits of Leopold II of Belgium.\n\nIn 1886, at the beginning of colonial rule, the Belgians changed the city's name to \"Coquilhatville\" naming it after Camille-Aimé Coquilhat.\n\nIn 1938, work began on a bridge over the Congo River connecting Mbandaka with the French Congo. Work was abandoned at the outbreak of World War II, and only the foundations of the bridge pillars remain. In the 1930s the Belgian colonial administration began several projects, including factories and a new city hall. The city hall was completed in 1947 after World War II and at that time, with a height of , was the tallest building in the Belgian Congo. \n\nOn top of the city hall stood a statue of Leopold II. The city hall was destroyed by a fire in 1963.\n\nIn 1966, the city's name was changed, this time by the new independent government, to \"Mbandaka\" to honor a prominent local leader.\n\nHundreds of people (mainly Hutu refugees, women, and children) were massacred on May 13, 1997 near the end of the First Congo War.\nCongolese soldiers said the order came from Col. Wilson, head of a brigade of Kabila's troops, and Col. Richard, the brigade's operations chief, both Rwandans. A Congolese, Gen. Gaston Muyango, held the title of military commander but had no real power, they said.\n\nOn 16 May 2018, a case of Ebola occurred in the city, spreading there from an outbreak in the countryside. A new outbreak was reported on 1 june 2020. \n\nA large research centre for Central African history, originally set up by Fathers Gustaaf Hulstaert (1900–1990) and Honoré Vinck, is at the Catholic mission station of Bamanya (Missionaries of the Sacred Heart (MSC)), east of Mbandaka.\n\nOne of the finest botanical gardens of central Africa is at nearby Eala, about east of the town centre. The Botanic Garden of Eala, founded in 1900, contains between 4,000 and 5,000 species. It covers approximately with special collections (), forest (), marsh () and savanna \"Euobe\" (). The garden is neglected and unfenced and there is illegal logging. The last catalogue was published in 1924.\n\nMbandaka is the home of the world's first project of Habitat for Humanity International. Habitat for Humanity's founder Millard Fuller served as missionary with the Disciples of Christ Church in Mbandaka from 1973–1976. The housing project Fuller started in Mbandaka in 1973 became the original project of Habitat for Humanity when Fuller founded Habitat upon his return to the United States.\n\nThe city is located at the center of the Tumba-Ngiri-Maindombe area, designated a Wetland of International Importance by the Ramsar Convention in 2008.\nMbandaka has a tropical rainforest climate under the Köppen climate classification. Although precipitation in the city does vary considerably, it does not have a dry season; the driest month is January, averaging around of precipitation. The wettest is October with .

It is one of the Ngarrkic languages of the large Pama–Nyungan family, and is one of the largest Aboriginal languages in Australia in terms of number of speakers.\n\nIn the following tables of the Warlpiri sound system, symbols in boldface give the practical alphabet used by the Warlpiri community. Phonemic values in IPA are shown in /slashes/ and phonetic values in [square brackets].\n\nWarlpiri has a standard three-vowel system similar to that of Classical Arabic, with a length distinction creating a total of six possible vowels.\n\nAs shown in the chart, Warlpiri distinguishes five positions of articulation, and has oral and nasal stops at each position. The oral stops have no phonemic voice distinction, but display voiced and unvoiced allophones; stops are usually unvoiced at the beginning of a word, and voiced elsewhere. In both positions they are usually unaspirated.\n\nWarlpiri, like most Australian languages, has no fricative consonants.\n\nThe consonant phoneme listed in the table as a retroflex flap /ɽ/ is phonetically an unusual consonant [ɻ͡ɾ], possibly unique to Warlpiri. The tongue-tip begins in retroflex position, but then moves forward rapidly, flapping against the alveolar ridge.\n\nWarlpiri syllables are quite constrained in structure. All syllables begin with a single consonant; there are no syllable-initial consonant clusters, and no syllable begins with a vowel. After the consonant comes a single long or short vowel, which is sometimes followed by a single closing consonant. Open syllables are much more common than closed ones. No syllable ends with a stop or with the retroflex flap /ɽ/.\n\nThe most common kind of consonant cluster occurs when a syllable ends with a nasal consonant and the next syllable begins with the corresponding stop, but other clusters like /rk/ and /lp/ also occur.\n\nStress is not generally distinctive, but assigned by rule. Polysyllabic words receive primary stress on the first syllable, with secondary stresses tending to occur on alternate syllables thereafter; this rhythm may be broken by the structure of the word, so that there are sometimes three-syllable stress groups.\n\nIf two adjacent syllables in a Warlpiri morpheme have high vowels, then those high vowels are almost always alike; that is, both u or both i. The number of Warlpiri roots with adjacent syllables having u and i is very small. Both \"progressive\" and \"regressive\" vowel harmony occur. In progressive vowel harmony, the second vowel changes to match the first; in regressive harmony, the first changes to match the second.\n\nThis tendency to prefer adjacent high vowels to be identical also spreads across morpheme boundaries within a word. Adding a suffix to a word can place a u and an i in contact. When this happens, one of the vowels tends to assimilate: that is, it changes to match the other vowel. This kind of assimilation is called \"vowel harmony\". Vowel harmony is not rare in the world's languages: it is found, for example, in Finnish, Hungarian, Mongolian, and Turkish. \n\nRegressive harmony only occurs when attaching a tense suffix to a verb (see below). For example, when the verb panti- (class 2) is placed in the past tense with the suffix -rnu, the result is panturnu, not *pantirnu. Progressive harmony occurs with most other kinds of suffixes. For example, when the ergative case suffix -ngku is attached to the noun karli \"boomerang\", the result is karlingki, not *karlingku.\n\nOn occasion, long chains of high vowels can assimilate, each forcing the next. For example, when the class 2 verb kiji- is attached to the past tense suffix -rnu, the resulting word is kujurnu.\n\nNo Warlpiri word begins with an alveolar consonant; the first consonant of a word must be bilabial, palatal, retroflex, or velar. Exceptions to this include borrowings such as \"tala\" 'dollar', from English \"dollar\".\n\nAll Warlpiri words end in vowels. A word whose final meaningful component ends in a consonant is usually \"corrected\" by appending a meaningless suffix, usually -pa.\n\nSince the 1950s, Warlpiri has been written in Latin script using an alphabet originally devised by Lothar Jagst and subsequently modified slightly. The Warlpiri alphabet uses only ordinary letters, with no accent marks, and has the following deviations from IPA:\n\n\nTo these basic rules are added two adjustments to make the alphabet easier to use.\n\n\nWarlpiri verbs are built from a few hundred verb roots, distributed among five conjugation classes. Two of these classes contain the vast majority of verb roots; the other three classes have only a few roots each.\n\nA large class of modifying prefixes, or \"preverbs\", are used to create verbs with specific meanings. For example, the verb root parnka- means \"run\" when used by itself, while wurulyparnka- means \"scurry into hiding\". The preverb wuruly- is used with a few other verb roots to form other verbs of hiding or seclusion. Preverbs are sometimes reduplicated for emphasis or to create a meaning distinction.\n\nMost preverb-verb combinations are a fixed part of the lexicon; new combinations cannot be created freely. But there are a few preverbs that are very productive and can be combined with many different roots, and some roots will accept almost any preverb.\n\nThe verb root is followed by a tense suffix. There are five of these for each conjugation class, as shown in the following table. (Some optional variations have been omitted.)\n\nWarlpiri nouns are assembled from thousands of roots, with a rich array of derivational techniques such as compounding and derivational suffixes. Plurals are formed by reduplication of the root.\n\nEach full Warlpiri clause may contain an \"auxiliary\" word, which together with the verb suffix serves to identify tense and to clarify the relationship between main and dependent clauses. Common auxiliaries include ka (present tense), kapi (future tense), kaji (conditional). The auxiliary word is almost always the second word of a clause.\n\nThe auxiliary word also functions as the home for an elaborate family of suffixes that specify the person and number of the subject and object of the clause. These are similar to the familiar conjugational suffixes that agree with the subject in Indoeuropean languages, but in Warlpiri they are placed on the auxiliary instead of on the verb, and they agree with the object as well as the subject.\n\nAn example of a suffixed auxiliary word can be seen in the farewell, kapirnangku nyanyi, \"I will see you.\" Here, kapi indicates future tense, -rna is the suffix for first person singular subject \"I\", -ngku indicates second person singular object \"you\", and nyanyi is the nonpast form of the class 3 verb \"see\".\n\nIn the past tense, the auxiliary word often drops out completely. In this case, the agreement suffixes attach instead to the first or second word of the clause, as in nyangurnangku, \"I saw you\".\n\nThe junction where the agreement suffixes are attached can trigger progressive vowel harmony. Thus, nyanyi kapingki, \"(S)he will see you\", shows the vowel of the suffix -ngku (second person singular object) assimilating to the final vowel of kapi.\n\nIn Warlpiri culture, it is considered impolite or shameful for certain family relations to converse. (For example, a woman should not converse with her son-in-law.) If such conversation is necessary, the speakers use a special style of the Warlpiri language called the \"avoidance register\". The avoidance register has the same grammar as ordinary Warlpiri, but a drastically reduced lexicon; most content words are replaced either by a generic synonym or by a word unique to the avoidance register.\n\nThe Warlpiri language has a signed as well as a spoken mode. See main article Warlpiri Sign Language.\n\n"}

The oldest surviving building, St Peter's Church, is Norman. The name is believed to be derived from the Anglo Saxon word \"sharn\" meaning dung. Many of the older buildings in the village are constructed of the local oolitic limestone, also used in other traditional north Bedfordshire settlements.\n\nSituated just north of a loop in the River Great Ouse and almost due north of Bedford, the village has developed as a ribbon-settlement running south-east to north-west, with the core of the community clustered at the north-western end.\n\nThe village has two schools, the larger of which Sharnbrook Academy has a campus on the west of the village, serves a wide area and was attended by the marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe, who opened the Paula Radcliffe Sharnbrook Community Sports Centre named after her in April 2005. This Community Sports Centre is not only for students but also serves the wider local community of North Bedfordshire with sporting facilities. Students are aged from 11 to 18 and take both GCSE and A Level exams. The village's other school is Sharnbrook Primary which caters for young children aged from 3–11 years old who live in the immediate area.\n\nAnother major presence is the multinational company Unilever which has a research centre on the north-western edge of the village. This uses the grounds of Colworth House, originally built in the early 17th century and rebuilt in its present form by 1774 as a private house. The house itself is used as office space, with modern laboratory buildings beside and behind it. The site is being turned into a science park for use by a number of companies.\n\nSharnbrook is home to Sharnbrook Women's Football Club which was established in 2002. SWFC currently play in the Beds and Herts Division 1. The club's honours include the 2006/7 Beds and Herts league and cup double and the 2015/16 Beds and Herts Division 2 league title. The team currently play on a Sunday afternoon and wear blue and red vertical striped shirts with interchangeable blue and red shorts and socks.\n\nSharnbrook is home to many other sporting teams that both greatly predate the women's football team and significantly outstrip it in popularity.\n\nSharnbrook railway station opened in 1857, but was closed in 1960.\n\nSharnbrook is the village where the prototype of Uncle Silas, Joseph Betts, the protagonist of H.E.

{"id": "1905672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905672", "title": "Yahshuah", "text": "Yahshuah\n\nThe pentagrammaton () or Yahshuah () is a constructed form of the Hebrew name of Jesus originally found in the works of Athanasius Kirchner, Johann Baptist Grossschedel (1619) and other late Renaissance esoteric sources. It is to be distinguished from the name Yahshua found in the works of the Sacred Name Movement in the 1960s, though there has been some conflation or confusion between the two. The pentagrammaton Yahshuah has no support in archeological findings, such as the Dead Sea scrolls or inscriptions, nor in rabbinical texts as a form of Joshua. Scholarship generally considers the original form of Jesus to be Yeshua, a Hebrew Bible form of Joshua.\n\nThe essential idea of the pentagrammaton is of an alphabetic consonantal framework Y-H-Sh-W-H, which can be supplied with vowels in various ways. (Also, the \"W\" can be converted into a \"U\" or \"V\", since the Hebrew letter ו \"waw\" writes either a [w] consonant sound—later on pronounced [v]—or a long [u] vowel sound: see Mater Lectionis.)\n\nThe first ones to use a name of Jesus something like \"Yahshuah\" were Renaissance occultists. In the second half of the 16th century, when knowledge of Biblical Hebrew first began to spread among a significant number of Christians, certain esoterically minded or occultistic circles came up with the idea of deriving the Hebrew name of Jesus by adding the Hebrew letter \"shin\" ש into the middle of the Tetragrammaton divine name \"yod-he-waw-he\" יהוה to produce the form \"yod-he-shin-waw-he\" יהשוה. \n\nThis was given a basic Latin transliteration JHSVH or IHSVH or IHSUH (since there was no letter \"W\" or \"sh\" / [š] sound in Latin, and \"I\" and \"J\" were then not yet clearly distinguished as letters of the alphabet, nor were \"U\" and \"V\"). This could then be supplied with further vowels for pronounceability. It was a coincidence that the first three letters of this consonantal transcription IHSVH etc. were identical with the old IHS/JHS monogram of the name of Jesus (from Greek \"iota-eta-sigma\").\n\nIn Renaissance occultistic works, this pentagrammaton (or five-letter divine name) was frequently arranged around a mystic pentagram, where each of the five Hebrew letters י ה ש ו ה was placed at one of the points (the letter \"shin\" ש was always placed at the upward-pointing vertex of the pentagram). One of the earliest attested examples of this diagram is in the \"Calendarium Naturale Magicum Perpetuum\" or \"Magical Calendar\" (published 1620 but dated 1582) of either\nTheodor de Bry (Flemish-born German, 1528–1598) or Matthäus Merian the Elder (Swiss, 1593–1650). This idea of the \"pentagrammaton\" was funneled into modern occultism by 19th-century French writer Eliphas Levi and the influential late 19th-century Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Golden Dawn favored the consonantal transcription IHShVH or YHShVH, and the pronunciation Yeheshuah.\n\nHowever, in all early Hebrew or Aramaic sources, the name \"Jesus\"/\"Jeshua\" actually appears as \"yod-shin-waw-`ayin\" ישוע Yeshua (or as the related longer form of the same name, \"yod-he-waw-shin-`ayin\" יהושע \"Joshua\"; or as the intentionally altered derogatory Talmudic variant \"yod-shin-waw\" ישו Yeshu), so that the Renaissance speculations were incorrect. Note that the letter \"`ayin\" ע was specifically pronounced as a voiced pharyngeal consonant sound in ancient Hebrew and Aramaic, and could not be easily confused with either a pronounced [h] sound or a silent Hebrew letter \"he\" ה.\n\nSome modern religious groups have speculated that the most correct form of the Hebrew name of Jesus should be based on the spelling \"yod-he-shin-waw-`ayin\" יהשוע (apparently a reordering of the letters in the Hebrew spelling of the name \"yod-he-waw-shin-`ayin\" יהושע, pronounced [yěhōšūǎ`] and usually translated into English as \"Joshua\", but closely connected with the Hebrew form of the name of Jesus). This Hebrew letter sequence \"yod-he-shin-waw-`ayin\" can be transcribed into English in various ways (since Masoretic Niqqud is rejected), including Yahshua, Yahoshua, etc.—see Yahshua.\n\nWhen a final \"H\" is added on to these transcriptions (e.g., Yahshuah, Yahoshuah etc.), or when such consonantal transcriptions as YHSWH or YHShWH are used (both quite similar to the old transcription JHSVH, given the differences between the English and Latin uses of the alphabet), then it seems rather clear that there is confusion between the name of Jesus and the Tetragrammaton (whether under the influence of the old occultistic \"Pentagrammaton\", or independently). The consonantal transcription YHShVH is used both by occultists and Divine Name religious adherents.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1905676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905676", "title": "London Fields (novel)", "text": "London Fields (novel)\n\nLondon Fields is a black comic, murder mystery novel by British writer Martin Amis, published in 1989. Regarded by Amis's readership as possibly his strongest novel, the tone gradually shifts from high comedy, interspersed with deep personal introspections, to a dark sense of foreboding and eventually panic at the approach of the deadline, or \"horror day\", the climactic scene alluded to on the very first page.\n\nThe story is narrated by Samson Young, an American writer living in London who has had writer's block for 20 years and is now terminally ill. The other main characters are Guy Clinch, the foil; Keith Talent, the cheat; and Nicola Six, the murderee, who knows she will be murdered a few minutes after midnight on 5 November 1999—her 35th birthday—and who goes in search of her killer.\n\n\"London Fields\" is set in London in 1999 against a backdrop of environmental, social and moral degradation, and the looming threat of world instability and nuclear war (referred to as \"The Crisis\"). The novel opens with Samson explaining how grateful he is to have found this story, already formed, already happening, waiting to be written down.\nThis is the story of a murder. It hasn't happened yet. But it will. (It had better.) I know the murderer, I know the murderee. I know the time, I know the place. I know the motive (\"her\" motive) and I know the means. I know who will be the foil, the fool, the poor foal, also utterly destroyed. I couldn't stop them, I don't think, even if I wanted to. The girl will die. It's what she always wanted. You can't stop people, once they \"start\". You can't stop people, once they \"start creating\".\n\nWhat a gift. This page is briefly stained by my tears of gratitude. Novelists don't usually have it so good, do they, when something real happens (something unified, dramatic, and pretty saleable), and they just write it down?\nThe characters have few, if any, redeeming features. Samson Young (Sam), the narrator of the novel (who twice emphasizes that he is \"a reliable narrator\"), is an American, a failed non-fiction writer with decades-long writer's block, and is slowly dying of some sort of terminal disease. Recently arrived in London, he immediately meets Keith Talent, a \"cheat\" (small-time criminal) and aspiring professional darts player, at Heathrow Airport where Keith is posing as a minicab driver. Keith gives Sam an extortionately priced ride into town. The two converse in Keith's car, and Keith invites Sam to the Black Cross, a pub on the Portobello Road, Keith's main hangout. At the Black Cross, Sam meets Guy Clinch, a rich upper-class banker who is bored with life, with his terrifyingly snobbish American wife, Hope, and his out-of-control toddler, Marmaduke. Shortly after, the two both meet the anti-heroine, Nicola Six, a 34-year-old local resident, of uncertain nationality, who has entered the pub after attending a funeral.\n\nLater that day, Sam sees Nicola dramatically dumping what turns out to be her diaries in a litter bin outside the flat where he is staying (it belongs to Mark Asprey, a wildly successful English writer). The diaries tell Sam that Nicola believes she can somehow see her own future, and, bored with life and fearing the ageing process, is plotting her own murder for midnight on 5 November, her 35th birthday. Sam, who considers that he lacks the imagination and courage to write fiction, realises he can simply document the progress towards the murder to create a plausible, lucrative, story. He assumes that Keith, the bad guy, will be the murderer. Sam enters into a strange relationship with Nicola where he regularly interviews her and is updated on the \"plot\".\n\nThe novel proceeds on the basis that Keith Talent, the known criminal, will kill Nicola Six, with Guy Clinch as the fall guy necessary to provoke him into doing it (and, incidentally, to provide funds to help Talent avoid being beaten up by loan sharks, and to further his darts career so he can appear in the Sparrow Masters darts final the day before the planned murder). But there is an unexpected twist at the finale. Amis hints at a false ending, in one of Samson Young's terrifying dreams, simply to confuse the reader.\n\nKeith regularly cheats on and abuses his wife, Kath. He regularly sleeps with an underage girl in return for cash payments to her mother and has up to six further regular affairs he visits frequently. He drinks, gambles, and takes part in burglaries and semi-violent crime (although he is unable to follow through with actual violent crime). He is addicted to pornography and television to the extent that he is unable to distinguish reality from what is shown on the screen. He has raped several women in the past (including his wife).\n\nNicola is a self-styled \"murderee\", who manipulates the entire cast of characters to bring about her own murder so that she will not have to face ageing, a natural process that she hates as she fears the loss of her attractiveness and power to manipulate men, as well as the indignities of decay and old age. She describes herself as a failed suicide, who must find her murderer if she is to end her life. She spins a different story to each of the three male characters (Sam, Keith, and Guy). To Guy, she pretends she is a frigid, sexually timid virgin: she tells him that her childhood in a dreadful orphanage and her friendship with a tragic girl called Enola Gay who is raped by a \"pitiless Iraqi\" and who produces a child called Little Boy, has left her unable to form a sexual relationship with any man, but that Guy has awakened the possibility in her. Feigning love for Guy, she teases him sexually at every opportunity, pretending she is too afraid and too unready to \"go the whole way\" with him, until his unsatisfiable and excruciating lust induces him to leave his wife and child and to give her a very large sum of money which he believes will help her bring the fictional Enola Gay and Little Boy to London. Nicola insists that Guy leave his wife and son to consummate their relationship, and Guy does so, destroying his family life. To Keith, Nicola styles herself as a rich, knowing woman of the world, a former one-night stand of the Shah of Iran, who recognises him for what he truly is – a darts prodigy and future darts and TV personality. She gives Keith Guy's money, which he spends on ridiculous clothes and accessories. Keith, a pornography aficionado (and addict) is kept keen by regular \"home videos\" created by Nicola, starring herself. To Sam, Nicola pretends to tell the whole truth, but in fact manipulates him as well, in a way that is apparent to the reader only when Sam himself realises – at the end of the story.\n\nGuy is an idle, rich dreamer whose relationship with his \"frightening wife\" is sexless after the birth of their uncontrollable son, Marmaduke, who seems to have a violent Oedipal complex. Guy cheats on his wife and finally leaves her and his son to be with Nicola, although at the end, when he realises what Nicola is, he goes back home.\n\nSam is a failed writer who selfishly uses the three main characters to have a chance at writing a popular and successful novel. Although he knows that Keith is abusing his wife and someone is abusing their baby daughter, he does not intervene until the very end to remove the child from Keith's care.\n\nOne of the central themes of the novel is the link between reading and information-gathering, and the (un)reliability of written information, of narrators and narrative. Frederick Holmes writes that the novel dramatises a contest for authorship. All the main characters are authors of one kind or another, supplying Sam with written material, competing with each other to shape the narrative: Nicola's diaries, Guy's short stories and Keith's own darting diary together with his cheat's brochure of goods and services. In the shadows of the novel is the mysterious Mark Asprey, whose pen-name, or one of them, is also Marius Appleby, initials MA (the same as Martin Amis). As Mark Asprey, he writes what appear to be highly popular fiction, translated into innumerable languages. As Marius Appleby, he writes what appears to be a true-life memoir of his seduction of a large-bosomed lady on an exotic foreign exploration. But (as we learn at every turn) the written word deceives us: Asprey prints his own translations to look impressive and Appleby's memoir is exaggerated to the point of being untrue. At the end of the novel, it appears that Asprey has appropriated Sam's narrative for his own. Asprey is not famous for writing: he is famous for being famous – for publicity. One of the protagonists in Appleby's \"memoir\" complains of the inaccuracies in the text in a magazine article – another gossip column, a piece of popular media, whose own accuracy we cannot trust.\n\nMass media has corrupted the ability to read and led to disorientation, heavy reliance is placed on gossip and tabloids, neither of which can pass any test of accuracy. When Kath, Keith's wife, wants to read \"the proper papers\", she has to go to the library: her husband's tabloids don't make any mention of world affairs, it is impossible to tell what is happening from them. Keith's obsession with television, and with the fast-forwarded, freeze-frame version of television that he screens nightly, and with his tabloid newspaper \"The Daily Lark\", is so great that he becomes confused with reality. When he stars in the darts \"docu-drama\" – itself implying a dangerous mixture, or confusion, of reality and TV-fiction, he is unable to cope with the concept and it is Nicola who must \"translate him\" for TV.\n\nLondon Fields is a park in Hackney, east London, but the novel is set in west London, like most of Amis's work. The park in which the narrator, Sam, walks with various characters – Nicola Six, Guy Clinch and Keith Talent – is Hyde Park in central London. Sam reminisces that he played in \"London Fields\" as a boy, and wants to return there before his death. It is not clear whether the \"London Fields\" he refers to is the real-life East London park, or whether it has another meaning. The title suggests a paradox: a rural or pastoral place within a modern urban setting. Sam's narrative refers again to this inherent paradox, as he remarks that in London \"there are no fields\", only fields of attraction and repulsion, only force fields. The title indicates to the reader the ambiguities inherent in Amis's creation of an imagined London: there is a conflict between the descriptions of London locations within the novel and their location in reality. The topography of the imagined city cannot fit exactly onto the topography of the real city. Just as Sam realises that \"this is London and there are no fields\", and just as he is unable to return to the \"London Fields\" of his childhood, it is similarly impossible for us to return to the stage of London as a field. London Fields exists simultaneously as a real place in the real London, and as an imagined and dreamed-of place \"present all along\" on every page of the novel, and the scene of a murder. A theme in London Fields is pub culture, specifically the culture of Keith's \"local\" The Black Cross. The book also references The Marquis of Edenderry, a pub in the West London suburb of Acton. One of Keith Talent's darts matches takes place in the Marquis of Edenderry. Keith Talent also drinks at a late-night drinking club called The Golgotha.\n\nSimon Schama commented in 2011:\n\nBette Pesetsky of The New York Times identified the recurring problem of female characterisation within Amis' novels as a salient one in \"London Fields\". Bette Pesetsky wrote that the character of Nicola Six was \"not truly satisfying as character or caricature. She seems to be another of Mr. Amis's plastic women.\" The review concluded that the book \"succeeds, however, as a picaresque novel rich in its effects\".\n\nDavid Cronenberg was attached in 2001 to do a film adaptation of the book, and Amis wrote a draft of the script. However, Cronenberg would leave the film for \"A History of Violence\" and \"Eastern Promises\". Other directors attached include David Mackenzie and Michael Winterbottom. The film entered production in September 2013 in London, England. Billy Bob Thornton plays the narrator Samson. The cast also includes Amber Heard, Jim Sturgess, Cara Delevingne and Theo James. Mathew Cullen is directing. It had a wide release in US theaters on October 26, 2018 and is a massive critical and commercial failure.\n\nThe score was written and produced by Toydrum and Benson Taylor.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1905691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905691", "title": "Joel Brind", "text": "Joel Brind\n\nJoel Lewis Brind is a professor of human biology and endocrinology at Baruch College, City University of New York since 1986, a research biochemist since 1981, and CEO of Natural Food Science, a maker of glycine supplement products founded in 2010. Brind is a leading advocate of the abortion-breast cancer hypothesis, which posits that abortion increases the risk of breast cancer. This idea is rejected by mainstream medical professional organizations and there is overwhelming evidence in the peer-reviewed medical literature debunking it. Brind is openly contemptuous of mainstream medical professional organizations and journals, accusing them of conducting a deliberate cover-up with the goal of \"protecting the abortion industry.\" Brind asserts that the National Cancer Institute \"is just another corrupt federal agency like the IRS and the NSA.\"\n\nBrind grew up in Laurelton, Queens, where he decided he wanted to become a biochemist at the age of 10 after reading an issue of \"Life\" magazine where the cover story described the discoveries scientists had recently made about the inner workings of the cell, using electron microscopy. He has a bachelor's degree from Yale (1971) and a Ph.D. from New York University in biochemistry, immunology and physiology. Four years after receiving his PhD in 1981, Brind had a spiritual awakening, after which he converted to Christianity, and decided to try to use science to pursue what he saw as a \"noble task\" of discouraging women from having abortions.\n\nWorking on studies concerning amino acid metabolism and aging, Brind concluded that most diets are deficient in the amino acid glycine, and that this deficiency is responsible for illnesses caused by chronic inflammation, including arthritis, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. These conclusions are not supported by mainstream medicine. He also attributes what are thought to be normal responses such as pain and stiffness following strenuous exercise and injury, to glycine deficiency. In 2010, Brind founded Natural Food Science, LLC, through which glycine supplement products Proglyta and Sweetamine are manufactured and sold.\n\nFollowing his conversion to Christianity, Brind began working as a consultant and expert witness for the anti-abortion cause. \"Discover\" magazine reported in 2003 that since 1997, \"Brind has spent about 90 percent of his time outside the classroom investigating and publicizing\" his claimed abortion-breast cancer link, testifying \"in courthouses and statehouses in Arizona, Florida, Massachusetts, Ohio, North Dakota, New Hampshire, and Alaska.\"\n\nHe fought against the legalization of RU-486, testifying at a federal hearing that \"thousands upon thousands\" of women would develop breast cancer as a result of using the drug. Brind was an invitee to the National Cancer Institute's conference on the abortion-breast-cancer issue where he was the only member to file a dissenting opinion. In a meeting between Colorado Right To Life and the Denver affiliate of Susan G. Komen for the Cure regarding Komen grants to Planned Parenthood, Brind urged the breast cancer group to re-consider the idea that abortion is linked to breast cancer.\n\nIn 1999, Brind co-founded the Breast Cancer Prevention Institute, a non-profit group which promotes a link between abortion and breast cancer. The group is identified in the academic literature as an anti-abortion activist group that promotes \"the notion that a link to cancer has been both irrefutably proved and deliberately concealed by the medical establishment.\"\n\nBrind \"et al.\" (1996) conducted a meta-analysis of 23 independent epidemiologic studies. It calculated that there was on average a relative risk of 1.3 (1.2 - 1.4) increased risk of breast cancer. The meta-analysis was criticized in the \"Journal of the National Cancer Institute\" for ignoring the role of response bias and for a \"blurring of association with causation.\" It was also criticized for selection bias by using studies with widely varying results, using different types of studies and not working with the raw data from several studies, and including studies that have methodological weaknesses. The statistician who collaborated with Brind later stated of their findings: \"I have some doubts. I don't think the issue has been resolved. When we were talking about the conclusions, he [Brind] wanted to make the strongest statements. I tried to temper them a little bit, but Dr. Brind is very adamant about his opinion.\"\n\nExperts believe Brind overlooks the methodological weaknesses of some studies he uses as evidence for an abortion-breast cancer link. Furthermore, medical researchers note Brind overstates his findings since his own research shows a \"barely statistically significant\" increase in breast cancer rates. In reaction to the criticism an editor of the journal that published Brind's study noted with concern:\n\nHowever, in the light of recent unease about appropriate but open communication of risks associated with oral contraceptive pills, it will surely be agreed that open discussion of risks\nis vital and must include the people – in this case the women – concerned. I believe that if you take a view (as I do), which is often called 'pro-choice', you need at the same time to have a view which might be called 'pro-information' without excessive paternalistic censorship (or interpretation) of the data.\n\n"}

The family extended its interests to shipping, shipbuilding, fisheries, mining, metallurgy and ceramics.\n\nThe founder of the dynasty was Vincenzo Florio Sr. (1799-1868), who gave impulse to the tuna fishing and its canned preparation in Palermo. He also was involved in the sulfur industry and founded a bank. In 1832 he established a factory of Marsala wine and, in 1841, the Oretea foundry. As a ship owner he promoted the development of maritime communications with the continent, building numerous steamers. His son Ignazio Florio Sr. (1838-1891) considerably developed all the other industries founded by his father. In the beginning of the 1900s, the family had to face an increasingly deteriorated economic reality in Sicily and suffered failures and closures of activities.\n\nFounded in Marsala in 1832 by Vincenzo Florio Sr., the Florio winery (\"Cantine Florio\") has been in continuous Marsala wine production since then. Florio became the first Italian producer of Marsala wine. He built splendid cellars in the town's tuff rock in which to produce and conserve the wine. The winery carries the emblem of a lion.\n\nIn October 1861, soon after Sicily was incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy, Vincenzo Florio Sr. founded the \"Societa in Accomandita Piroscafi Postali-Ignazio & Vicenzo Florio\" (Florio Line) with a fleet of nine steamers. In 1881, Ignazio Florio Sr. merged with the Rubattino company in Genoa, giving rise to the Navigazione Generale Italiana, which operated a line on New York City. The company also ran to Mediterranean and Black Sea ports, Canada, India, the Far East and South America. At the time of the merger, the Florio Line was already a major company with a monopoly of the trade in the Mediterranean. \"The New York Times\" described the Florios as the \"merchant princes of Europe\". The Florio Line brought 50 ships into the merger, while Rubattino contributed 40.\n\nThe Cantiere navale di Palermo (Palermo Shipyard) in Palermo, Sicily, was founded in 1897 by Ignazio Florio Jr., grandson of Vincenzo Florio. Construction was protracted and Florio was forced to sell his stake in the shipyard to Attilio Odero in 1905.\n\nThe newspaper \"L'Ora\" was founded on the initiative of the Florio family in Palermo. The first issue was published on April 22, 1900. The formal owner was Carlo Di Rudinì, the son of the former prime minister of Italy Antonio Di Rudinì, but the main shareholder and financier was Ignazio Florio Jr.. The political direction of the newspaper was generally republican and progressive, representing the Sicilian entrepreneurial middle class.\n\nIn 1906, Vincenzo Florio created the Targa Florio, one of the oldest car races in the world. The first Targa Florio covered 277 miles through multiple hairpin curves on treacherous mountain roads where severe changes in climate frequently occurred and racers even faced bandits and irate shepherds. The race passed through many small villages, and fans lined up along the roads with no protection from the race cars. It was suspended in 1978 because of safety concerns. Today, the race continues with a different circuit as a minor racing event.\n"}

{"id": "1905713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905713", "title": "WKYC", "text": "WKYC\n\nWKYC, virtual channel 3 (UHF digital channel 19), is an NBC-affiliated television station licensed to Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The station is owned by Tegna Inc. WKYC's studios are located on Tom Beres Way (a section of Lakeside Avenue in Downtown Cleveland named after the station's longtime political reporter who retired in 2016), and its transmitter is located in suburban Parma, Ohio.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on October 31, 1948 as WNBK, broadcasting on VHF channel 4. It was the second television station in Cleveland to debut, ten months after WEWS-TV (channel 5), and was the fourth of NBC's five original owned-and-operated stations to sign on, three weeks after WNBQ (now WMAQ-TV) in Chicago. WNBK was a sister station to WTAM radio (1100 AM), which was owned by NBC since 1930. Although there was no coaxial cable connection to New York City, AT&T had just installed a cable connection between WNBK, WNBQ, WSPD-TV (now WTVG) in Toledo, KSTP-TV in St. Paul, Minnesota and KSD-TV (now KSDK) in St. Louis, creating NBC's Midwest Network. WNBK became one of the originators of programming for the regional network, along with WNBQ. Two days after signing on, on November 2, WNBK transmitted its coverage of the Truman/Dewey election results to the NBC Midwest Network. On January 11, 1949, WNBK began carrying NBC's New York-originated programming live via a cable connection to Philadelphia.\n\nAs a result of frequency reallocations resulting from the Federal Communications Commission's 1952 \"Sixth Report and Order\", WNBK was moved to channel 3, swapping frequencies with fellow NBC affiliate WLWC (now WCMH-TV) in Columbus in order to alleviate same-channel interference with another NBC station, WWJ-TV (now WDIV-TV) across Lake Erie in Detroit. After construction was completed on the station's new transmitter in Parma, the channel switch took place on April 25, 1954.\n\nIn May 1955, NBC agreed to trade WNBK and WTAM-AM-FM to Westinghouse Electric Corporation in return for KYW radio and WPTZ television in Philadelphia. Although Cleveland was a top-10 television and radio market at the time, NBC had long wanted to \"trade up\" its holdings to a larger market. Also, Philadelphia was the largest market in which it did not own a station. The swap became official on January 22, 1956, as NBC moved its operations (including much of its Cleveland staff) to Philadelphia, with WPTZ becoming WRCV-TV. Westinghouse took over the WNBK/WTAM operation and changed its call letters to KYW-AM-FM-TV on February 13, 1956. Westinghouse received a cross-station waiver from the FCC to own channel 3 since it has overlapping signals with Group W flagship KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh.\n\nDespite its success in Cleveland, Westinghouse was not happy with how the 1956 trade with NBC played out. Almost as soon as the ink dried on the trade, the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice launched an investigation, claiming NBC extorted and coerced them into agreeing to the deal. The investigators discovered that Group W had only agreed to the deal after NBC threatened to remove its affiliation from WPTZ (the present-day KYW-TV) and Westinghouse's other NBC affiliate, WBZ-TV in Boston, and to withhold a primary affiliation with newly purchased KDKA-TV, which ultimately affiliated with CBS despite its strong radio ties to NBC. In 1964, after an investigation that lasted eight years, the FCC ordered the swap to be reversed. NBC tried to appeal the decision, delaying the swap for one more year, but ultimately to no avail. Ironically, during the ordeal NBC was actually trying to sell its Philadelphia cluster it acquired from Westinghouse to RKO General in exchange for Boston cluster WNAC-AM-TV; NBC wouldn't own a station in Boston until purchasing WBTS-LD in 2016.\n\nNBC re-assumed control of the Cleveland stations on June 19, 1965. Instead of restoring the previous WNBK and WTAM identities, the stations' new call letters became WKYC-AM-FM-TV, mostly as a nod to Westinghouse's stewardship of the stations. The AM station, for instance, had become a top 40 powerhouse under the moniker \"KY11.\" WKYC-TV was separated from its sister stations in 1972, when NBC sold the WKYC radio stations to Ohio Communications. The AM station changed its calls to WWWE before restoring its historic WTAM calls in 1996, while the FM station became WWWM and then, in 1982, WMJI.\n\nIn a reverse of what took place in 1956, some radio and television staffers who worked for Westinghouse in Cleveland moved to Philadelphia along with the KYW call letters. This included news reporter Tom Snyder, news director Al Primo, and Mike Douglas. Other Westinghouse employees—such Linn Sheldon, Clay Conroy (who played \"Barnaby\"s sidekick \"Woodrow the Woodsman\" before getting a spinoff show of his own), and staff announcer Jay Miltner (who had been with the station since its inception in 1948)—remained in Cleveland. NBC also relocated many of their top Philadelphia radio and television executives and some on-air personalities to Cleveland, such as meteorologist Wally Kinnan. Kinnan's arrival displaced Dick Goddard, who had been with channel 3 since 1961. Goddard moved to Philadelphia with Westinghouse but returned to Cleveland in early 1966 and joined WJW-TV (channel 8). Evening sports anchor Jim Graner, who had joined the station in 1957 while also serving as the color commentator for the Cleveland Browns radio network, remained through the transition; he stayed on until his death in 1976. To this day, the Philadelphia stations insist they \"moved\" to Cleveland in 1956 and \"returned\" to Philadelphia in 1965 after the trade was voided. \n\nAt the same time, channel 3 enjoyed several technical advances with NBC's parent company, RCA (and after 1986, General Electric). It was Cleveland's first television station to broadcast full-time in color on September 13, 1965 (almost immediately after NBC regained channel 3 from Group W), the first to broadcast in stereo in 1985, and the first VHF station to closed caption its local newscasts for the hearing-impaired in 1990.\n\nAfter years of sagging ratings and continuing to be the lowest-rated of the network's owned and operated stations, NBC sold majority control of WKYC (51%) to Multimedia, Inc. in 1990. Due to its long ownership by NBC, to this day channel 3 is the only major station in Cleveland to have never changed its primary affiliation. At that time, Multimedia's entertainment division (now part of NBC's syndication arm) produced a number of syndicated daytime talk shows, and as a result Multimedia productions such as \"Jerry Springer\" (who himself had come from then-sister station WLWT in Cincinnati), \"Sally Jessy Raphael\" and \"Donahue\" ended up on WKYC's daily schedule. In 1993, the NBC peacock was dropped from the primary station logo, which italicized the numeral 3, was put in a square, and took a red-white-blue color scheme, though WKYC was still (and continued to be up until 2019) identified as \"Channel 3\" (the previous logo was a plain Helvetica \"3\" [also used 1976-84], and was modified to become the logo today, after replacing the logo used 1984–91, an abstract, rectangular 3).\n\nThe Gannett Company purchased Multimedia in November 1995, and acquired the remaining 49% of the station from NBC in early 1999. WKYC accomplished another first in Cleveland television history by becoming the first station in Northeast Ohio to broadcast in high-definition in 1999. Soon after Gannett bought full control of the station, it moved from its longtime studios in the former East Ohio Gas building on East Sixth Street in downtown Cleveland to its state-of-the-art Lakeside Avenue studio on the shores of Lake Erie, which Channel 3 refers to as its \"digital broadcast center\".\n\nAround the first week of October 2012, Gannett entered a dispute against Dish Network regarding compensation fees and Dish's AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper digital video recorders. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is affecting advertising revenues for WKYC. Gannett threatened to pull WKYC from Dish in Cleveland should the skirmish continue beyond October 7 and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement. The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.\n\nOn June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and home video media. WKYC was retained by the latter company, named Tegna.\n\nOn September 23, 2019, WKYC debuted a new logo (\"circle 3\" as seen above), began referring to their production operations as \"WKYC Studios\" - an umbrella brand encompassing their on-air and digital platforms, and began incorporating more lifestyle and human interest reports in their newscasts (under the branding of \"3 News\"); the station also now utilizes the \"3\" brand for general entertainment programming.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWKYC shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 3, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 17. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers continues to display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 3.1.\n\nThe \"-TV\" suffix was removed from the WKYC call sign on June 16, 2009. As part of the SAFER Act, WKYC kept its analog signal on the air until July 12 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.\n\nSyndicated programming on WKYC includes \"Dr. Phil\", \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", \"Entertainment Tonight\", and \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\".\n\nUnder Westinghouse's ownership, KYW-TV launched \"Barnaby\", a children's program which starred Linn Sheldon as the title character. The show premiered in 1956 and was an immediate hit, running on weekday afternoons for ten years. In 1961, channel 3 originated a local 90-minute weekday daytime variety talk show with former band singer Mike Douglas, which went up against WEWS' \"One O'Clock Club\". Quickly eclipsing the competition, \"The Mike Douglas Show\" became so popular that Westinghouse decided to carry the program on its other stations in 1963, and eventually to syndicate the program nationwide. WKYC-TV continued to air \"The Mike Douglas Show\" for many years after both the host and the program moved to Philadelphia, where it remained until 1978. Westinghouse also took the \"Eyewitness News\" name and format with it from Cleveland to Philadelphia; it would later return to Cleveland, being used on WEWS from 1972 to 1990. \n\nOne show that made the jump from Philadelphia to Cleveland was the award-winning documentary series \"Montage\", produced and directed by Dennis Goulden. This nationally acclaimed series of over 250 episodes investigated the issues and lifestyles of the Cleveland community during the 1960s and 1970s. \n\nOn July 1, 2011, WKYC became Cleveland's television outlet for the Ohio Lottery's daily drawings, as well as its Saturday night game show \"Cash Explosion\"; the rights returned to the lottery's former longtime broadcaster WEWS-TV (which had carried the drawings from the early 1970s until WKYC assumed the rights) on July 1, 2013.\n\nTwo NBC programs were notably excluded from the schedule of channel 3 under Westinghouse ownership: \"The Tonight Show\", which was reformatted after original host Steve Allen's departure as the short-lived \"Tonight! America After Dark\", was dropped by channel 3 in June 1957 and replaced with a late-night movie following the 11:00 p.m. newscast. NBC revived \"Tonight\" with Jack Paar as host in July of that year, but KYW-TV continued with its own programming, which also included the Westinghouse-produced-and-syndicated (new) Steve Allen, Regis Philbin, and Merv Griffin programs. The Paar-hosted \"Tonight Show\" would not be seen in Cleveland until October 1957, when NBC agreed to terms with WEWS to carry the program. KYW-TV also did not carry NBC's early-evening newscast, \"The Huntley-Brinkley Report\", for exactly one year comprising the 1959-1960 television season. As with \"The Tonight Show\", WEWS also ran this program. Also during this period, WFMJ-TV (channel 21) out of Youngstown was the nearest full-time NBC station to Cleveland. Many were able to receive WFMJ with a good antenna and UHF converter at that time. \"The Tonight Show\" returned to WKYC-TV's schedule in February 1966, after airing on WEWS during channel 3's Westinghouse years.\n\nIn March 2013, the station made national headlines when it preempted NBC's Thursday night sitcom lineup for two weeks with \"Matlock\" telefilms. Coming so shortly after it was announced about NBC's then sagging ratings, the decision was perceived to be a result of the lineup's poor performance, though WKYC's manager reminded many who had not noticed that the station has typically preempted the lineup for \"Matlock\" telefilms quite often for the past ten years (usually to provide \"make good\" ad slots for local advertisers whose pre-scheduled inventory was preempted by breaking news or sports coverage), and the move had nothing to do with ratings, and that NBC had begun to push new programming on those March evenings without much advance notice; WKYC had originally scheduled the films when it was expected the night would carry mainly encore programming.\n\nCurrently, the station's only preemptions outside of breaking news and weather situations mainly involve over-the-air simulcasts of Cleveland Browns games from ESPN's \"Monday Night Football\".\n\nWKYC has been the over-the-air home of Cleveland Indians baseball since the 2006 season. WKYC also provided studio operations for regional sports network SportsTime Ohio—owned by the team itself until 2013—which airs the remainder of Indians games on cable and satellite and simulcasts the games broadcast by WKYC. During baseball season, WKYC airs a weekly half-hour Indians-themed program, \"Indians Tonight\", on Sundays at 11:35 p.m. Matt Underwood and former Indians outfielder Rick Manning serve as the announcing team for the Indians telecasts. All Indians games and other related programs are broadcast in high definition. In addition to Indians games produced in-house by channel 3, the station has also aired Indians games aired through NBC's broadcast contract with MLB, first from its 1948 sign-on until 1989, and then for postseason games only from 1995 to 2000.\n\nWith the Cleveland Browns' move to the newly-formed American Football Conference after the completion of the AFL-NFL merger of 1970, channel 3, by way of NBC's rights to carry the AFC games, became the station of record for the team, replacing WJW in that role. This partnership would continue through 1995. Since 2006, Browns games are shown on channel 3 when the team plays on NBC's \"Sunday Night Football\", and since 2019, in a simulcast with ESPN when the team plays on \"Monday Night Football\". \n\nFor many years, the station has also partnered with the Browns to carry preseason games and coach's shows since then, outside of five seasons (including two short-lived season deals with WOIO in 1999 and 2004, the latter of which ended before the 2005 season due to team displeasure with the station's coverage of its ownership). WEWS carried the team's programming and preseason games from 2015 until 2018. The Browns returned to WKYC with the start of the 2019 regular season as part of a deal lasting through the 2021 season.\n\nWKYC aired select Cleveland Cavaliers games broadcast through NBC's broadcast rights to the NBA from 1990 to 2002.\n\nWKYC presently broadcasts 35½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5½ hours each weekday and four hours each on Saturdays and Sundays).\n\nUnder Westinghouse, the station debuted the country's first 90-minute local news block in 1959, called \"Eyewitness\" (a precursor to the \"Eyewitness News\" format).\n\nFor much of the time between NBC's repurchase of the station and the dawn of the 21st century, WKYC-TV's news department was usually a very distant third in the ratings, well behind WJW-TV and WEWS. Part of the reason was that during most of its second stint as an NBC-owned station, it served mainly as a farm system for NBC, with almost no local talent. Given Cleveland's status as a mid-major television market, most of the promising reporters or anchors that NBC employed at WKYC could end up being promoted to other higher-profile NBC-owned outlets, especially New York City flagship WNBC-TV or WMAQ-TV in nearby Chicago. Many WKYC alumni went on to long and successful careers with NBC; most notably, current \"Today\" weather anchor Al Roker served as WKYC's chief weatherman from 1978 to 1983. As a result of this practice, turnover at channel 3 was very high, and it was unable to establish any real talent continuity. In contrast, its two major competitors, WJ(K)W and WEWS, both had long-established anchor teams who often stayed together for a decade or more. It was by far NBC's weakest owned-and-operated station.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1984, WKYC tried to use the \"Action News\" branding several times while also using the music and graphics associated with the other NBC-owned stations, which employed the \"NewsCenter\" name. On March 19, 1984, the station dropped the \"Action 3 News\" name and adopted its current newscast moniker, \"Channel 3 News\". WKYC also adopted a new logo and a new slogan called \"Turn to 3\"; the accompanying jingle was composed by Frank Gari. The \"Turn to 3\" jingle and image campaign was borrowed by many TV broadcasters around the world—most notably Detroit's WXYZ-TV. Various anchors—such as Virgil Dominic, Doug Adair, Mike Landess, Dave Patterson, Mona Scott, Judd Hambrick, Leon Bibb and Dick Feagler—set designs, and imaging campaigns were tried out, usually with little to no success.\n\nTwo of the few long-tenured personalities during this time included Joe Mosbrook and Del Donahoo. Both joined WKYC in 1967 (Donahoo from WOW in Omaha) and enjoyed long tenures at the station. Mosbrook retired in 2002, while Donahoo was co-host of \"Today in Cleveland\" with Tom Haley until 1997 and a feature reporter (under the \"Del's Folks\" banner) until 2006.\n\nAfter NBC sold controlling interest in the station to Multimedia, the station tried to rebuild its news operation in the mid-1990s. They attempted this by putting more of an emphasis on local talent and continuity, using the tagline of \"We're Building Our Station Around You\" (complete with idents suggesting the slogan, by showing a physical logo for the station being sketched out, welded, painted and having the call-letters applied). Channel 3 even set up a telephone feedback hotline—dubbed \"Talkback 3\"—which was intended to field suggestions and comments from viewers about what they would like to see in the newscasts. Despite the more interactive approach, WKYC did not immediately reap any benefits coming from longtime CBS affiliate WJW's switch to (and eventual purchase by) Fox in 1994. However, ratings for WKYC's newscasts gradually began to improve towards the end of the decade. The station started to finish in first place in assorted time slots and posted some of the highest ratings books in the station's history.\n\nIn what was a somewhat controversial move, in September 1999, WKYC expanded its 6:00 p.m. newscast to one hour. This aggravated viewers because \"NBC Nightly News\" was pushed back from its long standing start time of 6:30 p.m., down to 7:00 p.m. This practice would be modified in July 2000 when \"Nightly News\" was moved back to its traditional 6:30 p.m. slot, and the second half-hour was used to start a 7:00 p.m. newscast, which continues to air.\n\nWKYC finally became a factor in the Cleveland television news race in 2003, after it had picked up the then brand new \"Dr. Phil\" program and placed it in the 5:00 p.m. time slot. This move proved to be very successful since all of the other local major network affiliates were broadcasting news at 5:00 p.m. and this gave viewers an alternative; it also allowed WKYC to be able to get many viewers to change channels at the end of WEWS's 4:00 p.m. broadcast of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" so as to watch \"Dr. Phil\" (which was a spinoff of \"Oprah\") at 5:00 p.m. (the syndication contracts for both shows disallowed them from airing against each other). During the broadcast of \"Dr. Phil\", WKYC heavily promoted its 6:00 p.m. newscast, which began to experience sharp ratings increases, which then trickled down to the 7:00 p.m. newscast.\n\nIn early 2004, viewers began turning away from WJW and WEWS' hard-hitting newscasts to the more traditional WKYC. This helped channel 3 rise to first place in the news ratings for the first time in decades; all of its newscasts won their timeslots. WKYC even managed to push WJW's popular morning newscast into second place. This continued until May 2005, when WKYC made two major changes in their newscasts: the station had its reporters extend the length of their stories, hoping to provide more detail; in attempt to combat the common viewer complaint that \"all news is bad\", WKYC also started inserting more \"positive\" stories into their newscasts. The combination of the two resulted in less \"hard\" news, and resulted in a drop in viewership. Over the summer of 2005, while \"Dr. Phil\" was in repeats, WKYC lost the top spot at 6:00 p.m. to WEWS.\n\nHowever, channel 3 retook the top spot in that slot during the November 2005 sweeps period. Additionally, despite fears due to a weakened NBC prime time schedule, WKYC retained its top spot at 11:00 p.m. which it has held for 17 straight ratings periods. In the February 2006 ratings period, WKYC will continue its first place streak by placing first at 6 and 11:00 p.m. Its morning newscast was second only to WJW's. On May 22, 2006, WKYC-TV will triumph to be the second television station in the Cleveland market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high-definition. In the November 2006 ratings period, WKYC's airing of \"Dr. Phil\" continues to lead at 5:00 p.m., and its 11:00 p.m. newscast held on to first place (though by a very slim margin over WOIO), although it slipped from first to third at 6:00 p.m. It came in last place at noon (it was the only \"Big Four\" affiliate in Cleveland not to air a newscast at that time slot). Channel 3's late-afternoon and early-evening slump continued from then on, reaching its nadir in the February 2008 ratings period, when both \"Dr. Phil\" and the 6:00 p.m. newscast finished third behind WJW's and WEWS's newscasts.\n\nAnother reason for the sustained success was that channel 3 had a measure of stability at the anchor desk for the first time in decades. From 2000 to 2007, its weeknight news team consisted of Tim White and Romona Robinson, chief meteorologist Mark Nolan and sports director Jim Donovan. The long-standing team was broken up in 2007 when Nolan was reassigned to anchor the morning newscast, and weekend meteorologist Betsy Kling was promoted to weeknights. In December 2008, White's contract was allowed to lapse and Robinson anchored the 6:00 and 11:00 p.m. newscasts alone until her departure at the end of 2011.\n\nOn January 3, 2011, WKYC expanded its weekday morning newscast by a half-hour, to 4:30 a.m. (WJW expanded its morning newscast into that timeslot on that same day). On January 16, 2012, former CBS News reporter/anchor Russ Mitchell became the new primary weeknight anchor and managing editor. On April 2, 2012, Kris Pickel became the new weeknight co-anchor with Mitchell at 6 and 11:00 p.m., marking a return of the traditional two-person anchor team at WKYC after three-plus years of solo anchors. In 2015, Pickel left WKYC and was replaced by Sara Shookman, who was previously a reporter/weekend morning anchor for channel 3.\n\nOn January 22, 2013, WKYC began using the AFD #10 broadcast flag to present its newscasts and other station programming in letterboxed widescreen for viewers watching on cable television through television sets; this change accompanied the switch to Gannett's new standardized station graphics package.\n\nIn 2016, after 37 years of serving as the station's political reporter, longtime channel 3 newsman Tom Beres announced his retirement after covering the election. The city of Cleveland then honored Beres by naming the section of Lakeside Avenue in front of the WKYC building \"Tom Beres Way\".\n\n\nWhen atmospheric conditions permit, WKYC's signal can be received as far away as Detroit and into Canada in Windsor and London, Ontario. WKYC was also carried on cable channel 3 in London prior to 1974, but was bumped to make room for Paris, Ontario's CKGN-TV, also on channel 3 at the time, and the flagship for the newly-launched Global network of stations across Ontario. The station is readily available over-the-air to Kingsville, Leamington and Pelee Island, and was once one of the three Cleveland area stations carried on local cable providers in those three locations; WEWS and WJW were also available until 2000, when Cogeco displaced Shaw Cable as the cable provider for Essex County.\n\nOn October 16, 2009, the \"Windsor Star\" had notified readers that digital subchannels of the Detroit and Toledo stations would be added, while the Cleveland stations (such as WKYC) and some Toledo stations would have to be dropped from the listings to make room for them, starting with the next issue of the \"TV Times\", released the next day. The only Cleveland local station remaining in the Windsor-area \"TV Times\" is WUAB.\n\n"}

An updated version of the game called World War Zero was later released for the PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows. Set in an alternate history in which World War I never ended, the game takes place in 1964, the 50th year of the war, and focuses on an Allied soldier's mission to stop the Russo-Mongolian Empire from developing nuclear weapons and his later efforts to end the war.\n\n \"Iron Storm\" displays a mix between World War I siege tactics, such as trench warfare and the use of mustard gas, and some World War II-style weapons such as machine guns, mortars, tanks, and rocket launchers of that era, as well as more contemporary technology such as helicopters, wireless communication, spy satellites, anti-personnel mines, and unmanned turrets.\n\nThe player character cannot take much damage before dying, and there are many enemies equipped with powerful weapons such as sniper rifles or anti-tank rifles. Several in-game glitches and vague mission objectives could often force players to replay one level multiple times before finally succeeding. Enemies also behave erratically, as seen when several attempt to walk through walls, or when the player shoots a particular enemy multiple times and yet the enemy remains unscathed.\n\nThe game is set in an alternate year of 1964, in which World War I never ended. The Baron Nikolai Alexsandrovich von Ugenberg seized Mongolia in 1921 in an uprising following the Russian Revolution, and later invaded Russia itself to crush the Bolsheviks. His plan was to establish a Russo-Mongolian Empire stretching from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic. With the help of the United States, the Allied nations of Europe were reformed as the United States of Western Europe, or the Alliance, in 1933 to counter Ugenberg's plan.\n\nInstead of the Great War ending in 1918, it was continued for almost half a century, with the battlelines drawn down Europe's center in 1929 shifting little for either side for the next several decades. As the USWE could no longer independently contribute to the war, the Alliance army was introduced into the American stock market, allowing private investors to speculate on the lives of the soldiers who carried on the war. The outcome of the war now depended almost entirely on the economy of the Alliance's member nations.\n\nThe player takes on the role as Lieutenant James Anderson, only 19 when he joined the Alliance in 1943, and now a legend among the soldiers in the field. Anderson is recruited for a possibly suicidal mission: to breach enemy defenses and stop the Russo-Mongolians from developing a deadly weapon that could devastate the world. Captain Cecile Newcastle of the British Royal Highlands Regiment is Anderson's immediate supervisor and is responsible for guiding him through his mission. Colonel Mitchell is the commander of the operation, but has an ulterior motive for wanting the mission to succeed.\n\nThe Russo-Mongolian Empire has its roots in the Russian October Revolution. After the Bolsheviks executed the Tsar and his family, the Baron Ugenburg, at the time already in control of Mongolia, took command of the White Russians and crushed the Bolsheviks with help from the Kazakhs. Within a few years, Ugenburg and his army stabilised Russia and absorbed the failing German Empire, bringing World War I to a standstill. Allied with Japan's Emperor Hirohito, Ugenburg also invaded China and allowed Japan to occupy Manchuria in 1941.\n\nThe United States of Western Europe was formed in 1933 to combat the Russo-Mongolian Empire. Consisting of most Western European nations as well as parts of Germany and Austria-Hungary, the USWE was supported economically and militarily by the United States and Great Britain.\n\nA classified mission was undertaken by USWE forces to assassinate the Russo-Mongolian Emperor Ugenburg and destroy a secret weapon being developed in the 1960s. The operation was a success, but did not end the war as a new emperor was installed by the Russo-Mongolian government shortly afterwards.\n\nPlayers take the role of Lieutenant James Anderson, a jaded American Special Forces soldier born in 1924 to parents he never knew (he was a war orphan due to the continuous conflict). At the beginning of the game, Anderson is given orders to infiltrate the Russo-Mongolian lines and destroy a secret weapons research facility, in the town of Wolfenburg, where the Empire is developing their first nuclear weapon.\n\nOn his way to the facility, Anderson battles through the war-torn countryside, sniping hostiles, going hand-to-hand with others, assisting both wounded and battle-worthy USWE allies (some with severed legs), braving enemy machine guns and flooded trenches, and in the process killing the Empire's three best soldiers, the Siberian Zahkarov brothers. Anderson then arrives at Wolfenburg and fights his way through the town toward the Wolfenburg chemical factory, which is the disguise for the Empire's secret weapons research facility. Anderson meets with a USWE operative, who tells him to access the facility via the lift at the far end of the chemical factory.\n\nFurther into the town, Anderson links up with the German Resistance, fighting against the Russo-Mongol forces in the town. The Resistance escort him to the gates of the Chemical factory, and Anderson proceeds alone into the facility. He then makes his way through the factory floor, destroying any chemical containers he finds, since the contents are being used on captured USWE soldiers.\n\nAnderson finds the lift, and drops into it via a hatch on the roof. However, the enemy have prepared for his arrival, and the lift fills with gas. Anderson is knocked out and is captured. He is then taken underneath the chemical factory to the weapons research facility, but manages to escape from confinement.\n\nAnderson then discovers why he was sent in the first place. At this facility, the Empire are attempting to make the first nuclear weapon, using heavy water. Killing the nuclear scientists, Anderson manages to put a halt to the research, for a while, and steals the arming device for the first two and only nuclear-capable missiles produced by the facility.\n\nSabotaging the facility, Anderson escapes on an armored train, the \"Tsar Ivan\", which is headed to the Empire's military headquarters, located in the Reichstag in Berlin. Through intelligence directed to him via Captain Newcastle, he learns that the first ever batch of heavy water created by the Wolfenburg Weapons Research Facility is also on the train. In an isolation case.\n\nMaking his way through the armoured train, Anderson manages to secure the isolation case. The case will implode, along with its contents, should it be forced open. A magnetic key is required to open the case, and this key is in the Reichstag, in the possession of the leader of the Russo-Mongol Empire, Baron Ugenberg.\n\nThe train arrives at the subterranean station of the Reichstag, where Anderson is ordered to steal the magnetic key. As a secondary objective, he should attempt to assassinate Emperor Ugenberg and hopefully bring about the end of the war. Before he can accomplish his objective, however, the Reichstag is stormed by American black ops soldiers led by Colonel Mitchell, who attempt to kill everyone they can find, including Lt. Anderson. Anderson eavesdrops on a conversation between Ugenberg and Mitchell over the Reichstag's security system, and learns the entire truth behind the war.\n\nIt turns out that an American organization of businessmen and military leaders known as the Consortium has been secretly funding the Empire's war effort in order to prolong the conflict and profit from Europe's steady demand for American war material and support. Mitchell sent Anderson to sabotage Ugenberg's nuclear weapons research because the Consortium had no desire for the creation of nuclear weapons that would tip the balance extremely in favour of the Empire. Thus threatening a victory, which would mean the end of the war, and thus their investments and financial gain.\n\nFeeling betrayed by the Consortium, Ugenberg declares that he will make peace with the USWE, so that he will leave behind a legacy as a peacemaker rather than a conqueror. Mitchell then kills Ugenberg, since peace would jeopardize the Consortium's continued profits.\n\nAnderson follows Mitchell, then breaks into Ugenberg's private quarters and kills Mitchell's second-in-command as they try to make their escape in a helicopter. After Anderson boards the helicopter in pursuit of Mitchell, the helicopter takes off and flies into the horizon just as a scream is heard from someone on board. It is left ambiguous as to whether Anderson has overpowered Mitchell and taken over the helicopter, or if Mitchell has killed Anderson, although the relatively downbeat tone to the ending seems to suggest Anderson's death.\n\nThe game ends with a televised Russian news report telling the Russian public that Ugenberg has been killed by Allied soldiers, and that the war will continue in memory of his name. An advertisement for a new type of machine gun that is expected to raise the stock market then airs. A quotation follows this ending scene: \"There is no greater naivety than the belief in the patriotism of capital. A capitalist may be a patriot, capital is not.\"\n\n\"Iron Storm\" was re-released in 2004 in the UK market for the PlayStation 2 console under the name \"World War Zero: Iron Storm\". While few things were added to the actual gameplay, the graphics were updated and many bugs from the PC version were fixed, and some new weapons were introduced, such as the flamethrower and the minigun. The PlayStation 2 version of \"Iron Storm\" was then ported back to the PC in 2005 as \"World War Zero\" and published by Reef Entertainment. This version of the game was released only in the UK and Russia. The additions in this third version consisted of support for anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering, new save points, support for widescreen displays, and bloom lighting. Multiplayer modes were completely cut out along with the majority of the cutscenes, the quick-save feature, and third-person mode. Support for the native resolution of 17\" and 19\" TFT screens (1280x1024) was also dropped. The levels were reworked and simplified, and character models were also improved.\n\nThe first-person shooter \"\" has been described as a spiritual sequel to \"Iron Storm\" by the game's developers. Many of the people who worked on \"Bet on Soldier\" had previously worked on \"Iron Storm\". Although it is never explicitly stated that the two games take place in the same fictional universe, they share many of the same themes and plot elements, and even similar character and weapon designs. Also Bet on Soldier takes place in the 1990 making it an Alternative History and it is never described how the world of Bet on Soldier came about in the game except that the world had been at war for eighty years.\n\nConcept art from 2003 indicates that Iron Storm 2 was originally planned to be released. It depicts four levels; the Paris Gun - a super railway gun next to a military train station, a European stock exchange hub, a broken tanker in Alaska next to a base, and a heavily guarded Alaskan oil pipeline.\n\nIGN gave \"Iron Storm\" an 8.0 out of 10, citing impressive overall gameplay and a unique storyline, but criticized the game's many glitches, overly-linear levels, and lackluster multiplayer mode. Aggregating review website GameRankings gave the game an overall score of 70.76%.\n\nEurogamer thought the PS2 release was unoriginal and contained elements from many other video games. It was still regarded as a fun game, however; and the multiplayer element was said to be \"highly commendable\", though reminiscent of Red Faction 2. It was rated 6/10.\n\n"}

{"id": "1905731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905731", "title": "Frank L. Shaw", "text": "Frank L. Shaw\n\nFrank L. Shaw (February 1, 1877 – January 24, 1958) was the first mayor of a major American city to be recalled from office, in 1938. He was also a member of the Los Angeles City Council and then the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. His administration was seen as one of the most corrupt in Los Angeles history, although he had some defenders and was never charged officially with any crime.\n\nShaw, the son of John D. Shaw and Katherine Roche, was born February 1, 1877, in or near Warwick, Ontario. He had a brother, Joseph. The family moved to Detroit, Michigan, then Colorado in the late 1880s and Kansas, before settling in Missouri. He went to public schools in Denver and in Joplin, Missouri. He studied business and then began clerking in a country store in Joplin and soon became a salesman with the Campbell-Redell Wholesale Grocery Company. He remained in the grocery business for thirty years, except when he was briefly with the Ozark Coal and Railroad Company at Fort Smith, Arkansas. As a representative of the Cudahy Packing Company, Shaw moved to Los Angeles in 1909. In 1919 he joined the Haas-Baruch Company in Los Angeles and left it when he was elected to the city council.\n\nShaw's childhood affliction with polio left him with a noticeable limp for the rest of his life.\n\nHe was married to Cora H. Shires on February 5, 1905, in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and in 1909 the couple moved to Los Angeles. They had no children. She died in 1951 at the age of 68. At age 76, Frank Shaw was secretly married in Tijuana, Mexico to Dortha Sheehan, age 22, and revealed the fact three years later, in January 1956.\n\nShaw was a member of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, the United Commercial Travelers of America, the Los Angeles Athletic and Jonathan clubs, the Presbyterian Church, Masonic Temple 320, the Shriners and the Elks, Moose, Eagles and Maccabee lodges.\n\nHe died of cancer on January 24, 1958. His residence then with Dortha was 101 or 108 West 71st Street, in the Florence district. Burial took place in Inglewood Park Cemetery.\n\nAfter Shaw's death, a will leaving all of his estate to Dortha Shaw was contested in court by a group of the former mayor's relatives, led by Shaw's niece, Frances S. Lawrence, and his brother, Joseph. A jury sided with the Lawrence claim that Shaw had been unduly influenced by his new wife, but the verdict was not put into effect because all of the parties later agreed to a settlement.\n\nShaw was a large property owner who was active in the United Commercial Travelers' Association when he filed for the 1925 election in the 8th Councilmanic District. He was then living at 110 West 59th Place in the Florence District. He won reelection to two-year terms in 1925 and 1927.\n\nDistrict 8 in 1925 included the area south of Washington Street, north of Jefferson on the western side and north of Slauson Avenue on the eastern side, bounded on the east by Alameda Street and the Vernon city line. In 1926 it was described as bounded by 47th Street, Vermont Avenue, Florence Avenue and Alameda Street.\n\nBoth Shaw and Council Member R.S. Sparks raised criticism in advance of the May 1927 primary election when they each sent letters on city stationery to people who were on a tentative list for appointment as election workers asking them to call on the two councilmen to discuss, in the words of Shaw's letter, \"several matters which I believe will prove advantageous to you.\" Shaw denied that he was attempting to influence the prospective workers to influence his candidacy.\n\nShaw ran for the Board of Supervisors in 1928 and easily ousted Supervisor Jack Bean, who had attempted to mock Shaw as \"the grocery boy who made good.\" He was reelected in 1930 and 1932 and was named chairman of the board by his fellow supervisors in 1932 and 1933.\n\nOn the board he proposed the establishment of a county psychopathic clinic, which he said would be to \"keep people out of asylums and prisons, not put them in.\" He was named chairman of a countywide committee on employment formed to help fight the \"present crisis in the unemployment situation,\" and he proposed that employees in \"all governmental departments as well as private business and industry\" should be given a five-day week, \"or a shorter work day,\" to meet the situation.\n\nIn March 1933, Shaw abandoned his previous temperance stand in the battle over Prohibition repeal when he joined a 3-2 majority in deciding to repeal a county ordinance that was even more drastic than the national Volstead Act, which controlled the production and sale of liquor throughout the United States.\n\nWhile still a supervisor, Shaw ran for the mayoralty of Los Angeles in 1933 against the incumbent, John C. Porter, and was elected in the final vote, 187,053 to 155,513.\n\nDuring his term, the Los Angeles International Airport and the Slauson Avenue storm drain projects were developed by the Works Progress Administration, the Los Angeles Harbor became home base for the Pacific Fleet and the city employees' retirement system was begun. Union Station and the downtown Federal Building were constructed.\n\nMeanwhile, though, the corruption in City Hall led to a recall movement against him and his close associates. \"Police misconduct and the mayor’s mishandling of public funds forced Shaw from office and led to the election of reform mayor Fletcher Bowron in 1938.\" He was the first mayor of a major American city to be recalled from office. Previously Mayors Arthur C. Harper and Porter had faced recalls; Harper resigned before the date of the scheduled election, and Porter was sustained in office.\n\nCitizenship\n\nA major controversy erupted after Shaw's election as mayor when Charles A. Butler, former secretary of the Eagle Rock Chamber of Commerce, filed suit, alleging that Shaw was not a citizen and therefore could not be sworn into office. It developed that Shaw's Canadian-born father had taken out his first U.S. citizenship papers in Hays City, Kansas, in 1887, but no record could be found of a final disposition. The matter was finally settled on July 24, 1933, when Shaw took the oath of allegiance to the United States, and Butler withdrew his suit.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nShaw sued Warner Bros. in October 1939 for $1 million in damages, alleging he was defamed in \"The Man Who Dared,\" a motion picture supposedly based on the January 14, 1938 bombing of private investigator Harry Raymond while he was sitting in his automobile in the garage of his Los Angeles home. Shaw said the plot \"contains a chain of circumstances which leaves the unmistakeable impression\" that it was a \"fictionalized version of the Raymond bombing.\" He said the film depicts him, Shaw, as having ordered his police aides to plant the bomb that severely injured a private investigator named Harry. The studio replied that the events were fictional and could have happened in any American city. The suit was settled out of court in February 1941, with both sides agreeing there would be no statement as to the terms.\n\nBombing\n\nRaymond, the real victim of the bombing, sued Shaw and 14 other former civic leaders and police officials in June 1940. Raymond said Shaw owed him $500 from a $30,000 out-of-court settlement that had previously been reached over the incident. Shaw issued an \"indignant denial\" that he had ever \"negotiated or paid any portion\" of Raymond's suit against him.\n\nLibel\n\nTwo 1942 lawsuits by Shaw charging Macfadden Publications and others with libel in the publication of articles in 1939 about his administration in \"Liberty\" magazine were settled out of court after the trial of one of them resulted in a hung jury. The first article, \"The Lid Off Los Angeles,\" ran in installments beginning November 11, 1939, and included the statement:\n\nUntil the boodling Shaw machine was handed its hat and a decent and unfettered man was elected Mayor in September, 1938, the city of Los Angeles for 20 years had been, almost uninterruptedly, run by an underworld government invisible to the average citizen.\n\nThe second article was said to have been based on material furnished by the wife of anti-vice crusader Clifford Clinton under the title \"My Husband's Death Struggle With the Vice Czars of Los Angeles.\"\n\nAt the same time the Shaw suits were settled, a claim by Clifford Clinton against Shaw was also laid to rest. Clinton had sued Shaw for libel in having claimed that he, Clinton, had taken \"large sums of money from questionable sources for use in the 1938 recall campaign against Shaw.\" The exact terms of the settlements were not disclosed.\n\nOil lease\n\nIn 1951, Shaw lost a suit for damages he filed against Paul R. Ritter, a former business partner, concerning an oil lease in the Cuyama Valley in Kern County. Ritter had been Shaw's manager in the 1933 campaign for mayor and was later appointed by Shaw as president of the city's Board of Public Works.\n\nAccess to most of the \"Los Angeles Times\" links requires the use of a library card.\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball as a shortstop from to for the Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals and the Chicago White Sox. A six-time All-Star, he was a light-hitting, defensive specialist who spent the majority of his career as the Chicago Cubs starting shortstop. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he was considered one of the best shortstops in baseball. Kessinger is also notable for being the last player-manager in American League history.\n\nA four sport All-State and All-America athlete for the Forrest City High School Mustangs, Kessinger graduated high school in 1960 and went on to the University of Mississippi. During his collegiate years, he earned All-Conference, All-SEC, and All-America honors in both basketball and baseball for the Rebels, and was initiated into the Sigma Nu fraternity. Kessinger also played for the Peoria Pacers, of the Central Illinois Collegiate League (a summer league for collegiate players) in its founding year, 1963. He was signed by the Chicago Cubs as an amateur free agent on June 19, 1964. Kessinger was assigned to play for the Double-A Fort Worth Cats before making his major league debut on September 7, 1964.\n\nHe returned to the minor leagues with the neophyte Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs for the 1965 season, but was brought back by the Cubs in June of that year and became their starting shortstop. The 1965 season would mark the first of nine consecutive seasons in which Kessinger would work alongside Cubs' second baseman Glenn Beckert. He ended the season hitting for a .201 batting average and led the National League shortstops in errors but, showed some promise by leading the league in range factor.\n\nAs the 1966 season got underway, Kessinger continued to struggle with his hitting when, new Cubs manager Leo Durocher encouraged him to become a switch hitter. With the help of coach Pete Reiser, his hitting began to improve, posting for a .304 batting average during the second half of the season. Durocher made Kessinger his lead off hitter, a spot he would hold for many years. He ended the year with a career-high .274 batting average and led the league's shortstops with 474 assists.\nKessinger continued to improve his fielding and in , he was recognized as one of the top shortstops in the league when he was voted to be the starting shortstop for the National League in the 1968 All-Star Game. At the end of the season, he ranked first among the league's shortstops in range factor and, led the entire league in assists. While he also led the league in errors, he attributed this to the fact that he reached more ground balls than the average shortstop.\n\nKessinger repeated as an All-Star in 1969, in a year which saw the entire Chicago Cubs infield join him on the 1969 All-Star team, with Kessinger and Cubs' third baseman Ron Santo in the starting line-up. In , he set a major league single-season record for shortstops by playing in 54 games without committing an error, breaking the record previously set by Chico Carrasquel in . The Cubs were in first place in the National League Eastern Division for 180 days of the 1969 season, before going 8-17 in their final 25 games, while the New York \"Miracle\" Mets went 37-11 in their final 48 games to clinch the Eastern Division pennant. Despite the Cubs' late-season collapse, Kessinger scored 109 runs, hit for a .273 batting average with a career-high 181 hits, including 38 doubles; second-most in the league. He led the league's shortstops in putouts, finished second in fielding percentage and once again led the entire National League in assists. He finished in 15th place in balloting for the 1969 National League Most Valuable Player Award and won his first Gold Glove Award. In his book, \"The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract\", baseball historian Bill James cited manager Durocher's method of using his regular players everyday without any rest days as a factor in the Cubs' collapse. On September 9, 1969, Kessinger was in the batters box at Shea Stadium when a black cat emerged from under the stands. After staring at Kessinger and Santo (in the on-deck circle), it headed toward the Cubs' bench, where Durocher received a raised tail and hiss.\n\nDuring a July 4 interview in 1969 with then St. Louis Cardinals sportscaster Harry Caray, Cubs pitcher, Ferguson Jenkins, gave a name to Kessinger's trademark play at shortstop—The Down Pat. Children from throughout WGN's viewing audience widely copied it on playgrounds and in Little League games, and his fellow players typically stood in awe. Carey noted that Kessinger would regularly go to his right, toward left field, spear the ground ball and then, demonstrating a unique agility, reverse while in the air as he whipped the ball toward first base. \"Do you think it might be because Don was a great basketball player?\" asked Caray. Without hesitation, Jenkins responded, \"In the past five games he's made many great plays to his right. Don has this play down pat.\"\n\nKessinger had another good season in 1970, producing a .266 batting average while scoring 100 runs. He led the entire league in assists for the third consecutive year and claimed his second Gold Glove Award. On June 17, 1971 he went 6-for-6, becoming the first Cubs with a six hit game in nearly 34 years. He continued to be one of the cornerstones of the Cubs' infield, earning three more All-Star berths in 1971, 1972 and 1974. In October 1975, after 11 seasons with the Cubs, Kessinger was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals—for pitcher Mike Garman and infielder Bobby Hrapmann. He was the last remaining Cub from the 1969 season when they almost won the pennant.\n\nThe 33-year-old Kessinger still played well in St. Louis, ending the season with a .320 on-base percentage and was second in the league in range factor. In August 1977, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox—for pitcher Steve Staniland—who were seeking to bolster their infield strength. The White Sox held a \"Don Kessinger Night\" on September 8, 1978, where 31,000 Chicago baseball fans (said to consist, in Baseball Digest, of nearly equal numbers of Sox and Cubs fans) thanked #11 for his years of service at shortstop. On October 19, 1978, White Sox President Bill Veeck named Kessinger to be the team's player-manager (the last in AL history). He was managing at Comiskey Park on July 12, 1979 when the infamous \"Disco Demolition Night\" took place, and wisely locked his players in the locker room between games, avoiding the near-riot. With the White Sox languishing in 5th place in the standings, Kessinger resigned on August 2, 1979 and was replaced by Tony La Russa.\n\nIn a 16-year major league career, Kessinger played in 2,078 games, accumulating 1,931 hits in 7,651 at bats for a .252 career batting average along with 14 home runs, 527 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .314. He retired with a .965 fielding percentage. A six-time All-Star, Kessinger won the National League Gold Glove for shortstops in and . In three different seasons with the Cubs, he turned 100 or more double plays. Kessinger had 6,212 assists during his career, ranking him 14th all-time among major league shortstops. In 1977 he was named the recipient of the Danny Thomas Memorial Award, for his exemplary Christian Spirit in Major League Baseball and, the following year he was the recipient of the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, presented annually to the Major League baseball player who both on and off the field best exemplifies the character of Lou Gehrig. Kessinger received 0.5% of the vote on the Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1985, his only appearance on the balloting.\n\nKessinger married Carolyn Crawley—also from Forrest City—in 1965. Their son Keith Kessinger was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in 1989 and had a brief career (nine years, minors and majors, in the Reds and Cubs organizations) as a professional baseball player, and son Kevin was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in 1992, but was sidelined during his first season with the Geneva (NY) Cubs by a back injury.\n\nPrior to the 1991 season, Kessinger was hired as the head baseball coach at his alma mater, the University of Mississippi. Kessinger would spend six years as the Ole Miss skipper, leading the Rebels to four 30-win seasons. His 1995 team produced a school record for wins, going 40-22 and earning the school's first NCAA Regional bid since 1977. Ole Miss finished on the verge of its first World Series appearance since 1972, placing second at the NCAA Atlantic I Regional behind host-Florida State. Both of his sons had the opportunity to play for their father at Ole Miss. Following the 1996 season, Kessinger resigned his head coaching position to become Mississippi's Associate Athletics Director for Internal Affairs, while concurrently serving as Chair of the NCAA Baseball Rules Committee. He finished with a six-year record of 185-153.\n\nKessinger was an honoree at the 1976 Chicago Baseball Writers Diamond Dinner, where he was presented with the Ken Hubbs Award, given for exemplary conduct both on and off the field. He has also honored by the Chicago(land) Sports Hall of Fame, Chicago Cubs Hall of Fame, Wrigley Field Walk of Fame, Ole Miss Sports Hall of Fame, Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame, National High School Sports Hall of Fame and the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame. He was also recognized as the 12th Best Athlete in the history of the Southeastern Conference in 2007 and named to the Ole Miss All-Century Basketball Team in 2008. Presently, he is the President of Kessinger Enterprises, Inc. and owns a real estate business in Oxford, Mississippi.\n\nWhile writing his 2012 novel \"Calico Joe,\"—detailing a fictional young player on the Cubs in the early 1970s—author John Grisham drew from Kessinger's memories. \"But Grisham gets the baseball right – among the people he consulted while writing the book was Don Kessinger, a longtime friend who was the Cubs' slick-fielding shortstop in the period the flashback portion covers.\"\n\nHis grandson Grae Kessinger is a minor league player.\n\n\n"}

His uncle was the biologist J.B.S. Haldane and his grandfather the physiologist John Scott Haldane. His younger brothers are the zoologists Avrion Mitchison and the late Murdoch Mitchison.\n\nIn 1954 Denis Mitchison's mother wrote the fantasy book \"Graeme and the Dragon\", in which the protagonist is her grandson, Denis's son Graeme Mitchison.\n\nHe was educated at the Dragon School, Oxford and Abbotsholme School, going on to Trinity College, Cambridge where he studied Natural Science obtaining a 1st class degree and a senior scholarship. He only then changed to Medicine, qualifying from University College in 1943, and chose postgraduate training in pathology.\n\nHis first job in Pathology was at the Brompton Hospital at the time that the first clinical trial with a randomised intake between treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) with streptomycin or with bed rest alone was run.\nMitchison then continued his lifelong interest in the treatment of TB participating in the clinical trials organised by the Medical Research Council's Tuberculosis Research Unit (MRC TRU) with Director Philip D'Arcy Hart.\n\nFollowing the decisive importance of drug-resistant tubercle bacilli in treatment, he was appointed in 1964 as Director of a new MRC Unit on Drug Resistance in Tuberculosis (later changed to MRC Unit for Laboratory Studies of Tuberculosis) at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School. He then worked closely with D'Arcy Hart at the MRC TRU and later with Wallace Fox, Director of the MRC Tuberculosis and Chest Diseases Research Unit on developing effective treatment for TB at a cost sufficiently low to be affordable in developing countries.\n\nThe framework of this work was a series of clinical trials in the UK and in larger numbers in East Africa, India, Hong Kong, Singapore and Czechoslovakia. This work passed through two stages; the first dealt with the problem of drug-resistant tubercle bacilli, which was solved by the use of regimens incorporating 2, 3 or 4 different anti-tuberculosis drugs. \n\nStarting with a publication in 1970, the second phase dealt with the shortening the treatment period from at least 12 months to 6 months by using rifampicin and pyrazinamide in so-called \"short-course\" regimens which have been the basis of current standard therapy with 2 months of 4 drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) followed by 4 months of rifampicin and isoniazid.\n\nHe established specialist TB laboratories in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia and a central laboratory in Hong Kong.\n\nHe published about 250 papers dealing with (1) factors slowing the growth of tubercle bacilli that might account for the lengthy duration of treatment, including the first paper on the effects of anaerobic culture; (2) with Jean Dickinson on post-antibiotic effects to account for the success of intermittent drug dosage; (3) the curious characteristics of attenuated South Indian strains of TB; (4) the response to treatment when the strains were initially resistant to the drugs allowing identification of the action of individual drugs.\n\nAfter his notional retirement in 1985, he continued working first at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith and then at St George's, University of London. He developed the technique of measuring the early bactericidal activity of drugs, which is now standard practice as the initial step in the phase II of clinical development of new drugs with Amina Jindani and colleagues in South Africa. He also introduced the concept of the 8-week phase II study with the proportion of patients obtaining negative sputum culture at 8 weeks, a standard assessment in most such studies. More recently he developed a new type of phase II 8-week study using modelling of counts of TB in sputum during treatment (with Geraint Davies and the South African MRC). He worked on several new anti-TB drugs and participated in clinical trials on high dosage rifamycins. \n\nMitchison finally stopped regular work at the age of 95.

It was released in 1996 in North America. It is part of the Advanced Daisenryaku (Advanced World War) series which was developed by Systemsoft and published by Sega.\n\n\"Iron Storm\" is a strategy game that takes place within the context of World War II. The game's general premise is to allow players to pick a side (United States, Nazi Germany, or Japan) and then work their way across several battles within the war. The game takes place in both the Pacific Theatre and European Theatres. In addition, if a player wins certain battles then the path of the war changes. For example, Nazi Germany winning the Battle of Britain will allow for an eventual invasion of America, as will Japan defeating the United States at the Battle of Midway.\n\nDuring battles in campaign mode, the player mobilizes a large variety of customizable units (tanks, aircraft, submarines, and warships) across a hexagon-shaped grid in order to defeat the opposing Allied or Axis forces controlled by the game's AI. In addition, as time progresses players can upgrade individual units either based on experience levels or as a blanket technology upgrade. Experimental weaponry is used in some later battles, including some German jet aircraft like the Messerschmitt Me 262. The map system itself is static, but real-time 3-D animations are used to recreate encounters between various types of units, an option that can also be toggled off.\n\nThe game's North American publisher, Working Designs, donated 50 cents of every copy sold to the National Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"Iron Storm\" was a minor hit in Japan.\n\nThe game was positively received by critics. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave the game an 8 out of 10, praising the ability to view the outcome of each battle in cinematic view and the use of experience points. A \"Next Generation\" critic found that the cinematic sequences at least initially dispel the perception of strategy games as \"dry\", and noted that they can be turned off once their novelty fades and they become simply a means of slowing down the gameplay. He was pleased that the gameplay is more straightforward and simple than other offerings in the genre such as \"P.T.O. II\", and found the game overall \"ranks with the best of its strategy companions.\" \"GamePro\"s Scary Larry also found the game more accessible than other war simulators. He complimented the ability to name the commander for each country, the numerous unit types, the sounds, and the brutal depiction of warfare. He called the game \"the best war sim to date ... and one of the most fun sims ever.\"\n\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" named \"Iron Storm\" a runner-up for Strategy Game of the Year (behind \"Dragon Force\").\n"}

It consists of a Chief Justice and six Associate Justices. The seven justices sit in Hartford, across the street from the Connecticut State Capitol. It generally holds eight sessions of two to three weeks per year, with one session each September through November and January through May. Justices are appointed by the governor and then approved by the Connecticut General Assembly.\n\nThe current Connecticut Supreme Court includes:\n\nJustices must retire upon reaching the age of 70. They may continue to hear cases as Judge Trial Referees in the Superior Court or the Appellate Court. Justices may assume Senior Status before attaining age 70 and continue to sit with the Supreme Court, as needed. Multiple justices have availed themselves of this option. For example, Justice Ellen Ash Peters took senior status in 1996, continuing to sit until 2000 and Justice Angelo Santaniello assumed senior status in 1987 and continued to sit as needed until 1994. Justice Armentano assumed senior status in 1983 but continued to sit with the Court as needed. Chief Justice Callahan assumed senior status in 1999 but served for approximately another year as a Senior Justice. Chief Justice Sullivan assumed senior status in 2006 but continued to sit until 2009. Justice Vertefeuille assumed senior status in 2010 but has remained active with the Court.\n\nIn the event of a recusal or absence, a judge of the Appellate or Superior Court may be called to sit with the Supreme Court. One of the most recent instances of a lower court judge being called to \"pinch-hit\" was Judge Thomas Bishop of the Appellate Court in \"Bysiewicz v. Dinardo\".Then-Appellate Court Judge Lubbie Harper (who later served as a Justice of the Supreme Court) also sat with the Supreme Court in the landmark case of \"Kerrigan v. Commissioner of Public Health\". Judge Francis X. Hennessy also frequently served by designation on the Court.\n\nNotable former justices include:\n\nThe Supreme Court of Connecticut was created in 1784. Prior to this, the power to review lower court rulings was vested in the General Assembly, which determined appeals by examining trial court records. Even after its creation, the Court was not completely independent of the executive and legislative branches, since its members included the Lieutenant Governor, members of the Council (or upper chamber of the General Assembly), and, in 1794, the Governor.\n\nIn 1806, the number of Superior Court judges was increased from five to nine and those judges, sitting together, constituted the Supreme Court, replacing the Governor, Lieutenant Governor and Council Members. The General Assembly, however, retained the power to overturn the court's rulings. Twelve years later, in 1818, the Connecticut Constitution established an independent judiciary, with the Supreme Court of Errors as the state's highest court. (The words \"of Errors\" were deleted in 1965). The creation of an independent judiciary established the third branch of government, which is responsible for interpreting the laws enacted by the legislative branch of government.\n\nIn 1982, in response to an overwhelming Supreme Court docket, Connecticut's voters approved a constitutional amendment creating the intermediate Connecticut Appellate Court.\n\nThe court's ruling on April 19, 1977 in \"Horton v. Meskill\" (172 Conn. 615) held that the right to education in Connecticut is so basic and fundamental that any intrusion on the right must be strictly scrutinized. The Court said that public school students are entitled to equal enjoyment of the right to education, and a system of school financing that relied on local property tax revenues without regard to disparities in town wealth and that lacked significant equalizing state support was unconstitutional. It could not pass the test of strict judicial scrutiny. The Court also held that the creation of a constitutional system for education financing is a job for the legislature and not the courts. Chief Justice House wrote the majority opinion. Justices Bogdanski, Longo, and Barber concurred in the decision, and Justice Bogdanski filed a concurring opinion. Justice Loiselle dissented from the majority opinion.\n\nThe Court (610 A.2d 1225), speaking through Justice Robert I. Berdon, delineated a six-factor test to assess claims of rights under the Connecticut Constitution. The six factors are:\n\nThis test has subsequently formed the underpinnings of subsequent decisions interpreting and guiding the meaning of the Connecticut Constitution, including that the Connecticut Constitution affords greater protections than its Federal counterpart—including the Kerrigan decision discussed below, and Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Educational Funding v. Rell. Chief Justice Ellen Ash Peters and Justice David Shea and Justice Robert Glass joined Justice Berdon's majority opinion. Justice Alfred Covello dissented.\n\n\"Sheff v. O'Neill\" is a landmark Connecticut Supreme Court decision (\"Sheff v. O'Neill\", 238 Conn. 1, 678 A.2d 1267) regarding civil rights and the right to education. On July 9, 1996, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that the state had an affirmative obligation to provide Connecticut's school children with a substantially equal educational opportunity and that this constitutionally guaranteed right encompasses the access to a public education which is not substantially and materially impaired by racial and ethnic isolation. This was a split 4–3 decision, which was authored by Chief Justice Ellen Ash Peters. Peters was joined in the majority opinion by Justices Robert Berdon, Flemming L. Norcott, Jr., and Joette Katz. Justice David M. Borden authored the dissent, with Justices Robert Callahan and Richard Palmer concurring.\n\nOne of the most important cases the court has decided was \"Kelo v. City of New London\" (2004), appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The state court sided with the city in a 4–3 decision, with the majority opinion authored by Justice Norcott and joined by Justices Borden, Palmer and Vertefeuille. Justice Zarella wrote an unusually lengthy and considered dissent (joined by Justices Sullivan and Katz), due to the importance of the case and the high likelihood that the United States Supreme Court would grant certiorari. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision in favor of the city, in a 5–4 decision, with the dissent written by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. The Kelo decision is studied as a continuation of the expansion of governments' power to seize property through eminent domain, although the widespread negative popular reaction has spurred a backlash in which many state legislatures have curtailed their eminent domain power.\n\nOn Monday, June 21, 2004, Gov. John G. Rowland announced his resignation amid allegations of graft and a movement to impeach him for accepting gifts. The resignation came several days after the Court ruled on June 18 that the state House Select Committee of Inquiry, which was weighing whether to impeach Rowland, could compel the governor to testify.\n\nThose joining the majority in this opinion (\"Office of the Governor v. Selected Committee of Inquiry to Recommend Whether Sufficient Grounds Exist for the House of Representatives to Impeach Governor John G. Rowland Pursuant to Article Ninth of the State Constitution\", SC 17211), included Justices Borden, Norcott, Katz, Palmer and Vertefeuille. In an extraordinary action, all five majority justices signed their names as authors of the opinion. Dissenting were Chief Justice Sullivan and Justice Zarella.\n\nOn October 10, 2008, the court ruled in \"Kerrigan v. Commissioner of Public Health\" that gay and lesbian couples could not be denied the right to marry because of the Equal Protection Clause of the state constitution. This decision made Connecticut the third state (along with Massachusetts and California) to legalize same-sex marriage through judicial decree of the state supreme court. Chief Justice Rogers, who did not participate in the decision, was replaced by appellate Judge Lubbie Harper, Jr. The majority opinion was written by Justice Palmer, and joined by Justices Norcott, Katz, and Judge Harper. Justices Zarella, Vertefeuille, and Borden dissented.\n\nIn \"George L. Rosado et al. v. Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corporation et al. (SC 17807)\", 292 Conn. 1 (2009) the majority opinion of the court, authored by Justice Katz, and joined by Chief Justice Rogers, and Justices Palmer and Vertefeuille, effectively ordered the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport to release thousands of legal documents from previous lawsuits filed against priests accused of sexually abusing children. A dissenting opinion was authored by Justice Sullivan. The Connecticut Supreme Court case stemmed from a suit brought by the \"Boston Globe\", \"Hartford Courant\", \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" in 2002. On October 5, 2009, the United States Supreme Court rejected a request by the diocese for the court to stay or reconsider the Connecticut opinion ordering the release of the documents. The documents were released at the Waterbury Superior Courthouse on December 1, 2009. The diocese has provided background and a statement on the suit and its status.\n\nIn \"State v. Santiago\", 318 Conn. 1, the Connecticut Supreme Court held that, after the state legislature had abolished capital punishment for prospective cases in 2012, imposition of the death penalty for already convicted and sentenced prisoners was unconstitutional under the Constitution of Connecticut as \"excessive and disproportionate punishment\". Justice Palmer authored the 4-3 majority opinion holding the death penalty as violating the state constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment while the dissenters (Chief Justice Rogers and Justices Zarella and Espinosa) charged the majority with substituting its own judgment for that of the legislature, which in 2012 had declined retrospective effect of Public Act 12-5 (P.A. 12-5), An Act Revising the Penalty for Capital Felonies.\n\nThe court became embroiled in a lengthy ethics scandal in 2006 when the \"Hartford Courant\" revealed that retiring Chief Justice William J. Sullivan postponed the publication of a controversial decision opposing Freedom of Information Act requests for documents that track the status and history of legal cases in the Connecticut legal system until hearings for his successor Justice Peter T. Zarella were completed. Legislators speculated Sullivan delayed the publication of the court's opinion because he feared it might damage Zarella's chances of becoming Chief Justice. Both justices ruled in favor of the restrictions. Governor M. Jodi Rell rescinded Zarella's nomination to be Chief Justice after the \"Courant's\" revelation.\n\nAfter the \"Hartford Courant\" reported Sullivan's actions, it was revealed that fellow justice David M. Borden was the person who came forward with the information. The incident caused a firestorm in the legislature and judiciary. Sullivan was referred to the Judicial Review Council, which suspended him for violating judicial ethics rules. Angry legislators led by Senator Andrew McDonald grilled Sullivan at an investigative hearing, where he repeatedly apologized for his actions.\n\nGov. Rell nominated Chase T. Rogers to the position of Chief Justice. Rogers had experience as an Appellate and Superior Court judge. After receiving a unanimous vote for confirmation from the General Assembly, she was sworn in as Chief Justice on April 25, 2007.\n\n\n\n"}
