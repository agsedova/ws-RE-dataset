Malka Spigel (bass, vocals), Samy Birnbach (vocals, lyrics) and Berry Sakharof (guitars, keyboards, vocals) left their native Tel-Aviv in 1981 for Amsterdam in search of an escape from the provincial attitudes of their own city. Of the trio, only Berry was a \"real\" musician. Malka was \"learning to play the bass\", while Samy was better known as a DJ (Morpheus) and a music fan who dabbled in poetry. They recorded a 2-song demo at home, and became one of the first artists signed to the Belgian Crammed label.\n\nDuring the recording for a speculative 7\" in a little studio in the Belgian countryside, it became quickly evident that the trio had hit upon something worthy of development and their first, self-titled, mini album \"Minimal Compact\" was the fruit of this. Their burgeoning style was a heavily Middle-Eastern coloured brand of post-new wave, based on driving rhythms, scratchy guitars and their own very un- \"Anglo-American\" style of vocalisation. In this way they both prefigured alternative dance and later fascinations with so called world music.\nThis mini-album (now re-released on CD along with its successor \"One by One\") features \"Statik Dancin' \" which remained a live staple throughout the band's career, and \"Creation Is Perfect\", based on a text by the beat poet Bob Kaufman.\n\n\"One by One\", the second album, was recorded in London in 1982, and like its predecessor co-produced by Dirk Polak (from Mecano (Dutch band)) and Crammed supremo Marc Hollander. It includes tracks such as \"Babylonian Tower\", \"Disguise\" (another live staple), \"It Takes a Lifetime\". With this release Minimal Compact had become a \"real band\" with the addition of the native Amsterdammer Max Franken on drums. Now Minimal could play live, this was to prove a strong element in their career. As Minimal began to tour more extensively they went from strength to strength as a live band.\n\n\"Deadly Weapons\", produced by Gilles Martin and Tuxedomoon's Peter Principle dates from 1984 and is considered by some their most experimental album. Nonetheless it threw up a \"club classic\" of the time in the shape of \"Next One Is Real\" (famously remixed by Dick O'Dell, one time boss of the Guerilla label). The sleeve was by Neville Brody.\nOn this album the \"classic\" 5-person line up became complete with the addition of guitarist/vocalist Rami Fortis a long time Minimal cohort from Tel Aviv who was arguably Israel's most innovative post-punk musician with his solo debut Plonter (knots). Fortis had previously collaborated with Malka on their \"7 codes\" tape (a low-fi home tape effort which had been sold in the indie shops in Amsterdam).\n\nTouring by this point took them further and further afield, everywhere from Palermo to Kyoto fell to their conquest, although British success was limited to an NME single of the week and a John Peel session.\n\n\"Raging Souls\" was released in 1985. Produced by Colin Newman, with artwork by Eno/Sylvian collaborator Russell Mills, it has proved their most popular album, with tracks like \"My Will\", \"When I Go\" (which was included in Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire movie soundtrack), \"The Traitor\", \"Autumn Leaves\" all of which became live favorites. By this time Minimal had become established in Brussels and were at the hub of the local \"International Indie Scene\" which featured at various times, Tuxedomoon (both individually and collectively), Bel Canto, Colin Newman, Sonoko, Gilles Martin and Benjamin Lew.\n\nAs a follow up Minimal Compact recorded a 12\" \"Immigrants Songs\" (featuring a Led Zeppelin cover) with Israeli Uri Barak. Like \"Next One Is Real\" before it the 12\" received extensive US college/dance attention and figures amongst their most enduring work.\n\n\"The Figure One Cuts\" was their last studio album, recorded in 1987 with producer John Fryer (Cocteau Twins, Depeche Mode, M/A/R/R/S). Tracks include \"Nil-Nil\"\", \"Inner Station\", \"New Clear Twist\", \"Piece of Green\". The \"Lowlands Flight\" instrumental album was released at the same time in Crammed's \"Made To Measure\" series. The touring continued but their goal of following up their record success in the USA was never achieved as several planned tours were cancelled because the US immigration authorities refused to grant them visas.\n\n\"Minimal Compact Live\" was recorded in 1987 in Rennes, France, this last album came out after the band split in '88.\n\nIn 2004, The band reformed briefly for a series of shows in Israel and a European tour. Crammed published a \"best of\" compilation and a box set containing unreleased material and remixes to coincide with the reunion. Berry & Fortis are currently collaborating under the name Fortisakharof, Malka & Max are in Githead & Samy continues to DJ and make music under the name DJ Morpheus.\n\nIn July 2008, the band reunited for series of live shows in Tel Aviv, Israel, starting on July 8, 2008, marking the 60th birthday of Samy Birnbach.\n\nOn November 12, 2011, it was announced that Minimal Compact would be reuniting for a short tour of five dates in Israel in January–February 2012. The band would perform in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, between January 25–February 2, 2012.\n\nOn August 12, 2012, it was announced that Minimal Compact would perform a live gig at Lodz, Poland in September 2012.\n\nOn November 8, 2015, it was announced that Minimal Compact would be reuniting for two dates in Israel in January 2016. The high demand caused the band to extend the short tour to four dates; the band would perform in Tel Aviv, between January 20-26, 2016.\n\nOn october 2019 the album \"Creation Is Perfect\" was released.\n\n\n\n"}

It includes advice from the \"Simpsons\" character Bart Simpson on how to deal with life. The book was written by several authors, and was helped into print by Matt Groening. It has received critical praise.\n\nThe book was published in 1993 by HarperCollins. The entire name of the book is \"Bart Simpson's Guide to Life: A Wee Handbook for the Perplexed\". It was written by numerous contributing authors: Peter Alexander, Jamie Angell, Ted Brock, Eileen Campion, Max Franke, Jim Jensen, Barbara McAdams, Bill Morrison, Mili Smythe, Mary Trainor, and Doug Whaley. \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening is credited with helping the book into print. Morrison, Dale Hendrickson, and John Adam are listed as the book's artists.\n\nThe main purpose of \"Bart Simpson's Guide to Life\" is to give supposedly helpful tips and advice on how to cope with life (including parents, peers, school, romance, health, and manners) as experienced by the fictional character Bart Simpson from the animated television series \"The Simpsons\". Although, as noted by Nancy Basile of About.com, \"one should be cautious when accepting advice from the child who spends much of his school time at the blackboard writing punishments.\" Phillip Slee wrote in \"Child, Adolescent and Family Development\" that the book provides a \"contemporary glimpse into the world of middle childhood\". Specific things taught to readers by Bart in the book include how to increase one's allowance, avoid chores in the home, and getting away with cheating in school. A nutritional manual by Bart is also included.\n\nNancy Basile of About.com gave \"Bart Simpson's Guide to Life\" a five out of five rating, commenting: \"This book is a banger. You'll get a lot of laughs for a lot less than other cartoon books. [...] If you're a Bart fan, you must own this book. If you're a fan of \"The Simpsons\", you'll love this book. If you're just getting to know our favorite family, you should pick up this book to enjoy some giggles at new jokes and Bart's past adventures. Every fan will love this book, the first, second and third time.\" Basile also praised the illustrations as \"hysterical\".\n\nMarch Rogers, writing for RTÉ.ie, was more negative. He wrote: \"The funny bit is Matt Groening's introduction, from there is falls away to the kind of humour written on the walls of bathrooms and the backs of copy books in primary school. It seems to be pitched in-between audiences — too adult for children, too childish for adults. Page after page of annoyingly laid out poorly written prose recommending everything from cool things to be when you grow up to questioning whether or not they have secret sauce in Heaven. This attempt to portray the Simpsons characters indicates both that they do not translate well to print and that whoever contributed to this book was not a writer on the show.\"\n\n\"Bart Simpson's Guide to Life\" was included on a list of \"30-plus actual books written by fictional TV characters\" by authors of \"The A.V. Club\". They wrote that because \"characters have developed and the show’s voice has changed, \"Bart’s Guide To Life\" is understandably a bit dated 17 years later (see the reference to \"Simpsons\" bootleg shirts), but like a lot of the books on this list, it’s a souvenir from a different pop-cultural age.\"\n\n"}

The seven were:\n\n\nHaving been accepted as missionaries by Hudson Taylor of the China Inland Mission the seven were scheduled to leave for China in early February 1885. Before leaving the seven held a farewell tour to spread the message across the country — it was during this tour that someone dubbed them \"The Cambridge Seven.\"\n\nFor the next month, the seven toured the University campuses of England and Scotland, holding meetings for the students. Queen Victoria was pleased to receive their booklet containing The Cambridge Seven's testimonies. The record of their departure is recorded in \"The Evangelisation of the World: A Missionary Band\". It became a national bestseller. Their influence extended to America where it led to the formation of Robert Wilder's Student Volunteer Movement.\n\nAll seven had become born-again Christians and were moved by their beliefs to go to China in 1885 to spread these beliefs and to help the local population; most remained in or connected to missionary work for the rest of their lives. They were greatly influenced by Taylor's book \"China's Spiritual Need and Claims\". After their acceptance into the China Inland Mission, the seven toured England and Scotland, preaching and appealing to their listeners to follow their example and follow Christ. Charles Studd's brother Kynaston helped the seven in their preparations for departure.\n\nThe conversion and example of the seven was one of the grand gestures of 19th-century missions, making them religious celebrities; as a result, their story was published as \"The Evangelisation of the World\" and was distributed to every YMCA and YWCA throughout the British Empire and the United States.\n\nThough their time together was brief, they helped catapult the China Inland Mission from obscurity to \"almost embarrassing prominence\", and their work helped to inspire many recruits for the CIM and other mission societies. In 1885, when the Seven first arrived in China, the CIM had 163 missionaries; this had doubled by 1890 and reached some 800 by 1900, which represented one-third of the entire Protestant missionary force.\n\nThe Cambridge Seven arrived in Shanghai on 18 March 1885 and engaged in a variety of ministries throughout China:\n\n"}

The museum includes the landmark Weems–Botts House on the corner of Duke Street and Cameron Street and the Weems–Botts Museum Annex, which houses the Lee Lansing Research Library and Archive, located at 3944 Cameron Street. Both buildings are located in Merchant Park. The park's bandstand commemorates William Grayson, one of Prince William County's most respected citizens and one of Virginia's first senators. The museum tour showcases the history of Dumfries, Virginia's oldest chartered town, and people associated with the house, including Mason Locke \"Parson\" Weems, and attorney Benjamin Botts.\n\nThe museum was restored in 1975 as part of a bicentennial U.S. restoration project. The museum is owned by the Town of Dumfries and operated by Historic Dumfries Virginia, Inc., a non-profit organization.\n\nThe house originally served as the vestry for the Quantico Church.\nThe house was purchased by Parson Weems, a native Marylander, in 1798. Weems was a clergyman who became an author and purveyor of books, which he would sell from the back of his jersey wagon. While traveling through Dumfries during one of his book-selling tours, Weems met Fanny Ewell, the daughter of Colonel Jesse Ewell, a wealthy tobacco planter with a warehouse business in Dumfries. They married in 1795.\n\nDuring his ownership of the house, Weems wrote an 80-page booklet that would influence the thoughts of Americans to this day entitled \"A History of the Life and Death, Virtues and Exploits of General George Washington.\" Weems published the first biography on George Washington and was the creator of the famous cherry tree story (\"I cannot tell a lie, I did it with my little hatchet\"). Weems also created the fable that Washington threw a silver dollar more than 300 feet across the Rappahannock River. He also wrote biographies on Benjamin Franklin, Francis Marion, and William Penn. Sometime after the death of his father-in-law in 1805, Weems moved his family into the Ewell family estate, Bel Air. \n\nWeems sold his shop in 1802 to an attorney named Benjamin Botts. Benjamin Botts used the building as his law office. Best remembered as one of the defense attorneys who successfully defended Aaron Burr during his infamous treason and conspiracy trial, Botts was a Dumfries native and rising star in Virginia's legal community. Botts was killed in the Richmond Theater fire on December 26, 1811.\nAfter passing through multiple ownerships, the Merchant family owned and lived in the house from 1869-1968. The property was restored and opened as a museum in 1975.\n\n"}

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 24, 2002. In the episode, Bart meets a retired Western star named Buck McCoy who soon becomes his idol. After McCoy shows the Simpsons some of his films, they help him revive his acting career.\n\nThe episode was directed by Bob Anderson and written by John Swartzwelder, who based the script on a story idea pitched by fellow \"Simpsons\" writer Ron Hauge. The episode features Dennis Weaver as the retired Western actor Buck McCoy, Frank Welker as the vicious dog, and Karl Wiedergott as an alcoholic resembling Walter Brennan.\n\nWhen it was first broadcast, \"The Lastest Gun in the West\" was seen by 5.9% of the American population between ages 18 and 49. It has garnered mixed reviews from critics.\n\nWhen a vicious dog chases Bart, he takes refuge in the garden of a house belonging to former Western actor Buck McCoy. After Buck shows Bart a trick to calm the dog, Bart starts to hero-worship him. Naturally, Homer learns about Bart's new idol and demands he worship him instead.\n\nTo help revive Buck's career, Bart lands him a job on Krusty the Clown's show. Buck gets drunk and makes a fool of himself on the air. Seeing how crushed Bart is, Marge and Homer help Buck overcome his alcoholism by cleaning his house and enrolling him in an Alcoholics Anonymous program. Despite making progress, Buck fails to restore Bart's hero-worship.\n\nWhen Homer sees a news report about a robbery at the Bank of Springfield, he convinces Buck to foil the robbery and become a hero. Buck subdues the bank robbers and again becomes a hero in Bart's eyes. After acknowledging everything Homer has done, Bart declares him a hero too. As the episode ends, Bart is again chased by the vicious dog.\n\n”The Lastest Gun in the West” was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Bob Anderson. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on February 24, 2002.\n\nThe idea for the episode was pitched by \"Simpsons\" writer Ron Hauge, who thought it would be interesting to see an episode in which Bart would run into a retired Western film star in the neighborhood and \"think he was the coolest guy in the world\", although the actor had seen better days. Hauge suggested that Swartzwelder, who is an avid Western fan, would be the appropriate writer for the episode. Swartzwelder also pitched the plot idea about the angry dog who chases Bart in the episode.\n\nThe design for Buck McCoy was primarily based on Dennis Weaver, who portrayed him in the episode, as well as aspects of other western actors such as Roy Rogers and John Wayne. McCoy's costume in the fictional television show \"McTrigger\" was based on the attire worn by the main character in real-life television series \"McCloud\". The design for the dog went through several different model changes until the \"Simpsons\" staff settled on the \"very angry bull-terrier design\" seen in the episode. A scene in the episode shows McCoy showcasing an array of films he starred in to the Simpson family through a movie projector. In order to achieve the strobe light effect done by the projector, the animators painted every other frame white and then blank.\n\nThe episode features American actor Dennis Weaver, famous for his role in the television show \"Gunsmoke\", in a guest role as the Western actor Buck McCoy. Al Jean, the show runner for the episode, stated in the DVD commentary that Weaver was very funny, a ”terrific guy”, and that it was an honor to meet him. Karl Wiedergott, an actor who usually fills in for unavailable male cast members during table reads for \"The Simpsons\" episodes, portrayed an alcoholic resembling Walter Brennan. The dog was played by voice artist Frank Welker.\n\nThe episode title, which is often wrongfully referred to as \"The Latest Gun In the West\", is a pun based on the term \"the fastest gun in the west\". A scene in the episode shows McCoy auditioning for a spot in the Krusty the Clown show. To showcase his skills, McCoy shoots a Krusty cardboard cutout in the crotch. The scene is a reference to an incident on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\", in which Ed Ames hit a mannequin in the crotch while demonstrating a tomahawk throw. Carson's quips during the incident are referenced in Krusty's line \"Ooh, right in the panhandle.\" Carson can also be seen in one of the clips before Krusty's show in the episode, along with poet Robert Frost. The inside of McCoy's house is loosely based on the inside of Will Rogers' house in Will Rogers State Historic Park. \"McTrigger\", the last TV series McCoy starred in, is a parody of the American television police drama \"McCloud\", in which Weaver played the lead; McCoy claims the series was eventually retooled into \"Room 222\". In one scene, Homer shows Bart a poster of himself dressed as Farrah Fawcett.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on February 24, 2002, \"The Lastest Gun In the West\", along with a rerun of \"Malcolm in the Middle\", put Fox in second place for the night among adults between ages 18 and 49. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode received a 5.9 rating, meaning it was seen by 5.9% of the population in said demographic. On August 24, 2010, the episode was released as part of \"The Simpsons: The Thirteenth Season\" DVD and Blu-ray set.\n\nFollowing its television broadcast, \"The Lastest Gun in the West\" received a lot of negative feedback from \"The Simpsons\" fans. \"The Simpsons\" staff — who, according to Jean, are susceptible to criticism — were surprised by the amount of scorn the fans showed towards the episode. Jean, who thought the episode was \"great\", stated in the DVD commentary for the episode that he \"[has] never been able to quite figure [why the fans disliked the episode] out\", and speculated that, since Westerns have not been popular since the 1960s, \"they [\"The Simpsons\" fans] just don't care about them at all.\"\n\nFollowing the home video release of the thirteenth season of \"The Simpsons\", reviews of \"The Lastest Gun in the West\" were mixed. \n\nOn the negative side, describing the episode as a \"clunker\", Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict stated that the episode is \"frightfully thin\" and criticized the premise as being \"lazy\". \n\nNate Boss of Project:Blu criticized the premise as well, writing that the episode was \"just a couple jokes thrown together\" rather than a complete story. \n\nWriting for Blu-ray.com, Casey Broadwater described the episode as being \"just plain dull\".\n\nHowever, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide praised the episode as \"offer[ing] good laughs\" and wrote that, while the episode was not \"brilliant\", it was overall \"an enjoyable experience.\" \n\nGiving the episode a positive review as well, Ron Martin of 411Mania described the episode as being \"easily one of the best of the season\". The weapons Snake and his men were using in the robbery were M41A Pulse Riffles from the 1986 movie \"Aliens\", but they were colored in black.\n\n"}

It first aired in the United States on the Fox network on March 10, 2002. In the episode, Grampa Simpson falls in love with Zelda, an old woman who has just moved into the senior home in which Grampa lives. However, Grampa is not the only one in the home who is infatuated with Zelda.\n\nThe episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Lance Kramer. The storyline was pitched by Vitti, who based it on an article about social status in senior homes. The episode features Olympia Dukakis as Zelda, and Bill Saluga as his television character Ray J. Johnson. The song \"Ode to Branson\", which was written by Vitti and composed by Alf Clausen, was submitted for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music And Lyrics in 2002, which it ultimately lost to a score from \"The Blue Planet\".\n\nThe episode begins with the Simpson family visiting Grampa Simpson after his retirement home mistakenly reports his death. An old woman named Zelda moves into his retirement home in place of the actual deceased resident. Grampa is determined to win her love over Zack, another resident who owns and drives a minivan. After renewing his driver's license, Grampa convinces Homer to let him borrow the car to romance her. Although he impresses Zelda, Homer and Marge think she is a hoochie and only likes Grampa because he can drive. After he crashes Homer's car in a drag race with a rival seniors gang, Homer becomes furious with Grampa and takes his keys away, forbidding him to drive ever again. Zelda informs Grampa that she got them tickets to a theater in Branson, Missouri, but when he tells her he does not have a car, she leaves with Zack and his minivan.\n\nGrampa steals Marge's car and takes Bart with him on the road to Branson to win back Zelda. When realizing that Grandpa and Bart are heading to Branson, Homer, Marge, Lisa, and Maggie take a bus there. At the theater, Grampa calls out to Zelda from on-stage, but then denounces her in front of everyone, who then chant to her a hoochie, forcing her to leave the stage. Grampa then reconciles with Homer.\n\n\"The Old Man and the Key\" was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Lance Kramer. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on March 10, 2002. The idea for the episode was pitched by Vitti, who was inspired by an article about senior homes. The article described senior homes as being a lot like high schools, in that there are popular and unpopular people, and that those who, for example, own a car are \"like kings\". Vitti suggested that the episode should be that \"Grampa's life [is] basically like that of a teenager\", with Homer acting as if he was Grampa's father. The Souvenir Jackitos, who challenge Grampa to a death race in the episode, were conceived from an observation by the writers. The writers argued that the only ones buying expensive trademarked jackets are old people who want to appear younger.\n\nA scene in the episode shows Grampa and Bart driving to Branson with Marge's car, listening to the radio. Because the scene consists entirely of auditive gags, the \"Simpsons\" staff had difficulty figuring out what to show visually during the scene. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Jean explained that these scenes “get a really big laugh at the table,” but are subsequently hard for the animators. The scene makes use of a repeated background, an animation technique made famous by Hanna-Barbera in order to cut budget.\n\nThe song \"Ode to Branson,\" which is performed by several \"washed-up\" celebrities, was composed by Alf Clausen and written by Vitti. Even though Vitti received sole credit for writing the song, parts of the lyrics were written by \"Simpsons\" writer Carolyn Omine, which were then revised by fellow writer Matt Selman. Selman was especially satisfied with the rhyme sung by Mr. T; he stated that whenever he feels down, he thinks of that rhyme and that it \"boosts [him] up inside.\" The episode features American actress Olympia Dukakis as Grampa's love interest Zelda. American comedian Bill Saluga also makes an appearance, as his television character Ray J. Johnson. The owner of the minivan is portrayed by series regular Hank Azaria, who imitated the voice of Clark Gable for the character.\n\nThe title of the episode itself is a reference of Ernest Hemingway's book \"The Old Man and the Sea\". At the beginning of the episode, Homer is excited about the start of the (original) XFL season, unaware that the \"X\" didn't stand for anything and that the league itself had folded after its sole season the previous year. A scene in the episode shows Grandpa wearing a zoot suit, a suit popular in the 1940s. When Grandpa and Zelda take off on one of their dates, three old men with long beards imitate ZZ Top as a short part of \"Sharp Dressed Man\" is played. Grandpa's interaction with the \"Souvenir Jackitos\" in Apu's store mirrors a scene in the 1961 musical film \"West Side Story\", with Grandpa and his friends taking the role of the Jets in the film, the \"Souvenir Jackitos\" as the Sharks, and Apu as Doc. The \"Death race\" on the other hand, is a reference to the 1955 drama film \"Rebel Without a Cause\". The abandoned aqueduct, in which the death race takes place, is based on the Los Angeles River.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on March 10, 2002, \"The Old Man and the Key\" received a 7.9 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 7.9 million viewers. The episode ranked 19 in the top 25 most watched television programs the week it aired. Later in 2002, \"Ode to Branson\" was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music And Lyrics, which it ultimately lost to a score from BBC's nature documentary \"The Blue Planet\". In 2007, the song was included on the soundtrack album \"\".\n\nFollowing the thirteenth season's release on DVD and Blu-ray, \"The Old Man and the Key\" received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nWriting for Project:Blu, Nate Boss stated that Grampa \"just isn't all that funny when cornered, and that's what we get here,\" and that \"the jokes are a bit too few and far between\". Giving the episode a negative review, Ryan Keefer of DVD Talk wrote that it was \"borderline painful\" and one of the season's \"duds\". Casey Broadwater of Blu-ray.com wrote that the episode \"moves at a geriatric pace\", and R. L. Shaffer of IGN stated that it \"represent[s] some of the worst of \"The Simpsons\".\" On the other hand, giving the episode a positive review, Ron Martin of 411Mania enjoyed the \"poke towards Branson, Missouri, a mecca for old people everywhere,\" and Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B rating. Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide wrote that, even though Grampa is \"essentially a one-joke personality,\" \"those gags tend to be pretty fun.\" He concluded his review by writing that the episode was \"a likable program.\"\n\nDespite the mixed responses, the episode features one of the \"most used little clips\" of the series. The scene shows Grampa getting his driver's license. Instead of taking a photo for the license on the spot, Grampa suggests that Selma, who works in the facility, use a photo of him from a newspaper headline that reads \"Old man yells at cloud.\" Selma agrees, and Grampa, holding his newly acquired license, goes up to a window and yells \"Who's laughing now?\" at a cloud. A still from the scene has been used several times on \"The Daily Show\". Both Malkowski of DVD Verdict and Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide considered it to be the best part of the episode. After Clint Eastwood's speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, which featured Eastwood talking to an empty chair representing President Barack Obama, a modified version of the image with the caption, \"Old man yells at chair\", was used in an internet meme.\n\n"}

The group was formed in 2004 by identical twin sisters Lisa and Jessica Origliasso.\n\nIn 2005, the Veronicas released their debut studio album, titled \"The Secret Life of...\" which peaked at number two on the Australian Album Chart and was certified 4× platinum by Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for selling over 280,000 copies. The album spawned five singles, led by \"4ever\", three of which were top ten singles in Australia. In 2007, the duo released their second studio album, \"Hook Me Up\", which also peaked at number two in Australia and was certified 2× platinum for selling over 140,000 copies. The album garnered four Australian top ten singles. The album's title track, \"Hook Me Up\", was the Veronicas' first number one single in Australia, while \"Untouched\" was an international top ten hit.\n\nFollowing a lengthy hiatus (broken only by the July 2012 release of the Australian top forty single, \"Lolita\" and various gigs for their fans), in September 2014, the Veronicas released \"You Ruin Me\", the first single from their self-titled third studio album. The song debuted at number one on the ARIA Charts, becoming the girls' second chart topping single and their first to debut in the top spot. It also charted in United States and United Kingdom. The album was released both physically and digitally on 21 November 2014. In 2016, they hosted the ARIA Music Awards.\n\nIn 2001, the identical twins Lisa and Jessica Origlasso made their first demonstration recordings with Brisbane producer Stuart Stuart at Analog Heart Records. Stuart produced an EP in a more electronic style and, a year later, a second batch of songs in the pop rock style that the group initially became known for.\n\nIn 2004, the sisters, who were then performing as \"The Twins\" (and who were being managed by their father Joseph Origliasso at that time), were introduced by Gabrielle McKinley to Robin Donald Smith. Smith was a former operatic tenor who had performed overseas with the Sadlers Well Opera and at the Sydney Opera House with the Australian Opera, who owned the recording and music publishing company Multiplay Music Australia. After meeting Joseph and auditioning Lisa and Jessica, Multiplay Music Australia offered to sign The Twins to their first recording and music publishing agreements.\n\nAfter signing the Twins, the following year Smith and Bell, funded by Multiplay Music Australia, took the Twins on several world-wide songwriting trips to Britain, Sweden, Canada and the US in order for them to collaborate with top songwriters in each country to further develop their songwriting skills. These included Clif Magness (who has written with Avril Lavigne), Billy Steinberg (Madonna, Cyndi Lauper), Max Martin (Britney Spears, Katy Perry, P!nk), Eric Nova, Dead Mono and Vince DeGiorgio, where they created a catalogue of over 50 songs.\n\nMultiplay also secured introductions and auditions for them with numerous recording companies, including Sony, EMI, Universal, BMG and Warner Music.\n\nOn their return to Australia, Smith and Bell met with the executives at Engine Room (a subsidiary of PBL (Packer) Group). Throughout the year Multiplay then negotiated with Engine Room to contract the Twins to secure a recording contracts with Warner Music.\n\nMeetings were then arranged with Warner Bros. Records in the US. Seymour Stein and senior executives recognised that Smith and Bell had discovered and developed a musical talent, signing them quickly to a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records/Sire America, for a reported sum of two million dollars.\n\nRegarding how they chose their name, Jess Origliasso stated: \"The name is something we thought about for a short time and we wanted it to be a girl's name, but we didn't want it to be 'the Jesses.' We were very conscious of not wanting to make it a twin thing, because we don't think that's really cool.\"\n\n\"We didn't want it to be called 'the Lisas,' either,\" singer Lisa Origliasso added. \"So one day we saw the movie \"Heathers\", and there's a line where Christian Slater asks, 'Are you a Heather?' and Winona Ryder's character [Veronica] answers, 'No, I'm a Veronica,' and so we went with that, because she was this kind of cool, unique chick with an attitude.\"\n\nWhen it learned about the group, Archie Comics launched legal action against the group for trademark infringement in relation to popular character Veronica Lodge – who is also known for being a female character with an attitude – in an attempt to stop them from using the name. Archie Comics had asked Warner Music Group to hand over all publicity rights and to pay US$200 million in damages. Of this amount, $20 million was for damages and $180 million as a penalty against Warner. In a statement with \"The New York Times\" Michael I. Silberkleit, chairman of Archie Comics Publications, Inc. stated,\n\n\"The importance is the image of Archie, which everybody knows is good, clean, wholesome stuff ... Preventing unauthorized use of the name will protect both the characters and customers who have paid for licensing rights[...]\"\nA settlement was reached that included a cross-promotion deal, including an appearance in an issue of Veronica's series. The issue (\"Veronica #167\", released on 1 March 2006) featured the Veronicas in the feature story, \"What's In A Name?\", in which they meet Lodge, perform in Riverdale and spend a day there, as well as a card with a code allowing a free download of their single \"4ever\" in MP3 form. A few months later, \"Archie and Friends\" (No. 100) featured the Archies meeting the Veronicas. The next issue of \"Archie and Friends\" (No. 101) also featured the Veronicas, with Archie as their biggest fan.\n\nThe Veronicas performed at the 2005 NRL Grand Final days before their debut album, titled \"The Secret Life of...\", was released in Australia on 17 October 2005, entering the ARIA Album charts at the position of No. 7. Since then, it has peaked at No. 2 and gone 4x Platinum. Due to the success of the album, five singles were released in Australia: \"4ever\", \"Everything I'm Not\", \"When It All Falls Apart\", \"Revolution\" and \"Leave Me Alone\".\n\"The Secret Life of The Veronicas\" spent a year in the ARIA album charts without leaving the Top 40. In September 2006, the album was nominated for three ARIA awards including; \"Best Pop Release\", \"Highest Selling Album\" and \"Best Breakthrough Album\". They won \"Best Pop Release\" but lost the other two to other nominees. The girls also performed their 2nd single \"Everything I'm Not\" on the night.\n\nThe album was released in the US on 14 February 2006; it debuted at No. 133 on \"Billboard\" 200 and No. 3 on the \"Billboard\" Top Heatseekers chart. Only two singles were released in the United States off the album. A special DVD was released with the US version as a limited edition exclusive.

Other releases in the US include \"Sessions@AOL\" which features their songs \"Heavily Broken\" and \"Revolution\" live in the AOL studios, also released was \"\" which also features live performances of their songs including a new song, titled \"Stay\".\n\nThe album has also had success in other countries such as New Zealand where it debuted at No. 5, No. 75 on the Dutch Album Charts and No. 11 in Belgium. Due to their chart success in Belgium, they won the award for Best International New Artist at the TMF Awards of 2006. \"When It All Falls Apart\" spent a record of 17 weeks of MTV Asia's Pop 10 Chart, in which 7 of them were at the number 1 spot. The song was recorded in Simlish and is featured in the \"Sims 2\" expansion pack Seasons.\n\nLisa and Jessica are the faces of Choice Calvin Klein and Australian hair product company nu:u. \"Blender\" magazine included them in their list of hottest women in rock in 2006. The sisters sang the title song on the short-lived television show \"Related\" which had featured songs from their debut album. They appeared in an episode that aired 6 February 2006. In March 2006, their debut single \"4ever\" was featured in the Amanda Bynes comedy \"She's the Man\". It was featured in the promotional television spots, the film itself and the soundtrack. Their song \"Revolution\" appeared in another Amanda Bynes film, \"Sydney White\", in 2007.\n\nThe girls also appeared on \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\" episode \"The Suite Life Goes Hollywood\" as guest stars and performed their song \"Cry\". The twins have also created a fashion line called \"The Veronicas for Target\" which was released in stores on 25 August 2007 in Australia.\n\nOn 2 December 2006, The Veronicas released a CD/DVD, titled \"Exposed... the Secret Life of The Veronicas\" in Australia which features live performances from their Australian 2006 Revolution Tour and a DVD featuring parts of the sisters' live performances throughout 2005–2006, including footage that had previously not been seen, and their music videos.

The son of an immigrant French family, he preached, taught, and wrote in French. A founding member of the Berlin Academy, he wrote thousands of letters, popularized scientific and philosophical ideas, and also contributed to Diderot's \"Encyclopédie\".\n\nFormey was born in Berlin, Brandenburg, as the son of immigrant Huguenots. His mother died when he was three years old, and Samuel was brought up by two of his aunts. He was educated for the ministry, and at the age of twenty became pastor of the French Protestant church at Brandenburg. Having in 1736 accepted the invitation of a congregation in Berlin, he was in the following year chosen professor of rhetoric in the Collège Français there, and in 1739 professor of philosophy. His pupils included Louis de Beausobre, who was to become a philosopher and political economist of some standing in his own right.\n\nOn the reorganisation of the Academy of Berlin in 1744, during Frederick the Great's reign, Formey was named a member, and in 1748 its perpetual secretary.\nThe language between the scientists of the Academy, Latin, was changed into French. In 1750 he was appointed as a member of the Royal Society.\n\nBetween 1741 and 1753, successive publishers in The Hague brought out the six volumes of Formey's \"La belle Wolfienne\", which was his effort to explain the philosophy of Christian Wolff to women. This series began as a popularisation of Wolff's philosophy in the form of a philosophical romance, but by the end of the 4th volume, Formey abandoned fiction for a paraphrase and abridgement of Wolff's metaphysical works. These books made Wolff more known in France.\n\nFormey wrote during his life more than 17,000 letters, and corresponded several years with Francesco Algarotti, who in 1737 had published a book on Newtonianism for ladies.\"L'Anti-Sans-Souci, où la folie des Nouveaux philosophes\" (1760), which denied Frederick's authorship of the \"Oeuvres\" and stressed the king's piety is attributed to Formey, who did write the preface.\n\nFormey's principal works are \"La belle Wolfienne\" (1741–1753); \"Le Philosophe chrétien\" (1740); \"L'Emile chrétien\" (1764), intended as an answer to the \"Emile\" of Rousseau; and \"Souvenirs d'un citoyen\" (Berlin, 1789). He also published an immense number of contemporary memoirs in the transactions of the Berlin Academy. His correspondence with Prosper Marchand was published in 2012.\n\nAn extensive and detailed list of Formey's works can be found in .\n\n"}

His younger brother William Milford Teulon (1823–1900) also became an architect.\n\nHe was articled to George Legg, and later worked as an assistant to the Bermondsey-based architect George Porter. He also studied in the drawing schools of the Royal Academy. He set up his own independent practice in 1838, and in 1840 won the competition to design some almshouses for the Dyers' Company at Ball's Pond, Islington. After this his practice expanded rapidly. During the next few years his works mainly consisted of parish schools, parsonages and similar buildings, mostly in the Home Counties.\n\nHe was a friend of George Gilbert Scott and became a member of the Council of the Royal Institute of British Architects on 6 January 1835. Between 1841 and 1842 he undertook a long study tour of continental Europe with Ewan Christian who remained a lifelong friend and became his executor. Also in company during the tour was Horace Jones who was later knighted and became architect to the Corporation of the City of London and Hayter Lewis, later Professor of Architecture at University College, London.\n\nHe built his first church, the Early English-style St Paul, Bermondsey, in 1846. Soon after this he designed St Stephen, Southwark, a building adapted to its square site by being planned in the form of a Greek cross, with the recessed angles filled in by the tower, vestry, chancel aisles. \nTeulon's religious views were Low Church, and his patrons were predominantly members of established aristocratic families who shared his outlook. In 1848 he received a commission from the 7th Duke of Bedford to design cottages for the Thorney estate, and the next year he built Tortworth Court, Gloucestershire, a substantial mansion in a kind of Neo-Tudor style, with a large central tower, for the Earl of Ducie. Other clients included John Sumner, archbishop of Canterbury, who commissioned Christ Church in Croydon; the Duke of Marlborough, for whom he refitted the chapel at Blenheim Palace in 1857-9; the 10th Duke of St Albans and Prince Albert.\n\nHis work included the remodelling of several unfashionable 18th-century churches to suit contemporary tastes. Archibald Tait, the Bishop of London, praised his alterations at St. Mary's, Ealing, as \"the transformation of a Georgian monstrosity into the semblance of a Byzantine Basilica\".\n\nAs well as Gothic Revival churches, he designed several country houses and even complete villages, as he did at Hunstanworth in County Durham in 1863.\n\nDespite his classical training, Teulon's early designs were mostly in imitation of Tudor and Elizabethan styles, and he soon became an enthusiastic follower of the latest developments of the Gothic Revival. He was an enthusiastic user of Polychrome brickwork. His planning was often elaborate: Henry-Russell Hitchcock called his mansion at Elvetham Park in Hampshire \"so complex in its composition and so varied in its detailing that it quite defies description\". Some of his later work was, however, more restrained: for instance at St Stephen's Church, Rosslyn Hill, Hampstead, (1869–76) the exterior is of purple-brown brick, of subtly varied tones with light stone trimming. The massing of the building is also simpler than in his earlier designs.\n\nTeulon died at his home in Hampstead on 2 May 1873 and was buried in Highgate Cemetery. His great great great nephew, Alan Teulon, published a book on S.S. Teulon in \n2009. He was survived by four sons and four daughters.\n\n\n"}

Pinnaroo is on the north side of the Mallee Highway, and on the railway line between Tailem Bend and Ouyen. The roadhouse on the highway at Pinnaroo is the first \"food and leg-stretch\" stop on the bus route from Adelaide to Sydney. At the 2016 census, the locality of Pinnaroo had a population of 712 of which 547 lived in and around its town centre.\n\nThe town's name is derived from a word for \"big man\" in a local Aboriginal language. The railway arrived in the area in 1906. There had not been any significant development in the area before that, as the remoteness and difficulty of getting supplies in and produce out had made it uneconomic to farm before that.\n\nThe railway is not currently available for transport between the states, as the line from Tailem Bend was converted to standard gauge soon after the main Adelaide–Melbourne line was converted, but the line to Ouyen remains as broad gauge. Both sides are used to transport grain from silos along the railway line towards the ports in each state. The town has become a major centre for growing potatoes since around 1990.\n\nPinnaroo hosts the 'Pinnaroo SpudFest' each year. The SpudFest features a black tie dinner, stalls and games, entertainment, and 'spud wrestling'. Pinnaroo also has a show and field days every year at the start of October. The Pinnaroo Show features dog trials, agricultural tents, competitions, horse events, keg tosses, animal judging and fireworks. The show attracts over 10,000 people each year.\n\nThe Peebinga Conservation Park is 42 km north of Pinnaroo, Karte Conservation Park 30 km north-west, and the much larger Ngarkat Conservation Park is 28 km south of the town.\n\nThe town has a large variety of sports, such as Australian rules football, netball, cricket, tennis, basketball, volleyball, lawn bowls, badminton, golf and darts. The local football team, the Pinnaroo Supa Roos play in the Mallee Football League.\n\nPinnaroo is the seat of the local government area of the Southern Mallee District Council, and is in the state electoral district of Chaffey and the federal division of Barker.\n\n\"The Border Times\" is a weekly newspaper published in the town since 1911.\n\nPinnaroo Primary School is a public primary school for students in Reception to Year 7, and has approximately 80 students. The school has four composite classes - Reception, Years 1 and 2, Years 3 and 4, and Years 5,6 and 7. It is the only school within 30 km of the town. The school's slogan is \"Aim High\". The school is home to South Australia's first community library, which opened in 1977.\n\nThe school regularly takes part in interschool sports with neighbouring schools, Lameroo and Geranium, in swimming and athletics. The school also takes part in SAPSASA with the Murray Mallee team in sports such as Australian rules football, cricket, athletics, swimming, golf, softball, tennis, netball and basketball. The school has four classrooms, a GP room, an art and technical centre, a home economics centre, an FM radio station, a swimming pool, two ovals, outdoor tennis, netball and basketball courts, and a full-size gymnasium.\n\nPinnaroo is home to the Mallee Tourist and Heritage Centre, which apart from displays on local farming history, has well-maintained and presented collections relative to three distinct topics: history of wheat breeding (featuring the D. A. Wurfel grain collection); an extensive range of restored farm machinery, based on the Gum Family Collection, which includes a replica Ridley stripper; and letterpress printing. The museum, which is supported by the Pinnaroo Historical Society, is situated opposite the large and popular bakery.\n\n"}

The band was founded by guitarist Lester Flatt and banjo player Earl Scruggs and is viewed by music historians as one of the premier bluegrass groups in the history of the genre. The band was originally formed in 1948 by Flatt, who had been a member of Bill Monroe's bluegrass band. Flatt brought Scruggs with him shortly after leaving Monroe.\n\nFlatt and Scruggs and The Foggy Mountain Boys (in various forms and line-ups) recorded and performed together until 1969. The Foggy Mountain Boys are seen as one of the landmark bands in bluegrass music. Although it featured various casts, during the years of \"The Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs Grand Ole Opry Show\", notably sponsored by grain and flour producer Martha White, the band showcased fiddle player Paul Warren, a master player in both the old-time and bluegrass fiddling styles, whose technique reflected all qualitative aspects of 'the bluegrass breakdown' and fast bowing style; dobro player Uncle Josh Graves, an innovator of the advanced playing style of the instrument now used in the genre, stand-up bass player Cousin Jake Tullock, and mandolinist Curly Seckler.\n\nLester Flatt worked for Monroe at the time Earl Scruggs was considered for Bill Monroe's band, the Blue Grass Boys, in 1945. The two left that band early in 1948, and within a few months had formed the Foggy Mountain Boys. Flatt's rhythm guitar style and vocals and Scruggs' banjo style gave them a distinctive sound that won them many fans. In 1955, they became members of the Grand Ole Opry. Many of the songs on their albums are credited to \"Certain and Stacey\". These songs were in fact written by Flatt, Scruggs, and various other members of the Foggy Mountain Boys. Certain and Stacey are the maiden names of the wives of Flatt and Scruggs (Louise Certain, wife of Earl Scruggs, and Gladys Stacey, wife of Lester Flatt).\n\nScruggs, who had always shown progressive tendencies, experimented on duets with saxophonist King Curtis and added songs by the likes of Bob Dylan to the group's repertoire. Flatt, a traditionalist, did not like these changes, and the group broke up in 1969. Following the breakup, Lester Flatt founded the Nashville Grass and Scruggs led the Earl Scruggs Revue. Flatt died in 1979, at the age of 64. Flatt and Scruggs were elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1985.\n\nIn 2003, they ranked No. 24 on CMT's \"40 Greatest Men of Country Music\", one of only four non-solo artists to make the list (The Eagles, Alabama, and Brooks & Dunn are the others).\n\nScruggs died from natural causes on March 28, 2012 in a Nashville hospital.\n\n\n"}

The notice in the city's \"Herald\" newspaper described the estate as consisting of upwards of 15 acres, with a mansion house containing 2 dwellings and gardens well stocked with fruit trees.\n\nContemporary maps from the 1850s show the old house renamed as \"Mount Florida, (Ruin)\". It was entered from Prospecthill Road and consisted of two semi-detached dwellings and surrounding gardens.\n\nMuch of the present suburb is situated in the area to the south of the old house. This ground was part of the \"Lands of Clincart\", which were put up for sale by auction on 28 June 1836. A farmhouse and 95 acres of land were offered for potential residential development.\n\nMount Florida is served by the Mount Florida railway station which lies upon the Cathcart Circle railway line. The area is home to Langside College and the newly developed NHS Victoria hospital on the fringe of Queen's Park, which opened in 2009. Primarily a residential area, Mount Florida's housing stock largely comprises traditional tenemental buildings with the addition of two of Glasgow's high rise structures (Battlefield Court and Langside Court), which dominated much of the 1960s housing regeneration in the city. The main road through the area is Cathcart Road, a major route through Glasgow's south side. \n\nScotland's National Stadium, Hampden Park, is located off Cathcart Road in the heart of Mount Florida. The 51,866 seater stadium is home to the Scottish Football Association, and Scottish Football League Third Division club team Queen's Park. The stadium has also played host to numerous large music events and was the track events stadium for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Mount Florida is also home to numerous lawn bowling clubs, including Glasgow's Indoor Centre. The local green area of Cathkin Park was home of the now defunct football club, Third Lanark.\n\nMount Florida is in the Langside ward for Glasgow City Council and since May 2012 is represented by Councillors Archie Graham, Susan Aitken and Liam Hainey. Mount Florida lies within the Glasgow Cathcart Scottish Parliamentary constituency. The sitting MSP is James Dornan. Mount Florida is in the Glasgow South UK Parliament constituency, and the sitting MP is Stewart McDonald.\n\nAs part of the system of local democratic representation there is an active community council. \n\nCreation Records founder Alan McGee and Primal Scream vocalist Bobby Gillespie both grew up in Mount Florida and attended Kings Park Secondary School in nearby Simshill.

They are designated as \"MSO\" (Mine Sweeper Ocean), distinguishing them from the smaller coastal MSCs and inshore MSIs. Besides the US Navy, this class of vessels has also been used by the Belgian Navy and the Norwegian Navy, among others.\n\nMinesweeping, or the disposal of naval mines, by these vessels is performed in different ways:\n\nOf the 53 constructed for the United States Navy, 10 were built at Higgins Corp., New Orleans, Louisiana, 9 at J.M.

This practice was dangerous not only from the risk of missing and detonating a mine, but also because the enemy would be making the task harder for the sweepers by keeping them under constant, heavy fire. Minesweepers were greatly admired by their peers because of their bravery.\n\n\"Aggressive\"-class minesweepers used AN/SQQ-14 mine hunting sonar to locate moored or bottom mines. They used electromagnetic cables to set off mines or other cables to cut their mooring lines, and various magnetic and acoustical devices to set off mines. Toward the end of their use, the class also employed remote submersibles like Super Sea Rover to locate mines.\n\nToday, active minesweepers or minehunters are frequently used. The Royal Navy of the United Kingdom uses small submarines that are controlled by wireless operators on board the several minesweeping frigates that it possesses. Sweden produced a robotic Self-propelled Acoustic/Magnetic Minesweeper (SAM), which proved its worth during Operation Desert Storm, when it was successfully used for minesweeping by the US Navy. SAMs are currently in service with the Swedish Navy, the Japanese Navy, the Royal Navy and the US Navy, though not necessarily aboard \"Aggressive\"-class minesweepers.\n\n\n"}

Engel, directed by Lloyd Bacon, that stars Richard Widmark, Dana Andrews, and Gary Merrill. The film's storyline is based on operations by United States Navy Underwater Demolition Teams, popularly known as \"frogmen\", against the Japanese Army and naval forces. It was the first such film about scuba diving and became a popular cultural hit.\n\nFollowing the opening credits, \"The Frogmen\" has an on-screen written statement:\n\n\"This is a true story based on incidents which occurred in the latter part of World War II. It deals with one of the most hazardous and unique branches of the Armed Forces ... the Underwater Demolition Teams. This film could not have been produced without the active cooperation of the Department of Defense and the United States Navy\".\n\nUnderwater Demolition Teams have been used since World War II for reconnaissance duties, clearing underwater obstacles planted by the enemy, advance landings on beaches, and offensive underwater attacks on enemy ships; they were the forerunners of the Navy SEALs.\n\nDuring World War II, Navy Lt. Cmdr. John Lawrence (Richard Widmark), a strict disciplinarian, is put in charge of Underwater Demolition Team 4 after its former leader, Lt. Cmdr. Jack Cassidy, is killed in action. The unit's men are distrustful of the professionally aloof Lawrence, and the relationship immediately takes a turn for the worse when they brawl with sailors aboard their transport ship. The ship's captain, Lt. Cmdr. Pete Vincent (Gary Merrill), understands the natural resentment the elite UDT men feel over the death of Cassidy, which they have transferred to Lawrence, and offers to go easy on the team at captain's mast. The \"by-the-book\" Lawrence, however, elects to hold his own mast and disciplines the entire team just before a dangerous reconnaissance mission to ascertain the safest landing beach during an upcoming invasion of a Japanese-held island. Lawrence is scornfully perceived as afraid when he splits up the platoon and puts team executive officer Lt. Klinger in charge of a diversion to the more dangerous beach, where the main landing is scheduled.\n\nDuring the mission, Lawrence cuts his leg on coral, and the diversionary section's pick-up boat receives a direct hit from artillery during pick-up operations, killing Klinger and most of his men. Lawrence sees that two frogmen, including Chief Jake Flannigan (Dana Andrews), are still in the water, but rather than risk loss of the information already gathered, orders a rescue boat launched and continues back to the transport. The rescue succeeds in recovering the two swimmers, but Lawrence's apparently cowardly action increases the unit's ill will toward him. An embittered Flannigan and some of the others request transfer to another unit, but Lawrence insists that they first complete the next day's mission to clear the new landing site for the invasion.\n\nThe next morning, Lawrence, who is sick with coral poisoning, does not reveal his illness when he puts Flannigan in charge of the mission and stays behind. Convinced now that Lawrence is a coward, the men angrily but efficiently complete their task, although \"Pappy\" Creighton (Jeffrey Hunter), whose brother is a U.S. Marine, sneaks onto the beach with Flannigan to leave a sign \"welcoming\" the Marines. Creighton is shot after the prank, but Flannigan tows him to the pick-up boat. Back on the ship, Creighton is put in traction because of the bullets in his spine, and Flannigan confesses to Lawrence that the prank caused Creighton's injuries. Lawrence furiously upbraids Flannigan for giving in to the prank, and soon all of the men request transfers.\n\nWhile Lawrence is discussing the transfer requests with Vincent, a torpedo hits the ship but does not detonate. Lawrence volunteers to disarm the torpedo, which has lodged in the sick bay next to Creighton's bed, and with Flannigan's help, succeeds. Soon after, Lawrence receives orders to blow up a Japanese submarine pen, and tells the men that although it will be their last mission together, he is proud to have served with them. Although Flannigan voices disdain that Lawrence will again dodge dangerous duty, Lawrence leads the mission, which is discovered when one of the men accidentally trips a signal wire. Japanese sentries shoot at the men as they plant the charges, and Lawrence is stabbed in hand-to-hand combat with a Japanese diver. He orders Flannigan to leave him behind, but Flannigan tows him to safety. The mission is a success, and soon Lawrence is recuperating beside Creighton. Finally won over by Lawrence's bravery, the men show their acceptance of him by asking him to sign the portrait they have drawn of Cassidy to present to his widow.\n\n\nProducer Paul Short of Allied Artists protested the use of the title \"The Frogmen\" by Twentieth Century-Fox, asserting that he had established prior claim to it. Eventually, Short dropped his claim and Twentieth Century-Fox was allowed to use the title. Short's production was never made. Several major studios were interested in producing films about the Underwater Demolition Teams, but only Twentieth Century-Fox obtained an exclusive guarantee of cooperation from the U.S. Navy.\n\nHenry Hathaway, one of the studio's most well received directors, was originally set to direct the film, which was to feature Millard Mitchell in a starring role. Richard Conte was also originally set to play \"Pete Vincent\", while Jack Elam was first cast as \"Sleepy\", and Craig Hill was set to play \"Lt. J. G. Franklin\". Assistant director Dick Mayberry briefly filled in for director Lloyd Bacon when Bacon fell ill with influenza.\n\nProducer Sam Engel wrote an original story, titled \"Frogmen in Korea\", as an intended follow-up to \"The Frogmen\", but the project soon dissolved. A one-hour television remake of \"The Frogmen\", titled \"Deep Water\", was broadcast in May 1957 on the \"20th Century-Fox Hour\". The program was directed by Roy Del Ruth and starred Ralph Meeker (Lawrence), James Whitmore (Flannigan), and Richard Arlen (Vincent).\n\nBecause working conditions for \"The Frogmen\" were deemed too \"riotous\" for women, all female roles were written out of the screenplay and none appeared in the completed film. Jack Warden makes an uncredited appearance in the beginning of the film as a crew member of the transport ship. Co-star Gary Merrill, in the role of the captain of UDT-4's transport ship, delivers the line of dialog, \"Looks like you've got what amounts to a legal mutiny on your hands\", that is virtually identical to a line that he spoke three years earlier in the World War II Army Air Force drama \"Twelve O'Clock High\".\n\nThe filming of the submarine sequence took place on the deck of USS \"Kleinsmith\" (APD-134) while the ship was off Key West, FL on 11 January 1951. Much of the boat and high-speed transport scenes were shot between 15 January and 6 February 1951 from the deck of \"Kleinsmith\", while the ship was off St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. USS \"Taconic\" (AGC-17) appeared as the command ship. As spoken in dialog, the submarine's name sounds like \"USS Jackass 259\", but is actually \"USS Jack SS-259\". The real USS \"Jack\" (SS-259) was not actually used in the film, as it was out of commission at the time.\n\nMany United States Navy SEALs have cited this film as their inspiration for joining the SEAL Teams, including Richard Marcinko (the first Commanding Officer of SEAL Team Six and Red Cell), the Medal of Honor recipient Michael E. Thornton, and Dennis Chalker.\n\n"}
{"id": "2240281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2240281", "title": "Frank McAvennie", "text": "Frank McAvennie\n\nFrancis McAvennie (born 22 November 1959) is a Scottish former footballer, who played as a striker for St Mirren, West Ham United and Celtic, having had two spells with each of these clubs. With Celtic he won the Scottish Premier Division in 1987–88 and the Scottish Cup in 1988. He was capped five times at senior level for Scotland during the 1980s, scoring one goal.\n\nBorn in Glasgow, Scotland, McAvennie grew up in Milton and attended St. Augustine's School also in Milton.\n\nMcAvennie started his playing career in Scottish Junior League football. In 1979 during an amateur game with a local side, the 200 Club, in Kirkintilloch, McAvennie, playing well, came to the attention of local scouts. He was recommended to local junior side Johnstone Burgh signing for them for a £500 fee. He completed a trial for Partick Thistle playing in a single game where he was sent on as a substitute only to be substituted off in the same game and be told by manager Bertie Auld that he would never make a career in the game of football. Before turning professional, he had joined the Territorial Army and later had trials with the British Army but was not accepted for a role with them due to his inability to hit the target during shooting practices. He also had a spell working as a road sweeper. He did not move into professional football until he joined St Mirren in 1980, at the age of 20. His league debut came in the 1981-82 season in a 4-3 defeat of Airdrieonians. Playing as a Midfielder, McAvennie scored two goals. In 1982, he was named Scottish PFA Young Player of the Year. He would make 135 league appearances for them over the next five years, scoring 48 goals.\n\nHis strong form in Scotland attracted attention from south of the border and McAvennie had talks with Luton Town and their manager, David Pleat, in the summer of 1985. With talks progressing well McAvennie decided not to sign for Luton due to the attitude of their chairman, David Evans. With St Mirren then agreeing a fee with West Ham United, McAvennie met with their manager John Lyall and his staff and he signed for them in June 1985 for £340,000. He made his West Ham debut on 17 August 1985, the opening game of the season, in a 1-0 away defeat to Birmingham City with his first two goals coming in his second game, a 3-1 home defeat of Queens Park Rangers. Originally signed as an attacking midfielder he was played as an out-and-out striker after an injury to Paul Goddard in the opening game of the season. He would go on to keep Goddard out of the team and spark his transfer from the club the following season.\nIn his first season, he helped West Ham to their highest ever final position in English football when they came third. His 26 goals in the league was only bettered by Gary Lineker, who found the net 30 times for second-placed Everton.\n\nAt this time McAvennie's success on the pitch came to the attention of TV producers. He appeared on the BBC's Wogan show, hosted by Terry Wogan, an event which McAvennie claims changed his life and introduced him to a celebrity lifestyle. He is quoted as saying \"\"Then I signed for West Ham and money and girls were thrown at me and, hey, who was I to say no? Then I went on Wogan and it really took off. I was never under any illusions why it was happening. It wisnae because of my looks, it was because I was a footballer\".\"\nWest Ham were denied UEFA Cup action for the following season due to the ban on English clubs in European competitions, which had started a year earlier due to the Heysel disaster.\nThe following season was less successful as they finished 15th as McAvennie scored just seven league goals from 36 games and eleven from 47 games in all competitions. He began the 1987-88 season still at West Ham.\n\nMcAvennie played eight games for the \"Hammers\" at the start of 1987–88, failing to score, before he moved to Celtic for a then club record fee of £750,000 on 2 October 1987. Graeme Souness had approached him to join rival club Rangers at the 1986 FIFA World Cup which would have made him the first Catholic player to play for the Protestant club, but he refused, being a supporter of Celtic. He made his debut for Celtic the following day in a 1–1 draw at home against Hibernian.\n\nMcAvennie made a slow start at Celtic and his progress was not helped when he got involved in an on-field fracas with Chris Woods, Terry Butcher and Graham Roberts in an Old Firm game in November 1987. McAvennie and Woods were sent off in the initial incident, whilst Butcher was sent off later in the game. All four were later reported to the Procurator Fiscal and appeared in court on disorder charges relating to their conduct in that game. McAvennie was found not guilty, Roberts not proven, whilst Butcher and Woods were both convicted of Breach of the Peace.\n\nMcAvennie eventually found his form at Parkhead, and his 15 goals in 1987–88 helped Celtic to a Scottish Premier Division and Scottish Cup double. That season (the clubs's Centenary Season), he was part of a formidable front trio for Celtic comprising himself, Andy Walker and Joe Miller. One of the high-points during the season for McAvennie were his two goals in Celtic's 2–0 win over Rangers in January 1988. The Cup Final in May was particularly memorable for McAvennie as he scored two late goals to beat Dundee United 2–1, the winning goal coming in the final minute.\n\nThe following season, 1988–89, was not a happy one for Celtic and the team finished in third place in the league behind winners Rangers and second-placed Aberdeen. McAvennie, however, was one of Celtic's few form players that season and he'd scored 11 goals by Christmas time. However, a broken arm sustained in the New Year game at Ibrox against Rangers curtailed his goalscoring. McAvennie also wished to return to London to enable him to spend more time with then girlfriend, glamour model Jenny Blyth. After a public row with manager Billy McNeill over being dropped for a league match at Tynecastle in March 1989 against Hearts, Celtic relented to McAvennie's repeated requests for a transfer and sold him back to West Ham.\n\nMcAvennie returned to West Ham United in March 1989 in a £1.25 million deal, making him their record signing. His weekly wages were £2,200, his highest ever weekly wage as a footballer. According to Celtic manager Billy McNeill's autobiography, McAvennie wanted to return to London and his model girlfriend Jenny Blyth. McAvennie claims in his autobiography that Celtic were refusing to pay him a signing-on fee. Just before his return to Boleyn Ground, Celtic had accepted an offer from title chasing Arsenal, whose manager George Graham was looking for a proven goalscorer to partner Alan Smith. However, McAvennie turned down the chance to join Arsenal and accepted John Lyall's offer shortly afterwards. While Arsenal went on to dramatically win the First Division title on the last day of the season, West Ham were relegated to the Second Division and McAvennie failed to score a single goal in the remaining nine games of the season. He has since admitted that his decision to join West Ham and not Arsenal was based on his love of the club and not on the likelihood of footballing success.\n\nHis second spell in London was not as successful as his previous one. Now playing in the Second Division, things got worse for both McAvennie and West Ham when the striker suffered a broken leg on the opening game of the season on 19 August 1989, following a challenge by Stoke City's Chris Kamara, which put him out until March 1990. He made his return on 31 March 1990 against Port Vale. By this time West Ham were 10th in the league and ultimately finished in 7th place missing out on the playoffs.\n\nIn the aftermath of his injury, it was alleged in the tabloid press that McAvennie had threatened legal action against Kamara. This did not materialise and McAvennie has stated he had no intention of litigation. Kamara's view was that his challenge was innocuous and perfectly good and that McAvennie has created \"many lies and false recollections\" concerning the tackle. McAvennie recalls in his autobiography, \"Scoring, An Expert's Guide\", that Kamara had \"come straight through him, crumpling him to the ground\" and had then stood over him saying \"Get up you Scottish bastard, this is a man's game\". The tackle resulted in a broken leg, shattered ankle and torn ligaments for McAvennie who had two plates and a bolt inserted in his ankle and another plate in his leg. Incensed by the tackle some supporters of West Ham sent death threats to Kamara. Out injured, on pain-killers and with spare-time on his hands McAvennie visited London's nightclubs to take his mind off his injuries and the boredom of not playing football. At these venues he was introduced to cocaine to which he became addicted.\n\nMcAvennie recovered from injury for the 1990–91 season. His first goal in his second spell for West Ham and his first since April 1987 game on 29 August 1990 in a 1-1 home game against Portsmouth; the second game of the season. West Ham won promotion from the Second Division and reached the 1990-91 FA Cup semi-finals. He played 34 league games and scored 10 goals, now partnering Trevor Morley up front (his previous West Ham strike partner Tony Cottee had departed to Everton in August 1988).\n\nThe 1991-92 season was a poor one for both West Ham and McAvennie. He scored only three league goals in the first half of the season with West Ham never out of the bottom three after December 1991. He also faced competition for a regular place from new signing Mike Small. On 2 May 1992, he signed off in style at West Ham, scoring a hat-trick in his final match against Nottingham Forest having come on as a substitute for Mitchell Thomas. West Ham had already been relegated in 22nd and bottom place. His tally in a frustrating season for both the player and the club was just six goals from 20 league games.\n\nMcAvennie then accepted an offer from Ron Atkinson to sign for Aston Villa on a free transfer, but played just three games in the new Premier League, as the partnership of Dalian Atkinson and early season signing Dean Saunders saw Villa emerge as title challengers. Villa finally finished runners-up to Manchester United. McAvennie did not score for Villa. He left in January 1993 to rejoin Celtic.\n\nMcAvennie played one game for Irish League club Cliftonville in 1992, scoring in a County Antrim Shield semi-final. McAvennie was then offered a contract with Hong-Kong side South China. Despite being well received by the local fans and management, he found the standard of football to be unchallenging and he returned to the United Kingdom.\n\nOn hearing of his exit from Hong Kong, John Lambie agreed terms with McAvennie to sign for Partick Thistle. Although a press conference to announce the signing was arranged at Firhill Stadium, Celtic manager, Liam Brady, hearing he was available, persuaded him to sign for his former club which he did in January 1993.\nHe scored nine goals in 19 league games that season, though Celtic could only manage a third-place finish as Rangers secured their fifth successive title.\n\nIn 1993–94, McAvennie managed just 11 league appearances, scoring once, as he lost his place in the team following Liam Brady's departure and the appointment of Lou Macari as manager. In February 1994, Macari loaned McAvennie to English Premier League strugglers Swindon Town, and he made just seven league appearances and failed to score as \"the Robins\" were relegated in bottom place at the end the 1993-94 season in which they managed only five wins and conceded 100 goals. A highlight of his spell at the County Ground came on 19 March 1994 when he helped \"the Robins\" hold league leaders (and eventual double winners) Manchester United to a 2–2 draw.\n\nHe then left Celtic for a second time and signed for Falkirk, newly promoted to the Scottish Premier Division for 1994–95, and scoring twice in three games before dropping down a division and returning to St Mirren on a free transfer on 14 October 1994. He played seven games for St Mirren that season, failing to score, before retiring as a player at the age of 35. In a professional career which had stretched for 15 years, he managed a total of 136 goals in the English and Scottish leagues, combined with many more in the cups and also in Europe for Celtic.\n\nMcAvennie was called into the Scotland national team late 1985 for the World Cup qualifying play-off with Australia at Hampden Park on 20 November. Following a 58th-minute goal by Davie Cooper, McAvennie scored in the 60th minute on what was his international debut. The game finished 2–0 to Scotland. In the return leg in Melbourne on 4 December 1985, which was McAvennie's 2nd international appearance, the game finished 0-0 resulting in Scotland qualifying for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. Having travelled with Scotland to Australia he returned to the UK and only three days later scored the only goal for West Ham in a 1-0 win at Loftus Road against Queens Park Rangers.\n\nHe was subsequently called up to the Scotland national team for the 1986 World Cup, under interim national coach Alex Ferguson. He made two appearances in the World Cup in Mexico, both as a substitute and both defeats, to Denmark and to West Germany. In total he won five caps for Scotland, the last against Saudi Arabia in February 1988 in a 2–2 draw in Riyadh.\n\nDuring his playing career he reputedly enjoyed a playboy lifestyle involving drink, drugs and womanising. His lifestyle was the inspiration for a parody character played by Jonathan Watson in the Scottish comedy TV programme, Only an Excuse?\n\nIn 2000, having been cleared in court of an incident involving the supply of controlled drugs, McAvennie found himself in severe financial difficulties and resorted to selling his medals to Celtic-supporting businessman Willie Haughey for a small sum; these were later returned to him in 2017.\n\nOn 12 January 2009, McAvennie received a four-month suspended sentence for affray following an incident in July 2008 in which he head-butted a man in Douglas on the Isle of Man.\n\n\n"}

Part of the Columbia Valley sub-region of the East Kootenay region, it is a tourist destination known for its rolling cliffs and views of the Rocky Mountains. It is privately owned by Panorama Mountain Village Inc.\n\nPanorama was founded in 1962 by Fritz Zehnder of Invermere and Guy Messerli of Switzerland, and some friends. The original facilities consisted of a warming hut, parking lot, and single rope tow, running on a V8, which ran transported users up the bottom of a ski run now known as \"Old Timer\". The area took its name from a nearby hiking area called the \"Panorama Plateau\". \n\nIn 1964, a platter, purchased from nearby Sunshine Village, was installed to replace the rope tow. During these initial years, the ski hill was volunteer-run.\n\nIn 1968, 12 local businessmen formed a group called Panorama Ski Hill Company Ltd to manage and grow the ski hill. A lodge, built in an A-Frame style, was built. In 1969, several slopes were cleared, the platter was moved to its present location as the current Silver Platter, and a mile-long wooden T-Bar was installed along the route of the current Mile 1 Express.\n\nIn the early 70s, Panorama Ski Hill Company continued to grow and required more area to accommodate more skiers. To raise capital for expansion, utilities were installed for 75 lots, which were sold near the base of the hill for development to raise money for the hill. Using the funds that they earned from the lots, a new double chair, named the \"Horizon Chair\", was installed. in 1975. The Horizon ran roughly three quarters along the path of the current current Champagne Express lift.\n\nIn 1978, Panorama was purchased from Panorama Ski Hill Company by Calgary based Alan Graham and Cascade Development Group. With more available capital, Graham funded more facilities at the base of the hill the construction of the Toby Creek Lodge, in 1979, the Horsethief Lodge, Pine Inn, and tennis facilities, in 1982, and a conference centre in 1985. They expanded the ski hill, with the construction of the current Toby and Sunbird Chairs in 1980, snowmaking facilities in 1983, and Champagne T-Bar in 1984. The T-Bar was built, in part, to facilitate hosting the World Cup in 1985. In 1988, the original wooden T-Bar was replaced by the current Mile 1 Express quad chair.\n\nIn 1993, the hill was purchased by Intrawest. Intrawest brought fresh capital to the ski hill. A T-Bar was constructed to the summit immediately, opening up 200 acres of double black diamond terrain called the \"Extreme Dream Zone\". In 1997, Intrawest unveiled a master plan for the development of the resort, which included expansion of snowmaking, skiable area, the base village, and construction of the current Greywolf Golf Course. That year, the original A-Frame lodge was replaced. In 1999, a \"pulse gondola\", was installed a for use as a people mover. In 2001, in bounds backcountry style terrain was added, named Taynton Bowl. In 2003, the Horizon double chair and Champagne T-Bar were replaced by the Champagne Express, and the Summit T-Bar was replaced by the Summit Quad. In 2008, the Audi FIS Alpine Ski World Cup returned to the resort with Giant Slalom and Slalom. Over the years, various real estate developments and accommodation facilities were added to the village.\n\nIn 2010, while Intrawest was under risk of foreclosure, a group of local private investors, called Panorama Mountain Village Inc, purchased Panorama Mountain Resort from Intrawest. In December 2014, the resort opened the Discovery Quad. The new chair goes from the learning area to the top of Stringer, a green run. It makes for a very natural and easy learning progression for people transferring from the carpet lifts to the chair lift. In 2017 and 2019, new terrain was added in the Taynton Bowl area, currently serviced by a 13 passenger snowcat called \"Monster X\".\n\nIn the Panorama Master Plan, there are plans to have another lift built in the Taynton Bowl area, and two additional lifts in and around the Sun Bowl area, named Hopeful Creek and Sun Bowl chairs.\n\nThe ski resort is of above average size for North America, with of skiable lift-served terrain. This places it somewhere in the top ten in terms of area. It also has one of the largest vertical drops in North America, at . In terms of continuously skiable vertical drop, with it is 5th behind Revelstoke, Whistler Blackcomb, Jackson Hole, and Kicking Horse.\n\nAt the bottom of the ski hill there is a resort with lodging, restaurants, retail shops, and the Panorama Springs Pools complex. There is also the Panorama Nordic Centre with approximately 20.5 km of trail for classic and skating and 6.6 km for classic only. Approximately 4 km from the Nordic center there is the Hale Hut.\n\nIt is also home to Greywolf golf course, which winds along the Toby Creek Canyon.\n\nThe only way to access Panorama is via a road from the town of Invermere, located approximately away.\n\n"}

It roughly states that if formula_1 is small, then formula_2 can be contained in a small generalized arithmetic progression.\n\nIf formula_2 is a finite subset of formula_4 with formula_5, then formula_2 is contained in a generalized arithmetic progression of dimension at most formula_7 and size at most formula_8, where formula_7 and formula_10 are constants depending only on formula_11.\n\nFor a finite set formula_2 of integers, it is always true that\n\nwith equality precisely when formula_2 is an arithmetic progression.\n\nMore generally, suppose formula_2 is a subset of a finite proper generalized arithmetic progression formula_16 of dimension formula_17 such that formula_18 for some real formula_19. Then formula_20, so that\n\nThis result is due to Gregory Freiman (1964,1966). Much interest in it, and applications, stemmed from a new proof by Imre Z. Ruzsa (1994). Mei-Chu Chang proved new polynomial estimates for the size of arithmetic progressions arising in the theorem in 2002.\n\nThe proof presented here follows the proof in Yufei Zhao's lecture notes.\n\nThe Ruzsa covering lemma states the following:\n\nThis lemma provides a bound on how many copies of formula_31 one needs to cover formula_2, hence the name. The proof is essentially a greedy algorithm:\n\nProof: Let formula_27 be a maximal subset of formula_2 such that the sets formula_35 for formula_2 are all disjoint. Then formula_37, and also formula_38, so formula_39. Furthermore, for any formula_40, there is some formula_41 such that formula_35 intersects formula_43, as otherwise adding formula_44 to formula_27 contradicts the maximality of formula_27. Thus formula_47, so formula_30.\n\nLet formula_49 be a positive integer, and formula_50 and formula_51 be abelian groups. Let formula_52 and formula_53. A map formula_54 is a Freiman formula_55-homomorphism if\nwhenever formula_57 for any formula_58.\n\nIf in addition formula_59 is a bijection and formula_60 is a Freiman formula_55-homomorphism, then formula_59 is a Freiman formula_55-isomorphism.\n\nIf formula_59 is a Freiman formula_55-homomorphism, then formula_59 is a Freiman formula_67-homomorphism for any positive integer formula_67 such that formula_69.\n\nThen the Ruzsa modeling lemma states the following:\n\nThe last statement means there exists some Freiman formula_55-homomorphism between the two subsets.\n\nProof sketch: Choose a prime formula_81 sufficiently large such that the modulo-formula_81 reduction map formula_83 is a Freiman formula_55-isomorphism from formula_2 to its image in formula_86. Let formula_87 be the lifting map that takes each member of formula_86 to its unique representative in formula_89. For nonzero formula_90, let formula_91 be the multiplication by formula_92 map, which is a Freiman formula_55-isomorphism. Let formula_94 be the image formula_95. Choose a suitable subset formula_96 of formula_94 with cardinality at least formula_98 such that the restriction of formula_99 to formula_96 is a Freiman formula_55-isomorphism onto its image, and let formula_102 be the preimage of formula_96 under formula_104. Then the restriction of formula_105 to formula_74 is a Freiman formula_55-isomorphism onto its image formula_108. Lastly, there exists some choice of nonzero formula_92 such that the restriction of the modulo-formula_72 reduction formula_111 to formula_108 is a Freiman formula_55-isomorphism onto its image. The result follows after composing this map with the earlier Freiman formula_55-isomorphism.\n\nThough Freiman's theorem applies to sets of integers, the Ruzsa modeling lemma allows one to model sets of integers as subsets of finite cyclic groups. So it is useful to first work in the setting of a finite field, and then generalize results to the integers. The following lemma was proved by Bogolyubov:\n\nGeneralizing this lemma to arbitrary cyclic groups requires an analogous notion to “subspace”: that of the Bohr set. Let formula_120 be a subset of formula_79 where formula_72 is a prime. The Bohr set of dimension formula_123 and width formula_124 is \n\nwhere formula_126 is the distance from formula_127 to the nearest integer. The following lemma generalizes Bogolyubov's lemma:\n\nHere the dimension of a Bohr set is analogous to the codimension of a set in formula_118. The proof of the lemma involves Fourier-analytic methods. The following proposition relates Bohr sets back to generalized arithmetic progressions, eventually leading to the proof of Freiman's theorem.\n\nThe proof of this proposition uses Minkowski's theorem, a fundamental result in geometry of numbers.\n\nBy the Plünnecke-Ruzsa inequality, formula_141. By Bertrand's postulate, there exists a prime formula_72 such that formula_143. By the Ruzsa modeling lemma, there exists a subset formula_74 of formula_2 of cardinality at least formula_146 such that formula_74 is Freiman 8-isomorphic to a subset formula_148.\n\nBy the generalization of Bogolyubov's lemma, formula_149 contains a proper generalized arithmetic progression of dimension formula_17 at most formula_151 and size at least formula_152. Because formula_74 and formula_94 are Freiman 8-isomorphic, formula_155 and formula_149 are Freiman 2-isomorphic. Then the image under the 2-isomorphism of the proper generalized arithmetic progression in formula_149 is a proper generalized arithmetic progression in formula_158 called formula_16.\n\nBut formula_160, since formula_161. Thus \nso by the Ruzsa covering lemma formula_163 for some formula_164 of cardinality at most formula_165. Then formula_166 is contained in a generalized arithmetic progression of dimension formula_167 and size at most formula_168, completing the proof.\n\nThe current best bounds on formula_7 and formula_10 were provided by Tom Sanders, who showed that one can take\n\nA result due to Ben Green and Imre Ruzsa generalized Freiman's theorem to arbitrary abelian groups. They used an analogous notion to generalized arithmetic progressions, which they called coset progressions. A coset progression of an abelian group formula_173 is a set formula_174 for a proper generalized arithmetic progression formula_16 and a subgroup formula_176 of formula_173. The dimension of this coset progression is defined to be the dimension of formula_16, and its size is defined to be the cardinality of the whole set. Green and Ruzsa showed the following:\n\nGreen and Ruzsa provided upper bounds of formula_189 and formula_190 for some absolute constant formula_191.\n\nTerence Tao (2010) also generalized Freiman's theorem to solvable groups of bounded derived length.\n\nExtending Freiman’s theorem to an arbitrary nonabelian group is still open.

Fermionic fields obey canonical anticommutation relations rather than the canonical commutation relations of bosonic fields.\n\nThe most prominent example of a fermionic field is the Dirac field, which describes fermions with spin-1/2: electrons, protons, quarks, etc. The Dirac field can be described as either a 4-component spinor or as a pair of 2-component Weyl spinors. Spin-1/2 Majorana fermions, such as the hypothetical neutralino, can be described as either a dependent 4-component Majorana spinor or a single 2-component Weyl spinor. It is not known whether the neutrino is a Majorana fermion or a Dirac fermion; observing neutrinoless double-beta decay experimentally would settle this question.\n\nFree (non-interacting) fermionic fields obey canonical anticommutation relations; i.e., involve the anticommutators {\"a\", \"b\"} = \"ab\" + \"ba\", rather than the commutators [\"a\", \"b\"] = \"ab\" − \"ba\" of bosonic or standard quantum mechanics. Those relations also hold for interacting fermionic fields in the interaction picture, where the fields evolve in time as if free and the effects of the interaction are encoded in the evolution of the states.\n\nIt is these anticommutation relations that imply Fermi–Dirac statistics for the field quanta. They also result in the Pauli exclusion principle: two fermionic particles cannot occupy the same state at the same time.\n\nThe prominent example of a spin-1/2 fermion field is the Dirac field (named after Paul Dirac), and denoted by formula_1. The equation of motion for a free spin 1/2 particle is the Dirac equation,\n\nwhere formula_3 are gamma matrices and formula_4 is the mass. The simplest possible solutions to this equation are plane wave solutions, formula_5 and formula_6. These plane wave solutions form a basis for the Fourier components of formula_1, allowing for the general expansion of the wave function as follows,\n\n\"u\" and \"v\" are spinors, labelled by spin, \"s\". For the electron, a spin 1/2 particle, \"s\" = +1/2 or s=−1/2. The energy factor is the result of having a Lorentz invariant integration measure. In second quantization, formula_1 is promoted to an operator, so the coefficients of its Fourier modes must be operators too. Hence, formula_10 and formula_11 are operators. The properties of these operators can be discerned from the properties of the field. formula_1 and formula_13 obey the anticommutation relations:\n\nwhere \"a\" and \"b\" are spinor indices. We impose an anticommutator relation (as opposed to a commutation relation as we do for the bosonic field) in order to make the operators compatible with Fermi–Dirac statistics. By putting in the expansions for formula_1 and formula_16, the anticommutation relations for the coefficients can be computed.\n\nIn a manner analogous to non-relativistic annihilation and creation operators and their commutators, these algebras lead to the physical interpretation that formula_18 creates a fermion of momentum p and spin s, and formula_19 creates an antifermion of momentum q and spin \"r\". The general field formula_1 is now seen to be a weighted (by the energy factor) summation over all possible spins and momenta for creating fermions and antifermions. Its conjugate field, formula_21, is the opposite, a weighted summation over all possible spins and momenta for annihilating fermions and antifermions.\n\nWith the field modes understood and the conjugate field defined, it is possible to construct Lorentz invariant quantities for fermionic fields. The simplest is the quantity formula_22. This makes the reason for the choice of formula_23clear. This is because the general Lorentz transform on formula_24 is not unitary so the quantity formula_25 would not be invariant under such transforms, so the inclusion of formula_26 is to correct for this. The other possible non-zero Lorentz invariant quantity, up to an overall conjugation, constructible from the fermionic fields is formula_27.\n\nSince linear combinations of these quantities are also Lorentz invariant, this leads naturally to the Lagrangian density for the Dirac field by the requirement that the Euler–Lagrange equation of the system recover the Dirac equation.\n\nSuch an expression has its indices suppressed. When reintroduced the full expression is\n\nThe Hamiltonian (energy) density can also be constructed by first defining the momentum canonically conjugate to formula_1, called formula_31\n\nWith that definition of formula_33, the Hamiltonian density is:\n\nwhere formula_35 is the standard gradient of the space-like coordinates, and formula_36 is a vector of the space-like formula_37 matrices. It is surprising that the Hamiltonian density doesn't depend on the time derivative of formula_24, directly, but the expression is correct.\n\nGiven the expression for formula_1 we can construct the Feynman propagator for the fermion field:\n\nwe define the time-ordered product for fermions with a minus sign due to their anticommuting nature\n\nPlugging our plane wave expansion for the fermion field into the above equation yields:\n\nwhere we have employed the Feynman slash notation. This result makes sense since the factor\n\nis just the inverse of the operator acting on formula_1 in the Dirac equation. Note that the Feynman propagator for the Klein–Gordon field has this same property. Since all reasonable observables (such as energy, charge, particle number, etc.) are built out of an even number of fermion fields, the commutation relation vanishes between any two observables at spacetime points outside the light cone. As we know from elementary quantum mechanics two simultaneously commuting observables can be measured simultaneously. We have therefore correctly implemented Lorentz invariance for the Dirac field, and preserved causality.\n\nMore complicated field theories involving interactions (such as Yukawa theory, or quantum electrodynamics) can be analyzed too, by various perturbative and non-perturbative methods.\n\nDirac fields are an important ingredient of the Standard Model.\n\n\n"}

Jakob, was a German-Swedish businessman and one of the pioneers in the history of Sweden's Jewish population, which began to take root around the turn of the 18th-19th centuries.\n\nMarcus was probably born in 1749 in Schwaan, Germany. Marcus's considerable impact on the history of Norrköping and his significance to immigration and advancement have been pointed out in several publications. He had that city's first synagogue built, which opened in 1796 for the increasing community centered on its congregation.\n\nThat and his general benefit to Sweden, as a merchant especially privileged by King Gustav III, and his position as an East Gothland property owner and community leader, have been recorded in published biographical articles.\n\nMarcus died 13 March 1819 in Norrköping, Sweden.\n\nTwo of Marcus's daughters, Lowisa (1787-1842) and Hedda (1796-1834) married two brothers of the successful von Reis family of Gothenburg Jews.\n\nA number of famous Swedes have descended from Marcus and his wife Fredrika Isaksdotter (1760-1826, originally \"Freideh Isaac\"), such as historian Hugo Valentin, TV producer Gunilla Marcus-Luboff, the Bonnier publishing dynasty, opera star Isa Quensel, industrialist Stefan Anderson, photographer Mattias Klum, pop entertainer Magnus Uggla. Usually, already the early descendants of Marcus and Isaksdotter married into Swedish families which were not Jewish. American botanist-author Siri von Reis in New York and daughter Serena Altschul also descend from Marcus.\n\nIn 1900, a comprehensive account of the entire Marcus family and its descendants was published in Sweden as a large printed circular chart, and an extensive family roster was updated until 1942 by Curt Marcus. Beginning around that time, Jewish descent (no matter how diluted) was kept in low profile, especially during World War II, despite Sweden's neutrality.\n"}

Naysmith moved to England to sign with Premier League club Everton, where he stayed for seven seasons. Naysmith was capped 46 times by the Scotland national team between 2000 and 2009. After spells with Sheffield United and Huddersfield Town, Naysmith returned to Scotland with Aberdeen.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Naysmith signed with part-time club East Fife, and was appointed the player-manager in December. He managed Scottish Championship club Queen of the South from December 2016 to May 2019.\n\nNaysmith started his senior career with Hearts, whom he joined from local side Whitehill's Colts team. Naysmith made his professional debut, aged only 17, several months later in a League Cup tie with Celtic. His opportunity arose from a suspension crisis, the Maroons having no fewer than four defenders (Bruno, Weir, Ritchie and Pointon) sent off in their previous match at Rangers. Despite the patchwork nature of their defence, Hearts defeated Celtic 1–0, with Naysmith earning plaudits for his mature display. Within a year he had established himself as the side's first-choice left back, displacing Neil Pointon, and in 1998 helped the Tynecastle club end their 36-year trophy drought by lifting the Scottish Cup. That season he was also named Scottish PFA Young Player of the Year.\n\nA transitional season followed as the loss of Weir, McCann (both transferred) and Colin Cameron (injured) destabilised the side. Naysmith himself had to adapt to a change in the levels of expectation placed upon him, no longer allowed the defence of youthful naïveté. By the 1999–2000 season he had rediscovered his confidence and was being touted for an international call-up. A particular highlight of that season was his display in a 3–2 defeat of Celtic at Parkhead in February 2000. Hearts had trailed 2–0 before battling back to victory, with Naysmith striking a spectacular equalising goal.\n\nAs one of Hearts' most valuable assets, Naysmith was also the subject of transfer speculation. Financial concerns at the club heightened these and in October 2000 it appeared that Naysmith was bound for the West Midlands when Coventry City bid for him. However, their offer was bettered by Everton at the eleventh hour, and Naysmith moved to Merseyside instead, in a £1.7 million deal.\n\nNaysmith first became a regular under Walter Smith and then remained under his successor David Moyes. His early performances led to Everton fans nicknaming \"El Blanco Carlos\", after the Brazilian left-back Roberto Carlos. He made 152 appearances for Everton, scoring six goals, although his Everton career was disrupted by injury. In December 2002 he was the victim of a \"blood curdling, x-rated\" tackle by Liverpool's Steven Gerrard. A long term ankle injury in 2005 meant that Naysmith lost his first-team place at Everton to Alessandro Pistone in the 2004–05 season, and in the 2005–06 season Portuguese international Nuno Valente claimed the left back slot at Goodison Park.\n\nNaysmith recovered from ankle surgery in time for the start of the 2006–07 season and an injury to Valente in the season's opening game saw him restored to the starting eleven. He kept his place after Valente returned to fitness, however it was not long before injury befell him again, a medial ligament strain in the game against Newcastle United on 24 September 2006 keeping him out for two months.\n\nAt the end of the 2004–05 season, he signed a new three-year contract with the Blues. On 5 May 2007, Naysmith scored the third goal in a 3–0 victory over Portsmouth The win practically guaranteed that Everton would be playing in Europe during the 2007–08 season. Naysmith made over 130 Premier League appearances for the Toffees before leaving the club to join Championship side Sheffield United for £1 million in July 2007 as part of an exchange deal with Phil Jagielka.\n\nAs part of the deal that took Phil Jagielka to Goodison Park, Naysmith was given permission to speak to Sheffield United to discuss a possible move. He was signed by \"The Blades\" and agreed a three-year deal at Bramall Lane, thus ending a six-and-half-year stay with Everton.\n\nNaysmith made his first team début in the opening game of the 2007–08 season in a 2–2 home draw with Colchester United and quickly cemented his place in the side becoming the first choice at left back throughout the rest of the season. Naysmith started 42 games in his first season, 38 of them in the league.\n\nNaysmith started the 2008–09 season as first choice left back, playing 43 games until he suffered serious cruciate ligament damage which ruled him out for the final weeks of the season, thus missing the club's unsuccessful play-off campaign. He made his first start of the season on the opening day in United's 1–0 loss at Birmingham City. Naysmith started 37 league games and made a further two appearances from the bench.\n\nDue to an injury suffered towards the end of the 2008–09 season, Naysmith missed the majority of the 2009–10 season. He returned to the side in December 2009 and was listed as an unused substitute three times before making a successful return to the side for the last two games of the season, the first in The Blades 2–0 win over Swansea City, the second in their final day 3–0 win over Ipswich Town.\n\nNaysmith rejected a new deal at Bramall Lane, opting to sign a two-year deal with Yorkshire neighbours Huddersfield Town on 4 June 2010 on a free transfer. Naysmith revealed that he turned down offers from Premier League clubs where he would have had the chance to be a squad player to move to the Galpharm Stadium.\n\nOn 7 August 2010, Naysmith debuted for the \"Terriers\" in the 3–0 win versus Notts County at Meadow Lane. On 14 August 2010, Naysmith was then sent-off in his home debut for the \"Terriers\" versus Tranmere Rovers, as the match ended in a 0–0 draw. On 25 August 2010, Naysmith then suffered a toe injury in a League Cup second round 5–1 away defeat at his former club Everton, which caused him to miss the next five months of the season, as he eventually returned to play in a 2–0 home win versus Carlisle United in the league.\n\nNaysmith departed the club in June 2012 after not being offered a new contract by the \"Terriers\" manager, Simon Grayson.\n\nNaysmith returned to Scotland to train with Aberdeen in July 2012, joining the club on a pre-season tour of Germany. After a successful trial and impressing in games against Werder Bremen and FC St. Pauli, Naysmith signed a one-year deal on 1 August, but expressed a desire to earn an extension beyond the summer. On the opening day of the 2012–13 season, Aberdeen faced SPL champions Celtic. Naysmith was named in the starting team that narrowly lost out 1–0 at Celtic Park. It was announced on 13 May 2013 that Naysmith's contract along with another six players would not be extended.\n\nNaysmith represented Scotland at under-21, B and full international levels. He made his full Scotland debut in May 2000, in a 2–1 victory over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin, and earned 46 caps up to 2009. His only international goal arrived in 2002, during a UEFA Euro 2004 qualification game versus Iceland; he scored the second goal in a 2–0 win, with a right-footed volley from the edge of the penalty area.\n\nNaysmith also represented Scotland B on one occasion on 20 May 2003, in a 2–1 home win versus Northern Ireland B.\n\nOn 31 October 2013 Naysmith agreed to stay with League One East Fife until the end of the season in a player-assistant manager role. When manager Willie Aitchison left the club on 28 November, Naysmith was made caretaker manager, and was subsequently appointed as manager on a permanent basis on 18 December.\n\nOn 1 December 2016 and after three and a half seasons as player-manager of part-time club East Fife, Naysmith signed for Scottish Championship club Queen of the South as their new manager to go full-time in Dumfries.\n\nNaysmith's intention was to finish his playing career and his time as the Methil club's player-manager by taking charge of the club's Scottish Cup replay against Edinburgh City on 5 December 2016. However, as the match was postponed until 7 December 2016, Naysmith departed East Fife earlier than planned to be in charge of Queens' league match versus St Mirren on 6 December 2016 instead.\n\nNaysmith signed a contract with Scottish Championship club Queen of the South on 1 December 2016. After becoming team manager in the following week, Naysmith decided to end his playing career.\n\nNaysmith was named Scottish Championship Manager of the Month for January 2019. On 4 May 2019, after the \"Doonhamers\" were defeated 3-0 at home versus Partick Thistle and finished in the relegation play-off place in the Scottish Championship, Naysmith parted company with the Dumfries club.\n\nIn August 2019, Naysmith returned to Hearts in a newly-created role of managing players loaned out to other clubs.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2240319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2240319", "title": "Heat-Ray", "text": "Heat-Ray\n\nThe Heat-Ray is the primary offensive weapon used by the Martians in H. G. Wells' classic 1898 science fiction novel \"The War of the Worlds\" and its offshoots.\n\nThe Heat-Ray is essentially a directed-energy weapon, albeit the name of \"Heat-Ray\" is more commonly applied to the destructive energy it projects than to the weapon itself; the latter described as a box-like or camera-like case mounted on larger machines, including Tripod fighting-machines, whereas the Ray was credited with striking targets at distances of at least two miles.\n\nThe novel explains:\n\n\"in some way they are able to generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute non-conductivity. This intense heat they project in a parallel beam against any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic mirror of unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse projects a beam of light... it is certain that a beam of heat is the essence of the matter. Heat, and invisible, instead of visible, light. Whatever is combustible flashes into flame at its touch, lead runs like water, it softens iron, cracks and melts glass, and when it falls upon water, incontinently that explodes into steam.\nThe only visible element of the ray was a flash emitted from the chamber, in which respect Wells' description is consistent with experimental directed-energy weapons of later years (such as a powerful CO Laser).\n\nThe Heat-Ray is a feature of virtually every adaptation of the story. Many adaptations adhere to the characteristics given in the novel, such as the 1938 CBS radio adaptation; even reciting near-verbatim descriptions.\n\nThe Heat-Ray is described in \"Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds\" and depicted on the album artwork painted by Michael Trim as well as the art \"Panic in the Streets\" by Geoff Taylor, wherein it emanates from a proboscis in the cupola of the tripod.\n\nThe Classics Illustrated comic book adaptation of \"The War of the Worlds\" portrays the Heat-Ray as a visible light yellowish/gold ray.\n\nIn the early science fiction novel \"Edison's Conquest of Mars\", as an answer to the Martian Heat-Ray, Thomas Edison designs a disintegrator ray for use by human invasion forces. This is the first appearance of such a device in science fiction.\n\nIn \"Sherlock Holmes's War of the Worlds\", the Heat-Ray is described as based on nuclear energy, and projected from a pink-hued, multifaceted focusing crystal.\n\nIn the spoof film \"Scary Movie 4\", the Heat-Ray's effects are given a comical treatment; the intersection scene shows a lady push another into the path of the Heat-Ray to get her clothes. In one scene, the President of the United States, played by Leslie Nielsen, announces to the United Nations that America has managed to capture a Heat-Ray. Its effects have been reversed, comically destroying the clothes of everyone in the room, with the President barely aware.\n\nIn Stephen Baxter's sequel, \"The Massacre of Mankind\", the Heat-Ray is said to be an infrared laser with a beam temperature of 1500 degrees. The parabolic mirror is merely an aiming scope. A memorial to Heat-Ray victims, the \"Tomb of the Vanished Warrior\", is established in 1908, a year after the invasion; at the event, Prime Minister Henry Campbell-Bannerman was assassinated by members of the Women's Social and Political Union. \n\nFor the 1953 film version, the Martians manta ray-shaped war machines use a combination of three rays: one Heat-Ray on long necks atop of their machines, which fire red sparks, and two disintegrator rays on their wing tips, which are shown as green bolts. These two can only be pointed in the direction their ships face, while the Heat-Ray on top can be pointed in any direction. Most of their targets glow and vanish, sometimes leaving a stain or pile of ash; the Heat-Ray differs from the disintegrators as the former sets the surrounding environment ablaze as well as vaporizing the target within a few seconds. Although the Heat-Ray does have a simple destructive effect on certain objects, at other times, the ray would set objects ablaze or cause them to explode (as shown when the machines reach Los Angeles). In one scene, General Mann states that it is likely the Martians generate radiation without using heavy screening to power their rays. The book's poisonous \"Black Smoke\" chemical weapon is replaced by the \"\"skeleton beam\"\". Doctor Clayton Forrester explained how these skeleton beams worked as such:\n\nAs a sequel to the 1953 film, the Heat-Ray's use in the 1988 \"War of the Worlds\" TV series is rather notable. Aside from their employment in the first episode (its destruction replayed in the opening credit sequence in subsequent episodes of the season), the main Heat-Ray is put to more attention in an episode in which the aliens are unable to unearth a buried warship from a recon mission and are forced to remove the gooseneck device from the ship and strap it atop a hearse. The aliens' mission in this episode is put to end when the Heat-Ray hits them after being reflected off a makeshift parabolic mirror.\n\nThe series also offered a Heat-Ray not employed by a war machine, but as a personal weapon. \"The Second Seal\" episode deals with the discovery of archives that contain remnants of the 1953 invasion. Among the material found is a boomerang-shaped weapon that fires Heat-Rays. These rays are the kind of green blobs fired from the tips of their warships, and are similarly shot from the ends of the object. \n\nThe Heat-Rays featured in the series mirror the same power of the film. This includes the variation between their ability to visibly destroy something as well as simply making a target disappear. Although the word \"Heat-Ray\" is never applied in the series as it is in the 1953 or updated 2005 film, the term used in one episode is \"Death-Ray\".\n\nIn Steven Spielberg's 2005 \"War of the Worlds\" adaptation of Wells' novel, the Heat-Ray is portrayed as two bluish-white rays having a desiccating effect on living objects, such as animals, and a 'disruptive' effect on other objects; but a bridge in one scene is thrown from its pylons when hit by the ray, as if physically struck, and in an earlier scene, brick-and-wood buildings are either destroyed or catch fire. Later in the movie, an army of tripods destroying a city is shown, with Heat-Rays collapsing targeted buildings in a similar fashion to the destruction of the bridge. Curiously, human clothing does not seem to be affected by the Heat-Rays, which is used to effect in one of the film's scenes when the clothes of slaughtered humans are floating along a river.\n\nIn The Asylum's 2005 film \"H.G Wells' War of the Worlds\" (also entitled \"Invasion\"), the Heat-Ray is seen as a bluish-green light and is built inside the \"walkers\", which are not tripods, but six-legged machines resembling crabs. The ray fires from the walker's single \"eye\". When the ray hits humans, they are instantly burned to the bone. The ray can also be used to destroy buildings. A character named Pvt. Kerry Williams compares the ray's effect on a human to a fly zapper's effect on a fly.\n\nIn the film's sequel, \"\", a kind of Heat-ray can be seen firing from the 'squid-walkers', a living race of flying cybernetic tripods; but the effects of this weapon are largely unknown, as the ray itself is used infrequently. It is most notably used to devastate London and Paris. Another kind of ray is also attached to the machines, but it is made to transport living humans into the mothership.\n\nIn the lesser-known 2005 low-budget, direct-to-video film adaptation from Pendragon Pictures, \"H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds\", the generator is held by a small arm that extends from the hood of the machine (not one of the many visible tentacles/arms they use to capture humans). Three metallic fingers hold a rapidly spinning disc, generating the Heat-Ray; and when it touches flesh, the victim is reduced to bones.\n\nThere are Heat-Rays used by both humans and martians in this 2012 animated film, wherein human Heat-Rays are a reddish-orange color and the Martian Heat-Rays light green.\n\n"}

He is best known for playing bass guitar for the UK punk rock band The Shapes. He also played for many other bands, the most notable being the NWOBHM bands Rogue Male and HellsBelles. For a short time in the early 1980s, he was also a member of British R&B band The Mosquitos, with guitarist Steve Walwyn of Dr. Feelgood and Eddie and the Hot Rods, and can be seen on the cover of The Mosquitos only single \"Somethin' Outta Nothin'\". A prolific session player, he appears both credited and uncreditied on many releases throughout the 1980s and early 1990s under both his real and stage name. He was one of the first bassists in the nascent UK punk scene to adopt the Rickenbacker bass guitar which he still uses to this day. He was also one of the first bass guitarists in the world to use Trace Elliot amplification. His bass playing style is characterized by a very fast precise pick attack, and fast runs. Unusually for a bass guitarist, he sometimes utilizes an overhand tapping technique more common to six string players. He continues to play professionally, reverting between his real name and his stage name as the fancy takes him. He is also a professional skydiving coach and instructor, currently holding seven world records in the sport. He can be seen in an episode of MythBusters aired on the Discovery Channel taking presenter Kari Byron skydiving whilst testing the falling airplane blue ice myth. He is also a vegetarian. He can be seen in the independent film Six Sex Scenes and a Murder, in the role of the bounty hunter. He currently resides in California, where he plays bass for the San Francisco Bay Area band Ghosthookers. Ghosthookers released a record in 2008 which features Brian Helicopter on bass under his real name.\n\nIn late 2008, he rejoined the original line-up of The Shapes for short tour of the UK to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the band, culminating in dates with The Damned in London, and once again in 2014 for the \"You'll Do Yourself a Mischief\" tour of the UK, to support the re-release of the Shapes's first two singles, and the re-release of the album on 12 inch vinyl, called \"More Songs for Sensible People\"\n\nIn 2016, he once more joined The Shapes for the \"We're Not Very Famous\" tour of the UK, and to record new material, and in 2017 undertook tours of Japan and the UK with them.\n\nBrian Helicopter uses Rickenbacker 4000 series basses exclusively. All of his basses are set up slightly differently so as to achieve different sounds live or in the studio. His main stage bass is a 1975 4001 model finished in jetglo. This model has been customized with checkerboard binding and a half inched spaced classic reissue toaster pickup in the neck position. His other basses are a 1979 fireglo 4001 which is customized with a one-inch spaced custom Sergio Silva hand wound toaster in the neck position and a Rickenbacker reissue horseshoe pickup in the bridge position. With the Ghosthookers, his main stage bass is a rare hand carved 4004LK bass, the Lemmy of Motörhead limited edition model. Less than 60 of these were produced, his personal bass is number 26 in that series. He also uses two mono basses, a highly customized azureglo 4001S with Rickenbacker reissue toaster and horseshoe pickups, and a 4001CS Chris Squire of Yes limited edition bass. He has number 270 in that series of 1000 produced. He also occasionally uses a lightly modified custom 4008 eight string bass. He also uses a 1995 mapleglo 4003 fretless bass, a 1973 jetglo 4001, and a single pickup 1972 4000 series bass.\n\nHis amplification is by Trace Elliot. Currently he uses a GP12SMX dual compressor preamp with AH250 power stage, and a GP7 preamp with AH350 power stage. This gives him the option to run his 4001 series basses in stereo live and to EQ each pickup separately. He runs the amps through two 1048 dual ported 4x10 cabinets with high frequency horns, and two dual ported 1015 1x15 cabinets.\n"}

The works by Zvi Griliches mostly concerned the economics of technological change, including empirical studies of diffusion of innovations and the role of R & D, patents, and education.\n\nHe was born in Kaunas, Lithuania in an assimilated Jewish family that spoke Russian at home. During World War II he was sent to the Dachau concentration camp. In 1947 he emigrated to Palestine, where he served in the pre-state Israeli army, learned Hebrew, passed high school equivalence exam, and studied for a year at Hebrew University. He then moved to the United States, where he earned a B.S. in Agricultural Economics from the University of California, Berkeley, and then a Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Chicago, supervised by Theodore Schultz.\n\nIn his classic 1957 Ph.D. dissertation, \"Hybrid Corn: An Exploration in the Economics of Technological Change\", published as an article in the October 1957 issue of \"Econometrica\", Griliches demonstrated that the penetration of corn seeds followed the logistic curve. It was found later through multiple examples by Edwin Mansfield and other researchers that this is a general rule for technological change / diffusion of innovations. The dissertation was one of the first scientific works that treated the development of new technology as an economic phenomenon. Previously, economists had treated it as exogenous.\n\nMost innovations either make production more efficient, or improve the quality of goods. The analysis of measurement of the impact of innovations on economics led Griliches to his fundamental studies of economic growth, productivity, production function, consumption function, measurements of economic input and output, hedonic prices, and their reflection in price indices.\n\nGriliches also published important works of econometrics, including distributed lags (time series) and aggregation. He was particularly interested in the measurements of hidden variables.\n\nGriliches served as the President of the Econometric Society in 1975, and as the President of the American Economic Association in 1993. From 1969 to 1977 he was one of editors of the journal \"Econometrica\". He served on the Stigler Commission in 1961 and the Boskin Commission in 1996, both of which were convened by the United States Senate to evaluate the measurement of inflation.\n\nIn 1965, Zvi Griliches won the prestigious John Bates Clark Medal.

In January 2007 he moved to Derby County, whom he helped achieve promotion to the Premier League, later having loans at Stoke City and Bristol City, whom he joined permanently in 2012. After featuring for the Kerala Blasters in the inaugural season of the Indian Super League, Pearson returned to Motherwell in 2015 before mutually terminating his contract a year later to return to India with Atlético de Kolkata. He signed for Motherwell for a third time in February 2017.\n\nPearson earned 10 caps for Scotland between 2003 and 2007.\n\nPearson was born in Lanark. As a boy, he attended Our Lady's High School in Motherwell and is one of the school's numerous footballing alumni, a list which includes such luminaries as Sir Matt Busby, Billy McNeill, and Bobby Murdoch. Though he grew up a Celtic fan, he began his footballing career at Motherwell, after they watched him score the winning goal in the final of the under-18 Scottish Schools competition.\n\nMotherwell were a financially troubled club at this time and in 2002 they were placed in administration to prevent liquidation, with 19 senior players released. This period of adversity did however have one redeeming feature, as many talented young players, notably Pearson and his friend and fellow emerging talent James McFadden, gained instant elevation to first team status and a chance to develop and hone their skills more quickly than contemporaries at other clubs.\n\nAfter a period of acclimatisation under new manager Terry Butcher during which Motherwell finished bottom of the SPL in the 2002–03 season, avoiding relegation only because Falkirk's Brockville Park ground failed to reach SPL standard, by December 2003 the youthful Motherwell team were comfortably in mid-table. Pearson's form was such that he gained a surprise call-up to Berti Vogts' full Scotland squad, winning his first cap in the 1–0 Euro 2004 play-off victory over the Netherlands, and attracted interest from clubs at home and abroad.\n\nHowever, Motherwell's financial predicament ensured they were unable to refuse any reasonable offers and when Celtic manager Martin O'Neill paid £350,000 of his own personal money in January 2004, Pearson fulfilled a childhood ambition by moving to Parkhead. He continued his fine form, notably in Celtic's epic UEFA Cup defeat of FC Barcelona, was in the starting eleven in the Cup Final and won the Scottish PFA Young Player of the Year award for the 2003–04 season.\n\nPearson was unable to match these achievements in 2004–05. He increased his international tally to six caps, but his first team opportunities were limited by injury, and he played just nine games for Celtic that season. The 2005–06 season saw little improvement as he made only three starting appearances in a relatively injury-hit season. In January 2006 he held talks with manager Gordon Strachan, who reassured him as to his future with the club. Pearson did however make 17 substitute appearances and scored a crucial goal against Hearts at Tynecastle as Celtic came from behind to win 3–2.\n\nThough Pearson had been involved in two Scottish Premier League-winning campaigns with Celtic, he struggled to hold down a regular place. English Championship side Derby County, managed by his former Motherwell manager Billy Davies, made a bid of £600,000 in August 2006, but Strachan said he was not for sale. The departure of Stiliyan Petrov to Aston Villa gave Pearson an opportunity to regain a place in the Celtic midfield and, despite rumours of a move away from Celtic Park, he went on to score the third goal against Benfica in the group stages of the 2006–07 Champions League, to take the score to 3–0. He described this goal as \"the moment of my career\".\n\nPearson eventually signed a three-and-a-half-year deal for Derby on 10 January 2007 for a fee of £750,000. and made his debut in a 1–0 win against Sheffield Wednesday, which put Derby level on points at the top of the division. A latter season drop in form saw the club finish in third place and having to compete in the playoffs. Pearson played a key role in Derby's success, winning a penalty in a 2–1 win over Southampton in the semi-final first leg and then scoring the winning goal, his first for the club, as Derby ran out 1–0 winners over West Bromwich Albion in the 2007 Championship playoff final. Pearson's strike has been described as \"the £60 million goal\", such is the perceived value of promotion from the Championship to the Premier League.\n\nDerby struggled badly following promotion and, after a promising beginning to the season Pearson soon found himself out of the side. He was loaned out to Stoke City for three months at the end of the season but only made four appearances, though he did contribute to the club's promotion, his second in twelve months. Though the move was initially with a view to a permanent deal, Stoke decided not to follow up their interest and he returned to Derby. In July 2008, Birmingham City had a £600,000 bid accepted and Pearson agreed personal terms, but his medical examination revealed a groin tear; the clubs agreed a loan deal instead, but the player rejected this arrangement. When Pearson recovered, he won his place back in the side and scored against Swansea City in a 1–1 away draw, but after a handful of starts suffered another injury which kept him out for 4 months. Pearson made his return from injury in the final minutes of Derby's FA Cup 5th round tie against Manchester United on 15 February 2009, but suffered setbacks on his road to recovery, finally starting again for the club against Burnley on 4 April 2009. and appearing in a further five games before the season ended, finishing the season with just 13 appearances in all competitions. Pearson enjoyed a more productive 2009–10 season with the club, making 34 starts and making a further 8 appearances as sub and impressed enough to earn a new contract until the end of the 2011–12 season from Derby manager Nigel Clough. He got his third Derby goal, and his first for 18 months, with the consolation strike in a 2–1 defeat at Bristol City in the penultimate game of Derby's 2009–10 campaign before a knee operation ruled him out for the next four months, meaning he would miss pre-season and the first four to six weeks of the 2010–11 season.\n\nPearson returned to first team action as a second-half substitute in a 1–1 draw at Barnsley on 18 September 2010; Derby's seventh game of the 2010–11 season.\n\nOn 4 November 2011, Pearson joined Championship strugglers Bristol City on loan until 2 January 2012. He scored the opening goal on his debut against Burnley on 5 November 2011, a game which Bristol City won 3–1. Pearson impressed Bristol City manager Derek McInnes during his loan spell, with Rams manager Nigel Clough confirming talks between the two clubs over a potential permanent move in the January transfer window. On 6 January 2012, Pearson's contract at Derby was terminated by mutual consent and on the same day Pearson signed for Bristol City on a contract until the end of the 2011–12 season. On 7 June 2012, Bristol City confirmed that Pearson had signed a two-year deal at the club.\nOn 19 September 2013, it was announced that Pearson had undergone ankle surgery, keeping him out for six months. At the end of the 2013–14 season, Pearson was released by Bristol City.\n\nPearson joined Indian Super League side Kerala Blasters for the 2014 season. On 16 December 2014, he scored his first goal for the club in the 117th minute of second leg of the play-off semifinals against Chennaiyin FC with a neat finish with his left foot, which turned out to be the winner.\n\nOn 19 January 2015, Pearson returned to Motherwell for a second spell, signing until the end of the 2014–15 season. He made his second debut for the club on 21 January 2015, in a 4–0 defeat against his former club Celtic. On 3 April 2015, Pearson signed a new two-year contract with Motherwell, keeping him at the club until 2017. He scored the first goal of his second spell at the club on 4 April 2015, in a 2–1 win away to Kilmarnock.\n\nOn 29 June 2016, Motherwell confirmed that they and Pearson had come to a mutual agreement to allow Pearson's contract to be terminated in order for the midfielder to join Indian Super League side Atlético de Kolkata.\n\nOn 2 February 2017, Pearson signed for Motherwell for a third time, agreeing a contract until the end of the 2016–17 season. He was released by the club in May 2017, at the end of his contract.\n\nPearson made his international debut for Scotland on 15 November 2003, replacing Neil McCann for the final 20 minutes of a 1–0 first leg win over the Netherlands at Hampden Park in the play-off for UEFA Euro 2004; he did not feature in the second leg, which saw the Dutch qualify. He made one appearance in Scotland's 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, as a 63rd-minute substitute for Richard Hughes in a 0–1 home defeat to Norway on 9 October 2004. Pearson earned ten caps in all for Scotland, his last being on 17 October 2007 in a 2–0 away defeat to Georgia in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying, playing the first 66 minutes before being replaced by Kris Boyd.\n\nSource:\n\n\n"}

Whereas an arithmetic progression is generated by a single common difference, a generalized arithmetic progression can be generated by multiple common differences. For example, the sequence formula_1 is not an arithmetic progression, but is instead generated by starting with 17 and adding either 3 \"or\" 5, thus allowing multiple common differences to generate it. \n\nA finite generalized arithmetic progression, or sometimes just generalized arithmetic progression (GAP), of dimension \"d\" is defined to be a set of the form\nwhere formula_3. The product formula_4 is called the size of the generalized arithmetic progression; the cardinality of the set can differ from the size if some elements of the set have multiple representations. If the cardinality equals the size, the progression is called proper. Generalized arithmetic progressions can be thought of as a projection of a higher dimensional grid into formula_5. This projection is injective if and only if the generalized arithmetic progression is proper.\n\nFormally, an arithmetic progression of formula_6 is an infinite sequence of the form formula_7, where formula_8 and formula_9 are fixed vectors in formula_6, called the initial vector and common difference respectively. A subset of formula_6 is said to be linear if it is of the form\nwhere formula_13 is some integer and formula_14 are fixed vectors in formula_6.

G. Wells' 1898 science fiction novel \"The War of the Worlds\", used by the Martians to eliminate groups of humans, especially artillery crews, and conveyed by shells fired from a gun-like \"\"black tube\"\" carried by the Tripods' whip-like tentacles. Any animal inhaling this deadly smoke is killed almost instantly, but the smoke becomes harmless on contact with water. The Martians would dispel it after each use with jets of steam, leaving only a residual, \"cindery\" black powder, which reminds the narrator of what he \"read of the destruction of Pompeii\". The smoke is very dense, and can be avoided by climbing to higher places. Although Wells never explains the smoke's mechanism in the novel, he mentions that it may bind with argon to become toxic. In reality, argon cannot combine with other elements, with the marginal exception of fluorine, but chemical weapons were widely used in human warfare after Wells' novel was written, especially in World War I.\n\nOrson Welles' radio adaptation dramatizes the effects of the black smoke: The poison is depicted as being potent enough to render gas masks useless, as do modern nerve gases.\n\nThe only accurate screen appearance of the black smoke is in Pendragon Pictures' film adaptation, wherein the Martians only use the smoke twice, and it is not described in any detail.\n\nThe black smoke is briefly mentioned in the 1978 musical version, where a tripod releases it while engaging the \"Thunder Child\" and later when the narrator is trapped. Its effects are not mentioned, however. This is likely the result of an earlier usage being removed at the script editing stage. This musical version featured musicians known as the Black Smoke Band.\n\nIn the 1998 PC game, the black smoke can be launched from cannons by three Martian Machine units: the Fighting Machine, the Bombarding Machine, and the Tempest. The smoke deals fatal damage to any human vehicles that come close to it, but its effect varies according to the type of canister.\n\nThe Asylum film \"H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds\" features a deadly gas, but it is green rather than black in color. The \"green smoke\" does appear to have the same deadly effect as the black smoke, and the same density. Whereas the novel's smoke is launched from \"\"black tubes\"\" attached to the fighting-machines on an arm, this smoke leaks from a small object ejected from the same slot from which the Heat Ray is fired. The smoke in the novel was described as an ink-like vapour, but the film's smoke is believed to be a kind of toxic gas. It is not described in detail.\n\nIn the Asylum's 2008 sequel, \"\", the black smoke is absent, though chemical warfare is briefly mentioned. A fleet of jets, upgraded with the Martian technology left from the first film, are equipped with a kind of Heat-Ray and missiles containing mustard gas, a weapon only used in warfare once before, in World War I.\n\nThe black smoke is not used in Steven Spielberg's 2005 adaptation, but was a considered addition as early as a first draft until it was dropped due to paucity of time. It is also absent from the TV series, though the aliens do make attempts at chemical warfare.\n\nThe black smoke appears, along with most technology of the Martians, as described by Wells in Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill's comic book \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II\".\n\nIn Stephen Baxter's sequel, \"The Massacre of Mankind\", areas sprayed with the black smoke and infested with the red weed are still barren thirteen years after the 1907 invasion, due to the lingering toxicity.\n\nIn the 2019 BBC miniseries, tripods are seen systematically dispersing black clouds over the streets of London. This version is apparently less lethal than the one in Wells' novel. In the novel the smoke is instantly fatal to anything that breathes. In the series a Cabinet minister is seen narrowly escaping the attack after having been engulfed in the smoke. However, a few minutes after his apparent escape he begins to profusely vomit what appears to be his own blood. The smoke wraps itself around the minister once more, hiding the minister's apparent death from the viewer's eye while those around him make a quick escape on foot.\n"}

She was born in Weißwasser, East Germany. Luding is one of the few athletes who have competed in both the Summer and Winter Olympic Games, and the first female to win a medal in both the Summer and Winter Games. She is the only athlete to win Winter and Summer Olympic medals in the same year (1988), a feat that is no longer possible due to the staggering of the Winter and Summer Olympic years. In speed skating, she is a two-time Olympic gold medallist, while she is an Olympic silver medallist in cycling.\nBefore the German reunification in 1990, Luding competed for East Germany – afterwards for Germany. For more than 10 years, she was one of the world's best sprinters in speed skating. At the World Sprint Championships in speed skating, she became world champion twice (in 1985 and 1988), won silver twice (in 1986 and 1989), and won 4 bronze medals (in 1979, 1983, 1987 and 1992). She has also won the 500 m World Cup 3 times (in 1986, 1988 and 1989) and the 1000 m World Cup once (in 1988).\n\nIn 1980, she was convinced by her coach, Ernst Luding (whom she would marry after the 1988 Winter Olympics), to take up cycling during the off-season. First she was told to stick to skating, but finally the president of the East German sports federation gave her permission to enter international cycling competitions. At the 1986 World Cycling Championships, she won track cycling gold in the women's sprint and silver the following year. This made her the second woman (after Sheila Young) to become world champion in both speed skating and cycling. In October 1986, she was awarded a Star of People's Friendship in gold (second class) for her sporting success.\n\nIn 1988, she earned the distinction of being the only athlete to win Summer and Winter Olympic medals in the same year. It also made her the first woman, and the third athlete overall, to win a medal in both the Summer and Winter Olympics. At the Winter Games in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, she won the gold medal in the 1000 m speed skating event and silver in the 500 m.

{"id": "2240362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2240362", "title": "Panchira", "text": "Panchira\n\nIn anime and manga, \"panchira\" usually refers to a panty-shot, a visual convention used extensively by Japanese artists and animators since the early 1960s. According to Japanese sources, the convention probably started with Machiko Hasegawa's popular comic strip \"Sazae-san\", whose character designs for Wakame Isono incorporated an improbably brief hemline. The practice was later transferred to animation when Osamu Tezuka's \"Astro Boy\" was adapted for television in 1963. Confined mainly to harmless children's series throughout the remainder of the decade, panchira took on more overtly fetishistic elements during the early seventies. From that point on, \"panchira\" became linked with sexual humor such as the kind found in many comedy oriented \"shōnen manga\".\n\nThe word is a portmanteau of and \"chira\", the Japanese sound symbolism representing a glance or glimpse. It differs from the more general term \"upskirt\" in that panchira specifies the presence of underpants (the absence of which would more accurately be described as ノーパン; nōpan). The word \"panchira\" is similar to panty peek in English.\n\nThe development of panchira in Japanese popular culture has been analyzed by a number of American and Japanese writers. Many observers link the phenomenon to the Westernization of Japan following World War II. During the occupation, fashions, ideas, and media previously unavailable were accessed by the local population, leading to a slight relaxing of earlier taboos. Western-style clothing (including women's underwear) gained popularity in the post-war period, reinforced through numerous media outlets — magazines, newspapers, films, journals, and comics.\n\nTraditionally, Japanese women did not wear underwear. On December 16, 1932, there was a fire in the Tokyo Shirokiya department store. Legend has it that some of the female staff tried to use their kimonos to cover their privates as they climbed down ropes from the higher floors, and accidentally fell to their deaths. Japanese newspapers began agitating for women to start wearing 'drawers' (ズローズ zurōzu), but seemingly had little impact at the time. In a 1934 survey by a Fukuoka newspaper, 90% of the women surveyed were still not wearing 'drawers' a year and a half after the fire.\n\nAt least one Japanese source traces the beginnings of panchira to the release of \"The Seven Year Itch\" in 1955. The media coverage surrounding Marilyn Monroe's iconic scene fueled the emerging Japanese craze. According to architectural historian Shoichi Inoue, the practice of \"scoring\" a glimpse up young women's skirts became extremely popular around this period; \"Magazines of the time have articles telling the best places where panties could be viewed\". Inoue also writes that actress Mitsuyo Asaka spurred the popularity of the word 'chirarizumu' (チラリズム 'the thrill of catching a brief glimpse of a women's nether regions') by parting her kimono to show off her legs in her stage shows in the late 1950s.\n\nIn 1969, the Japanese oil company Maruzen Sekiyū released a television commercial featuring Rosa Ogawa in a mini-skirt that gets blown up by the wind and her lips forming an 'O' in surprise. This led to children imitating her line \"Oh! Mōretsu\" (Oh！モーレツ, too much, radical), and a fad for sukāto-mekuri (スカート捲り flipping up of a girl's skirt). Ogawa subsequently appeared in a TV show \"Oh Sore Miyo\" (Oh! それ見よ, literally \"look at that,\" but actually a pun on 'O Sole Mio,' a neapolitan song 'my sunshine') that again featured scenes of her mini-skirt blowing up.\n\nBy the late 1960s, panchira had spread to the mainstream comic industry, as fledgling manga artists such as Go Nagai began exploring sexual imagery in boys' comics (shōnen manga). Adult manga magazines had existed since 1956 (e.g. \"Weekly Manga Times\"), but it is significant to note the introduction of sexual imagery into boys manga. Millegan argues that the ecchi genre of the 1970s rose to fill a void left by the decline of Osaka's lending library network:\nJapanese comics did not seriously begin exploring erotic themes until the sixties, with the collapse of the pay-library system (largely brought about by the unexpected success of cheap comic magazines such as Kodansha Publishing's Shōnen Magazine). Artists working for the pay-library system had already pioneered the depiction of graphic violence, and had proudly declared that they were drawing gekiga (\"drama pictures\"), not mere comics. In the search for realism (and readers), it was inevitable that sex would soon make an appearance.\n\nAs the Japanese comics market diversified, sex spread beyond the gekiga to just about every conceivable niche in the marketplace. The gekiga continued their realistic and often violent depictions, but the other major divisions in the manga world developed their own approach. Boys' comics began to explore \"cute\" sex, mainly consisting of panchira (\"panty shots\") and girls in showers.\n\nA generalized perspective is provided by Mio Bryce's analysis of classroom imagery in Japanese comics. Using Go Nagai's Harenchi Gakuen as a prime example, Bryce notes that Nagai's storylines challenged long-standing social values by ridiculing traditional authority figures. Teachers in Nagai's manga were portrayed as deviants and perverts, engaging in various forms of aggressively voyeuristic behavior towards their female students. In this regard, panchira was employed as a form of social satire, voicing a general mistrust of authoritarian regimes.\n\nIn much the same vein, Bouissou states that Harenchi Gakuen 'smashed' the Japanese taboo against eroticism in children's comics, indicative of the rapidly changing cultural attitudes endemic to late 60s Japan. Although the eroticism was confined mainly to panchira and soft-core cartoon nudity, the manga's impact was felt all across the country. As Bouissou points out, the publication of Harenchi Gakuen sparked a \"nationwide boom of \"sukāto mekuri\" (to flip up a girl's skirt)\".\n\nJonathan Abel's work on the unmentionables of Japanese film argues that the cultivation of the underwear fetish through roman poruno films after a police seizure may have first been evidence of covering up, but rapidly became a signifier of that which could never be attained. Abel's psychoanalytical approach then calls for the use of \"panchira\" as a term for eroticization of the invisible.\n\nThere are few academic studies dealing \"specifically\" with panchira; the subject has been touched on by several writers under the broader context of the male gaze. From the Western perspective, panchira is characterized by the sexual stereotyping inherent in patriarchal culture. Anne Allison makes reference to the convention in \"Permitted and Prohibited Desires,\" theorizing that the exposure of women's (or girls') underwear in ero-manga is constructed as an \"immobilizing glance\", in the sense that panchira is usually presented as a tableau in which the (female) object of desire is 'petrified' by the male gaze.She further postulates that this 'glance' is generally depicted as transgressive: the audience is permitted a glimpse of the female body (partially) unclothed, but it is always framed as a forbidden action. This prohibitive tableau permeates the entire genre, as virtually all ero-manga follows the same formula of transgression and immobilization.\n\nSimilarly, Anne Cooper-Chen states that the endlessly repeated image \"of a male gazing at a female's panty clad crotch\" represents an archetypal manga panel. She supports Allison's view that women/girls portrayed in their underwear (or naked) is a common motif in Japanese comics, and is most frequently accompanied by a masculine \"viewer\" whose voyeuristic presence is indicative of the male gaze. However, in contrast to Allison, Cooper-Chen's observations are not confined only to the \"ero\" market. Rather, she argues that the dominant trope of frustrated desire and sexual violence may be extended to the manga mainstream.\n\n"}

Terrestrial television is broadcast on frequencies from about 47 to 250 MHz in the very high frequency (VHF) band, and 470 to 960 MHz in the ultra high frequency (UHF) band in different countries. Television antennas are manufactured in two different types: \"indoor\" antennas, to be located on top of or next to the television set, and \"outdoor\" antennas, mounted on a mast on top of the owner's house. They can also be mounted in a loft or attic, where the dry conditions and increased elevation are advantageous for reception and antenna longevity. Outdoor antennas are more expensive and difficult to install, but are necessary for adequate reception in fringe areas far from television stations. The most common types of indoor antennas are the dipole (\"rabbit ears\") and loop antennas, and for outdoor antennas the yagi, log periodic, and for UHF channels the multi-bay reflective array antenna.\n\nThe purpose of the antenna is to intercept radio waves from the desired television stations and convert them to tiny radio frequency alternating currents which are applied to the television's tuner, which extracts the television signal. The antenna is connected to the television with a specialized cable designed to carry radio current, called transmission line. Earlier antennas used a flat cable called 300 ohm Twin Lead. The standard today is 75 ohm coaxial cable, which is less susceptible to interference, which plugs into an F connector on the back of the TV. \n\nIn most countries, television broadcasting is allowed in the very high frequency (VHF) band from 47 to 68 MHz, called VHF low band or band I in Europe; 174 to 216 MHz, called VHF high band or band III in Europe, and in the ultra high frequency (UHF) band from 470 to 698 MHz, called band IV and V in Europe. The boundaries of each band vary somewhat in different countries. Radio waves in these bands travel by line-of-sight; they are blocked by hills and the visual horizon, limiting a television station's reception area to , depending on terrain.\n\nIn the previous standard analog television, used before 2006, the VHF and UHF bands required separate tuners in the television receiver, which had separate antenna inputs. The wavelength of a radio wave equals the speed of light (c) divided by the frequency. The above frequency bands cover a 15:1 wavelength ratio, or almost 4 octaves. It is difficult to design a single antenna to receive such a wide wavelength range, and there is an octave gap from 216 to 470 MHz between the VHF and UHF frequencies. So traditionally separate antennas (or on outdoor antennas separate sets of elements on a single support boom) have been used to receive the VHF and UHF channels. \n\nStarting in 2006 many countries in the world switched from broadcasting using an older analog television standard to newer digital television (DTV). However generally the same broadcast frequencies are used, so the same antennas used for the older analog television will also receive the new DTV broadcasts. Sellers often claim to supply a special \"digital\" or \"high-definition television\" (HDTV) antenna advised as a replacement for an existing analog television antenna; at best this is misinformation to generate sales of unneeded equipment, at worst it may leave the viewer with a UHF-only antenna in a local market (particularly in North America) where some digital stations remain on their original high VHF frequencies.\n\nIndoor antennas may be mounted on the television itself or stand on a table next to it, connected to the television by a short feedline. Due to space constraints indoor antennas cannot be as large and elaborate as outdoor antennas, and they are not mounted at as high an elevation; for these reasons indoor antennas generally do not give as good reception as outdoor antennas. They are often perfectly adequate in urban and suburban areas which are usually within the strong radiation \"footprint\" of local television stations, but in rural fringe reception areas only an outdoor antenna may give adequate reception. A few of the simplest indoor antennas are described below, but a great variety of designs and types exist. Many have a dial on the antenna with a number of different settings to alter the antenna's reception pattern. This should be rotated with the set on while looking at the screen, until the best picture is obtained. \n\nThe oldest and most widely used indoor antenna is the \"rabbit ears\" or \"bunny ears\", which are often provided with new television sets. It is a simple half-wave dipole antenna used to receive the VHF television bands, consisting in the US of 54 to 88 MHz (band I) and 174 to 216 MHz (band III), with wavelengths of 5.5 to 1.4 m. It is constructed of two telescoping rods attached to a base, which extend out to about 1 meter length (approximately one quarter wavelength at 54 MHz), and can be collapsed when not in use. For best reception the rods should be adjusted to be a little less than 1/4 wavelength at the frequency of the television channel being received. However the dipole has a wide bandwidth, so often adequate reception is achieved without adjusting the length. The half wave dipole has a low gain of about 2.14 dBi; this means it is not as directional and sensitive to distant stations as a large rooftop antenna, but its wide angle reception pattern may allow it to receive several stations located in different directions without requiring readjustment when the channel is changed. Dipole antennas are bi-directional, that is, they have two main lobes in opposite directions, 180° apart. Instead of being fixed in position like other antennas, the elements are mounted on ball-and-socket joints and can be adjusted to various angles in a \"V\" shape, allowing them to be moved out of the way in crowded quarters. Another reason for the V shape is that when receiving channels at the top of the band with the rods fully extended, the antenna elements will typically resonate at their 3rd harmonic. In this mode the direction of maximum gain (the main lobe) is no longer perpendicular to the rods, but the radiation pattern will have lobes at an angle to the rods, making it advantageous to be able to adjust them to various angles\n\nSome portable televisions use a whip antenna. This consists of a single telescoping rod about a meter long attached to the television, which can be retracted when not in use. It functions as a quarter-wave monopole antenna. The other side of the feedline is connected to the ground plane on the TV's circuit board, which acts as ground. The whip antenna generally has an omnidirectional reception pattern, with maximum sensitivity in directions perpendicular to the antenna axis, and gain similar to the half-wave dipole.\n\nThe UHF channels are often received by a single turn loop antenna. Since a \"rabbit ears\" antenna only covers the VHF bands, it is often combined with a UHF loop mounted on the same base to cover all the TV channels.\n\nSoon after television broadcasting switched from analog to digital broadcasting, indoor antenna marketing evolved beyond the traditional \"rabbit ears.\" Flat antennas are lightweight, thin, and usually square-shaped with the claim of having more omnidirectional reception. They connect to televisions only with a coaxial cable; they may also be sold with a signal amplifier requiring a power source. Internally, the thin, flat square is a loop antenna, with its circular metallic wiring embedded into conductive plastic.\n\nWhen a higher gain antenna is needed to achieve adequate reception in suburban or fringe reception areas, an outdoor directional antenna is usually used. Although most simple antennas have null directions where they have zero response, the directions of useful gain are very broad. In contrast, \ndirectional antennas can have an almost unidirectional radiation pattern so the correct end of the antenna must be pointed at the TV station. As an antenna design provides higher gain (compared to a dipole), the main lobe of the radiation pattern becomes narrower.\n\nOutdoor antenna designs are often based on the Yagi-Uda antenna or log-periodic dipole array (LPDA). These are composed of multiple half-wave dipole elements, consisting of metal rods approximately half of the wavelength of the television signal, mounted in a line on a support boom. These act as resonators; the electric field of the incoming radio wave pushes the electrons in the rods back and forth, creating standing waves of oscillating voltage in the rods. The antenna can have a smaller or larger number of rod elements; in general the more elements the higher the gain and the more directional. Another design, used mainly for UHF reception, is the reflective array antenna, consisting of a vertical metal screen with multiple dipole elements mounted in front of it. \n\nThe television broadcast bands are too wide in frequency to be covered by a single antenna, so either separate antennas are used for the VHF and UHF bands, or a combination (combo) VHF/UHF antenna. A VHF/UHF antenna is really two antennas feeding the same feedline mounted on the same support boom. Longer elements which pick up VHF frequencies are located at the \"back\" of the boom and often function as a log-periodic antenna. Shorter elements which receive the UHF stations are located at the \"front\" of the boom and often function as a Yagi antenna. \n\nSince directional antennas must be pointed at the transmitting antenna, this is a problem when the television stations to be received are located in different directions. In this case two or more directional rooftop antennas each pointed at a different transmitter are often mounted on the same mast and connected to one receiver; for best performance filter or matching circuits are used to keep each antenna from degrading the performance of the others connected to the same transmission line. An alternative is to use a single antenna mounted on a \"rotator\", a remote servo system that rotates the antenna to a new direction when a dial next to the television is turned. \n\nSometimes television transmitters are deliberately located such that receivers in a given region need only receive transmissions in a relatively narrow band of the full UHF television spectrum and from the same direction hence allowing the use of a higher gain grouped aerial.\n\nAntennas are commonly placed on rooftops, and sometimes in attics. Placing an antenna indoors significantly attenuates the level of the available signal. Directional antennas must be pointed at the transmitter they are receiving; in most cases great accuracy is not needed. In a given region it is sometimes arranged that all television transmitters are located in roughly the same direction and use frequencies spaced closely enough that a single antenna suffices for all. A single transmitter location may transmit signals for several channels. CABD (communal antenna broadcast distribution) is a system installed inside a building to receive free-to-air TV/FM signals transmitted via radio frequencies and distribute them to the audience.\n\nAnalog television signals are susceptible to ghosting in the image, multiple closely spaced images giving the impression of blurred and repeated images of edges in the picture. This is due to the signal being reflected from nearby objects (buildings, tree, mountains); several copies of the signal, of different strengths and subject to different delays, are picked up. This is different for different transmissions. Careful positioning of the antenna can produce a compromise position which minimizes the ghosts on different channels. Ghosting is also possible if multiple antennas connected to the same receiver pick up the same station, especially if the lengths of the cables connecting them to the splitter/merger are different lengths or the antennas are too close together. Analog television is being replaced by digital, which is not subject to ghosting but is far more prone to interference; the same reflected signal that causes ghosting in an analog signal would produce no viewable content at all in digital.\n\nAerials are attached to roofs in various ways, usually on a pole to elevate it above the roof. This is generally sufficient in most areas. In some places, however, such as a deep valley or near taller structures, the antenna may need to be placed significantly higher, using a guyed mast or mast. The wire connecting the antenna to indoors is referred to as the \"\" or \"drop\", and the longer the downlead is, the greater the signal degradation in the wire. Certain cables may help reduce this tendency. \n\nThe higher the antenna is placed, the better it will perform. An antenna of higher gain will be able to receive weaker signals from its preferred direction. Intervening buildings, topographical features (mountains), and dense forest will weaken the signal; in many cases the signal will be reflected such that a usable signal is still available. There are physical dangers inherent to high or complex antennas, such as the structure falling or being destroyed by weather. There are also varying local ordinances which restrict and limit such things as the height of a structure without obtaining permits. For example, in the United States, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows any homeowner to install \"An antenna that is designed to receive local television broadcast signals\", but that \"masts higher than 12 feet above the roof-line may be subject to local permitting requirements.\"\n\nAs discussed previously, antennas may be placed indoors where signals are strong enough to overcome antenna shortcomings. The antenna is simply plugged into the television receiver and placed conveniently, often on the top of the receiver (\"set-top\"). Sometimes the position needs to be experimented with to get the best picture. Indoor antennas can also benefit from RF amplification, commonly called a TV booster. Reception form indoor antennas can be problematic in weak signal areas.\n\nSometimes it is desired not to put an antenna on the roof; in these cases, antennas designed for outdoor use are often mounted in the attic or loft, although antennas designed for attic use are also available. Putting an antenna indoors significantly decreases its performance due to lower elevation above ground level and intervening walls; however, in strong signal areas reception may be satisfactory. One layer of asphalt shingles, roof felt, and a plywood roof deck is considered to attenuate the signal to about half.\n\nIt is sometimes desired to receive signals from transmitters which are not in the same direction. This can be achieved, for one station at a time, by using a rotator operated by an electric motor to turn the antenna as desired. Alternatively, two or more antennas, each pointing at a desired transmitter and coupled by appropriate circuitry, can be used. To prevent the antennas from interfering with each other, the vertical spacing between the booms must be at least half the wavelength of the lowest frequency to be received (Distance=λ/2). The wavelength of 54 MHz (Channel 2) is 5.5 meters (λ x f = c) so the antennas must be a minimum of 2.25 metres, or about 89 inches apart. It is also important that the cables connecting the antennas to the signal splitter/merger be exactly the same length, to prevent phasing issues, which cause ghosting with analog reception. That is, the antennas might both pick up the same station; the signal from the one with the shorter cable will reach the receiver slightly sooner, supplying the receiver with two pictures slightly offset. There may be phasing issues even with the same length of down-lead cable. Bandpass filters or \"signal traps\" may help to reduce this problem.\n\nFor side-by-side placement of multiple antennas, as is common in a space of limited height such as an attic, they should be separated by at least one full wavelength of the lowest frequency to be received at their closest point.\n\nOften when multiple antennas are used, one is for a range of co-located stations and the other is for a single transmitter in a different direction.\n\n\n\n"}

The cathedral city is Kristiansand, Norway's fifth largest city. Kristiansand Cathedral serves as the seat of the presiding Bishop. The bishop since 2013 has been Stein Reinertsen. As of 1 January 2003, there were 347,324 members of the Church of Norway in the diocese.\n\nIn 1125, the southern part of the Ancient Diocese of Bergen was split off as the Ancient Diocese of Stavanger. This new diocese stretched from the coast of Haugesund in the west to Gjernestangen between Risør and Kragerø, later the border stretched to Eidanger in the east. Stavanger was the cathedral city. During the Protestant Reformation, Norway became a Lutheran nation, establishing the Church of Norway. The diocesan boundaries remained the same.\n\nOver time, however, the diocese was reduced in size. The parish of Eidfjord was transferred to the neighboring Diocese of Bjørgvin in 1630. The regions of Valdres and Hallingdal were transferred to the Diocese of Oslo in 1631, but in exchange, the Diocese of Oslo had to give the upper part of Telemark and transfer that to the Diocese of Stavanger.\n\nIn 1682 Christian V, King of Denmark-Norway, issued an order that the Bishop and the Prefect of the Diocese of Stavanger were to be moved to the Christianssand Cathedral, which had been consecrated in 1646 and which the King intended be perfect site for a new cathedral. The citizens of Stavanger protested, with the Prefect and the Bishop refusing to move and ignoring the order. It took two years before Christianssand was established as the new cathedral city. The diocese was renamed Diocese of Christianssand ().\n\nOn 1 January 1925, the Diocese of Kristiansand was divided and all of the diocese located in Rogaland county was moved to the newly re-established Diocese of Stavanger and the Stavanger Cathedral regained its place as the seat of a bishop. The Diocese of Agder continued to serve the counties of Aust-Agder, Vest-Agder, and Telemark, although its name \"Diocese of Agder\" continued to be used until 2005 when the name \"Telemark\" was added to fully reflect the areas included in the diocese.\n\nKristiansand Cathedral is the headquarters of the Diocese of Agder and Telemark and it is the main parish church for the city of Kristiansand. In 1682, there was a small church built of wood on site in Kristiansand. A new cathedral was built of stone and consecrated by Bishop Hans Munch in 1696, but burned down in 1734. The city's second cathedral was consecrated in 1738 by Bishop Jacob Kærup. This cathedral was destroyed in the city fire of 1880.\n\nThe present church is the third cathedral in the city and the fourth church in the town square in Kristiansand. The church was built after a drawing by the architect Henrik Thrap-Meyer. The church is described as neo-gothic style. The building is long and wide, and the tower is high. The Cathedral has a beautiful wooden ceiling and six beautiful stained glass windows with Biblical themes.\n\nIn order to exploit the ancient walls of the church that burned in 1880, the altar was placed against the west, while the churches generally tend to have the altar in the east. Building work was completed on 1 February 1885. The church was consecrated on 18 March 1885 with Johan M. Brun as acting bishop.\n\nThe diocese is administratively divided into 11 deaneries spread out over two counties. Each deanery corresponds to one or more municipalities in the diocese. Each municipality has its own church council (}) and municipalities are made up of one or more parishes, each of which may contain one or more congregations. See each municipality below for lists of churches and parishes within them.\n\n"}

{"id": "2240390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2240390", "title": "Swan River (Montana)", "text": "Swan River (Montana)\n\nThe Swan River is a long, north-flowing river in western Montana in the United States. The river drains a long isolated valley, known as the Swan Valley, between the Swan Range on the east and the Mission Mountains to the west.\n\nOn an 1884 Rand McNally map, the Swan River and Swan Lake are referred to as the Sweatinghouse River and the Sweatinghouse Lake. However, by 1895, most maps had adopted Swan, a name apparently proposed by early English hunters in the area and acknowledged by the locals, according to Ken Wolf’s 1980 Montana Magazine article “History of the Swan Valley.” Henry Coale quoted a local 1914 report that \"Twenty years ago Trumpeter Swans were common in Montana, and used regularly to winter here, but are now on the verge of extinction.\" He indicated that the Kootenai Indians generally reported that swans bred in the Flathead Valley up to the first immigration of whites in 1886... Coale described swans nesting historically at Lake Rodgers, at Swan Lake, and on the east side of Flathead Lake, and on the lakes which drain Clearwater, a branch of the Big Blackfoot River.\n\nThe Swan originates at Gray Wolf Lake in the Mission Mountains, at above sea level. Fed partly by melt from the Gray Wolf Glacier, the river descends through a short and steep canyon to Lindbergh Lake, at the base of the Mission Mountains. From there the river flows briefly east before turning north, passing Condon, flowing about to the northern end of the valley where it empties into Swan Lake. At the north end of the long lake, the river emerges into the Flathead Valley, where it turns abruptly west through a canyon, emptying into Flathead Lake at the town of Bigfork. Via Flathead Lake, it eventually drains to the Flathead River, a major tributary in the Columbia River system.\n\nThe river is fed by many tributaries descending from the mountains along both sides of its valley. On the west side, streams draining the Mission Mountains into the Swan River include Glacier, Elk, Cold, Jim, Piper, Woodward, Whitetail, and Porcupine Creeks. Eastern tributaries, flowing off the Swan Range, include Holland, Smith, Alder, Lion, Goat, Soup, and Lost Creeks. Below Swan Lake, the river is also joined by Bear and Mud Creeks from the east.\n\nMontana Highway 83 roughly parallels the river from the Bigfork area to near Lindbergh Lake.\n\nThe Swan River watershed drains and extends into parts of Missoula County, Lake County and a small portion of Flathead County. The glacial Swan Valley is considered Montana's most water-rich watershed, with over 4,000 lakes, ponds and wetlands that encompass about 16 percent of the total area. There are an estimated of rivers and streams in the watershed.\n\nThe watershed is very lightly populated with a density of slightly less than 1.6 people per square mile. The total human population, which is concentrated in the northern end of the valley near Bigfork, is estimated at 1,000. The main economic activity in the watershed is logging.\n\nGeologically, the Swan Valley forms a continuous trough with the valley drained by the Clearwater River, which flows south through Seeley Lake to join the Blackfoot River. The valleys of the two rivers are known locally as the Seeley-Swan.\n\nThere are two theories of the origin of the name \"Swan River\". In the 1880s Swan Lake was reported to have a large population of trumpeter swans, although none are present there today and contemporary claims remain anecdotal. Another possibility is that the river and lake were named after Emmett Swan, one of the first white settlers in Swan Valley.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service permitted commercial logging in the Swan Valley starting in 1907. Early logging activity in the valley was accompanied by attempts to float timber down the Swan River, which was difficult because of the river's narrow and winding course. As a result, most of the timber ended up piled on the banks and along sandbars, forming log jams that persist to this day.\n\nThe Swan Valley Massacre of 1908 was an altercation between native people of the Pend d'Oreilles tribe and a Montana game warden, in which four Native Americans and the warden were killed. It was the result of a dispute over tribal hunting rights outside of reservation boundaries, which the Montana government reputedly did not honor at the time.\n\nThe Bigfork Dam impounds the Swan River at the rapids about 1 mile (1.6 km) above its mouth, to generate about 4,000 kilowatts of hydroelectricity at peak load. The dam and reservoir are operated by PacifiCorp. Originally built in 1902, the dam was constructed with a fish ladder which proved ineffective, as a result isolating the Swan River's fish populations from Flathead Lake.\n\nThe stretch of the river between Bigfork Dam and Flathead Lake, known as the \"Wild Mile\" for its drop of over , is known for its extremely difficult Class V+ whitewater. The Bigfork Whitewater Festival takes place in mid-May each year along this section. Above Bigfork Dam, the river is calmer, but can be dangerous when running high in the spring. The river is also known for its log jams, which pose a significant hazard to boaters.\n\nThe river is also known for excellent fishing for bull trout. However, bull trout numbers have been declining since the introduction of lake trout, most likely around 1998 when anglers reported catching them in the river.\n\n\n"}

A versatile player able to play anywhere in defence, McNaughton was also used in a defensive midfield role. He began his career in the Scottish Premier League, playing for Aberdeen for six years. He joined Cardiff City in 2006, spending nine years at the Welsh side, making over 250 appearances. He had two loan spells at Bolton Wanderers before joining Wigan Athletic on a permanent basis in 2015. He retired from playing football in 2017, after a year with Inverness Caledonian Thistle, but reversed this decision in December 2017 after an injury crisis at Forfar Athletic, where he had joined as a coach the previous month.\n\nBeginning his career in the Scottish Premier League with Aberdeen after coming through the club's youth programme, where he won the Scottish Youth Cup in 2000–01, McNaughton was thrust into the first team at 18, making his debut on 5 October in a 2–1 win over St Mirren, and became a regular for the 2000–01 and 2001–02 seasons in a team containing lots of young players brought through the youth system like Darren Mackie, Russell Anderson and Darren Young. A knee injury sustained in 2002 kept him out for 12 weeks and on his return McNaughton struggled to return to form. It wasn't until new Aberdeen manager Jimmy Calderwood arrived, that he managed to recover his previous form.\n\nDuring the 2005–06 season, McNaughton was linked with moves to Celtic and Fulham, but nothing came of either and he remained at Pittodrie.\n\nOn 26 May 2006, it was announced that he would be joining Football League Championship side Cardiff City on a free transfer. McNaughton quickly became an important part of manager Dave Jones's plans as he played in the left full-back position, and his form once again earned him a recall to the Scottish national team, although injury robbed him of the chance to take his place in the squad. During his second season at Cardiff, having switched to right-back, McNaughton played in all six matches of the club's run to the 2008 FA Cup Final, including scoring his first goal for the club on 27 January 2008 with a 20-yard volley in a 2–1 victory over Hereford United in the fourth round. His first league goal came just a few months later when he scored on the final day of the season against Barnsley in a 3–0 win.\n\nThe start of the 2008–09 season saw McNaughton his 100th appearance for the club when he played against Watford on 21 October.\n\nDuring a pre-season friendly against Celtic on 22 July 2009 he suffered an ankle injury which kept him out for the opening two months of the season. After appearing for the club's reserve side, he returned to the first team on 17 October 2009 as an unused substitute during a 1–1 draw with Crystal Palace but suffered a recurrence of the injury kept him out until 17 November 2009 when he played 45 minutes of a reserve team game against Hereford United. He returned to the line-up on 21 November 2009 against Barnsley, but was taken off in the 21st minute for Paul Quinn with a back injury. On 23 November McNaughton was sent to have a scan on the back injury, which the club's medical staff believed to have caused the problem and resulted in him being out for two weeks. On 5 December 2009 McNaughton played his first 90 minutes of the season in a 1–0 win over Preston North End. The next season his injury worries ceded and he has played in every league up to and including the game against Barnsley. McNaughton was Cardiff's most consistent defender throughout the 2010–11 season, and won the Player of the Year award.\n\nOn 2 May 2011, McNaughton was involved in an incident where he collided with assistant referee Sian Massey. He was later cleared when the FA ruled the incident an accident though it attracted hits and comments on YouTube, with some suggesting the player had deliberately barged into the official. Also McNaughton had captained the side for the first time in their 3–0 loss to Reading in their play-off second leg, on 17 May.\n\nIn 2011–12, McNaughton was named as stand-in captain in Mark Hudson's absence starting on 22 November against Coventry City. He went on to make three further appearances as captain, during which time he made his two hundredth league appearance for Cardiff in a 1–0 win over Nottingham Forest on 26 November 2011. He also played a part in the club's League Cup run to their first ever final, which they lost 3–2 on penalties to Liverpool.\n\nMcNaughton's 400th league appearance for Cardiff came in a goalless draw at Brighton & Hove Albion on 21 August 2012. McNaughton started over half of City's fixtures in 2012–13, as Cardiff finally achieved promotion to the Premier League. With his contract expiring during the close-season, the club has confirmed that McNaughton has been offered a new deal. On 5 July 2013 it was announced on the official Cardiff City website that McNaughton had signed a new one-year contract extension with the Bluebirds. On 7 March 2014, McNaughton signed a new one-year contract with the \"Bluebirds\".\n\nOn 5 May 2015, it was announced after nine years for playing for Cardiff City, McNaughton was to be released at the end of the season upon his contract expiry.\n\nOn 27 September 2013, McNaughton joined Bolton on a 28-day emergency loan deal. He made his first appearance for Wanderers four days later in a goalless draw with local rivals Blackpool at Bloomfield Road. After becoming the club's first choice right-back during his stay with Bolton, he scored his first goal for the club in the 1–1 draw with Charlton Athletic on 21 December 2013, this was his first goal in the League since scoring for Cardiff against Barnsley in May 2008.\n\nHe returned to Bolton on loan in July 2014.\n\nOn 4 August 2015, McNaughton joined League One side Wigan Athletic on a one-year deal.\n\nMcNaughton signed for Inverness Caledonian Thistle during the 2016 close season. In August 2016, McNaughton suffered an achilles injury. He retired from football in July 2017, aged 34.\n\nMcNaughton's first call-up for the Scotland squad came in 2002 when he was told by manager Berti Vogts that, at the age of 19, he would earn his first cap in a match against France. However, before the match Vogts told the media in a press conference that McNaughton would not be playing as Vogts deemed he was too nervous, despite not telling McNaughton himself. Instead his first cap came against Nigeria in Scotland's next match.\n\nIn his second appearance he was hauled off at half-time in a friendly against Denmark. In 2007 McNaughton claimed that Vogts had set his career back by two years with his actions during that time. His move to Cardiff reignited his international career, winning his fourth cap in a match against Czech Republic in May 2008 and being called-up several times.\n\nIn November 2017, McNaughton joined Forfar Athletic as first-team coach, later registering himself as a player after an injury crisis at the club. He made his début for Forfar in a 0–2 defeat to Alloa Athletic on 9 December 2017. In August 2017, McNaughton left his playing role at Forfar and signed for SJFA East Super League side, Kirriemuir Thistle, his contract, allowed him to keep his Assistant Manager role at Forfar.\n\nAs of April 2020, McNaughton was working for Dundee as a youth team coach.\n"}

He was prime minister of Greece from 3 September 1843 to 16 February 1844. Some military leaders of the revolution (Makriyannis) gave him the ironic nickname of \"Conte Lalas'\" due to his injury during the Battle of Lalas.\n\nBorn in 1790 in Argostoli he belonged to the historical Metaxas family, which originated in Constantinople and moved to Kefalonia in the 15th century. He was the second son of Petrod Metaxas and Violeta Loverdou and had three brothers, Anastasios, Paisios and Ioannis. Konstantinos Metaxas was his cousin. Although he did not receive any special education, other than Greek he was fluent in Italian and French and was a scholar of ancient Greek history. A few years before the Greek Revolution he married Marietta Vourvachi, sister of a Greek officer in the French army, Dionysios, with whom he had two sons (Spyros and Petros) and two daughters. In pre-revolutionary years, he worked as a solicitor.\n\nHe was initiated into Filiki Eteria. When the revolution was declared, he rushed to Peloponnese and established, along with his brother Anastasios and his cousin Konstantinos, a military contingent of 350 men from Kefalonia equipped with two cannons, contribution of Evangelinos Panas. Among the leaders were Victor Gerasimos Fokas, Konstantinos Fokas Karandinos and others. Claiming that they were chasing pirates, they boarded a ship belonged to Anastasios and Fokas Theodoratou brothers, which was equipped with 18 cannons, 50 sailors and 50 gunmen. They disembarked in early May 1821 in Glarentza and marched to Manolada. There, they were joined by other military captains (Vilaetis, Sisinis and Plapoutas) and then marched to Lalas, which was the foothold of notorious Albanian fighters. During the battles that took place in the region and until 13 June, when all the people from Lalas had to resort to Patra, Metaxas was among the noteworthy. He even got wounded in both hands by bullets. Later, after Demetrios Ypsilantis' suggestion, he was sent, along with the rest of the army, to Patra. Soon, due to his injury, he was only active in the political part of the revolution.\n\nOn 25 May 1822, in a unanimous decision, the \"Executive Body\" passed an act by which Metaxas was naturalized as a Greek Peloponnese citizen for his service to his country. He was appointed Minister of Police in 1822, and Minister of War in April 1826. He took part in, and also organized the defense during, the Battle of the Lerna Mills.\n\nHe was a member of the National Assembly of Argos and member of the Provisional Government. Along with Georgios Mavromichalis and Germanos III of Old Patras, he was sent by the Government to Verona in search for financial resources but also to persuade the Great Powers to not act against Greece, in which he succeeded with the help of his friend Ioannis Kapodistrias.\n\nAndreas Metaxas was the prime mover behind Ioannis Kapodistrias' election. He was a devout supporter of Kapodistrias and remained his faithful ally to the end. In return Kapodistrias honored him by promoting him to high dignities. On his own initiative, he joined the \"Panellinion\", was appointed head of the army and Emergency Commissioner of the Peloponnese. From this position Metaxas mainly helped organizing the tactical army. After the assassination of Kapodistrias in 1831, although pro-Russian, Metaxas opposed the election of Augustine Kapodistrias which he found disastrous. Nevertheless, he kept away from Ioannis Kolettis' disruptive tendencies. Despite that, he remained a member of the provisional government until the arrival of King Otto.\n\nDuring the Regency he was appointed Prefect of Laconia, and later, in October 1835, member of the Council of State. Soon, however, he was exiled to Marseilles by the Regency for his liberal views. He was later called back and sent to Spain as ambassador of Greece. After his return to Greece in 1839, he was re-appointed to the State Council. He served as Minister for Military Affairs in the government of Alexandros Mavrokordatos during July and August 1841. He took over the leadership of the Russian Party after Theodoros Kolokotronis' death.\n\nFollowing the 3 September 1843 Revolution, he received a mandate by Otto to form a government to prepare elections for a constitutional assembly. A few days later, under the threat that he would resign unless his proposal was accepted, he managed to convince the cabinet to broaden the government with the participation of Alexandros Mavrokordatos and Ioannis Kolettis, leaders of the English and French party respectively. Metaxas was the first government leader in the political history of Greece who was named \"prime minister\".\n\nDuring his premiership, Metaxas managed to maintain order and conduct elections in order to form the First National Assembly. He was elected Honorary Vice-President in five regions and participated in its actions. In next year's elections for the First Period (1844–1845), he was elected Attica MP. He was appointed Minister of Finance in Kolettis' government, a position he held from August 1844 until August 1845, when he resigned after Kolettis' effort to overthrow the constitution. He served as a senator during the years 1846 and 1847 and from 1850 until 1859 as an Attica MP. In 1850, he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General and was decorated by King Otto with the Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer. On 15 September of the same year, he was sent to Istanbul as ambassador of Greece.\n\nHe resigned on 10 March 1854, after the start of the Crimean War, and returned to Athens where he retired from politics. It appears that he secretly supported the revolt movement of Thessaly and Epirus and changed the King's hasty decision to get involved, when he secretly rushed to the palace and convinced him not to go there, thus preventing any suffering for Greece. Shortly before his death, Otto assigned him to form a government but he refused.\n\nAndreas Metaxas also served as president of the Society for the Promotion of Education and Learning and many charity foundations. Throughout his life he was brave, honest, patriotic and had a strong character. He died in Athens in September 1860.\n"}

{"id": "2240422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2240422", "title": "Paul Brickhill", "text": "Paul Brickhill\n\nPaul Chester Jerome Brickhill (20 December 191623 April 1991) was an Australian fighter pilot, prisoner of war, and author who wrote \"The Great Escape\", \"The Dam Busters\", and \"Reach for the Sky\".\n\nBrickhill was born in Melbourne, Victoria to journalist George Russell Brickhill (1879–1964) and Izitella Victoria Brickhill (née Bradshaw). He was the third son of the couple's five children, the others being Russell (1911–2002), Ayde Geoffrey (1914– ), Lloyd (1918–2011), and Clive (1923–2009). When Brickhill was 11 the family moved to Sydney, where he was educated at North Sydney Boys High School. A classmate, and friend, was actor Peter Finch. \n\nBrickhill left school in 1931 as his father had been made redundant as a result of the Depression. While his other brothers continued with their education it was necessary for Brickhill, who was regarded as the least academic of the children, to get a job to assist his older brother Russell in bringing money into the family. He was sacked from his first two jobs due to his stutter. He then got a job as office boy and then lift boy at the Adelaide Steamship Company. That job did not last long, as Peter Finch, who was by now working as a copy boy, was able to convince a news editor at \"The Sun\" to interview Brickhill in 1932. Brickhill was hired as a copy boy, and within a year was promoted to cadet journalist. Within a few years he had worked his way up to journalist, and by 1940 was a sub-editor.\n\nBrickhill was initially unimpressed by war fever, until the shock of the invasion of France and subsequent withdrawal from Dunkirk, coupled with boredom with his deskbound sub-editor job, caused him to enlist on 6 January 1941 with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).\nHis flight training commenced in March 1941 at the Number 8 Elementary Flying Training School at Narrandera, New South Wales as undertaken in Australia \nUnder the Empire Air Training Scheme. Brickhill undertook advanced training as a fighter pilot in Canada and the United Kingdom before being assigned to No. 92 Squadron RAF, a unit equipped with Spitfires and part of the Desert Air Force in North Africa. \n\nOn 17 March 1943, he was shot down over Tunisia and became a prisoner of war. He was flown to Italy on 23 March, then sent by train to Germany. After initially being held at the Dulag Luft at Oberursel, a central receiving and interrogation station for captured enemy airman for the Luftwaffe, he was sent to Stalag Luft III, in Lower Silesia, 150 km southeast of Berlin, arriving there on 4 April 1943.\nBrickhill became involved with organizing the camp's escape, initially as a lookout or \"stooge\", before volunteering to work as a digger on the \"Tom\" tunnel\". He developed claustrophobia, and as a result was eventually reassigned and put in charge of security for the forgers. Because of his claustrophobia and the risk that he would panic and block the escape of others behind him, he was not allowed to take part in the mass escape attempt, which is known as \"The Great Escape\".\n\nFollowing the announcement of the murder of the escapees who had been recaptured following the Great Escape, Brickhill became determined to document the event. Discussing the subject with fellow prisoner Conrad Norton, they identified that many of their fellow prisoners had other tales of daring escapes, and that they could provide the possibility of publishing a book following the end of the war. As Brickhill had been involved in \"The Great Escape\", he concentrated on that story, while Norton collected individual tales. As prisoners were forbidden from writing anything other than letters and postcards, they collected every piece of paper they could find and, writing in as small a hand as possible, they collected stories and hid them from the guards. \n\nOn D-Day, while still in captivity, Brickhill heard on German radio of two huge Allied armadas heading towards Cap d'Antifer and Calais. These were diversions created by No. 617 Squadron RAF to fool the Germans, however, a fact he learned months later.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, while the terms of his enlistment with the RAAF had been that he had to serve for 12 months following the cessation of hostilities, Brickhill was granted six months' leave without pay. During his leave he returned to journalism, working as a London-based correspondent for Associated Newspapers. Meanwhile, outside of working hours he had typed up his and Norton's stories and selected David Higham as their literary agent. With Higham's help the manuscript was accepted by Faber & Faber and published as \"Escape to Danger\" in 1946.\n\nAfter working for Associated Newspapers for a period, Brickhill returned to Australia, taking a job as a sub-editor at \"The Sun\" newspaper in Sydney, Australia.\n\nBrickhill and Norton had agreed that each would retain the copyright to the chapters that they had written for \"Escape to Danger\". As a result, while awaiting for sufficient stocks of paper to be obtained to print the book, Brickhill was able to sell a condensed version of his chapter on the Great Escape to several newspapers in Australia.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, John Nerney, head of the Air Historical Branch of the British Air Ministry identified the need for a history of 617 Squadron. While trying to find a suitable author he discussed the issue with John Pudney, who was an editor at \"News Review\". Pudney had liked \"Escape to Danger\" and suggested that Brickhill be considered.\n\nFollowing up Pudney's recommendation, Nerney approached Brickhill in February 1949, who jumped at the offer. While doing all it could to assist his research the Air Ministry could only provide Brickhill with a small honorarium, and no guarantee of publication other than as a government produced publication. In an attempt to obtain an advance which would pay enough for him to leave his current job as a sub-editor at \"The Sun\" and relocate to England Brickhill approached a number of Australian publishers to see if they were interested in an Australian edition of the book. None was interested so Brickhill was forced to decline Nerney's offer.\nAt the same time Brickhill had been approached by John Pudney who had recently joined London based publisher Evans Brothers as an editor with a proposal to write a book on the Stalag Luft 3 mass escape. This was eventually to be published as \"The Great Escape\".\nWith the advance that Evans Brothers offered Brickhill he left his job and sailed to England in May 1949.\n\nOnce in England Brickhill asked the RAF about the status of the proposed history of 617 squadron, offering his services if they were still required. As the RAF had made no further progress in finding an alternative author, his offer was accepted.\nBrickhill approached Evans Brothers about an advance for the proposed book on 617 Squadron, but they were not interested in providing any advance until they saw a manuscript. \nAlready working on \"The Great Escape\", Brickhill also commenced simultaneous work on the 617 squadron history.\n\n\"The Great Escape\" was published in 1950 and brought the incident to wide public attention. \n\nThe history of 617 Squadron and in particular its involvement in Operation \"Chastise\" and the destruction of dams in the Ruhr valley was published in 1951 as \"The Dam Busters\", which sold over one million copies in its first 50 years.\n\nFollowing the success of \"The Dam Busters\" Robert Clark the head of production at Associated British Picture Corporation approached Brickhill about acquiring the screen rights to the book. The company's production manager was of the opinion that there were too many people and raids involved, and that they would not be able to film the book in its entirety. As a result, he requested that Brickhill provide a condensed film treatment. Brickhill agree to do it without payment in the hope of selling the screen rights. To assist, Clark teamed him up with Walter Mycroft who was the company's Director of Production. Brickhill decided to concentrate the film treatment on Operation Chastise, and ignore the later raids.\n\nAssociated agreed with Brickhill on the film rights in December 1952 for what is believed to have been ₤5,000.\n\nThe subsequent film was released in 1954 as \"The Dam Busters\".\n\nAfter reading \"The Dam Busters\", Battle of Britain ace Douglas Bader approached Brickhill in 1951 about collaborating on his biography. Brickhill agreed to undertake the project.\n\nAfter approaching several publishers about the proposed biography Brickhill's agent found that William Collins and Sons were prepared to offer the best terms, leading Brickhill to sign with them. However Brickhill felt guilty about not signing with John Pudney and Evans Brothers, who had previously been so supportive of him. He consequently offered to write an anthology of escape stories for them, which they eventually published as \"Escape – Or Die\".\n\nThe resulting biography of Bader was published in 1954 as \"Reach for the Sky\". In the first few months alone, 172,000 copies were sold. The initial print run of 300,000 quickly sold out, as the biography became the biggest-selling hardback in post-war Britain.\n\nThe book was subsequently adapted for the screen and released in 1956 as a feature film. Starring Kenneth More as Bader, it topped the box office in Britain that year.\n\nBrickhill spent the rest of his life working on several unfinished film screenplays, novels and biographies, but was never able to repeat his successes of 1949 to 1954.\n\nIn 1969 he returned to live permanently in Australia. Brickhill died in Sydney, New South Wales on 23 April 1991 aged 74. See also John Ramsland's update.\n\nAfter first meeting her while travelling by ship from Australia to England in 1949, the 33-year-old Brickhill married 21-year-old Margot Slater, also an Australian, in St. Michael's Church, Chester Square, Chester Square, Pimlico on 22 April 1950. They divorced on 20 July 1964 after a tempestuous marriage. Margot later married Devon Minchin.\n\nPaul and Margot Brickhill had two children: Timothy Paul (14 April 1954– ) and Tempe Melinda (August 1957– ). After working as a fashion model Tempe became manager of Issey Miyake London, CEO of Issey Miyake Europe and a director of Fédération Française de la Couture.\n\nHis life was the subject of a 2016 biography, \"The Hero Maker: A Biography of Paul Brickhill\", by Stephen Dando-Collins and \"Flying into Danger: The Paul Brickhill Story\" by John Ramsland.\n\nBrickill wrote the following books:\n\nThree books by Brickhill were made into feature films: \"The Dam Busters\" (1955), \"Reach for the Sky - The story of Douglas Bader\" (1956), and \"The Great Escape\" (1963).\n\n\"Deadline\" became an episode of the \"Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre\" anthology series entitled \"War of Nerves\" that was first broadcast on 5 January 1964.\n\n\n"}

He left Jordan after thousands of Palestinians were killed or expelled in the wake of an attempted coup against King Hussein, in Black September.\n\nIn 1966, he earned his high school diploma after attending al-Ra'i al-Saleh High School in Beirut. He studied History at the Lebanese University and graduated in 1971. In 1972, he received his PhD in Social History at the University of Paris.\n\nElias Khoury is married and has children. He became a successful novelist with numerous published novels. He believes that one should never limit himself as each setback may seem as the end in life. In an interview with \"Al-Nahar Al-Arabi wal Dowali,\" \"Whenever I write new novels, I start from scratch as if I never wrote before.\"\n\nIn 1972, Khoury joined and became a member of the editorial board of the journal \"Mawaqif\". From 1975 to 1979, Khoury was editor of \"Shu'un Filastinia\" (\"Palestinian Affairs Magazine\"), collaborating with Mahmoud Darwish. Between 1980 and 1985, Khoury worked as an editor of the series \"Thakirat Al-Shu'ub\" published by the \"Arab Research Foundation\" in Beirut. From 1981 to 1982, he was editorial director of \"Al-Karmel Magazine\". From 1983 to 1990, he was the editorial director of the cultural section of Al-Safir. Khoury also worked as the technical director of \"Beirut Theater\" from 1992 to 1998, and a co-director in \"September Festiva\"l for contemporary arts.\n\nKhoury published his first novel in 1975, \"An 'ilaqat al-da'ira.\" It was followed in 1977 by \"The Little Mountain\", set during the Lebanese civil war, a conflict which Khoury initially thought would be a catalyst for progressive change. Other works include \"The Journey of Little Gandhi,\" about a rural immigrant to Beirut who lives through the events of the civil war, and \"Gate of the Sun\" (2000).\n\n\"Gate of the Sun\" is an epic re-telling of the life of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon since the 1948 Palestinian exodus, which also addresses the ideas of memory, truth, and storytelling. The book was adapted as a film of the same name by Egyptian director Yousry Nasrallah (2002).\n\nIn an interview by the Israeli mainstream daily \"Yediot Aharonot,\" after the publication of the Hebrew translation of \"Gate of the Sun\", Khoury remarked:\"When I was working on this book, I discovered that the \"other\" is the mirror of the I. And given that I am writing about half a century of Palestinian experience, it is impossible to read this experience otherwise than in the mirror of the Israeli \"other.\" Therefore, when I was writing this novel, I put a lot of effort into trying to take apart not only the Palestinian stereotype but also the Israeli stereotype as it appears in Arab literature and especially in the Palestinian literature of Ghassan Kanafani, for example, or even of Emil Habibi. The Israeli is not only the policeman or the occupier, he is the \"other,\" who also has a human experience, and we need to read this experience. Our reading of their experience is a mirror to our reading of the Palestinian experience.\" Khoury's novel, \"Yalo\" (2002, and translated into English in 2008 for US publication by American Peter Theroux), depicted a former militiaman accused of crimes during Lebanon's civil war. He described the use of torture in the Lebanese judicial system. The title refers to the name of a Palestinian Arab village that was destroyed and in territory annexed by Israel during the 1967 war. All the inhabitants were expelled and most went to Jordan.\n\nKhoury is known for being a prolific writer, but his novels are not so lengthy, supposedly 110-220 pages. Only \"Gate of the Sun\" was an exception, its number of pages was less than the others.\n\nKhoury's novels are notable for their complex approach to political themes and fundamental questions of human behavior. His narrative technique often involves an interior monologue, at times approaching a stream of consciousness. In recent works he has tended to use a considerable element of colloquial Arabic, although the language of his novels remains primarily Modern Standard Arabic, also called Fusha.This use of dialect forms adds to the credibility and immediacy of the narrative voice. While use of dialect in dialogue is relatively common in modern Arabic literature (for example, in the work of Yusuf Idris), Khoury also uses it in the main narrative. This is unusual in contemporary literature and has become part of the narrative technique of his works, and he says in this regard:\"As long as the official, written language is not opened to the spoken language it is a total repression because it means that the spoken, social experience is marginalised.\"\n\nKhoury's works have been translated and published internationally in Catalan, Dutch, English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Portuguese, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish.\n\nHe has taught at New York University, University of Houston, Berkeley College, The University of Chicago, Columbia University, Georgetown University, the University of Minnesota, and Princeton University in the United States. He also taught at the University of Poitiers in France, the University of London in the U.K, the University of Berlin in Germany, and the University of Zurich in Switzerland. In his home country Lebanon, he taught at the American University of Beirut, the Lebanese American University, and the Lebanese University.\n\nIn 2006, Elias Khoury was teaching as a visiting professor for Modern Arabic Literature and Comparative Literature at New York University.\n\n\n\"Al-Mulhaq,\" under Khoury's editorship, became the \"tribune of opposition\" to controversial aspects of the post-Civil War reconstruction of Beirut led by businessman and politician Rafiq al-Hariri.\n\nNovels\n\nStory groups\n\nCriticism\n\nPlays\n\nScreenplays\n"}

{"id": "2240460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2240460", "title": "Kenny Miller", "text": "Kenny Miller\n\nKenneth Miller (born 23 December 1979) is a Scottish professional football coach and former player, who is currently an assistant coach at Newcastle Jets. Miller, who played as a striker, is one of only five post-war players to have played for both Rangers and Celtic. He was known as a versatile and pacy striker who was skilled with headers and could play as a supporting or centre-forward.\n\nMiller began his career at Hibernian before moving on to Rangers then to the English side Wolverhampton Wanderers, where he won his first career honour, the 2003 First Division play-off final. After five seasons with Wolverhampton, Miller returned to Scotland, signing for the other side of the Old Firm – Celtic. He finished his only full season at Celtic with SPL and Scottish Cup winners medals.\n\nAfter one season with Derby County, he returned to Scotland and to Rangers, winning back-to-back SPL titles, the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup in his two full seasons. He moved to Turkish club Bursaspor in January 2011, but returned to the UK later that year, signing for Cardiff City. After one season with Cardiff, Miller played in Major League Soccer for Vancouver Whitecaps FC. He had a third spell with Rangers between 2014 and 2018. After a very brief spell as player/manager of Livingston, Miller played for Dundee and Partick Thistle.\n\nMiller was a regular Scotland international player from his debut in 2001 until his retirement in 2013. He often played as an isolated lone striker, scoring 18 goals in 69 appearances.\n\nMiller grew up in Musselburgh and got his big break when he signed for local side Hibernian, and he made his debut against Motherwell in the 1997–98 season. A loan spell at Stenhousemuir saw Miller score five doubles—10 goals—in 13 league and Scottish Cup games, before he returned to Hibernian to establish himself as a regular player. Highlights of his four years at the club included being the club's top scorer in season 1999–2000 and receiving the Scottish PFA Young Player of the Year award in 2000.\n\nMiller signed for Rangers at a cost of £2 million on 26 June 2000, signing a five-year contract. He made his debut in a 4–1 win over FBK Kaunas on 26 July during a Champions League qualifier. His first goal came on 5 August 2000 during a league match away to Kilmarnock, scoring the third in a 4–2 win.\n\nThree months later, Miller netted five goals (a Scottish Premier League record) during a 7–1 win against St Mirren. More goals followed against AS Monaco and Aberdeen and helped him to a tally of ten goals from just fourteen games, all coming before the turn of the year. Chances became limited thereafter and, as the season came to a close, he netted only once more against Brechin City in a Scottish Cup match on 27 January 2001. This proved to be his final strike that season. Miller had made a total of 38 appearances and scored 11 goals for Rangers.\n\nIn September 2001, Miller went to Wolverhampton Wanderers on a three-month loan, scoring against Gillingham and Walsall. However, after just five appearances, Miller broke his collarbone in a fall. In December 2001, Wolves secured him on a permanent transfer at a cost of £3 million, on a four-and-a-half-year deal.\n\nIn 2002–03 Miller found himself back in the Wolves starting 11, but he had only managed six goals in 19 starts. However, during the final six months of the season he scored 18 goals in his final 24 appearances of that campaign, including in the play-off final that saw the club win promotion.\n\nIn the 2003–04 season, Miller started off in the physiotherapy room; it was not until October that he made his first Premier League start. He played in a 4–5–1 formation for the following few months, situated in a right-wing role. This led to frustration on Miller's part, and his only goals up until January came in the League Cup, against Burnley, and a double against Kidderminster Harriers in the FA Cup on 13 January. The following Saturday, Wolves beat Manchester United 1–0 with Miller scoring the winner in the 65th minute. Miller then grabbed a last minute equaliser against Liverpool the following Wednesday. Despite starting many games from then on in a striker's role, those were Miller's only Premier League goals and Wolves were relegated at the end of the season.\n\nIn the summer of 2004, Miller handed in a transfer request over lack of first team opportunities. Despite having a tense relationship with the Wolves manager, Dave Jones, he started the 2004–05 season in good form for the club scoring seven goals in his first 10 games at Wolves. The appointment of Glenn Hoddle signalled a new start for Miller, and he formed a successful partnership with Carl Cort, ending the 2004–05 season with 20 goals.\n\nIn summer 2005, his form attracted the attention of the newly promoted Premier League team Sunderland, but Wolves rejected their £1m and £1.2m offers and Miller began the new season as a Wolves player. He was subject of further transfer bid in the January transfer window, however Wolves rejected a £1.5m offer for Miller from Sheffield United after the player stated he was not interested in the move. Despite only playing in his natural position on few occasions, Miller still ended the season as top scorer, with 12 goals – the third time in Wolves' last three Championship campaigns. Miller played 191 games and scored 63 goals during his five years with the club.\n\nWhen Miller's contract expired at the end of that season, he transferred to Celtic for free under the Bosman ruling. He signed a pre-contract agreement in January after refusing to sign a new deal at Wolves a month earlier. Miller became only the third player since World War II to have played for both sides of the Old Firm – following Alfie Conn and Maurice Johnston.\n\nMiller was handed the number nine jersey upon his arrival at Celtic. He endured a difficult start at the club, getting sent off in a pre-season friendly with D.C. United and failing to score in his first nine games. He finally netted his first goal, against Old Firm rivals and former employers Rangers at Celtic Park in September 2006. He proceeded to score in Celtic's 1–0 Champions League win against Copenhagen from the penalty spot and netted two in the 3–0 win over Benfica. By scoring in the 2006–07 competition, Miller became the first player to score goals in the Champions League proper for both Rangers and Celtic. However, he ended the season with only four league goals. He did play in the Scottish Cup final, before being substituted because of an injury. Despite hints from the player himself that he would leave to get more first-team opportunities, Miller vowed to stay at the club and fight for his place in the team. Miller scored his first goal in his first appearance of the 2007–08 season in a 4–1 victory over Falkirk and added to his collection the following week with a brace against Aberdeen. He netted 11 goals in total for the club in 46 appearances.\n\nMiller signed a three-year deal with newly promoted Premier League club Derby County on 31 August 2007 for an undisclosed fee, later confirmed by Derby County manager Paul Jewell to be close to £2.25m. Miller started well at his new club, scoring in his first two home matches, including the winner on his league debut for the \"Rams\" against Newcastle United in a 1–0 win on 17 September, a strike which won the club's Goal of the Season award. However, following this initial success Miller netted just twice in his next 28 league fixtures. After less than seven months at the club and with Derby looking likely candidates for relegation, Miller expressed a desire to move – return to Rangers being a possible destination, although manager Jewell insisted any move would have to be financially fair for Derby.\n\nA fee of £2 million was agreed between Rangers and Derby allowing Miller to enter into discussions about a transfer back to Ibrox on 10 June 2008. The deal was completed on 13 June. Miller's return means he is the only player in the modern era to cross the Old Firm divide twice, and only the second in history, the first being Tom Dunbar in the 1890s.\n\nMiller made his second debut for the club on 30 July 2008 in a Champions League qualifier against FBK Kaunas, who he played during his first Rangers debut. He netted a brace in the first Old Firm game of the season on 31 August 2008. He followed this up with a further two goals against former employers Hibernian at Easter Road a month later. Miller played in the League Cup Final in March 2009 but Rangers lost the match 2–0 to Celtic after extra time. However, he won a league winners medal with Rangers on the final day of the season and followed it up with a Scottish Cup winners medal.\n\nMiller had an injury-ridden start to the 2009–10 season, but gave a Man of the Match performance in the first Old Firm game of the season, scoring both of Rangers' goals in a 2–1 win.\nIn March 2010, he scored the winning goal in the League Cup Final against St Mirren, after Rangers had been reduced to nine men.\n\nMiller was handed the number 9 shirt after Kris Boyd moved to Middlesbrough. He scored his second Rangers hat-trick against former club Hibernian on 22 August 2010; his first was when he scored five against St Mirren in November 2000. Miller claimed to be in \"the form of his career\" after notching up ten goals in the first six league matches of the 2010–11 season. Miller scored twice in the first Old Firm derby of the season.\n\nMiller had scored 22 goals by early January, when Rangers accepted an offer of £700,000 from Birmingham City. A lower offer by Turkish club Bursaspor was later agreed, however. Miller had scored for Rangers against Bursaspor earlier that season in the Champions League. Despite leaving Rangers during the middle of the season, he finished the season as top goalscorer in the SPL.\n\nOn 21 January 2011, Miller officially signed for Bursaspor for £400,000 on a two-and-a-half-year contract. He made his debut for the Turkish side two days later in a goalless draw with Konyaspor when he played the last 25 minutes after replacing Pablo Batalla. Kenny scored on his first start for Bursaspor in a 2–0 win over Galatasaray. He followed this up with a further two goals in his next game against Sivasspor, netting an 88th-minute winner. Miller scored five goals in 15 appearances for the club.\n\nMiller failed to settle in Turkey, however, and he asked Bursaspor to consider selling him. Bursaspor then accepted an offer from Cardiff City. Rangers also made an offer for Miller, but this was rejected by Bursaspor.\n\nMiller signed for Cardiff City on 26 July 2011, for a reported transfer fee of £870,000. Miller scored his first goal in the 91st minute of his debut match against West Ham United in the season opener. Miller returned to the score sheet, on 28 September, with a brace in a 2–1 win over Southampton. However, Miller suffered a groin injury in 10 minutes the following game against Hull City, which kept him out of two Scotland games and two Championship matches, where Cardiff only gained a point. On 19 October, manager Malky Mackay confirmed that Miller was fit and ready to make a return against Barnsley. Miller did return this match and scored the opener, but only lasted 30 minutes in the match after suffering a head injury. Miller scored in 1–0 victories against Birmingham City and Nottingham Forest in December. Cardiff reached the 2012 Football League Cup Final, but Miller missed a chance to score late in extra time. He then missed his penalty kick as Cardiff lost to Liverpool in a penalty shootout. He struggled for form later in the 2011–12 season, scoring only once in 22 appearances.\n\nMiller signed with Vancouver Whitecaps FC of Major League Soccer on 16 July 2012. Six days later, he made his debut in a 2–1 home win over the San Jose Earthquakes, playing the last 12 minutes in place of Darren Mattocks. He scored his first goal for the Whitecaps on 25 August 2012 against the Portland Timbers in a 2–1 loss. He signed an extension in July 2013 to take him through June 2014 with the club, however, the two sides mutually agreed to terminate the remaining two months in his contract on 4 May 2014.\n\nOn 4 June 2014, Miller signed for Rangers on a one-year deal. He made his third debut against Hibernian in a Challenge Cup tie on 5 August and scored his first goal since his return to the club on 30 August against Queen of the South. Miller scored nine times in 41 appearances in 2014–15, as Rangers failed to win promotion to the top flight.\n\nMiller signed another one-year extension with Rangers in November 2015. On 2 January 2016, Miller became Rangers' oldest ever player to score a hat-trick in a 6–0 win over Dumbarton. Five goals in four league games during January 2016 saw Miller win the Scottish Championship player of the month award. He played and scored in the 2016 Scottish Challenge Cup Final, as Rangers beat Peterhead 4–0, only five days after Rangers had secured the Scottish Championship trophy. Miller ended the 2015–16 season with 21 goals, scoring his final goal in the 2016 Scottish Cup Final which Rangers lost 3–2 to Hibernian, giving Hibernian their first Scottish Cup win since the 1901–02 Scottish Cup.\n\nDuring the 2016–17 season, Miller scored his 100th goal for Rangers, over three spells, in a Scottish Premiership match against Inverness CT. It was strike which was nominated for the SPFL's and the club's goal of the month awards for October, winning the latter. He also scored his tenth career goal in an Old Firm derby (nine of them for Rangers) when he captained the side in a 2–1 home defeat to Celtic on Hogmanay 2016. He also scored the only goal for Rangers in a 5–1 defeat to Celtic, the heaviest defeat at Ibrox since 1897. Miller scored his first goals of 2017 with a late brace in a 2–1 Scottish Cup win at home to Motherwell on 21 January and followed this a week later by netting the opening goal in a league match, also against Motherwell. On 28 April, Miller signed an extension to his contract until 2018 with manager Pedro Caixinha stating he was impressed by Millers professionalism and leadership.\n\nMiller scored the opening goal in Rangers' 2017–18 season against Progrès Niederkorn in the Europa League on 29 June 2017. Despite his goal, Rangers went on to lose 2–1 on aggregate, giving Progrès their first ever European win. Miller was dropped from the Rangers first team in September 2017. This came after Pedro Caixinha had criticised some of the team's Scottish players in a meeting after a 2–0 defeat by Celtic. Caixinha then suggested that a Rangers player had leaked team information to opponents, which led journalists to surmise that Miller had been the source. Caixinha was sacked in late October, and Miller was reinstated to the Rangers team by caretaker manager Graeme Murty; in his first game back, Miller scored two goals in a 3–1 win against Hearts.\n\nIn April 2018, Miller and teammate Lee Wallace were suspended by the club pending an internal investigation into an altercation with manager Murty, in the aftermath of the 2017–18 Scottish Cup semi-final which Rangers had lost 4–0 to Celtic. Miller was fined by Rangers and left the club at the end of his contract. Five months after the incident for which they were disciplined, Miller and Lee Wallace won an appeal at a SPFL tribunal against the action taken against them, with the expectation they would make a financial claim against Rangers for the fines imposed. Over his three spells at the club, he made 301 appearances in all competitions, scoring 116 goals.\n\nMiller was appointed player-manager of Scottish Premiership club Livingston in June 2018. He scored his first goal for the club on his third appearance, netting the only goal of a 1–0 victory over Dumbarton on 21 July in the group stage of the 2018–19 Scottish League Cup. He left the role on 19 August, with his departure being an 'amicable agreement' following discussions between Miller and the club hierarchy; they would have preferred him to give up playing and focus solely on the managerial role, which he was not prepared to do at that time. Livingston said that they had asked Miller to focus on his tasks as manager, but Miller had been unwilling to end his playing career. The following week, Miller's former Scotland teammate Gary Holt was appointed his successor at Livingston.\n\nMiller signed a two-year playing contract with Dundee on 29 August 2018. He failed to score in his first seven matches for the club but then scored five in three games, including a hat-trick at home to relegation rivals Hamilton Academical on 5 December. Dundee finished in bottom position in the Premiership table and were relegated to the Scottish Championship, with Miller leaving the club 'by mutual consent' during the summer off-season.\n\nOn 26 June 2019, Miller signed for Partick Thistle on a one-year contract. Miller, scored his first goal for Thistle in the League Cup v Queen's Park in a 2–1 win. Miller was released from his Thistle contract in January 2020, having scored 10 goals in all competitions for the club. He announced his retirement from playing football soon afterwards.\n\nMiller made his under-21 debut for Scotland in a 2–0 defeat to France at Rugby Park in March 2000. It was the first of a total of seven appearances at under-21 level, in which Miller registered two goals.\nMiller made his international debut, under the management of Craig Brown, on 25 April 2001. He was an 80th-minute substitute for Scott Booth during a 1–1 friendly match against Poland. He had to wait nearly two years for his second appearance when he was selected for a Euro 2004 qualifier by the then manager Berti Vogts in March 2003. Miller started the match at home to Iceland and scored within the first ten minutes to give Scotland the lead.\n\nFrom then until his international retirement in 2013, Miller was almost always first-choice, playing either on his own or as part of a two-man attack. He scored goals in important games against several teams, including Germany and Ukraine. In 2005, Miller scored four goals in three internationals, against Austria, Italy, and Norway.\n\nMiller won his 50th cap for Scotland in a 1–0 defeat against Czech Republic in October 2010. He captained the team for the first time, and scored, against Northern Ireland on 9 February 2011. Miller continued to represent Scotland after moving to Major League Soccer club Vancouver Whitecaps FC. He scored in the 3–2 defeat against England in August 2013, which meant that Miller had scored 18 goals in 69 appearances for Scotland. Miller retired from international football soon after the England match, with Scotland manager Gordon Strachan stating that Miller wanted to prolong his club career.\n\nUpon signing a contract extension with Rangers in November 2016, Miller took up a part-time coaching role with their Under-20 team. After leaving Rangers in 2018, Miller had a short stint as player/manager of Livingston. He then continued his playing career with Dundee and Partick Thistle. Miller retired as a player in February 2020 and took a coaching role with Australian club Newcastle Jets.\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers\n\nCeltic\n\nRangers\n\n\n\n"}

He won his first at Barcelona 1992, competing with the Unified Team, and later as a citizen of Greece at Atlanta 1996 and in Sydney 2000. He won three Senior World Championships (1995, 1998, 1999), was twice a silver medalist at the Senior World Championships (1993 and 1994), and set seven world records during his career.\n\nKakhiashvili was born in Tskhinvali, Georgia, to a Georgian father and a Greek mother, Maria Lamprianidi. He is renowned in weightlifting circles for his uncanny ability to lift exactly what was required to win. Dubbed as a \"computer\" by some competitors, he also had the ability to block out everything that was not relevant to the competition at hand.\nAt the 1992 Summer Olympics lifting for the Unified Team in the 90 kg category, he went against the instructions of his coach Vasily Alexeev, the all-time weightlifting great. His coach wanted his Russian teammate Sergey Syrtsov to win the contest and did not let Kakhiashvili try to lift heavier to beat the Russian.

He made one appearance for the Scotland national team in 1999.\n\nWinters started his career in Scotland and played for Dundee United between 1992 and 1997 and Aberdeen between 1998 and 2002. After a short spell at English club Luton Town, Winters played for the Norwegian club Brann between 2002 and 2008 where he won the Norwegian Cup and the Norwegian Premier League.\n\nWinters has later played for Clyde, Ayr United, Livingston, Grindavik, Alloa Athletic, Peterhead and Albion Rovers.\nNow playing for amateur team SEMSA in the SSMAFL\n\nWinters was born in East Kilbride on 4 November 1974, and started his career with amateur club Muirend. His younger brother David, who would also become a professional footballer, was born in 1983.\n\nWinters began his senior career with Dundee United in 1992 and played 118 league games for the club, scoring 27 times. A move to Aberdeen beckoned, which saw Billy Dodds and cash come to Tannadice in exchange for Winters. His time at Pittodrie was fruitful, with 41 goals from 132 league appearances. In the 2000 Scottish Cup final, Winters came on as a 2nd-minute substitute to replace injured goalkeeper Jim Leighton, who suffered a fractured cheekbone. Playing virtually the whole match in an unfamiliar position, Winters let in four goals as Rangers beat Aberdeen 4–0.\n\nAfter leaving in 2002 when his contract expired, Winters played one match for Luton Town, appearing in the first half of the first match of the season, before moving to Norway with Brann. After several seasons with hints about leaving Bergen due to family issues, Winters stated on 31 October that he no longer had the motivation needed to play for SK Brann, and that he wished to leave the club in January. He was seeking a club, preferably in Scotland, but he also stated that an English Championship club would be interesting. With no contract offer, Winters returned to SK Brann to make peace with manager Mons Ivar Mjelde and fulfil his contract until December 2007. Winters' Scottish teammate Charlie Miller did leave and subsequently joined Belgian side Lierse.\n\nWinters left Brann after the 2008 season, to join his family who had moved back to Scotland during the summer, due to his children starting school. Winters played 178 matches for Brann, scoring 70 goals. He signed a short-term deal with Clyde until the end of the season in April 2009. Winters was released by Clyde in June 2009 along with the rest of the out of contract players, due to the club's financial position.\n\nAfter an impressive performance as a trialist against Falkirk, Winters signed a professional contract with Livingston on 28 August 2009.\n\nWinters played for Icelandic club Grindavík in 2011. He scored on his debut against Thor. He then played for Alloa Athletic during the 2011–12 season and helped them win the Scottish Third Division championship. In the summer of 2012, Winters signed for Peterhead, before being released in February 2013 and going on a 3-game trial with Albion Rovers. He chose not to sign a contract at the expiration of the trial. He joined Dumbarton in March 2013.\n\nWinters signed for Rossvale in August 2014 and scored two goals on his debut. He then signed for Pollok in April 2015, where he joined his younger brother David. He joined Lowland League team East Kilbride in July 2015, but left the club the following month after \"a difference of opinion\" with manager Billy Ogilvie. Returning to Junior football, he made one appearance assisting Kilbirnie Ladeside before rejoining Pollok in September 2015.\n\nWinters came off the substitutes bench and scored with his first touch in the 2015–16 Scottish Junior Cup final for Pollok against Beith Juniors. He also scored in the penalty shootout which Pollok eventually lost. In August 2016, Winters rejoined East Kilbride for a second spell, this time in a player-coach role and was reunited with his former Rossvale manager, Martin Lauchlan. However, similarly to his first spell with the side, Winters time with the club was brief and he left in November 2016, due to a combination of work commitments and a lack of playing time.\n\nWinters joined Cumbernauld United in August 2017.\n\nWinters has one Scotland cap, when he appeared as a substitute in the 1–0 friendly win against Germany in Bremen, April 1999.\n\nIndividual\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Peter Suber has referred to the three events combined as the \"BBB definition\" of open access as the three overlap with and inform one another.\n\nThe declaration was drafted at an October 2003 conference held by the Max Planck Society and the European Cultural Heritage Online (ECHO) project. More than 120 cultural and political organizations from around the world attended.\n\nThe statement itself was published on October 22, 2003. Acknowledging the increasing importance of the internet and the previous discussions on the need for open access, it offered the following definition of an open access contribution:\n\nIt also encouraged researchers and institutions to publish their work in accordance with these principles, advocate for open access and help in the development and assessment of open access related tools and measures.\n\n, there are 646 signatories of the declaration. \n\nAt a 2005 follow-up conference, the declaration was refined to two key principles: signatories should require researchers to deposit a copy of their work in an open access repository and encourage the publication of work in open access journals when available. Today these two concepts are often called \"Green OA\" and \"Gold OA, \" respectively, and the two combined are referred to as an open-access mandate.\n\nIn 2013, on the 10th anniversary of the declaration, a mission statement was published with a goal of ensuring that 90% of research is published within an open access model.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2240500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2240500", "title": "Mordechai Nessyahu", "text": "Mordechai Nessyahu\n\nMordechai Nessyahu was an Israeli political theorist and philosopher of science, as well as the originator of a worldview he called \"cosmotheism\".\n\nWhile studying physics and philosophy at the Hebrew University, Nessyahu began to formulate the worldview he eventually called cosmotheism. He exchanged several letters on the subject with Albert Einstein. In 1953 he published a book in Hebrew entitled \"Ma'ada Ha'Cosmos vey Hevrat Ha'Mada\" (\"Cosmic Science and the Scientific Society\") which became the foundation of his eventual cosmotheistic formulation. Moshe Sharett, soon to be Israel's second prime minister, was so impressed by the book that he shared it with Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. As a result, Nessyahu was appointed Director of the Research Department of the Israeli Labor Party. Nessyahu remained in this position until his death.\n\nIn 1968 he met Tsvi Bisk, a new immigrant from the United States, who became his assistant at the Research Department. This meeting triggered a renewed interest in cosmotheism with Bisk as his collaborator and translator. Numerous English-language drafts of the idea were produced over the years and sent to hundreds of thinkers around the world to solicit their opinions. The year he died Nessyahu finally published his work in book form in Hebrew.\n\nThe cosmotheistic hypothesis stipulates that the Big Bang that created our cosmos was a local event in an infinite universe — a universe that contains an infinite number of cosmoi (what is now being speculated by theoretical physicists as the multiverse). It proposes that this cosmos is an evolutionary entity, in a constant state of ever growing complexity — that eventually has produced conscious life. It posits that due to the evolutionary nature of cosmic development, now being revealed by the \"new physics\" and \"new cosmology\", it is statistically certain that huge numbers of conscious life-forms (equivalent in self-awareness to human beings) have arisen throughout the cosmos; as if conscious life has been sown (as a cosmic genome) throughout the cosmos by the very process of cosmic evolution.\n\nNessyahu postulated that a number of these conscious life-forms will conclude that they must strive to become part of the God-ing of the cosmos. The expansion of conscious life throughout the cosmos will eventually be unfettered by its physical limitations and ultimately conscious life will fill the entire cosmos; it will become co-eval with a cosmos that has dissolved into pure radiation as an inevitable consequence of entropy. Thus the cosmos will become in its entirety a conscious universal being — i.e., the cosmos will have become God. Cosmotheism posits God as the consequence of the cosmos and not as its cause. Not in the beginning God created the cosmos but in the end the evolutionary cosmos will have created God.\n\nSince several racist groups co-opted the name \"cosmotheism\", Nessyahu's living colleague Tsvi Bisk decided to rename Nessyahu's hypothesis \"cosmodeism\", a name closer to the tradition of natural theology which cosmodeism best reflects. Bisk is presently writing a book entitled \"Cosmodeism: A Worldview for the Space Age.\"\n\n\"(all in Hebrew)\"\n\n"}

Uniquely nestled in nature, the museum is located along Mission Creek in the Mission Canyon area. The museum has ten indoor exhibit halls focusing on regional natural history including astronomy, birds, insects, geology, mammals, marine life, paleontology, plant life, and the Chumash Indians. Also, the museum is home to the only full-dome planetarium on the Central Coast, a research library, and the John & Peggy Maximus Art Gallery. \n\nThe early roots of the museum date back to the 1880s, when a group of professional and amateur scientists, including botanist Caroline Bingham, started the Santa Barbara Natural History Society and an accompanying museum at 1226 State Street. Though the effort waned at the end of the century, the arrival of ornithologist William Leon Dawson from Ohio re-ignited the effort. Dawson and a group of prominent Santa Barbarans founded the Museum of Comparative Oology, which was first located in two outbuildings on his property on Puesta del Sol Road in Mission Canyon. The initial holdings were assembled from his own extensive collection of bird eggs as well as collections of other community members. According to the museum's website, Dawson believed oology—the study of bird eggs—“would throw a flood of light upon the trend of life itself,” yielding “the secrets of life’s origins and its destiny.”\n\nThough it began from a collection of bird eggs, the holdings of the museum were soon expanded into other realms by its board of directors. The successor to William Dawson as director was Ralph Hoffmann, a Harvard-trained educator, botanist, and ornithologist. The next director was Paul Marshall Rhea, who had been president of the American Association of Museums, director of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, and director of the Carnegie Foundation in Washington, D.C.. Some of the notable benefactors of the museum included Dr. Caroline Hazard, who was president of Wellesley College at the time: she donated part of her estate in Mission Canyon for a new museum building. This building was built with funds donated by Mrs. Rowland G. Hazard in memory of her late husband and opened in 1923. The architect was Carleton Winslow.\n\nIn 1937, Arthur Sterry Coggeshall came to Santa Barbara, and took the position of director of the museum, a title he held for 21 years. He had also worked at various prestigious museums, such as the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh. Upon coming, he convinced Max Fleischmann, heir to the Fleischmann Yeast fortune, to build Fleischmann Auditorium as a condition of his employment. Coggeshall was later a key player in the foundation of the California Association of Museums and the Western Museum Association.\n\nFollowing Coggeshall, Dr. Vertress L. VanderHoof, a research geologist from the University of California, Berkeley, was hired as director. In 1965, Dr. Frederick H. Pough became director; he was a vulcanologist and mineralogist from the American Museum of Natural History. In between the tenure of these last two directors, interim directors were recruited from staff and an outsider who lasted only a short time. In 1972, the museum hired Dr. Dennis Power, an evolutionary biologist specializing in birds on islands. Power was a native Californian who at the time was an Associate Curator at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. He stayed until 1994 when he was recruited to be the executive director of the Oakland Museum of California, 22 years being the longest tenure of any of the museum's leaders. From the 1960s through the 1990s, the museum had a large role in the field of environmental action. Museum scientists helped establish the whale stranding network and participated in the California Condor Project. Museum staff also undertook contracted biological and anthropological surveys, among the most significant being the initial studies for the National Park Service that eventually led to the creation of Channel Islands National Park.\n\nAlbert Einstein, who was visiting the museum with his wife in 1931, remarked \"I can see that this museum has been built by the work of love.\"\n\nThe museum is renowned for fine dioramas of birds, mammals, and southern California habitats. These were illustrated in the 1930s and 1960s by famous artists of the California school of plein-aire painters. Among the most notable of these is the Bird Habitat Hall featuring mounted specimens by staff members Egmont Rett and Waldo Abbott and background paintings by Ray Strong. The museum is also known for its halls of marine life, geology, and Chumash Indian life, as well as an art gallery dedicated to antique natural history prints. It has collections of over 3 million specimens and an active research program with a focus on marine biology, terrestrial vertebrates, insects, anthropology, geological mapping, and natural history art. Greeting visitors near the front entrance is what has become an iconic display for the museum and Santa Barbara: a rearticulated skeleton of 72-foot Blue Whale\n\nTemporary exhibits cover the whole range of natural history topics such as dinosaurs, sharks, antique natural history art, \"Butterflies Alive\" and “Bringing the Condors Home” telling the story of the decline and beginning of recovery of the California condor. \n\nThe museum’s Gladwin Planetarium was renovated in early 2005 and equipped with technology to display distant planets, stars, and galaxies. The museum will launch a $30 million remodel in fall 2016, starting with the butterfly pavilion. During the renovation the museum will stay open and the square footage will remain unchanged.\n\nThe Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History Sea Center, formerly known as the \"Ty Warner Sea Center\", is an off-site facility owned and operated by the Museum of Natural History and is located on Santa Barbara’s historic Stearns Wharf. It originally opened in 1986 and was expanded and renovated in 2005. Among the exhibits of the Sea Center are a life-size model of a Gray Whale and calf, \"Tide Pool\" with waves rushing into it every 60 seconds, the \"Wet Deck\" featuring direct access to the water below, the \"Channel Theater\", the \"Workshop\", the \"Whale Karaoke\" station, and the plastinated dolphin.\n\nThe museum has one of the largest extant collections of historical Native American basketry by Chumash basket weaver artists.\n\n\n"}

It generally parallels Highway 2, beginning in the foothills of southern Alberta at Highway 3 near Lundbreck Falls. It proceeds north along the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains passing through the foothills and ranch country to the aspen parkland of northern Alberta, ending at Highway 18 near Mayerthorpe.\n\nCowboy Trail continues south and east of Highway 22 by following Highway 3 to Pincher Creek, Highway 6 to Waterton Lakes National Park, and Highway 5 to Cardston.\n\nAlberta Transportation is currently constructing a new interchange at the over-saturated intersection of Highways 22 and 1A in Cochrane. There are also long-term plans for twinning from Bragg Creek to the north end of Cochrane, and the implementation of passing lanes near the highway's south end.\n\nHighway 22 begins as a two-lane rural highway in the Municipal District of Pincher Creek No. 9 near Lundbreck Falls at Highway 3, the Crowsnest Highway. It proceeds north across increasingly flatter terrain of the foothills, parallel to the Oldman River, and then crosses it before entering the Municipal District of Ranchland No. 66. The highway winds to the east of the Black Heritage Rangeland Natural Area, intersecting Highway 520 which branches east to meet Highway 2 at Claresholm. Highway 22 continues north through scenic terrain to the Chain Lakes Reservoir, from which Highway 533 splits east to meet Highway 2 at Nanton. 22 continues north through Longview, Black Diamond, Turner Valley, and Millarville. The highway then jogs west at Highway 22X. Approximately later, the road turns north again and passes through Bragg Creek where Highway 22X ends. Highway 22 continues north past the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) west of Calgary, north through the Town of Cochrane, the Hamlet of Cochrane Lake, and the Village of Cremona to Highway 27.\n\nThe highway continues in a generally northward direction (with a number of westward jogs), passing through Sundre, Caroline, Rocky Mountain House and Drayton Valley until it intersects Highway 16 (Yellowhead Highway) at Entwistle approximately west of Edmonton).\nAfter a jog to the west, it continues north to cross Highway 43 in Mayerthorpe, ending north of the town at Highway 18.\n\nThe original alignment of Highway 22 started at Highway 2 (Macleod Trail) south of Calgary and travelled west to Priddis, where it turned south to Turner Valley and terminated at Highway 7 in Black Diamond. In the 1970s, the province of Alberta began upgrading a series of roads to form a north-south, all-weather highway west of Highway 2. Beginning in , the road connecting the Trans-Canada Highway and Cochrane was designated as part of Highway 22. In , the numbered secondary highway system appeared, with the road between Cochrane and Highway 27 being designated as Highway 922 (the paved section between Cremona and Bottrel became Highway 22) while the road between Priddis and Bragg Creek was briefly designated as Highway 553, becoming Highway 922 in 1975. Throughout the remainder of the 1970s, Highway 922 was extended from Highway 3 in the south to Highway 57 near Drayton Valley in the north. Coinciding with Highway 922 being paved in , Highway 22 was extended from Cochrane to Cremona, while the following year it replaced Highway 922 between the Trans-Canada Highway and Priddis; as part of the project, the section between Priddis and Macleod Trail was renumbered as Highway 22X.

Throughout the 1980s, Highway 22 was paved, with all but a small section near Chain Lakes Provincial Park being completed by 1990 (the latter was completed in the mid-1990s).\n\nIn 2014, a new $52 million bridge across the North Saskatchewan River near Drayton Valley was completed, replacing the original bridge which was constructed in 1957.\n\nAlberta Transportation retained Tetra Tech EBA to complete a study in the feasibility of new passing lanes over a distance of Highway 22 between Highways 3 and 543. The study was published in August 2011 and determined that passing lanes are justified at several locations, but Alberta Transportation currently has no plans to proceed with the project. In April 2017, Alberta Transportation announced plans for a new interchange at Highway 1A in Cochrane, with the selection of an engineering consultant taking place during the summer and the anticipated start of construction beginning as early as Fall 2019. As part of a separate project, Alberta Transportation completed a long-term study to twin Highway 22 between Cochrane and Highway 8, including replacing the cloverleaf interchange at Highway 1; no timeline has been set for construction.\nFrom south to north:\n\n"}

It is currently a part of the Red Corridor.\n\nThe district is named after its headquarters, the town of Hazaribagh. The name, Hazaribagh consists of two Persian words, \"hazar\" meaning \"one thousand\", and \"bagh\" meaning \"garden\" - so, the literal meaning of Hazaribagh is 'a city of one thousand gardens'. According to Sir John Houlton, a veteran British administrator, the town takes its name from the small villages of Okni and Hazari – shown in old maps as Ocunhazry. The last syllable in its name probably originated in a mango-grove, which formed a camping ground for troops and travellers marching along the ‘new military road’ from Kolkata to Varanasi, constructed in 1782 and the following years.\n\nThere are ancient Cave Paintings in Isko, Hazaribagh district which are from Meso-chalcolithic period (9,000-5,000 BC).

Instead, it is made almost entirely of sugar, liquorice, and ammonium chloride. Because of this, Lakrisal drops are powdery, and have been pressed to stay in one piece like tablets. Persons suffering from hypertension should avoid excessive intake of Lakrisal.\n\nLakrisal is also unlike most salty liquorice candies by not being black. Instead, it is a very light brownish gray colour. Lakrisal drops are disk-shaped, about 18 mm in diameter and about 4 mm thick. They are sold in tubes of about 20 drops each.\n\nIn the 1980s, a new lemon-flavoured variety of Lakrisal was introduced. It proved quite unpopular and was soon discontinued. Another flavour was the \"hot\" Lakrisal that included chili pepper powder and pepper oil.\n\nLakrisal is a direct continuation of a similar product Bronzol, launched as a throat tablet, which was advertised under the slogan \"Hälsan för halsen - Bronzol!\" (\"Health for the throat - Bronzol!\", sung to the melody of Shave and a Haircut).

{"id": "2240588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2240588", "title": "A Ballads", "text": "A Ballads\n\nA Ballads (stylized as BALLADS) is the second greatest hits compilation by Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki. It was released physically on March 12, 2003 through Avex Trax, and digitally distributed worldwide on September 14, 2006 by Avex Entertainment Inc. It is her first compilation release in two years since \"A Best\"; it premiered three months after her sixth studio album \"Rainbow\". The compilation compiles ballad-inspired singles released by Hamasaki between 1998 and 2003, whilst the material is divided into new-arrangement remixes and the original versions. With all the tracks written by Hamasaki, it includes two new songs— \"Rainbow\", which served as the album's promotional single, and a cover version of Japanese singer Yumi Matsutoya's 1975 track \"Sotsugyō Shashin\".\n\nReleased in six formats featuring a photograph by JFKK, \"A Ballads\" received favorable reviews from music critics. Many praised the collection for including some of Hamasaki's best vocal work, and commended the songwriting. Minor criticism was aimed on the newer renditions of the original songs. Commercially, the album was a success in Japan, reaching number one on the Oricon Albums Chart, making it Hamasaki's second compilation and eighth album to reach the top spot. It was certified Million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of one million units. The album experienced limited promotion during its release, with some of the tracks appearing during Japanese commercial endorsements.\n\nIn December 2002, Hamasaki released her sixth studio album \"Rainbow\". Early issues of the album included a code number and URL address that allowed customers to visit an exclusive website that promoted the album and listen to a 40-second demo of her unfinished song \"Rainbow\". During its promotion, Avex Trax and Hamasaki received over 100,000 messages from fans, telling them their opinions about the unfinished demo. Due to the mixed response of her fanbase, Hamasaki decided to develop the song further and release it as part of an upcoming compilation album, which was later named \"A Ballads\". During the process, Hamasaki confessed that \"[she] had never before written lyrics that were based on messages received directly from [her] fans. It was with \"Rainbow\" that [she] decided to give this approach a try\".\n\n\"A Ballads\" is Hamasaki's first compilation to compile songs that were inspired by ballad music, with it portraying her second greatest hits album after \"A Best\" (2001). Each track from the album was released either as a single or as a promotional recording, recorded between the years 1998 and 2003. Six of the tracks on the album were composed and co-produced by Hamasaki, who used the alias Crea. The album consists of fifteen tracks, including two new recordings—\"Rainbow\" and a cover version of Japanese singer Yumi Matsutoya's 1975 track \"Sotsugyō Shashin\". Seven of the album's tracks—\"Appears\", \"You\", \"To Be\", \"M\", \"Seasons\", \"A Song for ××\" and \"Who...\"— feature new arrangements and compositions, whilst the songs \"Key\", \"Hanabi\", \"Dearest\" and \"Voyage\" are included with their original versions.\n\nTo explain Hamasaki's the background and development, Hamasaki hosted a commentary on her website. The first song, \"Rainbow\", was originally composed by CMJK, but Hamasaki felt the finishing product was \"missing something\", and re-worked the demo version with Japanese musician Dai Nagao. According to Hamasaki, she wanted to reflect the emotion and words used in each 100,000 messages she received from her fans to create the song, but because there were numerous emails, she decided to write it as a summary and her feelings as an \"aftermath\" from reading the messages. The song was described by a staff member at \"CD Journal\" as an \"organic midtempo pop ballad\" song. \"Appears\" was remixed by Japanese group HΛL. According to Hamasaki, she had asked the group to re-compose their original version of the track in order to reflect \"current [musical] themes of 2003.\"\n\nThe album included the original version of \"Key (Eternal Tie)\" as Hamasaki felt that the original was \"more important and unknown\" than the proposed-reworked version she had planned. \"You (Northern Breeze)\" was one of the last reworked tracks, and was described by Hamasaki as being influenced by Western music. \"To Be (2003 ReBirth Mix)\" was not re-worked or re-arranged by any of the album's collaborators, with it being purely remastered and mixed again by music engineer Koji Morimoto. \"Hanabi\" was one of the album's only tracks to appear in its original version, and has been described by a \"CD Journal\" staff member to have been inspired by Europop, trip hop, and dub music. \"Dolls\", a J-pop influenced pop ballad, remained the sophomore original track to make part of the record.\n\nLike \"To Be\", the next track \"Seasons\" was remastered and mixed by Morimoto. The final original track, \"Voyage\", was described by \"CD Journal\" as a midtempo ballad influenced by gospel music, layered with several string arrangements and other instrumentation. \"A Song for ××\" was re-worked as a live demo, recorded at the Avex Trax studios in Japan. For the promotional track \"Who...\", Hamasaki asked CMJK to create a more \"warmer\" version than the original. The closing track for \"A Ballads\" was \"Sotsugyō Shashin\". According to Hamasaki, she had imagined recording a cover for a studio album, but was unsuccessful at doing so. To compose the track, she and the song's co-composer Tasuku composed it by using a Fender Rhodes Suitcase Mk I electric piano in order to reflect the song's original 1960s–1970s pop influence.\n\n\"A Ballads\" was released physically on March 12, 2003 through Avex Trax in five formats, and digitally distributed worldwide on September 14, 2006 by Avex Entertainment Inc. The first five formats were compact discs; each one of the four early editions included a slipcase sleeve that had two clones of Hamasaki asleep next to each other, with the inner booklet portraying four different photographs of the clones. The four alternative covers were different variations of the two Hamasaki figures in a pink-coloured room. The fifth format came without a slipcase, and had the slipcase image as the inner booklet cover. The digital release featured the slipcase cover and the entire photo shoot was photographed by JFKK.\n\nUpon its release, \"A Ballads\" received favorable reviews from most music critics. Tetsuo Hiraga from \"Hot Express\" believed that the album's material was able to connect with both younger and older audiences. He also pointed out the \"Royal-esque\" tracks \"Seasons\" and \"Dearests\" as some of her best recordings. An editorial review on HMV singled out \"A Ballads\" as one of the best ballad albums in recent history; the review labelled it a \"classic\", and commended Hamasaki's vocal abilities, her songwriting and her vulnerability. In a similar review, a staff member of \"CD Journal\" enjoyed the album and complimented its new additions to the album.\n\nCommercially, the album was successful in Japan, with it debuting at number one on the Oricon Albums Chart and replacing \"200 Km/h in the Wrong Lane\" (2002) by Russian female duo t.A.T.u. at the top spot. Hamasaki's entry sold 561,127 units in comparison to t.A.T.u.'s 167,627 unit sales. By the end of 2003, \"A Ballads\" was ranked at number eight as the best selling album in Japan of that year. It sold 917,555 units, and was also her second album to enter the top ten, just behind \"Rainbow\" which sold 1,856,919 units. As of July 2016, it has sold over 924,242 units, her first greatest hits album to not sell over the one million mark. Nevertheless, it was certified Million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of one million units. It is Hamasaki's ninth best selling album based on Oricon's sale database.\n\nThe album experienced limited promotion during its release, with some of the tracks appearing during Japanese commercial endorsements. The compilation's only release was promotional song \"Rainbow\", which was used as the theme song for Hamasaki's Japanese talk show \"Ayuready?\", and to promote products by Lumix. An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Wataru Takeishi, featuring two clones of Hamasaki chasing each other, and eventually meeting at a dinner in Japan. Near the end of the video, it is revealed that the second clone is in fact her imagination or conscious.\n\nOricon Sales Chart (Japan)\n\n"}

He first appeared on 6 November 1995, and Littler took over the role in September 1997. In 2008, Max was the second longest running character in \"Hollyoaks\", after Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard). In May 2008, it was announced that Littler had decided to leave the show and would depart in July 2008.\n\nThe character of Max first appeared in 1995 as one of the original \"Hollyoaks\" characters. At this time, he was played by actor Ben Sheriff. \"Hollyoaks\" producer Phil Redmond decided to recast the character in 1997 when he found Matt Littler. Littler spoke of playing an already established character stating: \"I didn't really watch it much, so it didn't really affect me\" and also revealed he had met with Sheriff and his career was fine post filming. Littler followed the role for almost eleven years until his decision to leave the show in 2008.\n\nMax found himself surrounded by death, with older sister Dawn dying of leukaemia in 1997. His stepbrother Lewis committed suicide in 2001. His death made Max look at life in a different way, deciding to spend less time with OB and open a new business, a burger van. Max also began dating Jodie Nash, however it was soon over. In 2004, Max saw more misery when his father Gordon and stepmother Helen were killed in a car crash. Max took it upon himself to raise younger half brother Tom. In 2006, another death hit the family, this time Max's step niece Grace Hutchinson, who died to suspected Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. With the four deaths, Max decided to live his life to the full rather than not get to live in at all. Max then met and fell in love with Clare Devine.\n\nMax found himself engaged to Clare Devine, who he had previously hired as an event organiser for The Loft. OB saw through gold-digging Clare and tried to tell Max. Max and OB ended up falling out over Clare. After Max suffered a heart attack, Clare took it upon herself to make sure he never recovered. She started tampering with his pills. During Christmas in a secluded cottage, Max found out that Clare had tampered with his pills and realised OB was right about her. Clare had put Tom's jacket in an icy lake outside, which made Max jump in. Clare the revealed Tom was in no danger as he was not in the lake. Luckily, OB turned up and rescued Max.\n\nClare called the social services and told them Max was hurting Tom, and also told Tom that he was the cause of his parents and Grace's deaths and if he spoke to Max, Max would die. Clare, who had built up many enemies in Hollyoaks, was pushed over a balcony at The Loft and was left for dead. Max and OB were two of the suspects, however Max's name was soon cleared. Max made a visit to a recovering Clare at her home and threatened her, telling her if she did not tell the social services she made Max's abuse of Tom up, he would kill her. Clare then agreed. Clare was forced out of Hollyoaks, however kidnapped Katy Fox. Max, Warren Fox and Justin Burton followed Clare to save her. A high speed car chase led to Clare and Katy plummeting over a quarry into water below. Warren and Justin jumped in to save Katy. Max then leapt in to save Clare, even though she had repeatedly tried to kill him. Under the water, Max tried to save Clare who was pulled away by the current and apparently drowned. Back in Hollyoaks, Max had a heart to heart with Steph Dean, who told Max it was not his fault Clare had died.\n\nMax and Steph grew closer and eventually found themselves in love. The pair found themselves breaking up on several occasions. Steph then embarked on a relationship with Niall Rafferty, however, realising she loved Max, ended it and got back with Max. Max and Steph then announced their engagement. Matt Littler made the decision to leave the show after eleven years. Speaking of his decision to leave, Littler stated, \"I feel that I have grown up on \"Hollyoaks\" over the past eleven years and I'm not only leaving behind friends but also family.

I'd just like to thank everyone who has made my life at \"Hollyoaks\" a very happy one.\" It was also announced that Max's departure would involve his wedding to Steph. \"Hollyoaks\" producer Bryan Kirkwood commented on what the future holds for Littler, stating, \"Matt, together with Darren Jon Jefferies have created a partnership in Max and O.B. that has been at the heart of Hollyoaks success for the last eleven years.

Max saw this and pushed Tom out of the way, however Niall ended up running him over. Max died in OB's arms with Steph and Tom also present. Max's final appearance was the month following his death. While OB was leaving for a new life in America, he turned around and saw Max standing outside Drive 'n' Buy.\n\nMax first appears as part of the Cunningham family in 1995, as the youngest child and only son. His parents were already divorced, as his mother was re-married. However Max's life changed, when he received bad news, as he was devastated when Dawn Cunningham had an affair with Jack Osborne leading to their daughter Bethany, being put up for adoption. Dawn suffered with leukaemia, which lead to her death. One year after Dawn's death, Max's sister, Jude Cunningham got herself in trouble with the police, after stealing a cars along with their father's cousin Benny to pay off her debt. Also his other sister, Cindy Cunningham was pregnant, due to a one night stand with Lee Stanley, and gave birth to their daughter Holly, on the day Dawn died. But when her father got killed in car accident, Cindy begins a relationship with Sean, but turns to abused along with Holly, causing them and Jude to leave the country. Max and OB make up money-making schemes, and create their own single. The CD became a failure. Max starts working at Hollyoaks College.

Max reveals his sensitive side in his affection for Anna Green, helping her during the difficult stages of her pregnancy. Max and Anna both admit their feelings to each other and they sleep together in Max's van. Anna tells boyfriend Alex Bell about the affair and she moves in with Max and her son Charlie. Max finds it difficult staying with Anna as he never really has much time for social life. Another tragedy hits Max whilst he, OB, Ben Davies, Kristian Hargreaves, Jamie Nash and Theo Sankofa go potholing. The trip results in a rock fall and leaves Theo and Jamie dead. After returning home, Max ends his relationship with Anna.\n\nOB tells Max that his stepmother Helen Cunningham is having an affair with Tony Hutchinson. Max is angered by Helen and Tony's actions towards his father so he warns them if they continue, he will tell Gordon. Helen and Tony continue their affair so Max tells a devastated Gordon. Helen then leaves Gordon for Tony and prepares to leave. During a journey together, Gordon and Helen are involved in a car accident when Gordon suffers a heart attack at the wheel of the car. Luckily, Tom isn't injured. With Gordon already dead, Helen suddenly collapses at home and soon passes away in hospital, leaving Max as Tom's legal guardian. Max's stepsister Mandy supports Max, as does OB. After Tom burns down the house after playing with firecrackers, the social services arrive. Max tells Mandy he thinks Tom should be put into care, which Tom overhears. Tom then runs away from home and is found at his parents grave. Max, OB and Tom then move into the flat next to Mandy and new fiancé Tony. Yet another tragedy hits the family when Mandy and Tony's daughter Grace dies of SIDS.\n\nTony makes OB and Max managers of The Loft after the pair work hard to show him they are responsible. Tony eventually gives The Loft to them as a Christmas present. Max and OB's first major decision for the club is to hire an events organiser, Clare Devine. Both Max and OB immediately fall for Clare. After an ultimatum, Clare chooses Max. Max and Clare's relationship begins well and Max asks her to move in with him, OB and Tom. OB's girlfriend Mel Burton catches Clare having an affair with Sean Kennedy and tries to tell Max. Due to her alcoholism, no one believes Mel except OB, causing a drift between Max and OB. Max and Clare get engaged. OB tries to make Max see Clare's true self, however is unsuccessful. At their wedding, OB bursts in begging Max to rethink his engagement. Max hits him and vows never to speak to him again. After the wedding, Max tells her he wants to start a family. Clare fakes being pregnant and also a miscarriage and tells Max she cannot have children. After finding Clare and Warren Fox taking cocaine, Max decides to join them and takes some as well. This causes a heart attack which leads to Max having to go on medication. Clare begins to tamper with this medication in order to bring on a second heart attack. During a Christmas break at an isolated cottage, Max finds the tampered medication and realises the truth. On seeing Tom supposedly in an icy lake, Max jumps in after him, however Clare has tricked him and refuses to help. OB arrives, punches Clare, saves Max and struggles to revive him. Luckily, he does. Max apologises to OB over not believing him. After Clare threatens him, Max signs The Loft over to Clare. With their friendship back on track, Max and OB open a new business, a juice bar called MOBS.\n\nClare is pushed over the balcony of The Loft and Max becomes one of five named suspects for her attempted murder. Tony and Dom give Max their alibi for the night. Clare returns from hospital and tells social services Max is hurting Tom. Max breaks into Clare's flat and threatens to kill her if she does not tell them she made everything up, which she does. Clare signs The Loft over to Warren Fox and is forced out of Hollyoaks. She also discovers Justin Burton pushed her over The Loft balcony. In revenge, Clare kidnaps Katy Fox. Warren, Justin and Max set off to find her. After a dangerous car chase, Clare's car goes over a quarry into water below. Warren and Justin jump in after Katy while Max attempts to save Clare. Clare is dragged underwater by a current and apparently drowns, however is revealed to have survived. Max tells Steph Dean of his guilt over letting Clare die and have a heart to heart, in which they appear to grow close.\nSteph begins helping Max look after Tom. The pair begin to fall for each other. After several failed attempts, Max finally tells Steph his true feelings and they begin a relationship. With Max spending more time with Steph, OB begins to feel left out. OB befriends Simon Crosby, who apparently turns out to be a paedophile. Max and Jake Dean attack Simon's home with other residents. Innocent Simon tries to commit suicide, however survives. After Max discovers Simon was innocent, he apologises to OB, who is disgusted, although they later made up. OB decides to leave for London with girlfriend Summer Shaw. Max and Tom bare OB a sad farewell as he leaves. Max decides to propose to Steph, which she accepts. Max and Steph's engagement is short-lived when they split up and she seeks comfort in Niall Rafferty. Niall falls in love with Steph, who then gets back together with Max. With the wedding back on, Max's mother Angela, sister Cindy, niece Holly, stepsister Mandy and also OB return for his wedding, except for his older sister Jude, who cannot attend to the wedding due to being wanted by the police in ten years ago, and Steph father Johnno. After a perfect wedding, distraught Niall speeds off in his car. Max sees him driving unknowingly towards Tom and rushes, pushing him out of the way in time. Tragically, Max is hit. Max is held by OB and Tom as he bleeds. Steph rushes to his side as he passes away.\n\nIn 2016, when Jude returns to the village, she went to Max's graveyard and apologize to him for not being there for him at the time when he is controlled his mind by his ex-wife Claire & her actions she has caused for the family.\n\nFor his portrayal of Max, Matt Littler won the 'Outstanding Serial Drama Performance' at the 2008 National Television Awards. Subsequent to his National Television Awards nomination, the character has also won the award for 'Best On-screen Partnership' with Darren Jeffries (OB) at The 2008 British Soap Awards.

{"id": "2240648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2240648", "title": "Field ration", "text": "Field ration\n\nA field ration (also known as combat ration, ration pack, or food packet) is a canned or pre-packaged meal, easily prepared and consumed by military troops. They are distinguished from regular military garrison rations by virtue of being designed for minimal preparation in the field, using canned, vacuum-sealed, pre-cooked or freeze-dried foods, powdered beverage mixes and concentrated food bars, as well as for long shelf life. Most field rations typically contains meat as one of its main course.\n\nSuch meals also prove invaluable for disaster relief operations, where large stocks of these can be ferried and distributed easily, and provide basic nutritional support to victims before kitchens can be set up to produce fresh food. Rations intended for emergency or disaster relief are often referred to as survival rations.\n\nMost armed forces in the world today now field some form of pre-packaged combat ration, often suitably tailored to meet national, regional or ethnic tastes.\n\nTraditionally hexamine has been the preferred solid fuel for cooking rations. An alternative is gelatinised ethanol.\n\nThe Ración de Combate (Individual) was introduced in 2003, consisting of a gray plastic-foil laminate pouch containing a mix of canned and dehydrated foods, plus minimal supplements, for 1 soldier for 1 day. All products in the RC are domestically produced, commercially available items. Each ration contains: canned meat, small can of meat spread, crackers, instant soup, cereal bar with fruit, a chocolate bar with nuts or caramels, instant coffee, orange juice powder, sugar, salt, a heating kit with disposable stove and alcohol-based fuel tablets, disposable butane lighter, resealable plastic bag, cooked rice and a pack of paper tissues.\n\nMenu #1 contains: corned beef, meat pate, crisp water crackers, and instant soup with fideo pasta.\n\nMenu #2 contains: roasted beef in gravy, meat pate, whole wheat crackers, and quick-cooking polenta in cheese sauce.\n\nThe Ração Operacional de Combate – R2 is the current field & combat ration for the Brazilian Army.

It contains the food and supplemental items needed by 1 soldier for 24 hours. It is to be used in situations where no other type of ration is available. All foods are packed inside 4-ply plastic & aluminum polylaminate retort pouches and are ready to eat without further preparation.\n\nThe ration is packed inside a heavy-duty (.25 mm thick) matte green or olive drab polyethylene bag measuring 300 mm wide by 400 mm long. It is printed with the logo of the Brazilian Army, \"Ração de Combate R2 (24 Horas)\" and Menu information.

This is a 12-hour ration to be used in situations where cooked foods cannot be provided for all meals.\n\nThe ration is similar to the R2 and uses the same components, but contains less food. The bag is printed with the emblem of the Brazilian Army, \"Ração de Emergência R3 (12 Horas)\" and Menu information. Inside are 3 thin plastic bags: 2 meal bags and 1 accessory packet.\n\nInformation from Mreinfo.com.\n\nCanada provides each soldier with a complete pre-cooked meal known as the IMP (Individual Meal Pack), packaged inside a heavy-duty folding paper bag. There are 5 breakfast menus, 6 lunch menus, and 6 supper menus. Canadian rations provide generous portions and contain a large number of commercially available items. Like the US ration, the main meal is precooked and ready-to-eat, packed in heavy-duty plastic-foil retort pouches boxed with cardboard. Typically, the ration contains a meal item (beans and wiener sausages, scalloped potatoes with ham, smoked salmon fillet, macaroni and cheese, cheese omelette with mushrooms, shepherd's pie, etc.), wet-packed (sliced or mashed) fruit in a boxed retort pouch, and depending on the meal a combination of instant soup or cereal, fruit drink crystals, jam or cheese spread, peanut butter, honey, crackers, bread (bun) compressed into a retort pouch, coffee and tea, sugar, commercially available chocolate bars and hard candy, a long plastic spoon, paper towels and wet wipes.

It is packaged in an olive green and black plastic box with the contents printed on the front; the box contains three individual meal packs containing meals providing which are meant to sustain a soldier for one day. Each individual meal package contains two main retort pouches which are meant to be eaten with each other. The first retort pouch usually contains a meat product (such as beef, pork, sausage, fish, ham, seafood, chicken, tuna, bacon or other meats which are usually mixed with a flavoring sauce and vegetables) the second retort pouch contains a staple food (rice, hominy, noodles, beans, pasta, eggs or more vegetables). Each meal package also contains salt, spices, condensed milk, cream, butter, chorizo spread, dried fruit or preserves, bread, crackers, sugar, custard, cookies, canned fish, cocoa mix, nuts, chocolate or other candies, vitamins, a large pouch of drinking water, a pouch of Jumex fruit juice or Coca-Cola, biodegradable napkins and utensils and water purification tablets. Some meal packages do not contain the two main retort pouches and instead contain a single larger pouch with a finished meal such as tamales or steak and eggs but, these are usually only available when close to a base or when the military is operating in an urban area. When these were handed out by the Mexican military during their assistance in the Hurricane Katrina relief operation many Americans who received them gave very high praise about their taste and variety.\n\nThe United States' Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE) is packaged similarly to the Canadian ration. Each sealed plastic bag contains one entire precooked meal, with a number of supplements and accessories. The original 12 menus have been expanded to 24 and now contain a variety of ethnic and special request items as well. Kosher/Halal and Vegetarian menus are also provided.

It consist of Drytech freeze-dried main meals and several additional items such as dried fruits and nuts, energy bars, hard biscuits, meat pate etc.\n\nWhen (during peacetime) conscript soldiers are not provided with meals cooked either in garrisons or attached field kitchens, they are provided with rations (colloquially known as sissi rations) packed in a clear plastic bag. Several different menus exist, however all include foil packed crispbread, coffee and tea, sugar, chocolate, small tins of beef or pork, chewing gum, dry porridge, energy drink powder etc. Soups and porridges that are meant to be mixed with water and cooked are usually prepared in Trangia-type portable stoves that are shared by the pair in a fire and maneuver team, or in individual mess kits.\n\nThe French 24-hour combat ration, the RCIR (ration de combat individuelle réchauffable) comes in 14 menus packed in a small cardboard box.

Practice is to provide one hot cooked meal for the other meal whenever possible. A heater or oven is not included since an Esbit cooker is part of each soldier's personal equipment. Enough food items are contained within the EPA to sustain the soldier for 24 hours. Currently there are three menus; each includes two meals out of a selection of 19 meals, with several heavy-duty foil trays containing items such as lentils with sausages, Yugoslav Sausage, Goulash, beef patties in tomato sauce, Italian pasta, or Tofu stir-fry.

R&D are working close with soldiers in Scandinavia and various missions around the world.\n\nNorway utilize a 24-hour ration pack (Norwegian \"feltrasjon\") designed by Drytech, consisting of 2 freeze-dried main meals, a packet of compressed breakfast cereal, packets of instant soup, and supplements. These are packed in 3 green polylaminate bags labelled \"Breakfast\", \"Lunch\", or \"Dinner\", overwrapped in clear plastic and issued as one day's ration. Depending on the soldiers activity, the rations are delivered in two different sizes of either 3800 kcal or 5000 kcal. Included are a substantial assortment of beverages (cocoa mix, instant coffee, energy drink powder, and herbal teas), plus thin sliced rye bread and chocolate, chewing gum, a vitamin tablet, and litter bags. There are 7 completely different menus, and ongoing development to meet different nations requirements. The main meals are for example Chili con carne, different pasta dishes, Beef Stew, Beef and Potato Casserole, Lamb Muligatawny, Cod and Potato Casserole, Pasta Bolognese, Wolf-fish with Prawns and Dill, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Rice in Basil Sauce etc. Small tins of fish are often provided separately.\n\nThe current Polish combat ration (Zestaw Żywnościowy Indywidualnej Racji Suchej) is packed in a green plastic-foil bag containing: 2 small cans of meat or meat spread or cheese, 2 packages of hard crackers, a tube of sweetened condensed milk, 2 packets of instant coffee, a packet of instant tea, 3 sugar packets, an individually wrapped Vitamin C fortified boiled sweets, a stick of chewing gum, safety matches, a menu and instruction sheet, a plastic bag, and 2 paper towels.\n\nField ration (24h) \"RB1\" / \"RB2\" / \"RB3\"\n\nMeal A (breakfast):\n- goulash 400 g / beans with sausage and meat in tomato sauce 400 g / pork shoulder with rice and vegetables 400 g\n- pate 100 g\n- jam 25 g\n- crispbread 50 g\n- instant tea 30 g\n- fruit bar\n- flameless heater\n- sachet water 45 ml\n\nMeal B (lunch):\n- chicken with rice and vegetables 400 g / spaghetti with meat 400 g / bogracz (Hungarian dish densely with beef ) 400 g\n- crackers 45 g\n- instant tea 30 g\n- condensed milk tube 100 g\n- dark chocolate 50 g\n- flameless heater\n- sachet water 45 ml\n\nMeal C (dinner):\n- canned meat 100 g\n- crackers 45 g\n- honey 25 g\n- instant tea 30 g\n- fruit bar\n\nAccessories:\n- sugar 10 g x3\n- coffee candy x3\n- vitamin C candy x3\n- chewing gum x3\n- salt, pepper x3\n- dried fruits 50 g\n- instant tea\n- instant borsch\n- plastic bag\n- matches\n- toilet paper\n- wet wipe tissue x3\n- cutlery\n\nEnergy value 3496,15kcal / 3693,82 kcal / 3459,6 kcal\nWeight 1,85 kg\n\nSince the turn of the Millennium Russia issues the Individual Food Rations (Individual'nyi Ratsion Pitaniya (\"IRP\") (Индивидуальный рацион питания/ИРП), a new self-contained ration, containing the whole daily food intake for an individual soldier in the field. However, in its most frequent form it is not dietary complete, and is intended only as a stop-gap measure to be issued until the normal supply lines (with their field kitchens) are established and the hot food delivery started, to be issued for no more than six days straight. Russian Ministry of defence does not strictly prescribe the contents of the ration, only some basic packaging and inventory requirements, so every producer issues their own version. Most commonly it is packaged into a sturdy plastic blister box (nicknamed \"The Frog\" in the field for its olive-green color), or plastic-sealed cardboard box that contains five to six entrees in laminated foil cans or retort pouches, four to six pack of crackers or preserved bread, two to three dessert items in form of a spread or fruit bar, four beverage concentrate pouches, some seasonings (salt, pepper, sugar, ketchup), and various sundry items like sanitizing wipes/paper towels, spoons, can opener, four hexamine fuel tablets, folding heater, matches and water purifier tablets. The types of entrees vary with the producer and the issued menu (of which there are usually 7 to 12), but the common set is based on a traditional Russian outdoorsmen fare, is largely formed out of the commercially available canned food, and usually includes 1 portion of stewed beef or pork, two meat-with-vegetables dishes, like various porridges, stews or canned fish, and one or two spreads, such as liver pate, sausage stuffing or processed cheese. Desserts may include fruit jams, chocolate and/or walnut spreads, chocolate bars, sweetened condensed milk, etc., but baked goods are usually avoided out of concerns about their shelf life. Other variants may add canned speck and/or dried fish or exchange the hexamine tablets for the flameless heater.\n\nThe Spanish Army issues an individual meal pack, available in 5 different menus, comprising a small cardboard box overwrapped with drab green polyethylene. Inside are 3 canned meals, plus accessories. Typical contents (Menu B) include: stewed steak, pickled mackerel, liver pâté with red peppers, an envelope of instant soup, a can of fruit, 2 salt tablets, 2 water purification tablets, a large multivitamin tablet, 10 sheets of general purpose paper, a book of matches, a folding can opener, a small folding ration heater and 2 fuel tablets, and an instruction sheet in three languages (Spanish, English and French). Crackers or bread are issued separately.\n\nThe 12 hour operational ration pack (ORP) is designed for patrolling for durations of 4–12 hours and for is suitable for remote guard posts, drivers and as a supplement to normal rations for where daily calorie expenditure is likely to exceed 6000 kcal (25,120 kJ)(for instance, troops undergoing arduous duties.)\n\nThe 12 hour ORP contains a main meal packed in a retort pouch, a number of snack items, drink powders and a flameless ration heater (FRH). However it does not contain any hot beverage items.\n\nThere are 10 menu choices including one vegetarian.\nThe 12 hour ORP provides a minimum of 2000 kcals (8,374 kJ).\n\nThe UK provides the Operational Ration Pack, General Purpose. Packed inside a small cardboard box, each ration has enough retort-pouched and canned foods to feed one soldier for 24 hours. Seven menus (plus vegetarian and religious variants) provide two precooked meals (Breakfast and Main Meal) plus a midday snack. Example (Menu A) Breakfast: Hamburger and beans, Instant Porridge. All ration packs also contain Oatmeal Block, Fruit Biscuits, Biscuits Brown (a more compact alternative to bread), a sachet of instant soup and jam or yeast extract (a Marmite like spread) for a lunchtime snack, and chocolate (in the form of a specially made Yorkie bar which is flatter than civilian bars, or, more recently, a simple unbranded bar of milk chocolate), though this has been phased out with the introduction of the more recent multi-climate ration packs, and boiled sweets (hard candy) for snacking whilst on patrol, or in free time. Main Meal: Instant soup, Chicken with Mushroom and Pasta, Treacle Pudding. Each pack also contains instant coffee, tea bags, creamer, sugar, hot cocoa mix, beef/vegetable stock powder, lemon/orange powder or Lucozade electrolyte powder, matches, packet of tissues, chewing-gum, a small bottle of Tabasco sauce, and water purifying tablets. They sometimes also contain chicken and herb pâté. Also available are Kosher/Halal, Vegetarian, and Hindu/Sikh specific menus. Regardless of their contents, these ration packs are referred to as Rat-Packs or Compo (short for Composite Rations) by the soldiers who eat them. In addition to containing the 24-hour ration, the outside of the cardboard box has a range card printed on its side for use by the soldier to record key features and their range from their position. Other variations designed for specific environments exist.\n\nThe rations are now being issued with a new folding cooker and fire-lighting fuel called FireDragon made in Wales by BCB International Ltd\n\nThe 24 Hour Jungle ration is based on the standard 24 Hour ration with additional supplements and a Flameless Ration Heater (FRH). The Jungle ration is designed for use by the special forces and other specialist units.\n\nThe 24 Hour Jungle Ration provides a minimum of 4500 kcals (18,840 kJ) a day.\n\nThe Cold Climate Ration (CCR) is a specialist and lightweight, high calorie 24 hour ration designed for use by troops above the snow line or in the high Arctic. It comprises mainly dehydrated main meals with a range of snacks designed to be eaten on the go.\n\nThere are 8 menu choices available.\n\nThe cold climate ration provides a minimum of 5500 kcals (23,030 kJ) a day.\n\nThe UK also fields a larger pack of rations intended to feed ten soldiers for 24 hours from centralised but basic preparation; generally similar in content to the single issue ORP but tending to contain larger quantities of food in cylindrical tin cans to be divided up on preparation, rather than individual retort pouches or packets. Even dry materials like sugar or biscuits are often packed in these cans. They contain ingredients for baking bread and tinned food, including vegetables, corned beef and sausages in lard. Also included are chocolate, pre-cooked chicken or beef in gravy and soya mince. Ten boxed one-man ORPs are supplied in larger boxes identical in shape to the single ten-man pack.\n\nThe Mark 4 EFR is designed for crews of fast jets. It consists of a flat tin it contains 100 g of fruit flavoured sweets, (9 to be eaten each day) 2 spring handles and a plastic bag. The container can be used for boiling water and hot drinks can be made by dissolving the sweets in hot water. The Mark 4 EFR is built into ejector seats.\n\nThe Mark 9 EFR is designed for crews of multi-engine aircraft. It consists of a two piece aluminium container, four wire spring handles, two emergency food packs (eight portions per pack), one packet of beef stock drinking cubes (six cubes per pack), two packets of sugar cubes (twelve cubes per pack), one beverage pack (containing seven sachets of instant coffee, four sachets of instant tea and seven sachets of vegetable creamer), two spatulas, one polythene bag and an instruction leaflet.\n\nThe cost of a 10-man ration pack is £55.00. The cost of a 24-hour operational ration pack is £10.00\n\nIn 1943, The 24 Hour Ration was devised as a direct replacement to the 48 Hour Mess tin ration. It contained only dried goods (no tins), to save weight and tinplate, which was the criticism of the earlier mess tin ration. It was first issued to troops on D-Day to provide interim food prior to supply lines being established which would permit 14 Man Composition Rations being brought ashore.\nThere were two packs (contents identical), the standard 24 Hour Ration and the 24 Hour Ration (Assault), the former fitting into the larger portion of the mess tin and the latter fitting into the smaller portion. The pack provided approximately 4000 calories.\nThe contents of the ration pack were as follows, most of which were wrapped in either cellophane or in white, heat-sealed wax paper with royal blue writing;\n\n1 Block of dried meat (beef or lamb),\n2 sweetened oatmeal blocks,\nTea, Milk and sugar cubes,\n10 biscuits (plain, service),\n2 bars of raisin chocolate,\n1 bar of vitamin enriched chocolate (vit. A, B, C, D and Calcium),\n4 ounces of boiled sweets,\n2 packets of peppermint chewing gum,\n4 meat extract cubes,\n4 cubes of sugar,\nSalt,\n4 sheets of Latrine paper.\n\nInformation taken from DSIR 26-344 ration specifications, 1944 and Supplies and Transport, 1954.\n\nThe 24 hour GS (General Service) ration pack was supplied with the contents in cans or packets.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Biscuits AB stands for \"Biscuits-Alternative Bread\", these were called more colourful names by members of the British Army due to the fact they caused constipation.\n\nThe 24 hour GS (General Service) ration pack was supplied with the contents in cans or packets.\nArctic rations were dehydrated and issued to troops serving in arctic areas where snow could be melted to rehydrate the dehydrated contents.\nIn the 1990s cans were replaced with retort pouches and menu options improved and expanded. The ration was redesignated as the 24 Hour General Purpose (GP) Ration Pack.\n The Ukrainian combat ration is based on a previous Russian version, consisting of commercially available cans and dried foods packed together in a sectioned box (resembles a takeout tray) made of very thin green plastic. Inside are: two 250 g mmin Meal cans (boiled buckwheat groats and buckwheat w/beef); two 100 g cans of meat spread (liver pate and beef in lard); a 160 g can of herring or mackerel; six 50 g packages small, hard crackers (resemble oyster crackers); two foil pouches (20 g each) of jam or jelly; six boiled sweets two tea bags; an envelope of instant cherry juice powder; a chicken flavour bouillon cube; two packets of sugar; and three dining packets, each with a plastic spoon, a napkin, and a moist towelette.\n\nDeveloped and fielded the Ração Individual de Combate (RIC). Packed in a camouflage cardboard box measuring 265 mm × 160 mm × 90 mm (10.5 in × 6.25 in × 19.0 in) and weighing 1.99 kg (3.4 lb), the ration provides 3 meals per day. Maximum use is made of off-the-shelf commercial items, including canned main menu items (still with their original labels). A typical RIC (menu 4) will contain: two 415 g \"poptop\" cans (beef w/vegetables and chili con carne), a flat 115 g can of sardines, round 65 g can of liver paste, sweet bread, crackers, packaged bread, 2 pouches of fruit jam, pouch of quince cream, hot chocolate or instant coffee, isotonic drink mix, instant milk powder, chewing gum, boiled sweets, sugar, salt, water purification tablets, matches, 6 fuel tablets, a folding stove, plastic cutlery, a pack of tissues, a plastic bag, and an instruction/menu sheet.\n\nThe Israeli \"battle ration\" (Manat Krav) is designed to be shared by four soldiers. It contains: 1 can of rice filled vine leaves, 8 small cans of tuna, canned olives, a can of sweet corn, a can of pickled cucumbers, 1 can of halva spread and 1 chocolate spread, a can of peanuts, fruit flavored drink powder, and bread or matzoh crackers. There is also an \"ambush pack\" of candy and high-energy protein bars.\n\nIn 2008, Israel introduced a new field ration to supplement the traditional Manat Krav. Unlike previous rations, the new Battle Ration consists of individual, self-heating, ready-to-eat meals packed inside plastic-aluminum trays. They are designed to be carried and used by infantry troops for up to 24 hours, until regular supply lines can be established. Ten menus are available, including chicken, turkey and kebab; each meal pack is supplemented with dry salami, dried fruit, tuna, halva, sweet roll, and preserved dinner rolls. However, as of 2012, the older rations were still in use.\n\nIn 2011, as a result of the manufacturer going bankrupt, the IDF phased out the can of corned beef (known as 'Loof'), which had been part of the battle ration since the nation's founding. It would be replaced by \"ground meat with tomato sauce\".\n\nMany different recipes and different ways of serving the rations have developed in Israel. With the can of tuna, for example, traditionally cooked using toilet paper soaked in oil.\n\nSaudi Arabia uses a combat meal that is packed inside a brown plastic bag about the size and shape of a US MRE pouch. It contains a small can of tuna, a small can of sardines or salmon or beef, a small can of cheese or thickened cream, an envelope of instant noodle soup, hard crackers and dry toast (like Zwieback), a small bag of raisins or dried fruit, a small package of dates, a small bag of nuts, plus instant coffee, tea bags, sugar packets, matches, and a bag of spiced dried chickpea powder.\n\nThe UAE utilizes a European-style combat ration pack containing food and accessories for one soldier for 24 hours. Packed in the UAE utilizing imported components, the ration box measures 245 mm × 195 mm × 115 mm and weighs 2.0 kg. Inside are 4 resealable (ziplock type) plastic bags, labeled in both Arabic & English, containing Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Miscellaneous.\n\nA typical Breakfast bag has 2 foil-wrapped packages of hard brown biscuits, 1 small jar of apricot jam, a can of tuna, and an accessory pack (plastic spoon, salt, pepper, and napkin).\n\nLunch contains a retort pouch of precooked rice, a retort pouch of chicken curry, a pouch date pudding, and another accessory pack.\n\nDinner has a retort pouch of pasta rigatoni, an envelope instant soup, and a third accessory pack.\n\nThe Miscellaneous bag contains a small bag of hard candy, 4 packets of sugar, 4 tea bags, 2 small envelopes of milk powder, and 3 foil envelopes of instant orange juice powder.\n\nAlso included are: a can of fruit, a package of ramen noodles, 2 flameless chemical ration heaters, a menu/instruction sheet, 1 pack dried hummus powder, and a book of matches.\n\nAustralia currently supplies three different types of military ration packs – Combat Ration One Man, Combat Ration Five Man and Patrol Ration One Man.\n\nCombat Ration One Man is a complete 24-hour ration pack that provides two substantial meals per day and a wide variety of drinks and snacks for the remainder of the day. Most items, such as Beef Kai Si Ming, Dutch-style Beef with Vegetables, Beef with Spaghetti, Baked Beans, Sausages with Vegetables, or Chicken with pasta and vegetables, are packed in 250 gram sized plastic-foil retort pouches. Included with every meal pack is a pouch of instant rice or instant mashed potatoes, a fruit and grain bar, 2 envelopes of instant drink powder, some biscuits, an \"Anzac Biscuit\", a chocolate bar, M&M's, coffee, tea, sugar, crackers, cheese spread, jam, sweetened condensed milk, hard sweets, and Vegemite. It is packed in a tough clear polyethylene bag and weighs around 1.5–1.7 kg (3.3–3.75 lb). In practical use, these packs are \"stripped\" by removing and trading with other soldiers, those components that are unlikely to be consumed by the person carrying the pack. This also reduces the weight of the packs, allowing more to be carried. There are eight menu choices, one of which is vegetarian. None of them are allergen free since Defence Force members are typically selected, among many other attributes, for their no known allergy status.\n\nCombat Ration Five Man contains a similar array of components as the Combat Ration One Man. However, it is provided in a tough fibreboard carton rather than in individual unitised polyethylene bags. It is a group feeding solution, and it is impractical to use on an individual basis for main meals. There are a multiple of group-sized retort pouches – 500 gram as opposed to 250 gram, several of which are required to be heated in order to provide a complete meal. Examples include Beef & Blackbean Sauce, Chicken Satay. Common elements include rice and vegetables such as corn, potatoes and carrots. The accessories such as snacks are consumable and can be carried individually. There are five menu choices, and each Combat Ration Five Man weighs around 10 kg (22 lb).\n\nPatrol Ration One Man is a complete 24-hour ration pack that contains freeze dried main meals, meaning that the total weight of each pack is reduced, however a correspondingly higher quantity of water must be carried in order to reconstitute the main meal. Otherwise, it is similar to the Combat Ration One Man. It is packed in tough clear polyethylene bags and is available in five menu choices.\n\nNew Zealand issues an Operational Ration Pack designed to provide one soldier with three complete meals. Based around two ready-to-eat retort pouches (e.g. Lamb Casserole, Chicken Curry), the ORP comes in 4 menus. Also included are: Anzac biscuits, chocolate bars, URC fruit grains, muesli bars, instant soup powder, instant noodles, muesli cereal, a tube of condensed milk, hard crackers, tinned cheese, cocoa powder, instant coffee, tea bags, instant sport drink powder, sugar, salt, pepper, glucose sweets, Marmite, jam, ketchup, onion flakes, waterproofed matches, a resealable plastic bag, and a menu sheet.\n\nThe Patrol Ration Pac (PRP) is a shelf-stable product that provides an efficient, flexible and nutritionally robust feeding method. The PRP is designed to cover activities when you have access to other food sources during the day and is ideal to replace a single meal or provide snack options. The PRP provides approximately one-third of the energy and nutrient requirements of most military personnel during moderate, prolonged-intensity physical activity, in a temperate environment. Therefore, it is desirable that all of the food in the pack is eaten.\n\nMenus A, B and C contain main meals that can be heated using a flameless ration heater along with other ready to eat foods and a beverage powder. Menu D provides ready to eat snack foods and no beverage powder.\n\nThe Royal Brunei Army uses a 24-hour ration pack that provides a soldier with an entire day's supply of food, plus a limited number of health and hygiene items. Maximum use is made of plastic-foil laminate pouches, and most items can be eaten without further preparation. Currently, four menus are fielded, and all menus are compatible with Muslim dietary restrictions. Example Menu (F): 5 x 170-gram retort pouches (Biriani Chicken, Mutton Curry, Sardines in Tomato Sauce, Bubur Jagong/ Corn Porridge, Pineapple Pajeri); plus individual servings of pineapple jam, instant coffee, teabags, sugar, salt, pepper, steminder powder, hot chili sauce, MSG, a multivitamin energy tablet, tissue paper, scouring pad with soap, and matches.\n\nIndian Armed Forces have a host of Meals Ready To Eat (MRE) including the One Man Combo Pack Ration, Mini Combo Pack, Survival Ration, a ration for marine commandos and Main Battle Tank (MBT) Rations. The shelf-life of the ration is 12 months. India has adopted retort processing technology for combat rations.\n\nThe MREs use pre-cooked thermostabilized entrees in a plastic-foil laminate retort pouch. The ration does not require cooking and the contents may be eaten cold, though warming is preferred. An entire day's worth of food, plus accessory items, is packed inside a heavy-duty olive green plastic bag with pasted on label. The menu consists of several different Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian products that cater to Indian tastes, such as \"sooji halwa\", \"chapaties\", tea mix, chicken biryani, chicken curry, mutton biryani, Mutton curry, Vegetable biryani, \"rajma\" curry, \"dal\" fry, \"jeera\" rice, Dal makhani, vegetable \"pulav\" and mixed vegetable curry, alongside pickled hot seasoning, in small plastic pouches.\n\nThe One Man Combo Pack consists of early morning tea, breakfast, mid morning tea, lunch, evening tea, and dinner. The menus feature both dehydrated and ready-to-eat products, and include a folding stove and hexamine fuel tablets. The ration weighs 880 grams and provides . The Mini Combo Pack is a simplified version of the One Man Combo Pack, weighing 400 g and providing .\n\nThe survival ration consists of a soft bar and \"chikki\". The daily survival ration per man consists of: Soft bar 100 g x 2, Chikki (sugar base) 50 g x 3, Chikki (Jaggery base) 50 g x 3. This provides around , which is more than the normal survival ration used by most nations.\n\nUniquely, India also developed an operational ration pack specifically for Main Battle Tank (MBT) and other Armored vehicle crews. Designed to sustain four soldiers for 72 h in closed-in battle conditions, the MBT ration is based on instant/ready to eat foods and ration/survival bars. First and second day ration packs weigh 2 kg each and provide per soldier, while the third day ration pack weighs 1.5 kg and supplies .\n\nThe Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) has introduced the \"Ransum TNI\" (Indonesian for \"TNI ration\") in the mid-1970s in order to standardize nutrition for soldiers in field. There are three types of ration and each daily ration consist of three menus (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), a pack of supplementary drinks, providing approximately in total. Primary menus are often fried rice, often with regional variants such as Javanese or Balinese fried rice. The supplementary drinks are instant coffee, powdered fruit juice or vitamin supply, tea bags and powdered milk. All rations should be heated for 10–15 minutes over fire with the included stove and solid fuel tablets (for canned meals), or by submerging in boiling water (for meals packed in retort pouches). Virtually all products are made in Indonesia and manufactured according to Indonesian military standard.\n\nThe Japan Self-Defense Forces utilize two types of combat rations, Type I combat ration (戦闘糧食 I型) and Type II combat ration (戦闘糧食 II型). The older Type I ration consists almost entirely of canned foods weighing a total of 780 g per meal; a normal three-day ration has up to 36 cans weighing more than 7 kilograms. Eight menus are available, based around a 400 g can of rice and 2–3 smaller supplemental cans. Typical contents include: rice (white rice, sekihan (rice with red beans), mixed rice with vegetables, or rice with mushrooms), a main meal can (chicken and vegetables, beef with vegetables, fish and vegetables, or hamburger patties), pickled vegetables (Takuan(yellow radish) or red cabbage) and sometimes a supplemental can (tuna in soy or beef in soy). In the latest type I combat rations, cans have been replaced by retort pouches.\n\nThe newer, lighter Type II ration was originally intended to replace the Type I and consists of pre-cooked, ready-to-eat items in plastic-foil laminate retort pouches, packed in turn inside a drab green polyethylene meal bag. Each meal consists of two 200 g pouches of rice (white rice, rice with red beans, mixed rice with meat and vegetables, fried rice, curried rice pilaf, rice with green peas, or rice with wild herbs) plus 2–3 supplementary pouches. Main meal pouches contain: hamburger patties, frankfurters, beef curry, grilled chicken, Chinese meatballs, Sweet and Sour pork, grilled salmon, Yakitori chicken, mackerel in ginger sauce, chicken and vegetables, and tuna.

Most items are domestically procured and cater to local tastes and religious dietary requirements. The ration makes extensive use of commercially available canned and dehydrated items. Wherever possible, plastic-foil pouches are used instead of cans. The ration is supplemented with precooked or freeze-dried rice. Example menu C: Beef Kurma, Chicken Masak Merah, Fish Curry, and Sambal Shrimp; Bean Curd and Vegetable mix; long bean stew; canned pineapple and canned papaya; 2 packages of quick-cooking porridge (black bean porridge and flour porridge); military biscuits; jam; instant coffee; tea; instant milk powder; sugar; salt; vitamin tablets; matches; and napkins.\n\nThe Chinese People's Liberation Army has introduced a new set of rations in 2018 consisting of pre-packaged single-person meals sealed in hard plastic retort pouches. The Chinese military rations are of two types: Instant Meal Individual (three-item menu) and Self-Heating Individual (twelve-item menu) (Type 13 and 09). A typical Chinese breakfast ration contains roughly and includes a compressed food packet, an energy bar, an egg roll with pork, pickled mustard tuber, and a powdered beverage pack. Each Self-Heating package comes with an insulated flameless heater that is activated by water.\n\nThe Philippine Army formerly had a combat ration similar to those of the United States Army. Typically, they include a small can of sardines or tuna, instant noodles, crackers, instant coffee, a small packet of peanuts, ginger tea, and a biscuit or cookie. Chocolate manufactured for hot conditions are sometimes issued. Canned rice is also issued.\n\nIn 2016, it was announced that the Armed Forces of the Philippines will get new \"Ready-to-Eat\" rations. They are packed in green plastic retort pouches, and are halal to be considered fit to eat for Muslim service members. Menu no 2 for example, has four packs of cooked rice, one tuna rice with sisig, one pack of chicken sausage with sauce, one pack of chicken lechon paksiw, one pack of powdered milk, one pack of 3-in-1 coffee, one plain cracker, a sfork, and wet tissues.\n\nThe Singapore Armed Forces issues three types of combat rations – Type M (Muslim), Type N (Non-Muslim), and Type V (Vegetarian). Each type comes in 4 or 5 different menus, packed in a heavy-duty green plastic bag similar to a US MRE bag, but measuring 205 mm x 190 mm x 115 mm (8\" x 7.5\" x 4.5\") and weighing 1.5 kg (3.3 lb). Most items are retort-pouched (in the form of a watery paste and eaten straight from the pouch) and (except for the hot beverages) can be eaten without further preparation.

This ration is shelf stable and may require water to rehydrate some of the contents. The contents may be eaten hot or cold. General purpose individual operational rations are intended to be used during standard military operations in very broad but typically moderate operational conditions.\"\n\nThe shelf life of the ration from the time of delivery to the contracting authority must be at least 24 months at a storage temperature of 25 °C.\n\nNATO bases the nutritional content requirement on a reference soldier weighing 79 kg (174 lb, 12 St), who on normal operations would have an energy expenditure of approximately 3,600 kcal per day. For combat operations, i.e., missions involving sustained, dismounted light-infantry or Special Forces operations energy expenditure is estimated to be 4,900 kcal per day, however this is seen to be a worst-case scenario. Operational individual rations are designed to be used for a period of 30 days after which supplements of fresh food be given and medical screening for nutritional deficiencies be increased.\nTo avoid menu fatigue resulting from lack of variety in the ration, all 24-hour operational rations should, at a minimum, include:\nThe 21-meal, 7-day menu cycle shall offer sufficient variety to at least allow a soldier to have two different meals each day for a period of 7 days, without repetition, although a breakfast meal and a variety of small snack and beverage items may be repeated. It is recommended that coffee and/or tea be provided for each meal.\n\nIt is desirable that the main course components and hot beverages be provided with a heater to enable these components to be heated to at least 62 °C from an ambient temperature of 20 °C in maximum 12 minutes. However, main course components or entrées must be consumable without heating.\n\nIt is desirable that all necessary equipment to heat and consume an individual ration be included in the ration pack. Every ration or meal shall contain at least a spoon, unless all food items are intended as eat-out-of-hand and do not require any eating utensils for consumption.\n\nWater treatment items are not required in the individual ration pack. If any water treatment items are included in the individual ration packs, their primary packaging should clearly mention that these items are for water treatment only (and not for direct consumption).\n\nSome rations include a separate bag intended for collection and disposal of packing materials or packaging waste generated from consuming/using the ration components. However, if no separate refuse bag is provided with the ration, some portion of the ration packaging shall be usable or easily adaptable as a means to collect miscellaneous packaging waste that is generated.\n\nProtective packaging of components or items in a ration that are typically in contact with the product or food items is referred to as primary packaging. Secondary packaging is that packaging which is outside the primary packaging layer and in the case of general purpose individual operational rations this packaging is used to group several primary packages together. Lastly, tertiary packaging is that used to support bulk storage, shipping, and handling of product in the distribution supply chain. Rations are grouped at this level in fibreboard boxes or cases and subsequently palletised as unit loads for ease and efficiency of handling and distribution.\n\nIt is preferable that the packaging be easily opened without specific tools. If specific tools are required, they should be included in the ration pack, or alternatively a set should exist containing the ration pack and all necessary specific tools.\n\nPrimary and/or secondary packaging should be waterproof. Secondary packaging should be insect resistant. Tertiary packaging must be water resistant.\n\nIt is recommended that the rations be stacked on NATO type pallets (1200 x 1000 millimeters) for standardisation purposes. The minimum number of rations on a pallet position (i.e., on one single or on two stacked pallets) shall be 150 days of supply (DOS). The height and weight for a single pallet position, including the pallet(s), shall not exceed 2.2 meters and 1000 kg respectively. A pallet of rations must contain different menus.\n\n\n"}

During the Greek Civil War, he fought on the side of the DSE from 1948 up until 1949. After the war, Poulianos studied biology at Queens College, New York and then anthropology in Moscow.\n\nHe earned his Ph.D in Moscow under the supervision of anthropologist F. G. Debets in 1961 with a dissertation on \"The Origin of the Greeks\", a work based on anthropometric studies of a sample of present-day Greek people. In 1965, he returned to Greece as a researcher. In 1971, Poulianos founded the \"Anthropological Association of Greece\", which is now run by his son. This organization has had a long-standing dispute with the Greek Ministry of Culture, after the latter's attempts to evict the association from the excavation site in the Petralona Cave, which was conceded to them after a 1981 contract. In 1976, Poulianos founded the Department of Paleoanthropology-Spelaeology, which functions within the Greek Ministry of Culture.\n\nSince the 1970s, Poulianos has investigated early hominid remains found in a cave near Petralona, Greece, and has become known for controversial claims over their age. According to Poulianos, the Petralona Cave was accidentally discovered in 1959 by local villagers searching for a spring in the mountainside. The Petralona skull, specifically, was discovered in 1960 when it was removed from a rock in the cave. Early estimates at the time placed the age of the hominid remains to around 70,000 years old. Poulianos would ultimately study the remains, name the hominid \"Archanthropus europeaus petraloniensis\", and estimate its age to be around 700,000 years old.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the age of the Petralona hominid estimated by Poulianos was challenged by an article in \"Nature\". The scientists involved used electron spin resonance measurements and dated the age of the skull to between 160,000 and 240,000 years old (research based on the detailed analysis of the Cave's stratigraphy has proven that the original chronography of the skull is ultimately closer to the age of 700 000 years claimed by Dr. Poulianos). However, Poulianos states that his excavations in the cave since 1968 provide evidence of human occupation from the Pleistocene era. The Petralona hominid, specifically, was located in a stratigraphic layer containing the most amount of tools and traces of habitation. Poulianos states that the age of the overall layer is approximately 670,000 years old, based on electron spin resonance measurements. Further excavations at Petralona revealed two human skeletons that were dated to be 800,000 years old.\n\nToday, most academics who have analyzed the Petralona remains classify the hominid as Homo erectus. However, the \"Archanthropus\" of Petralona has also been classified as a Neanderthal (\"Homo neanderthalensis\") and as an early generic class of Homo sapiens. Some authors, on the other hand, believe that the Petralona cranium is derived from a unique class of hominids different from Homo erectus. Runnels and van Andel summarise the situation as such :\n\"The only known hominid fossil in Greece that may be relevant is the Petralona hominid, found by chance in 1960 in a deep cavern in the Chalkidiki. Controversy surrounds the interpretation of this cranium, and it has been variously classified as \"Homo erectus\", as a classic Neanderthal (\"Homo sapiens neanderthalensis\"), and as an early representative of \"Homo sapiens\" in a generalized sense (Day 1986: 91-95). The consensus among paleoanthropologists today is that the cranium belongs to an archaic hominid distinguished from \"Homo erectus\", and from both the classic Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans (Day 1986: 95; Stringer, Howell, and Melenitis 1979). Whatever the final classification may be, the cranium has been provisionally dated to ca. 200-400 kyr (Day 1986: 94 Hennig et al. 1981, 1982; Wintle and Jacobs 1982), and it is thus possible that the Petralona hominid represents the lineage responsible for the Thessalian Lower Paleolithic sites.\"\n\nIn September 1995, Poulianos presented a calcified tibia found in Triglia, Chalkidiki, which he claimed belonged to a Homo erectus form he termed \"Homo erectus trilliensis\", and which he dated to 11 million years before the present. Poulianos believes that his discovery may challenge the Out of Africa theory regarding human evolution.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was started in 1996 by Cyrille Guimard the former manager of Bernard Hinault, Greg LeMond and Laurent Fignon of the Renault-Elf-Gitane team of the 1980s. The team's sponsor has supported the team despite repeated problems such as doping scandals. After it was part of the UCI ProTour for the ProTour's first five seasons, from 2010 on the team competes as a UCI Professional Continental team. The team returned as part of the UCI World Tour for the 2020 season.\n\nCyrille Guimard started the team in 1996 with backing from François Migraine, the chief executive of Cofidis. An acquisition was Lance Armstrong, formerly of Motorola Cycling Team. Armstrong was dropped because of his cancer and another American, Bobby Julich, became leader for stage races. Julich's place in the top three of the 1998 Tour de France brought the team to the spotlight, and Frank Vandenbroucke brought further results in classics. That year, Cofidis won the team classification in the Tour.\n\nYears of drought followed as Julich and Vandenbroucke left the team. Vandenbroucke's Belgian compatriots, Nico Mattan, Chris Peers, Peter Farazijn, and Jo Planckaert, stayed on but were criticised for inconsistent performances. Cofidis, on the demand of Migraine, began paying riders by results, judged by the points they won in a season-long competition run by the Union Cycliste Internationale. Belgian riders criticised the policy, saying it would lead riders to ride conservatively to be sure of good placings at the finish. They debated the issue publicly with the manager, Alain Bondue, and left.\nDavid Millar raised the team's profile by winning the prologue of the 2000 Tour de France, taking leadership of the team. Millar criticized the points system and the team relented.\n\nIn 2004 Cofidis had three world champions – Igor Astarloa on the road, David Millar in the individual time trial and Laurent Gané on the track. However, a doping scandal involving Millar and other riders led them to stop racing until it was resolved. Astarloa left the team. The investigation decided that doping was by individual riders and that the team was not involved. However, David Millar has since suggested otherwise, in a strongly worded interview with the BBC. In May 2004 the team announced that Bondue and team doctor Jean-Jacques Menuet had both resigned. The team then returned to competition for the 2004 Tour de France, in which Stuart O'Grady and David Moncoutié won stages, Moncoutié's on Bastille Day.\n\nFollowing the doping scandals, the team appointed Éric Boyer as team manager in 2005. Moncoutié won on Bastille day again in the 2005 Tour de France – the only French stage win – with O'Grady's help. However, a new signing, Sylvain Chavanel failed to win a stage or to make a strong impression.\n\nO'Grady and Matthew White left in 2006. Cédric Vasseur – often the road captain – also left. An early victory in Classic Haribo by Arnaud Coyot showed the team still had firepower. Cofidis won the first stage of the 2006 Tour de France with Jimmy Casper, in a chaotic sprint.\n\nFor 2007 the team signed Belgians Nick Nuyens and Kevin De Weert from Quick Step-Innergetic.\n\nOn 25 July 2007 Cofidis rider Christian Moreni failed his doping test after the 11th stage of the Tour de France. His blood contained traces of testosterone. Moreni acknowledged doping. The team withdrew from the Tour.\n\nIn 2008 the team enjoyed the most successful season of Boyer's time as manager, with Chavanel winning Dwars door Vlaanderen and Brabantse Pijl and Chavanel and Samuel Dumoulin both taking stage wins in that year's Tour de France.\n\nOn 29 September 2009, the UCI ProTour decided not to renew the ProTour licenses of Cofidis and Bbox Bouygues Telecom, due to poor results.\nIn 2012, the team received a wildcard invitation to the Tour de France, along with three other French-registered teams. A few days before the start of the race, Boyer was sacked as manager of the team, with Migraine blaming him for poor results: he was replaced by former , and directeur sportif .\n\nOn 10 July 2012, the first rest day in the 2012 Tour de France, French police raided the Cofidis team hotel, arresting French rider Remy Di Gregorio on suspicion of doping.\nFor the 2015 season the team announced it had signed 2014 Giro d'Italia points classification winner, Nacer Bouhanni, along with Dominique Rollin, Geoffrey Soupe and Steve Chainel.\n\nAfter a 2017 season during which the team only took 13 wins, in October of that year the team announced that Sanquer had been sacked, and that he would be replaced as manager by former Cofidis rider Vasseur.\nThe team returned to UCI WorldTour status in the 2020 season, and the team will using De Rosa bikes beginning from the 2020 season, ending their contract with Kuota.\n\n"}

It is a colorless, practically odorless, poisonous, and hygroscopic liquid with a sweetish taste. It is miscible in water, alcohol, ether, acetone, and ethylene glycol. DEG is a widely used solvent. It can be a contaminant in consumer products; this has resulted in numerous epidemics of poisoning since the early 20th century.\n\nDEG is produced by the partial hydrolysis of ethylene oxide. Depending on the conditions, varying amounts of DEG and related glycols are produced. The resulting product is two ethylene glycol molecules joined by an ether bond.\n\n\"Diethylene glycol is derived as a co-product with ethylene glycol (MEG) and triethylene glycol. The industry generally operates to maximize MEG production. Ethylene glycol is by far the largest volume of the glycol products in a variety of applications. Availability of DEG will depend on demand for derivatives of the primary product, ethylene glycol, rather than on DEG market requirements.\"\n\nDiethylene glycol is one of several glycols derived from ethylene oxide. Glycols related to and coproduced with diethylene glycol and have the formula HOCHCH(OCHCH)OH are:\nThese compounds are all hydrophilic, more so than most diols, by virtue of the ether functionality.\n\nDiethylene glycol is used in the manufacture of saturated and unsaturated polyester resins, polyurethanes, and plasticizers. DEG is used as a building block in organic synthesis, e.g. of morpholine and 1,4-dioxane. It is a solvent for nitrocellulose, resins, dyes, oils, and other organic compounds. It is a humectant for tobacco, cork, printing ink, and glue. It is also a component in brake fluid, lubricants, wallpaper strippers, artificial fog and haze solutions, and heating/cooking fuel. In personal care products (e.g. skin cream and lotions, deodorants), DEG is often replaced by selected diethylene glycol ethers. A dilute solution of diethylene glycol can also be used as a cryoprotectant; however, ethylene glycol is much more commonly used. Most ethylene glycol antifreeze contains a few percent diethylene glycol, present as an byproduct of ethylene glycol production.\n\nDespite the discovery of DEG’s toxicity in 1937 and its involvement in mass poisonings around the world, the information available regarding human toxicity is limited. Some authors suggest the minimum toxic dose is estimated at 0.14 mg/kg of body weight and the lethal dose is between 1.0 and 1.63 g/kg of body weight, while some suggest the LD in adults is of ~1 mL/kg, and others suggest this is the LD. Because of its adverse effects on humans, diethylene glycol is not allowed for use in food and drugs. The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations allows no more than 0.2% of diethylene glycol in polyethylene glycol when the latter is used as a food additive. The Australian government does not allow DEG as a food additive; it is only allowed at less than 0.25% w/w of DEG as an impurity of polyethylene glycol (PEG) even in toothpaste.\n\nDiethylene glycol has moderate acute toxicity in animal experiments. The LD for small mammals has been tested at between 2 and 25 g/kg, less toxic than its relative ethylene glycol, but still capable of causing toxicity in humans. It appears diethylene glycol is more hazardous to humans than implied by oral toxicity data in laboratory animals.\n\nAlthough there is limited information about toxicokinetics in humans, observations in mass poisonings and experimental studies suggest the following information:\n\nThe principal method of absorption is through oral ingestion. Dermal absorption is very low, unless it is administered on broken or damaged skin. After ingestion, DEG is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and distributed by the bloodstream throughout the body, reaching peak blood concentrations within 30 to 120 minutes. Once DEG reaches the liver, it is metabolized by enzymes.\n\nAt first, scientists thought that DEG metabolized into ethylene glycol, which is poisonous due to the metabolic production of glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid, and ultimately oxalic acid. The major cause of ethylene glycol toxicity is the accumulation of glycolic acid in the body, but the accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys can also lead to acute kidney failure. In the case of DEG, observations demonstrated there were no calcium oxalate crystal deposits in the kidneys, implying ethylene glycol is not on the DEG metabolic pathway. Rat models suggest DEG is metabolized in the liver by enzyme NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) into a hydrogen ion, NADH and 2-hydroxyethoxyacetaldehyde (CHO). Shortly after, 2-hydroxyethoxyacetaldehyde (CHO) is metabolized by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) into the weak acid 2-hydroxyethoxyacetic acid (HEAA) with chemical formula CHO. Later on, HEAA leaves the liver through the bloodstream, being partially filtered in the kidneys for elimination.\n\nBased on available literature, scientists suggest unmetabolized DEG and HEAA are partially reabsorbed through glomerular filtration. As a consequence, the concentrations of the weak acid HEAA and metabolites may cause renal delay, leading to metabolic acidosis and further liver and kidney damage.\n\nThe symptoms of poisoning typically occur in three characteristic intervals:\n\nFomepizole or ethanol should be quickly administered to prevent diethylene glycol being metabolized to the compound or compounds that cause the real damage.\n\n\nFor late diagnosis where ethanol or fomepizole is ineffective, because DEG has already been metabolized, hemodialysis becomes the only treatment available.\nHemodialysis might be administered alone or with ethanol or fomepizole.\n\nThe prognosis depends on prompt diagnosis and treatment due to the high mortality rate DEG intoxication produces. Patients who survive but develop kidney failure remain dialysis-dependent. All patients are likely to suffer significant morbidity.\n\nThe physical properties of diethylene glycol make it an excellent counterfeit for pharmaceutical-grade glycerine (also called glycerol) or propylene glycol, and has caused many deaths in different countries. Incidents include its use in China as a component of cheap toothpaste, and by winemakers in Europe as an adulterant to create a \"sweet\" wine.\n\nIn 1937, S.E. Massengill Co. (a Tennessee drug company), manufactured sulfanilamide dissolved with diethylene glycol, to create a liquid alternative of this drug. The company tested the new product, Elixir Sulfanilamide, for viscosity, appearance and fragrance. At the time, the food and drug laws did not require toxicological analysis before releasing for sale. When 105 people died in 15 states during the months of September and October, the trail led back to the elixir, and the toxic potential of this chemical was revealed. This episode was the impetus for the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. This law, though extensively amended in subsequent years, remains the central foundation of FDA regulatory authority to the present day.\n\nIn Cape Town, South Africa, seven children developed vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration, and died of kidney failure after administration of over-the-counter sedatives. Soon, patients started to present anuria, acidic breathing, hepatomegaly, and unresponsiveness. Patients were treated with fluid hydration and correction of acidosis, but some were not able to survive. Postmortem examination revealed damage in the kidneys and liver, and laboratory testing found DEG instead of propylene glycol in the sedatives.\n\nPatients being treated for burns developed sudden anuric kidney failure. Further investigation revealed all patients were treated with topical silver sulfadiazine ointment that contained 7 g/kg of DEG. This event caused the death of five patients.\n\nDuring the month of July 1985, Austrian wines were found to contain up to 1,000 parts per million of DEG, giving them a desirable sweetness. Austrian wine was banned in many countries and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms started to test all imported wine.\n\nIn November, \"The New York Times\" published a wine recall that the Federal Government released after the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms tested 1,000 bottles. 45 Austrian, 5 German and 12 Italian wines tested positive for DEG. Some wines contained less than 10 parts per million of DEG, a small amount that could not be detected by laboratory analysis in Europe. This triggered the installation of more sensitive laboratory equipment in Banafi laboratories, Italy, and stronger alcohol regulations in Austria.\n\nAfter recalling millions of wine bottles, the Austrian Government had no idea how to destroy the product. During September 1986, the Ministry of Public Works started testing a mixture of wine with salt to melt hazardous ice during winter. The primary results revealed that the mixture was more effective than using salt alone. The next year, an Austrian electric power plant (Österreichische Draukraftwerke) in Carinthia announced that technicians developed a way to produce energy through burning 30 million liters of contaminated wine.\n\nAt a hospital in Bombay, India, patients were admitted to be treated for diverse health problems. Doctors prescribed glycerine for its osmotic diuretic effect, but patients started to develop kidney failure. Fourteen patients received hemodialysis, but the treatment failed. The episode resulted in the deaths of 21 patients and the discovery of glycerin contaminated with 18.5% v/v of DEG.\n\nDuring the summer months, 47 children were admitted to the Jos University teaching hospital, Nigeria, with anuria, fever and vomiting. The children later developed kidney failure and died. All the children had received acetaminophen syrup to treat upper respiratory infections related with malaria. Once physicians identified a suspect paracetamol syrup, samples were shipped to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the U.S., which identified DEG. It was assumed that DEG was used as a substitute of propylene glycol, and this incident encouraged the Nigerian government to develop pharmaceutical quality control guidelines.\n\nIn Bangladesh between 1990 and 1992, 339 children developed kidney failure, and most of them died, after being given paracetamol (acetaminophen) syrup contaminated with diethylene glycol. The outbreak forced the government to ban the sale of paracetamol elixirs in December 1992, causing a decline of 53% in the admission of patients with kidney failure and an 84% decline in admissions by unexplained kidney failure.\n\nA propolis syrup manufactured by Huilen Laboratories in Buenos Aires, Argentina, contained between 24 and 66.5% DEG, and caused the death of 29 people.\n\nIn the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, diseases are not recognized unless they become large or unusual. Between November 1995 and June 1996, almost 109 children admitted to the University Hospital in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, presented with acute kidney failure. By June 1996, with no idea what was causing the epidemic, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Haiti representative contacted the World Health Organization (WHO, the parent agency of PAHO), and WHO requested that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigate.\n\nLead CDC investigator Dr. Katherine O'Brien conducted a case-control investigation, looking for potential clues to the epidemic. The study revealed a strong association between ingestion of two locally produced acetaminophen liquid products (Afebril and Valodon) and illness. Laboratory testing at CDC of samples taken from parents revealed significant contamination with DEG. The factory of the medication manufacturer, Pharval, was subsequently investigated by Dr. Joel Selanikio (also of CDC, and an Epidemic Intelligence Service classmate of Katherine O'Brien). Testing of medication samples taken from the factory samples by both CDC and by an independent commercial lab located in Miami, revealed contamination by DEG of 16.4% and higher. With the available technology of the era, the CDC determined the glycerin used in the syrup preparation was contaminated with approximately 24% DEG. As a result of the case-control findings, and subsequent investigation at the factory, public warnings were issued by the Ministry of Health and bottles of the two medications were taken from pharmacy shelves and destroyed. These measures quickly ended the advance of the epidemic. \n\nOnly 88 children deaths were recalled by doctors or had medical records. Nearly half of the victims were under the age of two.\n\nEnding June 1996, the FDA had discovered counterfeit glycerin traced back to Chemical Trading and Consulting (a German broker), which bought 72 barrels of the syrup from Vos B.V., a Dutch company. Vos records revealed the syrup had been bought from Sinochem International Chemicals Company through a German trader, Metall-Chemie. In July 1996, the American Embassy in China contacted Sinochem and requested a list of Chinese glycerin makers, but the company refused to reveal the names. It was not until September 1996 that Sinochem provided a name of the manufacturer of the tainted syrup. They identified Tianhong Fine Chemicals Factory as the manufacturer. While the FDA tried to find out Tianhong’s address, Chinese officials were reluctant to become involved. One year and a half after the FDA began to trace the poisonous shipments, an inspector, Ted Sze, finally visited the Tianhong Fine Chemicals Factory in Dalian, northeastern China. Once he was inside, there was nothing to do: the plant had already been shut down. The Dutch authorities assessed a $250,000 fine against Vos B.V., for not alerting anyone when they tested the syrup and found impurities.\n\nWang Guiping discovered how easy it was to enter China’s pharmaceutical supply business and earn extra money. Records also revealed that to fool buyers, Wang falsified his license and laboratory analysis reports.\n\nWang declared that after making the first order of counterfeit syrup, he swallowed some of it. Once verifying that he was fine, he shipped it to Qiquihar No. 2 Pharmaceutical in 2005. Some time later, Wang found a reference to diethylene glycol in a chemical book. After manufacturing a second batch of syrup containing diethylene glycol for Qiquhar Pharmaceutical, no taste-test was performed. The counterfeit syrup ended in ampules of Amillarisin A, a medication for gall bladder problems; special pediatric enema fluid; blood vessel disease injections; intravenous pain reliever; and an arthritis medication.\n\nIn April 2006, the Guangdong Province Hospital of Guangzhou began administering Amillarisin A to their patients. Soon thereafter, patients died after receiving the medication. Mr. Wang was caught and Qiquihar was shut down by the authorities. Besides Wang, five employees of Qiquihar were prosecuted.\n\nEnding September 2006, the Arnulfo Arias Madrid Hospital at Panama City was getting full with patients with contradictory symptoms. The symptoms seemed to match with Guillain–Barré syndrome, but these patients were also losing their ability to urinate, a symptom not related to Guillain–Barré. The death rate of this mysterious illness was nearly 50%, when hospital management decided to isolate all the patients with the illness in a large room and doctors could compare notes and theories. Soon, patients from other parts of the country started to arrive at hospitals. Doctors had no idea what was happening: the mysterious illness was attacking elderly citizens with hypertension and diabetes history. About half were receiving Lisinopril (a blood pressure medicine), and many did not remember clearly if they had been taking other drugs. Suspecting something wrong with Lisinopril, the medicine was removed from the pharmacies while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted lab analyses, revealing the blood pressure drug was safe; CDC epidemiologists were then invited to participate.\n\nWhen a patient admitted for a heart attack developed the mysterious illness at the hospital, Dr. Nestor Sosa, an infectious disease specialist, analyzed the medical record. Because patients treated with Lisinopril developed a cough (a common side effect of ACE inhibitors), they were prescribed an expectorant. Immediately, biological samples and the syrup were sent by jet to CDC for analysis. When urine analyses for a series of metals, pesticides or their metabolites resulted negative, CDC scientists recalled the Nigeria and Haiti incidents. The CDC employed modern laboratory equipment to analyze the samples and confirm the results: the samples contained approximately 8% v/v DEG. Later, raw glycerin was analyzed and results revealed 22.2% v/v DEG.\n\nThe Panamanian Government made a nationwide campaign, collecting around 6,000 bottles of cough syrup and three other products with the tainted glycerin manufactured by Social Security Laboratories. The 46 barrels of syrup were bought by Social Security Laboratories through a Panamanian middleman, Grupo Comercial Medicom, who bought the product from Rasfer Internacional, a Spanish company. In fact, Rasfer received the product from CNSC Fortune Way, which in turn bought it from the Taixing Glycerine Factory. At the request of the United States, the State Food and Drug Administration of China investigated Taixing Glycerine Factory and CNSC Fortune Way, but the agency concluded it is not under their jurisdiction because the factory is not certified to make medicine.\n\nTaixing sold the syrup as “TD glycerin”, wording that neither Chinese inspectors nor Spanish medical authorities comprehended. Unfortunately, Taixing used “TD” for the Chinese word , meaning “substitute”. A New York Times reporter tried to obtain a comment from CNSC Fortune Way at the CPhI worldwide (the world’s largest annual pharmaceutical convention) held in Milan, Italy, during 2007, but their representatives refused to comment.\n\nIn August 2009, the Supreme Court decided to send the diethylene glycol file to the Public Ministry for an extension. The following month, the Toxicology Department of the Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Science published a list of 1,155 names whose medicine bottles tested positive for DEG. Only approximately 3,000 bottles had been analyzed from the total 6,000 bottles collected. The fiscal attorney urged affected citizens to approach the Public Ministry to update the official legal file and for further medical analysis. Two months later, findings revealed that 145 were proven to die by DEG intoxication, but the DA still has to investigate 953 demands.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Taixing was closed by the Chinese government and CNSC Fortune Way, which is also owned by the Chinese government, was never sanctioned. In Spain, Rasfer International declared bankruptcy after the lawyer of Medicom filed a lawsuit of $400 million in July 2008. Spanish authorities are prosecuting Asunción Criado, general manager of Rasfer Internacional, S.A., and await Panamanian citizens, René Luciani (former Social Security Director) and Jéssica Rodríguez (former Purchase National Director) for their hearings. Meanwhile, in Panama, De la Cruz, legal representative of Medicom, remains in jail pending a trial. Seventeen other persons have also been charged related to this incident. Panama awaits the extradition of Criado for her hearing.\n\nPanama’s case made CDC set standardized methodology for DEG identification, hoping to have more timely response in future events. The agency also identified urinary DEG as a biomarker for DEG exposures. The United States Food and Drug Administration also issued an Industry Guidance Document “intended to alert pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmacy compounders, repackers, and suppliers to the potential public health hazard of glycerin contaminated with diethylene glycol (DEG)” and recommended appropriate testing procedures for the use of glycerin.\n\nDuring June 2011, the number of confirmed deaths according to the official list rose to 219 victims \n\nIn May 2007, a Panamanian named Eduardo Arias discovered a 59-cent toothpaste that was labeled containing DEG. Panamanian officials traced the toothpaste to a local company in the Colón Free Trade Zone. In fact, the company bought the product in China and had already re-exported toothpaste to Costa Rica, Dominican Republic and Haiti, making Panama kick off a local warning. For the end of the month, the Chinese government committed to investigate the “supposedly” tainted toothpaste that had been recalled in Panama and Dominican Republic, but stated that, as per an essay written in 2000, a toothpaste containing 15.6% was not dangerous.\n\nOn June 1, 2007, the FDA warned consumers to avoid toothpaste from China, although there was no information if these toothpastes had already entered the US, and started testing any imported Chinese toothpaste. Days later, Colgate-Palmolive found counterfeit toothpaste with its name, which was contaminated with DEG and found at dollar-type discount stores in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland. The toothpaste was labeled as “Manufactured in South Africa” and contained misspellings like \"isclinically\", \"SOUTH AFRLCA\" and \"South African Dental Assoxiation\". Although there were no reports of anyone harmed, several people in the eastern US reported experiencing headaches and pain after using the product. It was later discovered that a great number of tubes with poison ended up in hospitals for the mentally ill, prisons, juvenile detention centers, other hospitals and many other state institutions.\n\nIn July 2007, health authorities in the UK detected a counterfeit Sensodyne toothpaste on sale at a car boot sale in Derbyshire. Soon, other countries also recalling Chinese-made toothpaste were Belize, Canada, Mozambique, Saudi Arabia, New Zealand, Spain, Italy, Japan, and Ireland, plus an Indianapolis, Indiana US hotel-supplier that distributed Chinese toothpaste in Barbados, Belgium, Bermuda, Britain, Canada, Dominican Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Switzerland, Turks and Caicos, the United Arab Emirates and United States. What began as a local alert revealed a global problem in more than 30 countries and involving more than thirty brands. The world outcry made Chinese officials ban the practice of using diethylene glycol in toothpaste.\n\nEnding November 2008, infants started to die after developing unexplained fevers and vomiting.  Investigations revealed that all had taken a medicine called “My Pikin Baby”, a teething mixture tainted with diethylene glycol. The poison had caused the death of at least 84 Nigerian children between ages of two months and seven years.\n\nThe Nigerian government traced the diethylene glycol to an unlicensed chemical dealer in Lagos, who sold it to a local pharmaceutical manufacturer. Barewa Pharmaceuticals was shut down and the product was pulled off the shelves. They also arrested 12 people in connection with the incident. This being the second incident involving counterfeit glycerine, it prompted the Nigerian National Agency for Food And Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) to adopt zero tolerance for counterfeits.\n\nIn January 9th, a police report indicated quantities of the substance in beer from a brewery that could have poisoned 18 people. By 17th January, the police confirmed the fourth death from symptoms matching DEG poisoning.\n\nIn the first week of this year, around 17 children from Ramnagar in Jammu and Kashmir state were hospitalised, of them more than the half of them died of Kidney failure. The regional drug controller authorities after investigation found out that a faulty batch of Cough Syrup called Coldbest PC contained 34.97 per cent of Diethylene Glycol, which resulted in poisoning and subsequent renal failures. The product was recalled and post investigation the Drug Controller General of India VG Somani said at India Pharma 2020, that the GMP was not followed, and negligence was found during the production process itself. The Himachal Pradesh government is filing a criminal case against the company and its Executives.\n\n\n\n"}

He subsequently took a job as a laundry worker in Pointe-à-Pierre for five years but had ambitions to become a journalist. Later on, poems of his were published by the \"Trinidad Guardian\" in 1954. Yet it was not enough for him to secure a new job locally and Anthony decided to further his career in the United Kingdom.\n\nAnthony's voyage to the UK on board the \"Hildebrandt\" took place on December 1954. In England he held several jobs, including as a sub-editor at Reuters news agency (1964–68), while developing his career as a writer, writing short stories for the BBC radio programme \"Caribbean Voices\".\n\nIn 1958 he married Yvette Phillips and they had four children — Jennifer, Keith, Carlos and Sandra Anthony.\n\nFour years later, Anthony published his first book, \"The Games Were Coming\", a cycling story inspired by real events.

{"id": "2240717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2240717", "title": "Triethylene glycol", "text": "Triethylene glycol\n\nTriethylene glycol, TEG, or triglycol is a colorless odorless viscous liquid with molecular formula HOCHCHOCHCHOCHCHOH. It is used as a plasticizer for vinyl polymers. It is also used in air sanitizer products, such as \"Oust\" or \"Clean and Pure\". When aerosolized it acts as a disinfectant. Glycols are also used as liquid desiccants for natural gas and in air conditioning systems. It is an additive for hydraulic fluids and brake fluids and is used as a base for \"smoke machine\" fluid in the entertainment industry.\n\nTriethylene glycol is a member of a homologous series of dihydroxy alcohols. It is a colorless, odorless and stable liquid with high viscosity and a high boiling point. Apart from its use as a raw material in the manufacture and synthesis of other products, TEG is known for its hygroscopic quality and its ability to dehumidify fluids. This liquid is miscible with water, and at a pressure of 101.325 kPa has a boiling point of 286.5 degrees Celsius and a freezing point of -7 degrees C. It is also soluble in ethanol, acetone, acetic acid, glycerine, pyridine, aldehydes; slightly soluble in diethyl ether; and insoluble in oil, fat and most hydrocarbons.\n\nTEG is prepared commercially as a co-product of the oxidation of ethylene at high temperature in the presence of silver oxide catalyst, followed by hydration of ethylene oxide to yield mono(one)-, di(two)-, tri(three)- and tetraethylene glycols.\n\nTEG is used by the oil and gas industry to \"dehydrate\" natural gas. It may also be used to dehydrate other gases, including CO, HS, and other oxygenated gases. It is necessary to dry natural gas to a certain point, as humidity in natural gas can cause pipelines to freeze, and create other problems for end users of the natural gas. Triethylene glycol is placed into contact with natural gas, and strips the water out of the gas. Triethylene glycol is heated to a high temperature and put through a condensing system, which removes the water as waste and reclaims the TEG for continuous reuse within the system. The waste TEG produced by this process has been found to contain enough benzene to be classified as hazardous waste (benzene concentration greater than 0.5 mg/L).\n\nTriethylene glycol is well established as a relatively mild disinfectant toward a variety of bacteria, influenza A viruses and spores of \"Penicillium notatum\" fungi. However, its exceptionally low toxicity, broad materials compatibility, and low odor combined with its antimicrobial properties indicates that it approaches the ideal for air disinfection purposes in occupied spaces. Much of the scientific work with triethylene glycol was done in the 1940s and 1950s, however that work has ably demonstrated the antimicrobial activity against airborne, solution suspension, and surface bound microbes. The ability of triethylene glycol to inactivate \"Streptococcus pneumoniae\" (original citation: pneumococcus Type I), \"Streptococcus pyogenes\" (original citation: Beta hemolytic streptococcus group A) and Influenza A virus in the air was first reported in 1943. Since the first report the following microorganisms have been reported in the literature to be inactivated in the air: \"Penicillium notatum\" spores, \"Chlamydophila psittaci\" (original citation: meningopneumonitis virus strain Cal 10 and psittacosis virus strain 6BC), Group C streptococcus, type 1 pneumococcus, \"Staphylococcus albus\", \"Escherichia coli\", and \"Serratia marcescens\" Bizio (ATCC 274). Solutions of triethylene glycol are known to be antimicrobial toward suspensions of \"Penicillium notatum\" spores, \"Streptococcus pyogenes\" (original citation: Beta hemolytic streptococcus Group A ), \"Streptococcus pneumoniae\" (original citation: pneumococcus Type I), \"Streptococcus viridans\", and \"Mycobacterium bovis\" (original citation: tubercle bacilli Ravenel bovine-type). Further, the inactivation of H1N1 influenza A virus on surfaces has been demonstrated. The latter investigation suggests that triethylene glycol may prove to be a potent weapon against future influenza epidemics and pandemics. However, at least some viruses, including Pseudomonas phage phi6 become more infectious when treated with triethylene glycol.\n"}

From 1905 to 1922, Miklas was headmaster of the in Horn, a small town in the Lower Austrian Waldviertel region.\n\nWhile serving in his role for the Christian Social Party, he was, 1907, elected to the Imperial Council (\"Reichsrat\") parliament. Re-elected in 1911, Miklas held a parliamentary seat in the provisional assembly of German-Austria and in the Constitutional Assembly of the First Austrian Republic. A rare opponent of German nationalism, he declared himself against a closer connection with the Weimar Republic and played a pivotal role in adopting the red-white-red Austrian flag.\n\nIn 1919, Miklas was appointed state secretary in the Austrian government of Chancellor Karl Renner. From 1923 to 1928, he was the speaker of the National Council (\"Nationalrat\").\n\nOn 10 December 1928, the representatives of the Federal Assembly elected him President, which he served until the position ceased to exist ten years later.\nMiklas did not intervene, when on 4 March 1933 after a heated discussion in the \"Nationalrat\" parliament over a strike of federal railways employees Speaker Karl Renner as well as his deputies Rudolf Ramek and Sepp Straffner resigned their offices. The assembly was no longer capable for actions and decisions, which gave Miklas' party fellow Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss the pretext to declare the parliament's \"self-elimination\". The government obstructed any resumption of the session by massive presence of police forces as well as of paramilitary \"Heimwehr\" troops led by Emil Fey, a self-coup Thar enabled Dollfuss to rule by \"emergency decrees\" following the Article 48 example set by German President Paul von Hindenburg.\n\nThe president remained passive on 20 May, when the government established the Fatherland's Front as a prospective single-party, followed by the ban of the Communist Party, the Austrian branch of the Nazi Party and the Social Democratic \"Republikanischer Schutzbund\" paramilitary organisation. The prohibition of the \"Arbeiter-Zeitung\" (Worker's Newspaper) and the measures against the Austrian labour movement led to the outbreak of the Austrian Civil War on 12 February 1934. As a result, also the Social Democratic Party was banned and the Austrofascist ideology finally realized with the implementation of the Federal State of Austria (\"Ständestaat\"). The authoritarian measures had no effect on the office of the President. In his private records, Miklas clearly condemned the violation of the constitution by Dollfuss and his successor Kurt Schuschnigg, but he did not openly criticise the government's policies.\n\nMiklas was highly unpopular among Austrian Nazis, as he refused to commute the death sentences imposed on assassins of Dollfuss after the failed July Putsch in 1934. In view of the rising pressure by Nazi Germany, the Austrofascist state approached the Kingdom of Italy under \"Duce\" Benito Mussolini and the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1936, Miklas entertained Regent Miklós Horthy at Wörthersee.\n\nAfter Schuschnigg on 12 February 1938 had been summoned to the Berghof by Adolf Hitler to receive German demands, Miklas offered amnesty to the jailed Nazi members but initially refused to turn over the national police force to their leader Arthur Seyss-Inquart. However, when Hitler ordered Wehrmacht operations along the border, the president was forced to give in and installed Seyss-Inquart as Austrian Minister of the Interior.\n\nOn 9 March 1938, Schuschnigg announced a plebiscite on Austrian independence to be held within four days. In turn, on 11 March Hermann Göring demanded that Seyss-Inquart replace Schuschnigg as chancellor; otherwise, German forces would overrun Austria the following day. While a Nazi mob invaded the chancellery, Schuschnigg declared his resignation (\"yielding to force\"). Miklas again refused to appoint Seyss-Inquart but was not able to present a non-Nazi candidate. After Hitler received the confirmation from Mussolini that Italy would not interfere, he gave orders that German troops would invade at dawn the following day (\"Unternehmen Otto\"). Miklas capitulated at midnight, announcing that he had instated Seyss-Inquart as new chancellor. Seyss-Inquart hectically spoke on the phone with the Nazi authorities in Berlin, but it was too late. When German troops rolled over the border at dawn the next day, they met with no resistance by the Austrian Armed Forces and were largely greeted as heroes.\n\nMiklas, for his initial refusal, ended up under house arrest but was protected from Nazi mistreatment by the future Waffen-SS Colonel Otto Skorzeny during the days of the \"Anschluss\". With the promulgation of a \"law concerning the re-unification of Austria with the German Reich\" by Seyss-Inquart on 13 March, the offices of both the Austrian chancellor and of the Austrian president were terminated. While Schuschnigg was imprisoned, Miklas abandoned the political sphere and retired, receiving his pension unmolested.\n\nAfter World War II, Miklas refused to run again for presidency, in favour of Karl Renner.\n\nHe died on 20 March 1956 in Vienna.\n"}

The detail coefficients formula_4 are then interpolated using the values of formula_2 and the \"prediction operator\" on the even values:\n\nThe next stage (known as the \"updating operator\") alters the approximation coefficients using the detailed ones:\n\nThe functions prediction operator formula_8 and updating operator formula_9\neffectively define the wavelet used for decomposition.\nFor certain wavelets the lifting steps (interpolating and updating) are repeated several times before the result is produced.\n\nThe idea can be expanded (as used in the DWT) to create a filter bank with a number of levels.\nThe variable tree used in wavelet packet decomposition can also be used.\n\nThe SGWT has a number of advantages over the classical wavelet transform in that it is quicker to compute (by a factor of 2) and it can be used to generate a multiresolution analysis that does not fit a uniform grid. Using a priori information the grid can be designed to allow the best analysis of the signal to be made.\nThe transform can be modified locally while preserving invertibility; it can even adapt to some extent to the transformed signal.\n\n"}
{"id": "2240757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2240757", "title": "The Dam Busters (book)", "text": "The Dam Busters (book)\n\nThe Dam Busters is a 1951 non-fiction book by Paul Brickhill about Royal Air Force Squadron 617\nOriginally commanded by Wing Commander Guy Gibson V.C. during World War II. The squadron became known as the \"Dam Busters\" because of Operation Chastise, a mission using highly specialised bombs to destroy Ruhr dams in Germany.\n\nThe book also covers the subsequent history of 617 Squadron, as an elite squadron specializing in attacking difficult targets with outsize weapons and precision techniques. Among Gibson's successors as commander was Group Captain Leonard Cheshire V.C., and the book describes Cheshire's unorthodox leadership style and innovative target marking techniques.\n\nAfter the end of World War II John Nerney, head of the Air Historical Branch of the British Air Ministry identified the need for a history of 617 Squadron. He initially approached its former commanding officer Leonard Cheshire, who declined citing health issues and his work commitments running a hospice.\n\nCheshire recommended that McGowan Cradon be considered for the task. Cradon had served as intelligence officer with the squadron. in December 1946 Cradon was approached and agreed but his services were rejected by the RAF as senior officers questioned his commitment since, during the war, he had been too interested in flying on practice flights rather than attending to his duties.\n\nNerney then discussed the issue with John Pudney, who was an editor at News Review. Pudney had liked Paul Brickhill's book of World War II escape attempts \"Escape to Danger\" (which he had co-authored with Conrad Norton) and was at the time attempting to turn it into a series for BBC TV.\n\nFollowing up Pudney's recommendation, Nerney approached Brickhill in February 1949, who jumped at the offer. As an officer and a pilot in the RAF and a proven writer and journalist Brickhill was acceptable provided he could obtain written confirmation from the RAAF of his service with the RAF. Eventually this was received in March 1949.\n\nWhile doing all it could to assist his research the Air Ministry could only provided Brickhill with a small honorarium, and no guarantee of publication other than as a government produced publication. In an attempt to obtain an advance which would pay enough for him to leave his current job as a sub-editor at \"The Sun\" newspaper in Sydney, Australia and relocate to England Brickhill approached a number of Australian publishers to see if they were interested in an Australian edition of the book. None were interested so Brickhill was forced to decline Nerney's offer.\nAt the same time Brickhill had been approached by John Pudney who had recently joined London based publisher Evans Brothers as an editor with a proposal to write a book on the Stalag Luft 3 mass escape. This was eventually to be published as \"The Great Escape\".\nWith the advance that Evans Brothers offered Brickhill he left his job and sailed to England in May 1949.\n\nOnce in England he a wrote to Air Chief Marshall Sir Ralph Cochrane of the RAF who had been responsible for 617 Squadron during World War II and inquiring about the status of the proposed history offered his services if they were still required. His offer was accepted.\nBrickhill approached Evans Brothers about an advance for the Dam Busters book, but they were not interested in any advance until they had seen a manuscript. \nAlready working on \"The Great Escape\" Brickhill also commenced simultaneous work on \"The Dam Busters\".\n\nWhile visiting Germany as part of his research for \"The Great Escape\", Brickhill took the opportunity to visit the Ruhr valley to see the dams attacked during Operation Chastise.\n\nWhile he was obliged to write a history of the squadron, Brickhill looked for a common factor throughout its wartime service that would make it more attractive to the general public. As the squadron had had a number of commanding officers including Guy Gibson, Harold Martin and Leonard Cheshire this was not helpful in maintaining the continuity of the narrative. Eventually he discovered that not only was Barnes Wallis involved with the squadron in developing the bouncing bombs used during Operation Chastise but he had also designed the Grand Slam and Tallboy bombs used by the squadron later in the war. After meeting with Wallis in the summer of 1950 he decided that here was the book's central figure, a driven man who overcame great odds set against the tragedy of the heavy losses that the squadron endured.\n\nHe delivered the draft manuscript to Evans Brothers at the end of 1950.\n\nThe first (September 1951) edition did not include some of the details of the dam-raids, as these were still classified at the time, most significantly that the weapons bounced on the water surface before reaching the target. Later editions included these details. The book has remained continuously in print since then, selling over one million in its first 50 years. It was first released as a paperback by Pan in 1954. To coincide with the release of the film version it was serialized in the London Evening News. A simplified version for children was issued in 1958 and in 1972 a version for teenage boys with reading difficulties was issued.\nRichard Todd narrated an audio version of the book in 1982.\n\nIn 1954 a film \"The Dam Busters\" was made based on both Gibson's \"Enemy Coast Ahead\" (1946) and on Brickhill's book. Named after the latter, the movie starred Richard Todd as Gibson and Michael Redgrave as Barnes Wallis.\n\nIn 1954, Australasian Radio produced a radio dramatisation of the book in 26 half-hour episodes.\n\n\n"}

It is a collection of essays that discuss India's history and identity, focusing on the traditions of public debate and intellectual pluralism. Martha Nussbaum says the book \"demonstrates the importance of public debate in Indian traditions generally.\"\n\n\"The Argumentative Indian\" has brought together a selection of writings from Sen that outline the need to understand contemporary India in the light of its long argumentative tradition. The understanding and use of this argumentative tradition are critically important, Sen argues, for the success of India's democracy, the defence of its secular politics, the removal of inequalities related to class, caste, gender and community, and the pursuit of sub-continental peace.\n\nThe book takes the form of four sections containing linked essays: \"Voice and Heterodoxy\", \"Culture and Communication\", \"Politics and Protest\", \"Reason and Identity\". The first section looks at the general culture of pluralistic debate within India, dating back to Buddha and kings such as Ashoka. The second section seeks to restore the reputation of Rabindranath Tagore as an intellectual polymath, combining spiritual and political ideas, and explores India's relationship to other cultures, including the West and China, especially the peaceful and intellectually rewarding cross-fertilising relationship between the two great Asian cultures. The third section looks at conflicts of class and criticises inequalities in Indian society and arguments that have been used to justify them. Finally, the book explores modern cultures of secularism and liberalism in an Indian context.\n\nGordon Johnson, president of Wolfson College, Cambridge, and general editor of \"The New Cambridge History of India\", argues that Amartya Sen's political aim is to expose \"India's new cultural chauvinism\", which \"relates Indian identity to a particular sort of Hinduism\" fanning communal violence, before a dispassionate analysis of historical facts:\nJohnson questions several historical examples, e.g.\n\n"}

The name derived from the Greek king and later god Pelops, son of Tantalus. During the analysis of the mineral tantalite he concluded that it does contain an element similar to niobium and tantalum. The similar reactivity of niobium and tantalum complicated preparation of pure samples and therefore several new elements were proposed, which were later found to be mixtures of niobium and tantalum.\n\nThe differences between tantalum and niobium and the fact that no other similar element was present were unequivocally demonstrated in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand, and Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, as well as Louis J. Troost, who determined the formulas of some of the compounds in 1865 and finally by the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac.\n\nThis confusion arose from the minimal observed differences between tantalum and niobium. Both tantalum and niobium react with chlorine and traces of oxygen, including atmospheric concentrations, with niobium forming two compounds: the white volatile niobium pentachloride (NbCl) and the non-volatile niobium oxychloride (NbOCl). The claimed new elements \"pelopium\", \"ilmenium\" and \"dianium\" were in fact identical to niobium or mixtures of niobium and tantalum.\n"}

It is located in Ohio at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near Dayton. AFIT is a component of the Air University and Air Education and Training Command.\n\nFounded in 1919 and degree-granting since 1956, the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) is the Air Force's graduate school of engineering and management as well as its institution for technical professional continuing education. AFIT is located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB), Dayton, Ohio. Dayton's heritage and industrial base in aeronautics and aviation, coupled with the close proximity to the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) provide a scientific and engineering research and educational experience focused on producing future leaders of the Air Force. A component of Air University and Air Education and Training Command, its primary purpose is to provide specialized education to select officer and enlisted U.S. military personnel and civilian employees. The United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs is the undergraduate counterpart of AFIT for the Air Force.\n\nOn 8 May 2012, AFIT formally welcomed its first civilian director and chancellor during an appointment of leadership ceremony. Dr. Todd Stewart served for 34 years with the U.S. Air Force, retiring in 2002 at the rank of major general. On 28 January 2015, AFIT welcomed its first Provost and Vice Chancellor Dr. Sivaguru S. Sritharan former Dean of Engineering and Applied Sciences at the Naval Postgraduate School.\n\nAFIT's four schools include:\n\nAFIT has seven research centers funded by a number of federal agencies with interdisciplinary scope and international footprint representing a number of game changing scientific areas for the United States Air Force and the Department of Defense:\n\nAFIT's Graduate School of Engineering and Management is a graduate-only, research–based institution and the sole degree-granting element of AFIT. The Graduate School focuses on studies and research that are relevant to the Air Force mission as well as the needs of the defense establishment as a whole. AFIT's Aeronautics & Astronautics Department has graduated nine U. S. astronauts including Guy Bluford (PhD 1978), first African-American astronaut. Since graduate degrees were first granted in 1956, AFIT has awarded 19,619 master's and 898 doctor of philosophy degrees.\n\nThe Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) enrolls over 700 full-time graduate students. The student body consists primarily of Air Force officers, but is rounded out by members of the other four U.S. Armed Services, select enlisted Airmen, international students from coalition countries, U.S. Government civilians, and civilians (U.S. citizens) not affiliated with the Government. Selection of officers for graduate education is fully funded by their service and is based upon outstanding professional performance as an officer, promotion potential, and a strong academic background. Admission of non-Government affiliated civilians is based on academic preparation and requires U.S. citizenship. A substantial number of AFIT graduates are assigned to AFRL and NASIC upon graduation from AFIT. Many of the AFIT student thesis projects are influenced directly or indirectly by AFRL, NASIC, NRO and other Air Force and defense agencies.\n\nThe faculty body consists of approximately a 50–50 mix of military and civilian members all of whom hold a PhD in their fields. The faculty to student ratio is typically 1 to 5 in the master's degree programs.\n\nAFIT is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, 30 North LaSalle Street, Suite 2400, Chicago, Illinois 60602-2504 to offer degrees to the doctorate level. Eight engineering programs in the Graduate School of Engineering and Management are accredited at the advanced level by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).\n\nThe Institute operates year-round on a quarter calendar which includes the Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer terms. The quarters are 10 weeks in length plus a week for examinations. Typically, the Fall term begins in late September and ends in mid-December; the Winter term begins in early January and ends in mid-March; the Spring term begins in late March and ends in mid-June; and the Summer term begins in late June and ends in early-September.\n\nThe educational expenses for full-time military students assigned to AFIT are paid by their respective uniformed service. For tuition-paying students, the approximate cost is $4,212 per quarter for full-time enrollment (based on 12 quarter hours and a tuition rate of $351 per quarter-hour). AFIT is tuition-waived for civilian employees of the Department of Defense.\n\nThrough its Civilian Institution Programs, AFIT also manages the educational programs of officers enrolled in civilian universities, research centers, hospitals, and industrial organizations. Air Force students attending civilian institutions have earned more than 12,000 undergraduate and graduate degrees in the past twenty years.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was recruited by Pepperdine, USC, Oklahoma State, Cal State Fullerton and UCLA, choosing the Bruins. At UCLA, Atkins majored in sociology and became the first three-time All-American. He began as a first baseman before converting to third base, where he made 51 starts in . However, in , his sophomore campaign, Atkins played first base again and led the team in hits.

He struggled, hitting .226 with nine home runs, and 48 RBIs. With the emergence of Ian Stewart, Atkins became less of a priority in the Rockies long-term plans and was non-tendered on December 12, 2009, officially making him a free agent.\n\nAtkins agreed to a one-year, $4 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles for 2010.

After the Catholic League protested the comic and then MSU president M. Peter McPherson declared he wanted it banned, the comic strip was removed for being too controversial. During the controversy over the comic, many people protested on both sides of the issue.\n\nThose who were against the comic protested on religious grounds. One said, \"As a born-again Christian, I just wanted to notify the writers of “Fetus-X” that the comic strip [is] very offensive. ... I pray that one day you will come to know the power of the cross.\" Another warned, \"Do you remember what happened when they said, 'not even God can sink the Titanic?' There are certain things you just don’t joke about. ... keep your blasphemy to yourself.\"\n\nThose in favor of the comic said that \"I would not hesitate to liken 'Fetus-X' to the Black Sabbath of comic strips ... It is the courage, imagination and talent of both the band and the strip that will set them apart from the other flavors of the week and earn them both places in artistic history.\" And: \"It's frustrating to see the ultimate goal of political correctness gain precedence over the basic principle that Casey Sorrow and Eric Millikin have the artistic right to their own opinions.\"\n\nThe comic was also published in other student newspapers like the \"University Reporter\".\n\nIn 2012, Sorrow illustrated the first printed edition of James Joyce's \"The Cats of Copenhagen\", where Sorrow's pen and ink hand-drawings were made into clichés typographiques and printed on a rare American-built Vandercook SP 33 proofing press for the first edition.

His father was Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia, the youngest child of Emperor Alexander II. His mother was his father's mistress, Olga Valerianovna Karnovich, who was still married to Erich Gerhard von Pistohlkors at that time.\n\nIn 1902, Grand Duke Paul—-a widower after his short marriage to Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark, with whom he had two children before her premature death in childbirth-—wed Olga morganatically. In 1904, she was created Countess von Hohenfelsen by Prince Regent Luitpold of Bavaria, thus providing Vladimir with the title of Count Vladimir von Hohenfelsen. In 1915, Olga was created Princess Paley by Nicholas II, which allowed Vladimir to use the title of Prince Paley.\n\nPrince Vladimir had two elder half-siblings from his father's marriage to Alexandra Georgievna of Greece, \"née\" Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark: Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia and Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia. He had two full sisters, both of whom eventually were styled as Her Serene Highness Princess Paley: Irina Pavlovna and Natalia Pavlovna. He also had three half-siblings from his mother's first marriage: Alexander Erikovich von Pistohlkors, Olga Erikovna von Pistohlkors, and Marianna Erikovna (or Marianne) von Pistohlkors.\n\nHe spent his childhood in Paris and later graduated from the Corps des Pages, an aristocratic military school in Saint Petersburg. In December 1914, he entered the regiment of the Emperor’s Hussars and fought with the Russian army in the First World War. He was promoted to lieutenant and decorated as a war hero with the Order of Saint Anne.\n\nEven as a teenager, he showed remarkable talent as a poet. He published two volumes of poetry (1916 and 1918) and wrote several plays and essays, as well as a French translation of Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovitch's play, \"The King of the Jews\".\n\nIn the summer of 1917, he and his family were placed for a short time under house arrest by the Provisional Government, because of a poem he wrote about Aleksandr Kerensky. In March 1918, he was arrested by the Bolsheviks and sent to exile in Vyatka, and later in Ekaterinburg and Alapaevsk. He was brutally murdered in a mineshaft near Alapaevsk, together with his cousins Prince Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia, Prince Konstantine Konstantinovich of Russia, Prince Igor Konstantinovich of Russia, and other relatives. Their bodies were recovered by the Imperial White Army and placed in coffins, then moved around during fighting with the Red Army. They were brought and buried months later at the Russian Mission Orthodox cemetery in Beijing, China, the site of which was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and is now a parking area.\n\nA biography of Prince Vladimir Paley by Andrey Baranovsky was published in 1997 in Russian, and another (\"A Poet Among The Romanovs\") by Jorge F. Saenz was published in 2004, in both Russian and English.\n\n"}
{"id": "2240837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2240837", "title": "Abrupt climate change", "text": "Abrupt climate change\n\nAn abrupt climate change occurs when the climate system is forced to transition to a new climate state at a rate that is determined by the climate system energy-balance, and which is more rapid than the rate of change of the external forcing. Past events include the end of the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, Younger Dryas, Dansgaard-Oeschger events, Heinrich events and possibly also the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. The term is also used within the context of global warming to describe sudden climate change that is detectable over the time-scale of a human lifetime, possibly as the result of feedback loops within the climate system.\n\nTimescales of events described as 'abrupt' may vary dramatically. Changes recorded in the climate of Greenland at the end of the Younger Dryas, as measured by ice-cores, imply a sudden warming of + within a timescale of a few years. Other abrupt changes are the + on Greenland 11,270 years ago or the abrupt + warming 22,000 years ago on Antarctica. By contrast, the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum may have initiated anywhere between a few decades and several thousand years. Finally, Earth Systems models project that under ongoing greenhouse gas emissions as early as 2047, the Earth's near surface temperature could depart from the range of variability in the last 150 years, affecting over 3 billion people and most places of great species diversity on Earth.\n\nAccording to the Committee on Abrupt Climate Change of the National Research Council:\n\nThere are essentially two definitions of abrupt climate change:\n\n\nThese definitions are complementary: the former gives some insight into how abrupt climate change comes about ; the latter explains why there is so much research devoted to it.\n\nPossible tipping elements in the climate system include regional effects of global warming, some of which had abrupt onset and may therefore be regarded as abrupt climate change. Scientists have stated, \"Our synthesis of present knowledge suggests that a variety of tipping elements could reach their critical point within this century under anthropogenic climate change\".\n\nIt has been postulated that teleconnections, oceanic and atmospheric processes, on different timescales, connect both hemispheres during abrupt climate change.\n\nThe IPCC states that global warming \"could lead to some effects that are abrupt or irreversible\".\n\nA 2013 report from the U.S. National Research Council called for attention to the abrupt impacts of climate change, stating that even steady, gradual change in the physical climate system can have abrupt impacts elsewhere, such as in human infrastructure and ecosystems, if critical thresholds are crossed. The report emphasizes the need for an early warning system that could help society better anticipate sudden changes and emerging impacts.\n\nScientific understanding of abrupt climate change is generally poor. The probability of abrupt change for some climate related feedbacks may be low. Factors that may increase the probability of abrupt climate change include higher magnitudes of global warming, warming that occurs more rapidly and warming that is sustained over longer time periods.\n\nClimate models are unable yet to predict abrupt climate change events, or most of the past abrupt climate shifts. A potential abrupt feedback due to thermokarst lake formations in the Arctic, in response to thawing permafrost soils, releasing additional greenhouse gas methane, is currently not accounted for in climate models.\n\nMost abrupt climate shifts are likely due to sudden circulation shifts, analogous to a flood cutting a new river channel. The best-known examples are the several dozen shutdowns of the North Atlantic Ocean's Meridional Overturning Circulation during the last ice age, affecting climate worldwide.\n\n\nAbrupt climate change has likely been the cause of wide-ranging and severe effects:\n\nOne source of abrupt climate change effects is a feedback process, in which a warming event causes a change that adds to further warming. The same can apply to cooling. Example of such feedback processes are:\n\n\nIsostatic rebound in response to glacier retreat (unloading) and increased local salinity have been attributed to increased volcanic activity at the onset of the abrupt Bølling-Allerød warming. They are associated with the interval of intense volcanic activity, hinting at an interaction between climate and volcanism: enhanced short-term melting of glaciers, possibly via albedo changes from particle fallout on glacier surfaces.\n\nSeveral periods of abrupt climate change have been identified in the paleoclimatic record. Notable examples include:\n\n\nThere are also abrupt climate changes associated with the catastrophic draining of glacial lakes. One example of this is the 8.2 kiloyear event, which associated with the draining of Glacial Lake Agassiz. Another example is the Antarctic Cold Reversal, c. 14,500 years before present (BP), which is believed to have been caused by a meltwater pulse probably from either the Antarctic ice sheet or the Laurentide Ice Sheet. These rapid meltwater release events have been hypothesized as a cause for Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles,\n\nA 2017 study concluded that similar conditions to today's Antarctic ozone hole (atmospheric circulation and hydroclimate changes), ∼17,700 years ago, when stratospheric ozone depletion contributed to abrupt accelerated Southern Hemisphere deglaciation. The event coincidentally happened with an estimated 192-year series of massive volcanic eruptions, attributed to Mount Takahe in West Antarctica.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2240847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2240847", "title": "Tobal 2", "text": "Tobal 2\n\nAs of 2010, the game held the record for the largest character roster in a fighting game with a grand total of 200 playable characters to choose from, as well as a greatly expanded Quest Mode compared to its predecessor.\n\nThe fighting system in \"Tobal 2\" is the same as in the previous game. The player can freely navigate 3D fighting arenas under the condition that they face the opponent. High, medium, and low attacks can be executed using assigned buttons. As in \"Tobal No. 1\", the grappling and blocking system offers the player a variety of offensive and defensive maneuvers. An unblockable fireball attack has been added for each character. \"Tobal 2\" was released on the same day as Sony's Dual Analog Controller in Japan, noted as the first game compatible with the peripheral. Graphically, the game features Gouraud shaded and higher-resolution character models compared to \"Tobal No. 1\", but still runs at 60 frames per second.\n\nThe \"Quest Mode\" from \"Tobal No. 1\" makes a return in \"Tobal 2\". The game contains six dungeons (Practice Dungeon, Pyramid, Desert Spaceship, Molmoran Mine, Castle and Final Dungeon) to conquer. Unlike the dungeon-enclosed Quest Mode of the original, it also offers an explorable town that allows the player to eat, sleep, and shop. In each floor of the dungeons, the player will battle against a variety of monsters. When defeated, the monsters will drop either food, stones, potions, money or weapons. As the player progresses through the game, the character gains experience for each body part or type of attack (the most important being each arm, each leg, throwing and guard). The higher the level of the characters arms and legs and throw, the more damage an attack using that part will yield. Similarly, the higher the guard level, attacks on the character will yield less damage. Both attack and defence levels can be increased/decreased by potions and stones. Guard experience can also be accumulated by eating food when the stamina bar is (nearly) full.\n\nUsing a special item, the player can capture monsters in Quest Mode for use in the versus fighting mode, making the number of playable characters a maximum of 200. Some monsters are unique, such as the chocobo, but many of them are palette swaps with attributes raised for higher level monsters. Monsters can be captured by throwing a purple stone at them when they are nearly defeated. The progress of the game can be saved using the church buildings in the town, and the character (consisting of additional data such as max hit points and attack/defence levels) can be used in the arcade and versus mode.\n\nLike the first game, the characters in \"Tobal 2\" were designed by Akira Toriyama.\n\n\"Tobal 2\" was to be released in North America, with a planned launch date of March 7, 1998, but the release was cancelled. It would have been the sixth and last title to be part of Square's publishing deal with Sony Computer Entertainment America; the companies instead opted to release \"Einhänder\". According to a Square official, the game was not localized due to the disappointing sales of \"Tobal No. 1\", and the assumption that most of the people who did buy it only did so for the included playable demo of \"Final Fantasy VII\". Square also stated that because they were working on the translations for \"Final Fantasy VII\" and \"Bushido Blade\", they lacked the time and resources to translate a text-heavy game like \"Tobal 2\", and their publishing deal with Sony prohibited them from contracting translations of their games to third-party companies. However, according to a feature in the February 2006 issue of \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\", Square representatives claimed that the game was not released because the PlayStation's limited memory prevented the English dialogue from fitting in the game's text boxes. A fan translation was completed little more than three years prior to Square's official statement.\n\nThe \"Tobal 2 Original Sound Track\" was scored by Takayuki Nakamura. Like the soundtrack for the game's predecessor, it includes a fusion of many different styles such as jazz, funk, and rock and roll. When asked in an interview concerning the soundtrack who he was most influenced by, Nakamura stated \"...the music styles of Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock and Jeff Beck.\" The 20 track CD was released by DigiCube on April 21, 1997 in Japan.\n\nAccording to Ken Kutaragi, when tested with a \"performance analyzer\" which Sony's engineers had developed to test how much of the PlayStation's potential a piece of software uses, \"Tobal 2\" was shown to use 90%, while every other PlayStation game released up until that point measured at 50% or less.\n\nDespite its exclusive release in Japan, the game has received relatively high praise among importers. GameSpot gave \"Tobal 2\" an 8.1/10, finding that it is superior to \"Tobal No. 1\" in every aspect and makes for \"a great diversion from the norm.\" However, the website admits that it has no chance of competing with more popular fighting series such as \"Tekken\" and \"Mortal Kombat\".\n\n\"Tobal 2\" sold over 318,000 copies in Japan in 1997, making it the 31st best selling game of the year. In 2000, \"Tobal 2\" was ranked number 50 on \"Weekly Famitsu\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 100 best PlayStation games of all time.\n\n"}

{"id": "2240872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2240872", "title": "A Best", "text": "A Best\n\nA Best (stylized as BEST) is the first greatest hits album by Japanese singer-songwriter Ayumi Hamasaki. It was released on March 28, 2001 by Avex Trax and Avex Music Creative Inc.. Hamasaki had originally planned to release a greatest hits album after her 2002 studio album \"I Am...\", but the idea was denied by Avex head staff. Instead, Avex released the album in 2001, which caused conflict between the label and Hamasaki. The compilation was released in two different formats including a physical and a digital release. Seven different artworks were released in several editions of the album. The album includes one new track, three re-recorded tracks, and the rest previously released singles.\n\n\"A Best\" was appreciated by contemporary critics who noted the quality and memorability of the tracks. Many also labelled the album as one of the best representations of Japanese pop music. Released purposely against fellow Japanese musician Hikaru Utada's studio album \"Distance\" for direct competition, the compilation entered at number two on Japan's Oricon Albums Chart. It reached number one the following week, and sold over five million units in Japan. The album's lead single \"M\" was released on December 3, 2000 and reached the top spot on the Oricon Singles Chart.\n\nIn support of Hamasaki's third studio album \"Duty\" and \"A Best\", Hamasaki held two concerts at Japan's Tokyo Dome. The tour was a commercial success, and one live recording was released. Since its release, the album brought Hamasaki a number of accolades and award nominations with a series of successful recognition throughout Eastern and Western publications. In 2016, Hamasaki re-released the album on that same date as a 15th anniversary celebration; this included new material and formats. Hamasaki will promote the re-release with a Japanese concert tour, entitled Made in Japan. As of 2012, \"A Best\" has sold over seven million units worldwide.\n\nHamasaki had revealed plans in wanting to release her first greatest hits after a \"couple more albums\" when she released her 2002 studio album \"I Am...\". However, in early 2001, Hamasaki's record label Avex Trax announced the plans for the release of a greatest hits package with an undisclosed date at the time. Avex had contacted Hamasaki one day, and stated that they intended to release the album on a specific date unbeknownst to her. Avex decided to purposely release the album against fellow Japanese recording artist Hikaru Utada's second studio album \"Distance\" on March 28, 2001 for direct competition of sales; Utada had previously sold over 10 million units for her debut album \"First Love\" (1999).\n\nHamasaki originally thought the statement was a \"joke\", but was against the overall idea. She felt that majority of her single material for the album was \"insufficient\" at the time. She said, \"It was too early for release. My 'best album' was something I dreamt of doing my way, but one day the company came to me and said 'your best album has to be released on this month and on this day.\" The date announcement was a widely controversial topic throughout Japanese and Western media, to which claimed the two singers as \"rivals\" on both personal and professional circumstances. Hamasaki denied the claims, but decided to take more control of her future material and asserted that she didn't want to be marketed as a \"product\" by Avex.\n\nDuring the album's production and mastering phase, Avex requested Hamasaki to hand-pick her favourite singles past-2001. Nearly every single from her three studio albums: \"A Song for ××\", \"Loveppears\" (1999), and \"Duty\" appeared on the compilation album. Knowing that the material was still insufficient, Hamasaki reluctantly re-recorded three tracks; \"Trust\", \"Depend on You\", and the non-album single \"A Song for...\". Hamasaki had to re-record the tracks whilst recording the material for \"I Am...\". The tracks \"Boys & Girls\" was re-composed by Japanese musician Dai Nagao, whilst retaining Hamasaki's original vocals. The track \"End Roll\" was re-recorded by Hamasaki, and re-composed by Nagao. Hamasaki selected the tracks \"M\" and the non-single \"Who...\" to be included on the album; \"Who...\" did not feature the hidden track \"Kanariya\", which appeared on \"Loveppears\". \"M\" appeared on the \"I Am...\" album, and whilst the studio album also spawned the singles \"Evolution\" and \"Never Ever\" before the compilation's release, they were not included.\n\n\"A Best\" was released on March 28, 2001 in two formats; a standard compact disc, and a digital download. Both the CD and digital download includes 16 tracks, with the physical editions housed in a cardboard sleeve. The cardboard sleeve of the album was photographed by Keita Haginiwa, whilst the booklet was designed by Shigeru Kasai from RICE. The black-and-white cover features a close-up shot of Hamasaki, with a tear falling down her face. The cover was reported by several publications at the time, many whom believed it was a visual response to the album's release and reports of her and Utada's rivalry. For each six albums released had six different artworks, each having different close-up poses by Hamasaki. \"A Best\" is Hamasaki's first album to embody her \"\" logo on the front of the cover.\n\n\"A Best\" received positive reviews from music critics. Mori Tomoyoki from Amazon Japan was positive in his review. Tomoyoki stated that, whilst her initial presentation as an artist was described as \"idle\", he labelled the album's material as \"excellent\". He also felt the lyrical content, whilst \"shocking\", represented Hamasaki well. Hiromi Yonemoto from Yeah!! J-Pop! was positive in his review. Yonemoto commended the album's quality, and commented that the album was the \"centerpiece\" of Hamasaki's sales success, concluding that the material is \"memorable.\" A staff reviewer for Tower Records commended the album's quality and felt that while the album featured more \"heart\" than her previous work. The reviewer called the album \"familiar\" and filled with \"Ayu charm.\" Alexey Eremenko from AllMusic selected many tracks from the album as the album and Hamasaki's best moments in her career. However, a staff reviewer from Yahoo! GeoCities awarded the album five stars out of ten, giving the album a mixed review. The reviewer personally commended the second half of Hamasaki's career on the disc, but felt the material was insufficient and that there was not enough to \"evaluate\" on. The reviewer selected \"Vogue\" and 'Who...\" as the album's best tracks, and felt they represented the Japanese pop music genre.\n\nBefore its release, Hamasaki commented that she was anxious at the album's first week sales. She commented that she felt it might \"be my last album... It's possible I'll may never get the chance again\". During a competitive week with Utada's album \"Distance\", \"A Best\" debuted at number two on Japan's Oricon Albums Chart. This resulted in \"Distance\" debuting atop the album chart, making it Hamasaki's second album after her 1999 remix album \"Ayu-mi-x\" not to enter the top spot. Hamasaki's album sold over 2.874 million units in its first week of sales, whilst Utada's album sold three million in its first week. This made \"A Best\" the second fastest selling album in Japanese music history, just behind \"Distance\" at first place. The following week, \"A Best\" replaced \"Distance\" at the top spot and sold over 510,000 units. This became Hamasaki's first greatest hits album to reach the top spot on that chart, and her fourth album overall.\n\nThe album stayed inside the top ten for nine weeks, the top 100 for 20 weeks, and eventually lasted 51 weeks in the top 300 chart. By the end of 2001, \"A Best\" placed second on the Annual Japanese Oricon Albums Chart with, behind \"Distance\". Hamasaki's album had sold over 4.24 million units in Japan, whilst Utada's album sold 4.40 million. Hamasaki's album sales reached an excessive ¥12 billion (approximately $106124280 US dollar) by the end of the year, which hugely effected the stock prices of the company. \"A Best\" was certified sixteen-times-platinum (adjusted to 4x Million by June 2006) by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) with physical shipments of four million units in Japan. Additionally, the album is the second best-selling album of the 2000s decade in Japan.\n\nThe promotion for \"A Best\" was extensive. Between March and April 2001, Hamasaki appeared in over 40 magazines within Japan. She travelled different areas in Japan to take part in the photo shoots, but was told several times to wait before commencing. Hamasaki appeared in several commercial advertisements, including the Takanoyuri Beauty Clinic print-only campaign \"Pink Pink Festival\". She also signed a deal with Japanese make-up company Kose Visee as their spokeswoman. Hamasaki became the spokeswoman for the KDDI Corporation subsidiary company Tu-Ka, which manufactured 2G PDC cellular operator's in three metropolitan areas (Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka). Hamasaki confirmed that she would perform two concerts in Tokyo, at their Tokyo Dome stadiums. During rehearsals of the tour, Hamasaki had to stop due to problems with her hearing in her left ear. Because of this, specific songs had to be cut from the concert tour because of its high frequency levels. Despite this, she did not postponed the rehearsals or concert dates due to tight scheduling. Hamasaki had been hospitalized a few times for consultations, but a doctor confirmed that continuing her to pursue music would result in permanent hearing loss. During some stage rehearsals at Tokyo Dome, Hamasaki became sick due to her hearing problems and could not finish the performances. Because of this, the rehearsals had to be hurried.\n\nOn July 6, 2001, the concerts first tour date, over 30,000 fans lined up for the show. However, tour organizers had asked them to wait longer due to Hamasaki's hospitalization. Hamasaki returned from the hospital, and was escorted to the stage with a wheelchair. Both concerts were commercial success, selling out on both tour dates, and made her one of few \"top-drawer\" Japanese artists to hold a concert at the Tokyo Dome. With sales from both the concert and album, Hamasaki was recognized as the top selling artist of 2001 with over 24 billion yen. In the aftermath of the tour, Hamasaki had become completely deaf in her left ear. She documented the condition, and publicly announced in January 2008 that she had been diagnosed with an inoprate ear condition (possibly tinnitus or Ménière's disease). Despite the setback, Hamasaki stated that she wished to continue singing, and that she would \"not give up\" on her fans and that \"as a professional\", she wanted to \"deliver the best performance for everyone\".\n\nA live DVD was released on December 12, 2001 through Avex Trax. A limited edition VHS and DVD was released with different artwork and packaging. Through an exclusive deal with Sony, they released a limited edition PlayStation 2 musical video game entitled \"Visual Mix: Ayumi Hamasaki Dome Tour 2001\" (2001). The video game is split into three sections; the visual mix (where the player uses the controller to change and direct the respective music videos and concert tour, alongside special effects editing), the Ayu-Mi-x studio (where the player can create and edit music through her songs \"Unite!\" and \"Endless Sorrow\"), and Ayu Browser (which is an online browser using customized Ayu settings).\n\n\"M\" was released as the album's lead single on December 8, 2000., and was later included on her \"I Am...\" album in 2002. \"M\" was Hamasaki's first single she composed herself after her production team failed to compose a track in her liking. Upon its release, it garnered positive reviews from music critics. Many critics commended the song's composition, lyrical content, and highlighted the track as one of Hamasaki's best singles in her career. \"M\" was successful in Japan, peaking at number one on the Japanese Oricon Singles Chart by selling over 500,000 units in its first week of sales. It became Hamasaki's seventh number one single on that chart. By the end of 2001, \"M\" sold over 1.32 million units and was certified million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for exceeding one million shipments in that region. The single charted at number 87 on the Japan Billboard Adult Alternative chart.<ref name=\"BillboardAD 2008/09/22\"></ref> The single was certified platinum by RIAJ for selling over 250,000 digital units in Japan, tallying the single's sales to 1.76 million units as of 2014. The accompanying music video for the single was shot in Tokyo by Wataru Takeishi; it features Hamasaki inside a church, with scenes of her wearing a wedding dress and singing with her backup band in the rain.\n\n\"M\" was re-released in Germany through Drizzly Records on November 3, 2003, with Hamasaki using her European stage name Ayu. The single was a triple re-release from the \"A Best\" and \"I Am...\" album, and the \"Ayu Trance\" compilation remix album, on a vinyl and CD Maxi single format. The re-released single was remixed by Above & Beyond, and was served as Ayu's second, first, and sixth international single in Germany, Spain, and North America. The accompanying music video for the remix single was shot in Tokyo by Masato Okazaki; it features several images and video shots of Hamasaki performance, whilst including different computer generated imagery.\n\nBy 2007, \"A Best\" sold over 4.3 million units in Japan, making it the sixth best selling album in that region. This makes Hamasaki the second female artist to claim the spot; the other two entries were both by Utada. By 2010, Avex confirmed that it had sold 4.5 million units. With additional sales from digital purchases, \"A Best\" has sold over five million units in Japan, making this Hamasaki's best selling effort as of today. Worldwide, the album has sold over seven million units and is Hamasaki's best selling global effort. Both Hamasaki and Utada's albums were the fastest selling albums of all time globally, having each sold nearly three million units. The record was broken in 2015 by British musician Adele's studio album \"25\", which sold over 3.4 million units in the United States and reached number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200. The album was recognized as the third best selling album through digital store in 2014, and was placed second the following year.\n\nThe album has been cited by several publications as one of Hamasaki's best work to date. Alexey Eremenko from AllMusic stated that, whilst the album was a success, he noted that \"A Best\" was the moment that there was the \"serious friction\" between Hamasaki and her label; this was one of the first publicized rifts between the parties in Japan music history. In honour of the album's release, Hamasaki continued embroiling her studio albums with her symbolic \"\" logo. It was issued on her compilation albums; \"A Ballads\" (2003), the \"A Best 2\" (2007) black and white editions, \"\" (2008), \"A Summer Best\" (2012) and \"M(A)DE IN JAPAN\" (2016) where it's put in brackets. \"A Best\" also brought Hamasaki a number of accolades and award nominations. At the Annual 2001 Japan Gold Disc Awards, Hamasaki won Single of the Year for \"M\" and Domestic Artist of the Year. The following year, she won Domestic Artist of the Year again and Pop Album of the Year for \"A Best\". At the 2001 World Music Awards, Hamasaki won the regional award for Best Japanese Act. At the 2002 MTV Asian Awards, Hamasaki won a special award entitled the Most Influential Asian Artist Award. At the first 2002 MTV Video Music Awards Japan, Hamasaki won the award for Best Female Artist, alongside nominations for Best Video of the Year and Best Pop Artist.\n\nIn retrospect of the album, Hamasaki had been interviewed in 2004 for the Nippon TV special documentary \"Light and Shadow: Despair and Decision at Age 25\". She commented that she had been recognized severely as a \"product\" rather than a real person, and that she was considered the most \"important product\" to Avex. Hamasaki denied claims of retirement from the music industry, but threatened her position within Avex by wanting to separate from them. She furthered explained her staying with the companying; \"I knew that if I didn't stay with the company, I'd never be able to come back to it. I'd live very thoroughly here, but I thought 'I just want to live like a human.' I was significant to them [Avex Trax], so I felt like 'lets fight the man' I guess. I wanted to resist the company even though I felt like I was part of it.\"\n\nOn January 28, 2016, Hamasaki announced via her official website the re-release of \"A Best\". Hamasaki confirmed that the album would be released on the same date as the original album, and will be entitled the 15th Anniversary Edition. The album will include the original 16 tracks, but have been remastered by American engineer and producer Stephen Marcussen. This is Marcussen's first collaboration with Hamasaki, and mastered the album at his own Marcussen Studio's in Hollywood, California. The original album cover is used on both the cardboard sleeve and jewel case. Initial promotion of the album offered T-shirt designs of the six alternative jewel case album covers, handwritten lyrics to the album lyrics, and a specialized anniversary book. On one of Hamasaki's posts on her website, several Japanese public figures such as ice skater Mao Asada, Japanese model and actress Riisa Naka, music writer Mihi Fujii, and sociologist Noritoshi Furuichi took appreciation and retrospect in the collection and commended Hamasaki's longevity in the music industry.\n\nThe album is released in four formats; a standard CD, a CD and DVD bundle, a CD and Blu-ray bundle, and a digital release. All physical editions include the remastered 16 tracks, whilst the digital download includes three bonus a cappella versions of \"A Song for...\", \"Trust\", and \"Depend on You\". The DVD and Blu-ray bundles are housed inside a special box packaging, and features the music videos to ten of the tracks. On its opening day release, \"A Best: 15th Anniversary Edition\" debuted at number nine on the Oricon Daily Albums Chart with just over 2,000 units sold. To promote the album, Hamasaki will be appeared on the Japanese music television show Music Station on March 25, 2016. Hamasaki hosted a special website, where her fans used their Twitter accounts to \"share\" memories about the album; all entries were placed on the album cover's collage.\n\nOn the same day of the album's announcement, Hamasaki announced an arena concert tour in Japan entitled Made in Japan. The concert tour is an expansion of her New Year's Eve Countdown live show with the same name, and will be in support of \"A Best: 15th Anniversary Edition\".\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of the CD.\n\n! scope=\"row\"| Japan (RIAJ)\n! scope=\"row\"| Worldwide\n! scope=\"row\"| Japan (RIAJ)\n\n\n"}

However, they are commonly used in games such as \"Half-Life\" or \"Call of Duty\" to bring in new enemies or challenges to the player in a seemingly surprising manner while they are still playing. They can also present further plot points without requiring the player to take a break by watching a cut scene. The intended results of this style of presentation is to increase immersion and to maintain a smoothly-flowing experience that keeps the player's interest.\n\nScripted sequences trigger off of a number of things. A timer, progress of the game, or a check point could activate a scripted sequence. For players that speedrun video games, skipping these scripted sequences that would otherwise slow down their completion time is a talent. Being able to manipulate the games hit boxes so that the game does not trigger sequence is efficient for fast completions.\n\n\"Half-Life\" uses scripted sequences throughout the game (aside from one short cut scene). Walking near other characters can trigger scripted sequence of dialog. These dialog sequences tell the games story in a different narrative and sometimes are simply there for entertainment purposes.\n\n\"Gears of War\" uses scripted sequences between sections of game play to provide objective reminders and tell the games story without the use of cut scenes. The game triggers a playable scripted sequence once all of the enemies have been cleared in an area, usually these sequences play while the player moves to the next area.\n\n\"Resident Evil 4\" has many examples of scripted sequences that utilize a quick time event to feature more action packed game play. As the player navigates the level, they must react to the event to continue.\n\nGames such as \"Call of Duty\" have been criticized for a reliance on these sequences, as many feel they tend to guide a player through a game by the invisible hand of the developers, blocking progression with invisible walls until the scripted sequence has triggered further progression. Also, the use of scripted sequences may diminish replay value as the surprise effect is negated upon subsequent play-throughs.\n"}
{"id": "2240875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2240875", "title": "The Hakkenden", "text": "The Hakkenden\n\n, also known as The Legend of the Dog Warriors: The Hakkenden, is an OVA series by AIC in two sequences, the second subtitled . The anime is based on the epic novel \"Nansō Satomi Hakkenden\" written by Kyokutei Bakin during the latter half of the Edo period. At 106 volumes, the novel bears the distinction of being the longest novel in classic Japanese literature.\n\n\"The Hakkenden\" is most known for its unique approach to animation, switching between several distinct visual styles throughout the duration of the series (sometimes even several times within the same episode). In addition, the series is also noted for its heavy use of symbolic imagery and themes, allowing the series to straddle the line between animation and art.\n\nIt is also known for introducing a modern perspective to a literary classic, since outdated, morally ambiguous concepts such as feudal loyalty and devotion are closely scrutinized and re-examined during many of the conflicts in the story. \"The\" at the front of the title is not a formality of translation, but a part of the title written in English, perhaps chosen by the series' writers to deliberately convey that sense of modernity.\n\nThe story takes place during the beginning of the Sengoku Jidai in Awa, a tiny province that is currently a part of modern-day Chiba Prefecture. Fuse, princess of the Awa-based Satomi clan, spiritually gives birth to eight warriors who are scattered across different areas of the region. Because the spiritual father of these warriors was a demonically-possessed dog, these warriors came to be known as the Hakkenshi (八犬士), with hak (八), or hachi, meaning \"eight\", the ken (犬) meaning \"dog\", and the shi (士) meaning \"warrior\". (The word \"den\" (伝) at the end of the title means \"legend\", so the title of the series can be translated as \"The Legend of the Eight Dogs\".)\n\nThroughout the series, each dog warrior recognizes the other through three distinguishing features: a family name starting with the word \"inu\" (meaning dog), a birthmark in the shape of a peony (the emblem of the Satomi clan) and a bead containing a kanji character that reflects eight of the fundamental virtues of Confucianism. They are:\n\nNote that this is the order in which the beads appear in the story. The hierarchy of these virtues in order of importance to Confucian philosophy are: jin, gi, rei, chi, chū, shin, kō, tei.\n\nPlotwise, the series can be divided into three parts: the Prologue, the Search, and the Resolution. The Prologue presents events that occur before the birth of the dog warriors and encompasses the majority of episode 1, although numerous Prologue events are also shown throughout the series in flashback. The Search consists of the episodes prior to the warriors' final assembly (episodes 2-11), and the Resolution shows the final climactic battle fought by the Hakkenshi in the name of the Satomi clan.\n\nThroughout the novel, the Hakkenshi undergo numerous changes in class, location, and status, which would often result in a name change. Because of the abridged nature of the OVA series, two characters in particular underwent name changes with little explanation for those unfamiliar with the novel.\n\nNote: each warrior's \"given name\" contains the kanji character on their corresponding bead. In Shino's case, for instance, the kanji for \"taka\" in \"Moritaka\" is also the \"kō\" on his bead.\n\n"}

Johnson was best known for his group The Brothers Johnson and his session playing on several hit albums of the 1970s and 1980s, including the best selling album of all time, \"Thriller\".\n\nHis signature sound came from the Music Man StingRay bass guitar, which Leo Fender made for him, and from his slapping technique. He is ranked number 38 on \"Bass Player\" magazine's list of \"The 100 Greatest Bass Players of All Time\".\n\nHis work appears on many well-known records by prominent artists. Johnson played on Michael Jackson's albums \"Off the Wall\", \"Thriller\" and \"Dangerous\", and hit songs \"Billie Jean\" and \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\". He also played on George Benson's \"Give Me the Night\". He was one of three bassists on Herb Alpert's 1979 album \"Rise\", which included its top-10, Grammy-winning disco/jazz title-track. Due to his distinctive style, Johnson was nicknamed \"Thunder-Thumbs\". His slap bass playing arrived soon after Larry Graham brought it into the mainstream, and both are considered the \"grandfathers\" of slap-bass playing.\n\nHis slap bass lines figure prominently in his work with Stanley Clarke on the \"Time Exposure\" album, his work with Grover Washington, Jr. (\"Hydra\"), George Duke (\"Guardian of the Light\", \"Thief in the Night\"), Jeffrey Osborne (\"Jeffrey Osborne\", and \"Stay with Me Tonight\"). The bass line for Michael McDonald's \"I Keep Forgettin' (Every Time You're Near)\" has been sampled as a backing track for dozens of rap songs. An excellent example of his thumb playing can be heard on the Earl Klugh song \"Kiko\". Without any plucking at all, Johnson sets a complicated funky bass line using a combination of counterpoint slapping with right hand using right thumb, counterpoint with left hand middle finger as a mute tec., called a slap choke, thus creating a percussive sound like drums, adding to the bass notes. His style incorporated more funk plucks in combination with his thumping, which along with the Music Man StingRay sound gives a very funky, unique sound. He was the bassist on Earl Klugh's 1976 jazz/pop album \"Living inside Your Love\" and 1977 jazz/pop album \"Finger Paintings\", as well as Quincy Jones' 1975 \"Mellow Madness\".\n\nJohnson also worked with Andrae Crouch, Angela Bofill, Anita Baker, Aretha Franklin, Billy Preston, Bill Withers, Björk, The Controllers, The Crusaders, Dave Grusin, David Diggs, Deniece Williams, Donna Summer, Donn Thomas, Gábor Szabó, Gene Van Buren, Harvey Mason, Herbie Hancock, Hiroshima, Irene Cara, The Jacksons, James Ingram, John Mellencamp, Karen Carpenter, Kent Jordan, Kenny Loggins, Lee Ritenour, Leon Haywood, Lesley Gore, Makoto Izumitani, Natalie Cole, Patti Austin, Paul McCartney, Peabo Bryson, Peggy Lee, Phil Collins, Pointer Sisters, Randy Badazz, Rene & Angela, The Ritz, Rufus, Sérgio Mendes, Side Effect, Sister Sledge, Stevie Nicks, Stevie Wonder, Sweet Comfort Band, Temptations, George Duke, and Toshiki Kadomatsu.\n\nLouis Johnson died on May 21, 2015 at the age of 60.

Originally scheduled to be held on 25 June, the 2004–05 NHL lockout led to the draft being postponed to 30 July.\n\nSpecial procedures were required to determine the order of picks, because the previous season had been cancelled due to the lockout. The first overall pick was won in a lottery by the Pittsburgh Penguins, who selected Sidney Crosby.\n\nThe draft was originally scheduled to be held on 25 June, hosted by the Ottawa Senators at the Corel Centre (their home rink). However, the 2004–05 NHL lockout was still ongoing, causing the draft to be postponed. The lockout ended on 22 July with the approval of a new NHL collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The CBA set the new date of the draft as 30 July. The Corel Centre was still available but cannot be used on such short notice. The draft was instead held at the Westin Hotel in Ottawa, Ontario. The Senators were compensated by hosting the 2008 draft instead.\n\nAs a result of the rearrangement, the draft was not open to the public, for the first time since 1980. Nor was it possible for large numbers of drafted players to attend: only the twenty highest prospects on the NHL Central Scouting rankings were present.\n\nThe order of draft picks was usually determined by team performance in the previous season, with teams picking in the same order in each round (modified by any trading of draft picks). However, the lockout had led to the complete cancellation of the 2004–05 NHL season, so there were no final positions to base the draft order on. The new CBA modified the draft procedures accordingly.\n\nThe order of picks in the first round was determined by a weighted lottery. In the second round this order was reversed, so the team with the 30th pick would also receive the 31st pick, whilst the team with first overall pick would not pick again until the 60th pick (last pick in the second round). The order would continue alternating in each subsequent round, producing a 'snaking' order. Teams were permitted to trade their draft picks as usual, which led to some modifications to the order.\n\nThe new CBA reduced the draft length to seven rounds, compared to the nine rounds used previously. As a result, 230 players were selected.\n\nThe lottery was held on 22 July, the same day that the new CBA was approved. The top-rated prospect in this draft was Sidney Crosby, and it was widely assumed that he would be the first overall pick by whichever team won the lottery, so it became known colloquially as the 'Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes'.\n\nTeams were weighted based on playoff appearances in the last three completed seasons (2001-02, 02-03 and 03-04), and first overall picks in the last four drafts (2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004). Three lottery balls each were assigned to teams which had not qualified for any of those playoffs and received no first overall picks in that period. Teams which had one playoff appearance or first overall pick in those years were given two lottery balls. All other teams received one lottery ball.\n\nThree balls\n\nTwo balls\n\nOne ball\n\nThis produced a total of 48 lottery balls. As a result, teams with three balls had a 6.3% chance of winning the lottery, two balls 4.2%, and one ball 2.1%. The Pittsburgh Penguins won the lottery and therefore the first overall pick. Further drawing of team names was used to determine the order of the remaining picks.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2240917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2240917", "title": "November 1989 tornado outbreak", "text": "November 1989 tornado outbreak\n\nThe November 1989 Tornado Outbreak was a destructive tornado outbreak on November 15 and 16, 1989 across a wide swath of the southern and eastern United States and into Canada. It produced at least 40 tornadoes and caused 30 deaths as a result of two deadly tornadoes. The most devastating was the Huntsville, Alabama F4 tornado, which killed 21 on the afternoon of November 15. Nine more fatalities were reported at a single elementary school by a downburst on November 16 in the Town of Newburgh, New York. This Outbreak produced the most tornadoes in a single day in New Jersey. Several other significant tornadoes were reported across 15 states.\n\nHistorically, tornadoes are relatively common in north Alabama, where Huntsville and Madison County are located. The region was affected by the April 3–4, 1974, Super Outbreak and records show that Madison County has had 25 tornadoes from 1950 through October 1989.\n\nThe Zone and Local Forecasts issued during the early morning, Tuesday, November 14, mentioned the possibility of severe thunderstorms on Wednesday. Subsequent forecasts and statements marked with increasing certainty the ominous nature of the events to come.\n\nThe National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC) issued a Public Severe Weather Outlook at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday and highlighted the unusually strong potential for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes over the Tennessee Valley. The Birmingham Forecast Office followed with a Special Weather Statement at 10:50 a.m. with the headline, \"MAJOR SEVERE WEATHER THREAT POISED FOR ALABAMA AND NORTHWEST FLORIDA!\".\n\nA Tornado Watch was in effect for Madison and adjacent counties from 12:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. Soon after the issuance of the watch, emergency management officials, storm spotters and the NWS staff at Huntsville placed into effect a coordinated plan of action in accordance with established procedures. Beginning at 12:45 p.m., WSO Huntsville issued warnings for the west part of its county warning area as an intense squall line moved into northwest Alabama. Storm spotters reported large hail and intense straight-line wind associated with this squall line.\n\nAt the time the tornado struck Huntsville, a Severe Thunderstorm Warning was in effect for Madison County. That warning, issued at 4:13 p.m., was changed to a Tornado Warning at 4:35 p.m. based on a report relayed through the amateur radio spotter network of a tornado touchdown in the city. Critical weather information was disseminated over the NOAA Weather Wire Service (NWWS) and NWR and by many media outlets in Huntsville and adjacent areas providing the public with frequent weather updates on radio and \"crawls\" and live \"cut-ins\" on television. Links with spotter groups and emergency management and law enforcement officials worked well.\n\nOn the afternoon of Wednesday, November 15, 1989, at 4:35 p.m., a tornado struck the southern portion of the city of Huntsville cutting a swath of destruction from southwest toward the northeast through a business section and a heavily populated residential area. Twenty-one people died as a result of the tornado and 463 were injured. Eighteen people died in the tornado, and two other people died in early December and one in January from injuries sustained in the tornado. Total damage estimates were placed around $100 million.\n\nThe tornado struck during the beginning of rush hour and touched down initially on Redstone Arsenal and then moved into a business area crossing two major north-south highways. Twelve of the 21 deaths (57 percent) occurred in automobiles, a striking similarity to the 1979 Wichita Falls, Texas, tornado. In the Huntsville tornado, most of those killed in cars were in the process of performing normal tasks as opposed to seeking automobiles for safety.\n\nAs the thunderstorm moved into the southwest corner of Madison County at 4:15 p.m., the staff on duty at the WSO at Huntsville International Airport observed a wall cloud and rain-free base with the thunderstorm. The wall cloud showed no signs of rotation and dissipated shortly after being spotted.\n\nShortly after this, between 4:20 and 4:30 p.m., meteorologists working for NASA on the Redstone Arsenal observed a wall cloud and rain-free base with the thunderstorm as it moved across the southern portion of the Arsenal. Around 4:25 p.m., they observed rotation in the wall cloud.\n\nAccording to information shared with the National Weather Service by Duane Stiegler with Dr. Ted Fujita's group from the University of Chicago, the initial point of damage occurred one mile south-southwest of Madkin Mountain on the Redstone Arsenal near the intersection of Fowler Road and Mills Road. Trees were downed and some roof gutters damaged. From eyewitness accounts of the wall cloud, circulating air may have reached the ground without a visible funnel.\n\nThe tornado continued on a northeast track passing northeast of Building 5250 on the Arsenal. Little damage was done to that building. The storm then moved into a sparsely developed area, but it did do about $1 million in damage to Huntsville's garbage-burning plant which was nearing the end of construction.\n\nAt this point, the tornado began to cross the old Huntsville Airport and a large portion of the adjacent municipal golf course. It was here that the tornado struck the Huntsville Police Academy which generated one of the first reports of the existence of the tornado. Two officers were injured at the Police Academy.\n\nFrom the golf course, the tornado entered a business-filled and heavily populated area of Huntsville. The tornado crossed Memorial Parkway (US 231 and State Highway 53), a major north-south traffic artery. The tornado destroyed a number of shopping complexes, office buildings, much of the Waterford Square apartment complex, and churches as it slowly crossed Airport Road. It crossed Whitesburg Drive, another relatively major north-south highway. Nineteen of the twenty-one fatalities occurred in the area between the intersection of Airport Road and Memorial Parkway and the intersection of Airport Road and Whitesburg Drive. Eleven of the deaths occurred in automobiles, four in apartments, and four in commercial buildings.\n\nFrom the intersection of Whitesburg Drive and Airport Road, the tornado moved up Garth Mountain, as it continued on a northeast course. This took the tornado into a heavily wooded section. As it crossed the top of Garth Mountain and moved down the east side, it struck Jones Valley Elementary School on Garth Road. Thirty-seven children, five teachers, and seven painters were in the school when the tornado struck. The children were part of an Extended Daycare Program conducted at the school. The lead teacher of the day-care program moved the children from the second floor of the school building into a small open area under the stairway on the first floor. This action, first suggested by the school principal as she left for the day, saved the lives of the children.\n\nOne woman was killed in an automobile driving along Garth Road on the way to the school.\n\nFrom the school, the tornado crossed Garth Road and moved across a portion of Jones Valley Subdivision, a development of well-constructed single family homes. The tornado severely damaged or destroyed a number of homes in the Jones Valley subdivision. It continued across Jones Valley moving up Huntsville Mountain. The area from Huntsville Mountain to the end of the tornado path is rural with only scattered structures. The tornado continued to destroy or severely damage whatever structures it encountered.\n\nThe tornado topped Huntsville Mountain and moved down the east side crossing US 431. It traveled through this valley in the vicinity of Dug Hill before moving up and over Chestnut Knob. From Chestnut Knob the tornado traversed the Flint River valley referred to as Salty Bottoms, crossing the Flint River and US 72 (Trail of Tears Corridor). It crossed US 72 one mile southeast of Brownsboro.\n\nThis storm continued on an east-northeast track over Reed Mountain and Jasper Point to a small lake at the headwaters of the Killingsworth Cove Branch, a small creek which feeds into the Flint River. The tornado path ended at the southeast tip of this small lake.\n\nThe total path length was 18.5 miles from the initial beginning on the Redstone Arsenal to its end at the headwaters of Killingsworth Cove Branch. The damage path was generally about one half mile wide; however, it reached nearly one mile in width in the Flint River/US 72 area. The tornado was rated F4 on the Fujita Tornado Scale.\n\nA summary of damage from reports gathered by the \"Huntsville Times\" included: \n\nThe East Coldenham Elementary School disaster, sometimes known simply as the Coldenham disaster, was a disaster that occurred on November 16, 1989 in Town of Newburgh, New York, at approx. 11:35 a.m., in which a tornado-strength wind blew down a free-standing cafeteria wall, killing nine students and injuring 18 others. Though the event was officially recorded as an F1 tornado, conclusive evidence from a survey by a team led by Ted Fujita and others indicates that it was a downburst instead.\n\nThe East Coldenham Elementary School disaster received a tremendous amount of national and international media coverage at the time of the tragedy because most major news media outlets were at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, just ten miles away, to cover the awarding of the Sylvanus Thayer Award to former President Ronald Reagan, and accordingly were on site within minutes.\n\n"}

She made two Pacific cruises, beginning July 10, 1945 to Manus Island, and the second starting August 30, 1945 to Guam, Saipan and Hawaii. The trip to Guam was to bring food to the island. On the way \"Lane Victory\" sailed through a typhoon and was tossed around for 14 days. On February 27, 1946 her second voyage ended. With the end of World War II, she started shipping aid. In March 1946 she started delivering goods to Europe under the Marshall Plan. With the end of the aid plan, on May 11, 1948 \"Lane Victory\" was laid up at Suisun Bay, California.\n\nIn 1950 \"Lane Victory\" was taken out of storage and by October 1950 was back in service. She was then deployed to evacuate Korean civilians and United Nations personnel at Wonsan, North Korea. During December 1950 she evacuated over 3,800 U.S. troops and 1,100 vehicles from Hungnam while under attack during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. \"Lane Victory\" offloaded troops, vehicles and cargo as the cruiser and destroyers laid down a covering fire. After unloading she evacuated 7,010 men, women and children, taking them south to safety. When the ship arrived 7,011 passengers disembarked, as a baby had been born during the voyage. On October 10, 1953 she was laid up in Suisun Bay, California storage. An annual Korean War tribute day is held aboard SS \"Lane Victory\" in honor of those saved.\n\nIn 1966 the ship was restored to duty again for the Vietnam War. She also saw duty during the conflict moving ammunition and supplies to and from the war zone in Vietnam. On April 29, 1970 \"Lane Victory\" was laid up again at Suisun Bay for storage in the National Defense Reserve Fleet.\n\nDuring her three-war career, she traveled through the Far East Pacific, made a few transatlantic crossings and one circumnavigation of the globe.\n\nBecause of the ship's excellent condition in storage at Suisun Bay, the Maritime Administration decided to set aside \"Lane Victory\" for preservation. President Ronald Reagan signed into law H.R. 2032 on October 18, 1988, which turned over the ship to the United States Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II. Joe Vernick, John Smith and a group of Merchant Marine veterans had worked for years for the ship to be released from the Reserve Fleet.\n\nVolunteers from the United States Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II worked for three years to restore the ship to working condition after she had sat, slowly decaying, in Suisun Bay for nearly two decades. Many upgrades were performed in order to bring \"Lane Victory\" up to Coast Guard standards. She was drydocked in 1992, and her hull was proved sound. On September 10, 1992 her sea trials started and proved her seaworthy.\n\nIn May 1994 \"Lane Victory\" sailed south along the Baja Peninsula with the intention of joining the Liberty ship on the 50th Anniversary of D-Day in France. On May 2, 1994 she passed the Sailing Vessel Blythe Spirit about 500 feet off the starboard side according to the day log of S/V Blythe Spirit. This encounter was just north of Cabo San Lucas. Before reaching the Panama Canal the \"Lane Victory\" had engine problems that prevented it from going across the Atlantic Ocean in time to arrive for the D-Day Anniversary. It was reported on the Maritime Mobile Service Net later in May that the Victory Ship had chosen to return after repairs were completed to a California port to await the return of the \"Jeremiah O'Brien\".\n\nIn June 1994 \"Lane Victory\" participated in a mock Normandy invasion in the Santa Barbara Channel in celebration of the 50th anniversary of D-Day. In September 1994 she escorted the Liberty ship from San Pedro to San Francisco in celebration of \"Jeremiah O'Brien\"s return from her voyage to Normandy.\n\nOn October 9, 2007 SS \"Lane Victory\" received a Special Heritage Award from the World Ship Trust in San Diego.\n\nShe serves as a training facility for the Los Angeles County Fire Department, Los Angeles City Fire Department, local law enforcement agencies, FBI, the U.S. Coast Guard and other United States Armed Forces.\n\nAfter her 1988 acquisition by the U.S. Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II, \"Lane Victory\" was towed to the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro on June 12, 1989. She was turned into a museum and work ship again. In 1990 \"Lane Victory\" was designated a National Historic Landmark. A volunteer crew maintain and operate the ship and her two onboard museums. On September 13, 2000 Congress passed Resolution 327, recognizing SS \"Lane Victory\" as a representative of the service and sacrifices of the U.S. Merchant Marine to the nation during times of conflict: \"Whereas vessels of the United States merchant marine fleet, such as the S.S. LANE VICTORY, provided critical logistical support to the Armed Forces by carrying equipment, supplies, and personnel necessary to maintain war efforts\"\n\nIn February 2012 she moved from Berth 94 in Los Angeles Harbor by the Vincent Thomas Bridge to Berth 46 in Los Angeles Harbor at the end of Harbor Boulevard-Miner Street, south of the bridge. She was reopened to the public on February 17, 2012. She was moved, again, to Berth 49 in early 2013 as Berth 46 is being turned into a future super cruise ship dock.\n\n\"Lane Victory\" has been used in many movies, TV shows and commercials because of her excellent working condition. The ship's wakes were used in the 1997 blockbuster movie \"Titanic\" for the titular ocean liner's wakes. She also served as the setting for the climax of the comedy film \"The Pest\" the same year.\nOther films in which the ship appeared are: \"Black Ops (Deadwater)\" (2008), \"Flags of Our Fathers\" (2006), \"GI Jane\" (1997), \"Pearl Harbor\" (2001), \"The Thin Red Line\" (1998) and \"U-571\" (2000). \"(note: this is a partial list)\"\n\nSome TV shows she was featured in are: \"Alias, Baywatch, California Gold, Mail Call\" (episode #70), \"MacGyver\", \"Murder She Wrote\", the National Geographic Channel, \"NCIS\", \"Port Chicago Mutiny\" (TV movie), \"Return of the Pirates\" (History Channel), \"Special Ops Mission\" and \"Unsolved Mysteries\". In the \"King of the Hill\" episode \"Returning Japanese: Part 2\" (2002), Cotton is sent back to the U.S. aboard \"Lane Victory\". \"(note: this is a partial list)\"\n\nIn 1999 the ship was used in a Ford Super Duty commercial and Disney's \"Golden Dreams\" commercial. \"(note: this is a partial list)\"\n\nThe engine housed in \"Lane Victory\"s forward hold exhibit space was used as the engine for the fictitious gunboat in \"The Sand Pebbles\" (1966).\n\n\"Lane Victory\" earned one ribbon for World War II service, two for Korean War service – United Nations Korea Medal & Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation – and one for Vietnam War service.\n\n"}
{"id": "2240940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2240940", "title": "Kaiso", "text": "Kaiso\n\nKaiso is a type of music popular in Trinidad and Tobago, and other countries, especially of the Caribbean, such as Grenada, Belize, Barbados, St. Lucia and Dominica, which originated in West Africa, and later evolved into calypso music.\n\nKaiso music has its origins in West Africa (particularly in present-day Nigeria) and in the Kingdom of Kongo and was brought over by the enslaved Africans, who (in the early history of the art form) used it to sing about their masters. The people would also gather in \"kaiso\" tents where a griot or lead singer would lead them in song. Many early kaisos were sung in French Creole by an individual called a chantwell. Kaiso songs are generally narrative in form and often have a cleverly concealed political subtext. Kaiso performers are known as kaisonians.\n\nIn Barbados, \"kaiso\" refers to a form of stage-presented calypso, such as at the crop over festival.\n\nThe term \"kaiso\" is said to derive from a Ibibio/Igbo/Efik word used as an exclamation, such as \"Bravo!\", \"Let us join\". It can also mean \"Let us be friends\" in Igbo Anambra dialect. Plus, in the Igbo language \"ka anyị sonye\" means \"Let's join\". The word is often used synonymously with calypso today, but often with the connotation that the former is more authentic, showing approval consistent with its original meaning. This word can also be found in an Igbo name. Kaisoluchukwu (Solu, Kaiso). Kaisoluchukwu means \"Let's respect/follow God\" in the Igbo language.\n\nThe Ibibio people/Igbo people and the origins of limbo and calypso. The enslaved Ibibios, Igbo and supposedly other slaves would gather, plant two poles on opposite ends, and place a bar across. They would take turns (individually) dancing and negotiating their bodies to go underneath the bar and exit on the opposite end without upsetting it, no matter how low the bar was. The accompanying chant used to egg on and lead the dancer to a successful exit went something like this: \"kaiso, kaiso, kaiso\" —– meaning \"go forward, go ahead, more\". The dance was later named limbo. Ka means go. Iso means forward. Kaiso therefore, means go forward in the Ibibio language of Southeastern Nigeria. The Ibibios and Igbo people who were kidnapped from the Niger Delta and Calabar, shipped across the vast Atlantic Ocean, and subsequently enslaved in the Caribbean islands of Trinidad and Tobago brought their music, language, and traditions with them. In slavery, their customs and traditions got interwoven into the larger slave culture of the area, but the word kaiso (go forward, go ahead, or more) survived. It later became the name of Trinidad and Tobago's most popular music. Kaiso evolved into calypso and that, too, evolved into soca music. The very fact that the word kaiso was common and accepted enough to be used for naming a dance or song suggests that the Ibibio and Igbo slave population of that area was strong and socially influential.\n\nCalypso music was developed in Trinidad in the 17th century from the West African Kaiso and canboulay music brought by captive Africans imported to that Caribbean island to work on sugar plantations. These slaves, brought to toil on sugar plantations, were stripped of all connections to their homeland and family and not allowed to talk to each other. They used calypso to mock the slave masters and to communicate with each other. Many early calypsos were sung in French Creole by an individual called a griot. \"Patois\" or Trinidadian French Creole was the original language of the calypso music.\n\nThat Kalinda and its accompanying drum rhythms were predominantly a Kongo input into Trinidad culture can be concluded from the significant number of Kongo names among remembered stickmen and popular stickyards and from the emotional involvement with stickfight culture of Kongo descendants interviewed in the 1970s in contrast with the attachment of Yoruba, Rada and Hausa descendants to religious ceremonies. The kalinda drum rhythm was transported almost bodily into Kaiso even without modification. This rhythm can also be heard in Calypso and Soca.\n\n"}

When Travancore and Cochin were combined into Travancore-Cochin, Kollam was one of the three revenue divisions. When the state of Kerala was formed in 1957, half portion of Chenkotta taluk was merged with the state of Madras. Later in 1957, the Cherthala, Ambalapuzha, Mavelikara, Karthikapalli, Chengannur and Thiruvalla taluks (formerly in Kollam district) were united to form the new district of Alappuzha.

{"id": "2240994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2240994", "title": "Mark V Special Operations Craft", "text": "Mark V Special Operations Craft\n\nThe Mark V SOC (Special Operations Craft) is a marine security, patrol, and special forces insertion boat used by the United States Navy and manufactured by VT Halter Marine Inc (Gulfport, Mississippi). It was introduced into service with the US Navy SEALs in 1995. \n\nThe development of the Mark V SOC was very fast-paced, taking only 18 months from the initiation of the program to actual delivery of the first boat on 4 September 1995. The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Contracting Directorate and a dedicated Program Management team executed this effort in record time, specifically because USSOCOM was given Agency level contracting authority. The contract was fulfilled when full operational capability was met in 1999. In all, 20 Mk V SOC units were delivered to USSOCOM at a unit cost of $3.7 million. The Mark V SOC deployment, on the other hand, was less smooth. Problems included instances of the windshield and entire pilothouse assembly collapsing upon wave impact. However, these issues have been resolved and the Mark V SOC has markedly improved maritime special operations capabilities.\n\nThe original Mk V SOC was designed to address the lack of any specifically conceived SEAL insertion craft. Prior to the Mk V SOC, SEALs traveled on any form of surface transport available, often resorting to taping lawn furniture to the deck of the available craft. The original Mk V competition included three different designs, one Kevlar composite monohull, one aluminum monohull and one aluminum catamaran hull; the aluminum monohull won. The Mk V SOC specifically incorporated a modular shock mitigation seating design to minimize injury. Experience gained during training and operational usage showed the aluminum monohull transmitted the impact with the water to the craft's occupants more readily than a composite hull. Even after modifications such as the addition of shock-absorbing seats, the boats are capable of generating up to 20 Gs of force while slamming across waves. This led to many cases of bruises, sprained ankles, chipped teeth, and back, neck and joint injuries. These injuries necessitated a replacement.\n\nOn 11 January 2008 the U.S. Navy unveiled an experimental version of the Mark V Special Operations Craft, designated the Mk V.1, designed to reduce the number of injuries sustained by sailors and SEALs during the operation of the aluminum version of the vessel. Nicknamed the MAKO, the vessel was developed by a subsidiary of Hodgdon Shipbuilding, in collaboration with the University of Maine's Advanced Engineered Wood Composites Center. It features a hull made of layers of carbon fiber, a foam core and an outer layer of Kevlar for additional strength. It was constructed and launched at the Hodgdon Yachts East Boothbay facility. The MAKO is lighter than the current Mk V. The Office of Naval Research funded the prototype “to compare the properties of composite construction with aluminum” versions of the same craft. \n\nThe primary mission of the Mark V is medium range insertion and extraction platform for Special Operations Forces (primarily SEAL combat swimmers) in a low to medium threat environment. The secondary mission is limited Coastal Patrol and Interdiction, specifically limited duration patrol and low to medium threat coastal interdiction. The typical Mark V SOC mission duration is 12 hours.\n\nFor example, in 2003, in one of the first actions of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Mark V SOCs operating out of Kuwait disembarked at least two platoons of Navy SEALs to capture Iraqi offshore oil terminals.\n\nThe Mark V has the capacity to carry sixteen fully equipped SEALs to missions away from where they are based. They ride on seats that are designed for maximum comfort and shock mitigation in high seas or heavy maneuvering, and allows occupants to either stand or sit. With a beam of 17½ feet, the craft has enough room to carry four Combat Rubber Raiding Crafts with six outboard motors (2 spares) and fuel, to deploy forces from a clandestine distance. The ramp on the stern allows SEAL teams to ride their CRRCs right up the stern of the boat, for fast extraction and insertion.\n\nTo support the SOF missions in a medium to low threat environment, the Mk Vs are outfitted with five gun mounts for small caliber weapons supporting any combination of: M-2 .50 cal heavy machine guns, M240 or the M60 7.62 mm machine guns or Mk19 40 mm automatic grenade launchers. Together these provide 360 degrees of firing coverage. To defend against aircraft, the craft has a station for firing the Stinger Man-portable Air Defense System (MANPADS). Later improvements include mounting stations for GAU-17 Miniguns, MK 95 Twin .50 cal machine gun, MK 38 chain gun and Mk48 25 mm guns. Personal small arms of the crew and passengers can also be used to defend the craft.\n\nThe Mark V has many special features, besides its weapons, that make it more survivable while delivering sailors to their missions. Its angular design and low silhouette reduces its radar signature making it harder to spot and detect. Its V-hull design gives it good handling qualities in rough water as well as speed and shallow draft (four feet when cruising on-step). Its twin MTU 12-cylinder TE94 Diesel engines give it power and reliability and, coupled with the two K50S water jets, provides fast acceleration for operations near shore or in shallow waters as well as cutting down on the rooster tail effect that can make fast boats easier to see and track.\nThe Mark V SOC will normally operate in a two craft detachment with a Mobile Support Team. The operational detachment, also referred to as the basic Mark V SOC operating system, consists of:\n\nA Mark V SOC detachment is deployable on two USAF C-5 Galaxy aircraft to a theater of operations within 48 hours of notification and is prepared to commence operations within 24 hours after arriving at a forward staging location. The detachment can also be delivered in-theater by well or flight deck equipped surface ships with appropriate crane and deck space capabilities, and, if appropriate, under their own power. A detachment is also transportable by road.\nThe Mark V SOC is operated by Naval Special Warfare Group THREE (formerly known as Special Boat Squadron ONE) and Naval Special Warfare Group FOUR (formerly known as Special Boat Squadron TWO) on the east and west coasts. Twelve Mark Vs are assigned to NSWG-3, Coronado, California, and eight to NSWG-4, Little Creek, Virginia.\n\nLocated at Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego, California is a new facility to house operational maintenance, training and administrative functions for 12 Mark V SOC. The North Island location was designed to allow rapid mobilization and transport of these vessel worldwide. The facility provides non-depot level maintenance of rolling stock and depot level maintenance of the Mark V SOC. In addition to maintenance and supply/spare parts warehousing facilities, on-site administration and training facilities with classrooms and briefing areas were provided. Final design includes a new 115' by 37' U-shaped, reinforced concrete pier, 60' long concrete floating docks to berth five vessels, and a gangway. The pier was designed to support the combined load of a 50-ton Mark V and a 70-ton marine travel lift used to lift the vessels out of the water and transport them to the maintenance facility.\n\nIn 2009, the Kuwait Naval Force signed a $61.6-million contract with United States Marine, Inc. of Gulfport, MS for the design and construction of ten Mark V patrol boats under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program for coastal interdiction, and special operations for delivery by June 2013.\n\nOn 9 July 2013, Congress was notified of a request from the Royal Saudi Naval Forces to purchase 30 Mark V patrol boats, along with associated equipment, parts, training, and logistical support for $1.2 billion. The boats' mission is to protect maritime infrastructure in Saudi littoral waters. They will be used primarily to patrol and interdict intruders in Saudi territorial seas, and recognized economic exclusion zones.\n\nFour boats were delivered to Greece via the Excess Defense Articles programme on April 6, 2020, and they are expected to be used by the Underwater Demolition Command of the Hellenic Navy. \n\n\n"}

He had a top ten U.S. hit in 1989 with the power ballad, \"Where Are You Now\".\n\nHarnen was born and raised in Plymouth, a small town in northeast Pennsylvania. In high school, he played drums in the marching band. In 1985, he became the drummer for the local band Synch, made up of lead vocalist Lou Butwin, guitarist Dave Abraham, bass guitarist James A. Donnelly and keyboard player Chuck Yarmey.\n\nThat year, the band recorded some of their songs, with Harnen singing on one song, \"Where Are You Now\". He had written the song with a friend named Rich Congdon, and the band decided to release it as a single on the independent label Micki Records, originally backed with the Butwin-sung B-side, \"End the Game\".\n\nAfter receiving local airplay in the Wilkes-Barre market, Synch was signed by Columbia Records and \"Where Are You Now\" was re-recorded at The Warehouse in Philadelphia with the former Dakota members Bill Kelly and Jerry Hludzik producing and Dave Abraham playing guitar. The band released the album \"...Get the Feelin\"' in 1986, and \"Where Are You Now\" reached #77 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, staying on the chart for two and half months. \"...Get the Feelin\" also included the local single, \"Give Love Another Try\", but it did not crack the charts. Synch was soon dropped by Columbia. They spent the next few years trying to recapture the spotlight, before disbanding, at which point Jimmy finally got his hair cut.\n\nIn the interim, one Richmond VA radio station (WLZR 92.9 FM) was still getting requests for the song, which was a consistent top performer during the nightly local request countdown after its 1986 release. WLZR-FM night DJ Kidd Crockett (later known as Kid Kelly of Z-100 New York and current DJ on Sirius XM 'Hits' channel) continued to play the song even after national airplay had dwindled. A part-time DJ at the station, JJ Wright, had always liked the song and kept a promo single of the record for his personal use. In 1988, Kidd Crockett and JJ Wright reunited in Buffalo NY at WKSE-FM. Shortly after, when another resurgent single, \"Into the Night\" by Benny Mardones became a national hit again, JJ dug up his promo 45 and presented it to Kiss 98.5 Program Director, Paul 'Boom Boom' Cannon, who in turn played it for his national music consultant who in turn submitted it to many of his Top 40 and Adult Contemporary radio stations where the domino effect caused a massive revival for the single. In 1989, \"Where Are You Now\" had now successfully resurfaced and began receiving a tremendous amount of airplay nationwide, with the song now credited as 'Jimmy Harnen with Synch'. WTG, a new label at the time, signed Harnen and while the song was climbing the charts he began recording a full-length release for the label. This time, the song peaked at #10 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and at #3 on the Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nHarnen's first album, \"Can't Fight the Midnight\", featured well-known studio musicians including future \"American Idol\" judge Randy Jackson (bass guitar), Toto's Steve Lukather (guitar) and a guest appearance by one of Harnen's idols, REO Speedwagon's Kevin Cronin and Synch/Dakota guitar player Jon Lorance. The album and tour flopped and Harnen spent the next couple of years releasing occasional songs and tapes until his move to Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nThere, he worked as the national promotional director for DreamWorks Records, and with management at Refugee Records. In early October 2006, Harnen rose from vice president of national promotion to senior vice president of promotion for Capitol Records.\n\nIn April 2009, Harnen left Capitol and joined Scott Borchetta, the founder of Big Machine Records (label for artists such as Taylor Swift), becoming president of the new label, Republic Nashville. Artists on the label include Florida Georgia Line, whose single \"Cruise\" was the most digitally downloaded single in the history of country music, Cassadee Pope, A Thousand Horses, Brett Young, and Ryan Follese.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2241015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241015", "title": "Michael Monroe", "text": "Michael Monroe\n\nMatti Antero Kristian Fagerholm (born 17 June 1962), better known by his stage name, Michael Monroe, is a Finnish rock musician and multi-instrumentalist who rose to fame as the vocalist for the glam punk band Hanoi Rocks, and has served as the frontman for all-star side projects, such as Demolition 23 and\nJerusalem Slim (with Steve Stevens).\n\nMichael Monroe was born Matti \"Makke\" Fagerholm on 17 June 1962. His father, Pentti Fagerholm (1935–2015), was a very well known Finnish radio personality and reporter. Monroe states in the Hanoi Rocks autobiography \"All Those Wasted Years\" that one of the first times he was exposed to rock n' roll was when he saw Black Sabbath's 1970 Paris performance on television. Some other favourite bands of Monroe's at the time included: Alice Cooper, The New York Dolls, Led Zeppelin, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Little Richard. From 1976 to 1979, Monroe played in a band called Madness. During this time, while rehearsing in a basement of a church in Töölö, Monroe met guitarist Andy McCoy (then known as Antti Hulkko); McCoy's band, Briard, was also rehearsing there at the time.\n\nLater, Monroe and McCoy played together for a short time in a band called Bolin. Monroe then went on to play saxophone in Maukka Perusjätkä's band, where he also met guitarist Nasty Suicide. Monroe auditioned as a bassist for Pelle Miljoona Oy but, even though the audition went well, they chose bassist Sami Yaffa.\n\nHanoi Rocks was a band that Monroe and his friend, guitarist Andy McCoy had thought of, but because McCoy was in the Finnish punk band Pelle Miljoona Oy, he told Monroe to start the band without him. From the very first Hanoi line-up only one member (besides Monroe) remained, rhythm guitarist Nasty Suicide, who would stay in the band until 1985. Andy McCoy left Pelle Miljoona Oy and joined Hanoi Rocks in 1980. McCoy also brought bassist Sam Yaffa with him. The band later recruited drummer Gyp Casino.\n\nThe band released their first album in 1981 titled \"Bangkok Shocks, Saigon Shakes, Hanoi Rocks\", with most of the songs written by McCoy. The album was produced by Andy McCoy and Michael Monroe, who were known as \"The Muddy Twins\". In 1982 Hanoi Rocks moved to London and released their second studio album \"Oriental Beat\", which the band later dismissed as a failure, stating that the album was mixed badly by the producer Pete Woolcroft.\n\nAfter the album's release, the band fired drummer Gyp Casino and hired Nicholas Dingley, better known as Razzle. This line-up, consisting of Michael Monroe, Andy McCoy, Nasty Suicide, Sam Yaffa and Razzle, has often been cited as the classic and definitive line-up. The band has said that Razzle revitalised them. Later that year, the band released \"Self Destruction Blues\", which had Razzle on the cover, but he didn't play on the album because it was actually a compilation of old singles. The tour for the album took the band to Asia for the first time.\n\nThe next year, 1983, the band released \"Back to Mystery City\". In 1984, the band got together with legendary producer Bob Ezrin and started work on their fifth studio album \"Two Steps from the Move\" which was their first recording deal to US markets. The original title of the album was \"Silver Missiles and Nightingales\", but this was changed before release. The album has been cited as one of the best glam rock albums, and Monroe has said that he \"is very proud of it.\"\n\nIn 1984, Michael Monroe and Hanoi Rocks were among the most popular performers in the UK. The readers of the Sounds magazine voted Hanoi Rocks as the second best band in the world just after Marillion. The Hanoi Rocks single release \"Underwater World\" and the album \"Two Steps from the Move\" were voted as the fifth best single and album of the year. The televised concert which Hanoi Rocks recorded in England was voted as the second best concert video, and as stage performers, the group was voted No. 3. Michael Monroe was voted as \"The Sex Symbol of the Year\". Kerrang! magazine readers voted Hanoi Rocks as the ninth most important newcomer, and their album was chosen as the tenth best album of the year. The readers of Kerrang! also voted Michael Monroe the seventh sexiest performer in the music business.\n\nWhile on their first large tour in the US, Monroe fractured his ankle, and some dates had to be pushed back. The band traveled to Los Angeles to spend some free time and to prepare for their two upcoming sold-out gigs. Some of the band members joined in with the members of Mötley Crüe to have a party at the home of Mötley Crüe singer Vince Neil while Monroe decided to stay in his hotel room and rest. During the party Razzle and Neil got into a car crash that resulted in Razzle losing his life.\n\nAfter Razzle's death, the band performed in Helsinki, Finland, in a concert which was partly televised all over Europe as part of the 'Europa Go Go' project. The show had over 500 million viewers across Europe and it was the first public concert with their new drummer, Terry Chimes. It was also the last performance of Hanoi Rocks with Sam Yaffa who left the band due to personal differences with McCoy. The band tried to record some demos with the new members, Rene Berg and Terry Chimes, but according to Michael Monroe, things \"didn't feel the same anymore\", and the band disbanded after a short tour of Poland. One of the shows in Poland was recorded and later became the \"Rock and Roll Divorce\" album, released after the band had already split up.\n\nAfter Hanoi Rocks broke up in 1985, Monroe decided to start his solo career, but first he got to work with his good friend Stiv Bators. In the Fall of 1985, Bators and Monroe were asked by Steven Van Zandt to record backing vocals in London and then fly to New York to appear on his song \"Sun City\" and its music video. Both agreed and recorded backing vocals for the song, and both can be seen in the music video.\n\nIn December 1985, Monroe announced that he would move to New York, and in 1986, Monroe founded his first solo band. In 1987, he released his first solo album, \"Nights Are So Long\". The album was a moderate hit, but it attracted big record labels: In 1988, Monroe signed to Mercury Records. In 1989, Monroe's second solo album was released, titled \"Not Fakin' It\". The album featured guest appearances by Monroe's friends and fellow musicians, including Steven Van Zandt, Ian Hunter and Nasty Suicide. The album reached number 161 on the US Billboard Charts, and was Monroe's first album to be distributed internationally. The album also got good reviews from critics, fans and fellow musicians alike. Music videos were shot for the singles \"Dead, Jail or Rock 'N' Roll\" and \"Man With No Eyes\". Axl Rose appeared in the music video for \"Dead, Jail or Rock 'N' Roll\". At that time, Michael Monroe hosted MTV's Headbangers Ball where he introduced the new music video to the world.\n\nWhen \"Not Fakin' It\" was released, the Guns N' Roses record label, UZI Suicide, was re-releasing Hanoi Rocks albums in America. Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash also made a guest appearance on Monroe's Los Angeles shows in December 1989, performing the song \"Looking at You\". Aerosmith's lead singer Steven Tyler had also taken notice of Monroe and asked him to perform with Aerosmith at Les Paul's 75th birthday at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York. Monroe played saxophone on the song \"Big Ten Inch Record.\" He mostly spent the rest of 1989 and 1990 touring.\n\nMonroe's solo career didn't prove to be as successful as he'd hoped, so in 1990 he decided to put together a new band. The band was called Jerusalem Slim, and was completed by former Billy Idol-guitarist Steve Stevens, Sami Yaffa, Greg Ellis and Ian McLagan.\n\nIn 1991, Monroe was asked by Guns N' Roses to appear on their \"Use Your Illusion I\" album, where he plays the harmonica and saxophone on the song \"Bad Obsession\". Monroe also later appeared on GNR's 1993 album, \"\"The Spaghetti Incident?\"\", where he sang on the cover of The Dead Boys' \"Ain't It Fun\". At the time, Monroe also joined Guns N' Roses on stage performing Honky Tonk Women together with the band members and Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones.\n\nJerusalem Slim released an album titled \"Jerusalem Slim\" but broke up in 1992, due to Monroe and Stevens' musical disagreements. Next, Monroe tried to form another band called Demolition 23. with Yaffa, Jimmy Clark and ex Star Star Guitarist Jay Hening, who was eventually replaced by Nasty Suicide. Demolition 23. did release an album, titled \"Demolition 23.\" and they toured successfully, for example, in Japan and Europe, but the band broke up after Suicide announced that he would be retiring from the music business.\n\nDuring the rest of the 1990s and the early 2000s, Monroe released four more solo albums before re-forming Hanoi Rocks with Andy McCoy.\n\nIn 2002, McCoy and Monroe started working together again and decided to reform Hanoi Rocks with two new members on guitar and bass, and with Michael Monroe's solo career drummer, Lacu. Hanoi Rocks released \"Twelve Shots on the Rocks\" in 2003. In 2005 Hanoi Rocks released \"Another Hostile Takeover\" replacing the two former members with Andy Christell on bass and Conny Bloom on guitar (both formerly of the Electric Boys). In 2007 the band released the album \"Street Poetry\". In 2008 Andy McCoy and Michael Monroe stated that they had taken the band as far as they could, and so they decided to end the band. In April 2009, Hanoi Rocks played 8 sold out farewell gigs in 6 days at the Tavastia Club, in Helsinki. The band's original guitarist Nasty Suicide appeared as a special guest on 3 of the last gigs.\n\nAri Väntänen's, Michael Monroe's and Andy McCoys's book \"All Those Wasted Years\" was published later in 2009 in Finland, telling the story of Hanoi Rocks from the beginning to the end.\n\nIn June 2009, Monroe performed in Helsinki and in Tampere, on Sauna Open Air -festival with Duff McKagans Loaded band. On 3 July 2009, Monroe also performed in Finland, at the Ruisrock -festival with Ginger's band, The Wildhearts. At the end of July, Monroe also shared the stage for the first time in many years with Sam Yaffa when his band, the New York Dolls, were performing in Helsinki. After these performances with Yaffa and Ginger, Monroe and Yaffa started discussing the possibility of working together again. In December 2009, Monroe met Ginger again while he was playing in Alice Cooper's band. Monroe joined Alice Cooper on stage at Cooper's concert in Espoo, Finland, to play \"School's Out\". After the show, Ginger and Monroe discussed the possibilities of working together, and soon afterwards, Monroe, Ginger and Yaffa decided to line up a band together.\n\nOn 25 January 2010 Michael Monroe held a press conference in Los Angeles, where he unveiled his new band featuring Sam Yaffa on bass, guitarist Ginger from The Wildhearts, Todd Youth from Danzig and Samhain on a second guitar, and Jimmy Clarke on drums. The press conference was hosted by Bam Margera of \"Jackass\". The Michael Monroe band started touring on 11 March at San Francisco's Paradise Lounge and toured the US until 21 March. After some of the first shows Todd Youth and Jimmy Clark were replaced by guitarist Steve Conte of New York Dolls and drummer Karl Rosqvist.\n\nDuring the summer of 2010 Michael Monroe band played a number of festival gigs all over the world, including Helsinki Live in Finland together with Guns N' Roses, the Sweden Rock Festival and the Download Festival in England. The band also performed at Ruisrock festival in Turku, Finland, where Slash was also performing. Monroe joined Slash on stage for a performance of \"We're All Gonna Die\" (from Slash's solo album) and \"Up Around the Bend.\" At the Ankkarock festival in Finland, Steve Conte couldn't perform and he was replaced for this one show with the ex-Hanoi Rocks guitarist, Nasty Suicide. Since the early 1990s and the Demolition 23 tour this was the first time of these three members of the original Hanoi Rocks to perform on the stage together. Michael Monroe also performed on Summer Sonic festivals in Tokyo and Osaka, where Slash was also performing. The two got together again sharing a stage for a couple of songs. During the performance of the song \"We're All Gonna Die\" Monroe broke two of his ribs while hitting a metal barrel in front of the stage.\n\nOn 28 June 2010, it was announced that the Michael Monroe band would be supporting Motörhead on their 35th anniversary UK tour.\n\nThe first album of Michael Monroe's new band, the live album was released in September 2010. The album was recorded at the Tavastia Club in Helsinki, Finland and mixed in Los Angeles by Niko Bolas whose credits include Neil Young, Frank Sinatra, Keith Richards, Kiss, Spinal Tap and more. The album was mastered by Grammy winner Richard Dodd, who had worked with Tom Petty and The Dixie Chicks.\n\nIn September 2010, the band went into a studio to record their first studio album, \"Sensory Overdrive\". The album was recorded in Los Angeles and it was produced by legendary producer Jack Douglas (Aerosmith, John Lennon). The first single, \"78\", was released in January and the album is set for release on 14 March 2011. The band has also booked an extensive UK tour for April 2010, taking in venues in London, Brighton, Birmingham, Leeds and Exeter among others. In September 2010, Monroe signed a recording deal with Spinefarm Records / Universal Music, to distribute Monroe's upcoming albums.\n\nOn 9 November 2011, \"Sensory Overdrive\" won the \"Album of the Year\" award at the 2011 Classic Rock magazine awards.\n\nIn the fall of 2012, Michael Monroe announced that the band would be back in the studio recording new album released in 2013. By July Steven Van Zandt played the well-received lead single, \"Ballad of the Lower East Side,\" on his radio show almost weekly. On 23 August 2013 the band released \"Horns & Halos\" which went straight to number 1 in the Finnish album charts and was certified Gold in four days in Finland.\n\nOn 6 March 2014, it was announced that guitarist Dregen was leaving the band to focus on his solo career. He would be replaced by former Black Halos, Amen and Ginger Wildheart guitarist Rich Jones\n\nUnlike other members of Hanoi Rocks in the 1980s, Monroe was never a big drug user or a big drinker although in the band's book \"All Those Wasted Years\", Monroe tells about being addicted for a short while to amphetamine and heroin in the 1980s while living in London, and to amphetamine between 2000 and 2002 after his first wife died.\n\nDuring his years in music business, Michael Monroe has established a close friendship with many music business icons including the late Stiv Bators and Johnny Thunders – both idols of Monroe's, Steven Van Zandt who produced Monroe's album with Demolition 23, Deborah Harry, Axl Rose, Slash, Duff McKagan and Alice Cooper.\n\nMichael Monroe and Hanoi Rocks have influenced many rock'n'roll artists and bands: Slash had bought tickets to the sold-out gigs in Los Angeles which were cancelled because of the death of Razzle. Vince Neil and Nikki Sixx of Mötley Crüe and bands like Guns N' Roses have said in public that they were all inspired by Hanoi Rocks. In the Hanoi Rocks autobiography \"All Those Wasted Years\", Foo Fighters guitarist Chris Shiflett says \"The Hollywood scene changed in just one night after people saw the pictures of Hanoi Rocks. After that everyone was wearing the same kind of hair, clothes and make up as Monroe.\" Michael Monroe and Hanoi Rocks have often been mentioned as the founding fathers of the Hollywood's glam-rock scene, which was then adopted and developed by many 1980s glam-, punk-, and hard rock bands like Mötley Crüe, Jetboy, LA Guns and Poison.\n\nMonroe met his first wife Jude Wilder in 1985 while she was working at CBS for Hanoi Rocks' \"Two Steps From The Move\" project. After they married in 1989, the couple moved to Los Angeles and then to New York. Later on the couple moved to Turku, a city in Finland, where Monroe relocated after many years in the United States. Wilder died of intracranial hemorrhage on 19 June 2001. Michael Monroe married his current wife, Johanna, on 3 July 2003.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is identified as a son of the king Ramadeva of Devagiri.\n\n\"Bimbakhyan\" (\"The story of Bimba\"), an old Marathi language poem, states that the king Bimbadev (or Bimbashah) came to Konkan from Anahilavada in 1294 CE (1216 Shaka). He was accompanied by a number of people, who had left the kingdoms of Anahilavada and Devagiri because of Muslim invasions. Bimba halted at Mahim, then an island, and became enamoured with its beautiful scenery. He built a palace on the island, and his followers also built their residence there.\n\nThis poetic account is not corroborated by any independent evidence, and is of little historic value.\n\nBased on the \"Bimbakhyan\" account, José Gerson da Cunha identified Bimba with Bhima II of the Chaulukya (Solanki) dynasty of Gujarat, whose capital was Anahilavada. In his \"Origin of Bombay\", Cunha wrote that Bhima had come to Mahim after fleeing his capital as a result of Mahmud Ghaznavid's invasion in 1024 CE. However, this identification is incorrect, as the Chaulukya king who reigned during Mahmud's invasion was Bhima I: he returned to his capital as soon as Mahmud left, and ruled there until 1064 CE. The Jain chroniclers of Gujarat recorded the achievements of the Chaulukya kings in detail, but they do not mention any conquest of Konkan by Bhima I.\n\nBhima II (r. c. 1177–1240 CE) could not have been Bimba either, as he was a very weak monarch. According to the Gujarat chroniclers, his kingdom ended up being divided among his ministers and regional chiefs. Such a weak ruler could not have invaded Konkan and subdued the more powerful Shilahara kings such as Keshideva II. Kumarapala was the only Chaulukya king who invaded Konkan. But he did not rule the area. Northern Konkan was ruled by the Shilahara kings around 1260 CE, and after that by the Yadavas of Devagiri.\n\nAccording to a 1495 CE Persian language \"firman\", 'Bimbashah' was a son of Ramadeva of Devagiri. After his father was defeated by Alauddin Khalji, Bimba fled to the Konkan coast. He was accompanied by \"rajguru\" (royal perceptor) Purushottam Pant Kavle and eleven \"umrao\"s (consorts). In Konkan, he took control of the coastal towns, such as Parnera, Sanjan, Shirgaon and others. He himself came to Mahi (Mahim).\n\nThis account is corroborated by another Persian record from 1436 CE, which states that in 1290 CE (1212 Shalivahana era), 'Raja Bimbashah' took possession of a coastal territory from Karson. This \"Karson\" can be identified with Krishna, who was the governor of Ramadeva in northern Konkan. A 1299 CE \"danapatra\" (donation record) also states that king 'Bimbadeva' granted some land in present-day Mumbai to his \"rajguru\" Purushottam Kavle.\n\nThese evidences prove that Bimba was Bhimadeva, the son of Ramadeva of Devagiri.\n\nBhimdeva built the Babulnath temple. The deity in this temple is named after the Babool trees which were the main components of a forest covering the low-lying areas of this island.

At age nine Rosa conceived and executed a scientific study of therapeutic touch which was published in the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" in 1998. She graduated from the University of Colorado at Denver in 2009 with a major in psychology. Her parents, Larry Sarner and Linda Rosa, are leaders of the advocacy group Advocates for Children in Therapy.\n\nIn 1996, Rosa saw a video of Therapeutic Touch (TT) practitioners claiming they could feel a \"Human Energy Field\" (HEF) emanating from a human body and could use their hands to manipulate the HEF in order to diagnose and treat disease. She heard Dolores Krieger, the co-inventor of Therapeutic Touch, claim that everyone had the ability to feel the HEF, and Rosa heard other nurses say the HEF felt to them \"warm as Jell-O\" and \"tactile as taffy.\" Rosa was impressed by how certain these nurses were about their abilities. She said, \"I wanted to see if they really could feel something.\"\n\nUsing a standard science fair display board, Rosa devised a single-blind protocol, later described by other scientists as \"simple and elegant\", for a study she conducted at age nine for her 4th grade science fair. There were two series of tests. In 1996, 15 practitioners were tested at their home or office on different days over a period of several months. In 1997, 13 practitioners, including 7 from the first series, were tested on a single day. The second series was observed and videotaped by the producers of Scientific American Frontiers. Stephen Barrett, MD, of Quackwatch was senior author, her mother (Linda Rosa, RN) was lead author, and her stepfather (Larry Sarner) served as statistician when the experiment was written up for the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\". The study, which included an extensive literature search, was published on April 1, 1998. George Lundberg, editor of \"JAMA\", aware of the uniqueness of the situation, said: \"Age doesn't matter. It's good science that matters, and this is good science\".\n\nThe study tested the ability of 21 TT practitioners to detect the HEF when they were not looking. Rosa asked each of the practitioners to sit at a table and extend their hands through a screen. On the other side of the screen, Rosa randomly selected which of the TT practitioners' hands she would hold her hand over. The TT practitioners were then asked which of their hands detected Rosa's HEF. Subjects were each given ten tries, but they correctly located Rosa's hand an average of only 4.4 times. Some subjects were asked before testing to examine Rosa's hands and select which of her hands they thought produced the strongest HEF. Rosa then used that hand during the experiment, but those subjects performed no better. The results showed that TT practitioners could not detect the hand more often than chance, and Rosa and her co-authors therefore concluded that there was no empirical basis to the HEF and by extension therapeutic touch:\nPublication of Rosa's experiment in \"JAMA\" was an international media sensation. In an article in \"The New York Times\", Rosa was likened to the child in the short tale \"\"The Emperor's New Clothes\"\". The article noted that Rosa's parents and helpers on the project were Linda Rosa, a registered nurse who had been campaigning against TT for nearly a decade, and Larry Sarner, chairman of the National Therapeutic Touch Study Group, an anti-TT organization.\n\nDavid J Hufford felt the study presented ethical problems because the authors of the study enlisted the cooperation of the TT operators by presenting the study as just a \"fourth grade science fair project.\" Hufford felt that this was failure of full disclosure and deceit. But Hufford's analysis did not acknowledge that the first round of tests \"was\", in fact, only a fourth grade science fair project done with no thought of future publication. Publication was suggested by Dr. Stephen Barrett months afterward when he learned that the study had taken place. The second round of tests was done at the request of Scientific American Frontiers, with the participants fully aware that they were being videotaped. No subsequent experiment has been undertaken overturning her findings. However, one published study clarified some of the issues that were raised at the time in parts of the skeptical community about the method and analysis of the data. Specifically, that study found that people should be expected to detect the presence of a hand at better than chance levels, most likely due to radiant heat because interposing heat blocking materials reduced accuracy to chance levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He won great distinction at the battle of Hohenfriedberg as a major-general, and was promoted lieutenant-general in 1750.\n\nBevern was one of the most experienced and exact soldiers in the army of Frederick the Great. He commanded a wing in the battle of Lobositz in 1756, and defeated the Austrians under Marshal Königsegg in a well-fought battle at Reichenberg on 21 April 1757. He took part in the battles of Prague and Kolin and the retreat to Görlitz, and subsequently commanded the Prussians left behind by Frederick in the autumn of 1757 when he marched against the French.\n\nBevern conducted a defensive campaign against overwhelming numbers with great skill, but he soon lost the valuable assistance of General Winterfeldt, who was killed in a skirmish at Moys; and he was eventually brought to battle and suffered a heavy defeat at the battle of Breslau on 22 November. He fell into the hands of the Austrians on the following morning, and remained prisoner for a year. He was made general of infantry in 1759, and on 11 August 1762 inflicted a severe defeat at Reichenbach on an Austrian army endeavouring to relieve Schweidnitz.

He is considered to be one of the most iconic writers of modern Bengali literature and also one of the most prominent writers in the Post-Tagore era. His best known work is the autobiographical novel, \"Pather Panchali\" (\"The Song of the Road\"). He was posthumously awarded the Rabindra Puraskar in 1951, the most prestigious literary award in West Bengal, for his novel \"Ichhamati\".\n\nThe Bandyopadhyay family originated in the Panitar village near Basirhat, located in the North 24 Parganas district of modern-day West Bengal. Bandyopadhyay's great-grandfather, who was an Ayurvedic physician, eventually settled in Barakpur village, near Gopalnagar, Banagram (now Bangaon), North 24 Parganas. However, Bandyopadhyay was born in Muratipur village, near Kalyani in Nadia, at his maternal uncle's house. His father, Mahananda Bandyopadhyay, was a Sanskrit scholar and story-teller by profession. Bandyopadhyay was the eldest of the five children of Mahananda and his wife Mrinalini. His childhood home was at Barakpur village (now Barakpur, West Bengal), near Gopalnagar.\n\nBandyopadhyay studied at Bongaon High School, one of the oldest institutions in British India, and was considered as a talented student. Following a first division placement in the Entrance and Intermediate Arts examinations, Bandyopadhyay completed his undergraduate degree in economics, history, and sanskrit at the Surendranath College (then Ripon College) in Kolkata. He was admitted to the master's degree (MA) and Law classes, but could not afford to enroll for the postgraduate course at the University of Calcutta, and joined as a teacher in a school in Jangipara, Hooghly.\n\nBandyopadhyay worked in a variety of jobs to support both himself and his family before becoming a writer. His first job was as a teacher, but he also served as a travelling publicist for Goraksini Sabha, and later as a secretary for Khelatchandra Ghosh, a role that included the management of his Bhagalpur estate. He became involved with Khelatchandra, a prominent name in music and charity, while tutoring his family. He also taught at the Khelatchandra Memorial School. Eventually, Bandyopadhyay returned to his native place. He started working as a teacher in the Gopalnagar School, which he continued alongside his literary work, until his death. He wrote and published \"Pather Panchali w\"hile staying at Ghatshila, a town in Jharkhand.\n\nBandyopadhyay's works are largely set in rural Bengal, with characters from that area. Several of his novels are set in Bongaon, including \"Pather Panchali\", \"Adarsha Hindu Hotel\", \"Ichamati,\" and \"Bipiner Sansar\". In 1921, Bandyopadhyay's first published short story, \"Upekshita\" appeared in \"Prabasi\", at the time one of Bengal's leading literary magazines. However, he did not receive any critical attention until 1928, when his first novel \"Pather Panchali\" (also known in English as \"Song of the Little Road\") was published (initially as a serial, then as a book in 1929). \"Pather Panchali\" brought Bandyopadhyay to prominence in Bengali literature, and the novel and its sequel \"Aparajito\", were subsequently translated into numerous languages. Additionally, these two were made into films by Satyajit Ray, and together with \"Apur Sansar\", formed the highly successful \"Apu Trilogy\". Ray referred aspiring scriptwriters to the works of Bandyopadhyay, and praised him by saying, \"His lines fit the characters so well, they are so revealing that even when the author provides no physical description, every character seems to present itself before us simply through the words it speaks\". His creation Taranath Tantrik was popular for the Bengali reader and the series was extended by his son Taradas.\n\n\"Ichhamati\" reflects and documents a period of caste stratified culture, the life of rural society along the banks of the Ichamati River, in undivided Bengal. The novel captures indigo planters, plantation life, and caste society in Bengal during the early 20th century, in vivid detail. Relationships are sensitively portrayed in the narrative, with the author exploring the subtle nuances contained therein. Readers have praised the detailed descriptions of nature and the unselfconscious, but poetic portrayal of the flora and fauna on the banks of the Ichamati River. \"Ichamati\" has also been described as a deeply spiritual piece of writing, with Advaita Vedanta holding particular relevance to the contained dialogue.\n\nBandyopadhyay wrote 16 novels, and over two hundred short stories. His style as a Bengali novelist has often been compared to Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay. \"Pather Panchali\" is considered Bandyopadhyay's masterpiece, and is included in the ICSE syllabus for students choosing to study Bengali. Author Humayun Azad opined, that the novel form of \"Pather Panchali\" is superior to its cinematic rendition. Azad's view is not necessarily a commonly held one in the West, as the \"Apu Trilogy\" is considered among the finest films in the history of cinema. The unavailability of a complete English translation of the novel creates difficulty in comparing the two separate works for the English-speaking audience (the available translation by T. W. Clark and Tarapada Mukherji is a truncated version). However, in the Bengali-speaking world, the stature of the novel is uncontested.\n\nAmit Chaudhuri has translated a few excerpts from the novel for inclusion in the anthology, \"The Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature\". In his introduction to these excerpts, Chaudhuri wrote, \"Unique for its tenderness and poetry ... \"Pather Panchali\" rejects both nineteenth-century realism and social realism (the social milieu described in it would have logically lent itself to the latter) for an inquiry into perception and memory.\" The complete text of \"Aparajito\" has been translated into English by Gopa Majumdar. The novel \"Aranyak\" has been translated into English in January 2017 by Suchismita Banerjee Rai, and it has been published by Mitra and Ghosh Publishers based in Kolkata.\n\nMartin Seymour-Smith, in his \"Guide to Modern World Literature\" (1973), describes Bandyopadhyay (he uses the form Banerji) as \"perhaps the best of all modern Indian novelists\", going on to write that, \"probably nothing in twentieth-century Indian literature, in prose or poetry, comes to the level of \"Pather Panchali\"\".\n\nBandyopadhyay spent his early days in abject poverty, and subsequently he supported his family financially, though the extent of his support is unknown. He had a stout build and walked miles in the woods every day, usually taking his notebook for the purpose of writing whilst surrounded by the wilderness.\n\nHis first wife Gouri Devi died of cholera, a year after their marriage. Her death and Bandopadhyay's consequent loneliness led to a theme of tragedy that became a recurrent motif in his early writings. At the age of 46, he married Rama Chattopadhyay. Their son, Taradas, was born in 1947.\n\nBandopadhyay died on 1 November 1950, in Ghatshila. The cause of death was identified as a heart attack.\n\nComplete list of novels:\n\nPartial list of short story collections:\n\n\n"}

He formed the band as a trio, but soon brought in British expatriate singer/songwriter Jim Pembroke (also in Blues Section) and organist Jukka Gustavson. A year later, Pekka Pohjola joined on bass. Kim Fowley produced Wigwam's second album \"Tombstone Valentine\" (1970). This album also featured an excerpt of Erkki Kurenniemi's electronic composition 'Dance of the Anthropoids'. The 1974 album \"Being\" is often called Wigwam's masterpiece. After its release, though, Pohjola and Gustavson quit the band. Commercially the most successful Wigwam album must be the more pop-oriented \"Nuclear Nightclub\" that followed in 1975, with new members Pekka Rechardt on guitar and Måns Groundstroem on bass. The album was recorded in Stockholm with better studios, and featured Esa Kotilainen, the Finnish equivalent of Rick Wakeman, on synthesizer. The effect of the synthesizer was to steer the group away from the organ and piano sound of Gustavson that dominated previous albums. The band from Nuclear Nightclub on had songwriters Pembroke and Rechardt often working together, and the two came to describe the style as \"deep pop\" instead of progressive rock.\n\nFor a time in the 1970s Wigwam seemed poised to break through in Europe, along with bands like Tasavallan Presidentti, but even though they were highly praised by the UK press large-scale international fame eluded them, and by 1978 they had disbanded. Jim Pembroke and Ronnie Österberg formed the Jim Pembroke Band in late 1979, but following health problems with diabetes, Österberg committed suicide on December 6, 1980.\n\nWigwam reformed in the 1990s with the Pembroke-Rechardt-Groundstroem core intact, and has been active to the present. In Finland they have a lasting (although limited) following, and their influence on Finnish rock music is widely recognised.\n\nIn 2010s the former members of Wigwam have made concerts billed as \"Wigwam Unplugged\" or \"Wigwam Revisited\". The latest line-up consists Mikko Rintanen, Jan Noponen, Måns Groundstroem and Jukka Gustavson with Pekka Nylund playing guitar.\n\nIn autumn 2018 the band will make a short 50th anniversary tour in Finland with line-up of Jukka Gustavson, Jim Pembroke, Pekka Rechardt, Esa Kotilainen and Jan Noponen with Pave Maijanen on bass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are Jim Pembroke's solo albums, which are played by Wigwam\n\n"}

The Franco-Prussian War indemnity enabled him to redeem a considerable portion of the state debt and to remit certain taxes.

The US edition retailed at $2.00 and the UK edition at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6).\n\nThe book features Hercule Poirot, supported by his friend Mr Satterthwaite, and is the one book in which Satterthwaite collaborates with Poirot. Satterthwaite previously appeared in the stories featuring Harley Quin, in particular those collected in \"The Mysterious Mr Quin\" (1930). The novel was adapted for television twice, first in 1986 as \"Murder in Three Acts\", and again in 2010 as \"Three Act Tragedy\".\n\nSir Charles Cartwright hosts a dinner party at his home in Cornwall. His guests include: Hercule Poirot; Dr Bartholomew Strange; Lady Mary Lytton Gore, and her daughter Hermione; Captain Dacres and his wife Cynthia; Muriel Wills; Oliver Manders; Mr Satterthwaite; and Reverend Babbington and his wife. When Babbington suddenly dies after sipping one of the cocktails being served, Cartwright believes it was murder. An investigation finds no poison in his glass. After his funeral, Poirot travels to Monte Carlo, where he is met with news from Satterthwaite and Cartwright that Dr Strange is dead. While holding a dinner party at his home in Yorkshire, Strange suddenly died after drinking a glass of port wine. The coroner rules he was poisoned with nicotine, despite there being no trace of it in his glass. With the exception of the three men, Strange's guests are the same ones who attended Cartwright's party. Due to the similarities, Babbington's body is exhumed, whereupon police find he died from the same cause. \n\nBoth Satterthwaite and Cartwright return to England to investigate the murders. They learn that prior to the party, Strange had sent his usual butler away for two months. A temporary replacement he hired named Ellis has since disappeared. Satterthwaite and Cartwright later find evidence showing that Ellis hoped to blackmail someone, while a serving maid recalls that Ellis acted strangely for a butler. When Wills is interviewed, she recalls noticing something odd at the party, and that Ellis has a birthmark on one hand. Some time later, Wills disappears. When Poirot returns to London to offer counsel on the case, he receives a telegram from Mrs De Rushbridger, a female patient at Strange's sanatorium in Yorkshire, who arrived on the day Strange died. Poirot and Satterthwaite go to meet her, only to find that she had been murdered with nicotine before their arrival. The poison had been concealed in some chocolates she had received anonymously. Learning that Cartwright's servant, Miss Milray, is hastily heading to Cornwall, Poirot follows her to find out why.\n\nUpon his return, Poirot assembles everyone, and denounces Sir Charles Cartwright as the killer. Cartwright wants to marry Hermione, but already has a wife who resides in a lunatic asylum. As he cannot divorce her under British law, he decided to conceal this knowledge by murdering Dr Strange, the only witness to this marriage. After his party, Cartwright convinced Strange to let him assume the role of his butler, and then secretly poisoned him during his party. He left false evidence to suggest the motive was blackmail, and travelled to Monte Carlo the day after to establish his alibi. The first murder was a dress rehearsal for the second: Cartwright wished to test if he could switch the glass containing the poison. The murder of Mrs De Rushbridger was purely to create a false lead.\n\nPoirot reveals that the nicotine poison came from distilling equipment Cartwright hid near his Cornwall residence; it was found by him, when Miss Milray went to destroy it. His suspicions about Cartwright were based on a few facts. Strange didn't drink the poisoned cocktail because he disliked cocktails, while Cartwright ensured Hermione didn't drink it; he didn't care who else amongst his guests drank it. Mrs De Rushbridger's telegram to Poirot was sent by Cartwright himself. Milray knows he is the murderer; her actions showed she sought to protect him. Wills also suspected him when she spoke up about Ellis; Poirot hid her away before Cartwright could murder her. Cartwright flees, but Poirot doesn't expect him to get far. Hermione is paired up with Manders. In the aftermath of the investigation, Satterthwaite remarks how he could have drunk the poisoned cocktail, to which Poirot remarks there was an even more terrible possibility: \"It might have been me\".\n\n\nThe \"Times Literary Supplement\" of 31 January 1935 admitted that \"Very few readers will guess the murderer before Hercule Poirot reveals the secret\", but complained that the motive of the murderer \"injures an otherwise very good story\".\n\nIsaac Anderson in \"The New York Times Book Review\" of 7 October 1934, said that the motive was \"most unusual, if not positively unique in the annals of crime. Since this is an Agatha Christie novel featuring Hercule Poirot as its leading character, it is quite unnecessary to say that it makes uncommonly good reading\".\n\nIn \"The Observer\"'s issue of 6 January 1935, \"Torquemada\" (Edward Powys Mathers) said, \"Her gift is pure genius, of leading the reader by the nose in a zigzag course up the garden and dropping the lead just when she wishes him to scamper to the kill. \"Three Act Tragedy\" is not among this author's best detective stories; but to say that it heads her second best is praise enough. The technique of misleadership is, as usual, superb; but, when all comes out, some of the minor threads of motive do not quite convince. Mrs Christie has, quite apart from her special gift, steadily improved and matured as a writer, from the-strange-affair-of-style to this charming and sophisticated piece of prose\".\n\nMilward Kennedy in \"The Guardian\" (29 January 1935) opened his review with, \"The year has opened most satisfactorily. Mrs Christie's \"Three Act Tragedy\" is up to her best level\"; he summarised the set-up of the plot but then added, \"A weak (but perhaps inevitable point) is the disappearance of a butler; the reader, that is to say, is given rather too broad a hint. But the mechanics of the story are ingenious and plausible, the characters (as always with Mrs Christie) are life-like and lively. Poirot does not take the stage very often, but when he does he is in great form.\"\n\nRobert Barnard commented much later that the \"[s]trategy of deception here is one that by this date ought to have been familiar to Christie's readers. This is perhaps not one of the best examples of the trick, because few of the characters other than the murderer are well individualised. The social mix here is more artistic and sophisticated than is usual in Christie.\"\n\n\n\n\nTwo recent audiobook versions have been released.\n\nThe novel's true first publication was the serialisation in the \"Saturday Evening Post\" in six instalments from 9 June (Volume 206, Number 50) to 14 July 1934 (Volume 207, Number 2) under the title \"Murder in Three Acts\", with illustrations by John La Gatta. This novel is one of two to differ significantly in American editions (the other being \"The Moving Finger\"), both hardcover and paperback. The American edition of \"Three Act Tragedy\" changes the motive of the killer, but not so significantly as to require adjustment in other chapters of the novel. It is helpful to keep this difference in mind when reading the reviews quoted in the section Literary significance and reception.\n\nA 1986 television film was made under the title \"Murder in Three Acts\", starring Peter Ustinov and Tony Curtis, which relocated the action to Acapulco, replaced the character of Satterthwaite by Hastings, made Charles Cartwright an American movie star. However, the killer's motive remained intact.\n\nAn adaptation starring David Suchet for \"Agatha Christie's Poirot\" was released as the first episode of Season 12 in 2010, with Martin Shaw as Sir Charles Cartwright, Art Malik as Sir Bartholomew Strange, Kimberley Nixon as Egg Lytton Gore, and Tom Wisdom as Oliver Manders. Ashley Pearce, who previously directed \"Appointment with Death\" and \"Mrs McGinty's Dead\" for the ITV series, also directed this. The adaptation omitted the character of Satterthwaite and changes a number of details but is generally faithful to the plot of the novel.\n\nA radio production was made for the BBC in 2002, starring John Moffatt as Poirot, Michael Cochrane as Sir Charles, George Cole as Satterthwaite, Beth Chalmers as Hermione Lytton Gore (Egg), the heroine, and Clive Merrison as Sir Bartholomew.\n\nThe production was broadcast across five weekly episodes on BBC Radio 4 and stays predominantly faithful to the novel, with only very subtle changes being made. Sir Charles travels to the South of France in order to get away from Egg, after initially believing she was in love with Oliver Manders, following a goodnight kiss between the two characters. At the end of the story, once Poirot has revealed the motive and the proof of the first wife, Sir Charles storms out of the room, in order to \"choose his exit\". It is implied he chooses the quicker option of suicide. A shaken and emotional Egg is then taken home by Manders, leaving Poirot and Satterthwaite to contemplate that they could have been the victims to the poison cocktail, at Sir Charles' party.\n\n"}

{"id": "2241109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241109", "title": "Alfred Nicolas Rambaud", "text": "Alfred Nicolas Rambaud\n\nAlfred Nicolas Rambaud (2 July 1842 – 10 November 1905) was a French historian.\n\nAlfred Nicolas Rambaud was born in Besançon. After studying at the École Normale Supérieure, he completed his studies in Germany. He was one of that band of young scholars, among whom were also Ernest Lavisse, Gabriel Monod and Gaston Paris, whose enthusiasm was aroused by the principles and organization of scientific study as applied beyond the Rhine, and who were ready to devote themselves to their cherished plan of remodelling higher education in France. He was appointed \"répétiteur\" at the École des Hautes Études on its foundation in 1868.\n\nHis researches were at that time directed towards the Byzantine period of the Middle Ages, and to this period were devoted the two theses which he composed for his doctorate in letters, \"De byzantino hippodromo et circensibus factionibus\" (revised in French for the \"Revue des deux mondes\", under the title of \"Le monde byzantin; le sport et l'hippodrome\", 1871), and \"L'Empire grec au Xe siècle, Constantin Porphyrognete\" (1870).\n\nThis latter work is still accepted as a good authority, and caused Rambaud to be hailed as a master on the Byzantine period; but with the exception of one article on Digenis Acritas, in the \"Revue des deux mondes\" (1875), and one other on Michael Psellus, in the \"Revue Historique\" (vol. iii., 1876), Rambaud's researches were diverted towards other parts of the East: The Franco-Prussian War inspired him with the idea for some courses of lectures which developed into books: \"La domination française en Allemagne\"; \"les Français sur le Rhin\", 1792–1804 (1873) and \"L'Allemagne sous Napoleon I.\" 1804–1811 (1874). He watched attentively the role played by Russia, and soon observed how much to the interest of France, a good entente with this power would be.\n\nHe accordingly threw himself into the study of Russian history, staying in Russia in order to learn its language, institutions and customs. In 1874 he took part in the 3rd Archeological Congress that was held in Kiev, and wrote a report on it for the \"Revue des Deux Mondes\". On his return, he published \"La Russie épique\", a study of the dumas, Ukrainian epic songs (1876), a short but excellent \"Histoire de la Russie depuis les origines jusqu'à l'année 1877\" (1878; 5th ed., 1900), \"Français et Russes, Moscou et Sévastopol\" 1812–1854 (1876; 2nd ed., 1881), and finally the two important volumes on Russian diplomatic history in the \"Recueil des Instructions données aux ambassadeurs\" (vols. vii. and ix., 1890 and 1891). He was not improbably moved by considerations of foreign policy to publish his \"Russes et Prussiens, guerre de Sept Ans\" (1895), a popular work, though based on solid research. After teaching history in the Faculties of Arts at Caen (1871) and Nancy (1873), he was called to the Sorbonne (1883), where he was the first to occupy the chair of contemporary history.\n\nBy this time he had already entered into politics; he had been \"chef du cabinet\" of Jules Ferry (1879–1881), though this did not distract him from his literary work. It was under these conditions that he composed his \"Histoire de la civilisation française\" (2 vols., 1885, 1887; 9th ed., 1901) and his \"Histoire de la civilisation contemporaine en France\" (1888; new ed. entirely revised, 1906), and undertook the general editorship of the \"Histoire générale du IVe siècle jusqu'à nos jours\". The plan of this great work had been drawn up with the aid of Ernest Lavisse, but the entire supervision of its execution was carried out by Rambaud. He contributed to it himself some interesting chapters on the history of the East, of which he had a thorough knowledge. In 1885 Rambaud published, in collaboration with J. B. Baille, a French translation of J.R. Seeley's \"Expansion of England\", and in the preface he laid great emphasis on the enormous increase of power brought to England by the possession of her colonies, seeing in this a lesson for France.\n\nHe was anxious to see the rise of a Greater France, on the model of Greater Britain, and it was with this idea that he undertook to present to the public a series of essays written by famous explorers or political men, under the title of \"La France coloniale, histoire, geographie, commerce\" (1886; 6th ed., 1893).\n\nHaving become senator for the \"département\" of Doubs (1895–1902), Rambaud held the position of minister of Public Instruction from 29 April 1896 to 28 June 1898, and in that capacity endeavoured to carry on the educational work of Jules Ferry, to whose memory he always remained faithful. He dedicated to his former chief a book (\"Jules Ferry\", 1903), which is a valuable testimony to the efforts made by France to organize public education and found a colonial empire; but this fidelity also won him some enemies, who succeeded for some time in preventing him from becoming a member of the Institute. He was finally elected a member of the Académie des Sciences morales et politiques on 11 December 1897 in place of the duc d'Aumale, of whose life he wrote an account (vol. xxii., 2nd series, of the \"Mémoires\" of this academy). His many interests ended by wearing out even his robust constitution, and he died at Paris in 1905.\n"}
{"id": "2241111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241111", "title": "Why Didn't They Ask Evans?", "text": "Why Didn't They Ask Evans?\n\nWhy Didn't They Ask Evans? is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie, first published in the United Kingdom by the Collins Crime Club in September 1934 and in the United States by Dodd, Mead and Company in 1935 under the title of The Boomerang Clue.\n\nThe UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00.\n\nBobby Jones finds a man dying at his local golf course. A photo he saw in the man's pocket is replaced, as police seek his identity. Bobby and his friend Lady Frances Derwent have adventures as they solve the mystery of the man's last words: \"Why didn't they ask Evans?\"\n\nThe novel was praised at first publication as \"a story that tickles and tantalises\", and that the reader is sure to like the amateur detectives and forgive the absence of Poirot. It had a lively narrative, full of action, with two amateur detectives who \"blend charm and irresponsibility with shrewdness and good luck\". Robert Barnard, writing in 1990, called it \"Lively\" but compared it to Evelyn Waugh's \"Vile Bodies\" and felt that the detectives were too much the amateurs.\n\nBobby Jones is playing golf with Dr Thomas in the Welsh seaside town of Marchbolt. Seeking the golf ball he hit over the cliff edge, he sees a man lying below. The doctor says the man is fatally injured and seeks help. Bobby stays with the man, who briefly regains consciousness, says \"Why didn't they ask Evans?\", and then dies. Bobby finds a photograph of a beautiful woman in the man's coat pocket, but no identification. Roger Bassington-ffrench, a stranger wearing plus fours, offers to stay with the body so Bobby can play the organ at his father's church.\n\nThe dead man is identified as Alex Pritchard by his sister, Amelia Cayman, at the inquest. She is said to be the woman in the photograph; Bobby wonders how such a beautiful girl could become such a coarse older woman. After the inquest, Mrs Cayman and her husband want to know if Pritchard had any last words. Bobby says that he did not. Later, when talking with his friend Frankie (Lady Frances Derwent), Bobby remembers that Pritchard did have last words and writes to the Caymans to tell them.\n\nBobby receives and rejects an unexpected job offer from a firm in Buenos Aires. Soon afterwards Bobby nearly dies after drinking from a poisoned bottle of beer. The local police do not pursue this. Frankie thinks Bobby is targeted for murder. Bobby agrees when he sees the issue of the local paper with the photograph used to find Pritchard's sister. Bobby sees that it is not the one he found in the dead man's pocket. He and Frankie realise that Bassington-ffrench swapped the photographs and that Mrs Cayman is not related to the dead man at all. Bobby and Frankie search for Bassington-ffrench. They trace him to Merroway Court in Hampshire, owned by Roger's brother and sister-in-law, Henry and Sylvia. They stage a car accident outside the house with the help of a doctor friend so that Frankie, feigning injury, will be invited to stay to recover. Frankie produces a newspaper cutting about the mysterious dead man; Sylvia remarks that he looks like Alan Carstairs, a traveller and big-game hunter who was a friend of John Savage, a millionaire who had killed himself after learning he had terminal cancer.\n\nFrankie meets two neighbours of the Bassington-ffrenches – Dr Nicholson and his younger wife, Moira. Dr Nicholson runs a local sanatorium. Frankie gets Bobby to investigate the establishment. On the grounds at night, Bobby encounters a girl who says that she fears for her life; she is the original of the photograph that Bobby found in the dead man's pocket. Several days later, Moira Nicholson turns up at the local inn where Bobby stays in his disguise as Frankie's chauffeur. She says her husband is trying to kill her and says she knew Alan Carstairs before her marriage to the doctor. Bobby introduces her to Frankie. Moira suggests they ask Roger if he took the photograph from the body of the dead man. Roger admits that he took the photo, recognising Moira and wanting to avoid scandal for her. Frankie leaves after Henry is found dead in his home, an apparent suicide.\n\nInterested in the will of the late John Savage, Frankie consults her family's solicitor in London and learns that Carstairs consulted him too. Savage was staying with Mr and Mrs Templeton when he became convinced he had cancer, although one specialist told him he was perfectly well. When he died by suicide, his will left seven hundred thousand pounds to the Templetons, who have apparently since left England. Carstairs was on their trail when he was killed. Bobby is kidnapped and Frankie is lured to the same isolated cottage by Roger. They manage to turn the tables on him with the timely arrival of Badger Beadon and find a drugged Moira in the house. When the police arrive, Roger has escaped.\n\nBobby and Frankie trace the witnesses to the signing of John Savage's will. They are the former cook and gardener of Mr and Mrs Templeton. Mr Templeton is also known as Mr Leo Cayman. The cook says that Gladys, the parlourmaid, was not asked to witness the will, made the night before Savage died. Frankie realises that the cook and gardener did not see Mr Savage before the signing, while the parlourmaid did and would have realised that it was Roger in the \"deathbed\" who wrote the will and not Mr Savage. The parlourmaid is Gladys Evans, hence the reason for Carstairs' question, \"Why didn't they ask Evans?\"\n\nTracing the parlourmaid, they discover she is now the married housekeeper at Bobby's home. Carstairs was trying to find her. Returning to Wales, they find Moira, who claims she is being followed by Roger and has come to them for help. Frankie is not deceived and spoils Moira's attempt to poison their coffee. Moira was Mrs Templeton and is Roger's co-conspirator. Moira then attempts to shoot Frankie and Bobby in the café when she is exposed, but is overpowered and arrested. Several weeks later, Frankie receives a letter from Roger, posted from South America, in which he confesses to murdering Carstairs, murdering his brother, and conspiring in all of Moira's past crimes. Bobby and Frankie realise they are in love and become engaged.\n\n\nThe name of the novel's hero – Bobby Jones – is the same as that of the American golfer who was at the height of his fame at the time of publication. The first chapter introduces \"Bobby Jones\" playing golf; when his stroke scuds disappointingly along the ground, the narrative explains this Bobby is not the American master.\n\nThe \"Times Literary Supplement\" (27 September 1934) concluded favourably, \"Mrs Christie describes the risks (Bobby Jones and Frankie Derwent) ran in her lightest and most sympathetic manner, playing with her characters as a kitten will play with a ball of wool, and imposing no greater strain on her readers than the pleasure of reading at a sitting a story that tickles and tantalises but never exhausts their patience or ingenuity\".\n\nIsaac Anderson in \"The New York Times Book Review\" (18 September 1935) concluded, \"Frankie and Bobby are not nearly so brilliant as amateur detectives usually are in books, but you are sure to like them, and you may even be able to forgive Agatha Christie for leaving out Hercule Poirot just this once.\"\n\n\"The Observer\" (16 September 1934) started off by saying that, \"there is an engaging zest about Agatha Christie's latest novel\" and concluded that, \"the narrative is lively\" and \"the story is full of action.\" \n\nMilward Kennedy in his review in \"The Guardian\" of 21 September 1934 said after summarising the set-up of the plot that, \"Poirot has no part in this book; instead, a young man and a young woman who blend charm and irresponsibility with shrewdness and good luck contrive amusingly and successfully to usurp the functions of the police. The fault which I find is the overimportance of luck. For the villains it was, for example, singular good luck which enabled them to discover and identify an obscure vicar's fourth son asleep on a solitary picnic; it was very bad luck for them that he was able to assimilate a sixteenth times fatal dose of morphia. They were lucky, again, in having always at hand just the properties required to make an extempore murder seem something else; and as for the Bright Young Couple – but these are defects which are little noticeable in the gay stream of Mrs Christie's narrative. Perhaps I should not have noticed them had I not read the book so quickly that, in a secluded village, there was nothing for it next day but to read it again with a sterner eye but no less enjoyment.\"\n\nRobert Barnard wrote of the book in 1980 that it was \"Lively, with occasional glimpses of a \"Vile Bodies\" world, though one short on Waugh's anarchic humour and long on snobbery ('Nobody looks at a chauffeur the way they look at a person').\" His critique was that the novel was \"Weakened by lack of proper detective: the investigating pair are bumbling amateurs, with more than a touch of Tommy and Tuppence\"\n\n\nThe novel was first published in the US in the \"Redbook\" magazine in a condensed version in the issue for November 1933 (Volume 62, Number 1) under the title \"The Boomerang Clue\" with illustrations by Joseph Franké. This version was then published in \"Six Redbook Novels\" by The McCall Company in 1933, prior to the publication of the full text by Dodd Mead in 1935. The other five condensed novels in this volume were \"The Thin Man\" by Dashiell Hammett, \"The Figure in the Fog\" by Mignon G. Eberhart, \"The Cross of Peace\" by Philip Gibbs, \"White Piracy\" by James Warner Bellah and \"Parade Ground\" by Charles L Clifford.\n\nThe dedication of the book reads:\n\"To Christopher Mallock\nin memory of Hinds\"\n\nThe Mallock family were friends of Christie's from the years before her first marriage. They staged amateur theatricals at their house, Cockington Court, near Torquay in which Christie, managing to overcome her usual crippling shyness, took part. The allusion to Hinds is unknown.\n\nThe blurb on the inside flap of the dustjacket of the first UK edition (which is also repeated opposite the title page) reads:\"Believe it or not, Bobby Jones had topped his drive! He was badly bunkered. There were no eager crowds to groan with dismay. That is easily explained – for Bobby was merely the fourth son of the Vicar of Marchbolt, a small golfing resort on the Welsh coast. And Bobby, in spite of his name, was not much of a golfer. Still, that game was destined to be a memorable one. On going to play his ball, Bobby suddenly came upon the body of a man. He bent over him. The man was not yet dead. \"Why didn't they ask Evans?\" he said, and then the eyelids dropped, the jaw fell... It was the beginning of a most baffling mystery. That strange question of the dying man is the recurring theme of Agatha Christie's magnificent story. Read it and enjoy it.\"\n\nThis novel has been translated to various languages other than its original English. Twenty-six are listed here, some published as recently as 2014. This is in keeping with the author's reputation for being the most translated author. \n\n\n\"Why Didn't They Ask Evans\" was adapted by London Weekend Television and transmitted on 30 March 1980. Before this production, there had been relatively few adaptations of Christie's work on the small screen as it was a medium she disliked and she had not been impressed with previous efforts, in particular a transmission of \"And Then There Were None\" on 20 August 1949 when several noticeable errors went out live (including one of the \"corpses\" standing up and walking off set in full view of the cameras). By the 1960s she emphatically refused to grant television rights to her works.\n\nAfter Christie's death in 1976, her estate, principally managed by her daughter Rosalind Hicks, relaxed this ruling and \"Why Didn't They Ask Evans\" was the first major production that resulted. \"Evans\" attracted large audiences and satisfactory reviews, but more importantly, it demonstrated to television executives that Christie's work could be successful for the small screen given the right budgets, stars and attention to detail – \"Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime\", \"Miss Marple\" with Joan Hickson (who had a minor role in \"Evans\"), \"Agatha Christie's Poirot\" with David Suchet and \"Marple\" with Geraldine McEwan, until her retirement, and now with Julia Mackenzie, can all trace their style and successes back to this 1980 adaptation.\n\nGiven a generous budget of one million pounds, a large sum for the time, it had an all-star cast and a three-month shooting and videotaping schedule. Problems were encountered during the 1979 ITV strike which lasted three months and led to replacement production personnel when the strike ended, including a second director. The original intention was that the 180-minute teleplay would be transmitted as a three-part \"mini-serial\", but ITV then decided to show it as a three-hour special with maximum publicity, especially for Francesca Annis in the role of Frankie (Annis was a major name in UK television at the time, having played the title role in \"Lillie\", the story of Lillie Langtry, two years before).\n\nThe production was faithful to the plot and dialogue of the book. Two notable changes were made. The first is the recognition in the isolated cottage that Dr Nicholson is Roger Bassington-ffrench in disguise. In the novel, it is Bobby who recognises the deception as the man's ear-lobes are different from those of the doctor whom he had glimpsed previously. In the adaptation, Frankie witnesses one of Nicholson's patients attacking him in the sanatorium when his face is badly scratched. In the cottage, she realises the scratches have disappeared. The second change comes at the end when, instead of writing to Frankie from South America, Roger lures her to a deserted Merroway Court, makes much the same confession as appears in the book's letter and tells her he loves her, asking her to join him. When she refuses, he locks her in a room of the house (to be freed by Bobby the next day) but does not harm her as he makes his escape abroad. The production was first screened on US television as part of \"Mobil Showcase\" on 21 May 1981, introduced by Peter Ustinov.\n\nAdaptor: Pat Sandys\nExecutive Producer: Tony Wharmby\nProducer: Jack Williams\nDirectors: John Davies and Tony Wharmby\nArtwork: John Tribe\n\nPrincipal Cast:\nFrancesca Annis as Lady Frances (Frankie) Derwent\nLeigh Lawson as Roger Bassington-ffrench\nJames Warwick as Bobby Jones\nConnie Booth as Sylvia Bassington-ffrench\nJohn Gielgud as Reverend Jones\nBernard Miles as Dr Thomas\nEric Porter as Dr Nicholson\nMadeline Smith as Moira Nicholson\nDoris Hare as Rose Pratt\nJoan Hickson as Mrs Rivington\nRoy Boyd as Alan Carstairs\nJames Cossins as Henry Bassington-ffrench<br>\nRobert Longden as Badger Beadon \n\nPatrick Barlow loosely reworked Christie's novel as a two-hour television film starring Julia McKenzie as Miss Marple, who does not appear in the original novel.

It was repealed under the direct rule of the British government, by the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987.\n\nIt was bitterly resented by nationalists who saw the Act as being deliberately designed to suppress their identity. Although it did not refer explicitly to the Irish tricolour, it did the Union Flag. The Act gave the Royal Ulster Constabulary a positive duty to remove any flag or emblem from public or private property which was considered to be likely to cause a breach of the peace, but legally exempted the Union Flag from ever being considered a breach of the peace. As a result, of all the flags likely to be displayed in Northern Ireland, almost exclusively the Irish tricolour would be deemed a breach of the peace. However the Act was not a wholesale ban on the Irish flag, and it was often allowed to remain flying, especially at GAA grounds.\n\nThe Act was introduced at a time of some turmoil within unionism in Northern Ireland, dissent that was viewed with alarm by the Ulster Unionist government, and the legislation was initiated amid the pressure emanating from that dissent. Hard line unionists accused the government of appeasing nationalists; a more lenient approach by government to some nationalist parades had led to an increase in the flying of the Irish Tricolour. Likewise, the Coronation celebrations had led to the erection of Union Flags, not only in unionist enclaves, but in nationalist areas where disputes erupted and where some Union Flags were taken down and replaced with Tricolours. Nationalists had also organised boycotts of shops which openly celebrated the coronation with the display of the Union Flag, increasing tension and unionist fears. The Act took over some of the powers of the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922.\n\nViolations of the Act were punishable by up to a fine up to £500, or up to five years in prison.\n\nThe enforcement of the Act could on occasion lead to rioting, most notoriously during the UK General Election of 1964 on the lower Falls Road in Belfast.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2241152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241152", "title": "Kettle corn", "text": "Kettle corn\n\nKettle corn is a sweet-and-salty variety of popcorn that is typically mixed or seasoned with a light-colored refined sugar, salt, and oil. It was traditionally made in cast iron kettles, hence the name, but in modern times other types of pots and pans are used.\n\nKettle corn was introduced to the United States in the 18th century. It is referenced in the diaries of Dutch settlers in Pennsylvania circa 1776. It was a treat sold at fairs or consumed at other festive occasions. The corn, oil, sugar, and salt are cooked together in a cast iron kettle, or possibly a Dutch oven. This produces a noticeable sweet crust on the popcorn; however, this method requires constant stirring or the sugar will burn. Alternatively, a batch of plain popped corn can be sweetened with sugar or honey before adding salt. This combination was widely popular in the early 19th century but fell from wide usage during the 20th century.\n\nIn the early 21st century, kettle corn made a comeback in America, especially at 19th-century living history events. It is cooked and sold at fairs and flea markets throughout the United States, especially art and craft shows. Although modern kettle corn is commonly cooked in stainless steel or copper kettles because of their lighter weight, cast iron cauldrons are still used to publicly cook the corn and mix the ingredients to retain the original flavor. Recipes for homemade kettle corn are available, and microwave popcorn versions are sold.\n\n"}

It was designed and programmed by Robert Jaeger and published by Parker Brothers. The game's title references a colloquial expression for diarrhea contracted while visiting Mexico.\n\nA version was released for the Master System in 1988, and for iOS and Android in 2012. The Android version has since been removed from the Google Play store.\n\n\"Montezuma's Revenge\" is an early example of the Metroidvania genre. The player controls a character called Panama Joe (a.k.a. Pedro), moving him from room to room in the labyrinthine underground pyramid of the 16th century Aztec temple of emperor Montezuma II, filled with enemies, obstacles, traps, and dangers. The objective is to score points by gathering jewels and killing enemies along the way. Panama Joe must find keys to open doors, collect and use equipment such as torches, swords, amulets, etc., and avoid or defeat the challenges in his path. Obstacles are laser gates, conveyor belts, disappearing floors and fire pits.\n\nMovement is achieved by jumping, running, sliding down poles, and climbing chains and ladders. Enemies are skulls, snakes, and spiders. The player has a limited number of inventory slots for carrying items, and cannot collect any other items or jewels if all slots are filled. A further complication arises in the bottom-most floors of each pyramid, which must be played in total darkness unless a torch is found.\n\nThe pyramid is nine floors deep, not counting the topmost entry room that the player drops into at the start of each level, and has 99 rooms to explore. The goal is to reach the Treasure Chamber, whose entrance is in the center room of the lowest level. After jumping in here, the player has a short time to jump from one chain to another and pick up as many jewels as possible. However, jumping onto a fireman's pole will immediately take the player to the next level; when time runs out, the player is automatically thrown onto the pole.\n\nThere are nine difficulty levels in all. Though the basic layout of the pyramid remains the same from one level to the next, small changes in details force the player to rethink strategy. These changes include:\n\n\nThe player can reach only the left half of the pyramid in level 1, and only the right half in level 2. Starting with level 3, the entire pyramid is open for exploration.\n\nThe sound track of the game for the Atari 8 bit computer is a musical adaptation of Spanish Flea and the first few notes of La Cucaracha when collecting items.\n\nRobert Jaeger had previously written \"Chomper\" (a \"Pac-Man\" clone) and \"Pinhead\" (a \"Kick Man\" clone). In 1983, Jaeger's friend Mark Sunshine suggested Jaeger make a game with a Meso-American theme and call it Montezuma's Revenge. Jaeger, who was only 16 at the time, exhibited the still-unfinished game with his father at a consumer electronics convention. Parker Brothers officials expressed interest and quickly convinced Jaeger to sign the rights over to them. On the title screen of the shipping game, Mark Sunshine is credited for the concept.\n\nThe original game that Jaeger developed for the Atari 800 used the entire 48K of memory in the computer. However, Parker Brothers wanted to release the game on cartridge as this format would be easier for children to handle than magnetic media, so they trimmed the game down to fit in 16K. The original disk version contains many features omitted from the smaller cartridge versions, including an animated title and character introduction, replacement and bonus life animations, a high-score entry screen, and a bat obstacle. The played character also features a different hat and is named Pedro rather than Panama Joe. This version contains an unfinished boss screen featuring a gigantic King Montezuma who can stomp the player character to death. This screen is unfinished, and therefore the original version of the game cannot be completed.\n\nParker Brothers released console versions for the Colecovision, Atari 2600, and Atari 5200, and computer versions for the Apple II, Commodore 64, IBM PC, and Atari 8-bit family. The North American video game crash of 1983 caused Parker Brothers's video game sales to plummet, so to reduce costs they released the Commodore 64 and Atari 8-bit versions on disk instead of the intended cartridges and also put two versions of the game on one floppy. The computer versions of \"Montezuma's Revenge\" thus came on \"flippy\" disks with the Commodore and Atari ports piggybacked and likewise for the Apple and IBM versions. (Although in Europe standard cassette tape versions were released for both C64 and Atari 8 bit platforms as well)The IBM port uses a CPU-based speed loop and thus will run too fast to be playable on 286 and up machines. A cassette tape version was developed separately in the UK for the Sinclair Spectrum. The Atari 2600 cartridge is 8K and has half the levels of the other versions.\n\nIn 1988, a port was published for the Master System, which retains the basic gameplay and level structure, but with improved graphics, sound, and additional features. This version was outsourced to Micro Smiths, a company led by Mark Lesser who previously worked for Parker Bros. on \"\".\n\nIn 1998 a 3D first-person game was developed for Microsoft Windows by Utopia Technologies called \"Montezuma's Return!\" A 2D version of that game for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color was developed by Tarantula Studios.\n\nAtari 2600 games became challenges for Artificial intelligence researchers. In 2013, progress was made on general algorithms which could learn to play multiple games, but they failed on \"Montezuma's Revenge\" and \"Pitfall!\". In 2018, researchers from OpenAI made progress on \"Montezuma's Revenge\". Later in the year Uber developed Go-Explore, a new approach to reinforcement learning, which could easily handle both of these games.\n\n"}

It was released in Japan on June 16, 2005.\n\nBandai also planned to release this game on Nintendo DS and Sony PlayStation Portable but it was cancelled.\n\nHere is a list of playable characters, characters in italics have to be unlocked throughout story mode.\n\n\nIn \"Inuyasha: Feudal Combat\", up to four characters, two per team, may be present at once in a battle, however, two player characters cannot be on the same team. (IE: Player 1 as main fighter; Player 2 as their partner) Both the player and opponent may each select another character as their partner. There are four modes of gameplay, including Story, Mission, Battle, and Practice modes.\n\nWhen the Spirit Gauge is full, a special Finishing Move can be performed. Each character's basic Finishing Move can be activated by pressing and holding the circle button. But when a character is fighting alongside a partner and the duo reaches Great affinity, pressing circle will trigger a combined Finishing Move, a combined team attack between the two characters. Certain player/partner combinations will have their own special finishing move together. Those combinations are:\n\n\nFour different formations (the different ways the player's partner can assist the player) can be selected during the battle: Wind formation (partner mimics the actions of the player), Forest formation (the player and the partner are always targeted on different opponents), Mountain formation (partner stays between the player and opponent and blocks enemy attacks) or Fire formation (both player and partner focus on the same opponent and attack continuously). The Fire and Mountain formations also increase the strength and defense of the player and partner, respectively.\n\nAffinity will have an effect on what the characters say to each other.\n\n\nAlso, some characters will have a certain affinity from the start. For example, Inuyasha and Koga will have a low affinity, however, Inuyasha and Kagome will have a high affinity.\n\nIn Story Mode, the player must choose to follow first Inuyasha's, then Sango and Miroku, then Sesshomaru's, and finally Shippo's \"Chapter\". These consist of a series of battles interlaced with cut scenes illustrating a story. If the player is KO'd (knocked out) in one of these battles, a screen with the option to reattempt the last battle is available. If each of these stories is completed without the player getting KO'd even once, then a new character can be selected in \"Battle\", \"Practice\", and \"Mission\" modes as the player/partner. Those characters are:\n\n\nThe game received \"mixed\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\n\n"}

He authored the Eighteenth Amendment (Prohibition) and introduced it in the Senate, he is referred to as \"the father of national Prohibition.\"\n\nSheppard was born in Morris County in east Texas, the oldest of seven children, to lawyer John Levi Sheppard, later a judge and United States Representative; and his wife, the former Margaret Alice Eddins.\n\nThrough his mother Margaret, Morris was a direct descendant of Robert Morris (1734–1806) of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a financier who had signed the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the United States Constitution.\n\nSheppard received his B.A. degree from the University of Texas at Austin in 1895, and an LL.B. from the University of Texas School of Law in 1897. While in law school Sheppard became a member of the Methodist Church, and became friendly with two classmates, future Governor Pat Neff, and future U.S. Senator Tom Connally. In 1898, he received his LL.M. from Yale Law School.\n\nHe began practicing law with his father in Pittsburg, Texas and later Texarkana.\n\nIn 1902, Morris Sheppard was elected as a Democrat to replace his deceased father in the United States House of Representatives. He held the seat until his resignation in 1913, when the Texas legislature elected him to the United States Senate. He served as Democratic whip between 1929 and 1933.\n\nIn the 1928 presidential election, Texas voters abandoned the Democratic candidate, Alfred E. Smith, Governor of New York and a Catholic, carrying the state for Republican Herbert Hoover and contributing to his victory. In the summer of 1929, the First Lady Lou Hoover arranged the traditional teas for wives of congressmen, inviting Jessie De Priest, wife of Oscar Stanton De Priest of Chicago, the first African American elected to Congress in the 20th century. Senator Sheppard was among those who objected to this invitation, quoted as saying, \"I regret the incident beyond measure. It is recognition of social equality between the white and black races and is fraught with infinite danger to our white civilization.\"\n\nSheppard held his Senate seat until his death in Washington, D.C. in 1941. Then-Representative Lyndon B. Johnson ran for Sheppard's Senate seat in the 1941 special election, and lost to Governor W. Lee O'Daniel.\n\nAs Senator, Sheppard sponsored progressive reform legislation promoting rural credit programs, child labor laws, and antitrust laws. He was also an advocate of Women's suffrage in the United States. But he supported the maintenance in Texas and the South of racial segregation in public facilities and the disenfranchisement of blacks.\n\nDuring his tenure, Sheppard was a vocal supporter of the temperance movement. He helped write the Webb–Kenyon Act (1913) to regulate the interstate shipment of alcoholic beverages, authored the Sheppard Bone-Dry Act (1916) to impose prohibition on the District of Columbia, introduced the Senate resolution for the Eighteenth Amendment establishing national prohibition, and helped write the Volstead Act which provided for its enforcement.\n\nHowever, during the Prohibition era, a still that produced 130 gallons of moonshine per day was discovered on a Texas ranch that Sheppard owned.\n\nWhen a resolution calling for a Twenty-first Amendment to repeal prohibition was introduced to the Senate by John J. Blaine, Sheppard filibustered it for eight-and-a-half hours. He was not helped by a single Dry Senator and he relented, the motion passing by 63 votes to 23.\n\nCo-sponsored by Morris Sheppard and Horace Mann Towner, the Sheppard–Towner Act of 1921 provided Federal matching funds for services aimed to reduce maternal and infant mortality. The funding included: midwife training; visiting nurses for pregnant women and new mothers; distribution of nutrition and hygiene information; health clinics, doctors and nurses, for pregnant women, mothers and children.\n\nSenator Morris Sheppard and Congressman Wright Patman are considered the fathers of the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934. Sheppard was the act's author. The bill had stalled in the United States House of Representatives considerably shortening the time the Senate had to pass the final version. Rather than sending the bill to a Conference Committee, Sheppard asked the United States Senate to pass the bill unanimously without reading the bill or the amendments. The bill passed the Senate unanimously. The Morris Sheppard Credit Union in Texarkana, Texas carries the Senator's name, while the institution's local credit union chapter is named after Congressman Patman.\n\nOn December 1, 1909, Sheppard married Lucile Sanderson. The couple had three daughters: Susan, Lucile, and Janet. Some of their descendants also became politicians.\n\nSheppard and his wife were the grandparents of Connie Mack, III, Republican U.S. Senator from Florida, and great-grandparents of Connie Mack IV, Republican U.S. Representative from Florida. Other Sheppard grandsons were Democrat Richard Sheppard Arnold (1936–2004) and Republican Morris Sheppard \"Buzz\" Arnold (born 1941), judges at different times on the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, and later concurrently on the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, the only brothers to serve concurrently on a US federal court of appeals. The federal courthouse in Little Rock is named in Judge Richard Arnold's honor. Judge Morris Arnold, a Republican, remains on the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit under senior status.\n\nSheppard died in office of a brain hemorrhage on April 9, 1941. He is interred at Hillcrest Cemetery in Texarkana, Texas. Andrew Jackson Houston was appointed senator in his place until a special election could be held.\n\nThe year following Sheppard's death, his widow Lucile Sanderson Sheppard married Tom Connally, also a United States Senator from Texas. Senator Connally also pre-deceased Lucile. When she died in 1980, she was buried with her first husband Morris Sheppard in Hillcrest Cemetery.\n\n\n"}

It is affiliated with the University of Chicago. Almost half of the students have a parent who is on the faculty or staff of the University.\n\nThe Laboratory Schools were founded by American educator John Dewey in 1896 in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago. Calvin Brainerd Cady was director of the music department under Dewey. The school began as a progressive educational institution that goes from nursery school through 12th grade. This experiment was an integral part of the University of Chicago during the years 1896 to 1904, and was an undertaking which aimed to work put, through the University, a school system which should be an organic whole from the kindergarten to the university. Conducted under the management and supervision of the University's Department of Philosophy, Psychology, and Education, it bore the same relation to the work of that department that a laboratory bears to biology, physics, or chemistry. Like any such laboratory it had two main purposes: (1) to exhibit, test, verify, and criticize theoretical statements and principles; and (2) to add to the sum of facts and principles in its special line. For it was part of the philosophical and psychological theory he entertained that ideas, even as ideas, are incomplete and tentative until they are employed in application to objects in action and are thus developed, corrected, and tested. The need of a laboratory was indicated. John Dewey, when called to be the head of the department in 1894, had arrived at certain philosophical and psychological ideas which he desired to test in practical application. In consequence, it was labeled as the Laboratory School (Mayhew & Edwards, 1966).\n\nThe Laboratory Schools consists of two interrelated campuses. The Historic Campus, located at 1362 East 59th Street, fills two full city blocks. It houses grades 3–12 (about 1,200 students) in five connected buildings: Blaine Hall (built in 1903), Belfield Towers (1904), Judd Hall (1931), the high school (built in 1960), the middle school (1993), and Gordon Parks Arts Hall (2015) which has 100 classrooms. Two connected gymnasiums also sit on this campus, Sunny Gym (built in 1929) and Kovler Gymnasium (built in 2000) and students have access to both Scammon Gardens and Jackman Field.\n\nIn September 2013, Lab opened Earl Shapiro Hall on its new Early Childhood Campus located at 5800 South Stony Island Avenue. This new building, designed by Valerio Dewalt Train and FGM Architects, is home to approximately 625 children in nursery through second grade. The building is named for Earl Shapiro, who graduated from Lab in 1956.\n\nThe school has over 2,160 students in Pre-Kindergarten – Grade 12.\nToday the school is divided into a Nursery School (Pre-K and Kindergarten), Primary School (grades 1 and 2), Lower School (grades 3 through 5), Middle School (grades 6 through 8), and High School (grades 9 through 12). Many children begin in nursery school and continue through their high school graduation, and 75% of applications are for nursery school or 9th grade. The student/teacher ratio is 8:1.\n\nThe school was ranked fourth in the nation for its record of sending graduates to elite universities and colleges. From 2012–2016, some of the colleges at which U-High students matriculated were: University of Chicago (71 students), New York University (20 students), Northwestern University (19 students), Yale University (15 students), Stanford University (11 students), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (9 students), Brown University (9 students), Johns Hopkins University (9 students), Princeton University (7 students), Columbia University (7 students), Harvard University (3 students).\n\nU-High offers more than 150 different classes. All are college preparatory in nature and there are 22 Advanced Placement or Advanced Topic courses. High school students may also take classes at the University of Chicago at no extra charge, and about 20 do so each year. The average composite ACT score is 31.5. The school maintains four separate libraries which collectively hold over 110,000 volumes.\n\nHigh school students may choose from 40+ different clubs and activities. The high school math, science, and Model UN teams are regular contenders for – and winners of – state titles. The school's newspaper (The Midway) and the yearbook (U-Highlights) regularly win regional and national awards, as does its arts magazine, \"Renaissance.\" Other popular activities include theater, ethnic clubs, Student Council, policy debate, and Model UN. The Model UN team is consistently ranked among the top in the nation, and is world-renowned for its competitive excellence. In 2011, it was ranked the #2 High School Model UN team in the United States. In 2018, Lab's Model UN team won the Best Large Delegation award at the Harvard Model UN conference. In addition, the Debate Team has won numerous national circuit tournaments, and is unofficially considered to be in the Top 20 nationwide. Furthermore, U-High's Math and Science teams consistently win and place at Regional and State competitions, respectively.\n\nOrganized by the Office of Alumni Relations Development, members of the student body at U-High are nominated by faculty to serve in the Maroon Key Society. The Maroon Key Society serve as ambassadors for the school, and they help provide tours to visiting alumni, potential students, and other guests to the school.\n\nThe school's athletic teams, the Maroons, compete in the Independent School League (ISL) and are members of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA). The middle school fields 15 teams in baseball, basketball, cross country, soccer, track, and girls volleyball. The high school has more than 25 teams: baseball, basketball, cross country, fencing, golf, squash, sailing, soccer, swimming, tennis, indoor and outdoor track & field, and girls volleyball. All operate with a \"no cut policy,\" meaning any student who wishes to participate may, and nearly 65% of U-Highers participate on at least one team.\n\nThe high school's extracurricular activities occasionally make national and international news. For example, in 1990 then-Governor Thompson declared a \"Matthew Headrick Day\" and the US House made a proclamation when then-student Headrick appeared on talk shows including Today after winning the Westinghouse. In response to the award, the Chicago Tribune wrote: \"this ... is a ... school where being on the math team ... can actually enhance one's social status.\" The Tribune's coverage was controversial because, as noted previously, U-High's extracurricular activities, including the math team, operate on a \"no cut policy,\" and therefore participation was unlikely to confer social status. The faculty responded by posting a banner that humorously read: \"The Few. The Proud. The U-High Math Team. Conferring social status since 1990.\"\n\nHere are a few of the teachers who have worked at Lab:\n\n\nLab classrooms are visited by teachers and administrators who wish to experience the way Lab teachers integrate Dewey’s philosophy into their classroom experience.\n\n\n"}

He made his farewell speech on the motion: 'This House condemns the Indian policy of His Majesty's Government'. Kabir had also been involved with the student newspapers, the Isis and the Cherwell, and the Oxford Majlis journal, Bharat.\n\nUpon his return to India, Kabir taught at a number of universities. He also became involved in trade union politics and was elected to the Bengal Legislative Assembly in 1937. He took up a number of government posts after 1947, including Minister for Education.\n\nKabir published a book of poems in Oxford in 1932, and continued to write poetry, short stories and novels after his return to India.

{"id": "2241194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241194", "title": "What It Feels Like for a Girl", "text": "What It Feels Like for a Girl\n\n\"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" is a song recorded by American singer Madonna for her eighth studio album \"Music\" (2000). It was released as the third and final single from the album on April 16, 2001, by Maverick Records. Madonna and Guy Sigsworth wrote and produced the song with David Torn as co-writer, and Mark \"Spike\" Stent as a co-producer. \"What It Feels Like For a Girl\" is a mid-tempo electronic and synth-pop song, with filtered bass licks, tidal keys and pads as part of its instrumentation. Lyrically, it conveys society's double standard toward women, addressing hurtful myths about female inferiority. To emphasize the message, the song opens with a spoken word sample by actress Charlotte Gainsbourg from the 1993 British film \"The Cement Garden\". A Spanish version of the track, \"Lo Que Siente la Mujer\", was translated by Alberto Ferreras and included in the Latin American edition of \"Music\".\n\nThe song received acclaim from most music critics, who declared it as a highlight from the album, while also remarking it as one of the most mature musical ventures of Madonna's career. Commercially, \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" reached the top-ten of the record charts in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Romania, Spain, Scotland and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it peaked at number 23 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number-one on the Dance Club Songs chart.\n\nAn accompanying music video for the song was directed by Madonna's then-husband Guy Ritchie and premiered on March 22, 2001. It features the singer as a reckless woman on a crime spree. The video was criticized for its depiction of violence and abuse, which caused MTV to ban it before 9:00 pm. The single was also released on DVD and became the highest weekly sales for a DVD release in the United States. Madonna performed the track on the promotional concerts for \"Music\" in November 2000 and on her 2001 Drowned World Tour, where a remixed version was used as a video interlude and also performed in Spanish. The song was covered by the actors of television series \"Glee\", during the episode \"The Power of Madonna\", and was included in the .\n\nAfter the critical and commercial success of her seventh studio album, \"Ray of Light\" (1998), Madonna had intended to embark on a concert tour in September 1999, but the tour was cancelled due to the delay of her film \"The Next Best Thing\" (2000). She released one-off singles like \"Beautiful Stranger\" (1999) and a cover of Don McLean's \"American Pie\" (2000). The singer also became pregnant with her son Rocco, from her relationship with director Guy Ritchie. Wanting to distract herself from the media frenzy, Madonna concentrated on the development of her eighth studio album, \"Music\".\n\nIn April 2000, it was announced that French musician Mirwais Ahmadzaï was creating a melding of dance and pop songs with a disco feel for the album. Later, it was also announced that she enlisted Guy Sigsworth to work with her on the album. The singer had followed Sigsworth's work, admired his love of understated technology in music, and contacted him for adding an ambient feel to her record. Madonna played him the rough demo tracks developed for \"Music\", including the songs created with Ahmadzaï. The idea for \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" came to Madonna when she was halfway through her pregnancy and was trying to keep the media from finding out. Sigsworth sent her a demo backing track containing a sample from the 1993 British film \"The Cement Garden\", directed by Andrew Birkin, in which the voice of actress Charlotte Gainsbourg speaks softly, \"Girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short, wear shirts and boots. 'Cause it's OK to be a boy. But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading. 'Cause \"you\" think that \"being\" a girl is degrading. But secretly you'd love to know what it's like... Wouldn't you? What it feels like for a girl\".\n\nMadonna listened to the phrase uttered by Gainsbourg and started writing the song and the melody, resulting in \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\", a track described by her as a complaint about the politics of sexes. She was going through some emotional turmoil due to living on a different continent than her husband Guy Ritchie. Due to her pregnancy she decided to move to England to be close to him. \"Being the girl, I made the first compromise. It's that extra thing that [women] have. I don't think that we're better than men, but I believe there's an extra accommodating chromosome\", she told \"Interview\"s Ingrid Sischy. Madonna reflected on how her generation of women had been encouraged to be independent, be educated and take over any opportunity life bestowed upon them. But she had realized that being a smart and accomplished woman can come across as threat to men, thereby making them a casualty. Madonna questioned, \"Why didn't somebody tell me? Why didn't somebody warn me?' And that's also what that song is about—swallowing that bitter pill... It was a combination of that, and also just feeling incredibly vulnerable that inspired the song.\"\n\nSigsworth demo track was the second of two sketches presented to Madonna, and she chose the one with the sample from \"The Cement Garden\". It was almost finished but was still kept unpolished so that the singer could continue writing on top of it. He recorded the track at Sarm West Studios rather than his own studio since he did not want to \"fuck up\" working with Madonna. The song was finished quickly and within four days they were able to create the final version. From the first day onward Madonna and Sigsworth decided to keep all the musical noises from the demo. So the producer had to find a way to reposition Madonna's vocals around the segments, utilizing Pro Tools on a SSL 9000 J console. Madonna insisted Sigsworth to give her a rough approximate sound, rather than work on the music for two-three hours. That way they would know if it can be kept or rejected and save time on production. During recording, Sigsworth noticed that the verses were out of sync with the music and wanted to add extra bar which would help them be coherent. However Madonna dismissed it, and he had to cut up the individual music to put it in his computer for accompanying her vocals. Sigsworth thought it made the song sound more \"fluid and magical\" and commended Madonna for not taking the cop-out solution.\n\n\"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" is an electronic synth-pop semi-ballad. Madonna and Sigsworth were listed as songwriters and producers on the track with additional production by Mark \"Spike\" Stent. American guitarist David Torn was credited as an additional songwriter after Madonna found out Sigsworth had sampled from Torn's 1987 album, \"Cloud About Mercury\". Stent recorded \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" using a Sony 3348 HR and a BASF 931 tape. He mixed it at London's Olympic Studios using SSL G Series Quantegy magnetic tapes. Tim Young mastered the track at Metropolis Studio at Westminster, London.\nAccording to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, the song is set in common time, with a tempo of 104 beats per minutes. It's set in the key of E major, with Madonna's vocals spanning from the lower octave of G to the higher note of B. The song has a sequence of D–E–E/F–A during the verses and F–A–D–E during the chorus as its chord progression. The track begins with Gainsbourg's monologue which is followed by drum sounds, a rhythm section supported by string pads, and the chord sequence which highlights the melody. Madonna sings over a synth line the first verse, \"Silky smooth lips as sweet as candy, baby/Tight blue jeans, skin that shows in patches\" in a mellow and feminine tone, which is driven by a \"cool beat\" and filtered bass licks. The ambient production has a number of sounds floating in-and-out of the track, long echos and vocals being pulled back.\n\nAs the pre-chorus ends, the drums are pulled out and added immediately the chorus starts, washed over by tidal keys and pads, and Madonna asking the question, \"Do you know what it feels like for a girl?\". Phil Dellio from \"The Village Voice\" noticed the presence of \"gossamer-like\" synthesizer in the background, while author Rikky Rooksby highlighted the equalized bass guitar in the center of the production. Another characteristic Sigsworth feature is the sound of a CD player \"skipping\" during the song. A Spanish version of the track, titled \"Lo Que Siente la Mujer\" (English: \"What a Woman Feels\"), was translated by Alberto Ferreras and included as the B-side of the US CD maxi single release, as well as on the bonus disc of the 2001 Special Tour edition of \"Music\" and as a bonus track on the Mexican and Latin American editions. Stan Hawkins, author of \"Critical Musicological Reflections\", felt that by switching \"girl\" to \"woman\" in the Spanish version, Madonna had \"upgraded\" its nature. Lyrically, \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" condemns male chauvinism by addressing hurtful myths about female inferiority and female role-playing in society, with the singer inviting men to imagine themselves as girls.\n\n\"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" was initially planned to be the album's second single, but \"Don't Tell Me\" was chosen instead. The song was eventually released as the album's third single on April 17, 2001. Upon release, several remixes were commissioned, created by Above & Beyond, Victor Calderone, Richard \"Humpty\" Vission, Paul Oakenfold and Tracy Young. The \"Velvet Masta Mix\", created by Richard Vission, gave the song a bass-heavy intro and a funkier groove. Vission recalled that Madonna had turned down his first mix and asked him to redo it again. Calderone's \"Dark Side Mix\" was more mellow, relying more on percussions while Tracy Young's mix included stringed harp instrumentation. AllMusic's Jose F. Promis praised in particular the Oakenfold version for \"transforming the song into a massive, deep arena club stomper\". The Above & Beyond remix, which was used for the music video, features \"hard and rhythmic\" pumping beats and removed Madonna's verses, leaving only the chorus and repeating the Charlotte Gainsbourg sample several times in the middle.\n\nProduction duo Thunderpuss was hired to do an official remix of \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\". However, when they were almost finished, an unofficial remix, credited as \"The Thunderpuss Mix\", leaked on the internet. During an interview with About.com, Barry Harris from the group recalled that they had been working on the remix and were waiting for it to be approved when they received a call from Warner Bros. Records, informing them that the remix was circulating in the internet. Both Chris Cox and Harris tried to find out the issue and concluded that someone had retitled the original with their group's name and released it. Thunderpuss tried to convince the record label executives but failed and the remix was canceled.\n\nUpon release, the song received general acclaim from music critics. Rikky Rooksby wrote in his book, \"The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna\" (2004), that \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" was the best track on \"Music\". Author Lucy O'Brien described the song as having a \"beautifully executed sense of anger\" in her 2007 biography, \"\". Likening it to Madonna's 1989 single \"Express Yourself\", O'Brien called it a \"femme-pop\" song. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine picked it as one of the album's highlights, calling it a \"terrific midtempo cut\". \"Slant\"s Sal Cinquemani felt that \"Madonna has revealed more of herself than ever [in \"Music\"]. No longer shrouded with pedantic spirituality, she has become even more human [...] revealing her soul on 'What It Feels Like For A Girl'\". However, on his review of \"GHV2\", Cinquemani felt the track was \"largely lost amid the conventional sonics of \"Music\"s final single\" and called it that compilation's least dynamic offering, giving a C– rating. Eric Henderson, from the same magazine, wrote that \"occasionally, and only occasionally, Madonna’s reach exceeds her grasp. “What It Feels Like for a Girl” is one of those cases. Its intentions feel more fully fleshed out in the controversial music video than they do in the song itself\".\n\nNathan Smith from \"Houston Press\" opined it was \"one of the realest and most mature vocal performances of her career as she gently explores the double standard faced by ambitious women\". From \"Gay Star News\", Joe Morgan called it a \"clear reminder that Madonna can write some incredible lyrics\". Writing for \"Entertainment Weekly\", journalist David Browne relegated the track as \"an older, wiser 'Into the Groove'\", highlighting its \"softly padding beat and genuinely empathetic lyrics\". \"Q\" magazines Danny Eccleston picked it as a standout track, claiming it had \"the vaguest melodic echo of Basement Jaxx's terrific 'On & On'\". Cynthia Funchs of \"PopMatters\" picked the song as her favorite on the album, calling it \"outstanding\" with \"sweet, enchanted beats\". Eamon Sweeney of \"Hot Press\", found it similar, in tone and texture, to Natalie Imbruglia's 1998 single \"Smoke\". Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" called it \"Madonna's quasi-feminist statement\". \"Rolling Stone\"s Barry Walters called it \"as musically gentle as it is lyrically barbed\".\n\nGarry Mulholland of \"The Guardian\", praised its \"melancholy atmosphere and ambiguous air\". Also from \"The Guardian\", Maddy Costa thought that the track was \"exquisite\", adding \"on 'What It Feels Like for a Girl' you feel is the Madonna of old, talking about being a pop bitch and making you tingle even with its hackneyed lyrics\". Writing for \"Billboard\", Larry Flick hailed it \"a hook-laden midtempo jam [...] that should give the Britney/Christina generation of teenage female listeners a little food for thought\", highlighting its \"motherly, nurturing perspective\". Also from \"Billboard\", Chuck Taylor named it \"one of the more substantive – and mature – musical ventures of [Madonna's] career\", while panning its remix version for \"reduc[ing] the song to a mindless trickle of beats without any hints of the verses\". Alex Pappademas from \"Spin\", pointed out that the song \"flaunts the sexiest synth shimmer this side of [Aguilera's] 'Genie in a Bottle'\". \"The Village Voice\"s Phil Dellio found the song to be \"the perfect answer record to [the novel] \"The Virgin Suicides\" (where boys indeed stand on the side of the street looking uncomprehendingly towards girls)\". On a more critical note, Medium's Richard LaBeau opined that \"with better production it could have been a true classic\". Online magazine \"Queerty\" felt the Spanish version, \"Lo Que Siente la Mujer\", was \"an effort, we assume, to prove she \"can\" speak Spanish, damn it! Or at least memorize enough words to \"sound\" like she speaks Spanish\".\n\nWhile listing \"The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs\", Louis Virtel from \"The Backlot\" ranked \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" at number 45, saying that \"its tenderness and power resonated like no Madonna ballad since 'Take a Bow'\". In 2013, Scott Kearnan of Boston.com included it at number 26 on his list of \"30 Ultimate Madonna Singles\"; he wrote that \"Madonna's covered plenty of ground about how women are treated in the world, but she's rarely this unfiltered\". The same year, Edward Cheung from \"PopMatters\" ranked it as the sixth best production by Guy Sigsworth, writing that \"an excellently placed spoken word sample (delivered by Charlotte Gainsbourg) and a keening synth line immediately set the tone for Madge's track as fashionably lonely\". Matthew Jacob's from \"The Huffington Post\" ranked the track at number 51 on his list \"The Definitive Ranking of Madonna Singles\", pointing out its \"meaningful lyrical accomplishment\". While ranking Madonna's singles in honor of her 60th birthday, in August 2018, Jude Rogers from \"The Guardian\" placed the track at number 37 and wrote that \"it sounds like a Saint Etienne song accidentally covered by a superstar\". \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Chuck Arnold called it \"one of Madonna’s artistic peaks\" and her \"most underappreciated\" release; he listed it as her 14th best single. In 2019, Samuel R. Murrian from \"Parade\" ranked it at number 16 on his list of the singer's 100 greatest songs: \"Lyrically barbed but sonically soft, one of Madonna’s most radical tracks explores the brutality of being a woman in a man’s world. [...] Though it was recorded nearly two decades before the #MeToo movement, this track feels like an anthem for it. Madonna was, and is, ahead of her time”.\n\n\"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" debuted at number 73 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart of May 5, 2001, and moved to number 46 the following week, becoming in the biggest leap of that week. The release of the DVD single, CD maxi and 12-inch vinyl prompted the song to debut at number 15 on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart with 6,600 copies (majority being from the DVD single). The song peaked at number 23 on the issue dated May 19, 2001, becoming that week's greatest gainer in sales. The same week, it also reached the top of the Dance Club Songs chart. At the year-end ranking for 2001, the song placed at number 24 on Dance Club Songs. According to Madonna's official website since only a maxi single was released commercially, it hindered the chart placement on \"Billboard\" Hot 100. In Canada, the song debuted at number 14 on the Canadian Singles Chart, and reached a peak of number two after two weeks later.\n\nIn Australia, \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" debuted and peaked at number six on the ARIA Charts, on May 6, 2001, and was present in the top-fifty for nine weeks, and was ranked number 84 on the year-end placements. The track also reached the top of the Australian dance charts. It was certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 35,000 copies of the single. The song debuted at number 50 on the New Zealand Singles Chart, and reached a peak of number 15 after six weeks.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" managed to become the third song from \"Music\" to peak inside the top-ten, reaching number seven on April 28, 2001. According to the Official Charts Company, it has sold 86,771 copies in the country as of August 2008. The song was successful across Europe, reaching the top-ten of the charts in Denmark, Finland, Italy, Netherlands and Spain. However, in some countries, \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" failed to reach the top-twenty. In Austria and Sweden, the song reached numbers 26 and 22, respectively, becoming her lowest-charting single since \"Nothing Really Matters\" (1999) in both countries. In France, the song debuted and peaked at number 40 on the French Singles Chart, and descended rapidly. The track managed to reach the top-ten of the European Hot 100 Singles chart, reaching number eight on May 5, 2001. It was also the most played song on European radios, holding the top position for five weeks.\n\nIn February 2001, English filmmaker Guy Ritchie, Madonna's then husband, said that they were planning to work together on her new music video; \"creatively, we like the same sort of things, so it just makes sense\". One month later, Madonna revealed to Ingrid Sischy that the video would be for \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\", which she found \"ironic because [Ritchie]'s such a macho man, and his movies are so testosterone-driven, but I asked him a long time ago what song on the album he responded to the most, and that's the one\". Filming took place in Los Angeles, including on the Olympic Boulevard. According to Madonna she portrayed a \"nihilistic pissed-off chick\" in the clip, doing things that girls are generally recommended against. The video did not feature the original version of the song but the Above & Beyond remix since the singer \"wanted a matching visual to it and an edgy dance mix\".\n\nThe clip starts with the singer in a motel room getting ready to go out, her hair is straight, chin length and parted down the middle. She then hot-wires a yellow 1978 Chevrolet Camaro from the parking lot, with the license plates reading \"Pussy\" and \"Cat\" on the front and back, before driving to the \"Ol Kuntz Guest Home\" to pick up a semi-catatonic elderly woman. At a traffic light, they stop next to a car with three young men who make lewd gestures at them, which prompts Madonna to spin her car around and collide them. She parks at an ATM, tasers a man and steals his money, and later gives it to a waitress at a burger place. The singer continues to drive in front of a police car and squirts water on the face of two policemen from a fake pistol before driving backwards into their car. She then mows down a pack of street hockey players before stealing a red muscle car from a gas station where an attendant fills its tank, spilling gasoline all over the pavement. Madonna then throws a lighter out of the window causing an explosion, all while still accompanied by the old woman. The final shot depicts her slamming the stolen car head-on into a telephone pole in an apparent act of murder–suicide.\n\nUpon release, the video was criticized for its violent content. Music channels MTV and VH1 said that it would not be added to their regular US rotation and would air it just once, during a news segment, before being completely banned. This was Madonna's third video to be banned by the channel, following \"Justify My Love\" (1990) and \"Erotica\" (1992). \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" aired on March 20, 2001, at 11:30 pm, following an introduction by MTV News anchor Kurt Loder. Liz Rosenberg, Madonna's publicist, released a statement urging the channels \"to make a very strong commitment to playing this video [...] there are many other possibilities that we can explore but our first choice has always been for VH1 and MTV to play [the video], and more than once\". In 2002, the video was aired in its entirety on MTV2 as part of a special countdown of the year's most controversial videos.\n\nThree days later, the clip was shown several times on Oxygen as part of its \"Daily Remix\" music series. A spokeswoman for Oxygen said that the decision to air the video multiple times was because \"our demographic is of 18–49 year old women [...] older than MTV's\". Other channels such as MuchMusic followed and aired the video several times throughout the day and night. Norm Schoenfield, US VP of programming for MuchMusic, released a statement saying \"[the video] is no more or less violent than what kids see on TV everyday. We weren't offended by it, and treating it just like any other Madonna video. Just because MTV isn't playing it, doesn't mean we can't\". Schoenfield also criticized the decision of releasing an advisory warning alongside the video because \"it's the artist's responsibility to do that\". Nonetheless, other Canadian networks aired it only after 9 pm accompanied by a warning. There were also talks of airing the video on HBO but it never happened.\n\nFollowing the controversy with MTV, Warner Bros. Records signed a deal with AOL to air the video online on its music forums. \"Our job as a record company is to get exposure for the video, So when the label couldn't get Viacom to commit to showing the video, it started talking to other outlets\", explained Rosenberg. On April 24, 2001, the video was released as a DVD single with the disc having linear PCM sound quality. It debuted on \"Billboard\"s Top Music Video sales chart at number two with 6,200 copies sold, the highest sum for a DVD single since Madonna's clip for \"Music\", which had sold 4,200 copies in September 2000. The clip was later included on Madonna's 2009 compilation, \"\". Regarding the violent content, Madonna said that her intention was to \"make people ask questions and open dialogues\". Rosenberg explained to \"New York Daily News\" that the clip told the story of a woman who had probably been abused, and called it a \"kind of an anti-violence film. I can't imagine anyone would want to duplicate it\". The apparent suicide at the end had references from Greek mythology, according to Ritchie.\n\nDavid Bianculli from the \"New York Daily News\" felt that \"Madonna has always kept her videos and images at least as fresh as her music. 'What It Feels Like for a Girl', though, is a bad attempt to chase attention by promising controversy\". Similarly, \"Billboard\"s Carla Hay concluded that the video did not live up to its hype. George Lang from \"The Oklahoman\", called it as the singer's worst clip and criticized Ritchie's directing abilities; \"he has great visual sense, but his work often is lacking depth. Both his asset and his debit were in ample evidence in [the video]\". \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Nicholas Fonseca gave the video a rating of C and opined that \"\"Thelma and Louise\" it ain't. In fact, little girls can probably find more empowerment copying Britney Spears' provocative chair dance from her 'Stronger' video\". But he criticized MTV's decision to ban the clip when they aired much more violent videos on the channel. Eden Miller from \"PopMatters\" echoed this sentiment, adding that MTV aired videos such as Eminem's \"Stan\", in which the main character drives his car off a bridge with his pregnant girlfriend tied up in the trunk, or Robbie Williams' \"Rock DJ\", in which the singer strips his skin off in graphic detail. Miller relegated the banning due to Madonna being a woman \"and the idea of a woman taking her aggression out on men is something the network can just not have. That's what is so disturbing. And that really is what it feels like for a girl\".\n\nWriting for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", Neva Chonin accused the video for being a marketing ploy and believed that the singer knew it would result in controversy and drive sales amidst the publicity. Nonetheless, she praised it for being a follow-up to Madonna's aesthetics and changing of her looks from her early career. Chonin realized that by making the violent video, Madonna proved the song's concept further by making a girl behave violently in place of a boy. Louis Virtel from The Backlot ranked it as the singer's 12th greatest video, calling it \"the ultimate (read: solely tolerable) Madonna/Guy Ritchie collaboration [...] She's both chilling and totally confident. It’s her most frightening performance in a music video, and when she plows that car into a group of strangers, her stoic response makes for her greatest video moment of the 2000s\".\n\nAuthor Andrew Morton opined that the video was \"entirely consistent with the themes [Madonna] has been exploring for the last twenty years, namely the relationship between the sexes, the ambiguity of gender, and the unresolved conflict, for women in a patriarchal society of being fully female and sexual while exercising control over their lives\". According to Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors of \"Madonna's Drowned Worlds\", the video represented the female fantasy of behaving like a \"bad boy\" and doing things associated with men. They pointed out the scene in which Madonna winks at three men at a traffic light just before crashing their car, as they felt that on this particular shot she was \"turning the tables of violence back on the men for whom such behavior is considered \"normal\" and putting them on the receiving end of violence, a position usually reserved for women\". They noticed that unlike previous Madonna videos which were banned for religious themes or sexuality, MTV found violence as an offence. Even using the remix in the clip changed the song's feminine and bittersweet nature to something faster and harder, adjectives usually reserved for boys. The authors concluded that as always, Madonna inverted the traditional roles and characterization of male and female in the clip.\n\n\"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" was performed on the promotional concerts for \"Music\" in November 2000 at New York City's Roseland Ballroom and at London's Brixton Academy. On New York, Madonna dedicated the song to singer Britney Spears, while wearing a tank top with Spears' name printed on it. For the London performance, she wore a different top imprinted with the names of son Rocco and daughter Lourdes. Around 3,000 fans attended the concert in London, which was streamed over the internet. More than nine million people watched the concert according to Nicky Price, a representative for Microsoft's MSN, the webcast's producer. It became the most-viewed webcast of all time, beating Paul McCartney's performance of \"50s rock and roll classics\" at Liverpool's The Cavern Club in December 1999, which was viewed by an audience of about three million.\n\nFor the Drowned World Tour of 2001, a remix of the track was used as a video interlude. Dancers wearing anime and manga inspired costumes swung from wires in a Japanese-inspired sequence as the backdrops featured scenes of a naked girl being pursued, trapped and sexually abused. The clips were taken from Satoshi Kon's 1997 film \"Perfect Blue\" interspersed with footage of the hentai anime \"Urotsukidōji\". Writing for MTV News, Rob Mancini opined that the interlude video \"upped the [show's] grim factor further\". On that same tour, Madonna performed the Spanish version of the song, \"Lo Que Siente La Mujer\", atop a rotating black leather podium, dressed in black trousers and a backless black blouse. The female dancers were decked in masculine attires while the male dancers wore long wigs and corsets. Academic Georges Claude Guilbert, author of \"Madonna As Postmodern Myth\", praised the performance for its \"gender-bending and further sense of ambiguity\" while Sal Cinquemani from \"Slant Magazine\" found it to be \"anticlimactic\". The performance on August 26, 2001, at The Palace of Auburn Hills, outside of Madonna's hometown of Detroit was recorded and released in the live video album, \"Drowned World Tour 2001\".\n\nIn 2010, \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" was featured in an episode of American television series \"Glee\", called \"The Power of Madonna\". In the episode it was performed by actors Cory Monteith, Kevin McHale, Chris Colfer, Mark Salling, Harry Shum Jr. and Matthew Morrison. The song was released as digital download to the iTunes Store, and was also included on the soundtrack EP, \"\". It charted at number 125 on the UK Singles Chart. In his review of the soundtrack, Fraser McAlpine from BBC News felt that \"the decision to get all the boys to sing 'What It Feels Like for a Girl' is inspired, and represents a genuinely powerful musical moment that doesn't need the television show's plot to make it fly\".\n\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from liner notes of 12-inch single.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site .\n\nThe underground tombs, many of which date back to the 4th century BC, are carved out of solid rock, and are thought to have been the burial sites of Paphitic aristocrats and high officials up to the third century AD (the name comes from the magnificence of the tombs; no kings were in fact buried here) . Some of the tombs feature Doric columns and frescoed walls . Archaeological excavations are still being carried out at the site. The tombs are cut into the native rock, and at times imitated the houses of the living .\n\nThe tombs have been known and casually explored for centuries . The oldest modern account was written by Richard Pockocke, in 1783 . Almost a century later, in 1870 the first archaeological excavations were conducted by Luigi Palma di Cesnola, the Italian-born American consul to Cyprus. In 1915 the first excavations under scientific supervision took place, led by Menelaos Markides, who was the curator of the Cyprus Museum. Systematic excavations took place in the late 1970s and the 1980s under the direction of Dr Sophocles Hadjisavvas, former Director of Antiquities of the Republic of Cyprus.\n\nDr Hadjisavvas is preparating the finds for publication with assistance from the Australian archaeological mission to Paphos .\n\nPart of the importance of the tombs lies in the Paphian habit of including Rhodian amphorae among the offerings in a burial. Through the manufacturing stamps placed on the handles of these amphorae, it is possible to give them a date and, through them, the other material from the same burial .\n\nThus, it is hoped to develop a more secure chronology for archaeological material in the Eastern Mediterranean of the Hellenistic and early Roman periods .\n\nIt is reported that much of the information related to the tombs was lost over time. Several factors contributed to that: It is believed that many of the tombs were rich in expensive grave goods, despite that very few of such goods were to found by the official archaeological missions, and thus it is believed that grave robbers of the past were responsible. Also, the tombs’ proximity to the sea side hindered the preservation of the buried bodies. Despite those obstacles, the historical significance of the Tombs is well established among experts and locals.\n\n"}
{"id": "2241200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241200", "title": "Divorcing Jack (film)", "text": "Divorcing Jack (film)\n\nDivorcing Jack is a 1998 satirical black comedy. The plot is set around the Northern Irish reporter Dan Starkey who gets entangled in a web of political intrigue and Irish sectarian violence, at the same time as Northern Ireland is set to elect a new Prime Minister. Writer Colin Bateman adapted his own book as the screenplay.\n\nAt the beginning of the film, Northern Irish columnist Dan Starkey (David Thewlis) and American journalist Charles Parker (Richard Gant) are sent out to cover the upcoming elections, in which the charismatic, former victim of the war, Michael Brinn (Robert Lindsay) seems the obvious winner, campaigning on a platform of disarmament and peace between the warring factions in Northern Ireland. Starkey, however, is not impressed with Brinn's promises, believing he has heard it from politicians before.\n\nBefore this, however, Starkey is caught cheating on his wife Patricia (Laine Megaw) with a young art student named Margaret (Laura Fraser). Patricia goes to her parents' house to get some time away, while Starkey keeps seeing Margaret. While at Margaret's, Starkey receives a tape of classic composers from her. He also makes the startling discovery that Margaret's former boyfriend is the feared terrorist Patrick \"Cow Pat\" Keegan (Jason Isaacs). Later, when Starkey returns to Margaret's apartment after having bought pizza, he finds Margaret dying, bloody and molested. Her final words are \"divorce\" and \"Jack\". Starkey then hears the front door open. He runs out to attack the intruder, thinking it is the murderer returning. The result is that he kicks Margaret's mother, who had come by to visit, down the stairs, killing her.\n\nThe next day, Starkey and Parker visit Brinn for an exclusive interview. While at Brinn's residence, it is revealed that Margaret is the daughter of an old friend of Brinn, a man who is also a prominent politician in Brinn's party. Starkey and Parker leave, but are attacked by Protestant paramilitaries on the way. Starkey explains it as a random act of violence, but Parker begins to suspect something is not right.\n\nLater, when Starkey attempts to call Patricia, he hears her being kidnapped on the other end of the line. When the police suspect Starkey for the murder of Margaret and her mother, as well as the kidnapping of Patricia, Starkey is forced to tell the entire story to Parker. Parker reluctantly agrees to help Starkey.\n\nAfter some research, Parker finds out that Margaret had an old friend named Jack, and that this man might be the Jack Margaret talked about as she died. Starkey goes to visit him, only to find that he is a dead end. Starkey also gets himself shot at by paramilitaries that night, but he is saved by Lee Cooper (Rachel Griffiths), a nurse-by-day, stripper-by-night. While Starkey is at Cooper's apartment, she plays a piece of classic music, by the Czech composer Antonín Dvořák (pronounced Dvor-zhack). Starkey realises that Margaret's last words were not \"divorce Jack\", but rather an attempt to say the name of the composer on the tape Starkey had been given earlier, a tape that he had now sold to a street-vendor.\n\nFollowing this, Starkey goes to a restaurant to meet Parker. However, it turns out that Parker has been held hostage by Keegan and his goons, and that the meeting was set up to trap Starkey. Starkey and Parker are taken to a council block Keegan controls, where Keegan threatens to kill Parker unless Starkey hands over the tape. Since Starkey does not have the tape, Keegan kills Parker. Keegan then threatens to kill Starkey's wife Patricia, who had been kidnapped by him earlier, unless Starkey can give him the tape. Starkey then reveals that he had the tape, but that he sold it to a street-vendor. This does not seem to be satisfactory for Keegan, but luckily for Starkey, he and his wife are saved in the last minute by Cooper, who storms in dressed as a nun wearing guns.\n\nStarkey goes to the street-vendor to find the tape, only to find that it has been sold to a priest. Starkey goes to visit the priest, listens to the tape with him, and finds that it is a recording of Brinn admitting to having planted the bombs in the terrorist attack he claims to have been a victim of. Starkey mails the tape to Margaret's apartment, before he is again taken by Keegan's goons. Keegan orders Starkey to take the tape to a valley where Brinn will pay a ransom to have the tape delivered to him. The next morning, Keegan, Brinn, and Starkey meet. Keegan gives Brinn the tape in a tape recorder, while Brinn hands over the money in a briefcase. As the two drive away, Starkey is left to see them both get blown up.

The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00. The cover was designed by Robin McCartney.\n\nThe book features Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. The novel is set at an archaeological excavation in Iraq, and descriptive details derive from the author's visit to the Royal Cemetery at Ur where she met her husband, Sir Max Mallowan, and other British archaeologists. It was adapted for television in 2002.\n\nNurse Amy Leatheran arrives at an archaeological dig near Hassanieh, Iraq, to assist the Swedish-American archaeologist, Dr Eric Leidner, in caring for his wife Louise. During her initial days, Amy learns that Louise was married before to a German named Frederick Bosner. Fifteen years ago, during the Great War, Bosner was arrested for being a spy within the US State Department, and sentenced to death; he escaped his sentence, but died later in a train crash. Louise reveals that Bosner had a younger brother-in-law, and that she received letters from him whenever she became attracted to other men; these stopped when she married Leidner three years ago, until recently. A week later, Louise is found dead in the bedroom of a house near her husband's dig site that the couple are using. She had been struck on the head with a large blunt object, per Dr Giles Reilly's examination of the body.\n\nThe initial investigation by the police, led by Captain Maitland, is unable to find the murder weapon, yet he assumes the murder was committed by someone on the dig. Reilly learns that his friend Hercule Poirot is travelling in Iraq, and so contacts him for help. When Poirot arrives, he notes that the bedroom has only one point of entry, that the only window in the room was shut and barred, and that a rug near a washstand has blood on it. Anne Johnson, a colleague of Leidner, claims she heard a cry, yet is unsure about it. Reilly's daughter Sheila remarks that the victim had the attention of every man, yet no obvious subject emerges from among the team. Poirot takes interest in the story Louise told Nurse Leatheran about her first husband; he wonders if Bosner or his brother-in-law are among the team. Poirot is also intrigued to find that the letters Louise received were in her handwriting.\n\nFollowing Louise's funeral, Nurse Leatheran meets with Miss Johnson on the house's roof, who claims she knows how someone could have entered unseen; she does not elaborate on this further. That night, Miss Johnson unwittingly drinks a glass of hydrochloric acid. It had been substituted for her usual glass of water on her nightstand. Amy comes across her, and hears her mention \"window\" before she dies. The nurse does not believe Miss Johnson has committed suicide, and wonders if she was hinting to how the acid was switched for the water. After spending a day sending telegrams, Poirot brings everyone together and reveals that both women were murdered by Dr Erich Leidner, who is in reality Frederick Bosner. The real Leidner died in the train crash 15 years ago - when Bosner came across his body and found his face disfigured, he switched their identities so as to escape the authorities.\n\nBosner was deeply possessive of Louise. To discourage her from forming relationships with other men, he sent her letters which he carefully wrote out in her handwriting. The letters stopped after he married her twelve years later, when she no longer recognised him. When Louise became attracted to his friend Richard Carey, Bosner decided to murder her to ensure no one else could have her. On the day of the murder, Bosner, on the rooftop, attracted her to the window with a mask he had used to scare her on previous nights. Once she stuck her head out to investigate, he dropped a quern on her, which he then pulled back to the roof via a rope he had tied to it. On the pretence of checking on her, he shut the bedroom window, while moving the body and the rug beneath it to where they were later found. He then used Amy as part of his alibi to divert suspicion from himself. Miss Johnson was murdered because she realised how Louise was killed.\n\nIn the aftermath of his investigations, the police arrest two men at Beyrouth, whom Poirot discovered had been stealing precious artifacts from the dig: Raoul Menier, disguised as Father Lavigny, a well-reputed epigraphist who was not well known by the archaeologists; and Ali Yusuf, a known associate of Menier. Menier was replacing the stolen artifacts with near-perfect copies. Sheila marries David Emmott, while Nurse Leatheran returns to England.\n\n\n\"The Times Literary Supplement\" of 18 July 1936, summarised in its review by Harry Pirie-Gordon the setup of the plot and concluded, \"The plot is ingenious and the first murder very cleverly contrived but some will doubt whether Mrs Leidner, as described, could have been so forgetful and unobservant as to render the principal preliminary conditions of the story possible.\"\n\nIn \"The New York Times Book Review\" (20 September 1936), Kay Irvin wrote: \"Agatha Christie is a past master, as every one knows, in presenting us with a full assortment of clues which we cannot read. And there are mysteries within mysteries among this quiet yet oddly troubled group of scientific workers, one of whom must have been the murderer; it is part of the author's skill to make us feel that every human character is a little mysterious, and that when crimes are committed among a group of apparently well-bred and cultivated people every one of them may be suspect. Agatha Christie's expertness in building up her detective stories, as such, to astonishing (though sometimes very far-fetched) conclusions has more or less over-shadowed her amazing versatility, not only in background and incident, but in character-drawing and actual style. The story here is told by a trained nurse – as has been done by other eminent mystery novelists. Nurse Leatheran holds her own with them all. This latest Christie opus is a smooth, highly original and completely absorbing tale\".\n\nIn \"The Observer\" 12 July 1936 issue, \"Torquemada\" (Edward Powys Mathers) wrote that \"Agatha Christie has a humorous, well-observed story amongst the ruins of Tell Yarimjah, and her latest method of murder, which got me guessing fruitlessly, has, as usual, more simplicity of a miracle than the complication of a conjuring trick. Poirot as a man is quite as delightful as ever, and Poirot as a detective not only perplexes the pleasant and not too intelligent hospital nurse, whose duty it is to tell the story, but, again as usual, the intelligent reader as well. The trouble is that he also perplexes the unprejudiced in a way most unusual to him: I for one cannot understand why he has allowed Agatha Christie to make him party to a crime whose integrity stands or falls by a central situation which, though most ingenious, is next door to impossible. The point at issue, which it would be grossly unfair to specify, between Mrs Christie and the reader is one which would provide a really interesting silly season correspondence.\" He concluded that \"usually Poirot is to be toasted in anything handy, and no heel-taps; this time I drink to him a rather sorrowful glass of Lachryma Christie.\"\n\nThe \"Daily Mirror\" (9 July 1936) wrote: \"Don't start reading this if you've got something to do or want a book just for a quarter of an hour or so. Because you simply won't put it down til you've reached the last sentence.\" The review finished by saying, \"Agatha Christie's grand. In this tale of peculiarly placed murder she's given us another rattling good tale.\"\n\nRobert Barnard remarked that an \"Archaeological dig provides unusual setting, expertly and entertainingly presented. Wife-victim surely based on Katherine Woolley, and very well done. Narrated by nurse, a temporary Hastings-substitute—soon she found she could do without such a figure altogether.\" Barnard was pleased with the main character and that Christie did not use Hastings in the novel, but in summary felt that the novel was \"Marred by an ending which goes beyond the improbable to the inconceivable.\"\n\nChristie reportedly based the character of Louise Leidner on Katharine Woolley, the wife of archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley. Christie's husband Max Mallowan had worked on Woolley's excavation at Ur.\n\n\n\n\"Murder in Mesopotamia\" was adapted as an episode for the series \"Agatha Christie's Poirot\" on 2 June 2002. It starred David Suchet as Hercule Poirot, and was filmed partly on location at the Uthina Archaeological site in Tunisia. While it remained faithful to the main plot elements of the novel, including the murder, the motive, and the denouement, the adaptation made a number of changes:\n\n\nBBC Radio 4 adapted \"Murder in Mesopotamia\" for radio, featuring John Moffatt as Poirot.\n\n\"Murder in Mesopotamia\" was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation on 1 July 2008, adapted by François Rivière and illustrated by \"Chandre\" (). This was translated from the edition first published in France by in 2005 under the title of \"Meurtre en Mésopotamie\".\n\n\nThe book was first serialised in the US in \"The Saturday Evening Post\" in six instalments from 9 November (Volume 208, Number 19) to 14 December 1935 (Volume 208, Number 24) with illustrations by F. R. Gruger.\n\nIn the UK, the novel was serialised as an abridged version in the weekly \"Women's Pictorial\" magazine in eight instalments from 8 February (Volume 31, Number 787) to 28 March 1936 (Volume 31, Number 794) under the title \"No Other Love\". There were no chapter divisions and all of the instalments carried illustrations by Clive Uptton. Several character names were different from the eventual published novel: Amy Leatheran became Amy Seymour while Mr. and Mrs. Leidner were surnamed Trevor.\n\n"}
{"id": "2241234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241234", "title": "Tony Meehan", "text": "Tony Meehan\n\nDaniel Joseph Anthony Meehan (2 March 1943 – 28 November 2005) professionally known as Tony Meehan was a founder member of the British group The Drifters, with Jet Harris, Hank Marvin and Bruce Welch, which would evolve into The Shadows. He played drums on early Cliff Richard and the Shadows hits and on early Shadows instrumentals.\n\nMeehan was professionally nicknamed \"The Baron\" by his many admirers and friends within the British pop/rock music industry. He is reckoned to have influenced many thousands of teenage boys and adolescents to take up music as a career including Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac as a result of his iconic film performance in Cliff Richard's film \"The Young Ones\". \nHis drumming style (cf. \"Bongo Blues\", \"Apache\") is noticeably different from that of other drummers that the Shadows employed during 1958–2010 such as Brian Bennett, Clem Cattini and Trevor Spencer, preferring a simpler 1950s jazz style kit to a voluminous 1970/80s rock/metal drum kit. Thus his kit was significantly more spartan, in terms of quantity of drums and accessories, than Bennett's modern expansive drum kits through the decades. In his contribution to the 1961 book \"The Shadows by Themselves\" Meehan gives advice to all would-be drummers on drum-kit care and maintenance.\nTony Meehan was born to Irish parents at New End Hospital, New End, Hampstead, North West London, England. He was 10 when he became interested in playing drums. By 13, he had his first job with a band playing in a dance hall at Willesden, London. He also played timpani with the London Youth Orchestra. When he was 15, Meehan was set on becoming a lawyer but he was offered a job at £25 per week in a touring show. He was given six months' holiday. The tour never materialised but he did not go back to school. Unlike other members of the Shadows he was never short of work, playing cabaret at Churchill's and the Stork Club. He also played with Jet Harris in \"The Vipers\". \n\nMeehan left the Shadows in October 1961 to work as an arranger/producer and session drummer for Joe Meek (John Leyton, Michael Cox: \"Young Only Once\", Andy Cavell) and from early 1962 at Decca Records. He teamed again with Harris (who had also left the Shadows and moved to Decca) and as a duo had success with the instrumental \"Diamonds\" which also included Jimmy Page on acoustic rhythm guitar. \"Diamonds\" was a number one hit in the UK. Harris and Meehan had two further hit singles together – \"Scarlett O'Hara\" and \"Applejack\".\n\nOn 1 January 1962, the Beatles were auditioned at Decca by Meehan, performing a selection of covers they had performed in various clubs over the years, interspersed with three Lennon–McCartney originals. The Beatles later found out that their manager Brian Epstein had paid Meehan to produce the recordings made that day in order for the Beatles to retain ownership of the tapes. Decca rejected the Beatles choosing the Tremeloes, who auditioned the same day as the Beatles. After talks with Epstein, Decca did arrange for Tony Meehan to produce the Beatles at Decca if the Beatles manager agreed to cover the expenses of about £100. On 7 February 1962, Epstein met Meehan. Meehan expressed condescending comments about the Beatles’ audition with the meeting not going very well and Epstein not impressed with Meehan; Epstein rejected the Decca offer.\n\nMeehan briefly played with the Shadows some years later when Brian Bennett was in hospital. At one point, John Rostill was in hospital at the same time, and the Shadows were playing live with Brian Locking on bass and Meehan on drums.\n\nMeehan quit the music industry in the 1990s for a major career change as a psychologist, as a result of a lifelong hobby/interest. He worked in London at a local college lecturing in psychology until his death. He was a regular churchgoer at his local Roman Catholic church in Maida Vale.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 29 November 2005, BBC News quoted Bruce Welch as saying that Meehan had died the previous day, as a result of head injuries, following a fall down the main staircase at his London flat in Maida Vale. Meehan died at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London.\n\nAt his death, Meehan had been twice married and had seven children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Her grandfather, Edward Riggs, had been a member of the Irish House of Commons, a commissioner of revenue, and a Privy Councillor in Ireland, and Anna inherited much of his wealth. Her father became a commissioner of customs in London in 1741. Horace Walpole described Anna's mother in 1765 as \"an old rough humourist, who passed for a wit\". Fanny Burney characterised her as \"mighty merry and facetious\".\n\nIn 1765 Anna married John Miller, a member of a poor Irish family seated at Ballicasey, County Clare. Miller had served through the Seven Years' War, but resigned his commission at the peace of 1763. Anna brought him a large fortune, and he adopted her maiden surname before his own. At extravagant cost he built a house at Batheaston, near Bath, and laid out a garden, of which Walpole gave a detailed description.\n\nHowever, the expense of the couple's lifestyle soon demanded that they economise and they moved to France and made a tour of the Italian antiquities. In 1776 Anna's lively letters sent to a friend during her travels were published anonymously in three volumes. A second edition, in two volumes, appeared in 1777. The book did enjoy some success but Walpole's opinion was that \"The poor Arcadian patroness does not spell one word of French or Italian right through her three volumes of travel\".\n\nJohn Miller became a baronet in 1778 and Anna became Lady Miller. She instituted a fortnightly literary salon at her villa. Lee characterised the salon as bearing \"some resemblance to the later follies of the Della Cruscans\". In Italy, Lady Miller had purchased an antique vase, dug up at Frascati in 1759. The vase was placed on an \"altar\" decorated with laurel, and each guest was invited to place in the urn an original composition in verse. A committee was appointed to determine the best three productions, and their authors were then crowned by Lady Miller with wreaths of myrtle. The practice was continued until Lady Miller's death. The urn was then purchased by Edwyn Dowding, of Bath, and placed by him in the public park of the town. The society became famous, and was much laughed at. Anthony Morris Storer, writing to George Selwyn, observed, \"Their next subject is upon Trifles and Triflers. ... You may try your hand at an ode, and I do not doubt but you may be crowned with myrtle for your performance\". Walpole, in a letter to Henry Seymour Conway, said, \"I am glad you went [to Bath], especially as you escaped being initiated into Mrs. Miller's follies at Bath-Easton.\" Fanny Burney, while on a visit to Bath in 1780, was introduced to Lady Miller by Hester Thrale, and wrote, \"Nothing here is more tonish than to visit Lady Miller. She is a round, plump, coarse-looking dame of about forty, and while all her aim is to appear an elegant woman of fashion, all her success is to seem an ordinary woman in very common life, with fine clothes on.\"\n\nA selection of the compositions was published in 1775. The edition was sold out within ten days and a new edition appeared in 1776 with a second volume of poems. Walpole called the book \"a bouquet of artificial flowers, and ten degrees duller than a magazine\". A third volume was published in 1777, and a fourth in 1781. The profits of the sale were donated to charity. Among the contributors were the Duchess of Northumberland, who wrote on a buttered muffin, Lord Palmerston, Lord Carlisle, Christopher Anstey, William Mason, David Garrick, Anna Seward, and Lady Miller herself, to whom most of the writers paid extravagant compliments.\n\nSamuel Johnson held the collection in high contempt. Sir Walter Scott believed that Seward's talents were discovered by Lady Miller, and Seward acknowledged her help in her \"Poem to the Memory of Lady Miller\". Besides the works already mentioned, a volume by Lady Miller entitled \"On Novelty, and on Trifles and Triflers\", appeared in 1778.\n\nLady Miller died on 24 June 1781, at the Hot Wells, Bristol, and was buried in the Abbey Church, Bath. On her monument, designed by John Bacon and erected in 1785, there is an epitaph in verse, composed by Seward. She left two children, a son and a daughter.\n\nSir John Riggs Miller, who inherited his wife's fortune, married, after 1786, the widow of Sir Thomas Davenport. He sat in parliament for a time and settling in Bloomsbury Square, he became known in London society as an inveterate gossip and newsmonger, and was a well-known figure in many London clubs. He died suddenly on 28 May 1798, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son by his first marriage, John Edward Augustus Miller (1770–1825)\n\n\n"}

Perched on a high vantage point above Halifax, Clayton and Thornton and overlooking Bradford itself, Queensbury is one of the highest parishes in England, with fine views beyond the West Yorkshire conurbation to the hills of Brontë Country and the Yorkshire Dales to the north and north west. It had a population of 8,718 in 2001 which increased to 16,273 in the 2011 Census.\n\nQueensbury is most famous as being the home of Black Dyke Mills, and the Black Dyke Band.\n\nQueensbury was originally known as Queenshead. That name was derived from a local pub (still existing) which was popular with travellers on the pack horse route from Halifax to Bradford.\n\nThe village was historically divided between the township of Clayton in the parish of Bradford, and the township of Northowram in the parish of Halifax, both in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It became a separate civil parish and urban district in 1894. In 1937 the civil parish was abolished, and the urban district was merged into the new Queensbury and Shelf Urban District. In 1974 the urban district was split, and Queensbury was transferred to the City of Bradford in the new county of West Yorkshire.\n\nQueensbury Ward is a ward in Bradford Metropolitan District in the county of West Yorkshire, England, named after the village of Queensbury around which it is drawn. It includes the villages of Clayton Heights and Horton Bank Top as well as several hamlets: Ambler Thorn, Calder Banks, Catherine Slack, Hazel Hirst, Hunger Hill, Little Moor, Mountain, Old Dolphin, Scarlet Heights, Shibden Head and West Scholes.\n\nThe ward is represented on the council by husband and wife councillors, Paul and Lynda Cromie (The Queensbury Ward Independents), as well as Conservative Party councillor, Andrew Senior.\n\nBlack Dyke Mills was built from 1835 onwards by John Foster as a wool spinning and weaving mill specialising in worsted and mohair fabric, and by 1851 dominated the town. John Foster & Son, the owners of Black Dyke Mills, were responsible for the construction of many of the buildings in and around Queensbury, each being for the benefit of the employees, be it housing/accommodation, shops and leisure facilities. In 1891 the company erected the Victoria Hall in Queensbury for the benefit of its workers and the local community - it had a concert hall, with gallery to seat 650 people, library, billiard room and many other facilities. It also sponsored the internationally famous Black Dyke Mills Band.\n\nThe mill has now been converted into individual business units. The company now manufactures elsewhere in the area.\n\nAs well as being home to the world famous Black Dyke Band, Queensbury is also noted for its strong musical heritage. Home to the world-class rehearsal studio Backfeed, notable musical residents Giles Stocks and Joe Irish of Jon Jones and the Beatnik Movement, pop-punk trio State of Error, and the bands of the Sherry family, including the nationally successful Scarlet Heights (named after the hamlet), The Bad Beat Revue and Ti Amo.\n\nThree railway lines once converged on Queensbury, one from Halifax, Keighley and Bradford each, known as the Queensbury Lines, all belonging to the Great Northern Railway (later the London & North Eastern Railway). Where they met was located Queensbury station, which famously consisted of continuous platforms on all three sides of a triangular junction, an uncommon layout in the United Kingdom (the only other examples were Ambergate, on the Midland Railway in Derbyshire and Earlestown in Lancashire).\n\nA short distance from the station on the Halifax line was Queensbury Tunnel, in length (the second longest on the Great Northern system after Ponsbourne Tunnel in Hertfordshire), while close by on the Bradford line was Clayton Tunnel at . All these lines were closed to passengers in May 1955, later to freight in the 1960s, before finally closing to all traffic in 1972-74.\n\nThe main Bradford to Halifax road A647 road runs through the village as well as the A644 road. These roads intersect at the Albert Memorial. First Calderdale & Huddersfield & First Bradford bus route 576, runs through the village between Bradford and Halifax along the A647 road.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2241254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241254", "title": "OpenEHR", "text": "OpenEHR\n\nopenEHR is an open standard specification in health informatics that describes the management and storage, retrieval and exchange of health data in electronic health records (EHRs). In openEHR, all health data for a person is stored in a \"one lifetime\", vendor-independent, person-centred EHR. The openEHR specifications include an EHR Extract specification but are otherwise not primarily concerned with the exchange of data between EHR-systems as this is the focus of other standards such as EN 13606 and HL7.\n\nThe openEHR specifications are maintained by the openEHR Foundation, a not for profit foundation supporting the open research, development, and implementation of openEHR EHRs. The specifications are based on a combination of 15 years of European and Australian research and development into EHRs and new paradigms, including what has become known as the archetype methodology for specification of content.\n\nThe openEHR specifications include information and service models for the EHR, demographics, clinical workflow and archetypes. They are designed to be the basis of a medico-legally sound, distributed, versioned EHR infrastructure.\n\nThe architecture of the openEHR specifications as a whole consists of the following key elements:\n\n\nThe use of the first two enable the development of 'archetypes' and 'templates', which are formal models of clinical and related content, and constitute a layer of \"de facto\" standards of their own, far more numerous than the base specifications on which they are built. The query language enables queries to be built based on the archetypes, rather than physical database schemata, thus decoupling queries from physical persistence details. The service models define access to key back-end services, including the EHR Service and Demographics Service, while a growing set of lightweight REST-based APIs based on archetype paths are used for application access.\n\nThe openEHR Architecture Overview provides a summary of the architecture and the detailed specifications.\n\nA central part of the openEHR specifications is the set of information models, known in openEHR as 'reference models'. The models constitute the base information models for openEHR systems, and define the invariant semantics of the Electronic Health Record (EHR), EHR Extract, and Demographics model, as well as supporting data types, data structures, identifiers and useful design patterns.\n\nSome of the key classes in the EHR component are the ENTRY classes, whose subtypes include OBSERVATION, EVALUATION, INSTRUCTION, ACTION and ADMIN_ENTRY, as well as the Instruction State Machine, a state machine defining a standard model of the lifecycle of interventions, including medication orders, surgery and other therapies.\n\nA key innovation in the openEHR framework is to leave all specification of clinical information out of the information model (also known as \"reference model\") and instead to provide a powerful means of expressing definitions of the content clinicians and patients need to record that can be directly consumed at runtime by systems built on the Reference Model. This is justified by the need to deal scalably with the generic problem in health of a very large, growing, and ever-changing set of information types.\n\nClinical content is specified in terms of two types of artefact which exist outside the information model. The first, known as \"archetypes\" provides a place to formally define re-usable data point and data group definitions, i.e. content items that will be re-used in numerous contexts. Typical examples include \"systemic arterial blood pressure measurement\" and \"serum sodium\". Many such data points occur in logical groups, e.g. the group of data items to document an allergic reaction, or the analytes in a liver function test result. Some archetypes contain numerous data points, e.g. 50, although a more common number is 10-20. A collection of archetypes can be understood as a \"library\" of re-usable domain content definitions, with each archetype functioning as a \"governance unit\", whose contents are co-designed, reviewed and published.\n\nThe second kind of artefact is known in openEHR as a \"template\", and is used to logically represent a use case-specific data-set, such as the data items making up a patient discharge summary, or a radiology report. A template is constructed by referencing relevant items from a number of archetypes. A template might only require one or two data points or groups from each archetype. In terms of the technical representation, openEHR templates cannot violate the semantics of the archetypes from which they are constructed. Templates are almost always developed for local use by software developers and clinical analysts. Templates are typically defined for GUI screen forms, message definitions and document definitions, and as such, correspond to \"operational\" content definitions.\n\nThe justification for the two layers of models over and above the information model is that if data set definitions consist of pre-defined data points from a library of such definitions, then all recorded data (i.e. instances of templates) will ultimately just be instances of the standard content definitions. This provides a basis for standardised querying to work. Without the archetype \"library\" level, every data set (i.e. chunk of operational content) is uniquely defined and a standard approach to querying is difficult.\n\nAccordingly, openEHR defines a method of querying based on archetypes, known as AQL (Archetype Querying Language).\n\nNotably, openEHR has been used to model shared care plan. The archetypes have been designed to accommodate the concepts of the shared care plan.\n\nWhile individual health records may be vastly different in content, the core information in openEHR data instances always complies to archetypes. The way this works is by creating archetypes which express clinical information in a way that is highly reusable, even universal in some cases.\n\nopenEHR archetypes are expressed in \"Archetype Definition Language\", an openEHR public specification. Two versions are available: ADL 1.4, and ADL 2, a new release with better support for specialisation, redefinition and annotations, among other improvements. The 1.4 release of ADL and its \"object model\" counterpart Archetype Object Model (AOM) are the basis for the CEN and ISO \"Archetype Definition Language\" standard (ISO standard 13606-2).\n\nTemplates have historically been developed in a simple, de facto industry-developed XML format, known as \".oet\", after the file extension. ADL 2 defines a way to express templates seamlessly with archetypes, using extensions of the ADL language.\n\nVarious principles for developing archetypes have been identified. For example, a set of openEHR archetypes needs to be quality managed to conform to a number of axioms such as being mutually exclusive. The archetypes can be managed independently from software implementations and infrastructure, in the hands of clinician groups to ensure they meet the real needs on the ground. Archetypes are designed to allow the specification of clinical knowledge to evolve and develop over time. Challenges in implementation of information designs expressed in openEHR centre on the extent to which actual system constraints are in harmony with the information design.\n\nIn the field of Electronic health records there are a number of existing information models with overlaps in their scope which are difficult to manage, such as between HL7 V3 and SNOMED CT. The openEHR approach faces harmonisation challenges unless used in isolation.\n\nFollowing the openEHR approach, the use of shared and governed archetypes globally would ensure openEHR health data could be consistently manipulated and viewed, regardless of the technical, organisational and cultural context. This approach also means the actual data models used by any EHR are flexible, given that new archetypes may be defined to meet future needs of clinical record keeping. Recently, work in Australia has demonstrated how archetypes and templates may be used to facilitate the use of legacy health record and message data in an openEHR health record system, and output standardised messages and CDA documents.\n\nThe prospect of gaining agreement on design and on forms of governance at the international level remains speculative, with influences ranging from the diverse medico-legal environments to cultural variations, to technical variations such as the extent to which a reference clinical terminology is to be integral.\n\nThe openEHR framework is consistent with the Electronic Health Record Communication Standard (ISO 13606), and the Archetype Object Model 2 (AOM2) has been officially accepted by ISO TC 215 as the draft specification for the 2017 revision of ISO 13606:2.\n\nopenEHR archetypes are being used by the National e-Health Transition Authority of Australia, the UK NHS Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), the Norwegian Nasjonal IKT organisation, and the Slovenian Ministry of Health.\n\nopenEHR has been selected as the basis for the standardised EHR in Brazil.\n\nIt is beginning to be utilised in commercial solutions throughout the world, including those produced by the openEHR Industry Partners.\n\nOne of the outcomes of openEHR modelling approach is the open development of archetypes, templates and terminology subsets to represent health data. Due to the open nature of openEHR, these structures are publicly available to be used and implemented in health information systems. Community users are able to share, discuss and approve these structures in a collaborative repository known as the Clinical Knowledge Manager (CKM). Some currently used openEHR CKMs:\n\n\n"}

He made studies of law, and he later taught history at high schools and universities. In 1938 he established in Santa Fe the Institute of Federalist studies, and made studies of the history of Argentina under a revisionist viewpoint. His view of the past was used to justify critics of contemporary country, and considered that there was an ongoing neglect of national authorities of national interests since the days of the May Revolution. Those viewpoints, as well as the positive image of Juan Manuel de Rosas, were shared by all revisionists, but they were divided by the rise of the peronism. Unlike Julio Irazusta, who became antiperonist, Rosa supported the government of Juan Domingo Perón. His support increased when the \"Revolución Libertadora\" made a coup against Perón, and he joined the Peronist resistance.\n\nSince that point, Rosa started working in the history of the Argentine population, which he saw as potentially revolutionary at times, but always oppressed by the higher classes. He saw Peronism as a revolutionary movement, capable of promoting the delayed changes in society. He supported in 1956 the failed attempt of general Valle against Aramburu. Fearing a political reaction, he moved to Uruguay and then to Spain, returning in 1958. He joined the Juan Manuel de Rosas National Institute of historical investigations, being the president at many times. He was designated ambassador in Paraguay during the third government of Perón, resigning after the deat of the president and moving to Greece. He returned during the National Reorganization Process, but his books were banned and taken out of public libraries. He founded a magazine called \"Línea\" (\"the voice of those who do not have a voice\"), which was censored many times. He died on July 2, 1991.\n\nAt his request, November 20 was declared National Sovereignty Day (\"Día de la Soberanía Nacional\") in commemoration of the 1845 battle of Vuelta de Obligado. His ideas about the history of Argentina had prominent acceptance, and (according to his adherents) they are currently accepted as mainstream.\n\n\n\n"}

As Governor of Bombay, he is best remembered by the Vellard north of Cumballa Hill which was constructed at his behest against the wishes of the British East India Company. One of the first large works of civil engineering in the city, it transformed the geography of the islands by opening up the low-lying marshy areas of Mahalaxmi and Kamathipura for inhabitation on its completion in 1784. He was also the first governor to move his official residence from the Fort area to Parel. In a sense, this was also to change the demographics of the city by starting a northward move.\n\nAn intriguing dead-end of information is the statement attributed to John Murray, that \"The Hornby diamond, brought from the East Indies by the Hon.

{"id": "2241273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241273", "title": "Philosophy and literature", "text": "Philosophy and literature\n\nPhilosophy and literature involves the literary treatment of philosophers and philosophical themes (the literature of philosophy), and the philosophical treatment of issues raised by literature (the philosophy of literature).\n\nStrictly speaking, the philosophy of literature is a branch of aesthetics, the branch of philosophy that deals with the question, \"what is art\"? Much of aesthetic philosophy has traditionally focused on the plastic arts or music, however, at the expense of the verbal arts. In fact, much traditional discussion of aesthetic philosophy seeks to establish criteria of artistic quality that are indifferent to the subject matter being depicted. Since all literary works, almost by definition, contain notional content, aesthetic theories that rely on purely formal qualities tend to overlook literature.\n\nThe very existence of narrative raises philosophical issues. In narrative, a creator can embody, and readers be led to imagine, fictional characters, and even fantastic creatures or technologies. The ability of the human mind to imagine, and even to experience empathy with, these fictional characters is itself revealing about the nature of the human mind. Some fiction can be thought of as a sort of a thought experiment in ethics: it describes fictional characters, their motives, their actions, and the consequences of their actions. It is in this light that some philosophers have chosen various narrative forms to teach their philosophy (\"see below\").\n\nPlato, for instance, believed that literary culture and even the lyrics of popular music had a strong impact on the ethical outlook of its consumers. In \"The Republic\", Plato displays a strong hostility to the contents of the y culture of his period, and proposes a strong censorship of popular literature in his utopia.\n\nMore recently, however, philosophers of various stripes have taken different and less hostile approaches to literature. Since the work of the British Empiricists and Immanuel Kant in the late eighteenth century, Western philosophy has been preoccupied with a fundamental question of epistemology: the question of the relationship between ideas in the human mind and the world existing outside the mind, if in fact such a world exists. In more recent years, these epistemological issues have turned instead to an extended discussion of words and meaning: can language in fact bridge the barrier between minds? This cluster of issues concerning the meaning of language and of \"writings\" sometimes goes by the name of \"the linguistic turn\".\n\nAs such, techniques and tools developed for literary criticism and literary theory rose to greater prominence in Western philosophy of the late twentieth century. Philosophers of various stripes paid more attention to literature than their predecessors did. Some sought to examine the question of whether it was in fact truly possible to communicate using words, whether it was possible for an author's intended meaning to be communicated to a reader. Others sought to use literary works as examples of contemporary culture, and sought to reveal unconscious attitudes they felt present in these works for the purpose of social criticism.\n\nLiterary works also pose issues concerning truth and the philosophy of language. In educated opinion, at least, it is commonly reputed as true that \"Sherlock Holmes lived in London\". (see David Lewis 'Truth in Fiction', American Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 15. No. 1, January 1978) It is also considered true that \"Samuel Pepys lived in London\". Yet Sherlock Holmes never lived anywhere at all; he is a fictional character. Samuel Pepys, contrarily, is judged to have been a real person. Contemporary interest in Holmes and in Pepys share strong similarities; the only reason why anyone knows either of their names is because of an abiding interest in reading about their alleged deeds and words. These two statements would appear to belong to two different orders of truth. Further problems arise concerning the truth value of statements about fictional worlds and characters that can be implied but are nowhere explicitly stated by the sources for our knowledge about them, such as \"Sherlock Holmes had only one head\" or \"Sherlock Holmes never travelled to the moon\".\n\nA number of poets have written poems on philosophical themes, and some important philosophers have expressed their philosophy in verse. The cosmogony of Hesiod and the \"De Rerum Natura\" of Lucretius are important philosophical poems. The genre of epic poetry was also used to teach philosophy. Vyasa narrated the ancient Indian epic \"Mahabharata\" in order to teach Indian philosophy and Hindu philosophy. Homer also presented some philosophical teachings in his \"Odyssey\".\n\nMany of the Eastern philosophers worked out their thought in poetical fashion. Some of the important names include:\n\n\nNotable Western philosophical poets include:\n\n\nSome philosophers have undertaken to write philosophy in the form of fiction, including novels and short stories (see separate article on philosophical fiction). This is apparent early on in the literature of philosophy, where philosophers such as Plato wrote dialogues in which fictional or fictionalized characters discuss philosophical subjects; Socrates frequently appears as a protagonist in Plato's dialogues, and the dialogues are one of the prime sources of knowledge about Socrates' teaching, though at this remove it is sometimes hard to distinguish Socrates' actual positions from Plato's own. Numerous early Christian writers, including Augustine, Boethius, and Peter Abelard produced dialogues; several early modern philosophers, such as George Berkeley and David Hume, wrote occasionally in this genre.\n\nOther philosophers have resorted to narrative to get their teachings across. The classical 12th century Islamic philosopher, Abubacer (Ibn Tufail), wrote a fictional Arabic narrative \"Philosophus Autodidactus\" as a response to al-Ghazali's \"The Incoherence of the Philosophers\", and then the 13th century Islamic theologian-philosopher Ibn al-Nafis also wrote a fictional narrative \"Theologus Autodidactus\" as a response to Abubacer's \"Philosophus Autodidactus\". The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche often articulated his ideas in literary modes, most notably in \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\", a re-imagined account of the teachings of Zoroaster. Marquis de Sade and Ayn Rand wrote novels in which characters served as mouthpieces for philosophical positions, and act in accordance with them in the plot. George Santayana was also a philosopher who wrote novels and poetry; the relationship between Santayana's characters and his beliefs is more complex. The existentialists include among their numbers important French authors who used fiction to convey their philosophical views; these include Jean-Paul Sartre's novel \"Nausea\" and play \"No Exit\", and Albert Camus's \"The Stranger\". Maurice Blanchot's entire fictional production, whose titles include \"The Step Not Beyond\", \"The madness of the Day\", and \"The Writing of Disaster\", among others, constitutes an indispensable corpus for the treatment of the relationship between philosophy and literature. So does Jacques Derrida's \"\".\n\nA number of philosophers have had important influence on literature. Arthur Schopenhauer, largely as a result of his system of aesthetics, is perhaps the most influential recent philosopher in the history of literature; Thomas Hardy's later novels frequently allude to Schopenhauerian themes, particularly in \"Jude the Obscure\". Schopenhauer also had an important influence on Joseph Conrad. Schopenhauer also had a less specific but more widely diffused influence on the Symbolist movement in European literature. Lionel Johnson also refers to Schopenhauer's aesthetics in his essay \"The Cultured Faun\". Jacques Derrida's entire oeuvre has been hugely influential for so-called continental philosophy and the understanding of the role of literature in modernity.\n\nOther works of fiction considered to have philosophical content include:\n\n\nA number of philosophers are still read for the literary merits of their works apart from their philosophical content. The philosophy in the \"Meditations\" of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius is unoriginal Stoicism, but the \"Meditations\" are still read for their literary merit and for the insight they give into the workings of the emperor's mind.\n\nArthur Schopenhauer's philosophy is noted for the quality and readability of its prose, as are some of the works of the British Empiricists, such as Locke and Hume. Søren Kierkegaard's style is frequently regarded as poetic artistry as well as philosophical, especially in \"Fear and Trembling\" and \"Either/Or\". Friedrich Nietzsche's works such as \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" frequently resemble prose poetry and contain imagery and allusion instead of argument.\n\nSocrates appears in a highly fictionalized guise, as a comic figure and the object of mockery, in \"The Clouds\" by Aristophanes. In the play, Socrates appears hanging from a basket, where he delivers oracles such as:\n\nEarly Taoist philosopher Zhuang Zhou expressed his ideas primarily through short literary anecdotes and fables. The other major philosophers of the time appear as characters within these stories, allowing Zhuangzi to playfully explore their ideas and contrast them with his own, as he does with Laozi, Liezi, Hui Shi, and many others. Most prominently in his work is the presence of Confucius and his prominent disciples, who are sometimes used to undermine popular understandings of Confucian philosophy or to reinforce Zhuangzi's own understanding of how one lives in accordance with the Dao.\n\nJorge Luis Borges is perhaps the twentieth century's preeminent author of philosophical fiction. He wrote a short story in which the philosopher Averroes is the chief protagonist, \"Averroes's Search\". Many plot points in his stories accurately paraphrase and epitomize the thought of major philosophers, including George Berkeley, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Bertrand Russell; he also attributes various opinions to figures including George Dalgarno.\n\nA key plot point in Umberto Eco's novel \"The Name of the Rose\" turns on the discovery of a mysterious book that turns out to contain a lost manuscript by Aristotle. Eco's later novel \"Foucault's Pendulum\" became the forerunner of a run of thrillers or detective fiction that toss around learned allusions and the names of historical thinkers; more recent examples include Dan Brown's \"The Da Vinci Code\" and \"The Rule of Four\" by Ian Caldwell and Dustin Thomason.\n\nAlso, Philip K. Dick, who has often been compared to Borges, raises a significant number of philosophical issues in his novels, everything from the problem of solipsism to many questions of perception and reality.\n\nJorge Luis Borges introduces many philosophical themes, and a number of fictional philosophers, in his short stories. A fictional philosophical movement is a part of the premise of his story \"Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\", and the unnamed narrator of his story \"The Library of Babel\" could also be called a fictional philosopher. A fictional theologian is the subject of his story \"Three Versions of Judas\".\n\nFictional philosophers occasionally occur throughout the works of Robert A. Heinlein and Ray Bradbury. Heinlein's \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" contains long passages that could be considered as successors to the fictionalized philosophical dialogues of the ancient world, set within the plot.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2241280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241280", "title": "Veliidae", "text": "Veliidae\n\nVeliidae is a family of gregarious predatory insects in the suborder Heteroptera. They are commonly known as riffle bugs, small water striders, or broad-shouldered water striders because the segment immediately behind the head is wider than the rest of the abdomen. The genus Rhagovelia is also referred to as a ripple bug.\n\nVeliidae have a specialized body plan that allows them to walk on water and are pleuston. Gerridae is another closely related group that is also pleuston and both are in the superfamily Gerroidea. Veliidae are smaller however, between 1.5 and 6 mm. They can be found on ponds, near lake shores, and in rivers worldwide. Some species can also be found on plants near water, in salt water or in mud flats.\n\nJust like all Heteroptera, Veliidae goes through an egg, nymph and adult stage. They have four or five nymphal instars. Both the adults and nymphs live together gregariously, in loose communities and can often be found in large groups. Eggs are usually laid underwater, attached to the stream bed, rocks or plant material and held together by a gelatinous substance. In most species females lay under 30 eggs. Nymphs are very similar to adults, but have one segmented tarsus on mid and hind leg as opposed to the adults' two. Some species prefer rapids or riffles in streams but many prefer calmer water.\n\nVeliidae is the largest gerromorphan family and has almost 1000 species and 60 genera. The present distribution of these species points to two centers of origin: one in the Indo-Malayan region and another on the shores of the Caribbean Sea. The geographical distance between these points is probably due to continental drift. And now they are present across all continents (except Antarctica).\n\nVeliidae are very similar to Gerridae. The most consistent characteristic used to separate these two families are internal genitalia differences, however external cues are usually sufficient to tell the families apart.\n\nA general description is as follows: an oval to elongate body covered with hydrofuge hairs. Wings can be present or absent; when present the wings range from well devolved to vestigial. The four segmented antennae is longer than the head and readily visible. The antennae is non-aristate. The eyes are usually large, but there are no ocelli.\n\nMales and females can be differentiated by the fore tibiae. Males have smaller tibiae with a grasping comb, as opposed to the larger plain female tibiae.\n\nVeliidae can walk on water because they take advantage of the high surface tension of water and have hydrophobic legs that distribute their weight across more water.\n\nAlthough Gerridae typically have longer legs, Veliidae also have legs that spread out the weight over a relatively large area. Thousands of hydrofugal hairs also coat the entire body, mitigating potential problems incurred by water contact: air bubbles, trapped among the tiny hairs if the insect is submerged, lift the insect towards the surface again.\n\n\n"}

Kramskoi was offered a professorship for the painting by the Russian Academy of Arts Council, but having learned that in the beginning of 1873, rejected it (he had been expelled from the Academy earlier, and chose to keep his \"youthful commitment to independence from the Academy\"). Subsequently, it became one of the favourite paintings of Pavel Tretyakov, who bought it for his gallery in the year the painting was finished.\n\nThe theme of Christ's temptation had attracted Kramskoi already in the early 1860s. In that period he made the first sketch of the composition. The first version of \"Christ in the Desert\" is dated to 1867, but turned out to be unsuccessful. Kramskoi realized that the choice of vertical format was inappropriate. He opted for the horizontal format and introduced the pallid rocky desert in the background.\n\nKramskoi described the early history of the painting in his letters to writer Vsevolod Garshin.\n\n\"Christ in the Desert\" is one of Kramskoi's Jesus-themed paintings, the other being \"Rejoice, King of the Jews\" and \"Herodias\". Kramskoy used primarily cold colours to reflect the chill dawn in the background. The thoughtful figure of Christ, wearing a dark wrap and a red tunic underneath, is slightly shifted to the right of centre. Kramskoi wrote: \"To the question 'this is not Christ, how do you know he looked like that?', I permitted myself to reply 'but even the actual, living Christ has not been recognised'.\" The painting emphasizes Jesus's human constituent of hypostatic union and features a mind in struggle instead of action. Because the horizon divides the canvas plane almost in half, the figure of Jesus dominates the painting space and harmonizes with the stern wilderness simultaneously.\n\nKramskoi sold his work to Tretyakov for 6,000 rubles.\n\nThe painting received a wide feedback and appeared at the Peredvizhniks' second exposition of 1873. Pavel Tretyakov wrote: \"I liked Kramskoi's Saviour very much... that's why I was harrying up to purchase him, but many people did not appreciate him much and the others did not at all. In my opinion this is the best painting in our school recently; maybe I am mistaken\". Critic Vladimir Stasov noted that a \"sorrowful note sensibly resounds in the general physiological array of the work\". Vsevolod Garshin outlined the \"expression of immense moral force, hatred against evil and complete resoluteness to fight it\". According to Ivan Goncharov, who wrote \"Christ in the Desert. A Painting of Mr. Kramskoi\" (original Russian title: \"Христос в пустыне». Картина г. Крамского\"), \"the entire figure seems to have diminished a bit from its natural size, contracted, not from starvation, thirst and bad weather, but from internal, inhuman insight to his thought and will during the struggle of forces of spirit and flesh\". He also emphasized that \"there is nothing festive, heroic, victorious — the future fate of the world and of all livings is concealed in that miserable, small being, in pauper appearance, under the rags, in humble simplicity, inseparable with true majesty and force\". The Russian art researcher Georgy Wagner wrote the article \"On the Interpretation of I. N. Kramskoi's Painting \"Christ in the Desert\" (Russian: \"Об истолковании картины И.Н. Крамского \"Христос в пустыне\").\n"}

A fast 3D engine, integrated Internet play, and easy level editing were notable features at the time of its release. While not commercially successful, the game found a cult following. Munkki publicly released the source code in 2016, the game's 20th anniversary.\n\nPlayers operated a remote-controlled bipedal robot known as a Hostile Environment Combat and Tactical Operations Remote, or HECTOR. The unit's characteristics were customizable, ranging in mass from , and stood about tall. Larger models could hold more weaponry, useful in the game's primary mode as a shooter, but were less maneuverable in combat. The name HECTOR represents a thinly-guised tribute to Hector D. Byrd, Ambrosia's mascot, a female grey parrot.\n\nFlying scout units controlled by each player provided an aerial view of the action, but were defenseless and could be destroyed by enemies or other HECTORs. Up to 6 players could join a game at once, either free-for-all, or in arbitrary teams which were chosen by color. Team color choice also affected the in-game HECTOR model's appearance. During games, players could communicate using an integrated text-based chat system.\n\nLevel maps for the engine's fully 3D world could be created using user-friendly, vector-based drawing programs such as ClarisWorks, ClarisDraw, or ShareDraw. \"Avara\" was bundled with some of these level packs, both for solo play and multiplayer modes, and fan-created packs were available for download from Ambrosia's website.\n\nJuri Munkki, the designer, had been interested in 3D graphics ever since the Apple II, but the machine lacked the horsepower to do what he wanted. When Hellcats was released and he saw that fast polygon rendering was possible on Mac. Seeing that it could be done, Juri had another go at writing his own polygon rendering library in late 1992 and this time came up with an early version of what's used in Avara.\n\nThis animation library was strictly 2D. Although he was doing some 3D work at the time, it was just wireframe graphics. He used the polygon library to write a very different kind of sprite animation: the sprites were actually polygons that you could transform (scale, rotate, distort) freely.\n\nIn May 1994, Juri was at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference for the first time. Since it was polygon graphics and the objects were zooming up and down very quickly on the screen, people tended to assume he was doing very fast 3D graphics. He wanted to show the technology to a gaming evangelist and was readying the demos on a PowerBook in the main hall at the San Jose Convention Centre when Stuart Cheshire (the author of Bolo for Macintosh) happened to sit right behind him and see what Juri was doing. Stuart started talking to Juri and said he would really like to see a real 3D version of this technology for use in a 3D version of Bolo. Juri says he thinks he told him that he would keep in touch if anything came from it. He never met the games evangelist - he didn't show up to the meeting.\n\nA bit later Juri corresponded with Christian Fanz who was working on an Elite style game for Macintosh. He was having difficulty getting the 3D graphics fast enough and, remembering his chat with Stuart, Juri took the challenge and had some fun implementing a BSP library.\n\nBoth Stuart and Christian seemed impressed with the demo. Juri made some spaceship models as samples and wrote a few demos to show how the library was used. One of the demos allowed you to drive around scenery. The idea was to verify that the objects were all being sorted into correct visual order. It would be from this experimental stress test that Avara would be born.\n\nFor a long time, Juri had wanted to do a battlezone style game where the turret could move freely, so he thought he would spend a few weeks before Christmas writing a simple networked game/demo where you had tanks with freely moving turrets. He thought it might be fun to let the game evolve by letting other shareware/freeware authors work on it too, so he posted an article about it on comp.sys.mac.games. Andrew Welch saw the article and that's how the game became an Ambrosia title.\n\nThe walking robot was implemented a bit later, but HECTOR didn't have a name until much later and it couldn't jump (just walked). The jumping came a year later, when Juri thought he had the game ready for release, except for the tiny detail of needing a bunch of levels to play with. The idea for a walking and jumping robot slightly predates the engine: Juri had some early sketches of that, in addition to the actual walking animation code from 1992. It just wasn't something he originally intended to be in the game. \n\nAndrew spent a lot of time playing Bolo, so he insisted on having internet play. Juri was pretty much convinced the program architecture and game were not suitable for internet play, but eventually took the challenge in January 1996 and wrote something that \"kinda\" worked on the internet.\n\nEncouraged by this, Juri kept working on the internet code, and got it to a point where he could reasonably play a game from Finland to the USA (modem to modem).\n\nAndrew and Juri managed to get a bunch of reasonably interesting levels together, and then released Avara 1.0.0.\n\nJuri was pretty active in the first week or two when Avara was released, but had to switch to a new ISP (for reasons unrelated to Avara) at about that time. Unfortunately the connections from that ISP were totally inadequate for Avara, so he couldn't play anymore. He has to admit, however, that after two years of playing the game every single day, he was pretty tired of it too.\n\nAvara was a commercial flop. At the time, it was Ambrosia's poorest selling game next to \"Chiral\".\n\nIn 2017, Munkki posted the source to his GitHub account, under the MIT software license. In September 2018, a fan-made port of Avara was posted on GitHub. It claims to run on recent versions of Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.\n\n"}
{"id": "2241312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241312", "title": "Dumb Witness", "text": "Dumb Witness\n\nDumb Witness is a detective fiction novel by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 5 July 1937 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company later in the same year under the title of Poirot Loses a Client. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00.\n\nThe book features the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot and is narrated by his friend Arthur Hastings. One novel published after this one features Hastings as narrator, 1975's \"Curtain: Poirot's Last Case\".\n\nReviews of this novel at publication in 1937 were generally positive, though several pointed out what they considered to be plot weaknesses. The author does \"this sort of thing so superlatively well\", while \"The Times\" in London questioned one of the actions by the murderer: \"who would use hammer and nails and varnish in the middle of the night\" near an open bedroom door? In the \"New York Times\", this novel was not considered Mrs Christie's best, but \"she has produced a much-better-than-average thriller nevertheless\", which is a view shared by \"Torquemada\" (Edward Powys Mathers), who called this \"the least of all the Poirot books\" and then concluded \"Still, better a bad Christie than a good average.\" By contrast, Mary Dell considered this novel to be Mrs Christie at her best. \"The Scotsman\" felt the author deserved \"full marks\" for this novel. A review in 1990 found this novel to be not very interesting, with obvious clues.\n\nEmily Arundell, a wealthy spinster, writes to Hercule Poirot on the belief she has been the victim of attempted murder after a fall in her home in Berkshire. However, her family and household believe she actually fell by accident, after tripping over a ball left by her fox terrier Bob. When Poirot receives the letter, he learns she has already died; her doctor, Dr. Grainger, states her death was from chronic liver problems. A new will she made while recovering from her earlier fall bequeaths her vast fortune and home to her companion, Miss Minnie Lawson. Seeking to investigate Emily's belief someone wanted to murder her, Poirot, accompanied by his friend Arthur Hastings, notes that under her previous will, her nephew Charles Arundell would have inherited, along with her nieces Theresa Arundell and Bella Tanios. All three wish to contest the will, but do not pursue this course of action.\n\nVisiting the house on the pretence of buying it, Poirot discovers a nail covered with varnish at the top of the stairs, deducing a string had been tied to it. Through Emily's last words, he concludes that Bob had been out all night and that she had therefore fallen down the stairs as a result of a tripwire, and that there is a chance Emily was indeed murdered. Her family thus become suspects in that matter. In his investigations, Poirot learns that during a seance held in Emily's home, a luminous aura was noticed coming from her mouth when she spoke. Visiting Lawson at her home, he learns that she saw someone moving about on the night of Emily's fall, who wore a brooch with the initials \"TA\", while Lawson's gardener recalls Charles inquiring about his arsenic-based weed killer and is surprised to find the bottle containing it to be nearly empty. Bella later leaves her husband Jacob, on the implication he bullies her, taking the children with her. After Lawson helps to hide them in a hotel, Poirot moves her to another on fear of a second murder; before he does he gives her a summary of Emily's death. The next day, Bella is found dead from an overdose of a sleeping medication.\n\nPoirot soon brings together Lawson and Emily's surviving family, whereupon he reveals that Bella was the murderer. She had hated her husband, never truly loving him, and sought to separate from him and keep her children in England. As she had no means to do so, she decided to kill Emily in order to inherit her portion of her wealth. When her first attempt with the tripwire failed, she decided to switch one of her aunt's capsules for her liver troubles, with one filled with elemental phosphorus, knowing that her death from the poison would mimic the symptoms of liver failure. The aura witnessed by those attending the seance was because of the poison Emily had unknowingly taken. When she found out her aunt changed her will, and that Poirot had discovered the cause of her death, Bella found herself in far worse quandary. She thus relinquished her children back to their father, before committing suicide; the medication was originally intended to be used in murdering Jacob.\n\nPoirot reveals that Lawson saw Bella on the night of Emily's fall, though in a mirror; the brooch's initials were reversed from that of \"AT\" - Arabella Tanios. The arsenic was stolen by Theresa, who intended to use it, but could not bear to do so in the end. A small sum of cash that went missing was later discovered to have been stolen by Charles; he was aware his aunt had changed her will, before her death. Knowing Emily wished for no scandal, Poirot honours this, while Lawson decides to share her inheritance with Theresa, Charles, and Bella's children. Meanwhile, Poirot and Hastings find themselves returning home with Bob joining them.\n\n\nJohn Davy Hayward in the \"Times Literary Supplement\" (10 July 1937), while approving of Christie's work, commented on some length at what he felt was a central weakness of this book: \"Who, in their senses, one feels, would use hammer and nails and varnish in the middle of the night within a few feet of an open door! – a door, moreover, that was deliberately left open at night for observation! And, incidentally, do ladies wear large brooches on their dressing gowns? .. These are small but tantalising points which it would not be worth raising in the work of a less distinguished writer than Mrs Christie; but they are worth recording, if only as a measure of curiosity and interest with which one approaches her problems and attempts to anticipate their solution.\"\n\nIn \"The New York Times Book Review\" (26 September 1937), Kay Irvin wrote that \"Agatha Christie can be depended upon to tell a good tale. Even when she is not doing her most brilliant work she holds her reader's attention, leads them on from clue to clue, and from error to error, until they come up with a smash against surprise in the end. She is not doing her most brilliant work in \"Poirot Loses A Client\", but she has produced a much-better-than-average thriller nevertheless, and her plot has novelty, as it has sound mechanism, intriguing character types, and ingenuity.\n\nIn \"The Observer\"'s issue of 18 July 1937, \"Torquemada\" (Edward Powys Mathers) said, \"usually after reading a Poirot story the reviewer begins to scheme for space in which to deal with it adequately; but \"Dumb Witness\", the least of all the Poirot books, does not have this effect on me, though my sincere admiration for Agatha Christie is almost notorious. Apart from a certain baldness of plot and crudeness of characterisation on which this author seemed to have outgrown years ago, and apart from the fact that her quite pleasing dog has no testimony to give either way concerning the real as opposed to the attempted murder, her latest book betrays two main defects. In the first place, on receiving a delayed letter from a dead old lady Poirot blindly follows a little grey hunch. In the second place, it is all very well for Hastings not to see the significance of the brooch in the mirror, but for Poirot to miss it for so long is almost an affront to the would-be worshipper. Still, better a bad Christie than a good average.\"\n\n\"The Scotsman\" of 5 July 1937 started off with: \"In Agatha Christie's novel there is a minor question of construction which might be raised.\" The reviewer then went on to outline the set-up of the plot up to the point where Poirot receives Emily Arundell's letter and then said, \"Why should the story not have begun at this point? M. Poirot reconstructs it from here and the reader would probably have got more enjoyment out of it if he had not had a hint of the position already. But the detection is good, and the reader has no ground for complaint, for the real clue is dangled before his eyes several times, and because it seems a normal feature of another phenomenon than poisoning that he tends to ignore it. For this Agatha Christie deserves full marks.\"\n\nE.R. Punshon of \"The Guardian\" began his review column of 13 July 1937 by an overview comparison of the books in question that week (in addition to \"Dumb Witness\", \"I'll be Judge, I'll be Jury\" by Milward Kennedy, \"Hamlet, Revenge!\" by Michael Innes, \"Dancers in Mourning\" by Margery Allingham and \"Careless Corpse\" by C. Daly King) when he said, \"Only Mrs Christie keeps closer to the old tradition, and this time she adds much doggy lore and a terrier so fascinating that even Poirot himself is nearly driven from the centre of the stage.\" In the review proper, he went on to say that the dedication of the novel to Peter was, \"a fact that in this dog-worshipping country is enough of itself to ensure success.\" He observed that Poirot, \"shows all of his usual acumen; Captain Hastings – happily once more at Poirot's side – more than all his usual stupidity, and there is nothing left for the critic but to offer his usual tribute of praise to another of Mrs Christie's successes. She does indeed this sort of thing so superlatively well that one is ungratefully tempted to wish she would do something just a little well different, even if less well.\"\n\nIn the \"Daily Mirror\" (8 July 1937), Mary Dell wrote: \"Once I had started reading, I did not have to rely on Bob or his cleverness to keep me interested. This is Agatha Christie at her best.\" She concluded, \"Here's a book that will keep all thriller fans happy from page one to page three hundred and something.\"\n\nRobert Barnard: \"Not quite vintage for the period: none of the relations of the dead woman is particularly interesting, and the major clue is very obvious. The doggy stuff is rather embarrassing, though done with affection and knowledge. At the end the dog is given to Hastings – or possibly vice versa.\"\n\n\nThe son of Bella and Jacob Tanios is mentioned as Edward and, twice, as John in the novel. The boy is mentioned by name by his mother in Chapters 2, 16, 17 and by his father in Chapters 2 and 17 as well. At any other time, they are mentioned as \"the children\". At the very end of Chapter 16 in one print version, when Bella, her daughter Mary and Poirot are joined by Jacob Tanios and their son, Poirot asks Bella a question and she replies:\n\"\"When do you return to Smyrna, madame?\" \"In a few weeks' time. My husband – ah! here is my husband and John with him.\"\"\n\nAt the start of Chapter 17, Jacob Tanios then calls his son John:\n\"\"Here we are,\" he said, smiling to his wife. \"John has been passionately thrilled by his first ride in the tube. He has always been in buses until today.\"\"\n\nOther print versions have more switches between John and Edward (in Chapter 2 a few sentences apart, for example).\n\nHowever, in the audiobook edition read by Hugh Fraser, the boy is always called Edward, even in those two instances where the print version has the wrong name. Thus they are termed errata. It is not clear when the errata were corrected for the audiobook.\n\nThe book is inconsistent in its references to Bella Tanios' maiden name. There is an early reference to her as Bella Winter (see Chapter 1, page 8 \"For Bella Winter, Emily Arundell's niece, had married a Greek\"). Later she is referred to as Bella Biggs, daughter of Professor Biggs (see Chapter 10, page 74 \"Emily was alone in the world then, and they and Bella Biggs were the only kith and kin she had.\")\n\nAlso in the audio book, the title of Chapter 18 is A Cuckoo in the Nest, changed from A Nigger in the Woodpile, in early texts. That change is more likely attributed to changing values as to accepted language, than considered errata.\n\n\"Dumb Witness\" was based on a short story entitled \"The Incident of the Dog's Ball\". This short story was lost for many years but found by the author's daughter in a crate of her personal effects, in 2004. \"The Incident of the Dog's Ball\" was published in Britain in September 2009 in John Curran's \"Agatha Christie's Secret Notebooks: Fifty Years of Mysteries in the Making\". The short story was also published by \"The Strand Magazine\" in their tenth anniversary issue of the revived magazine in 2009.\n\nPoirot on lying as needed to learn the facts, in conversation with Hastings in Chapter 26:\nH: \"More lies, I suppose?\" \nP: \"You are really very offensive sometimes, Hastings. Anybody would think I enjoyed telling lies.\"\nH: \"I rather think you do. In fact, I'm sure of it.\" \nP: \"It is true that I sometimes compliment myself upon my ingenuity,\" Poirot confessed naively.\n\nIn 1996, the novel was adapted as part of the television series \"Agatha Christie's Poirot\", starring David Suchet as Poirot. The adaptation made a number of notable changes to it, which included the following:\n\nThe cast includes:\n\n\nBBC Radio 4 did a full cast adaptation of the novel in 2006, featuring John Moffatt as Hercule Poirot and Simon Williams as Captain Arthur Hastings.

He served in the Georgia General Assembly, U.S. House of Representatives, and he U.S. Senate before becoming the 32nd Governor of Georgia for two terms and then returning to the U.S. Senate. A believer in expansionist Manifest Destiny policies and a supporter of native Indian removal, Troup was born to planters and supported slavery throughout his career. Later in his life, he was known as \"the Hercules of states' rights.\"\n\nTroup was born during the American Revolution at McIntosh Bluff, on the Tombigbee River in what is now Alabama (then a part of the Province of Georgia). He was the son of George Troup and Catherine McIntosh, the Georgia-born daughter of Captain John McIntosh, a British military officer and the chief of the McIntosh clan. (Catherine McIntosh was of the Chiefs of the MacGillivary clan lineage—she was a first cousin to Creek Chief Alexander McGillivray and aunt of Creek Chief William McIntosh.)\n\nTroup was twice married and the father of six children. He primarily lived in Dublin in Laurens County. Troup's plantation, Valdosta (sometimes spelled Val d'Osta), was named after the Valle d'Aosta alpine valley in Italy. In turn, the town of Valdosta, Georgia was named for Troup's plantation. Troupville, Georgia was also named for him.\n\nTroup graduated from the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University) in 1797. He read the law with an established firm and two years later was admitted to the bar in Savannah, Georgia.\n\nTroup entered politics, where he became a strong opponent of the Yazoo land scandal. A Democratic-Republican, Troup served one term as a state legislator (1803–1805). In 1806 he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, and was re-elected a total of four terms, serving until 1815. Along with fellow western Congressmen such as Henry Clay of Kentucky and John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, Troup was a part of the nationalistic movement which originated the term War Hawks who supported the United States' entry into the War of 1812. Troup defended Calhoun on the House floor when Rep. John Randolph of Roanoke of Virginia attacked Calhoun, Troup said after all, it was \"the great mass of the House ... against the solitary gentleman from Virginia.\"\n\nTroup was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he was supported by fellow wealthy plantation owners and served as chairman of the Senate Committee of Military Affairs.\n\nGeorgia political force William H. Crawford hand-picked Troup as his candidate for governor in 1819. However, Troup twice lost to Crawford's bitter rival, John Clark, who was supported by frontier settlers. In 1823, Troup ran again, as Clark was no longer eligible, and won. He advocated the removal of the Creek Indians from western Georgia. Troup wanted to move them to the Western Territory of the Louisiana Purchase, an idea first proposed by Thomas Jefferson in 1803. In 1825, in Georgia's first popular election, Troup won by a razor-thin margin. He negotiated the controversial Treaty of Indian Springs on February 12, 1825, with his first cousin William McIntosh, a mixed-blood Creek chief. McIntosh and 49 other tribal leaders (predominantly from the Lower Creeks) ceded a large portion of Georgia, although they did not have the backing of the majority of the Creek Confederacy. He threatened an attack on Federal troops if they interfered with the treaty and challenged President John Quincy Adams, who conceded and allowed Troup to seize the remaining Creek land in Georgia. During Troup's tenure as governor, he also supported public education and the construction of new roads and canals.\n\nUpon the expiration of his second term as governor, Troup returned to the Senate in 1829 as a Jacksonian Democrat, where he served on the Committee on Indian Affairs. He was a nominee for President of the United States at the States Rights Convention in January 1852 in Jackson, Mississippi.\n\nTroup died while visiting one of his plantations near the Oconee River in Montgomery County, Georgia (now Treutlen County). He was buried on the Rosemont plantation.\n\nTroup County was created from former Lower Creek land in 1826 and named for him.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, an Athens, Georgia battery was named the \"Troup Artillery\" in his memory.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located at , approximately south of Reading and north of Basingstoke.\n\nAt the 2011 census it had a population of 1,505. This increased to 3,107 at the 2011 Census, mainly due to the Sherfield Park development on the edge of Basingstoke.\n\nIn 2016, Sherfield Park was separated to form a parish of its own.\n\nSherfield on Loddon originally formed part of the Manor of Odiham.\n\nIn the 12th century the manor was granted by Henry II to William Fitz Aldelin, who is reputed to have built the original Manor House.\n\nSherfield was held in the reign of Edward I (1272-1307) by Thomas de Warblington, High Sheriff of Hampshire, tenant-in-chief from the king in serjeanty by the services providing laundresses, of dismembering malefactors and measuring the gallons and bushels in the royal household.\n\nThe manor passed by marriage from the Warblingtons to the Puttenham family. The reputed 1589 author of \"The Arte of English Poesie\", George Puttenham, grew up at Sherfield Court but, as an adult, disputed its ownership with his niece.\n\nThe Manor was eventually purchased by the Duke of Wellington in 1838.\n\nThe present village developed about one mile north of the Manor house and church from around the 14th century. By the start of the twentieth century there were about forty homes surrounding the main village green with more homes around the Manor and Church.\n\nIn 1917 Bramley Camp (Army Training Camp) opened to the southwest of the Village creating employment opportunities for both Sherfield on Loddon and Bramley.\n\nA bypass was built around the village in 1974, moving the main Reading to Basingstoke road to the east.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2014, the Sherfield Park development was built on the edge of Basingstoke within the boundaries of the civil parish. By the time it was completed, the new development's population outnumbered that of the original village. In 2016, Sherfield Park was separated to become a civil parish of its own.\n\nSherfield is located south of the large town of Reading and north of Basingstoke. The village is on the A33 road, between Reading and Basingstoke. The parish includes the hamlets of Church End and Wildmoor.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2241326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241326", "title": "Bishop Allen", "text": "Bishop Allen\n\nBishop Allen is an American indie rock band from Brooklyn, New York, United States. The band's core members are Justin Rice and Christian Rudder, who are supported both on stage and in the studio by a rotating cast of musical collaborators. The band was formed in 2003 and grew out of Rice and Rudder's friendship; it takes its name from Bishop Allen Drive in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where the two lived together after attending Harvard University.\n\nBishop Allen has released four albums and 12 EPs; their second album, \"The Broken String\", was released in July 2007, \"Grrr...\", was released in March 2009, and after a five-year hiatus they released their most recent album \"Lights Out\" in August 2014.\n\nRice and Rudder attended Harvard University, where they were DJs on WHRB's punk/indie program, Record Hospital. The two formed a hardcore punk band called The Pissed Officers and self-released two split records with the then Boston-based Casio-core duo Gerty Farish. Rudder also played briefly in a Devo tribute band with members of Gerty Farish and Fat Day. Some years later Rudder and Rice took up residence at a house in Virginia where they recorded the music for their first album as Bishop Allen.\n\n\"Charm School\" was Bishop Allen's first record. Recorded in fits and starts over two years, it grew song-by-song as Rice and Rudder wrote and played in their spare time. They recorded all the instruments on the album's 13 songs themselves, using drum loops to hide the fact that neither is a drummer, and almost everything on the record was recorded one track at a time in an ordinary bedroom. Backing vocals by Bonnie Schiff-Glenn and Kate Dollenmayer and supplementary drums by Coll Anderson, all added in the album's final stages, completed the songs.\n\nAfter the album was finished, Ms. Schiff-Glenn and Margaret Miller were recruited to play with Bishop Allen live, and their pictures were then featured on \"Charm School\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s back cover. Jack Delamitraux and Christian Owen later joined the band on the tours supporting \"Charm School\"'s release.\n\nThe record came out in May 2003 and received many favorable reviews, most notably from \"Rolling Stone\" and NPR's Weekend Edition. The album was released under the band's own Champagne School imprint.\n\nIn 2006, Bishop Allen recorded and released an EP every month of the year. Each record was titled for the month of its release (\"January\", \"February\", and so on), and, with the exception of \"August\", which was a 14-song live disc, each contained four new studio songs. \n\nThe project began when Rice and Rudder stumbled upon a discarded piano, dragged it into their rehearsal studio and, refreshed by the sounds the keyboard added to their repertoire, put their old works-in-progress aside and began writing new songs. They soon began recording this new material, and by the time the \"January\" EP was completed on January 25, 2006, they had decided on doing one each month for the rest of the year. The January EP begins with the song \"Corazon\", celebrating the rescue of the piano, and features a piano on the cover.\n\nAll 12 EPs were self-released and sold primarily through the band's website. The covers of the EPs, which reflect the homespun aesthetic of the music inside, were designed by Darbie Nowatka, who also sang lead vocal on a few recordings and often joins the band on stage. \n\nBishop Allen collaborated with many musicians over the year, including the above-mentioned Delamitraux and Owens, Jon Natchez, and Kelly Pratt. Cully Symington began playing with the band in September and has become their regular drummer.\n\n\"History of Excuses\" from the \"March\" EP was used in an episode (\"My Turf War\") of NBC's \"Scrubs\".\n\"A Tiny Fold\" from the \"May\" EP was used in the April 28, 2008 episode (MoveOn.Cartwrights) of ABC Family's \"Greek\".\n\nIn November 2006, Bishop Allen signed to Dead Oceans, a new sister label to Secretly Canadian and Jagjaguwar. They began recording a new record that January, at Blackwatch Studios in Norman, Oklahoma, and delivered it two months later. The album, \"Bishop Allen & The Broken String\", was Bishop Allen's first true studio recording and was released by Dead Oceans on July 24, 2007. It includes nine re-recordings of songs from the EP project, as well as three new songs.\n\nIn July 2013, Darbie Nowatka and Justin Rice announced a new Bishop Allen album was underway. Recording finished on December 2nd, 2013 in upstate New York. Dead Ocean and Bishop Allen announced the album's release for August 19th, 2014 and the lead single \"Start Again\" which was released on May 29th, 2014.\n\nJustin and Christian's roommate at the Cambridge apartment that gave the band its name was Andrew Bujalski, the film director, and they have both starred in his films.\n\nChristian played the male lead, Alex, in Bujalski's first film, 2002's \"Funny Ha Ha\", and Justin starred in \"Mutual Appreciation\", in which his character, Allen, fronts a band called the Bumblebees and plays a Bishop Allen song on-screen. Rice also stars in an indie film released in 2008 called \"Let Them Chirp Awhile\", written and directed by Jonathan Blitstein.\nThe band appeared in the 2008 film adaptation of \"Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist\".\n\nJustin Rice and Darbie Nowatka formed a musical side project, The Last Names, in 2011; they are releasing a free cover song every week through 2012 in advance of a full-length album.\n\n\n\n"}

He returned to Ecuador in 1807, and committed himself to freeing his land, first from Spanish rule, and later from the Republic of Gran Colombia.\n\nAfter Ecuadorian independence, Rocafuerte was elected a member of the National Congress for Pichincha Province. He led the opposition to President Juan José Flores, who exiled him to Peru.\n\nRocafuerte returned, and on September 20, 1833, became Governor of Guayas Province. He revolted against Flores, but was defeated and imprisoned. Because of the respect he was held in by his many supporters, Rocafuerte negotiated a settlement with Flores, and was released from prison. The settlement allowed Flóres to finish his term in office, and promised Rocafuerte would become president afterwards, with Flores to head the army.\n\nDuring his presidency, Rocafuerte passed a new constitution in 1835, and gave greater protection to Native Americans in Ecuador.\n\nIn 1839, after Rocafuerte had left office, Flores was again elected president, and for some time there were no difficulties between the two men. However, after electoral irregularities in 1843, Flores annulled the 1835 constitution and passed a new one, called by Rocafuerte 'The Letter of Slavery'. When Flores took up a third term as president in 1843, Rocafuerte left Ecuador in protest. After a short rebellion, Rocafuerte and Vicente Ramón Roca overthrew Flores on March 6, 1845, and Roca became president of Ecuador later that year.\n\nHe was President of the Senate in 1846. Under Vicente Ramón Roca's presidency, Rocafuerte was appointed as special representative to various South American countries. He died on May 16, 1847.\n\n"}

A patriot and poet, he was the son of the Spanish Captain Don Miguel de Olmedo y Troyano and the Guayaquilean Ana Francisca de Maruri y Salavarría.\nOn October 9, 1820, Olmedo and others declared the city of Guayaquil independent from Spain. He was President of the \"Free Province of Guayaquil\" until it was united to \"Gran Colombia\" by Simón Bolívar against Olmedo's will. He was also twice mayor of Guayaquil.\n\nHe was Vice President of Ecuador from 1830 to 1831, and became President of Ecuador from March 6, 1845, to December 8, 1845, surviving an attempted coup on June 18 of that year.\n\nHe was also a noted poet who emphasized patriotic themes. His best-known work is La victoria de Junin, which pictures the Latin American fighters for independence from Spain as the legitimate heirs of the Incas.\n\nOlmedo devoted his life to Guayaquil, he created the Guayaquilean flag and shield, and in 1821 he composed the \"Song to the October Ninth\", which would become the Guayaquil Anthem.\n\nHe is quoted as saying \"He who does not hope to win has already lost.\"\n\nThe José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport in Guayaquil is named after him.\n\nJosé Joaquín de Olmedo was a participant in a group organized by don José de Antepara that supported secession from the Spanish Empire. The group was formed the night of October 1, 1820 in the home of José de Villamil under the guise of a quinceañera for Isabela Morlás, who was the daughter of fellow secessionist Pedro Morlás. Gregorio Escobedo, Francisco de Paula Lavayen, Luis Fernando Vivero, and José Rivas also participated, as well as Venezuelans Febres Cordero, Miguel de Letamendi, and Luis Urdaneta, among others. The group, known as the \"Forge of Vulcan,\" concluded the meeting with an oath of loyalty to the cause by those present.\n\nDuring the days following the meeting, Antepara and Villamil managed to convince the military leaders in charge of Guayaquil’s defense to join the cause of independence. However, they decided to give leadership of the liberationist movement to Olmedo. On October 3, Villamil visited Olmedo to offer him the position of leadership, but Olmedo declined because he thought that the movement should be led by someone with military instead of political experience. Nevertheless, Olmedo confirmed his commitment to the cause and offered to help with political and diplomatic matters once independence was reached.\n\nThe cause of independence, eventually led by León de Febres Cordero, continued in the following days with exhaustive planning of the rebellion that aimed to keep losses and use of weapons to a minimum. Finally, on the night of October 8 the revolution began with the capture of several military outposts by the rebels and the apprehension of authorities loyal to the Spanish crown. The rebellion continued until the morning of October 9.\n\nDuring his life, he dedicated part of his time to the creation of novels, songs, poems, and other kinds of literary works. Among his most well known works are: \"Canto a Bolívar; Al General Flores, vencedor en Miñarica;\" and \"Alfabeto para un niño.\" He designed the flag and crest of Guayaquil and wrote the lyrics of its anthem.\n\nIn 1808 he was inspired to compose the prologue to the tragedy \"El Duque de Viseo de Quintana\" and his poem \"El Árbol,\" which he finished in 1809. \"El Árbol\" contains two parts: one that is philosophical and has great aesthetic sense, and one that is less carefully constructed which ends the poem. This makes it seem as if there were two distinct verses brought together.\n\nIn January 1811 he was still in Mexico and read his poem \"Improntu.\"\n\nIn the beginning of 1817 he traveled to Lima and wrote \"A un amigo, don Gaspar Rico\"...\n\nIn 1821 he wrote \"Canción al 9 de octubre\", considered to be the first anthem of the Ecuadorian territory.\n\nIn 1823 in Lima he edited his 45-page translation from English of \"Essay on Man\" by Alexander Pope.\n\nIn 1825 he composed \"Marcha\" and the poem \"La Libertad.\"\n\nIn 1837 he wrote \"Canción del 10 de agosto\", which served as a precursor to the current national anthem as demonstrated by Espinosa Pólit.\n\nIn 1840 he wrote \"En la muerte de mi hermana.\" In 1843 he edited \"Ocios poéticos del General Flores y una oda en su obsequio\" in 52 pages.\n\nFrom then on his poems began to be published with great success. In 1848 a volume of \"Obras Poéticas,\" a collection revised and corrected by Olmedo, was released in Valparaiso months before his death. The second edition was issued in Paris in 1853, with 214 pages. There are later publications as well.\n\n"}

{"id": "2241370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241370", "title": "Upāsaka and Upāsikā", "text": "Upāsaka and Upāsikā\n\nUpāsaka (masculine) or Upāsikā (feminine) are from the Sanskrit and Pāli words for \"attendant\". This is the title of followers of Buddhism (or, historically, of Gautama Buddha) who are not monks, nuns, or novice monastics in a Buddhist order, and who undertake certain vows. In modern times they have a connotation of dedicated piety that is best suggested by terms such as \"lay devotee\" or \"devout lay follower\".\n\nThe five vows to be held by \"upāsakas\" are referred to as the \"Five Precepts\" (Pāli: \"pañcasīla\"):\n\nIn the Theravada tradition, on Uposatha days, devout lay practitioners may request the \"Eight Precepts\" from monastics (Pali: \"uposathaṃ samādiyati\"). It was a widespread practice in China as well, and is still practiced.\n\nThe eight precepts is a list of precepts that are observed by lay devotees on observance days and festivals. They include general precepts such as refraining from killing, but also more specific ones, such as abstaining from cosmetics. The precepts were probably based on pre-Buddhist brahmanical practices. Since the eight precepts are often upheld on the Buddhist \"uposatha\" days, they are called the \"uposatha vows\" or \"one-day precepts\" in such context. They are considered to support meditation practice, and are often observed when staying in monasteries and temples. In some periods and places, such as in 7th10th-century China, the precepts were widely observed. In modern times, there have been revival movements and important political figures that have observed them continuously.\n\nIn traditional Theravada communities, a non-Buddhist becomes a Buddhist lay disciple by repeating the ancient formulas for the Three Refuges and the Five Precepts in response to the formal administrations of a monk or by himself in himself or in front of a stupa or an image of the Buddha. Newborns of Buddhist parents are traditionally initiated by being brought on their first outing to a temple on a full-moon or festival day where they are presented to the Triple Gem.\n\nIn both the Chinese Ch'an and Japanese Zen traditions, a ceremony of taking refuge in the Triple Gem as well as the receiving of the precepts (受戒 ) is a type of lay ordination.\n\nThe ordination procedures for receiving precepts in the Chinese tradition are laid out in the fourteenth chapter of the Sutra on Upasaka Precepts (優婆塞戒經受戒品第十四).\n\nThe disciple hoping to receive the precepts first pays respects to the six directions, which represent their parents, teacher, husband or wife, friends, religious master and employees (traditionally servants). Honoring the six directions is a \"means fulfilling one's reciprocal responsibilities in each of these relationships\".\n\nA person who has honored these relationships and paid his respects to the six directions must then receive permission from his parents to accept the precepts. If they agree, he informs his spouse and those under his employment. The disciple should then get permission from his king, though for obvious reasons this last procedure is no longer widely observed.\n\nThe disciple, having paid his respects to the six directions and having the relevant permissions, may now ask a monastic to help him receive the precepts. (In modern times, these ceremonies are normally held on a regular basis at temples and presided over by the temple master or his deputy, and one would not ask a random monk or nun to perform the ceremony.)\n\nThe monastic and disciple then engage in a dialog, with the monastic asking questions and the disciple answering. The monastic asks the disciple if he has paid respects to the six directions and if he has the relevant permissions. The monk will ask a series of questions that ensure the practitioner has not committed grave offenses and is both physically and mentally fit to receive the precepts.\n\nThe monastic explains the benefits of the precepts as well as the negative consequences of breaking them, and asks if the disciple is prepared to accept them and remain dedicated to the Triple Gem. Next, the monastic asks the disciple if to follow additional habits to prevent breaking the precepts, to discourage others from breaking them, and to avoid excessive attachment to the five skandhas. If the practitioner is prepared, the monk asks the disciple to practice all the advice for six months while remaining under the monk's regular observation.\n\nIf, after six months, the disciple has upheld the precepts well, he may ask the monastic for formal taking of the precepts. The disciple will then take refuge in the Triple Gem, and the monastic will then ensure the disciple is prepared to take on all (as opposed to only some) of the precepts. If the disciple commits to accepting all the precepts, and recites them with the monk, then he has finished his lay ordination.\n\nThe chapter closes with a description of consequences of breaking the precepts and the obligations that one must take on after receiving the precepts.\n\nTraditionally, in India, \"upāsakas\" wore white robes, representing a level of renunciation between lay people and monastics. For this reason, some traditional texts make reference to \"white-robed lay people\" (\"avadāta-vassana\"). This practice can still be found in contemporary Theravadin temples, especially during the occasion when a non-Buddhist converts to Buddhism or when one is observing the Eight Precepts on an \"uposatha\" day.\n\nIn the Chinese tradition, both upāsakas and upāsikās are permitted to wear robes for temple ceremonies and retreats, as well as home practice. Upāsakas and upāsikās wear long sleeved black robes called \"haiqing\" (海青), symbolic of their refuge in the Triple Jewel. A brown kasaya called a \"manyi\" (缦衣) worn outside the black robes is symbolic of their upholding of the precepts. Unlike monastics, they are not permitted to regularly wear robes outside functions other than temple activities or Buddhist disciplines.\n\nSome Japanese laity can also be seen wearing a \"rakusu\", a short cloth worn around the neck of Zen Buddhist laity. Another form is the \"wagesa\", a short surplice in the form of a strip of brocade fabric worn around the neck, with the temple \"mon\" emblazoned on it. It also acts as a simplified type of kasaya.\n\nIn the Vajrayana tradition, a well known Upasaka is Upasaka Dharmatala who serves as the attendant of the 16 arhats. He is seen to be an emanation of Avalokitesvara.\n\nIn the Pali Canon's \"Jivaka Sutta\", the Buddha is asked, \"Lord, to what extent is one a lay follower (\"upāsako\")?\" The Buddha replies that one takes refuge in the Triple Gem. Asked how one is a \"virtuous lay follower\" (\"upāsako sīlavā\"), the Buddha replies that one undertakes the Five Precepts. Asked how one practices being a lay follower \"both for his own benefit & the benefit of others,\" the Buddha states that one is consummate oneself in and encourages others in the consummation of: conviction (\"saddhā\"); virtue (\"sīla\"); generosity (\"cāga\"); visiting monks; and, hearing, remembering, analyzing, understanding and practicing the Dhamma.\n\n\n\n"}

This version of the process does not guarantee success, even if only 1 option remains since it eliminates possibilities merely as improbable.\n\nThe method of elimination is iterative. One looks at the answers, determines that several answers are unfit, eliminates these, and repeats, until one cannot eliminate any more. This iteration is most effectively applied when there is logical structure between the answers – that is to say, when by eliminating an answer one can eliminate several others. In this case one can find the answers which one cannot eliminate by eliminating any other answers and test them alone – the others are eliminated as a logical consequence. (This is the idea behind optimizations for computerized searches when the input is sorted – as, for instance, in binary search).\n\nIn order for the method to work it is necessary to list all possible, even improbable, possibilities. Any omissions render the method invalid as a logical method.\n\nA process of elimination can be used to reach a diagnosis of exclusion.\nIt is also an underlying method in performing a differential diagnosis.\n\n\n"}

According to German chroniclers, this princess, whose name is not given, was married first to Eric the Victorious of Sweden and then Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark, giving the former a son Olof and the latter sons Harald and Canute. The name retrospectively given her, Świętosława, derives from that of a likely daughter, under the assumption that this girl may have borne the same name as her mother.\n\nThe Icelandic sagas give her role as successive queen of these two monarchs to Sigrid the Haughty, daughter of Skagul Toste. This account is considered less reliable than the contemporary chroniclers by a number of scholars, according to Birgitta Fritz in Svenskt biografiskt lexikon, and the historical authenticity of Sigrid is viewed skeptically. Snorre Sturlasson also mentions a Slavic princess he calls Gunhild of Wenden, daughter of king Burislav of the Wends, the ancient Slavs inhabiting the northern regions of modern Poland, and it has been suggested that Gunhild may be a somewhat confused account of the sister of the Polish king Boleslaw I, described by the chroniclers. Polish genealogist Rafał T. Prinke sees the German chroniclers as having combined the roles of two distinct wives of Sweyn Forkbeard, with the Polish princess actually being Gunhild, mother of Canute, Harold and a daughter Świętosława, while he sees Sigrid the Haughty as an authentic subsequent wife of Sweyn as widow of Eric the Victorious, being mother of Eric's son Olaf and of Sweyn's daughter Estrid. He further suggests that though Świętosława was not the name of Sweyn's Polish wife, the name had a history in the family, that perhaps it was the name of the otherwise unknown wife of Mieszko's father, Siemomysł.\n\nThere is scant material in medieval chronicles to provide details regarding the marriages of Sweyn of Denmark and Eric of Sweden:\n\n\n"}

The magazine (published then in newspaper format) was founded by Charles S. Gage and William G. Peckham in 1866 and, except for a hiatus during the last years of World War II, has published continuously since then. In 1916, \"The New York Times\" published a commemoration of the \"Advocate\"'s fiftieth anniversary. Fifty years after that, Donald Hall wrote in \"The New York Times Book Review\" that \"In the world of the college – where every generation is born, grows old and dies in four years – it is rare for an institution to survive a decade, much less a century. Yet the Harvard Advocate, the venerable undergraduate literary magazine, celebrated its centennial this month.\" Its current offices are a two-story wood-frame house at 21 South Street, near Harvard Square and the University campus.\n\nToday, the \"Harvard Advocate\" publishes quarterly. Its mission is to \"publish the best art, fiction, poetry and prose the Harvard undergraduate community has to offer.\" It also accepts submissions from professional writers and artists beyond the Harvard community.\n\nWhen the \"Advocate\" was founded, it adopted the motto \"Dulce est Periculum\" (Danger is Sweet) which had been used by an earlier Harvard newspaper, the \"Collegian\". The magazine originally avoided controversial topics, lest it be shut down by university authorities; by the time the editors were making the then-radical demand for coeducation at Harvard, the magazine had attracted the support of James Russell Lowell and Oliver Wendell Holmes, and its life was less precarious.\n\nThe founding in 1873 of \"The Harvard Crimson\" newspaper (originally the \"Magenta\"), and in 1876, of the \"Harvard Lampoon\" humor magazine, led the \"Advocate\" by the 1880s to devote itself to essays, fiction, and poetry.\n\nOver the years, the undergraduate editors of and contributors to the \"Advocate\" have gone on to later fame, literary and otherwise. Theodore Roosevelt edited the magazine in 1880. Edwin Arlington Robinson, Wallace Stevens, E. E. Cummings, and T. S. Eliot all published their undergraduate poetry in the \"Advocate.\" Before World War II, undergraduates who worked on the \"Advocate\" included Malcolm Cowley, James Agee, Robert Fitzgerald, Leonard Bernstein, James Laughlin (who got into trouble with local police for publishing a racy story by Henry Miller) and Norman Mailer.\n\nThe \"Advocate\" suspended publication during the years of World War II, and resumed publication with its April 1947 issue. Editors after the war included Daniel Ellsberg. The post-war \"Advocate\" published undergraduate and/or graduate work by Richard Wilbur, Robert Bly, John Ashbery, Donald Hall, Frank O'Hara, John Hawkes, Harold Brodkey, Kenneth Koch and Jonathan Kozol as well as illustrations by Edward Gorey. Contributors from outside Harvard during this time included Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, and Archibald MacLeish.\n\nOther contributors after World War II included Adrienne Rich (the first woman to publish regularly in the magazine), Howard Nemerov, Marianne Moore, Robert Lowell, Tom Wolfe, James Atlas, and Sallie Bingham.\n\nSome recent alumni of note include novelists Louis Begley, Peter Gadol, Lev Grossman, Benjamin Kunkel, and Francine Prose, poets Carl Phillips and Frederick Seidel, biographer and critic Jean Strouse, journalists Elif Batuman and Timothy Noah, literary scholar Peter Brooks, editors Jonathan Galassi and Susan Morrison, businessmen Steve Ballmer and Thomas A. Stewart, filmmaker Terrence Malick, and writer and video game developer Austin Grossman.\n\n\"First Flowering: The Best of the Harvard Advocate, 1866–1976\", an anthology of selections from the magazine edited by Richard Smoley, was published by Addison-Wesley in 1977. In 1986, \"The Harvard Advocate Anniversary Anthology\" was published in conjunction with the 120th year of the magazine's publication and Harvard's 350th anniversary. The anthology reproduced actual pages and artwork published in the magazine, introducing each literary era with a brief historical overview.\n\nThe Advocate received a degree of national press attention following a controversial 2000 interview with writer Dave Eggers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1868: M Williams\n\n1869: M.S.

José Rafael Bustamante was elected the same day as Vice President.\n\nThe president and vice president complemented each other: good judgment and balance were the strong of Arosemena Tola, convictions of freedom and natural talent were the strong of Bustamante. Both imposed the task of fostering openness to the international, adapting the economy to the post-war world situation and combating political cannibalism. The Government of Arosemena Tola was consistent with its bourgeois origin, with the cosmopolitan spirit of the upper class in Guayaquil and with the growing influence of the United States, the great Western winner in the Second War: Arosemena broke relations with the Soviet Union, signed the Charter of the Organization of American States and inaugurated the First Grand Colombian Economic Conference, whose final document, the Charter of Quito, was the antecedent of what would be called the Andean Pact.\n\nArosemena Tola promulgated on March 13, 1948 the Monetary Regime Law, a substitute for the Organic Law of the Central Bank. The new law put the Central Bank under the direction of the Monetary Board that should design the monetary, credit and exchange policy. He arranged for national production to support the currency and that gold reserves serve to determine the international parity of the sucre.

The institute is ranked 1 in India by the National Institutional Ranking Framework ,ranked 1 in South Asia and 231 in the world in the category of Life Sciences and Medicine by QS WUR.\n\nAIIMS (New Delhi) was established in 1956 through an Act of Parliament and operates autonomously under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.AIIMS (New Delhi) is governed by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences Act, 1956. AIIMS was established in New Delhi after then Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's initial proposal to set up the institute in Calcutta was turned down by the then Chief Minister of West Bengal Bidhan Chandra Roy.\n\nInternational Ranking:\n\n\nNational Ranking:\n\n\n\n\nAIIMS New Delhi's main campus is located in Ansari Nagar in Delhi. It is adjacent to the South Extension-II market and lies on the both sides of Sir Aurobindo Marg, southwards to the AIIMS Roundabout flyover crossing.\n\nAIIMS Main campus is spread mainly into 5 locations:\n\n\nAcross AIIMS is Safdarjung Hospital and associated Vardhman Mahavir Medical College (of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University). Also, adjacently lies the headquarters of Indian Council of Medical Research, the body that coordinates and funds medical research in India. In vicinity, also lies National Medical Library, run by the Directorate-General of Health Services of the Government of India. It has a vast collection of scientific and medical journals that can be accessed by researchers.\n\nThe second campus of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS-II), spread over 330 acres (1.335 square kilometres) of land was visualized during the period of Prof. Tirath Das Dogra as Director AIIMS Delhi and Anbumani Ramadoss (President, AIIMS), Minister of Health and Family welfare union of India in 2009 at Badshah village in Haryana's Jhajjar district. \nAIIMS-II was thought to be developed as the largest medical Education centre for super-specialities in the world to meet the enormous need of super-specialists in various field in India.\n. The 330 acres of land was donated by the then Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, of Haryana to Dr.Anbumani Ramadoss, in presence of Director AIIMS Dr.Tirath Das Dogra, in a big Public function on 28th February 2009 at the proposed site .The National Cancer Institute is first to come up, next is the National Cardiovascular centre as a joint venture between Govt of Haryana and Union health ministry in a series of future developments as envisaged The next under the plan is a unique collaborative centre between IITD-Jhajjar campus located adjacent to the AIIMS (New Delhi)'s Jhajjar Extension. They jointly are to set up a \" biomedical research park\", running joint PhD/research programmes managed through the \"Foundation for Innovation and Technology Transfer\" (FITT).\n\nThe 710 bedded National Cancer Institute of India and \"Infectious and Community Diseases Centre\" at AIIMS (New Delhi)'s Jhajjar Extension Campus is constructed at a cost of ₹2,034 crores on 32 acres along the lines of National Cancer Institute of the USA and it is focused on treatment and research on the India-specific cancer.\n\nIt became operational on 18 December 2018 including OPD, lab and 250-bed hospital which will be expanded to 710 beds by December 2019. It is headed by Dr. G.K. Rath former Head of Department of Oncology at AIIMS (New Delhi). National Heart Institute (India) is also being established here.A the heliport is being developed here in January 2019 for the Air Ambulance to serve emergency patients from remote areas.\n\nBallabhgarh, established in 1965, is an extension campus of AIIMS in Ballabhgarh city of Faridabad district in Haryana. This rural field practice OPD campus was set up in collaboration with Government of Haryana as \"Comprehensive Rural Health Services Project\" - \"Ballabgarh Health and Demographic Surveillance System\". In 1961 Rural Field Practice was established at AIIMS (New Delhi) with the help of Rockefeller Foundation. In 1965, the Comprehensive Rural Health Services Project was set up at Ballabgarh with a 50-bed hospital, 24 hr emergency and obstetric facilities, outpatient services in medicine, surgery, pediatrics, gynaecology & obstetrics, eye, otorhinolaryngology, psychiatry, physical medicine & rehabilitation, pediatric surgery, dental care, homeopathy, NCD clinic, ANC clinic, immunization clinic, laboratory, radiological and ultra-sonography services.\n\nAn intensive field practice area, NDDTC -National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre is an extension campus of AIIMS (New Delhi) in Ghaziabad city of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe Drug Dependence Treatment Centre, AIIMS was established in the year 1988 and was functional in New Delhi. In 2003 it was upgraded as a National Centre (National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre) and is fully operational from its new premises in Ghaziabad, Delhi-NCR since April 2003.\n\nNDDTC has been established as the apex centre for treatment of drugs and substance abuse disorders in the country. It provides a state of art model for de‐addiction treatments. This centre has full range of specialists & facilities. The NDDTC is situated on 10 acre beautiful campus. It is presently having 50 bedded treatment facilities\n\nPhD Programme in the area of Addiction Psychiatry & DM (Addiction Psychiatry) Programme started since year 2012 and 2015 respectively.\n\nThe Ex-Chief of the Centre was a member of the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), a monitoring body under the United Nations.\n\nNDDTC has been designated as a WHO Collaborating Centre on Substance Abuse (2012-2020)\n\nIn February 2019 The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister of India has given ‘in principle’ approval to the Implementation of Master Plan to convert All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi into a world class Medical University.\n\nThe visualization at the time of institute's construction \"(in 1950s)\" was for a limited number of patients. The medical institute was established as a tertiary-care centre, but now it has turned into a primary care centre. Over time, the requirement has increased manifold. The upcoming master plan will now have a vision for the next decade.\n\n\nBenefits:\n\nThe project would provide highly specialized state-of-the-art healthcare to the patients and an integrated ‘One Campus’ answer to all the investigative, physiotherapeutic, operative, rehabilitative and vocational needs of the patients.It would ensure smart mobility and accessibility for the patients and become an apex tertiary care centre for advancement of research, clinical applications and management of patients.\n\nBy 2024, AIIMS (New Delhi) will add around 3,000 more beds to its existing strength of 2,478 beds. So there will be a facility of approximately 5,500 beds in service by then.\n\nA move that will come as a relief for thousands of patients who visit the hospital every day as presently the hospital sees a daily footfall of almost 15,000 patients and their attendants. It also aims to strengthen patient-care services and residential facilities for faculty members and staff.\n\nOfficials said the estimated cost of executing the master plan is around ₹10,345 crore, including ₹1,000 crore for hiring manpower .\n\nThe project will be completed in two phases; while Phase 1 will be completed in 46 months, the second phase will be finalized in 70 months.\n\nAs per the plan, a convention centre, a guesthouse with 40 rooms, a hostel with more than 4,500 rooms and 500 residential units with allied car parking will be set up.\n\nAs There is no scope of further expansion with the limited availability of land, residential facilities stretching from Trauma Centre campus, West Campus (Ansari Nagar) to East Campus (Ansari Nagar) and Ayurvigyan Nagar Campus will be relocated. This will free up space in the main campus and allow to expand vertically.\n\nWith senior faculty members raising issues of shortage of labs and operation theaters in the institute, the administration hopes the upcoming project will look into that concern. This new plan will also create scope for research projects, which have been pending due to space constraints.\n\n\nAIIMS (New Delhi) was originally established as a super-specialty tertiary care centre with primary emphasis on research and specialized training facilities. MBBS is the basic medical course at bachelor's degree level. This is followed by master's degree level specialisation in general surgery, general internal medicine, pediatrics and other fields. Superspecialties are those healthcare fields whose practitioners need specialised certification after completing their postgraduation, examples being cardiothoracic and vascular surgery, rheumatology, neurology, and pediatric neurology. There are at least 45 superspecialties at AIIMS (New Delhi) at higher master's degree level. AIIMS also offers M.Sc. and PhD level research courses.\n\nThere are about forty-two specialty post-graduate courses conducted at AIIMS (New Delhi). The entry is through a nationwide competitive examination, AIIMS PG, held every six months. Each year nearly 50 thousand medical graduates and 25 thousand dental graduates across the country compete for the limited number of positions, approximately <1% of the candidates are admitted through the process.\n\nInstitute has a separate Examination-Section of its own, dedicated for all national level entrance exams, university's internal professional exams and departmental exams. Examination-Section functions through a separate website: https://www.aiimsexams.org/ \n\nNational-Level entrance exams for all undergraduate, postgraduate and postdoctoral \"(super-specialty)\" seats in AIIMS (New Delhi) and all other peripheral newly established AIIMS are conducted by this Examination-Section, through Online mode only.\n\nAIIMS publishes \"The National Medical Journal of India\". Several journals in medical sciences are edited by AIIMS faculty.\n\nAs per the latest official notification released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, AIIMS, JIPMER -Puducherry, PGI -Chandigarh & all INIs (Institutes of National Importance) were directed to not to conduct any Undergraduate entrance exams from 2020 onwards.\n\nGovernment has said that from 2020 session onwards, all such undergraduate admissions would be taken up only through a single national level examination NEET-UG conducted by NTA (National Testing Agency).\n\nMany field experts however criticized this exam unification, specifically with respect to AIIMS (New Delhi), citing the reason that the level of questions in AIIMS-UG entrance exams (for both MBBS & BSc Nursing courses separately) used to be of such a higher & deep logical-conceptual thinking capabilities, that they eventually served a greater advantage for selecting the most desirable students for such scientific courses. And that was something really crucial for the main objectives for which AIIMS (New Delhi) was established, which are cutting edge research, medical innovations and to demonstrate high standards of medical education to all medical colleges and allied institutions in India.\n\nAIIMS is a residential university where the faculty members, staff, and students live on either the main campus or one of the several extension campuses. At undergraduate level there is accommodation for total 400 students in 7 hostels, 6 male (Hostels No.1-6) and one female hostel (Hostel 10). At post-graduate level there are 3 hostels, 1 hostel for female students (Hostel No.9) and 2 hostels for single male or married couples (Hostels No.7-8). Additional hostels for nursing students and post-graduate students are available at a facility in the Masjid Moth area, near the main AIIMS campus. Ballabgarh campus has hostels at Ballabgarh, Dayalpur and Chainsa for MBBS, MD, and nursing students deputed there.\n\nAttendance (75%) is compulsory in MBBS and emphasis on participating in research activities, under the professors at AIIMS or elsewhere, from undergraduate years.\n\nClass size at Undergraduate level is small with an intake of only 107 students per year for MBBS course. Seats are reserved category wise as follows: \"(As per the official prospectus of 2019 session)\"\n\n\nAn additional 5% horizontal sub-reservation within each category for PWBD (Persons with Benchmark Disabilities) belonging to the respective categories is also implemented.\n\nEntrance exam is of a totally Online Computer Based Test pattern. Selection is purely on a Merit-basis.\n\nMen constitute nearly 80% of student population. AIIMS (New Delhi) has a cosmopolitan culture with students from allover India as well as from other nations such as Maldives, Malaysia, Indonesia, Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan, Mauritius and more. A variety of Indian cultural festivals and most major international festivals are celebrated.\n\nThe students of AIIMS are known as AIIMSonians.\nThe students are represented by the AIIMS Students' Union, headed by an executive committee that is elected every year from students of 6th semester. Pulse, the annual inter-college festival is hosted by AIIMS (New Delhi), with daily attendance ranging from 15000 to 45000. The students annually host Infest, a scaled down version of Pulse with only internal participation. The students' body frequently hosts literary games, dance classes and arranges coaching for sports.\n\nAIIMS (New Delhi) has large well-equipped gym, swimming pool, tennis courts, basketball, volleyball, squash and soccer. The hostel also have a library.\n\n\n\n\nSubsequently, on many investigations done by Chaturvedi, CBI registered cases and recommended action against Vineet Chawdhry. As per \"India Today\" investigative report of June 2017, J P Nadda, Union Health Minister was found to have hushed up investigation into what the report termed as 7000 crore scam, detailing CBI report and scathing reports of Parliamentary Committee. Opposition parties on basis of this investigative report and documents mentioned in the report, accused Nadda of links with senior IAS officer Vineet Chawdhry who had earlier worked with Nadda in Himachal Pradesh\n\n\n\nFollowing current and former faculty have won the CSIR's Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology for research:\n\n"}

He came from a well-known Guayaquil family; his cousin and his cousin's father had both previously served as president. He went to elementary school at San José de los Hermanos Cristianos School and to high school at Salesiano Cristóbal Colón High School and Vicente Rocafuerte High School in Guayaquil. He graduated from the University of Guayaquil in 1955 with a degree in law. He was already involved in public life during his education: in 1951, he was named a member of the Electoral Tribunal of Guayas. Later, he became president of the tribunal.\n\nBeginning in 1954, his political ascendancy was vertiginous. In 1954, he was elected Deputy for Guayas Province in the National Congress; he was reelected in 1956. In 1957 he was elected Presidents of the Chamber of Deputies, in 1960 he was elected Senator and member of the Monetary Board on behalf of Congress, and in 1961 he was named President of the Monetary Board and Vice President of the Senate. He fought against the military junta that in July 1963 had overthrown his cousin, President Carlos Julio Arosemena Monroy. In 1965, when the country was facing one of its worst political, social, and economic crises—a result of dictatorial misrule—he founded a new political party in Quito called the Democratic Institutionalist Coalition (\"Coalición Institucionalista Demócrata\", CID). One year later, he was elected Deputy of the Constituent Assembly held by \"President\" Yerovi Indaburu. The Constituent Assembly elected Arosemena President of Ecuador on 16 November 1966.\n\nArosemena's ascent to power bolstered the confidence that the country had started to enjoy since the beginning of Yerovi's short administration, so that national and foreign investors brought capital and began important negotiations that led to national development. In an attempt to allay concerns about his being a dangerous leftist (as Velasco's vice president he had expressed warm sympathy for Cuban leader Fidel Castro Ruz and made a much- criticized trip to the Soviet Union), Arosemena named a cabinet that included Liberals and even Conservatives and quickly sent former President Galo Plaza on a goodwill trip to Washington.\n\nAt the time, Ecuadorians believed that the return to a constitutional regime had brought good luck to their country, when in early March 1967 oil began to flow from Lago Agrio Well #1 in northeast Ecuador.\n\nIn this year, Arosemena attended the meeting of Presidents of American states that was held in Punta del Este, Uruguay. At this meeting, he expressed frank opinions with respect to the US policy toward countries of Latin America, and the failure of the Alliance for Progress Program. He was the only attendee who refused to sign the Declaration of American Presidents, because he found it insufficient and lacking in practical content, as was demonstrated years later.\n\nAmong the main achievements of his government was the creation of the Ministry of Public Health, the construction of the National Unity Bridge (today called the Rafael Mendoza Avilés Bridge), the expansion of the Manta seaport, the Ambato-Riobamba and El Empalme-Quevedo highways, the electrification of Manabí and the Santa Elena Peninsula, the restoration of the Quito-Guayaquil railroad, and fostering telecommunications. He also carried out a plan of school building—perhaps his most important accomplishment—that at its height resulted in the construction of 1.7 schools per day.\n\nHis government, though short, greatly increased Ecuador's development and ensured the consolidation of democracy. In accordance with the law, he called presidential elections, and Velasco Ibarra won for his fifth and final time. Arosemena finished his term on 31 August 1968.\n\nArosemena's political adversaries later attacked his policies, particularly with respect to oil policy. He responded by writing the book \"Infamy and Truth\" (\"Infamia y verdad\"), in which he addresses his administration's oil policy.\n\nHe was a professor of history and political geography at various high schools and universities.\n\nHe continued participating in national politics and served as a Deputy or National Representative in Congress until his death from a fall in Salinas in 1984.\n"}

He attended Mejía High School in Quito and the Escuela Superior Naval \"Comandante Rafael Morán Valverde\" and graduated from the Escuela Nacional de Náutica Manuel Belgrano (ESNN). He also attended military academies in Argentina, Brazil, and the United States.\n\nPoveda first served in the Ecuadorian navy where he was promoted as the naval attache at Ecuadorian missions to Western European countries. He became commander of the First Naval Zone and commander of the Marine Infantry Battalion.\n\nPoveda came to power through a military coup in 1976 and was appointed by the Supreme Council of Government as president. He governed with two other members, General Guillermo Durán Arcentales (for the Ecuadorian Army) and General Luis Leoro Franco (for the Ecuadorian Air Force). The triumvirate structured a plan for return to democratic government that led to multiparty general elections after a referendum on a choice of constitutions between a new one created by a constitutional assembly appointed by the Triumvirate and the Constitution of 1948 with several reforms. The new constitution was adopted in 1979 and it was recognized as a progressive document. The referendum lead to multi-party general elections among some twenty recognized political parties and the populist lawyer from Guayaquil Jaime Roldós Aguilera was elected President of Ecuador.\n\nThe military government was known for its crackdown of dissent and was particularly noted for its handling of the October 1977 sugar workers' strike at El Aztra, which resulted to the death of 100 individuals. The regime also withdrew land reform in the same year while all pending land cases were concluded in favor of landowners.\n\nUpon return to a democratic system Admiral Poveda withdrew from public life and took residency in Guayaquil, Ecuador. While returning to Ecuador after a conference in Russia, he died from a myocardial infarction during a layover in Miami, Florida.\n\n\nReferences\n"}

In his short tenure, he became known for his firm stance on human rights.\n\nRoldós was born in Guayaquil on November 5, 1940. He attended high school at the Vicente Rocafuerte National School. He studied law and social sciences at the University of Guayaquil. He was an excellent student and won many awards, medals and scholarships.\n\nAt the age of 37, he ran for president on a populist platform. In the first round, he received the greatest number of votes, but not the 50% plus one needed to avoid a runoff. \n\nIn December 1978, during the nine-month interval between the first and second rounds of the election, an alleged plot to assassinate him, supposedly by eight Americans (who were later charged with archeologic relics trafficking) was reportedly foiled by the military government.\n\nHe won the second round of elections against Sixto Durán Ballén, and assumed office on August 10, 1979 in a ceremony attended by several world dignataries, among them American Secretary of State Cyrus Vance (with First Lady Rosalynn Carter accompanying) and Spanish Prime Minister Adolfo Suárez.\n\nOn October 10, 1979, Roldós signed a decree reducing the workweek to 42 hours. On November 2, 1979, he issued another decree doubling the minimum wage, to 4,000 sucres per month. ($160 in 1979 US dollars). On March 8, 1980, he established the National Development Plan. On April 15, 1980, he established a committee of notables to search for a solution for the power struggle in the National Congress, presided over by his former mentor Assad Bucaram.\n\nHe named 1981 the \"year of advances\". In late January and early February 1981, there were border skirmishes with Peru, in the Cordillera del Cóndor. Clashes occurred in the regions of Paquisha, Mayaycu, and Machinatza. With great skill and diplomacy he left the territorial dispute to the arbitration by the Organization of American States.\n\nRoldós's most important accomplishment was his policy in support of human rights, in an era in which most Latin American countries were military dictatorships. In September 1980, Roldós met with the democratically elected presidents of the Andean region (Venezuela, Colombia, and Peru), proposed the signing of a Charter of Conduct, in which the principles of universal justice and human rights were re-affirmed, signaling protection of human rights as a more important principle than non-intervention. His stance on human-rights led him to clash with fellow Latin American leaders: in one instance at a summit in Colombia, El Salvador’s José Napoleón Duarte (US-backed dictator who came to power with the coup that set off the Salvadoran Civil War) mocked Roldós of being young and inexperienced. Roldós answered: “I may be inexperienced, but my government perches on a mountain of popular votes, while yours is perched on a mountain of corpses.”\n\nThis policy was questioned by American conservatives, who considered it an excuse to justify Soviet meddling in the region, especially in Central America. The United States condemned the \"Roldós doctrine\", as they did that of Panamanian Omar Torrijos, who also died in a plane crash several months later. Following the 1980 U.S. presidential elections appointing Ronald Reagan, bilateral relations with the USA became strained; Roldós declined to attend Reagan's January 1981 inauguration on these grounds. His foreign policy initiatives also attracted the Sandinista government of Nicaragua and with the Frente Democrático in El Salvador, which opposed the military regime in that country.\n\nOn Sunday, May 24, 1981 a Beechcraft Super King Air, carrying the president and an entourage of his to a military ceremony in honor of the fallen in the short war with Peru, crashed into Huairapungo Hill, near the town of Guachanamá, in the Celica Canton of Loja Province. The crash, at 2360 meters over sea level (7800 ft.), left no survivors: killed along with the president were First Lady Martha Bucaram, the Minister of Defense Marco Subía Martinez and his wife, two aide-de-camps, a flight attendant and both pilots. The bodies were reportedly burned beyond recognition.\n\nThe controversy about the cause of the crash began immediately, when the Accident Investigation Committee (\"Junta Investigadora de Accidentes\", JIA) of the Ecuadorian Air Force attributed the crash to navigational pilot error. \n\nA parliamentary commission formed months later, led by then-MP and former President Otto Arosemena, following pressure from the families of the victims and political groups allied with the president, found contradictions and inconsistencies in the JIA report, but could not reach definitive conclusions especially since the aircraft that was purchased by the Air Force to operate as a VIP transport lacked black box equipment. A team of the Zurich Police also conducted an investigation, and concluded that the plane's motors were shut down when the plane crashed into the mountain. This opinion, which contradicted the Air Force Report, was not investigated further by the Ecuadorian government.\n\nA second parliamentary inquiry, led by socialist MP Victor Granda, was formed in 1990 to review the findings of the Arosemena commission and the military investigations. The final 26-volume report, published in August 1992, found several inconsistencies and voids in the initial findings but didn’t establish a definitive conclusion. It criticized the Arosemena commission for its lack of further investigation into the Zurich police findings. Granda has also questioned former President Osvaldo Hurtado (who had succeeded Roldós) for its failure to question or expose the failures of the Ecuadorian Air Force flight security protocols that led to the crash. Specifically, the Granda commission found that in the contracting process of the King Air bought by the Air Force, several high ranking Air Force officers stated that the black box equipment wasn’t acquired with the plane because it was considered “optional” among other spares and equipment (when it should have carried one as it was functioning as presidential transport). The investigation reportedly found that the two additional pages of the acquisition expedient, the ones with the optional equipment list, weren’t rubricated by any officer; so the commission asked the Air Force to demand a certification from Beechcraft to certify if the equipment had indeed been acquired. The Air Force relayed Beechcraft’s response: that they didn’t held any knowledge or registry of having sold or not the black box. According to Granda, this is an element of doubt, as a black box equipment “may have existed”.\n\nThe American author and activist John Perkins, in his book \"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\", asserts that Roldós was assassinated, because his plan to reorganize the hydrocarbon sector would have threatened U.S. interests. The economic relations were strained by Roldos' plan for a new hydrocarbon law not favored by US firms, which reportedly engaged in a lobbying and public relations campaign against Roldós' government amongst Ecuadorean and US politicians, as well as with the religious class; to the point that Roldós accused (without credible evidence) missionaries from the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) of colluding with oil interests, before expelling them from the country. Shortly after sending his legislative package on the oil sector reform, in early 1981, Roldós warned foreign interests that if they wouldn’t contribute to the progress of the Ecuadorian people, they would have to leave the country. Additionally, the aforementioned pact on human rights, reached with Colombia and Peru, was seen by the Reagan administration as a tilt toward the Soviet Union.\n\nJust months after Roldós died, another Latin American leader who had been at odds with U.S. interests in the control of the Panama Canal, Panama's Omar Torrijos, died in what was allegedly just a plane crash, which also is perceived by some to have been a CIA-conducted assassination, again according to Perkins. It is worth noting that Roldós had applauded Jimmy Carter on his stance regarding the return of the Panama Canal after the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.\n\nNiall Ferguson, a historian known for his controversial mostly conservative views, has described Perkins's allegations as implausible. Ferguson notes that that US economic involvement in Ecuador was minimal (less than .5% of foreign aid went to Ecuador, and Ecuador purchased less than .5% of American exports) and inadequate to motivate such drastic action as assassinating a head of state.\n\nThe documentary \"The Death of Jaime Roldós\", which premiered in 2013 explores Roldós' death using interviews, archives and documentary research. It was directed by Manolo Sarmiento, who is close to the Roldós family. According to the film, the Ecuadorian military was heavily sympathetic, if not directly involved, with Operation Condor, the regional repressive apparatus set up by the military dictatorships of the Southern Cone countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay). Consequently, and according to Richelieu Levoyer; who happened to be Commander-in-Chief of the Ecuadorian Army at the time of the crash, Argentinians and Chileans involved themselves in the conspiracy to end Roldós’ regime, as they saw it sympathetic to left-wing causes and governments.\n\nAlmost immediately after the screening, Attorney General Galo Chiriboga announced his decision to reopen the investigation. In April 2015, he announced to the National Assembly that, based on an alleged CIA document declassified in 2014, Ecuador had joined Operation Condor in mid-January 1978. According this document, participation would had occurred through the intelligence services of the Armed Forces; for this purpose, it is alleged (and also reported in the documentary) that “an Argentine general would have visited Quito and installed, in the Ministry of Defense, a telecommunications system (named “Condortel”). The Navy was in charge of telecommunications, while the Air Force was in charge of psychological warfare.” Additionally, an offer by Chile’s Augusto Pinochet to train Ecuadorian personnel at the Military Intelligence School in Santiago would have followed.\n\nIn May 2016, on the 35th anniversary of the crash, Attorney General Chiriboga announced the discovery of several documents, audiovisual and material evidence that was used in the first official inquiry, in an Ecuadorian Air Force depot. Reportedly among the evidence were some small remains of the ill-fated Super King Air. Chiriboga announced that some of that evidence would be sent to Brazil for further analysis; and that he would embark on further investigation, among military installations, to look out for more remains from the aircraft. The Roldós family asked to be kept informed on the new investigation. Chiriboga said that up this discovery collaboration from the Armed Forces had been “cold”, but that “better disposition” now existed. It is worth noting that former Defense Minister Fernando Cordero had declared in 2015 that despite documentation having been declassified in 2013, several files had been incinerated and other documents lost, a fact that his institution would investigate. Cordero added that previous information requests by the Attorney General had been obstructed by missing or disorganized investigation records.\n\nDespite a downturn in his popularity during the last months of his administration, due to the post-war economic measures, Roldos’ death immortalized the last words of his famous speech delivered on the day of his death; at Atahualpa Stadium in front of a crowd of thousands, in which he called for national unity just before departing in his fatidic last journey to Loja, where he was meant to attend another ceremony for the fallen soldiers during the war with Peru:\n\nAfter Roldós's death, his children left the country and the National Congress named Roldós's brother, León Roldós, as Vice President of Ecuador for the remainder of what would have been Jaime Roldós's term. León Roldós was later a candidate for president in 1992, 2002, and 2006. Jaime Roldós's daughter, Martha Roldós Bucaram, was a presidential candidate in the 2009 elections. Jaime Roldós's son, Santiago Roldós Bucaram, is a journalist and playwright. Jaime Roldós's brother-in-law, Abdalá Bucaram, founded the populist Ecuadorian Roldosist Party and was elected president of Ecuador. He governed from August 1996 to February 1997, when he was removed by the National Congress on the grounds of \"mental incapacity\". Martha Roldós has said that the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party has corrupted her father's ideals.\n\nJaime Roldós's most important legacy was his support for human rights. The Roldós Doctrine holds that the international community's concern for a country's internal human rights situation is not a violation of the country's sovereignty.\n"}

He became one of the most widely read political scientists of his home country. In 1977, he authored an influential book on Ecuadorian politics titled \"El Poder Político en el Ecuador\" (English: \"Political Power in Ecuador\").\n\nHurtado drew progressive Catholics and younger professionals away from the Social Christian Party and into the Christian Democrats movement which was inspired by Christian communitarianism and Liberation theology and criticized capitalist exploitation. At the time, it was the most radical among Ecuador's non-Marxist parties and Hurtado was suspected by his right-wing opponents of being a \"closet Marxist\". In 1978, he merged his Christian Democrats with the progressive wing of the Conservative Party to form the Popular Democracy party.\n\nIn 1979, Hurtado was chosen as running mate of presidential candidate Jaime Roldós Aguilera of the populist Concentration of People's Forces.

During his Presidency he sought to introduce market-oriented reforms, and also led a security crackdown on a guerrilla group named ¡Alfaro Vive, Carajo!.\n\nFebres-Cordero was born in a wealthy Guayaquil family on 9 March 1931. His father sent him to study in the United States, where he first attended Charlotte Hall Military Academy in Maryland, then Mercersburg Academy in Pennsylvania for high school, and then graduated as a mechanical engineer from the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, NJ (which he visited after being elected in 1984).\n\nUpon his return to Guayaquil, Febres-Cordero worked in the private sector, mainly in industry, including paper, electrical parts, chemicals and textiles. Eventually he became an executive partner in the Noboa Group, a large agribusiness Ecuadorian conglomerate.\n\nThe Febres Cordero government promoted a conservative economic policy. While some praised Febres-Cordero's economic policies, they became largely unpopular amongst most Ecuadorians. Several of his secretaries were accused of corruption. His Secretary of Finance (and future Vice President), Alberto Dahik, was impeached by Congress.\n\nFebres-Cordero, a close ally of US President Ronald Reagan, was sharply criticized for an increase in human rights violations, including torture and extrajudicial executions. Decades later, Rafael Correa established the so-called Truth Commission to investigate human rights violations, particularly those that occurred during Febres Cordero's administration.\n\nIn January 1987 Febres-Cordero was kidnapped for 11 hours by a group of Air Force members who where demanding freedom for General Frank Vargas Pazzos, who had been imprisoned after leading two uprisings in March 1986, aimed to topple the Secretary of Defense. Congress approved a resolution granting Vargas Pazzos amnesty, but Febres-Cordero refused to sign the resolution, thus denying it the rule of law. It was only after his 1987 kidnapping that he signed the amnesty and released Vargas Pazzos.\n\nFebres-Cordero later became the mayor of Guayaquil for two consecutive terms (1992–1996, and 1996-2000.) His time as mayor is widely considered successful as he lifted the city from years of mismanagement, corruption, and paternalist practices by the populist Bucaram family (particularly the administrations of Abdalá Bucaram and his sister Elsa Bucaram). Febres-Cordero's policies brought order to the government's administration and finances and brought about a massive infrastructure increase, thus cementing a base for his protegé, Jaime Nebot (also from the Social Christian Party). Nebot turned out to be the main political rival of President Correa (2007–2017), establishing a reputation as an important force in the Ecuadorian politics.\n\nIn 2002 Febres-Cordero ran successfully for a seat in Congress, representing his native province, Guayas, for the 2003–2007 term. Despite being a regular absentee due to health issues, he was reelected in 2006, but those same issues forced him to retire shortly before the beginning of the new legislative period early 2007. This symbolically marked the end of his political clout over the country.\n\nFebres-Cordero was first married to former First Lady of Ecuador María Eugenia Cordovez, to whom he had four daughters – María Eugenia, María Fernanda, María Liliana and María Auxiliadora. They divorced in 1988 after thirty-four years of marriage. Later he married Cruz Maria Massu, but they had no children.\n\nFebres-Cordero died aged 77 in Guayaquil, on December 15, 2008, from lung cancer and emphysema. He was granted a state funeral. His remains are buried at the Cementerio Parque de la Paz.\n\n"}

In 1869 he came to America to join two brothers, Frans and Eric. He was accompanied by his parents, a brother August, and a half-sister Anna. They settled in Saunders County, Nebraska, where the family established a home, later known as the Roland Nelson farm, three miles north of Mead.\n\nIn 1875, he united with a little Baptist Church near his home in Estina, Nebraska, and was baptised. He preached his first sermon in that school house where the Baptist Church held its services. The building still stands on a farm property and a marker placed on the spot where the church stood.\n\nHis next years were spent traveling to many countries teaching and preaching. Sensing the need for more training, Franson went to Chicago in 1876 hoping to meet the famous evangelist D.L. Moody. He became a part of the church founded by Moody and was trained by the evangelist as a counselor.\n\nFranson eventually returned to Nebraska to minister to Scandinavian immigrants, but in 1879 he felt led to go to Utah Territory to minister to some 30,000 Swedish immigrants who had gone there for inexpensive land. Franson's evangelistic endeavors were broadened to include members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who had recently settled in Utah Territory.\n\nTwo years later Franson left for his homeland. While carrying on an extensive ministry in Europe, he heard the well-known missionary statesman, Hudson Taylor, challenge people to go to China with the gospel. From that encounter, Franson got a vision to form missionary sending agencies in various European countries, and before he left the continent, six such organizations had come into being: Danish Mission Confederation, Swiss Alliance Mission, German Alliance Mission, Finnish Alliance Mission, Swedish Evangelical Mission in Japan, and Swedish Alliance Mission. All six agencies continue to send out missionaries to this day.\n\nAfter arriving back in America, Franson continued to preach. His desire to motivate others for cross-cultural missions led him to form a training class in Brooklyn, New York. In 1890 he founded the Scandinavian Alliance Mission in Chicago, later known as The Evangelical Alliance Mission, also several missions in Sweden.\n\nHis first class on October 14, 1890, is recognized as the \"birthday\" of TEAM, although the early name for the agency was \"The Scandinavian Alliance Mission.\" This name reflected Franson's vision to bring churches together into an alliance enabling even small congregations to have a part in sending out missionaries. Classes were also initiated in Chicago, Minneapolis and Omaha. Soon a formal board of directors came into being, and on January 17, 1891, the first band of 35 missionaries boarded a train for the West Coast and eventually China.\n\nPhotographs of these early missionaries depict a dedicated group of people who chose to live and dress as the Chinese did. Other groups soon joined the first recruits, and Franson fervently challenged still more to go. In order to get to China, the early missionaries had to pass through Japan, and that soon became a new field for the mission. In a similar manner, by 1892, a small group also went to Swaziland. In 1906 T.J. Bach and his wife left for Venezuela. Bach would later become TEAM's third General Director. In 1908, following one of his lengthy trips to the fields, Franson took several days off to rest at the home of some friends in Idaho Springs, Colorado. One morning his host tried to wake him for breakfast, but he had died during the night.\n\nFredrik Franson died August 2, 1908, in Idaho Springs, Colorado, where he had gone for some much needed rest. His age was 56. Services were held at the Presbyterian Church in Colon, Nebraska and burial was in Estina Cemetery, south of Leshara. His body was later moved to Chicago into the Franson Memorial Building.\n\nThe Mission which Franson founded with 1 field and 50 missionaries has grown under the guidance and blessings of God until today has well over 1000 missionaries in over 20 fields.\n\nHis motto was \"Forward 'Till Upward.\"\n\nTwo great-nephews remain in this area to keep his memory alive, Wallace Anderson, Colon, Nebraska and Robert Franson, Springfield, Missouri.\n\nFranson left behind no family or estate. His legacy was a group of dedicated people whose desire was to take the gospel to all people. Franson's two passions-evangelism and church planting-continue to be the focus of TEAM's worldwide ministry.\n\n\n\n"}

The defeated candidate Álvaro Noboa asked for a vote recount, which was denied by the authority responsible. There was a severe economic crisis in Ecuador (including the 1998–99 Ecuador banking crisis), which had led to a 60% cut in the armed forces budget. Mahuad's popularity rating had fallen from 60% in October 1998 to 6% in January 2000.

Before his election as president, he served as Mayor of Quito from 1992 to 1998.\n\nHe proposed economic reforms that produced the \"dollarization\" of the economy. He declared a freeze in bank accounts in order to control rampant inflation. This caused massive unrest as the lower classes struggled to convert their now useless Ecuadorian sucres to US dollars and lost wealth, while the upper classes (whose members already had their wealth invested in US dollars) gained wealth in turn.

The Act allowed magistrates to send disorderly children to a residential industrial school. An 1876 Act led to nonresidential day schools of a similar kind.\n\nThere were similar arrangements in Scotland, where the Industrial Schools Act came into force in 1866. The schools cared for neglected children and taught them a trade, with an emphasis on preventing crime. Glasgow Industrial School for Girls is an example formed in 1882.\nThey were distinct from reformatories set up under the 1854 Youthful Offenders Act (the Reformatory Schools Act) which included an element of punishment. Both agreed in 1927 to call themselves approved schools. \n\nIn Ireland, the Industrial Schools Act of 1868 established industrial schools () to care for \"neglected, orphaned and abandoned children\". By 1884 there were 5,049 children in such institutions.\n\nAn Industrial Feeding School was opened in Aberdeen in 1846. Industrial schools, like the contemporaneous ragged schools, were set up by volunteers to help destitute children. Their philosophy differed in that they believed that an education was not enough: these children needed to be removed from the harmful environment of the street, trained to be industrious, and given a trade they could practise.\nSome schools were residential, but other children were day-boys. The regime was severe, with a tightly-timetabled daily routine that stretched from waking at 6:00am to bedtime at 7:00pm.\n\nDuring the day there were set times for religion and moral guidance, formal schooling, doing housework, eating, and learning trades, with three intervals for play. The boys' trades were gardening, tailoring, and shoemaking; the girls learned housework and washing, knitting, and sewing.\n\nThe Industrial Schools Act 1857 gave magistrates the power to sentence homeless children between the ages of 7 and 14, who were brought before the courts for vagrancy to a spell in an industrial school.\n\nIn 1861, a further act strengthened the powers of the magistrate \"to include:\n\n\nIt was not until 1875 that it became compulsory to register births, and vagrants often genuinely did not know their age. Also, children would say any age that was convenient to them at the time.\n\nHomeless children who had not committed any more serious crime were sent to industrial schools, and children who had been arrested for other crimes were sent to juvenile prisons known as reformatories.\n\nThe intention was that the cost of attending such a school would be met by the parents, which was an interesting concept for a child who was sent there because he was already homeless. The state had to provide. The system expanded rapidly, and magistrates preferred to send miscreants to a school rather than a reformatory. There was public unrest about the mounting cost. From 1870, responsibility for the Industrial schools passed to the local Committee of Education.\n\nBest estimates suggest that, at the peak, there were 224 certified industrial schools in England and 50 in Scotland. There were others operating without certification or when certification had been removed. Name changing was common. Directly after World War I, one hundred closed and by 1933 there were only 55 remaining. They agreed to change their names to approved schools in 1927, and the Approved Schools Act of 1933 merged them to form a single system.\n\n\n\n"}

The NWS, a government agency operating as an arm of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) branch of the United States Department of Commerce (DoC), defines precise meanings for nearly all of its weather terms.\n\nThis article describes NWS terminology and related weather scales used by the agency. Some terms may be specific to certain cities or regions. Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) product codes assigned to each term for NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) broadcasts are included in parentheses following the title of the described alert type if used; products that do not have a specified code are identified where applicable as Non-Precipitation Warnings/Watches/Advisories (NPW), Coastal Flood Warnings/Watches/Advisories (CFW), Marine Weather Statement (MWS), Surf Discussion (SRD) or Winter Weather Warnings/Watches/Advisories (WSW) as defined by NOAA.\n\nThe NWS divides severe weather alerts into several types of hazardous/hydrologic events:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"See also Windchill section below.\"\n\n\nThe following advisories are issued by the National Weather Service Aviation Weather Center (outside of Alaska) or Alaska Aviation Weather Unit. Atmospheric ash plume advisories/warnings are also issued by the United States Geological Survey (Aviation Color Codes).\n\n\n\nThe National Weather Service also relays messages for non-weather related hazardous events in text products and NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts:\n\nWind alerting is classified into groups of two Beaufort numbers, beginning at 6–7 for the lowest class of wind advisories. The last group includes three Beaufort numbers, 14–16. The actual alerts can be categorized into three classes: maritime wind warnings, land wind warnings, and tropical cyclone warnings. Advisory-force and gale-force winds will not trigger a separate wind advisory or warning if a Blizzard warning is already in effect. However, as seen with Hurricane Sandy, if widespread high wind warnings are in effect prior to the issuance of a blizzard warning, the high wind warnings may be continued.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> <br>\n† <br>\n\nThe various weather conditions described above have different levels of risk. The National Weather Service uses a multi-tier system of weather statements to notify the public of threatening weather conditions. These statements are used in conjunction with specific weather phenomena to convey different levels of risk. In order of increasing risk, these statements are:\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issues Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3 Convective Outlooks depicting forecast areas of general (non-severe) and severe thunderstorm threats across the contiguous United States, along with a text narrative discussion consisting of a plain-language summary of the threat type(s) and timing focused on areas of highest risk, and a technical discussion written in scientific language that usually includes a synoptic overview of convective patterns as well as, if necessary, a geographically specific narrative of meteorological reasoning and justification for the type of coverage and intensity applicable to the severe thunderstorm threat.\n\nThe categorical forecast in the Day 1-3 Convective Outlooks—which estimates a severe weather event occurring within of a point and derives the attendant risk areas from probability forecasts of tornadoes, damaging winds, and large hail on Day 1, and a combined severe weather risk on Days 2 and 3—specifies the level of overall severe thunderstorm risk via numbers, descriptive labeling, and colors as follows: (The Day 4-8 Convective Outlook assesses the percentile probability of severe thunderstorm activity during that period at the 15% and 30% likelihood.)\n\nMany of the National Weather Service's Weather Forecast Offices—primarily those located within the Central and Southern Region Headquarters—use a multi-tier Impact-Based Warning (IBW) system of impact statements to notify the public and emergency management officials of the severity of specific severe weather phenomena. The impact statement system—initially used only for tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings—was first employed by the WFOs in Wichita and Topeka, Kansas, and Springfield, St. Louis and Kansas City/Pleasant Hill, Missouri beginning with the 2012 Spring severe weather season, eventually expanded to include 33 additional National Weather Service Weather Forecast Offices within the Central Region Headquarters in 2013, and then to eight additional offices within the Eastern, Southern and Western Regions in the spring of 2014.\n\nUnder this system, the warning product will include text denoting the specific hazard (i.e., 60 mph wind gusts and quarter size hail) and applicable sourcing (either via indication from Doppler weather radar, or visual confirmation from storm spotters or other emergency management officials) and the level of impact to life and/or property. In order of increasing risk by warning type, these statements—which may be modified at the discretion of the regional forecast office—are:\n\nHazardous weather forecasts and alerts are provided to the public using the NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards system and through news media such as television, radio and internet sources. Many local television stations have overlay graphics which will either show a map or a list of the affected areas. The most common NWS weather alerts to be broadcast over NOAA Weather Radio using SAME technology are described in the following table:\n\nThe NWS uses several scales in describing weather events or conditions. Several common scales are described below.\n\nThe size of individual hailstones that reach surface level is determined by speed of the updraft which create the individual ice crystals at atmospheric levels. Larger hailstones are capable of producing damage to property, and particularly with very large hailstones, resulting in serious injury or death due to blunt-force trauma induced by the impact of the hailstones. Hailstone size is typically correspondent to the size of an object for comparative purposes.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> <br>\n\nThe Beaufort scale is an empirical measure that correlates wind speed to observed conditions at sea or on land.\n\nThe Enhanced Fujita scale, an updated version of the original Fujita scale that was developed by Ted Fujita with Allen Pearson, assigns a numerical rating from EF0 to EF5 to rate the damage intensity of tornadoes. EF0 and EF1 tornadoes are considered \"weak\" tornadoes, EF2 and EF3 are classified as \"strong\" tornadoes, with winds of at least major hurricane force, where EF4 and EF5 are categorized as \"violent\" tornadoes, with winds corresponding to category 5 hurricane winds and rising to match or exceed the strongest tropical cyclones on record. The EF scale is based on tornado damage (primarily to buildings), which makes it difficult to rate tornadoes that strike in sparsely populated areas, where few man-made structures are found. The Enhanced Fujita scale went into effect on February 1, 2007.\n\nThe Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, assigns a numerical classification of hurricanes into five categories distinguished by the intensities of their sustained winds. The scale spans from Category 1 (winds of at least ) to Category 5 (exceeding ). Unlike the Enhanced Fujita Scale, which assigns ratings for tornadoes after damage has been incurred and thoroughly assessed, categories on the Saffir-Simpson scale are assigned to most active cyclones that reach the minimum hurricane threshold, even before landfall.\n\n\n"}

According to a legend, the origin of the name may come from a cook called Angiolino, or \"Angelot\", an individual from Montferrat who is said to be the inventor of the recipe. Agnolotti can be \"di magro\" or \"di grasso\" depending on their filling of vegetables or meat.\n\nAlthough their primitive shape was semi-circular, traditionally agnolotti are of a square shape with sides of about one or two inches. However, they can also be of a smaller, rectangular shape when they are called agnolotti \"al plin\". \"Plin\" means \"a pinch\", because one pinches with thumb and forefinger between each mound of filling to close and seal the little pasta packets. \"Agnolotti\" \"al plin\" are almost always stuffed with meat.\n\nAgnolotti are prepared by immersion in boiling water. Typically, they are dressed with beef broth and a little melted butter or in a fresh sage and melted butter sauce, as a complex sauce would detract from the flavours in the agnolotti pockets. In both cases they may be topped with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, but no cheese is contained within agnolotti. The dish is associated with Piedmont in Italy and is not to be confused with Piacenza's stuffed pasta pockets called \"anolini\".\n\nIn the Monferrato region of Italy, located within Piedmont, a special version of agnolotti is filled with donkey meat.\n\nSimilar recipes without meat (e.g., with a stuffing of ricotta cheese and spinach) are not properly agnolotti but ravioli.\n\n"}

D. Crowe. Their first two albums, \"Bluegrass Evolution\" and the eponymous record known by the album number, \"Rounder 0044,\" established them as a dominant force in bluegrass, though the two albums are wildly different.\nThe New South have recorded and toured with a variety of different lineups. One of the most notable lineup changes came in 2002 when the entire band quit out of desire for a more active performing schedule, forming the band Wildfire. Crowe quickly found replacements (rehiring mandolinist/vocalist Dwight McCall and guitarist/ vocalist Rickey Wasson who had both been members previously) and the New South has continued a moderate performance schedule.\n\nCurrent and past members include: J.D. Crowe, Doyle Lawson, Tony Rice, Larry Rice, Bobby Slone, Ricky Skaggs, Jerry Douglas, Keith Whitley, Jimmy Gaudreau, Mike Gregory, Steve Bryant, Tony King, Phil Leadbetter, Richard Bennett, Robert Hale, Darrell Webb, Curt Chapman, Dwight McCall, Rickey Wasson, Wayne Fields, Harold Nixon, Randy Hayes, and Ron Stewart.\n\nJ.D. Crowe formed the prototype for the New South, the Kentucky Mountain Boys, around 1964. Members of the line-up included Red Allen, Larry Rice, Bobby Slone, and Doyle Lawson. The group recorded three albums on Lemco Records: \"Bluegrass Holiday\", \"Ramblin' Boy\", and a gospel album, \"The Model Church\". Lawson left the group in 1971 to join the Country Gentlemen, and was replaced by Larry Rice's younger brother, Tony Rice, a guitar prodigy and student of Clarence White.\n\nThe first album recorded as the \"New South\" was \"Bluegrass Evolution\". This album seems to have been influenced by the Osborne Brothers and by more mainstream country music; it incorporates drums, pedal steel and electric instruments to a far greater degree than most bluegrass bands of the period.\n\nAfter \"Bluegrass Evolution\", Larry Rice left the band. A young Ricky Skaggs replaced him, and Jerry Douglas also joined the group for this 1975 eponymously titled album, more commonly known by its Rounder Records catalogue number (\"Rounder 0044\"). Stylistically this album marked a sharp turn from \"Bluegrass Evolution\", while still experimenting with pedal steel, percussion and a piano on the tracks \"You Are What I Am\" and \"Cryin' Holy\", the majority of the album featured songs played with traditional bluegrass instrumentation (although on the slower numbers, Skaggs doubled his fiddle with a viola) by up-and-coming singer songwriters such as Gordon Lightfoot, Utah Phillips and Rodney Crowell, as well as incorporating more traditional songs such as \"Old Home Place,\" \"Some Old Day,\" and \"Sally Goodin.\" This one album changed the nature and direction of bluegrass music to an extent that everything after it has to be viewed in light of this album, and today this album is considered a landmark in bluegrass music without which no collection is complete.\n\nNot long after Rounder 0044's release, Tony Rice departed the band to join David Grisman's band. Skaggs and Douglas soon followed suit, forming their own band, Boone Creek. After experimenting with a few lineups, Crowe hired bassist Steve Bryant, mandolinist Jimmy Gadreau, as well as former Ralph Stanley guitarist Keith Whitley. This band produced three albums: \"My Home Ain't In the Hall of Fame\", \"Live in Japan\", and \"Somewhere Between\". All three of these albums saw the band returning toward the sound of the \"Bluegrass Evolution\" album, incorporating more country elements, with Crowe even playing electric guitar more than banjo on \"Somewhere Between\".\n\n\n"}

Sigma Psi Zeta is an official partner of the White House initiative, It's On Us, which launched as a result of the ARC3 Survey.\n\nSigma Psi Zeta currently has active memberships in the states/commonwealths of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, and Washington D.C. It has 36 memberships in the United States.\n\nPlans for the Sigma Psi Zeta sorority were formed in the Fall semester of 1993 at SUNY Albany by a group of female undergraduates from different backgrounds. The sorority was formed in part to address the dual difficulties faced by Asian women. On March 23, 1994 the sorority was officially recognized by the University. Within a year, a second chapter was formed at SUNY University at Binghamton.\n\nThe founding mothers were:\n\n\nSince 1999, Sigma Psi Zeta's philanthropy has been to combat violence against women. The sorority has worked against violence against women in many forms, and has focused specifically on Asian women who are historically objectified and disempowered. Local chapters and colonies participate in events such as the Take Back The Night rallies, and the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence's Domestic Violence Awareness month.\n\n\n\n"}

He became a teacher, first in Grenada County, then in the Abbeville Normal School in Abbeville, Mississippi, for three years. He next spent a year as instructor in the Grenada Female College at Grenada, Mississippi, and subsequently accepted a teaching position in the public schools of New Albany, Mississippi, where he was later made principal. In 1895 he retired from teaching to engage in farming in Lafayette County, Mississippi; and while residing there he was elected county superintendent of education in 1898 for a four- year term.\n\nHe was elected to the state legislature in 1904 and after serving for one term as a member of the House of Representatives, he was elected to represent Lafayette County in the state Senate in 1906, followed by reelection. While Mr. Hightower was a member of the state legislature he was active in having a state department of agriculture created and in securing the passage of a bill reducing the legal rate of interest from ten to eight per cent per annum.\n\nAfter serving a part of his second term in the legislature, however, he resigned to become state president of the Farmers Educational and Cooperative Union, a national farmers' organization, which position he occupied until 1912. In 1908 he was appointed a delegate to the International Cotton Conference held in Barcelona, Spain, which he attended in company with Harvey Jordan of Georgia, representative of the National Cotton Association of the United States and James H. Brooks, who represented the United States Department of State.\n\nHe became president of the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College at Starkville in 1912, now Mississippi State University, and remained at the head of that institution from until 1916. While serving as its president, he inaugurated a department of markets, which was the first of the kind to be established in any similar institution in the United States. The department of business of the college was also inaugurated during Mr. Hightower's administration as president. He was also instrumental in beautifying the college campus and planting the water oaks and elms.\n\nIn January, 1924, he was appointed as state tax commissioner by Governor H. L. Whitfield. Mr. Hightower served under Governor Whitfield's administration and also under Governor Murphree, who became governor of the state upon the death of Governor Whitfield March 18, 1927.\n\nAfter many years devoted to public service, Mr. Hightower concentrated on the cultivation of more than of land in Washington, Mississippi, near Natchez. He died February 19, 1958 and is buried in the Natchez City Cemetery. Hightower Hall at Mississippi State was named in his honor but has since been demolished.\n\n"}

It is around 40 kilometers north of Dublin.\n\nBrú na Bóinne is surrounded on its southern, western and eastern sides by the Boyne; additionally, a small tributary of the Boyne, the River Mattock, runs along the northern edge, almost completely surrounding Brú na Bóinne with water. All but two of the prehistoric sites are on this river peninsula.\n\nThe area has been a centre of human settlement for at least 6,000 years, but the major structures date to around 5,000 years ago, from the Neolithic period.\n\nThe site is a complex of Neolithic mounds, chamber tombs, standing stones, henges and other prehistoric enclosures, some from as early as 35th century BC - 32nd century BC. The site thus predates the Egyptian pyramids and was built with sophistication and a knowledge of science and astronomy, which is most evident in the passage grave of Newgrange. The site is often referred to as the \"Bend of the Boyne\" and this is often (incorrectly) taken to be a translation of \"Brú na Bóinne\". The associated archaeological culture is often called the Boyne culture.\n\nThe site covers 780 ha (1,927 acres) and contains around 40 passage graves, as well as other prehistoric sites and later features. The majority of the monuments are concentrated on the north side of the river. The most well-known sites within \"Brú na Bóinne\" are the passage graves of Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth, all known for their collections of megalithic art. Each stands on a ridge within the river bend and two of the tombs, Knowth and Newgrange, appear to contain stones re-used from an earlier monument at the site. Newgrange is the central mound of the Boyne Valley passage grave cemetery, the circular cairn in which the cruciform burial chamber is sited having a diameter of over 100 metres. Knowth and Dowth are of comparable size. There is no \"in situ\" evidence for earlier activity at the site, save for the spotfinds of flint tools left by Mesolithic hunters.\n\nThe passage tombs were constructed beginning in around 3,300 BC and work stopped around 2,900 BC. The three largest tombs of Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth may have been constructed to be visible from each other and from northern and southern approaches along the River Boyne, as part of a scheme to \"bind the previously disparate elements of the extended passage tomb cemetery into a more clearly defined prehistoric numinous precinct\". The area continued to be used for habitation and ritual purposes until the early Bronze Age, during which a number of embanked, pit and wooden post circles (collectively referred to as \"henges\") were built. Artifacts from the later Bronze Age are comparatively inconspicuous: some cist and ring ditch burials and burnt mounds. For the Iron Age there is only evidence of sporadic activity, such as burials near Knowth and at Rosnaree. Valuable items from the Roman period such as coins and jewelry were found as votive offerings near Newgrange.\n\nNumerous other enclosure and megalith sites have been identified within the river bend and have been given simple letter designations, such as the M Enclosures. In addition to the three large tombs, several other ceremonial sites constitute the complex including: \n\nEach of the three main megalith sites have significant archaeoastronomical significance. Newgrange and Dowth have Winter solstice solar alignments, while Knowth is oriented towards the spring and autumn Equinox. In addition, the immediate environs of the main sites have been investigated for other possible alignments. The layout and design of the Brú na Bóinne complex across the valley has also been studied for astronomical significance.\n\nAll access to Newgrange and Knowth is by guided tour only, with tours beginning at the Visitor Centre, opened in 1997 in Donore, County Meath. The tourist visitor centre is located on the south side of the river Boyne, and the historical site is located on the north side of the river and is accessed via a shuttle with a tour guide.\n\nBus Éireann route 163 operates between Drogheda and the Brú na Bóinne Visitor Centre via Donore.\nThe nearest railway station is Drogheda railway station approximately 9 kilometres distant.\n\n\n\n\n"}
