{"id": "2232897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232897", "title": "Sean Parker", "text": "Sean Parker\n\nSean Parker (born December 3, 1979) is an American entrepreneur and philanthropist, most notable for co-founding the file-sharing computer service Napster, and serving as the first president of the social networking website Facebook. He also co-founded Plaxo, Causes, Airtime.com, and Brigade, an online platform for civic engagement. He is the founder and chairman of the Parker Foundation, which focuses on life sciences, global public health, and civic engagement. On the \"Forbes\" 2016 list of the world's billionaires, he was ranked #722 with a net worth of US$2.4 billion.\n\nParker was born in Herndon, Virginia, to Diane Parker, a TV advertising broker, and Bruce Parker, a U.S. government oceanographer. When Parker was seven, his father taught him how to program on an Atari 800. Parker's father, who put his family before his entrepreneurial dreams, told Parker \"if you are going to take risks, take them early before you have a family.\" As a teenager, Parker's hobbies were hacking and programming. One night, while hacking into the network of a Fortune 500 company, Parker was unable to log out after his father confiscated his computer keyboard. Because his IP address was exposed, F.B.I. agents tracked down the 16-year-old. Since Parker was under 18, he was sentenced to community service.\n\nParker attended Oakton High School in Fairfax County, Virginia for two years before transferring to Chantilly High School in 1996 for his junior and senior years. While there, Parker wrote a letter to the school administration and persuaded them to count the time he spent coding in the computer lab as a foreign language class. As a result, towards the end of Parker's senior year at Chantilly, he was mostly writing code and starting companies. He graduated in 1998. While still in high school, he interned for Mark Pincus (the CEO of Zynga) at Pincus's Washington D.C. startup FreeLoader. He won the Virginia state computer science fair for developing a Web crawler, and was recruited by the CIA. By his senior year of high school, Parker was earning more than $80,000 a year through various projects, enough to convince his parents to allow him to skip college and pursue a career as an entrepreneur.\n\nAs a child, Parker was an avid reader, which was the beginning of his lifelong autodidacticism. Several media profiles refer to Parker as a genius. He considers his time at Napster to be his college education, calling it \"Napster University,\" since he became well-versed in intellectual property law, corporate finance, and entrepreneurship.\n\nWhen Parker was 15, he met 14-year-old Shawn Fanning over the Internet, where the two bonded over topics like theoretical physics and hacking. A few years later Parker and Fanning, a student at Northeastern University, cofounded Napster, a free file-sharing service for music. Parker raised the initial $50,000, and they launched Napster in June 1999. Within a year, the service had tens of millions of users. Napster was opposed by recording labels, the Recording Industry Association of America, and the heavy metal band Metallica, among others. Lawsuits by various industry associations eventually shut down the service. Napster has been called the fastest-growing business of all time, is credited with revolutionizing the music industry, and is considered by some to be a precursor to iTunes.\n\nIn November 2002, Parker launched Plaxo, an online address book and social networking service that integrated with Microsoft Outlook. Plaxo was an early social networking tool, which would later influence the growth of companies like LinkedIn, Zynga, and Facebook. Plaxo was one of the first products to build virality into its launch, and that earned it 20 million users. Two years after founding Plaxo, Parker was ousted by the company's financiers, Sequoia Capital and Ram Shriram, in an acrimonious exit that reportedly involved the investors hiring private investigators to follow him.\n\nIn 2004, Parker saw a site called \"The Facebook\" on the computer of his roommate's girlfriend, who was a student at Stanford. Parker had experience in the social networking industry as an early advisor to Friendster and its founder, Jonathan Abrams, for which he was given a small amount of stock in 2003. Parker met with Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin, and a few months later joined the five-month-old company as its president. According to Peter Thiel, Facebook's first investor, Sean Parker was the first to see potential in the company to be \"really big,\" and that \"if Mark ever had any second thoughts, Sean was the one who cut that off.\"\n\nAs president, Parker brought on Thiel as Facebook's first investor. In the initial round of funding, he negotiated for Zuckerberg to retain three of Facebook's five board seats, which gave Zuckerberg control of the company and allowed Facebook the freedom to remain a private company. Additionally, Parker is said to have championed Facebook's clean user interface and developed its photo-sharing function. Zuckerberg notes that \"Sean was pivotal in helping Facebook transform from a college project into a real company.\"\n\nDuring a party in 2005, police entered and searched a vacation home Parker was renting and found cocaine. Parker was arrested on suspicion of drug possession, but was not charged. This event caused Facebook investors to pressure Parker into resigning as company president. Even after stepping down, Parker continued to remain involved with Facebook's growth and met regularly with Zuckerberg. The event was later dramatized in the movie \"The Social Network\".\n\nIn 2017, during an interview with Axios, Parker expressed concerns about the role of Facebook in society, saying that it \"exploit[s] a vulnerability in human psychology\" as it creates a \"social-validation feedback loop\". Parker stated that he was \"something of a conscientious objector\" to using social media.\n\nWhile working at Founders Fund, Parker had been looking to invest in a company that could further Napster's music sharing mission legally. In 2009, a friend showed him Spotify, a Swedish streaming music service, and Parker sent an email to Spotify's founder Daniel Ek. The pair traded emails, and in 2010 Parker invested US$15 million in Spotify. Parker, who currently serves on Spotify's board, negotiated with Warner and Universal on Spotify's behalf, and in July 2011, Spotify announced its U.S. launch. At Facebook's f8 conference that year, Parker announced a partnership between Facebook and Spotify, which allowed users to share their Spotify playlists on their Facebook profiles.\n\nIn April 2014, Parker announced his backing of a new initiative called Brigade, an online platform for civic engagement to \"combat a lack of political engagement and interest in all levels of government across America\". Parker serves as the Executive Chairman of Brigade. The initial round of funding was $9.3 million from Parker, with additional sums from other investors. In 2014, Brigade acquired Causes, an online platform for social impact and political activism. Causes had in 2013 acquired Votizen, a political advocacy startup. Parker and The Founders Fund were a part of Votizen's $1.5 million funding round in 2010, and Parker served on the board of directors. He has stated, \"Politics for me is the most obvious area [to be disrupted by the Web].\"\n\nIn 2006, Parker became managing partner at Founders Fund, a San Francisco-based venture capital fund founded by Peter Thiel. Founders Fund is focused on investing in early-stage companies, has $500 million in aggregate capital, and has invested in Quantcast, Path, and Knewton. Parker was given carte blanche by Thiel when finding investments. In 2014, Parker stepped down from his role at Founders Fund to focus on other projects. Parker has also hosted The TechFellow Awards, a partnership between TechCrunch and Founders Fund that annually gives 20 entrepreneurs $100,000 each to invest in startups.\n\nSince 2005, Parker has been an active donor to cancer research, global public health and civic engagement. In 2012, he pledged a $5 million grant to Stand Up to Cancer and the Cancer Research Institute to create the Immunotherapy Dream Team, uniting laboratory and clinical efforts that will lead to the immunological treatment, control and prevention of cancer. In December 2014, Parker pledged $24 million to create the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy Research at Stanford. In 2015, he made a $4.5 million grant to support the Malaria Elimination Initiative at the University of California San Francisco's Global Health Group, and a $10 million grant to create the Sean N. Parker Autoimmune Research Laboratory at UCSF.\n\nParker is an active supporter of groups including Code for America, Stand up to Cancer, the Cancer Research Institute, Malaria No More, the Clinton Foundation, ONE, and the \"\" campaign.\n\nIn 2007, Parker founded Causes, originally one of the earliest Facebook applications, as a philanthropic service that uses social media to connect charities with their supporters and potential donors and then communicates that connection to the user's network of friends. By 2013, 186 million people had joined Causes, donating over $50 million to 60,000 non-profits.\n\nIn June 2015, Parker announced a $600 million contribution to launch the Parker Foundation, which focuses on three areas: Life Sciences, Global Public Health and Civic Engagement. It takes an interdisciplinary approach to large-scale challenges, combining insight, capital, science and technology, organization building and public policy.\n\nParker donated $250 million to create the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, in April 2016. The funds initially went to over 300 scientists at 40 laboratories, in 6 institutions.\n\nStarting in 2016, the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy scientists funded a clinical trial to test the next wave of cancer-fighting T-cells engineered using the CRISPR gene-editing technology. The trial was the first in the United States to test CRISPR-modified cells in humans. The trial is led by the University of Pennsylvania and is also conducted at University of California, San Francisco and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n\nIn November 2017, \"Science\" published a study from Parker Institute researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center showing that melanoma patients who have specific types of bacteria and a greater microbial diversity in their gut microbiome responded better to an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor versus those with less diversity. Based on this work, the Parker Institute is collaborating with MD Anderson and industry partner Seres Therapeutics to launch a microbiome-cancer immunotherapy clinical trial for advanced melanoma patients.\n\nParker also serves on the boards of the following non-profits\n\nIn February 2015, Parker was ranked number 5 on the Chronicle of Philanthropy's 2014 Philanthropy 50 list. In August 2018, Parker was nominated as a Wired Magazine \"Icon\" along with Alex Marson for his research in DNA programming and genome editing in the fight against cancer. He's also been named one of Town and Country's Top 50 Philanthropists and was named in Time Magazine's Healthcare 50 for his work in connecting cancer research. In 2016, he was given the \"Pontifical Key Philanthropy Award\" by Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi at the Vatican for his cancer work.\n\nParker has made substantial donations to both sides of U.S. party politics; his allegedly \"non-partisan\" approach favors contributions to \"elected officials who have shown themselves willing to work across the aisle\". He favored Democrats as well as progressive causes such as campaign finance reform and gun control; he has spoken out in favor of higher taxes, particularly for the \"wealthy and super wealthy,\" and in favor of higher capital gains taxes. Parker has also supported middle-of-the-road Republican candidates and super PACs, favoring \"economically moderate\" conservatives and candidates with a demonstrated interest in compromise and deal-making. In Washington, he has met with Republican lawmakers about ways of encouraging economic investment in struggling areas of the country. He has also supported cannabis law reform and in 2010, following the example of donations by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz (totaling $70,000) donated $100,000 to the 2010 California Proposition 19 campaign to legalize marijuana in that state and $400,000 to the Democratic Party backed 2016 California Proposition 63 campaign to require background checks for all ammunition purchases. Parker will donate $250 million to launch a new institute aimed at developing more effective cancer treatments by fostering collaboration among leading researchers in the field. For the 2016 presidential election, Parker created a social ballot guide for voters to help each other pledge to vote.\n\nParker was also a driving force behind the Opportunity Zones provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 which are designed to incentivize investments in struggling American communities. In 2015, the Economic Innovation Group, which Parker co-founded, published a whitepaper on the idea of opportunity zones, and in 2017, a bill passing them into law was shepherded by a bi-partisan coalition involving Senator Cory Booker and Senator Tim Scott.\n\nParker was portrayed by Justin Timberlake in the 2010 film \"The Social Network\". The movie is an account of Facebook's founding and early days.\n\nAlthough Parker praised David Fincher as a director, many have remarked on the differences between Parker and his portrayal by Timberlake. Former Facebook growth chief Chamath Palihapitiya noted that Parker is \"really the exact opposite of his portrayal in the film\". Parker took issue with the movie version of Eduardo Saverin's exit from Facebook, as it paralleled his own exit from Plaxo. Parker called the character a \"morally reprehensible human being,\" although he noted that \"it's hard to complain about being played by a sex symbol\".\n\nIn 2011, Parker was a guest on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\", featured on the cover of the \"Forbes 400\" issue, and was profiled in \"Vanity Fair\".\n\nIn 2011, Parker became engaged to Alexandra Lenas, a singer-songwriter, and they were married in 2013. The couple has a daughter, Winter Victoria Parker, born on January 6, 2013, and a son, Zephyr Emerson Parker, born on December 1, 2014.\n\nOn June 1, 2013, Parker married Alexandra Lenas in Big Sur, California, in a wedding at which every guest was given a \"Lord of the Rings\"–style costume. The wedding purportedly cost $10 million to stage, though Parker describes this estimate as \"WAY off base\".\n\nThe wedding was the subject of an article in \"The Atlantic\" alleging environmental damage to the redwood forest to which Parker responded in detail, highlighting his cooperation with the Save the Redwoods League throughout. A required permit was not obtained. In addition, the venue from which he hired the space was not permitted to close it to the public. A California Coastal Commission spokesperson said \"Mr. Parker, in essence, leased an ongoing Coastal Act violation when he leased the campground\". As part of his settlement with the Commission, Parker gave $2.5 million and created a beach-mapping app. Former Coastal Commissioner Assemblyman Mark Stone said, \"To be able to put money back into the same community that cares so much about coastal resources is a very positive thing.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2232904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232904", "title": "Eliza Cook", "text": "Eliza Cook\n\nEliza Cook (24 December 181823 September 1889) was an English author and poet associated with the Chartist movement. She was a proponent of political freedom for women, and believed in the ideology of self-improvement through education, something she called \"levelling up.\" This made her hugely popular with the working class public in both England and America.\n\nEliza Cook was the youngest of the eleven children of a brazier (a brass-worker) living in London Road, Southwark, where she was born. When she was about nine years old her father retired from business, and the family went to live at a small farm in St. Leonard's Forest, near Horsham. Her mother encouraged Eliza's fondness for imaginative literature, and despite attending the local Sunday school the child was almost entirely self-educated. At Sunday School she was encouraged by the music master's son to produce her first volume of poetry. She began to write verses before she was fifteen, contributing to the \"Weekly Dispatch\" and \"New Monthly\", and published her first poetry collection two years later; indeed, some of her most popular poems, such as \"I'm afloat\" and the \"Star of Glengarry,\" were composed in her girlhood. \n\nHer first volume, \"Lays of a Wild Harp\", appeared in 1835, when she was only seventeen. Encouraged by its favourable reception, she began to send verses anonymously to the \"Weekly Dispatch\", the \"Metropolitan Magazine\", the \"New Monthly Magazine\", and \"The Literary Gazette\"; William Jerdan sang her praises in the last of these. After a time she confined herself to the radical \"Weekly Dispatch\", where her first contribution had appeared under the signature 'C.' on 27 Nov 1836, and she became a staple of its pages for the next ten years. Its editor was William Johnson Fox and its owner was James Harmer, a London alderman. She lived for a time at Harmer's residence, Ingress Abbey, in Greenhithe, Kent, and wrote certain of her works there.\n\nHer poem \"The Old Armchair\" (1838) made hers a household name for a generation, both in England and the United States. In that year, she published \"Melaia and other Poems\".\n\nHer work for the \"Dispatch\" and \"New Monthly\" was pirated by George Julian Harney, the Chartist, for the \"Northern Star\". Familiar with the London Chartist movement in its various sects, she followed many of the older radicals in disagreeing with the O'Brienites and O'Connorites in their disregard for the repeal of the Corn Laws. She also preferred the older Radicals' path of Friendly Societies and self-education.\n\nFrom 1849 to 1854 she wrote, edited, and published \"Eliza Cook's Journal,\" a weekly periodical she described as one of \"utility and amusement.\" The periodical was described as having \"variety, piquancy, benevolent aim, and hardly had a superior\" in comparison to other periodicals of the time. Although some found solace in Cook's work, the periodical was short lived due to lack of appreciation among the majority. After a noble struggle to keep the periodical afloat and through health issues the periodical ultimately fell.\n\nCook went on to publish \"Jottings from my Journal\" (1860), where a lot of \"Eliza Cook's Journal\"'s contents reappeared. This publication was one of the few times Cook wrote in prose. It included many essays and sketches that were written in a clear and simple manner, usually conveying a moral lesson for the reader. Some of the essays are \"mild satires on the social failings of her contemporaries,\" and exhibit good sense and even some humor.\n\nShe also published, \"New Echoes\" \"and Other Poems\" (1864), which showed more limited power when compared to her previous work and therefore did not find as much success as her previous efforts.\n\nDespite a lack of interest in her later works, Eliza Cook still had become a staple of anthologies throughout the century.\n\nAt the time Cook was a Chartist, one of \"a body of 19th century English political reformers advocating better social and industrial conditions for the working classes.\" The goal of Chartist poetry is to create a sense of camaraderie for the people within a vast community who found themselves oppressed and suffering.\n\nIn her poem \"A Song for the Workers,\" Cook emphasizes the importance of shorter working hours. Within this poem she goes on to compare the treatment of laborers to that of the slaves in America. In another poem, \"Our Father,\" Cook speaks out against child labor at the time and once again compares child labor to slavery. She also implies how children working such vigorous jobs turn their brains \"dull and torpid,\" engaged in hard tasks that do not allow them to be children.\n\nAlong with these views Cook was a proponent of political and sexual freedom for women, and believed in the ideology of self-improvement through education, something she called \"levelling up.\" This made her a great favourite with the working-class public.\n\nNot much is known about Cook's view on sexuality; however, through speculation researchers would infer that Eliza Cook and some of her readers were lesbian women. Her peers described her as having short \"boyish\" hair, a \"mannish appearance,\" and mentioned that she wore lapelled jackets which showed off her shirt front and ruffles, described as \"a very masculine style, which was considered strange at the time.\"\n\nShe was a close friend and lover of the American actress Charlotte Cushman. Cook and Cushman sometimes wore matching dresses, a practice to symbolize their friendship and \"difference from heterosexual women.\"\n\nOn June 18, 1863 Eliza Cook received a Civil List pension of £100 a year. Afterwards she published only a few poems in the \"Weekly Dispatch\", and quickly became what was described as a \"confirmed invalid.\" Despite her loss in popularity, she still collected royalties from her publishers almost up to the end of her life. In the 1870 census she is recorded as living at Beech House, 23 Thornton Hill, Wimbledon, Surrey, along with a maid, Mary A. Bowles, her sister Mary Fyall, nephew Alfred Pyall, his wife Harriet, and their daughters Mary and Jane.\n\nCook's state of health prevented her writing anything new, or revising her existing works. After many years of suffering on and off from illness she died at her home at Beech House on September 23, 1890. Cook's personal estate was £5,957 9s, and her will was proved by her brother Charles Cook and her nephew Alfred, still resident of Beech House. She is buried at St. Mary's Church, Wimbledon.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2232908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232908", "title": "Syrinx (bird anatomy)", "text": "Syrinx (bird anatomy)\n\nThe syrinx (Greek σύριγξ for pan pipes) is the vocal organ of birds. Located at the base of a bird's trachea, it produces sounds without the vocal folds of mammals. The sound is produced by vibrations of some or all of the \"membrana tympaniformis\" (the walls of the syrinx) and the \"pessulus\", caused by air flowing through the syrinx. This sets up a self-oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape by changing the tension of the membranes and the bronchial openings. The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx in mammals, the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization is possible, with muscles on the left and right branch modulating vibrations independently so that some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time. Some species of birds, such as New World vultures, lack a syrinx and communicate through throaty hisses.\n\nBirds do have a larynx, but unlike in mammals, it does not vocalize.\n\nThe position of the syrinx, structure and musculature varies widely across bird groups. In some groups the syrinx covers the lower end of the trachea and the upper parts of the bronchi in which case the syrinx is said to be tracheobronchial, the most frequent form and the one found in all songbirds. The syrinx may be restricted to the bronchi as in some non-passerines, notably the owls, cuckoos and nightjars. The syrinx may also be restricted to the trachea and this is found in a very small number of bird groups that are sometimes known as tracheophonae, a subset of the suboscine passeriformes that include Furnariidae (ovenbirds), Dendrocolaptidae (woodcreepers), Formicariidae (ground antbirds), Thamnophilidae (typical antbirds), Rhinocryptidae (tapaculos), and Conopophagidae (gnateaters). The trachea are covered in partly ossified rings known as tracheal rings. Tracheal rings tend to be complete, while the bronchial rings are C shaped and the unossified part has smooth muscles running along them. The trachea are usual circular or oval in cross section in most birds but are flattened in ibises. The trachea is simple and tubular in ducks. The last few tracheal rings and the first few bronchial rings may fuse to form what is called the tympanic box. At the base of the trachea and at the joint of the bronchi a median dorsoventral structure, the pessulus, may be developed to varying extents. The pessulus is bony in passerines and provides attachment to membranes, anteriorly to the semilunar membranes. The membrane that forms part of the first three bronchial rings is responsible for vibrating and producing the sound in most passerines. These membranes may also be attached to the pessulus. In some species like the hill-myna, \"Gracula religiosa\", there is wide gap between the second and third bronchial semirings where large muscles are attached, allowing the inner diameter to be varied widely. Other muscles are also involved in syringeal control, these can be intrinsic or extrinsic depending on whether they are within the syrinx or attached externally. The extrinsic muscles include the sternotrachealis from the sternum.\n\n"}
{"id": "2232917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232917", "title": "São Tomé and Príncipe dobra", "text": "São Tomé and Príncipe dobra\n\nThe dobra is the currency of São Tomé and Príncipe. It is abbreviated Db and is divided into 100 cêntimos. The first dobra (STD) was introduced in 1977, replacing the escudo at par. Due to past inflation, on 1 January 2018 the dobra was redenominated at a rate of 1000 to 1, and given the new ISO 4217 currency code STN.\n\nSão Tomé and Príncipe signed a deal with Portugal in 2009, linking the dobra with the euro. The exchange rate was fixed at 1 EUR = STD on 1 January 2010, which means that the new dobra is pegged to the euro at €1 = STN / nDb.\n\nThe name derives from Portuguese \"dóbra\", meaning \"doubloon.\"\n\nIn 1977, coins were introduced for 50 cêntimos, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 dobras. Except for the brass 50 cêntimos and 1 dobra, these coins were struck in cupro-nickel, as was the 50 dobras introduced in 1990. These coins depicted a combination of food produce and local flora and fauna. These coins, although seldom seen in circulation today due to chronic inflation have never been demonetized and can still be used as tender.\n\nIn 1997, a new coin series with larger denominations was introduced consisting of 100, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 dobras. Of these, the 100 and 250 dobras are round, the larger of the three are equilaterally curved heptagonal. These coins were all struck in nickel-plated steel and depict wildlife-related themes. \n\nAll circulating coins bear the country's coat of arms on the obverse, with the text \"Aumentemos a Produção\" and the valuation on the reverse.\n\nWith the redenomination of the dobra in 2018, coins were introduced in denominations of 10, 20, and 50 cêntimos and 1 and 2 dobras.\n\nOn 30 September 1977, notes were introduced for 50, 100, 500 and 1000 dobras by the Banco Nacional de São Tomé e Príncipe. In 1996, 5000, 10,000, 20,000 and 50,000 dobras notes were introduced, with the lowest denomination notes from the previous series being replaced by coins in 1997. A new issue was released in 2006 with upgraded security features.\n\nIn December 2008, the 100,000 dobras note was introduced as continuous inflation deemed the new denomination necessary. The note has been very well received and accepted by the general public.\n\nAll notes bear the portrait of Rei Amador on the obverse, however, on the 100,000 dobras note is the printed portrait of Francisco José Tenreiro.\n\nBanknotes of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 dobras were issued in 2018 with the redenomination of the dobra. The 5 and 10 dobra notes are printed in polymer, and all the banknotes feature various species of butterfly on the obverse with local wildlife depicted on the reverses.\n\nIn July 2009, the government of São Tomé and Príncipe signed a loan deal with Portugal, its one-time colonial mother country. The agreement was intended to tie the dobra to the euro. Portugal will provide as much as 25 million euro in a move endorsed by the European Commission. São Tomé and Príncipe claimed that linking the dobra to the euro would \"guarantee stability\" in the country. It is also expected to attract foreign investment.\n\nOfficials spent one year negotiating the accord, which took effect in January 2010. The agreement follows a similar one which Portugal signed ten years previously with Cape Verde.\n\nOn August 25, 2017, the Central Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe (\"Banco Central de São Tomé e Príncipe\") announced a redenomination of the dobra, in commemoration of the Central Bank's 25th anniversary, with 1 new dobra equal to 1,000 of the previous dobras. Six banknotes (in denominations of 5-, 10-, 20-, 50-, 100 and 200 new dobras, with the two lower denominations printed in polymer) and five coins (in denominations of 10-, 20- and 50 cêntimos and 1 and 2 new dobras) were issued on January 1, 2018. The old and new series of notes circulated concurrently until 30 June 2018, after which they are exchangeable or depositable in commercial banks until 31 December 2018 and at the Central Bank until 31 December 2019.\n\n\n"}

Until its cancellation in November 2013, his program \"The War Room with Quinn and Rose\" was aired on 12 stations across the U.S. and was also heard on XM Satellite Radio Channel 244 from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.\n\nBefore beginning his political morning show, Quinn spent a number of years at KQV in the 1960s and 1970s, where he befriended his eventual political mentor Rush Limbaugh. Limbaugh worked at KQV and at WIXZ in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, as a disc jockey under the name Jeff Christie.\n\nQuinn is best remembered in the Pittsburgh area as the vociferous nighttime host on KQV radio in the 1960s, during the station's peak as a Top 40 power. Quinn was hired from WING/Dayton in 1967 and had an immediate impact on the market. In 1968, he jumped at an opportunity to take a job at WIBG Radio 99 in Philadelphia, but was back at KQV in less than a year. He stayed until 1972, then spent time in New York City at WPIX-FM.\n\nHe then moved to Buffalo, New York, where in the late 1970s he became known to listeners throughout the northeast on WWKB (WKBW at the time), a 50,000-watt station that took requests from as far away as Norway. Quinn's final hour included a trivia game called \"Stump The Audience\", where the answers had been kept \"in a sealed envelope on Funk and Wagnalls' doorstep since noon today\". In an emotional farewell as he returned to Pittsburgh, Quinn said, \"May I get lockjaw if I ever forget how much I appreciate the people who listen.\"\n\nA Pittsburgh station, 13Q or WKTQ, lured him back in 1977 to capture the adults who had grown up listening to him on KQV. During his tenure at 13Q, Quinn issued a parody 45 rpm record of the then Top 40 hit \"Undercover Angel\" entitled \"Undercover Pothole\"; the parody lamented the atrocious condition of Pittsburgh roads during that period. In 1979 Quinn moved to the midday slot at WTAE radio, an adult contemporary station in Pittsburgh, under the aegis of General Manager Ted Atkins (\"Captain Showbiz\"). In 1983, he became half of \"\"The Quinn and Banana Show\"\" alongside Don Jefferson on B-94 FM, which ran in Pittsburgh until 1992. Their format was bathroom humor. After a course of conduct wherein they implied that News Director Liz Randolph was promiscuous, she sued the station and Quinn and Banana for defamation and sexual harassment. On Valentine's Day 1990, Randolph won on all counts, and a jury awarded her $694,000. Three years later, his FM morning show was canceled. Quinn largely credits this lawsuit with \"opening his eyes\" and inducing his conversion to political conservatism.\n\nAfter Quinn's program was canceled on B-94, he moved in 1993 to WRRK, where he gradually adopted his conservative political talk format. The program started in music format with Quinn as D.J., as \"Quinn in the Morning\". But increasingly during breaks in music and during news reading he would editorialize. With the positive response he got from callers, and with increased ratings vs. the dominant a.m. radio\" The DVE Morning Show\" on WDVE(with Scott Paulson and Jim Krenn), the format eventually became entirely talk, focusing on conservative views of current events, and remained the only talk show on an otherwise music radio format. The program eventually moved to WPGB radio in 2004 when that station adopted an all talk format that included conservative nationally syndicated shows like \"The Rush Limbaugh Show\". Given the nature of his politics, the show was always locally controversial based on political affiliation. By 2008, Quinn's inflammatory language had earned him notoriety; for example, the Bill Moyers \"Journal\" on PBS noted he referred to the National Organization for Women as the \"National Organization for Whores\", which was often reported out of its full context, since Quinn would continue \"...they're whores for liberal politics in general, and they were whores for Bill Clinton in particular.\" \"The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" reported that as of November 18, 2013, Quinn and his radio partner, Rose Somma Tennent, had been removed from the WPGB lineup.\n\nQuinn is a proponent of a constitutional government that adheres to the guiding principles of the nation's founders. He champions a smaller federal government and free markets. He regularly equates modern Left Liberalism with Marxism. He commonly refers to \"Quinn's Laws\", a collection of statements that sum up his world view, such as \"Liberalism always generates the exact opposite of its stated intent\" (e.g., the War on Poverty has led to even greater poverty). He also has many personal views he is fond of voicing, such as \"liberty is the solution to the human condition\".\n\nThe show, broadcast with co-host Rose Somma Tennent (aka \"Radio Rose\"), aired live weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. EST on certain affiliates and on XM Satellite Radio Channel 244; others replay the first hour after 9. It can be heard worldwide on the Internet via Warroom.com. Quinn's radio show abruptly ended in a contract dispute with Clear Channel radio in November 2013.\n\nQuinn authored a so-called \"liberal version\" of \"The Ant and the Grasshopper\" in 1994.\n\nAfter unsuccessfully negotiating to bring his show to WJAS in Pittsburgh (the station that picked up most of WPGB's lineup after a format change), Quinn agreed to resume his morning show on one of his former affiliates, WYSL, a station located outside of Rochester, New York.\n\n"}
{"id": "2232929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232929", "title": "Chronotope", "text": "Chronotope\n\nIn literary theory and philosophy of language, the chronotope is how configurations of time and space are represented in language and discourse. The term was taken up by Russian literary scholar M.M. Bakhtin who used it as a central element in his theory of meaning in language and literature. The term itself comes from the Russian , which in turn is derived from the Greek ' ('time') and ' ('space'); it thus can be literally translated as \"time-space.\" Bakhtin developed the term in his 1937 essay \"Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel\" (). Here Bakhtin showed how different literary genres operated with different configurations of time and space, which gave each genre its particular narrative character. For example, the chronotopic frame of the epic differed from that of the hero adventure or the comedy.\n\nIn the philosophy of language and philology, Bakhtin scholars Caryl Emerson and Michael Holquist state that the chronotope is \"a unit of analysis for studying language according to the ratio and characteristics of the temporal and spatial categories represented in that language\". Specific chronotopes are said to correspond to particular genres, or relatively stable ways of speaking, which themselves represent particular worldviews or ideologies. To this extent, a chronotope is both a cognitive concept and a narrative feature of language.\n\nIn \"Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel,\" Bakhtin defines the chronotope thus:\n\nThe concept of the chronotope has been most widely used in literary studies. The scholar Timo Müller for example argued that analysis of chronotopes highlights the environmental dimension of literary texts because it draws attention to the concrete physical spaces in which stories take place. Müller discusses the chronotope of the road, which for Bakhtin was a meeting place but in recent literature no longer brings people together in this way because automobiles have changed the way we perceive the time and space of the road. Car drivers want to minimize the time they spend on the road. They are rarely interested in the road as a physical space, the natural environment around the road, or the environmental implications of their driving. This contrasts with earlier literary examples such as Robert Frost's poem \"The Road Not Taken\" or John Steinbeck's novel \"The Grapes of Wrath\", where the road is described as part of the natural environment and the travelers are interested in that environment.\n\nLinguistic anthropologist Keith Basso invoked \"chronotopes\" in discussing Western [Apache] stories linked with places. In the 1980s when Basso was writing, geographic features reminded the Western Apache of \"the moral teachings of their history\" by recalling to mind events that occurred there in important moral narratives. By merely mentioning \"it happened at [the place called] 'men stand above here and there,'\" storyteller Nick Thompson could remind locals of the dangers of joining \"with outsiders against members of their own community.\" Geographic features in the Western Apache landscape are chronotopes, Basso says, in precisely the way Bakhtin defines the term when he says they are \"points in the geography of a community where time and space intersect and fuse. Time takes on flesh and becomes visible for human contemplation; likewise, space becomes charged and responsive to the movements of time and history and the enduring character of a people. ...Chronotopes thus stand as monuments to the community itself, as symbols of it, as forces operating to shape its members' images of themselves\" (qtd. in Basso 1984: 44–45).\n\nAnthropologist of syncretism Safet HadžiMuhamedović built upon Bakhtin’s term in his ethnography of the Field of Gacko in the southeastern Bosnian highlands. In \"Waiting for\" \"Elijah: Time and Encounter in a Bosnian Landscape\", he argued that people and landscapes may sometimes be trapped between timespaces and thus \"schizochronotopic\" (from the Greek σχίζειν (\"skhizein\"): \"to split\"). He described two overarching chronotopes as \"collective timespace themes\", both of which relied on certain kinds of past and laid claims to the Field’s future. One was told through proximities, the other through distances between religious communities. For HadžiMuhamedović, schizochronotopia is a rift occurring within the same body/landscape, through which the past and the present of place have rendered each other unbidden. \n\nThe chronotope has also been adopted for the analysis of classroom events and conversations, for example by Raymond Brown and Peter Renshaw in order to view \"student participation in the classroom as a dynamic process constituted through the interaction of past experience, ongoing involvement, and yet-to-be-accomplished goals\" (2006: 247–259). Kumpulainen, Mikkola, and Jaatinen (2013) examined the space–time configurations of students’ technology-mediated creative learning practices over a year-long school musical project in a Finnish elementary school. The findings of their study suggest that \"blended practices appeared to break away from traditional learning practices, allowing students to navigate in different time zones, spaces, and places with diverse tools situated in their formal and informal lives\" (2013: 53).\n\n"}

It was formed out of territories the Habsburgs conquered from the Ottoman Empire and included southern parts of Slavonia and Syrmia; today the area it covered is mostly in eastern Croatia, with its easternmost parts in northern Serbia (mostly in Vojvodina region).\n\nThe Slavonian Military Frontier was divided between three regiments: Regiment N°VII, based at Vinkovci; Regiment N°VIII, based at Nova Gradiška and Regiment N°IX, based at Petrovaradin.\n\nOther important towns in the area included Sremski Karlovci, Stara Pazova, Zemun, and Sremska Mitrovica.\n\nDuring the history, name Slavonian Military Frontier referred to different territories. It was first located in what is now Central Croatia and was known as the Varaždin generalat. It was created from territories that had been part of medieval Banovina of Slavonia. Shortly after its creation in the 16th century, original Slavonian Military Frontier bordered the Ottoman Empire to the east, the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia (part of the Habsburg Monarchy) to the west, the Croatian Military Frontier to the south-west, and the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, also part of the Habsburg Empire, to the north.\n\nAfter the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699), Habsburg Monarchy expanded its territory towards east and new sections of the Military Frontier were founded along the Sava, Danube, Tisa and Mureş rivers. New parts of the frontier were divided into two generalats: the first one included territory from Gradiška to river Tisa and the second one included territories along the Tisa and Mureş rivers. Until the middle of the 18th century, the entire Slavonia region was under military administration. In 1745, northern parts of Slavonia were placed under civil administration and were organized into the newly formed Habsburg crownland known as the Kingdom of Slavonia. The southern parts of Slavonia that remained under military administration were organized into Slavonian Military Frontier, while former original Slavonian Military Frontier was organized as Varaždin section of the Croatian Military Frontier.\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, the Slavonian Military Frontier bordered the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia and the Croatian Military Frontier to the west, the Habsburg Kingdom of Slavonia and the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary to the north, the Banat Military Frontier to the east and the Ottoman province of Bosnia and Sanjak of Smederevo to the south. In 1783 it was placed under the unified control of the Croatian General Command () headquartered in Zagreb. The only changes of this province's borders and neighborhood before its integration into Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia in 1881 were in 1848–1849 when autonomous Serbian Vojvodina included eastern parts of Slavonian Military Frontier and between 1849 and 1860, during the existence of Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, a separate Habsburg crownland which became a north-eastern neighbor of Slavonian Military Frontier. After the creation of the Principality of Serbia in 1815, this was their southeastern neighbor.\n\nIn 1776, the rural population of the Slavonian military frontier was 177,212. The number of Roman Catholic men was 43,635, while number of Orthodox men was 33,970. The number of inhabitants of cities was 11,353, and that giving a total of 188,565 inhabitants.\n\nIn Brod and Gradiška regiments Catholics outnumbered the minority Orthodox, and in Petrovaradin regiment the Orthodox were more numerous.\n\nIn 1820, population of Slavonian Military Frontier included 117,933 Catholics and 117,274 Orthodox Christians.\n\nIn 1870, Slavonian military frontier had, according to official census, 246,901 inhabitants. Of that number 143,873 were Roman Catholic and 92,991 were Orthodox (living mainly in eastern Syrmia). Brod regiment had 82,540 inhabitants out of which 73,892 were Roman Catholic and 6,886 were Orthodox. Gradiška regiment had 61,596 inhabitants out of which 45,601 were Roman Catholic and 15,933 were Orthodox.

She made appearances in many of the most popular television shows of the 1960s before she landed her defining role as flower child Julie Barnes in the crime drama \"The Mod Squad\" (1968–1973), for which she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama in 1970.\n\nAfter \"The Mod Squad\", Lipton married producer Quincy Jones and began a 15-year hiatus from acting, in which she raised her two children, Kidada and Rashida Jones. She returned to acting in 1988, performing in many TV roles, including Norma Jennings in David Lynch's \"Twin Peaks\".\n\nMargaret Ann Lipton was born into an upper middle class Jewish family in New York City on August 30, 1946, the daughter of artist Rita Benson (born Rita Hetty Rosenberg; 1912–1986) and corporate lawyer Harold Lipton (1911–1999). Her paternal grandparents (surnamed Lipschitz) were from Russia, and her mother was born in Dublin, to parents from Latvia. Lipton was raised on Long Island with her brothers, Robert, who became an actor, and Kenneth. She attended Lawrence Junior High School and the Professional Children's School. Sexually abused by an uncle, Lipton was a nervous and withdrawn child with a stutter so bad that she was sometimes unable to say her own name. In 1964, the family moved to Los Angeles, where Lipton became what she called a \"Topanga Canyon hippie\" who explored meditation and yoga.\n\nLipton's father arranged her first modeling jobs in New York while her mother encouraged her to take acting lessons. At 15, Lipton became a Ford Agency model and enjoyed a successful early career. After she and her family moved to Los Angeles in 1964, Lipton signed a contract with Universal Pictures. She made her television debut at age 19 in the NBC sitcom \"The John Forsythe Show\" (1965). Between 1965 and 1968, she appeared in episodes of \"Bewitched\", \"The Virginian\", \"The Invaders\", \"The Road West\", \"The F.B.I.\", \"The Alfred Hitchcock Hour\", and \"Mr. Novak\".\n\nLipton starred in \"The Mod Squad\" as one of a trio of Los Angeles undercover \"hippie cops\". Appearing waiflike and vulnerable, as David Hutchings wrote, her performance as \"canary with a broken wing\" Julie Barnes earned her four Emmy Award nominations and four Golden Globe Award nominations during her tenure. In 1971 she won a Golden Globe Award for Best TV Actress in a Drama. Thin with long, straight, ash blonde hair, clad in mini-skirts, bell bottoms, and love beads, Lipton's Julie Barnes became a fashion icon and the hip \"it girl\" of her time.\n\nAfter \"The Mod Squad\" Lipton did no full-time acting for 15 years. In March 1988, she returned to television as the star of an ABC movie, \"Addicted to His Love\". She eventually regained major attention for her performance as Norma Jennings in David Lynch's TV series \"Twin Peaks\" (1990–1991) and subsequently appeared in many TV shows, including recurring roles in \"Crash\" and \"Popular\". In 2017 she reprised her character of Norma Jennings in the \"Twin Peaks\" revival. Also in 2017, she appeared in an episode of \"Angie Tribeca\" as the mother of the title character played by her daughter Rashida Jones.\n\nAs a singer, three of Lipton's singles landed on the \"Billboard\" charts: \"Stoney End\" (No. 121 Bubbling Under Hot 100, 1968, later a hit for Barbra Streisand in 1970) and \"Lu\" (1970), both written by Laura Nyro. Her \"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\" (1970) was written by Donovan. \"Stoney End\" is included in her 1968 album \"Peggy Lipton\" (Ode Records), which was released on CD on July 29, 2014 by RealGone Music, along with other singles and previously unreleased material (nineteen tracks in all).\n\nLipton and her husband Quincy Jones, along with Alan and Marilyn Bergman, co-wrote the 1984 Frank Sinatra hit, \"L.A. Is My Lady\".\n\nLipton was briefly linked with Paul McCartney. At age eighteen she began using drugs in an attempt to alleviate her depression. After Lipton married musician and producer Quincy Jones in 1974, she took a hiatus from acting to concentrate on her family (with the exception of appearing in the made-for-TV movie \"The Return of the Mod Squad\" in 1979). The couple had two daughters, Kidada (March 22, 1974) and Rashida (February 25, 1976), who both became actors. Lipton separated from Jones in 1986, and they divorced in 1990.\n\nLipton died of colon cancer in Los Angeles on May 11, 2019 after being diagnosed in 2004.\n\n\n\n"}

This composition is one of Chopin's most admired compositions and has long been a favorite of the classical piano repertoire. The piece requires exceptional piano skills and great virtuosity to be interpreted at a high degree of proficiency. It is also very physically demanding, and according to his student Adolphe Gutmann, Chopin played it more gently than most performers. The polonaise was dedicated to Auguste Léo, a German banker and friend of Chopin.\n\nGeorge Sand, Chopin's longtime lover and companion, responded vigorously to the Revolutions of 1848 as did many intellectuals of the day. When the 1848 Revolution began in France, women had fewer rights than men and Sand believed these were necessary for progress. Around this time, Sand started her own newspaper which was published in a workers' co-operative. This allowed her to publish more political essays, expressing her strongly felt convictions. In one of these, for example, she wrote, \"I cannot believe in any republic that starts a revolution by killing its own proletariat.\"\n\nOn hearing Chopin's Polonaise, Sand was left with a deep symbolic impression which she communicated to Chopin in their private correspondence. In one of their letters, she wrote passionately, \"\" (\"The inspiration! The force! The vigour! There is no doubt that such a spirit must be present in the French Revolution. From now on this polonaise should be a symbol, a heroic symbol\"). In spite of Chopin's reluctance to bestow descriptive names on his music, music scholars and concert pianists have nevertheless associated the grand architecture of the music with this sobriquet, \"Heroic.\"\n\nThe polonaise features many difficult technical aspects, including:\n\nThe tempo of the piece is \"Alla polacca e maestoso\" (\"like a polonaise and majestic\"). The form may be viewed as intermediate between ternary (A-B-A) and rondo (A-B-A-C-A), since the first interlude is much shorter than the second (16 vs. 74 bars). The main theme is preceded by an introduction of about thirty seconds in length.\n\nThe piece features a grand introduction with fast ascending chromatic notes in both hands, setting the mood of the piece; also, it shows the heroic side of Chopin's art. The first theme is a dance-like theme in the tonic key of A major. It is the familiar part of the piece and has the left hand moving in pounding octaves. The theme is repeated up an octave with short trills that fill some of the auditory gaps in the theme. The first interlude presents a series of chord progressions that lead into a recount of the traditional polonaise melody, with the polonaise rhythm employed in the left-hand accompaniment. The main theme then repeats once more.\n\nThe second, main interlude (or trio section) opens with six loud arpeggio chords before switching to a very soft bass ostinato of descending octaves first in the key of E major and then in E major (written as D major). A march-like melody follows the descending octaves and this occurs twice, and then a long lyrical interlude firstly with harmonic chord progressions and frequent modulations. This ends in a descending passage before the main theme is replayed. The theme is played louder and more dramatically and ends in a coda including material derived from the main theme. A typical performance of the polonaise lasts seven minutes.\n\nThe piece is written in a time marking but includes many implicit deviations from it. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2233015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233015", "title": "Cotiso", "text": "Cotiso\n\nCotiso or Cotison (flourished c. 30 BC) was a Dacian king who apparently ruled the mountains between Banat and Oltenia (modern-day Romania). Horace calls him king of the Dacians. Suetonius calls him king of the Getae. He is mentioned also by Florus, who wrote that Cotiso and his armies used to attack towards south when the Danube froze.\n\nSeveral scholars believe he is identical to Coson, a Dacian king whose name appears on many gold staters found in Transylvania.\n\nAfter the death of Burebista, the Dacian kingdom fell apart amid turnoil and civil strife. Cotiso appears to have emerged as the dominant figure in Dacia at this time, but nothing is known about his background. The new king found himself courted by the two Roman antagonists, Octavian and Mark Antony. Cotiso was in a strong position to dictate terms of any alliance to either of the conflicting parties. Octavian/Augustus worried about the frontier and possible alliance between Mark Antony and the Dacians, and plotted an expedition around 35 BC. Despite several small conflicts, no serious campaigns were mounted. Cotiso chose to ally himself with Antony. According to Alban Dewes Winspear and Lenore Kramp Geweke he \"proposed that the war should be fought in Macedonia rather than Epirus. Had his proposal been accepted, the subjection of Antonius might have been less easily accomplished.\"\n\nAccording to Appian, Antony is responsible for the statement that Augustus sought to secure the goodwill of Cotiso, king of the Getae (Dacians) by giving him his daughter, and he himself marrying a daughter of Cotiso. According to Suetonius, Cotiso refused the alliance and joined the party of Antony. Suetonius (LXIII, \"Life of Augustus\") says Mark Antony wrote that Augustus betrothed his daughter Julia to marry Cotiso (\"M. Antonius scribit primum eum Antonio filio suo despondisse Iuliam, dein Cotisoni Getarum regi\") to create an alliance between the two men. This failed when Cotiso betrayed Augustus. Julia ended up marrying her cousin Marcus Claudius Marcellus.\n\nAccording to Dio, the story about the proposed marriages is hardly credible and may have been invented by Mark Antony as propaganda to offset his own alliance with Cleopatra.\n\nAfter Augustus's victory in the civil wars, the Romans punished the Dacian ruler, who was apparently defeated in battle around 25 BC. In an ode dedicated to his protector, Horace advises him not to worry about Rome's safety, because Cotiso's army has been crushed. In his account of his achievements as emperor, the \"Res Gestae\", Augustus claimed that the Dacians had been subdued. This was not entirely true, because Dacian troops frequently crossed the Danube to ravage parts of Pannonia and Moesia. He may have survived until the campaign of Marcus Vinicius in the Dacian area c.9 BC. Vinicius was the first Roman commander to cross the Danube and invade Dacia itself. Ioana A. Oltean argues that Cotiso probably died at some point during this campaign. He may have been killed in the war. According to Jordanes Cotiso was succeeded by Comosicus, about whom nothing is known beyond the name.\n\nIn the 16th century a large number of gold coins were discovered in hoards in Romania. They were patterned after Roman coins, with a depiction of a Roman consul accompanied by lictors apparently copied from coins issued by Marcus Junius Brutus. The coins bore the name \"Coson\" or \"Koson\" written in Greek lettering. Theodor Mommsen argued that Koson was probably a Dacian ally of Brutus, since the imagery was taken from Brutus's coins. Recent scholars have argued that he is very likely to be identical to Cotiso, since \"Cotiso[n]\" is an easy transcription error for Coson. Horace always spells the name with an \"n\" at the end. Ioana A. Oltean, however, argues that Coson and Cotiso are different people, suggesting that Cotiso was Coson's successor.\n"}

Andrews (c. 1829 – June 7, 1862) was a Kentucky civilian who worked for the Union Army during the early years of the American Civil War. He led a daring raid behind enemy lines on the Western and Atlantic Railroad, known as the Great Locomotive Chase. Andrews and seven fellow raiders were caught at the end of the chase and executed by the Confederates on the charge of spying.\n\nAndrews was born in Holiday's Cove, Virginia (now Weirton, West Virginia). He moved to Kentucky, where he found employment as a house painter and singing coach. During the Civil War, he was engaged in buying contraband merchandise (including quinine) and smuggling it between the military lines. While serving as a secret agent and scout in Nashville, Tennessee, for Major General Don Carlos Buell in the spring of 1862, he devised a plan to take eight men to steal a train in Atlanta, Georgia, and drive it north. They would disrupt Confederate communications in western Tennessee and burn the long railroad bridge over the Tennessee River at Bridgeport. The mission failed when the required engineer failed to show up at the designated meeting place.\n\nIn April, Andrews proposed a new scheme to Major General Ormsby M. Mitchel to seize a locomotive in northern Georgia and drive it to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he would rendezvous with Mitchel's attacking Union Army. On April 12, 1862, Andrews, another civilian, William \"Bill\" Campbell, and 22 volunteers from three Ohio infantry regiments garbed in civilian clothes, stole a locomotive known as \"The General\" at Big Shanty, near Kennesaw, Georgia. They headed north, destroying tracks and telegraph wires along the way in an effort to discourage pursuers and render the railroad useless for supplying the Confederate troops in Tennessee. William Allen Fuller, the conductor of the stolen train pursued the train hijackers on foot, by handcar, and in a variety of other locomotives, most notably the \"Texas\", in which he gave chase for in reverse. After an chase, the \"General\" lost power just north of Ringgold, Georgia, and Andrews and his raiders scattered. He was captured soon afterwards and identified as the leader.\n\nHe was court-martialed in Chattanooga and sentenced to hang in one week as a spy. Andrews escaped from Swims Jail on June 1, but was quickly recaptured the next day. On June 7, he was taken to Atlanta ahead of the advancing Union army by train over the same tracks that he had used during the raid. Andrews was ineptly hanged at about 5:00 that afternoon (the scaffold was so low that his feet touched the ground and he most likely died of strangulation as opposed to the internal decapitation that causes death in a proper hanging), near the present day intersection of 3rd and Juniper Streets, NE. Andrews' body was temporarily buried at the site of execution. His remains were removed to the Chattanooga National Cemetery on October 16, 1887, and a gravestone and monument to the raid was erected near the Ohio Memorial (Section H, Grave No. 12,982).\n\nHe was engaged to Elizabeth Layton of Flemingsburg, Kentucky at the time of his execution. After learning of her fiancé's death, Layton became distraught and apparently never recovered and died two years later, her family believed of a \"broken heart\".\n\nThe first recipients of the Medal of Honor were made to military survivors of the raid. As a civilian, Andrews was ineligible for the Medal of Honor that was presented to most of the raiders.\n\nWalt Disney made a movie of Andrews' exploits in 1956 called \"The Great Locomotive Chase\" starring Fess \"Davy Crockett\" Parker as Andrews. Buster Keaton's 1927 feature-length comedy masterpiece \"The General\" was also loosely based on the incident.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2233048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233048", "title": "Murtaza Bhutto", "text": "Murtaza Bhutto\n\nMir Ghulam Murtaza Bhutto (18 September 1954 – 20 September 1996) was a Pakistani politician. He was the son of former Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and his Iranian Kurdish wife Nusrat. He started the militant organization Al-Zulfiqar after his father was overthrown and executed in 1979 by General Zia-ul-Haq. He moved to Afghanistan as a fugitive and was sentenced to death in absentia by a military tribunal.\n\nHe returned to Pakistan in 1993 and was arrested for terrorism on the orders of his sister, then-Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Released on bail, Murtaza successfully contested elections to the Sindh Provincial Assembly, becoming a vocal critic of Benazir and her husband Asif Ali Zardari. After increasing tensions between the two, he was shot dead along with six associates in a police encounter near his home in Karachi on 20 September 1996. Benazir's government was dismissed a month later by President Farooq Leghari primarily citing Murtaza's death and corruption. Zardari was arrested and indicted for Murtaza's murder, but acquitted in 2008. Murtaza's own faction of his father's Pakistan People's Party, Shaheed Bhutto, remains active in politics.\n\nBorn in Karachi on 18 September 1954, Bhutto received his early education at St. Mary's Academy. He later passed his 'O' levels from the Karachi Grammar School in 1971. In 1972, Murtaza went off to Harvard University where he took his bachelor's degree. For a period of time, he was the roommate of Texas gubernatorial candidate and former mayor of Houston, Bill White. In 1976, Bhutto graduated with his thesis entitled \"\"Modicum of Harmony\"\". His thesis dealt with the spread of nuclear weapons in general, and the implications of India's nuclear weapons on Pakistan in particular. Murtaza went on to attend Christ Church Oxford, his father's alma mater, for a three-year MLitt degree course. Bhutto submitted his master thesis, containing a vast argumentative work on Nuclear strategic studies, where he advocated for Pakistan's right to develop its nuclear deterrence programme to counter Indian nuclear programme. While in Europe studying for his PhD studies, Benazir Bhutto had notified Murtaza Bhutto about the \"coup d'état\" led by General Zia-ul-Haq. Murtaza, along with his siblings, returned to Pakistan immediately. However, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto advised his children to leave the country in the shortest time possible. Murtaza was on the verge of rushing home when he received a message from his father asking him to remain abroad where he could mobilise an international campaign for his release.\n\nMurtaza had been in Pakistan until Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's government was overthrown on 5  July 1977. Along with other family members, Murtaza had returned to Al-Murtaza, Larkana, and at the time was busy helping in the preparations for the elections scheduled for October 1977. But on 16 September 1977 when Ali Bhutto was arrested at Al-Murtaza, he asked his son to leave the country. After Ali Bhutto was sentenced, Murtaza joined hands with his brother, Shahnawaz Bhutto, to initiate a campaign to muster international support to revoke the death penalty looming over his father's head. Leaders from Syria, Libya, and the PLO were particularly supportive. Mercy appeals were sent by several heads of state to General Zia-ul-Haq; however, all these appeals were disregarded and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was executed. Murtaza and Shahnawaz both cut short their respective courses of study and decided to devote themselves to avenge their father's death. Eventually they resorted to taking up arms, their main target being Zia-ul-Haq. This marked the beginning of a new and more controversial era in Murtaza's life.\n\nHe fell in love with a Dari girl in Afghanistan, who became his first wife. He later married Gunwa Bhutto.\n\nLike his elder sister, Benazir, Murtaza Bhutto was a novice to active politics until 1978 when his father, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, was sentenced to death by the Lahore High Court. In the span of 15 years, however, Murtaza managed to gain considerable notoriety for a brand of politics that has moved in a direction that was diametrically opposed to Benazir's. Al-Zulfiqar was a leftist insurgency and militant organisation of Pakistan. It was formed in the late seventies by the sons of former Pakistani Prime Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was also the Chairman of Pakistan's biggest political party, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). Al-Zulfiqar was formed to avenge the execution of Ali Bhutto by the right-wing military regime of General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1976. Zia had deposed the populist Bhutto regime in a military coup in July 1977. Bhutto was hanged by the Zia regime after a closed military trial. Ali Bhutto's two sons, Murtaza and Shahnawaz went into exile in Afghanistan which was at that time controlled by communist revolutionary government of Babrak Karmal. There the two sons formed Al-Zulfiqar along with hundreds of Pakistan Peoples Party militants who had escaped Zia's persecution. The Al-Zulfiqar Organization (AZO) was born at this point, and disgruntled elements among the younger members of the PPP, disappointed in the party's leadership, flocked to Murtaza's side. The AZO, however, went on to earn the title of terrorist organisation due to its various terrorist activities throughout the country, a label which dogged Murtaza till he died. For his part, Murtaza always denied the charge that he espoused the politics of terrorism.\n\nAl-Zulfiqar hijacked a Pakistan International Airlines flight after and diverted it to Kabul in March 1981. From Kabul the journey went on to Damascus, Syria. The hijacking went on for thirteen days, during which Murtaza shot Major Tariq Rahim for being an Army officer. Rahim was executed following Murtaza's conferring with Afghan Intelligence (KHAD) chief Mohammad Najibullah. The Zia government had to accept the demands of the hijackers, releasing dozens of prisoners languishing in Pakistani jails and flying them to Tripoli.\n\nIn 2003 the case against Murtaza Bhutto and his brother was concluded quietly absolving them from blame relating to the PIA Hijacking, according to Fatima Bhutto's Book – \"Songs of Blood and Sword\". In the book, she indicates that the actual leader of the hijacking was Salamullah Tipu. Tipu had attempted to join the AZO in Kabul, but was rejected as the AZO supposedly never accepted those that came to them (in what was to be a futile effort to prevent infiltration). Murtaza Bhutto was supposedly only to hear about the hijacking when Tipu called him in Afghanistan from the hijacked aircraft.\n\nContrary to this, Raja Anwar in his book \"The Terrorist Prince\" paints a negative picture of Murtaza Bhutto. He writes that the idea to hijack a plane came from Murtaza Bhutto himself, who was 'obsessed' about the tactic after the Palestinians resorted to it in the seventies and eighties. Anwar tells of an excited Murtaza who, while he had early advised Tipu on taking the aircraft to Damascus or Tripoli went into pragmatic overdrive once the plane landed in Kabul due to a shortage of fuel. Anwar, after detailed conversations with Salamullah Tipu, which he recounts in his book tells of the role Najibullah played along with Murtaza in directing the hijack from the Kabul airport control tower. Raja says that while the hijackers had arrived into Kabul with only revolvers, they were soon furnished with semi-automatic weapons after Murtaza's successive meetings with Tipu under the 'belly of the PIA aircraft'. The most compelling account from 'The Terrorist Prince' tell of the treatment meted out to Major Tariq Rahim, who was ADC to Murtaza's father Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. Raja Anwar recounts the successive pleas (in the form of notes written on torn pieces of newspaper) Tariq Rahim made to Murtaza and Shahnawaz (Murtaza's younger brother) on account of his association with Zulfiqar Bhutto. These pleas according to one of the hijackers were delivered to Murtaza Bhutto, who not only discarded them, but instead instructed Salamullah Tipu to execute Tariq Rahim.\n\nThe books tells of countless stories of many activists who became fodder for Murtaza Bhutto in his quest to seek revenge for his father's judicial murder at the hands of General Zia-ul-Haq.\n\nAfter returning to Pakistan from exile , Bhutto offered his sister, Benazir Bhutto, the chance to revive the manifesto of PPP which his father championed. However, he was not happy with the ways of Benazir's husband Asif Ali Zardari and wanted him removed from influence in the PPP. When Benazir decided to side with her husband, Murtaza became a strong critic of the PPP government and the ongoing corruption. It is widely believed in Pakistan that this incident drove Zardari to rage and he used police machinery to assassinate Murtaza Bhutto. Benazir became highly unpopular after this incident and her limo was stoned by PPP workers when she tried to visit Murtaza's funeral ceremonies. After Benazir's government was dismissed in 1996, Zardari was detained for having a part in Murtaza's assassination. However, no charges were ever proven due to lack of evidence.\n\nJust before his death, Bhutto, 42, had verbally attacked the government. \"There would be trouble if the Police tries to arrest me without a warrant,\" he had declared.\n\nBhutto was sought by the police on the charge of inciting attacks on two CIA centres the previous Tuesday where it was thought that his party activist Ali Sunara was detained. \n\nOn Thursday, 20 September 1996 at 6:35 p.m., Bhutto, along with six other party activists, was killed in an encounter with police near his residence. Among the dead was Aashiq Jatoi, the acting provincial chief of the Pakistan Peoples Party (Shaheed Bhutto Group). Jatoi was a brother in-law of Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan. The injured list included six activists of Murtaza Bhutto's party and three policemen, including Superintendent of Police of Saddar area of Karachi and two other station house officers (SHOs).\n\nA Sindh government handout issued late the night of Bhutto's death said that Bhutto's vehicle was allowed to proceed to his residence by SHO Clifton after it was stopped. Bhutto's gunmen, sitting on the land cruiser vehicle, resorted to indiscriminate firing injuring Area Superintendent of Police (ASP) Saddar, SHO Clifton and a person in a nearby taxi. Other gunmen sitting in Bhutto's vehicle also started firing straight at the police. The police, under the command of ASP Drakshan and ASP Saddar, returned fire in self-defence, and after an encounter of 20 to 25 minutes, took control of the situation.\n\nThe police claimed that they reached the Bhutto's residence at number 70 Clifton, at 8:30 p.m., to arrest him. The policemen alleged that security guards, belonging to Bhutto and stationed at his house, opened fire, injuring several policemen. Return fire by the police party caused fatal injuries to Bhutto and his supporters.\n\nPolice said Bhutto's followers, who were in three cars returning from a party, fired first when asked to stop. Police returned fire, killing six people, all members of Murtaza Bhutto's faction. This was confirmed by the Deputy Inspector General of police Shoaib Suddle. Suddle further said that the police had insisted on checking the vehicles because of tightened security after two bomb blasts in Karachi on Wednesday, 18 September 1996, in which one person was killed and at least four others were wounded. The party activists who were wounded were identified as Dr. Mazhar Memon, Siraj Hyder, Ismail, Ayaz, Asghar and Bachhal. The policemen who were shot were ASP Saddar Shahid Hayat, SHO Clifton Haq Nawaz Sayyal, and SHO Napier Junaid. Two injured policemen remained unidentified. The injured were moved to the Aga Khan Hospital and Civil Hospital. Those who were killed with Bhutto were identified as Ashiq Jatoi, Rehman Brohi, Sajjad Hyder, Abdul Sattar Rajpur, Yar Mohammed Baloch and Wajahat Jokhio. The bodies reached JPMC Hospital at about 3:30 a.m. The police arrested 12 supporters of Bhutto and seized about a dozen AK-47 rifles from their possession.\n\nSome policemen who had stopped Bhutto's vehicle later claimed that they did not know whose car they had stopped. They said that they would not have opened fire on the motorcade had they known that it was Bhutto's. Others said that they had fired in panic and self-defence. Senior police officials were tight-lipped about the tragedy.\n\nSources said that after the incident the Rangers again cordoned off the area and searched the house.\n\nDr. Mazhar Memon, Senior Vice-President of the party's Hyderabad Division, blamed the police for opening fire on Bhutto without any provocation. \"We were returning from a public meeting at Surjani Town, District West of Karachi, when the police and Rangers stopped near the 70 Clifton,\" Dr. Memon stated at the JPMC Casualty Department. He said that Bhutto had exited the car to talk with the official. The policemen suddenly opened fire on Bhutto, seriously injuring him. Dr Memon said, \"I also came out of the vehicle to help my injured leader who was on the ground and I received a bullet in my leg.\" Dr Memon added that when Bhutto's guards saw him on the ground in a pool of blood, they rushed out and opened fire on the police. The policemen ignored Bhutto and continued firing. Memon added that when the firing died down, the Rangers who were on the spot jumped from their vehicles.\n\nSome eyewitnesses said that Bhutto, after getting out of his car, challenged the policemen to shoot him. A man was seen struggling for his life after being hit by police fire in front of the DIG police residence. The firing continued for half an hour, causing great panic in the area. Soon after the incident, when newsmen rushed to the hospital, they were beaten by highly emotionally charged policemen. The personnel of the law enforcement agencies cocked their guns and confiscated the cameras of photographers. One of the police officers ordered his force to open fire at journalists should they ignore his orders and advance.\n\nSources said that when Murtaza Bhutto arrived at the Mideast hospital in an official car, blood was oozing from his mouth. He tried to take off the oxygen mask but the doctors kept replacing it. Bhutto then collapsed and lost consciousness. At this time Bhutto's wife Ghinva and daughter Fatimah, both of them crying, reached the hospital. They were ordered out of the ICU, where the only official present was the Deputy Commissioner South, Arif Elahi. Soon the specialist doctors from Jinnah Hospital reached the Mideast Hospital. No anaesthetist was available at the hospital, which normally does not treat medico-legal cases. Murtaza was shot in his collarbone, chest, leg and abdomen. His body refused to accept a blood transfusion while he was being operated upon. Doctors revived his heart once when it stopped but failed to do so the second time. Murtaza Bhutto died at 11:45 p.m. but his death was not announced by the hospital authorities until 12:25 a.m.\n\nOn Saturday, the body was taken for burial by helicopter to Larkana, Sindh. The pilot of one of the helicopters which carried the body had difficulty in lifting the chopper as a number of supporters of Bhutto from Lyari, Karachi clung to the skids in a bid to board the aircraft. While the helicopter managed to lift off, many of the visibly moved supporters fell down. One, however, clung to the helicopter. The helicopter flew up to sea side and then returned and landed at Bagh Ibn-e-Qasim where the youth clinging to the helicopter's skid fell down and the chopper flew away.\n\nBhutto was laid to rest at the family graveyard in Garhi Khuda Buksh near Larkana.\n\nOn 3 December 2009, a sessions court in Karachi acquitted of murder twenty policemen in the Murtaza Bhutto case pertaining to an armed attack on a police team in which two officials were wounded and a taxi driver was also killed. The same court also pardoned six workers of the Pakistan People's Party Shaheed Bhutto in the same case.\n\nDuring the 13 years that the trial dragged on, a number of judges were appointed to hear the murder case. The change of judges is one of the many reasons behind the delay in disposal of the present case. Other reasons include a lack of interest of the prosecution witnesses and long adjournments sought by the counsel for President Asif Ali. The acquitted included Mazhar Memon, Asghar Ali, Asif Ali Jatoi, Mehmood Bhallai, Ghulam Mustafa Chandio and Akhter Ali Mirani. The police personnel acquitted include Shoaib Suddle, Wajid Durrani, Masood Sharif, Rai Tahir and others who were prosecution witnesses in this case.\n\n\n"}

She served as a commissioned ship for 22 years and 11 months.\n\nShe was laid down as AKA-116 on 3 April 1968 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Virginia; redesignated LKA-116 on 1 January 1969; and launched on 4 January 1969. She was sponsored by Leonor K. Sullivan, Representative from the 3d District of Missouri and commissioned on 22 November 1969 at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, CAPT John W. Klinefelter in command. USS St. Louis (LKA-116) was decommissioned on 2 November 1992 in Sasebo, Japan. From Sasebo the ship was towed to Pearl Harbor, HI, where she was kept in mothballs.\n\nFollowing commissioning, \"St. Louis\" was outfitted at Norfolk; and, on 3 February 1970, commenced trials. On 6 February, she was ready for sea and sailed for Long Beach, California, her home port. While en route, she conducted underway training for her crew, visited Fort Lauderdale, Florida, transited the Panama Canal and arrived at Long Beach on 28 February ready for two months of intensive training in battle organization and amphibious operations.\n\n\"St. Louis\" spent May and June in post-shakedown availability and the greater part of July in provisioning preparatory to her first deployment with the fleet. Late in July, she conducted her first dependents' cruise to familiarize the families of her crew members with her operations and capabilities. She got underway on 1 August with units of Amphibious Squadron 11 for Pearl Harbor.\n\n\"St. Louis\", with the squadron, reached Pearl Harbor on 6 August, refueled, and sailed on the 8th for South Vietnam. On 16 August, she was detached to proceed to Subic Bay and finally rejoined her squadron at Da Nang on 21 August. After offloading Marines and their equipment, she then proceeded to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, returned to Long Beach to transport a World War II midget Japanese submarine to the submarine base at Pearl Harbor; and moored to deep water pier in Da Nang Harbor on 11 October. After completion of a large redeployment operation involving over 2,000 Marines and 22,000 tons of equipment in Quảng Nam Province, \"St. Louis\" visited Hong Kong and then moved to Subic Bay in the Philippines to participate in large scale amphibious landing exercises during November and December.\n\n\"St. Louis\" completed the amphibious exercise in early January, spent 15 days in upkeep in Subic Bay, then headed north again for two months of shuttling men and cargo between Vietnam, Okinawa, and Japan. She departed from Yokosuka on 20 March 1971 and entered Long Beach on the 31st. After a month and a half stand down period in Long Beach and three more weeks of local operations and upkeep there, she returned to Vietnam, arriving in Da Nang on 24 June. She visited Hong Kong, 28 June to 3 July, then returned to Long Beach on 19 July. \"St. Louis\" remained on the west coast for the remainder of 1971 and for the first three months of 1972. During this period, she was engaged in refresher training, amphibious exercises, and upkeep.\n\nOn 31 March 1972 \"St. Louis\" headed out of Long Beach Naval Shipyard back to the picket line off the coast of South Vietnam, participating in the defense of Quảng Trị Province during the Easter Offensive on 24 May 1972. The \"St. Louis\" offloaded South Vietnamese Marines and US Navy SEAL squads during this assault, earning a campaign star, and later, in the 1990s, the Combat Action Ribbon. After seven months of transporting men and cargo between various bases in the western Pacific, she returned to Long Beach on Veterans Day 1972. She spent the rest of 1972 and all of 1973 on the west coast. She visited Acapulco, Mexico, in February, participated in DSRV operations in May and visited Portland, Oregon, in June for the annual Rose Festival. She finished out 1973 with availability periods, refresher training, and amphibious exercises. In mid-January 1974, \"St. Louis\" stood out of Long Beach to return to the western Pacific. As of May 1974, she was in port at Subic Bay, Philippines. 1981-1982 she sailed a West Pac Cruise leaving San Diego, to pick up Marines from MSSG-31. She sailed to several countries Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Africa, Freemantle, Australia, Okinawa, South Korea. She had a beautiful stop at Diego Garcia & was in the Persian Gulf when the hostages of our American Embassy in Tehran were released. A Battle E was awarded to the ship, and the Navy \nExpeditionary Medal was awarded to Sailors, and the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal was awarded to Marines. Captain D.R. \"The Snake\" Morris, (later RADM) was the Commanding Officer of the ship, and Major Bailey was the Commanding Officer of the embarked Marines. I was a member of the crew (USMC). \n\nThe \"St. Louis\" returned to her home port of 32nd Street Naval Station San Diego, California. In 1983 she changed home port to Sasebo, Japan where she performed troop transfers between Okinawa and Korea and amphibious ready group deployments until she was decommissioned in 1992.\n\n\"St. Louis\" would spend most of 1990 in repair and upkeep period. In May 1991, the St. Louis would participate in Operation Sea Angel in Chittagong Bangladesh after a powerful tropical cyclone struck the Chittagong district of southeastern Bangladesh killing at least 138,000 people and leaving as many as 10 million homeless. On 13 May 1991, Seventh Fleet ordered the USS \"St. Louis\" under the command of Capt. John W. Peterson, to proceed from Subic Bay in the Philippines to Naha, Okinawa Japan. At Naha, the \"St. Louis\" would load 28 reverse osmosis water purification units ( ROWPUs) each weighing more than 5 tons for use in the relief effort. The amphibious cargo ship \"St. Louis\" departed Okinawa on 19 May and arrived 10 days later on 29 May, off the coast of Chittagong, Bangladesh.\n\nAfter this, the St. Louis was released from their duties of a successful operation. Early on the 8th the St. Louis weighed anchor and steamed for Phuket, Thailand, where her crew was granted their first liberty in weeks. The \"St. Louis\" arrived in Phuket, Thailand on 11 June and would depart on 15 June. As the \"St. Louis\" left Phuket her tasking again was changed. On orders from the Seventh Fleet, the St. Louis was to make the best possible speed to Subic Bay in the Philippines. There the \"St. Louis\" would provide humanitarian assistance to the naval base and nearby Cubi Point Naval Air Station during Operation Fiery Vigil after the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo, followed by several days of torrential rains and severe earthquakes.\n\n\"St. Louis\" was involved in exercises off Pohang, Korea and Okinawa, Japan in 1991 and 1992. In May 1992, the St. Louis would make her final voyage to liberty ports Penang, Malaysia, Singapore, the \"St. Louis\" crossed the equator on 19 May 1992 at latitude 00.00 and longitude 106.01 East after departing Singapore. The St. Louis would make its way to Pattaya, Thailand and finally Hong Kong before departing one last time for Sasebo, Japan where the St. Louis was stationed. \"St. Louis\" was decommissioned and put in reserve on 2 November 1992. As of 30 July 2001 she was berthed at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility, Middle Loch, in Pearl Harbor. \"St. Louis\" was finally sunk as a target for Valiant Shield 2018 on 21 September 2018.\n\n\"St. Louis\" earned two battle stars for service in the Vietnam War.\n\"St. Louis\" earned two Battle E Awards during pacific theatre operations in 1981 and 1982.\n\n"}

Haswell studied at the Edinburgh Institution and the University of Edinburgh (M.A., 1877; BSc, 1878; D.Sc., 1887) where he won seven medals, and at the conclusion of his course gained the Bell-Baxter scholarship as the most distinguished natural science student of his year. Amongst his teachers were Thomas Henry Huxley, Archibald Geikie and Charles Wyville Thomson. He qualified for the MA and BSc degrees in 1878, and immediately afterwards, for reasons of health, went on a voyage to Australia.\n\nHaswell arrived in Sydney in late 1878 and soon began work in a small marine zoological laboratory at Watson's Bay. There he researched the collections from the \"Chevert\" expedition to New Guinea, and on the marine fauna of Port Jackson and the adjacent coast.\nHaswell was elected a member of the Linnean Society of New South Wales in April 1879, when he had already contributed five papers to the \"Proceedings\". He accepted a post as curator at the Queensland Museum in Brisbane, but moved back to Sydney after one year in the position. In 1881 he collected specimens along the tropical coast of Queensland as a guest on HMS \"Alert\". In 1881 Sir William Macleay arranged for him to give a course of public lectures on zoology. At the University of Sydney, he was appointed professor of biology in 1889.\n\nHaswell was acting-curator of the Australian museum for part of 1882, and compiled a \"Catalogue of the Australian Stalk- and Sessile-eyed Crustacea\" which was published in that year. In the same year he was appointed demonstrator, and later, lecturer, in the subjects of zoology, comparative anatomy, and histology at the university of Sydney. He was much interested in the fauna of the New South Wales coast, and especially in the Crustacea, Annelida and Bryozoa, but also did other work covering a wide field. When the Challis professorship of biology was founded in 1889, Haswell was given the position and held it until its division in 1913. In 1893 he published in the Macleay Memorial Volume \"\"A Monograph of the Temnocephaleae\"\", a group which retained his interest for the remainder of his life. He collaborated with Charles Hedley and Sir Joseph Verco in investigating the continental shelf.\n\nIn January 1898 appeared Haswell's best known publication \"A Text Book of Zoology\" (London) written in conjunction with Thomas Jeffery Parker of the University of Otago, New Zealand. Despite being over 1400 pages, the book was described by the authors as being \"strictly adapted to the needs of the beginner\". On account of Parker's death the second edition of this standard textbook, which appeared in 1910, was prepared by Haswell, as was also the edition which came out in January 1922. A fourth edition was released in 1928 and it remained a standard in Australian zoology courses for decades. He also published a \"Manual of Zoology\" in 1899 which was reprinted in 1908. In 1913 a chair of botany was created at the university of Sydney and Haswell became professor of zoology.\n\nHaswell resigned his office at the end of 1917 and was appointed professor emeritus. He continued doing research work until shortly before his death from heart disease at Sydney on 24 January 1925. In 1894 Haswell had married Josephine Gordon, daughter of W. G. Rich, who survived him with a daughter. Haswell was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, London, in 1897. In 1915 the Royal Society of New South Wales awarded him the Clarke Medal. In addition to the works already mentioned Haswell contributed a large number of papers to scientific journals. No fewer than 74 of these were published in the \"Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales\". He was a member of the council of this society from 1881 until his death, and was its president for the years 1891–2 and 1892–3. He was also a trustee of the Australian museum for 33 years.\n\nHaswell was shy and unassuming, with a quiet sense of humour and much appreciation of a good story. On vacation he was fond of fly-fishing and golf, but generally he was an unceasing worker, collecting himself the materials for his researches, and making his own drawings. The \"Text-Book of Zoology\" in which he had so large a share was an excellent piece of work, clearly written and concise, a remarkable piece of scholarship which in its own way could hardly have been excelled. Many generations of students in Great Britain, America and Australia, laid the foundations of their knowledge of zoology on this book. Haswell was himself a good and sound teacher, and at the time of his death, in four out of the six universities of Australia, the chair of zoology or biology was held by one of his former students.\n\nAmong the written publications of William Aitcheson Haswell are:\n\n\n"}

It was one of three spacecraft, along with the mother/daughter pair of ISEE-1 and ISEE-2, built for the International Sun-Earth Explorer (ISEE) program, a joint effort by NASA and ESRO/ESA to study the interaction between the Earth's magnetic field and the solar wind.\n\nISEE-3 was the first spacecraft to be placed in a halo orbit at the Earth-Sun Lagrangian point. Renamed ICE, it became the first spacecraft to visit a comet, passing through the plasma tail of comet Giacobini-Zinner within about of the nucleus on September 11, 1985.\n\nNASA suspended routine contact with ISEE-3 in 1997, and made brief status checks in 1999 and 2008.\n\nOn May 29, 2014, two-way communication with the spacecraft was reestablished by the ISEE-3 Reboot Project, an unofficial group with support from the Skycorp company. On July 2, 2014, they fired the thrusters for the first time since 1987. However, later firings of the thrusters failed, apparently due to a lack of nitrogen pressurant in the fuel tanks. The project team initiated an alternative plan to use the spacecraft to \"collect scientific data and send it back to Earth\", but on September 16, 2014, contact with the probe was lost.\n\nISEE-3 carries no cameras; instead, its instruments measure energetic particles, waves, plasmas, and fields.\n\nISEE-3 originally operated in a halo orbit about the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point, 235 Earth radii above the surface (about 1.5 million km, or 924,000 miles). It was the first artificial object placed at a so-called \"libration point\", entering orbit there on November 20, 1978, proving that such a suspension between gravitational fields was possible. It rotates at 19.76 rpm about an axis perpendicular to the ecliptic, to keep it oriented for its experiments, to generate solar power and to communicate with Earth.\n\nThe purposes of the mission were:\n\nAfter completing its original mission, ISEE-3 was re-tasked to study the interaction between the solar wind and a cometary atmosphere. On June 10, 1982, the spacecraft performed a maneuver which removed it from its halo orbit around the point and placed it in a transfer orbit. This involved a series of passages between Earth and the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point, through the Earth's magnetotail. Fifteen propulsive maneuvers and five lunar gravity assists resulted in the spacecraft being ejected from the Earth-Moon system and into a heliocentric orbit. Its last and closest pass over the Moon, on December 22, 1983, was only above the lunar surface; following this pass, the spacecraft was re-designated as the International Cometary Explorer (ICE).\n\nIts new orbit put it ahead of the Earth on a trajectory to intercept comet Giacobini-Zinner. On September 11, 1985, the craft passed through the comet's plasma tail.\n\nICE did a flyby of the comet nucleus at a distance of of the nucleus on September 11, 1985.\n\nICE transited between the Sun and Comet Halley in late March 1986, when other spacecraft were near the comet on their early-March comet rendezvous missions. (This \"Halley Armada\" included Giotto, Vega 1 and 2, Suisei and Sakigake.) ICE flew through the tail; its minimum distance to the comet nucleus was . For comparison, Earth's minimum distance to Comet Halley in 1910 was .\n\nAn update to the ICE mission was approved by NASA in 1991. It defines a heliospheric mission for ICE consisting of investigations of coronal mass ejections in coordination with ground-based observations, continued cosmic ray studies, and the Ulysses probe. By May 1995, ICE was being operated under a low duty cycle, with some data-analysis support from the Ulysses project.\n\nOn May 5, 1997, NASA ended the ICE mission, leaving only a carrier signal operating. The ISEE-3/ICE downlink bit rate was nominally 2048 bits per second during the early part of the mission, and 1024 bit/s during the Giacobini-Zinner comet encounter. The bit rate then successively dropped to 512 bit/s (on December 9, 1985), 256 bit/s (on January 5, 1987), 128 bit/s (on January 24, 1989) and finally to 64 bit/s (on December 27, 1991). Though still in space, NASA donated the craft to the Smithsonian Museum.\n\nBy January 1990, ICE was in a 355-day heliocentric orbit with an aphelion of 1.03 AU, a perihelion of 0.93 AU and an inclination of 0.1 degree.\n\nIn 1999, NASA made brief contact with ICE to verify its carrier signal.\n\nOn September 18, 2008, NASA, with the help of KinetX, located ICE using the NASA Deep Space Network after discovering that it had not been powered off after the 1999 contact. A status check revealed that all but one of its 13 experiments were still functioning, and it still had enough propellant for of Δv.\n\nIt was determined to be possible to reactivate the spacecraft in 2014, when it again made a close approach to Earth, and scientists discussed reusing the probe to observe more comets in 2017 or 2018.\n\nSometime after NASA's interest in the ICE waned, others realized that the spacecraft might be steered to pass close to another comet. A team of engineers, programmers, and scientists began to study the feasibility and challenges involved.\n\nIn April 2014, its members formally announced their intentions to \"recapture\" the spacecraft for use, calling the effort the ISEE-3 Reboot Project. A team webpage said, \"We intend to contact the ISEE-3 (International Sun-Earth Explorer) spacecraft, command it to fire its engine and enter an orbit near Earth, and then resume its original mission... If we are successful we intend to facilitate the sharing and interpretation of all of the new data ISEE-3 sends back via crowd sourcing.\"\n\nOn May 15, the project reached its crowdfunding goal of US$125,000 on RocketHub, which was expected to cover the costs of writing the software to communicate with the probe, searching through the NASA archives for the information needed to control the spacecraft, and buying time on the dish antennas. The project then set a \"stretch goal\" of $150,000, which it also met with a final total of $159,502 raised.\n\nThe project members were working on deadline: if they got the spacecraft to change its orbit by late May or early June 2014, or in early July by using more fuel, it could use the Moon's gravity to get back into a useful halo orbit.\n\nEarlier in 2014, officials with the Goddard Space Flight Center said the Deep Space Network equipment necessary to transmit signals to the spacecraft had been decommissioned in 1999, and was too expensive to replace. However, project members were able to find documentation for the original equipment and were able to simulate the complex modulator/demodulator electronics using modern software-defined radio (SDR) techniques and open-source programs from the GNU Radio project. They obtained the needed hardware, an off-the-shelf SDR transceiver and power amplifier, and installed it on the 305-meter Arecibo dish antenna on May 19, 2014. Once they gained control of the spacecraft, the capture team planned to shift the primary ground station to the 21-meter dish located at Kentucky's Morehead State University Space Science Center. The 20-meter dish antenna in Bochum Observatory, Germany, would be a support station.\n\nAlthough NASA was not funding the project, it made advisors available and gave approval to try to establish contact. On May 21, 2014, NASA announced that it had signed a Non-Reimbursable Space Act Agreement with the ISEE-3 Reboot Project. \"This is the first time NASA has worked such an agreement for use of a spacecraft the agency is no longer using or ever planned to use again,\" officials said.\n\nOn May 29, 2014, the reboot team successfully commanded the probe to switch into Engineering Mode to begin to broadcast telemetry.\n\nOn June 26, project members using the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex DSS-24 antenna achieved synchronous communication and obtained the four ranging points needed to refine the spacecraft's orbital parameters.\nThe project team received approval from NASA to continue operations through at least July 16, and made plans to attempt the orbital maneuver in early July.\n\nOn July 2, the reboot project fired the thrusters for the first time since 1987. They spun up the spacecraft to its nominal roll rate, in preparation for the upcoming trajectory correction maneuver in mid-July.\n\nOn July 8, a longer sequence of thrusters firings failed, apparently due to loss of the nitrogen gas needed to pressurize the fuel tanks.\n\nOn July 24, the ISEE-3 Reboot Team announced that all attempts to change orbit using the ISEE-3 propulsion system had failed. Instead, the team said, the \"ISEE-3 Interplanetary Citizen Science Mission\" would gather data as the spacecraft flies by the Moon on August 10 and enters a heliocentric orbit similar to Earth's. The team began shutting down propulsion components to maximize the electrical power available for the science experiments.\n\nOn July 30, the team announced that it still planned to acquire data from as much of ISEE-3's 300-day orbit as possible. With five of the 13 instruments on the spacecraft still working, the science possibilities included listening for gamma-ray bursts, where observations from additional locations in the Solar System can be valuable. The team was also recruiting additional receiving sites around the globe to improve diurnal coverage, in order to upload additional commands while the spacecraft is close to Earth and later to receive data.\n\nOn August 10 at 18:16 UTC, the spacecraft passed about from the surface of the Moon. It will continue in its heliocentric orbit, and will return to the vicinity of Earth in 2031.\n\nOn September 25, 2014, the Reboot team announced that contact with the probe was lost on September 16. It is unknown whether contact can be reestablished because the probe's exact orbit is uncertain. The spacecraft's post-lunar flyby orbit takes it further from the Sun, causing electrical power available from its solar arrays to drop, and its battery failed in 1981. Reduced power could have caused the craft to enter a safe mode, from which it may be impossible to awaken without the precise orbital location information needed to point transmissions at the craft.\n\nThe ICE spacecraft is a barrel-like cylindrical shape covered by solar panels. Four long antennas protrude equidistant around the circumference of the spacecraft, spanning . It has a dry mass of and can generate nominal power of 173 watts.\n\nICE carries 13 scientific instruments to measure plasmas, energetic particles, waves, and fields. , five were known to be functional. It does not carry a camera or imaging system. Its detectors measure high energy particles such as X- and gamma-rays, solar wind, plasma and cosmic particles. A data handling system gathers the scientific and engineering data from all systems in the spacecraft and formats them into a serial stream for transmission. The transmitter output power is five watts.\n\n\n\n"}

Durai, is a Singaporean who formerly served as the chief executive officer (CEO) of the non-profit health organisation National Kidney Foundation Singapore (NKF). The central figure in the 2005 National Kidney Foundation Singapore scandal, he was ultimately convicted for deceiving the NKF into paying S$20,000 to his interior designer friend, and sentenced to a three-month jail term.\n\nDurai and the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) sued Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) and its senior correspondent Susan Long over an article published in \"The Straits Times\" on April 19, 2004. Four days after the article appeared, the NKF served a writ on the newspaper.\n\nThe NKF objected to the first six paragraphs of the article, which carried an account from a plumber who worked on the attached bathroom of Durai's private office suite. The plumber said he \"lost it\" when he had to install, among other things, \"a glass panelled shower, a pricey German toilet bowl and a gold-plated tap\". The article said the taps were \"scaled down\" after Durai's outburst.\n\nWhen contacted regarding the plumber's story, the NKF responded that it was \"difficult for us to give an answer to enlighten your readers\" since the newspaper had not said who the man was. Durai had the gold tap replaced with a steel one the week after the article was published.\n\nThe NKF claimed that the paragraphs implied it had misused funds collected from the public and splurged them on its CEO's office; that it mismanaged public donations; that it had \"scaled down\" the installations only because the plumber protested; and that it avoided providing details on the alleged incident.\n\n\"The Straits Times\" argued that the alleged incident was true, and therefore justified publishing, and that the entire article was not defamatory but a fair comment on the lack of transparency and controversy surrounding the NKF.\n\nTwo days into the trial, which had been scheduled to last ten days, the NKF withdrew the defamation suits against SPH and the journalist.\n\nThe court was told that the NKF's reserves stood at S$262 million as of July 2003.\n\nSPH's lawyer, Davinder Singh, said during the trial that the NKF had been telling Singaporeans that its reserves would not last more than three years, according to statements made by its officials. He argued that if the NKF stopped all fundraising activities and concentrated on treating kidney patients, it would still have enough money to see through its operations for 30 years, based on its expenses scheduled for 2003.\n\nIn June 2005, the NKF had told \"The Straits Times\" that it needed about S$2,600 per month to support each of its 2,000 patients, a total of S$62.4 million per year. The charity cited those figures to bolster its argument that its reserves were not excessive. Based on its expenditure of more than S$60 million a year for dialysis, the reserves would last three years. However, on 12 July 2005, during the trial, the court was shown how the NKF in fact spent far less on dialysis than the public had been led to believe. According to its 2003 audited financial statement, the NKF spent S$31.6 million that year on dialysis and transplantation. Of that amount, S$22.9 million came from dialysis fees it collected from patients and a further S$1.5 million came from other related income. This meant that the NKF was out-of-pocket by only S$7.2 million.\n\nDurai initially disagreed with Singh, saying that no-one could be sure patients would continue to pay their share for the treatments. However, he finally agreed that the NKF's assertion that the reserves would last only three years was 'not accurate'.\n\nSingh noted that even if the NKF had to foot the entire dialysis bill of $31.6 million a year, its current reserves of S$262 million would last more than eight years.\n\nSingh argued that the NKF had overstated its patient numbers, and this would have given the impression to the public that more funds were needed to run its operations.\n\nIn May 2004, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan informed Parliament that the NKF had treated 1,414 patients in 1999 and 1,512 patients in 2003. A letter written to \"The Straits Times\" in April 2004 by Gerard Chuah, the chairman of its Children's Medical Fund board, had claimed that the NKF had 3,000 patients. Singh pointed out the number had been overstated by about 1,000. Durai said he realised there was a mistake only after the letter had been published, but had not corrected it.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Durai admitted that an overestimate had been made and not corrected. When asked why he had done nothing to correct it, Durai said, \"It was an oversight. I did not think it was of material importance. The donor gives us money because of the brand of the NKF and I did not think it was so important at that point of time to correct this error.\"\n\nSingh suggested that the number had been inflated to create a false impression of need. In fact, according to Khaw's statement in Parliament, the NKF's \"share\" of kidney patients in Singapore had dropped, from 54% in 1999 to 44% in 2003.\n\nDurai was paid a monthly salary of S$25,000 in 2002 and received 10 months' performance bonuses (S$250,000) for that year, making a total of S$550,000 for 2002. He was paid a monthly salary of S$25,000 and received 12 months performance bonuses (S$300,000), amounting a total of S$600,000 in both 2003 and 2004. He was paid a total of nearly S$1.8 million in three years from 2002 to 2004. These figures were closely guarded secrets until the trial. There were many occasions when he declined a pay rise but was paid the offered increase in salary, backdated to the time he was offered the pay rise, the following year.\n\nSingh said that Durai had tried to give the impression in his affidavit that he was being thoughtful when he agreed to come on board as CEO in 1992 for just $12,000 a month even though he had been offered $20,000. The truth, Singh said, was that Durai had agreed to the lower pay in exchange for freedom to earn extra income outside the NKF. Durai testified that his earnings were up to the board of directors to decide, admitting that he was unethical but arguing that he was not to blame for accepting them.\n\nNKF volunteer Archie Ong and aero-modelling instructor Piragasam Singaravelu, who claimed that they had seen Durai travelling in first class on airlines while making NKF business trips, were taken to court separately in 1998. Both apologised and paid damages and costs to the NKF after realising they were effectively fighting a losing battle against the unlimited monetary resources of the NKF.\n\nThe NKF, including chairman Richard Yong, had maintained that senior executives flew business class for long-haul flights.\n\nDurai told the court on 11 July 2005 that he did flew first class. For the past two years, he had been entitled to a fare equal to Singapore Airlines business class rate – the equivalent of first class on other airlines. Previously, he had paid the difference on his own.\n\nIt was revealed during the trial that the NKF had a fleet of eight cars with company drivers and Durai was one of six officers who could make use of them at any time. The office cars were also used to transport VIPs and guests of the charity. In his affidavit, Durai said that the office fleet was used by officers who had to visit NKF facilities to attend to the needs of the centres and patients. Durai also had his own Mercedes-Benz 200 for his personal and family use, and his wife also drove it. However, the NKF paid the car's road tax and picked up the bills for maintenance and repair.\n\nSingh questioned Durai on the cars. Durai said that, as CEO, he was entitled to use any of the cars any time he wanted. He also admitted that he had used the office cars for personal use.\n\nWhile Durai worked full-time as CEO of the NKF, he was also a director of a number of other companies. He was paid sums of up to S$25,000 a year by them, over and above his NKF remuneration package. He never told the NKF board about some of these, and did not list these directorships in his curriculum vitae (CV).\n\nIt was also revealed that Durai had a business relationship with Matilda Chua, a one-time employee of the NKF, who left to start her own company. Not only did he invest in her business, but the NKF also gave her telemarketing contracts, and she eventually became a member of the NKF board as well.\n\nWhen Singh produced Durai's CV and asked if it were complete, Durai answered, 'Not exactly.' He disclosed that he had once worked for a company known as Bonyad Marketing Industries, which he described as an Iranian charity, for S$7,000 a month. A December 1995 article in \"The American Spectator\" describes Bonyad Marketing Industries as a \"special arms trading company\" that had \"in addition to spare parts for Iran's U.S.-built F-4 and F-5 fighters ... been purchasing large quantities of Hewlett Packard and Sun SparcServer computers for use in Iran.\" Durai said that he was Bonyad's representative in Singapore from 1990 to 1992, but decided to give that up when he became NKF's CEO. Durai admitted that in 2000 he had invested in Chua's company, Global Net Relations, but did not disclose to the NKF board that he was a director of the company.\n\nSingh then probed him on the director's fees he had collected while he was working full-time as the NKF's CEO.\n\nDurai said he was paid S$25,000 a year each as a director of Amcol Holdings between 1990 and 1996 and an Australian company, Overseas & General, \"for a couple of years\". He also received \"some nominal sum\" as a director of MediaCorp TV Channel 12.\n\nSingh told him, \"The position is this: While you were expected to be and paid as a full-time CEO, you were earning fees outside NKF which were not disclosed to the NKF or to the public.\"\n\nDurai replied, \"That's correct. The NKF board gave me the liberty to do so.\"\n\nSingh continued, \"Mr Durai, your CV is yet another illustration of the lack of transparency with which you operate. You do not come clean on what you do, you do not tell the board what you do, how much you earn. You do not tell the board about your commercial relationship with a person who has a contract with the NKF. Is that transparency?\"\n\nDurai said, \"They were not very consequential, in my opinion.\" He said it was not necessary for him to disclose to the board and added that the directorships were \"just appearances\".\n\nJust after the trial, when Tan Choo Leng, patron of the NKF and wife of former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, was interviewed, she commented that \"$600,000 per year is peanuts compared to the reserves the NKF has.\" This then sparked the \"Peanut Controversy\", in which the public was irked by this comment. The public then called for her to apologise for this statement, which Goh Chok Tong did on behalf of his wife.\n\nIn the days following the trial, around 30,000 donors terminated their monthly contributions to the NKF. An online petition was set up, calling for Durai to step down, which, as of writing, has 43,589 signatures on it. The morning after the trial, the wall outside the NKF headquarters in Kim Keat Road was vandalised by an unknown person, most probably angered by the lack of transparency in NKF. Spraypainted all over the wall were the words 'liar'. On one wall, the words \"liar\" (骗子) and \"god of liars\" (大骗仙) were spraypainted in Chinese characters along with the Malay words \"Hang Turi\", the misspelling referring to Durai. The NKF signboard was also vandalised with the words \"liar\" spray painted in both English and Chinese. The graffiti was quickly painted over and the affected areas of the signboard was quickly covered up. These acts were severely condemned and police investigations were carried out.\n\nOn 14 July 2005, Durai and the NKF Board met with Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan to discuss the future and was told that 'business as usual' would not do. That evening, the NKF called a press conference, during which Durai and the entire NKF Board announced their resignations.\n\nAn interim board was appointed by the government to keep the organisation going and begin the task of restoring public confidence. Gerard Ee was appointed as interim chairman to oversee the restructuring of the NKF, and Goh Chee Leok took over the post as interim CEO.\n\nThe international accountancy firm KPMG investigated the business activities of NKF and issued a report on 16 December 2005, including the following conclusions:\n\n\nIt was reported that Durai spent much of his time reading at home and spending time with his wife, two sons and daughter. Before the KPMG report was out, his daughter wrote a passionate letter to the news media, pleading for the public to restore honour to her father. Durai had refrained from reading newspapers and watching television after the controversy.\n\nDurai said that he was prepared for the worst, referring to any legal charges that would be laid on him.\n\nIn an affidavit submitted to the High Court on September 7, 2007, Durai revealed that has secured a high paying job. He had accepted the position of CEO of a new subsidiary company under Singapore-based real estate management firm Property Facility Services (PFS) – a job that would pay him S$25,000 a month.\n\nDurai would be based full-time in Abu Dhabi after he had finished serving his sentence.\n\nDurai was formally accused of having submitted false invoices between 2003 and 2004 to the NKF to make claims for various consultancy services which were never rendered. One invoice was for S$20,000 and the other, S$5,000. Durai was said to have misled the charity by using the false invoices \"knowingly . . . with intent to deceive (the NKF)\". Anyone who uses a false or erroneous document, which to his knowledge is intended to mislead, is guilty of an offence under Section 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.\n\nDurai was released on bail of S$100,000, which was posted by his wife.\n\nOn June 11, 2007, Durai was found guilty of misleading the charitable organisation with a falsified invoice of S$20,000 which was allegedly for interior design consultancy work done by David Tan, the director of the design firm. The invoice, dated December 29, 2003, was meant for work done for various dialysis centres. For this, Durai was sentenced to three months' imprisonment on June 21. He could have been jailed for up to five years and fined S$100,000.\n\nIn 2007, Charles Letts, a former Jardine Mattheson & Co director, saved Durai from bankruptcy with a gift of S$1 million. Letts died in 2013.\n\nOn May 30, 2008, Durai lost the appeal as the presiding judge, Tay Yong Kwang, said that Durai \"was in a position of trust and authority at the NKF and the return of the money only came about after investigations into the invoices were underway.\" The judge added that the \"money in question belonged to a charity whose funds come from well meaning trusting donors\".\n\nDurai's sentence was maintained. However, the judge allowed Durai to defer his sentence to June 10, 2008 because his elderly mother went for a cataract surgery on June 3.\n\nA second charge, concerning the S$5,000 invoice, was considered on June 27, 2007. The money was allegedly paid to a company called Decision One International, in September 2003, for finding suitable candidates for a senior management position in the organisation. However, investigations reveal that no such service was rendered to NKF. The charge was later dropped.\n\nDurai was released from Queenstown Remand Prison on 11 August 2008.\n\nOn July 16, 2007, Durai was admitted to National University Hospital after contracting dengue fever. His condition was reportedly stable.\n\n\n"}

Again from her previous releases up to \"Let's Get to It\", the song was produced and written by Stock, Aitken & Waterman. The song was recorded in London, England, through the sessions of the album. The song was released as the album's lead single from \"Enjoy Yourself\" on 24 April 1989. \"Hand on Your Heart\" received positive reviews from most music critics, who deemed it a highlight from the album and praised it as a strong single.\n\n\"Hand on Your Heart\" peaked at number four in her native Australian charts, became Minogue's third number one in the UK Singles Chart, and made top ten in France, Switzerland, Finland and Japan.\n\nThe song was also performed on some concert tours performed by Minogue, including it on her Enjoy Yourself Tour, Rhythm of Love Tour and was featured on her and the \"Hand on Your Heart\" was known as one of Minogue's most well-known singles to date. The song was available as limited editions 7\" and 12\" posterbags featuring different artwork to the UK release in Australia. In 2006, Swedish singer-songwriter José González released an acoustic cover version of \"Hand on Your Heart\" as a single. His version peaked at number twenty-nine in the UK.\n\nThe song centers around themes of honesty and communication in a relationship. The song is sung in the viewpoint of a girl whose boyfriend is trying to break up with her yet she does not believe their relationship is over; she insists that he puts his hand on his heart and tells her until he really means it.\n\nMinogue re-recorded the song for her 2012 album \"The Abbey Road Sessions\", reworking the song to feature brushed drums and gentle piano which magnify the heartbreak and make the lyrics such as “Oh, I wanna hear you tell me / You don’t want my love” sound pleading, not defiant. \n\n\"Hand on Your Heart\" received favorable reviews from most music critics. Chris True from Allmusic highlighted the song as an album standout. Digital Spy gave it a favorable review, highlighting it by saying \"Put it this way... this piece is a wee bit late because it's hard to type while re-enacting the 'Hand On Your Heart' dance routine.\"\n\nThe \"Abbey Road Sessions\" version received extremely rave reviews from contemporary music commentators. Tim Sendra from Allmusic said that \"Stripping the songs down to their basics and then adding strings on top proves to be very effective, especially on “All the Lovers” or “Hand on Your Heart,” and most of the new arrangements are imaginative and sometime inspired.\" Nick Levine from BBC Music was very positive towards the reworked version of the song, writing that \"Who knew Stock Aitken Waterman tunes like [Never Too Late] and [Hand On Your Heart] had such melancholy lurking under the production chintz?\" Andy GIll wrote that \"Hand On Your Heart\", re-worked with a delicate, cyclical guitar figure augmented by a few telling piano chords, laid over a quietly shuffling snare whose gently scudding momentum allows the melody to glow at the heart of the song.\"\n\nOn 24 April 1989, \"Hand on Your Heart\" was released in the United Kingdom. The song became Minogue's third song to debut at number two on the UK Singles Chart, before it peaked at number one the following week. On its third week it was replaced on the top of the chart by the UK Hillsborough disaster charity single \"Ferry Cross the Mersey\" by The Christians, Holly Johnson, Paul McCartney, Gerry Marsden and Stock, Aitken and Waterman. \"Hand on Your Heart\" also topped the UK Dance and Indie charts.\n\nThe song was one of the first singles to sell well on cassette, selling 11,000 copies in the first week of release. This would have been enough to have Minogue enter in at number one, something no female had ever done at the time. However, PWL issued the cassette single at a cut price of £1.99, which was cheaper than chart regulations at the time allowed. This meant The Bangles stayed at number one with \"Eternal Flame\", with around 1,600 more sales. Because of this the rules were quickly changed so that cut-price cassette singles were allowed. The market for cassette singles stood at 0.5% at the time and the BPI hoped to encourage growth of the cassette single.\n\nOutside of the UK, the song was also successful. It reached number 4 in Australia and became Minogue's fifth top 5 single on the singles chart. In reached the top 10 in Denmark, Finland, France, Japan, and South Africa, and the top 20 in Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden.\n\n\"Hand on Your Heart\" featured a colourful music video that was directed by Chris Langman and filmed at Minogue's hometown in Melbourne, Australia in March 1989. The video features Minogue dancing in a modern house. She appears wearing a dress with a big heart on it that changes colour between vibrant colours of red, blue and yellow, Minogue travels from room to room, dancing playfully for the camera. A live version of the video was also released and featured Minogue performing a special \"live remix\" in Japan, both versions featured in \"Kylie's Greatest Hits 87-97 DVD\".\n\nAn alternate version of the \"Hand on Your Heart\" video was broadcast on UK TV pre-release, but has never been screened again. On this version Minogue's shoes spin on camera and introduce all three of her new outfits of matching colours. Only one \"shoe spin\" remains on the final version. Released to music video channels prior to the single's commercial release, the video was a hit, gaining significant airplay on music video channels. The video was released commercially on the \"Ultimate Kylie\" companion DVD, released in December 2004.\n\nThe first tour that \"Hand on Your Heart\" was performed on was the Disco in Dream/The Hitman Roadshow, as the original recording. It was then performed on the Enjoy Yourself Tour, which was launched to promote \"Enjoy Yourself\", the album from which the song is lifted. It began with an a cappella chorus intro before the original was performed. It was then performed the following year on the Rhythm of Love Tour as the original again. It was performed on the Let's Get to It Tour the year after as the normal version again. The song was then not performed until Minogue's 2000 tour: On a Night Like This Tour as the third song in the set. This version was not similar to the original and had a different sound. It was then performed on Minogue's in 2005 where it opened the sixth act: \"Kylesque\". It had a similar sound to the original but had different bass lines. This tour was cancelled due to Minogue's diagnosis of breast cancer. The tour was resumed under the name . \"Hand on Your Heart\" was also in this set list in the sixth act \"Pop Paradiso\", but closed this act. This was a new remix featuring a thicker bass line. More recently, the song was performed on Minogue's Kiss Me Once Tour to promote her twelfth studio album \"Kiss Me Once\". It opened the \"Dollhouse Medley\" which featured 4 PWL hits: \"Hand on Your Heart\", \"Never Too Late\", \"Got to Be Certain\" and \"I Should Be So Lucky\".\n\nThese are the formats and track listings of major single releases of \"Hand on Your Heart\".\n\n\n\n\nUK 12\" Remix\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2233095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233095", "title": "The Paper (film)", "text": "The Paper (film)\n\nThe Paper is a 1994 American comedy-drama film directed by Ron Howard and starring Michael Keaton, Glenn Close, Marisa Tomei, Randy Quaid and Robert Duvall. It received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song for \"Make Up Your Mind\", which was written and performed by Randy Newman.\n\nThe film depicts a hectic 24 hours in a newspaper editor's professional and personal life. The main story of the day is the murder of a couple of visiting businessmen. The reporters discover evidence suggesting a police cover-up of evidence of the suspects' innocence, and rush to scoop the story in the midst of professional, private and financial chaos.\n\nThe film takes place during a 24-hour period. Henry Hackett is the workaholic metro editor of the \"New York Sun\", a fictional New York City tabloid, who loves his job but the long hours and low pay are leading to discontent. He is at risk of the same fate as his editor-in-chief, Bernie White, who put his work first at the expense of his family. Bernie reveals to Henry that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer, and tries to track down his estranged daughter Deanne in an attempt to reconcile before his time is up.\n\nThe paper's owner Graham Keighley faces dire financial straits, so he has managing editor Alicia Clark, Henry's nemesis, impose unpopular cutbacks, as she schemes to get a raise in her salary. Alicia is also having an affair with \"Sun\" reporter Carl. Henry's wife Martha, a \"Sun\" reporter on leave and about to give birth, is fed up because Henry seems to have less and less time for her, and she dislikes Alicia. She urges him to seriously consider an offer to leave the \"Sun\" and become an assistant managing editor at the \"New York Sentinel\" (based on \"The New York Times\"), which would mean more money and respectability for shorter hours, but may also be too boring for his tastes.\n\nA hot story is circulating the city, involving the murder of two white businessmen in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Two African-American teenagers are arrested for the crime, which both Henry and \"Sun\" columnist Michael McDougal believe to be false charges when they overhear the NYPD discuss the arrest on the \"Sun\" office's police scanner. Henry becomes obsessed with the case, getting others from the \"Sun\" staff to investigate along with him. He blows his job offer at the \"Sentinel\" after he steals information about the case from the editor's notes while being interviewed for the job, reporting it during a \"Sun\" staff meeting. Martha discovers through her friend in the Justice Department that the businessmen were bankers who stole a large sum of money from their largest investor, a trucking company with ties to the Mafia. Henry begins to believe that it was a setup and the Brooklyn boys were likely just caught in the midst of it.\n\nHenry leaves a dinner with Martha and his parents to go to the police station with McDougal to confirm that the boys were not responsible before they print the story. They corner McDougal's police contact Richie, who, through repeated interrogation and the promise of anonymity, admits that the kids are indeed innocent and just happened to be walking by the scene of the crime when they were caught. Henry and McDougal race back to the \"Sun\" office to discover that Alicia has approved the paper's original front-page headline and story stating that the teens were guilty. This results in a physical fight between Henry and Alicia after he tries to stop the presses printing the papers with the wrong information.\n\nMcDougal is threatened by an angry city official named Sandusky, whom McDougal's column had been tormenting for the past several weeks. Their drunken confrontation in a bar leads to gunfire, which gets Alicia shot in the leg through the wall. Martha is rushed to the hospital for an emergency caesarean section due to uterine hemorrhaging. Alicia is brought to the same hospital and has a change of heart. She calls the \"Sun\" office, has the print room stop the run, and the headline is corrected to Henry's suggestion, \"They Didn't Do It\", with McDougal's story, just in time for the following morning's circulation. The movie ends with Martha giving birth to a healthy baby boy, and a morning news radio report states that because of the \"Sun\"s exclusive story, the Brooklyn teens were released from jail with no charges pressed.\n\nScreenwriter Stephen Koepp, a senior editor at \"Time\" magazine, collaborated on the screenplay with his brother David and together they initially came up with \"A Day in the Life of a Paper\" as their premise. David said, \"We wanted a regular day, though this is far from regular.\" They also wanted to “look at the financial pressures of a paper to get on the street and still tell the truth.” After writing the character of a pregnant reporter married to the metro editor (that Marisa Tomei ended up playing in the film), both of the Koepps' wives became pregnant. Around this time, Universal Pictures greenlighted the project.\n\nFor his next project after \"Far and Away\", Ron Howard was looking to do something on the newspaper industry. Steven Spielberg recommended that he get in touch with David Koepp. Howard intended to pitch an idea to the writer, who instead wanted to talk about how much he loved the script for \"Parenthood\". The filmmaker remembers, “I found that pretty flattering, of course, so I asked about the subject of his work-in-progress. The answer was music to my ears: 24 hours at a tabloid newspaper.\" Howard read their script and remembers, “I liked the fact that it dealt with the behind-the-scenes of headlines. But I also connected with the characters trying to cope during this 24-hour period, desperately trying to find this balance in their personal lives, past and present.”\n\nTo prepare for the film, Howard made several visits to the \"New York Post\" and \"Daily News\" (which would provide the inspiration for the fictional newspaper in the film). He remembers, “You'd hear stuff from columnists and reporters about some jerk they'd worked with ... I heard about the scorned female reporter who wound up throwing hot coffee in some guy's crotch when she found out he was fooling around with someone else.\" It was these kinds of stories that inspired Howard to change the gender of the managing editor that Glenn Close would later play. Howard felt the Koepps' script featured a newsroom that was too male-dominated. The writers agreed and changed the character's name from Alan to Alicia but kept the dialogue the same. According to David Koepp, \"Anything else would be trying to figure out, 'How would a woman in power behave?' And it shouldn't be about that. It should be about how a person in power behaves, and since that behavior is judged one way when it's a man, why should it be judged differently if it's a woman?\"\n\nHoward met with some of the top newspapermen in New York, including former \"Post\" editor Pete Hamill and columnists Jimmy Breslin and Mike McAlary (who inspired Randy Quaid's character in the movie). They told the filmmaker how some reporters bypass traffic jams by putting emergency police lights on their cars (a trick used in the movie). Hamill and McAlary also can be seen in cameos.\n\nHoward wanted to examine the nature of tabloid journalism. \"I kept asking, 'Are you embarrassed to be working at the \"New York Post\"? Would you rather be working at \"The Washington Post\" or \"The New York Times\"?' They kept saying they loved the environment, the style of journalism.” The model for Keaton's character was the \"Daily News\" metro editor Richie Esposito. Howard said, “He was well-dressed but rumpled, mid-to-late 30s, overworked, very articulate and fast-talking. And very, very smart. When I saw him, I thought, that's Henry Hackett. As written.\"\n\nThe director also was intrigued by the unsavory aspect of these papers. \"They were interested in celebrities who were under investigation or had humiliated themselves in some way. I could see they would gleefully glom onto a story that would be very humiliating for someone. They didn't care about that. If they believed their source, they would go with it happily.”\n\nIn addition to being influenced by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur’s famous stage play \"The Front Page\", Howard studied old newspaper movies from the 1930s and 1940s. Howard said, “Every studio made them, and then they kind of vanished. One of the reasons I thought it would make a good movie today is that it feels fresh and different.”\n\nOne of Howard's goals was to cram in as much information about a 24-hour day in the newspaper business as humanly possible. He said, “I'm gonna get as many little details right as possible: a guy having to rewrite a story and it bugs the hell out of him, another guy talking to a reporter on the phone and saying, 'Well, it's not Watergate for God's sake.' Little, tiny – you can't even call them subplots – that most people on the first screening won't even notice, probably. It's just sort of newsroom background.’”\n\n\"The Paper\" was given a limited release in five theaters on March 18, 1994 where it grossed $175,507 on its opening weekend. It later expanded its release to 1,092 theaters where it made $7 million over that weekend. The film went on to gross $38.8 million in North America and $9.6 million in the rest of the world for a total of $48.4 million worldwide.\n\n\"The Paper\" received positive reviews from critics and holds an 88% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 34 reviews with the consensus stating: \"Fast and frenetic, \"The Paper\" captures the energy of the newsroom thanks to its cast and director on first-rate form.\" \nAudiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F.\n\nIn his review for the \"Boston Globe\", Jay Carr wrote, \"It takes a certain panache to incorporate the ever-present threat of your own extinction into the giddy tradition of the newspaper comedy, but \"The Paper\" pulls it off. There's no point pretending that I'm objective about this one. I know it's not \"Citizen Kane\", but it pushes my buttons\". Peter Stack of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" wrote, “In the end, \"The Paper\" offers splashy entertainment that's a lot like a daily newspaper itself – hot news cools fast.” \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a \"B\" rating and Owen Gleiberman praised Michael Keaton's performance: \"Keaton is at his most urgent and winning here. His fast-break, neurotic style – owlish stare, motor mouth – is perfect for the role of a compulsive news junkie who lives for the rush of his job\", but felt that the film was \"hampered by its warmed-over plot, which seems designed to teach Henry and the audience lessons\".\n\nIn her review for \"The New York Times\", Janet Maslin was critical of the film. \"Each principal has a problem that is conveniently addressed during this one-day interlude, thanks to a screenplay (by David Koepp and Stephen Koepp) that feels like the work of a committee. The film's general drift is to start these people off at fever pitch and then let them gradually unveil life's inner meaning as the tale trudges toward resolution.\" Rita Kempley, in her review for \"The Washington Post\", wrote, \"Ron Howard still thinks women belong in the nursery instead of the newsroom. Screenwriters David Koepp of \"Jurassic Park\" and his brother Stephen (of \"Time\" magazine) are witty and on target in terms of character, but their message in terms of male and female relations is a prehistoric one.\"\n\nIn an interview, New York journalist and author Robert Caro praised \"The Paper\", calling it \"a great newspaper movie.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2233096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233096", "title": "Gilchrist Olympio", "text": "Gilchrist Olympio\n\nGilchrist Olympio (born 26 December 1936) is a Togolese politician who was a long-time opponent of the regime of Gnassingbe Eyadema and was President of the Union of Forces for Change (UFC), Togo's main opposition party from the 1990s til 2013. Olympio is the son of Sylvanus Olympio, Togo's first President, who was assassinated in a 1963 coup. He is now an ally of the current regime of Faure Gnassingbe, the son of the late President.\n\nOlympio was born in Lomé to a family of Ewe, Yoruba and Afro-Brazilian descent. He studied mathematics and philosophy in the United States, and in the United Kingdom at the London School of Economics and Oxford University, where he received a doctorate in economics. He worked at the United Nations in fiscal and financial studies from 1963 to 1964 and then as an economist for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from 1964 to 1970 and later returned to Africa to pursue business. Entering the Togolese political opposition, he was sentenced to death twice \"in absentia\" by the regime of Gnassingbé Eyadéma. Accused of plotting a coup together with various others, a warrant for his arrest was issued on 13 July 1979, but he could not be imprisoned because he was not in Togo.\n\nOlympio returned to Togo in July 1991 and participated in the Sovereign National Conference (\"Conférence Nationale Souveraine\"), which was held in July–August 1991. The conference put in place a new government and a transitional parliament.\n\nHe founded the Union of Forces for Change (\"Union des forces pour le changement\"), a federation of parties, on 1 February 1992. On 5 May 1992, his convoy was attacked in an ambush in Soudou, in the north of Togo; 12 people were killed, and Olympio himself was seriously injured, spending a year recovering in hospitals in France and the United Kingdom. Following the attack, Olympio lived in exile in Paris. An investigation by the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH) found that Eyadéma's son Ernest Gnassingbé was in charge of the commandos who perpetrated the attack.\n\nPrior to the August 1993 presidential election, Olympio rejected the choice of Edem Kodjo as the sole candidate of the Collective of Democratic Opposition (COD II), and on 23 July 1993, was designated as the UFC's presidential candidate. He was, however, disqualified from the election for non-compliance with medical certificates. He was a candidate in the disputed June 1998 presidential election, receiving 34.10% of the vote according to official results, in second place behind Eyadéma.\n\nOlympio claimed to have won the 1998 election, however, and demanded that the election be held over again; he also wanted the March 1999 parliamentary election, which was boycotted by the opposition, to be held over again. He initially refused to attend the Inter-Togolese Dialogue held in Lomé in mid-1999 due to security concerns, but on 26 July 1999 he arrived in Lomé from Ghana to participate. Although the dialogue involved many political parties, Olympio demanded exclusive and direct talks between the UFC and Eyadéma's party, the Rally of the Togolese People (RPT), regarding the 1998 election. This did not happen, and other opposition parties complained that they would be marginalized by such talks between the UFC and the RPT. Olympio consequently returned to Ghana after spending only hours in Togo.\n\nUnder the terms of a 2002 constitutional amendment, all presidential candidates were required to have lived in Togo for at least one year prior to the election. This created a legal barrier to Olympio's candidacy in subsequent elections, since he had been living outside of Togo since 1992. In 2003, Olympio was deemed ineligible to run in the June 2003 presidential election by the electoral commission on the grounds that he did not have a certificate of residency and a recent receipt of tax payments. On 26 April 2003, Olympio returned to Togo, saying that he did not have any taxable income in Togo. Olympio appealed the electoral commission's decision to the Constitutional Court, but it ruled against him on 6 May. Emmanuel Bob-Akitani, the First Vice-President of the UFC, ran in place of Olympio; Eyadéma won the election.\n\nAfter Eyadéma died in office in February 2005, Olympio said on 3 March 2005 that he had been chosen as the UFC candidate for the early presidential election that would be held as a result of Eyadéma's death. He was nevertheless barred from running, and Bob-Akitani again ran unsuccessfully as the UFC candidate in the April 2005 election.\n\nOlympio campaigned across the country for the UFC in the October 2007 parliamentary election; his campaigning including a visit to Kara, Eyadéma's native area, on 9 October, which was considered unprecedented. On election day (14 October) he was reportedly exhausted and unable to vote for health reasons, leaving another to vote for him.\n\nAt the UFC's Second Ordinary Congress, Olympio was re-elected as National President of the UFC on 19 July 2008; he was also unanimously chosen as the party's candidate for the 2010 presidential election. Olympio said on this occasion that he accepted the \"responsibility to lead the Togolese people to victory\", and he denounced the RPT regime, saying that it had brought Togo to ruin through four decades of mismanagement and repression. He ultimately withdrew his candidacy, citing health reasons, and was replaced by Jean-Pierre Fabre as the UFC candidate.\n\nIn 2010, in the aftermath of the presidential election, while the FRAC leaders and activists demonstrated for several weeks to claim victory for Jean-Pierre Fabre, Gilchrist Olympio signed a political agreement for participation in a government of national recovery in a spirit of power sharing with the ruling party. This agreement, which granted seven ministerial portfolios to the UFC, caused an outcry among UFC activists, who considered it treachery. This unilateral decision taken without consultation with the national office of the party caused a severe crisis in the party. After an unsuccessful attempt by Fabre and allies to eject Olympio from UFC, the National Alliance for Change (ANC) led by Jean-Pierre Fabre and his companions was created in October 2010.\n\nIn the aftermath of 2013 legislative election, Fabre's ANC emerged as the main opposition party when its coalition (\"Sauvons le Togo\") won 19 seats in the National Assembly. Olympio's UFC lost the electorate and won just three seats. Olympio remains President of the UFC but his standing in Togo's politics has become ambiguous, as he endorsed neither candidate in the 2015 presidential election.\n\n"}

The race finished on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, on 24 July.\n\n14 July 2005 — Briançon to Digne-les-Bains, \n\nThis Bastille Day stage saw a large breakaway with thirteen riders (top-ten plus Giunti Massimo, Stephan Schreck and Giovanni Lombardi) that gained over four minutes on the peloton. Included were the cycling sprinters Thor Hushovd and Stuart O'Grady. The escape was disorganised, with mostly Axel Merckx trying to set the pace and organise.

Lindsay detonated the bomb that killed himself and 26 other people on a train travelling on the Piccadilly line between King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square tube stations.\n\nLindsay was born in Jamaica; after moving to Britain at age five, he lived in Dalton, West Yorkshire, where he attended Rawthorpe Junior School and Rawthorpe High School. He subsequently moved to Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire.\n\nLindsay married a woman from Kinnitty, County Offaly, Ireland, in a traditional Islamic religious ceremony, which had no legal recognition in the UK. He divorced her eight days later in order to marry Samantha Lewthwaite. Lewthwaite, a native of County Down, Northern Ireland, had converted to Islam at the age of 15 after moving to Aylesbury. Lewthwaite lived with him and gave birth to their second child two months after his death. Lindsay had converted to Islam shortly after his mother, Maryam McCleod Ismaiyl, converted to the faith in 2001 and encouraged him to do the same. He worked part-time as a carpet fitter and supplemented his income by selling covers for mobile phones at a local market.\n\nAbdullah el-Faisal, a controversial imam convicted of attempting to incite sectarian murders in 2003, later claimed to have been close to Lindsay.\n\nLindsay's wife, Samantha Lewthwaite, denied his involvement until authorities produced forensic evidence to confirm his identity. She later said she abhorred the attacks and that her husband's mind had been poisoned by \"radicals\".\n\nBy 2015, she herself had been accused of causing the deaths of more than 400 people. Now dubbed the 'White Widow', Lewthwaite is an alleged member of the Somalia-based radical Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab.\n\nLindsay detonated his bomb, killing 27 people, on a train travelling between King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square stations. A raid by Scotland Yard found no explosives at Lindsay's flat. Lindsay is believed to have hired one of the cars left at Luton railway station on 7 July before the bombers made their rail journey to London. Abdul Dayan, the imam of the Jamia Ghausia mosque in Aylesbury, said that Lindsay did not attend, and did not mix with the largely Pakistani Muslim community. \n\nOn 22 July 2005, police and fire services were called to Lindsay's home in Aylesbury after neighbours reported a strong smell of petrol coming from it. It was suspected to be a retaliatory arson attack on the empty property. Later it was revealed in the local press that Lindsay's wife and son were living under \n\"police protection\" and would not be returning home. In December 2005, two 17-year-olds were convicted at Aylesbury Crown Court of arson in circumstances where they were reckless as to whether the life of another person would be endangered and each sentenced to 18 months youth detention with a training order.\n\n\n"}

These ships served in Amphibious Readiness Groups between 1968 and 1994. The ships were the last amphibious cargo ships built for the U.S. Navy, their role having been taken over by the San Antonio-class of amphibious transport dock.\n\nBuilt in the late 1960s, these ships participated in the Vietnam War. Four of the five ships in the class had been transferred to the reserve fleet in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The need for additional sealift capacity resulted in all four being returned to the active fleet in 1982. They are among the first Navy ships to have a fully automated main propulsion plant (600-pound pressure with superheat, known as a \"Super Six.\"). The lead ship of the class, was decommissioned in 1992, and was joined by in November 1992. The remaining ships were decommissioned in 1994. All ships are mothballed for possible activation in the future.\n\nThe assigned mission of the amphibious cargo ship was to transport and land combat equipment and material with attendant personnel in an amphibious assault. To optimize their capability for combat loading, they provided considerable flexibility in cargo stowage methods. The cargo elevators servicing holds 1, 3, and 4 make all categories of supplies and all levels available simultaneously to either the main deck or the helicopter platform. Use of the ship's forklifts and pallet transporters speed the maneuvering of cargo in the holds and enable delivery to various debarkation stations via the main deck passageways, which run the length of the ship. The arrangement and quantity of booms and cargo elevators make it possible to simultaneously embark/debark vehicles and cargo.\n\nVehicles in upper stowage spaces can be embarked/debarked through the hatches with cargo booms, while pallets are embarked/debarked in lower stowage spaces by elevators. The main deck hatch of hold 2 is unobstructed and can be opened for embarking/debarking of vehicles without the delay of unloading landing craft stowed on the hatch. Hold 4 is well suited for high priority cargo because of its direct access to the flight deck or main deck via elevator number 5.\n\n\n"}

The advertising campaign was one of the first to present a fictional character based on a live model amid impressionistic techniques.\n\nRail travel around 1900 was tough on the clothing of passengers. After a long trip on a coal-powered train, travellers frequently would disembark covered with black soot, unless the locomotives were powered by anthracite, a clean-burning form of coal. The Lackawanna owned vast anthracite mines in Pennsylvania, and could legitimately claim that the clothes of their passengers would remain clean after a long trip.\n\nTo promote this, the Calkins advertising department created, \"\"Phoebe Snow\", a young New York socialite, and a frequent passenger of the Lackawanna\". The advertising campaign presented Miss Snow as often traveling to Buffalo, New York and always wearing a white dress. Calkins said he based the campaign on an earlier series of Lackawanna car cards (advertisements displayed inside coaches) - \"All in Lawn\" - created by DL&W advertising manager, Wendell P. Colton. They had been built on a rather limiting nursery rhyme, \"The House That Jack Built\", and featured a nameless heroine dressed in white. For his new campaign, Calkins adopted a form of verse inspired by an onomatopoetic rhyme, \"Riding on the Rail\", that he felt offered endless possibilities. \n\nThe first advertisement featured the image of Phoebe and a short poem:\nPhoebe soon became one of the most recognized advertising mascots in the United States, and she began to enjoy all the benefits offered by DL&W: gourmet food, courteous attendants, an observation deck, even onboard electric lights:\n\nIn 1903, filmmaker Edwin Porter parodied the advertising campaign with his short film \"A Romance of the Rails\".\n\n\"Phoebe Snow\" was the only name Calkins ever used in the advertisements, and he laughed at later claims by Lackawanna officials that the name was selected only after lengthy scientific experimentation. The original artwork was painted by Henry Stacy Benton, who worked from a series of images of a model, Marion Murray Gorsch. Later, she was photographed in a variety of railroad activities while dressed in a white gown. Standing in for the cool, violet-corsaged Phoebe character of the paintings, Gorsch was one of the first models to be used in advertising.\nDuring World War I, anthracite was needed for the war effort and its use on railroads was prohibited, thus ending the career of Phoebe Snow. As she passed into legend, the Calkins heroine said farewell with the following jingle:\n\nOn November 15, 1949, the Lackawanna Railroad inaugurated a new streamlined passenger train named after its long-dormant promotional symbol. The new \"Phoebe Snow\" represented the modernization of the Lackawanna passenger train fleet, and its image. The new train became Train No. 3 (westbound) and No. 6 (eastbound), which previously had been assigned to the railroad's formerly premier train, the \"Lackawanna Limited\". \n\nThe \"Phoebe Snow\" ran on a daylight schedule between Hoboken, N.J., and Buffalo, N.Y., a trip of 396 miles (639 km), in about eight hours. The train was discontinued in 1966.\n\nSinger Phoebe Snow took her stage name from the character.\n\nThe 2014 oratorio Anthracite Fields commemorates the history of anthracite mining and, in its final movement, makes reference to the Phoebe Snow campaigns using original quotes.\n\n"}

It was also one of the first uses of edge-rails for a wagonway.\n\nUntil the end of the eighteenth century the City of Leicester had received its supplies of coal by packhorse from the Charnwood Forest coal mines around Swannington.\n\nHowever, in 1778, the Loughborough Canal opened up the River Soar from the Trent to Loughborough, and the opening of the Erewash Canal the following year allowed a ready supply of coal from the Nottinghamshire coalfields into Leicestershire at reduced prices.\n\nIn 1785, proposals to extend the Loughborough Canal south from Loughborough to Leicester were opposed by the influential Leicestershire coalmasters, even when a canal linking the mining area to the canal at Loughborough was also proposed. Gradually, however, they warmed to the idea and even came to consider a canal of their own linked to either Loughborough or the proposed Ashby Canal. By 1790 serious opposition to a branch canal from Loughborough to the coal field, known as the \"Forest Line\", had been won over and the following year the Leicester Navigation Company obtained an act of parliament to extend the Soar Navigation from Loughborough to Leicester, and to build the Forest Line.\n\nThe considerable height difference between Nanpantan and Loughborough would have required a number of locks, for which there was not enough water, so the canal terminated at Nanpantan where goods had to be transhipped onto a horse-drawn wagonway which connected to Loughborough wharf. The tramway was engineered by William Jessop who used an iron edge-rail railway, in contrast to his partner Benjamin Outram, who, for other such lines, preferred the traditional iron \"L\" shaped flange-rail plateway.\n\nWagonways also linked the other terminus of the Forest Line at Thringstone to the coal mines and to the limestone quarries at Barrow Hill and Cloud Hill.\n\nConsiderable difficulties were encountered in constructing both the Soar Navigation and the Forest Line, and it was not until 1794 that they were both opened.\n\nUse of the Forest Line was limited until the Blackbrook Reservoir feeder was finished. During the floods of 1799 this collapsed, destroying some earthworks and an aqueduct, and the canal went out of use for two years. Even after some repairs were carried out, further damage occurred and what little trade there had been did not return. Stevenson suggests \"\"the problems ... stemmed partially from the hybrid nature of its construction.\"\" That is, it was part canal, part wagonway. However, note that Griffin has suggested that technical, financial and legal problems at the coal mines served by the canal caused the amount of coal to be carried to be reduced to uneconomic levels.\n\nIn 1808 the company sought to abandon the Forest Line but were advised that this would require a costly act of parliament, so they turned this down, and the unused canal became derelict. In 1830 the Leicester and Swannington Railway was authorised, which greatly affected the transport situation in the area. The canal company was dismayed to receive a formal request by the Earl of Stamford that the Forest Line be put into good order to carry limestone. A proposal was drawn up to convert the canal to a wagonway or railway throughout and a bill was presented to parliament but was opposed and was not passed. The company tried to sell off the land of the canal piecemeal but this was deemed to be illegal without an act of parliament. In the end a landowner who wanted to buy some of the land agreed to pay for a private bill and the Forest Line was officially abandoned in 1846.\n\nIt was not until 1832 that the opening of the Leicester and Swannington Railway allowed the Leicestershire miners to regain a competitive advantage. The Nottinghamshire coal miners responded to this by proposing a railway line extending from the Mansfield and Pinxton Railway, which had been opened in 1819. This eventually led to the building of Midland Counties Railway, which became a founding partner in the Midland Railway.\n\nSubsequently the Charnwood Forest Railway (opened in 1883 and closed in 1963) took over part of the route of the Forest Line between Grace Dieu and Shepshed, including the aqueduct over the Blackbrook.\n\nRemains of the canal can still be seen in places, particularly: \n\n\n"}

He managed to pick up a fair education, which afterwards he constantly supplemented. In the revolutionary years from 1845 to 1850 young Parker as a local preacher and temperance orator gained a reputation for vigorous utterance. He was influenced by Thomas Cooper, the Chartist, and Edward Miall, the Liberationist, and was much associated with Joseph Cowen, afterwards MP for Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nAt the time, he was wooing a local girl – Ann Nesbitt, daughter of William Nesbitt, a farmer of Horsley–on–Tyne. He referred to her as \"Annie, the soul I loved, the girl that saved me, and made me a man\". Horsley was about ten miles from Hexham, and he became acquainted with the Nesbitts through his preaching there, and Mr Nesbitt, a trustee and deacon of Horsley Congregational Church was especially interested in the young preacher, who, on Sunday nights, brought them the news of the town and slept in a \"snug little chamber\" in the old farmhouse.\n\nAnn and Joseph were married on 15 November 1851 in Horsley Congregational Church, though Joseph was only twenty-one years old, and they had twelve years' happy married life – consisting of six months in Horsley, a year or two in London, five years in Banbury, and five in Manchester – until Ann died in 1863. However, when Horsley Congregational Church was rebuilt, Dr. Parker presented a beautiful stained glass window, bearing the following inscription: \"In ever loving memory of Ann Nesbitt, for twelve years the devoted wife of Joseph Parker, Minister of the City Temple, London, this window is reverently and gratefully erected by the man whose life she did so much to mould\". The pulpit of grained oak was given at the same time and was inscribed: \"In grateful memory of William Nesbitt of Horsley Hills, to whom the Church herein assembling is deeply indebted for long-continued and invaluable service, this pulpit is affectionately erected by his son-in-law Joseph Parker.\" Both the stained glass window and the pulpit can still be viewed at Horsley Congregational Church. The site is now managed by The Hearth Centre (Horsley) Ltd locally known as The Hearth – see www.thehearth.co.uk . Regular church services are still held in the church.\n\nIn the spring of 1852 he wrote to Dr John Campbell, minister of Whitefield Tabernacle, Moorfields, London, for advice as to entering the Congregational ministry, and after a short probation he became Campbell's assistant. He also attended lectures in logic and philosophy at University College London. From 1853 to 1858 he was pastor at Banbury. His next charge was at Cavendish Street, Manchester, where he rapidly made himself felt as a power in English Nonconformity. While here he published a volume of lectures entitled \"Church Questions\", and, anonymously, \"Ecce Deus\" (1868), a work provoked by Seeley's \"Ecce Homo\". The University of Chicago conferred on him the degree of D.D.\n\nIn 1869, he returned to London as minister of the Poultry church, founded by Thomas Goodwin. Almost at once he began the scheme which resulted in the erection of the great City Temple in Holborn Viaduct. It cost £70,000, and was opened on 19 May 1874. From this centre his influence spread far and wide. His stimulating and original sermons, delivered with a ready command of vigorous English, made him one of the best known personalities of his time. Dr. Parker exchanged a number of friendly letters with Spurgeon, and was invited to speak on Spurgeon's fiftieth birthday. One of Spurgeon's biographers, A. Cunningham Burley, makes an extended comparison between Spurgeon and Dr. Parker; Burley wrote, \"The wonderful thing is that these two men [Spurgeon and Parker], so strangely compounded, drew closer together as time went on. They learned (surely in the school of Christ) to praise each other's genius and to rejoice in each other's success.\"\n\nDr Parker was twice chairman of the London Congregational Board and twice of the Congregational Union of England and Wales. In 1887 he visited the United States, where he delivered a eulogy on Henry Ward Beecher, with whom he had been on very intimate terms. On 22 December 1864, Parker married Emma Jane, daughter of Andrew Common JP, banker, of Sunderland. Her death, on 26 January 1899, was a blow from which he never fully recovered. She was buried at the West Hampstead Cemetery. <https://flickriver.com/photos/12608538@N03/24630949862/>\n\nParker was commemorated by the Parker Memorial Congregational Church, which opened in November 1907 in Crowborough, East Sussex. The red-brick church, which cost £2,000, is now called the United Church and is used by the town's United Reformed and Methodist communities.\n\nOn his death (in London) he was succeeded as minister of the City Temple by Reginald John Campbell.\n\nParker's preaching differed widely from his contemporaries like Spurgeon and Alexander Maclaren. He did not follow outlines or list his points, but spoke extemporaneously, inspired by his view of the spirit and attitude behind his Scripture text. He expressed himself frankly, with conviction and passion. His transcriber commented that he was at his best when he strayed furthest from his loose outlines.\n\nHe did not often delve into detailed textual or critical debates. His preaching was neither systematic theology nor expository commentary, but sound more like his personal meditations. Writers of the time describe his delivery as energetic, theatrical and impressive, attracting at various times famous people and politicians such as William Gladstone.\n\nJoseph Parker's chief legacy is not his \"theology\" but his gift for \"oratory\". \"Charles Spurgeon\" praised his originality, writing, \"Dr. Parker's track is his own and the jewels he lets fall in his progress are from his own casket.\" Alexander Whyte commented on Joseph Parker: \"He is by far the ablest man now standing in the English-speaking pulpit. He stands in the pulpit of Thomas Goodwin, the Atlas of Independency. And Dr. Parker is a true and worthy successor to this great Apostolic Puritan.\" Among his biographers, Margaret Bywater called him \"the most outstanding preacher of his time,\" and Angus Watson wrote that \"no one had ever spoken like him.\"\n\nAnother writer and pastor, Ian Maclaren, offered the following tribute: \"Dr. Parker occupies a lonely place among the preachers of our day. His position among preachers is the same as that of a poet among ordinary men of letters.\"\n\nParker was pre-eminently a preacher, and his published works are chiefly sermons and expositions. Among them are:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the city centre, stops are served without a specific schedule every two or three minutes and since December 2005, extra long double-articulated buses have been used.\n\nHVV was founded on November 29, 1965, with the four initial partners the Hamburger Hochbahn AG (HHA), the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB), the HADAG Seetouristik und Fährdienst AG and Verkehrsbetriebe Hamburg-Holstein (VHH). The first results that the new organization delivered came on January 1, 1967, with a unified fare structure, pooling of receipts and coordinated systemwide timetables across all modes of transport.\n\nThe public transport authorities (PTAs) are also the tendering organizations and owners of the limited liability company Hamburger Verkehrsverbund (\"GmbH\"). The Free and Hanseatic city of Hamburg (85.5%), the State of Schleswig-Holstein (3%), the State of Lower Saxony (2%) and the Districts Herzogtum Lauenburg, Pinneberg, Segeberg, Stormarn, Harburg, Lüneburg and Stade (9.5%) are these PTAs.\n\nIn 2006 the HVV organised 27 rapid transit rail lines with a length of 881 km, with the following operators:\n\nThe following companies operate bus services for the HVV:\n\nThe HADAG Seetouristik und Fährdienst operates ferries on the Elbe river.\n\n\nThe unified fare system includes cash ticket sales (16%), season tickets (for week, month, or year) (72%) and disabled passengers, combined tickets, fare evaders, etc. (12%). In 2011, ticket revenue was €652.2 million. Cash tickets for one ride or the day can be bought at all railway stations, ferry slots or in all buses. There are also \"family tickets\" (for 2 adults and 3 children) or group tickets for up to 5 adults. The HVV offers travel passes ('ProfiCard'), and semester tickets for the students of all major universities, both heavily discounted. The HVV also offers tickets over mobile phones.\n\nMost tickets are not transferable to other persons.\n\nThe HVV offers a variety of types of weekly or monthly special fares.\n\nFor all public school pupils tickets can be bought at the company service centers. Other schools need to be registered by the HVV. The semester tuition for most universities include the ticket pass. Trainees and apprentices need be registered by the chamber of commerce to get a season ticket.\n\nAll children to the age of 6 are free of charge. For older children, seasonal tickets can be chosen.\n\nWeekly or monthly tickets for anybody 63 or older are sold at service centers.\n\n\n"}

It was typically deployed in the anti-tank units of armoured and motor rifle regiments to protect flanks against counter-attacks during rapid advances.\n\nIn 1970, it was replaced in production by the T-12A or MT-12 \"Rapira\", which features a new smoothbore gun, the 100 mm 2A29 gun, as well as a redesigned carriage and gun shield to protect the crew from machine gun fire and shell splinters. Thanks to the redesigned carriage, which has a bigger wheel base, the MT-12 can be towed by the MT-LB, at speeds up to 60 km/h on road or 25 km/h cross-country.\n\nThe 2A29R \"Ruta\" or MT-12R is a version with a RLPK-1 radar for engaging targets in a poor visibility environment (smoke/fog). From 1981, the gun could fire laser beam-riding guided missiles 9M117 Kastet (weapon system 9K116) and carried the new designator 2A29K \"Kastet\" or MT-12K.\n\nThe weapon was planned to be superseded by the 2A45 Sprut-B 125 mm smooth bore anti-tank gun. Modern western tanks' frontal armour protection is in excess of what can be penetrated by a 100 mm gun from anything but point-blank range – even using the most modern APFSDS round. For a tank that can manoeuvre to take advantage of the enemy's weaknesses this is less of a problem – but for a weapon that is primarily defensive, this is a serious problem. Today, the T-12 is applied mostly in the role of ordinary artillery, using FRAG-HE shells.\n\nIn 2017, the Algerian military displayed a locally developed variant mounted on a Mercedes-Benz Zetros truck. It includes four stabilization legs to absorb firing impacts.\n\nThe gun requires a crew of six: commander, driver of the towing vehicle, gun layer, loader, and two ammunition crewmen. When the MT-LB is used as the transporter, 20 rounds are typically carried (10 APFSDS, 4 HE-Frag, 6 HEAT). Since the weapon is a smoothbore, all the ammunition is finned for accuracy during flight.\n\nThe standard equipment consists of the panoramic PG-1M sight for indirect fire, and an OP4M-40U telescope for direct fire. The APN-5-40 or APN-6-40 are used for direct fire by night.\n\nThe gun can be fitted with the LO-7 ski gear for travel across snow or swampy ground.\n\n\"Note: penetration numbers for RHA at 90 degrees.\"\n\nAPFSDS-T Tungsten\n\nAPFSDS\n\n\n\n\nBeam riding laser guided projectile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Secreted proteins and extracellular parts of membrane proteins that pass through the Golgi apparatus may be sulfated. Sulfation was first discovered by Bettelheim in bovine fibrinopeptide B in 1954 and later found to be present in animals and plants but not in prokaryotes or in yeast.\n\nSulfation plays a role in strengthening protein-protein interactions. Types of human proteins known to undergo tyrosine sulfation include adhesion molecules, G-protein-coupled receptors, coagulation factors, serine protease inhibitors, extracellular matrix proteins, and hormones.\nTyrosine O-sulfate is a stable molecule and is excreted in urine in animals. No enzymatic mechanism of tyrosine sulfate desulfation is known to exist.\n\nBy knock-out of TPST genes in mice, it may be observed that tyrosine sulfation has effects on the growth of the mice, such as body weight, fecundity, and postnatal viability.\n\nSulfation is catalyzed by tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST) in the Golgi apparatus. The reaction catalyzed by TPST is a transfer of sulfate from the universal sulfate donor 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to the side-chain hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue. Sulfation sites are tyrosine residues exposed on the surface of the protein typically surrounded by acidic residues; a detailed description of the characteristics of the sulfation site is available from PROSITE (PROSITE pattern: PS00003) and predicted by an on-line tool named the Sulfinator . Two types of tyrosylprotein sulftotransferases (TPST-1 and TPST2) have been identified.\n\nThere is very limited evidence that the TPST genes are subject to transcriptional regulation and tyrosine O-sulfate is very stable and cannot be easily degraded by mammalian sulfatases. Tyrosine O-sulfation is an irreversible process \"in vivo\".\n\nIt has been shown that the sulfation of Tyr1680 in Factor VIII is essential for effective binding to vWF. Thus, when this is mutated, patients may suffer mild haemophiliac symptoms due to increased turnover.\n\nIn 2006, an article was published in the \"Journal of Biological Chemistry\" describing the production and characterization of an antibody called PSG2. This antibody shows exquisite sensitivity and specificity for epitopes containing sulfotyrosine independent of the sequence context.\n\n"}
{"id": "2233140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233140", "title": "Future Force Warrior", "text": "Future Force Warrior\n\nFuture Force Warrior was a United States military advanced technology demonstration project that was part of the Future Combat Systems project. The FFW project sought to create a lightweight, fully integrated infantryman combat system. It was one technology demonstration project in a series of network-centric, next-generation infantry combat projects the U.S. military have developed over the past decade, such as the Soldier Integrated Protective Ensemble technology demonstration program, Land Warrior, and Transformation of the United States Army.\n\nThe Future Force Warrior concept envisioned the radical use of technologies such as nanotechnology, powered exoskeletons, and magnetorheological fluid-based body armor to provide the infantry with significantly higher force multiplier than the opposing force. However, the stated concept was not U.S. Army doctrine, and was not intended to answer every situation that Army After Next (the Army's buzzword for future fighting forces) would face; rather, the concept was meant to serve as an end goal to strive to reach or to compromise with current technologies and to stir imagination and dialogue on how these technologies and concepts could help soldiers in the near future.\n\nThe first phase of the project involved a development of the technologies to help reduce the soldier's fighting load and power requirements and improving the soldier's protection, lethality, and environmental and situational awareness, with planned deployment in 2010, to serve the Army's short-term needs. The Army's plan was to introduce the subsystems in \"spirals\" every two years, instead of one large rollout every ten years. The U.S. military hoped to develop a fully realized end product sometime in 2032, incorporating research from U.C. Berkeley's BLEEX exoskeleton project and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies into a final design. This was one of the most important parts. The Army Combat Shirt was developed from this program.\n\nNett Warrior – named after Col. Robert B. Nett – replaced Land Warrior. Future Force Warrior was a futuristic research project with real deliverables folded into the Nett Warrior program. Situational awareness including the Rifleman Radio on every soldier, helmet-mounted display (similar to a HUD), location and Physiological Status Monitoring were the basic building blocks being implemented in increment 1.\n\nThe Headgear Subsystem was the situational awareness hub of the system. It was intended to include integrated tactical processing by providing maps, routes, and data with a 180° emissive visor display, high bandwidth wireless communications, microelectronic/optics combat sensor suite that provides 360° situational awareness, and integrated small arms protection.\n\nDescribed as \"Survivability Central\", was intended to contain a trio of layers, \"the Protective Outer Layer, the Power Centric Layer, and the Life Critical Layer.\" \n\nWPSM was intended to be an on-board physiological and medical sensor suite that would collect and monitor information regarding vital signs such as body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, hydration and stress levels, sleep status, body positioning and workload capacity of the warrior. If necessary, the WPSM can notify medics and commanders if the soldier has been wounded or has become fatigued.\n\nThe Microclimate Cooling System, built into the Life Critical Layer, would have been a network of narrow tubing to provide heating or cooling to the soldier, up to 100 watts.\n\nThe Power Subsystem, built into the Power Centric Layer, would be fed by the Duration Central, a 2 to 20 watt Micro Turbine fueled by a liquid hydrocarbon fuel pack. According to the concept, ten ounces of fuel would power the soldier's integrated electronics ensemble for up to 6 days. Polymeric nanofiber battery patches embedded in the headgear and weapon provide back-up power for three hours.\n\nListed under the Power Vision in the Advanced Technology Demonstrator, the current specifications ask for 24-hour autonomous individual operation and 72-hour continuous autonomous team operations, with a high density, low weight/volume, self-generating/re-generating, reliable, safe power source.\n\nAir Warrior was the U.S. Army’s next-generation aircrew ensemble, with the final product intended to provide life support, ballistic protection, and nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) protection in mission-configurable modules, and was under development with interoperability in mind. The system consists of components integrated to maximize safe aircraft operation and sustain aircrews throughout the flight environment.\n\nBlock 1 of the Air Warrior system provided an initial system capability including the development, procurement, and fielding of a micro climate cooling system, an integrated survival gear and ballistic protection system, improved over-water protective equipment, and a light-weight chemical and biological protection ensemble.\n\nThe ongoing Block 2 technology insertion program provided an Electronic Data Manager and an Aircrew Wireless Intercom System.\n\nGeneral Dynamics C4 Systems was the Block 3 Systems Integrator. The Block 3 system was focused on increasing force effectiveness by improving situational awareness and survivability with features similar to those of the Headgear Subsystem.\n\nThe Air Warrior Block 3 system was intended to be compatible with multiple helicopter types, including the CH-47 Chinook, OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, AH-64 Apache and UH-60 Blackhawk. Additional Block 3 capabilities were being defined through the requirements analysis and roadmap phase.\n\n\n"}

She was described by \"The New York Times\" as a \"contralto grounded in a bluesy growl and capable of sweeping over four octaves.\" Snow also sang numerous commercial jingles for many U.S. products during 1980s and 1990s including General Foods International Coffees, Salon Selectives, and Stouffer's.\n\nPhoebe Ann Laub was born in New York City in 1950, and raised in a musical household in which Delta blues, Broadway show tunes, Dixieland jazz, classical music, and folk music recordings were played around the clock. Her father, Merrill Laub, an exterminator by trade, had an encyclopedic knowledge of American film and theater and was also an avid collector and restorer of antiques. Her mother, Lili Laub, was a dance teacher who had performed with the Martha Graham group. She was Jewish.\n\nSnow was raised in Teaneck, New Jersey, and graduated from Teaneck High School in 1968. She subsequently attended Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois, but did not graduate. As a student, she carried her prized Martin 000-18 acoustic guitar from club to club in Greenwich Village, playing and singing on amateur nights. Her stage name came from an early 1900s fictional advertising character used by Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. In the railroad's print ads, a young woman dressed all in white emphasized the cleanliness of Lackawanna passenger trains. (Its locomotives burned anthracite coal, which created less soot than bituminous coal.)\n\nIt was at The Bitter End club in 1972 that Denny Cordell, co-owner (with Leon Russell) of Shelter Records, was so taken by the singer that he signed her to the label and produced her first recording. She released an eponymous album, \"Phoebe Snow\", in 1974. Featuring guest performances by The Persuasions, Zoot Sims, Teddy Wilson, David Bromberg, and Dave Mason, Snow's album went on to sell more than a million copies in the United States and became one of the most acclaimed recordings that year.\n\nThe album spawned a Top Five 1975 single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 with \"Poetry Man\" and was itself a Top Five album in \"Billboard\", for which she received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. The cover of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine followed, while she performed as the opening act for tours by Jackson Browne and Paul Simon. (She provided credited guest vocals backing Simon on the gospel-tinged hit single \"Gone at Last\" later in 1975—#23 on the Hot 100.) The same year, 1975, also brought the first of several appearances as a musical guest on \"Saturday Night Live\", on which Snow performed both solo and in duets with Simon and Linda Ronstadt. During the 1975 appearance, she was seven months pregnant with her daughter, Valerie. Her backup vocal is heard on Simon's hit song \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,\" along with Valerie Simpson and Patti Austin, from 1975. Both \"Gone at Last\" and \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\" appear on Simon's Grammy-winning 1975 album \"Still Crazy After All These Years.\"\n\nLegal battles took place between Snow and Shelter Records. Snow ended up signed to Columbia Records. Her second album, \"Second Childhood\", appeared in 1976, produced by Phil Ramone. It was jazzier and more introspective, and was an RIAA Certified Gold Album for Snow, with the Gold Album awarded on July 9, 1976. She moved to a more rock-oriented sound for \"It Looks Like Snow\", released later in 1976 with David Rubinson producing. 1977 saw \"Never Letting Go\", again with Ramone, while 1978's \"Against the Grain\" was helmed by Barry Beckett. After that, Snow parted ways with Columbia; she would later say that the stress of her parental obligations degraded her ability to make music effectively. In 1979, she toured extensively throughout the US and Canada with noted guitarist Arlen Roth as her lead guitarist and musical director. Her January 1979 cover of the Paul McCartney song \"Every Night\" reached #37 in the UK. In 1981, Snow, then signed with Mirage Records, released \"Rock Away\", recorded with members of Billy Joel's band; it spun off the Top 50 hit \"Games\". \n\nThe 1983 \"Rolling Stone Record Guide\" summed up Snow's career so far by saying: \"One of the most gifted voices of her generation, Phoebe Snow can do just about anything stylistically as well as technically. … The question that's still unanswered is how best to channel such talent.\" \n\nSnow spent long periods away from recording, often singing commercial jingles for AT&T, General Foods International Coffees, Salon Selectives, Stouffer's, Hampton Bay Ceiling Fans, and others in order to support herself and her daughter. Snow's voice was also featured on commercials for Cotton Incorporated and their The Fabric of Our Lives campaign in 1990s. During the 1980s, she also battled her own life-threatening illness. Snow recorded the theme song for the first season of the TV series 9 to 5. (Dolly Parton's vocals were used for the rest of the show's run.) Snow also sang the theme song for NBC's \"A Different World\" during the show's first season (1987–88).\n\nIn 1988, a duet with Dave Mason, called \"Dreams I Dream,\" reached #11 on the US adult contemporary charts. Snow returned to recording with \"Something Real\" in 1989 and gathered a few more hits on the Adult Contemporary charts. Also, Snow composed the Detroit's WDIV-TV \"Go 4 It!\" campaign in 1980. She sang \"Ancient Places, Sacred Lands,\"\"\" composed by Steve Horelick, on \"Reading Rainbow\"'s tenth episode, \"The Gift of the Sacred Dog\", which was based on the book by Paul Goble and narrated by actor Michael Ansara. It was shot in Crow Agency, Montana, in 1983.\n\nSnow performed in 1989 on stage at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City as part of \"Our Common Future\", a five-hour live television broadcast originating from several countries.\n\nIn 1990, she contributed a cover version of the Delaney & Bonnie song \"Get Ourselves Together\" to the Elektra compilation , which included Earth Wind & Fire guitarist Dick Smith. In 1992, she toured with Donald Fagen's New York Rock and Soul Revue and was featured on the group's album recorded live at the Beacon Theater in New York City. Throughout the 1990s, she made numerous appearances on the Howard Stern radio show. She sang live for specials and birthday shows. In 1997, she sang the \"Roseanne\" theme song \"a cappella\" during the closing moments of the final episode.\n\nIn 1995, Snow participated in \"\" at the Lincoln Center in New York City, singing a distinctive medley of \"If I Only Had a Brain; a Heart; the Nerve\". In addition, the concert featured performances by Jewel, Joel Grey, Roger Daltrey, and Jackson Browne, among others. An album of the concert was released on compact disc on Rhino Records as catalog number R2 72405.\n\nSnow joined with the pop group Zap Mama, who recorded its own version of Snow's \"Poetry Man\" in an impromptu duet on the PBS series \"Sessions at West 54th\". Hawaiian girl group Nā Leo Pilimehana also had a hit on the Adult Contemporary chart in 1999 with its cover version of \"Poetry Man\".\n\nIn May 1998, Snow received the Cultural Achievement Award from New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. She was also the recipient of a Don Kirshner Rock Award, several Playboy Music Poll Awards, New York Music Awards, and the Clio Award.\n\nSnow performed for US President Bill Clinton, First Lady Hillary Clinton, and his cabinet at Camp David in 1999.\n\nIn 2003, Snow released her album \"Natural Wonder\" on Eagle Records, containing 10 original tracks, her first original material in 14 years. Snow performed at Howard Stern's wedding in 2008, and made a special appearance in the film \"\" as herself. Some of her music was also featured on the . Her \"Live\" album (2008) featured many of her hits as well as a cover of \"Piece of My Heart\".\n\nBetween 1975 and 1978 Snow was married to Phil Kearns (who later came out as gay). She had a daughter, Valerie Rose, who was born with severe brain damage. Snow resolved not to institutionalize Valerie, and cared for her at home until Valerie died on March 19, 2007, at the age of 31. Snow's efforts to care for Valerie nearly ended her career. She continued to take voice lessons, and she studied opera informally.\n\nSnow resided in Bergen County, New Jersey, and in her later years she embraced Buddhism.\n\nPhoebe Snow suffered a cerebral hemorrhage on January 19, 2010, and slipped into a coma, enduring bouts of blood clots, pneumonia and congestive heart failure. She died on April 26, 2011, at age 60 in Edison, New Jersey.\n\n\n\n\n"}

At the current lake level, the reservation has only a small frontage on Walker Lake. The bulk of the reservation (72.68%) is in Mineral County; with portions in Lyon County (14.37%) and Churchill County (12.95%).\n\nThe reservation's land area is 529.970 square miles (1,372.616 km²). In the 2000 census, it had a resident population of 853 persons, and 746 persons in 2010. Schurz is the only town on the reservation. Wovoka, creator of the Ghost Dance important in the 19th century, is buried in Schurz.\n\nWeber Reservoir, an impoundment of the Walker River, is located upstream of Schurz and provides irrigation water for farms on the reservation.

Otherwise members had to travel excessive miles to reach a polling place. Early voting for the 2016 elections at Walker River reservation started October 22, and during the first two days, turnout nearly equaled the total of all voters in the 2012 presidential election.\n\nNative Americans in Nevada have become more politically active in presidential and other elections, as have those in other states. As part of that, they have been seeking more equitable access to polling places and treatment by county and state officials.\n\nLed by chairman Vinton Hawley of the Pyramid Lake Paiute, the Walker River Paiute joined in a successful civil rights suit in federal court against the state government to gain polling places on their homelands in 2016. They have had a discriminatory burden in the past by having to travel excessive distances to vote in elections. Walker River voters were enthusiastic after the victory, with early voting in the first two days on the reservation equal to the total votes cast by members of the tribe in the 2012 presidential election.\n\nHawley is chairman of the Inter-Tribal Council of Nevada. Many of their members have similar difficulties with access to polling places. On behalf of the Council, Hawley has \"urged Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske to direct counties to open [homeland] polling places for nine more tribes, including some where ballot boxes are 200-plus miles away, round trip.\" He also urged the Secretary of State for Nevada to improve conditions at local county polling places for urban Indians, who testified in the suit to being made uncomfortable at most offices.\n\n\n"}

He also did much to systematise the mathematical theory of mechanics and created several ideas critical to the development of modern control systems theory.\n\nRouth was born of an English father and a French-Canadian mother in Quebec, at that time the British colony of Lower Canada. His father's family could trace its history back to the Norman conquest when it acquired land at Routh near Beverley, Yorkshire. His mother's family, the Taschereau family, was well-established in Quebec, tracing their ancestry back to the early days of the French colony. His parents were Sir Randolph Isham Routh (1782–1858) and his second wife, Marie Louise Taschereau (1810–1891). Sir Randolph was Commissary General of the British Army 1826, Chairman of the Irish Famine Relief Commission (1845–48) and Deputy Commissary General at the Battle of Waterloo, and Marie Louise was the daughter of Judge Jean-Thomas Taschereau and the sister of Judge Jean-Thomas and Cardinal Elzéar-Alexandre Taschereau.\n\nRouth came to England aged eleven and attended University College School and then entered University College, London in 1847, having won a scholarship. There he studied under Augustus De Morgan, whose influence led to Routh to decide on a career in mathematics.\n\nRouth obtained his BA (1849) and MA (1853) in London. He attended Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he was taught by Isaac Todhunter and coached by \"senior wrangler maker\" William Hopkins. In 1854, Routh graduated just above James Clerk Maxwell, as Senior Wrangler, sharing the Smith's prize with him. Routh was elected fellow of Peterhouse in 1856.\n\nOn graduation, Routh took up work as a private mathematics tutor in Cambridge and took on the pupils of William John Steele during the latter's fatal illness, though insisting that Steele take the fees. Routh inherited Steele's pupils, going on to establish an unbeaten record as a coach. He coached over 600 pupils between 1855 and 1888, 28 of them making Senior wrangler, as to Hopkins' 17 with 43 of his pupils winning Smith's Prize.\n\nRouth worked conscientiously and systematically, taking rigidly timetabled classes of ten pupils during the day and spending the evenings preparing extra material for the ablest men. \"His lectures were enlivened by mathematical jokes of a rather heavy kind.\"\n\nRouth was a staunch defender of the Cambridge competitive system and despaired when the university started to publish examination results in alphabetical order, observing \"They will want to run the Derby alphabetically next\".\n\nAstronomer Royal George Biddell Airy sought to entice Routh to work at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. Though Airy did not succeed, at Greenwich Routh met Airy's eldest daughter Hilda (1840–1916) whom he married in 1864. At the time, the university had a celibacy requirement, forcing Routh to vacate his fellowship and move out of Peterhouse. On the reformation of the college statutes, removing the celibacy requirement, Routh was the first person elected to an honorary fellowship by Peterhouse. The couple had five sons and a daughter. Routh was a \"kindly man and a good conversationalist with friends, but with strangers he was shy and reserved.\"\n\n\nRouth collaborated with Henry Brougham on the \"Analytical View of Sir Isaac Newton's Principia\" (1855). He published a textbook, \"Dynamics of a System of Rigid Bodies\" (1860, 6th ed. 1897) in which he did much to define and systematise the modern mathematical approach to mechanics. This influenced Felix Klein and Arnold Sommerfeld. In fact, Klein arranged the German translation. It also did much to influence William Thomson and Peter Guthrie Tait's \"Treatise on Natural Philosophy\" (1867). The Routhian, which can be obtained from the Lagrangian by the Legendre transform, in classical mechanics is named in his honour.\n\nIn addition to his intensive work in teaching and writing, which had a persistent effect on the presentation of mathematical physics, he also contributed original research such as the Routh–Hurwitz theorem.\n\nCentral tenets of modern control systems theory relied upon the Routh stability criterion (though nowadays due to modern computers it is not as important), an application of Sturm's theorem to evaluate Cauchy indices through the use of the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n\n\n"}

She was born in Beijing to a Peking opera family. She is the daughter of late Master Yu Jim Yuen who ran the \"China Drama Academy\", a Peking Opera School in Hong Kong, and teacher of many well-known actors.\n\nShe started her acting career in 1948 and made over 240 films in the wuxia, kung fu, action, detective and Cantonese opera genres. Her films were successful at the box-office and she was one of the most popular superstars of the 1960 in Asia and Hong Kong.\n\nYu learned Peking Opera at the age of eight and made her stage debut at the age of nine. She specialized in playing female warrior roles in which she could skillfully demonstrate her footwork by continuously juggling and kicking back twelve red-tasselled \"tuo shou\" (脫手) spears, as seen in one of her famous stage Peking operas, \"The White Snake\" (白蛇傳), and in the 1951 film \"Amazon on the Sea\" (海上女霸王).\n\nHer first movie was made in 1948. She was one of the three actresses in the 1950s who really knew martial arts. Off the screen, she was virtually a heroine: at the age of sixteen, she alone successfully fought off a group of gangsters with only a silky belt on the streets of Shanghai.\n\nHer early wuxia pictures from 1948-57 were in both Mandarin and Cantonese dialogue, with stories intended to increase cooperation of the Northern Style and Southern Style of martial arts, as seen in \"The heroine of deadly darts\" (女俠響尾追魂鏢) in 1956. These remarkable wuxia films were mostly based on kung fu novels, e.g. \"Burning of the Red Lotus Monastery Pt 1 & Pt 2\" (火燒紅蓮寺) in 1950, \"The Golden Hairpin Pt 1 & Pt 3\" (碧血金釵) in 1963, \"Buddha’s Palm\" (如來神掌), a four-part film, in 1964 and \"The Burning of Pingyang City\" (火燒平陽城) in 1965.\n\nHer performances in Cantonese opera were quite different; she brought in a mixture of Peking Opera, in which she performed a lot of footwork, as in \"Suet Ting Shan and Fan Lai Hua - Meeting on the Weedy River\" (蘆花河會母) in 1961, \"Giving birth on the bridge – the White serpent\" (斷橋產子) in 1962 and \"How Zhong Wuyan Conquered the West\" (鍾無艷掛帥征西) in 1962. She also played a male lead as seen in movies \"Execution of Lui Po\" at Pak Moon Lau (白門樓斬呂布) in 1961, \"Two hunters in a pursuit\" (文武狀元爭彩鳳) in 1962 and \"The beauties\" (陣陣美人威) in 1964.\n\nApart from action films, she did a few rare contemporary and melodrama films, for example \"Midsummer night’s romance\" (夏夜之戀) in 1953, \"Bachelors beware\" (溫柔鄉) in 1960 and \"Two mouthy ladies from the north and south\" (南北鐵咀雞) in 1965. Her golden age of filming was between 1963 and 1966, when she made at least thirty movies in a year. Her surprise roles in \"The big revenge part 1 and 2\" (灕江河畔血海仇) (1963) and \"Heaven, Hell and Crystal Palace\" (天堂地獄水晶宮) (1965) did not destroy her popularity nor upset her fans; instead they won the hearts of the audience. Her last major movie was filmed in Taiwan (\"Decree of the fire dragon\" (血火龍令) in 1968) and she made a guest appearance in \"Secret agent no.1\" (神探一號) in 1970.\n\nIn 2004, Yu was one of the celebrities honoured on the Avenue of Stars, Hong Kong. To date, Yu still holds the record among actresses of making more than 170 wuxia movies.\n\nYu ended her acting career after she married, in 1966, Mak Bing-wing (; 1915–1984), a Chinese actor active in Cantonese opera. Mak Bing-wing began his acting career in the 1930s. He left Hong Kong in 1941 for a tour of the United States, returning in 1947 after the Pacific War had ended.\n\nWhile in the United States, Mak appeared in numerous Grandview Film Company productions.\n\nYu So-chow was his second wife. They had three children and later moved to the United States, where she died of pneumonia on 12 May 2017 in San Francisco, California, aged 86.\n\n\n"}

He provides English commentary for Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA) pay-per-view (PPV) events in Mexico. He also wrestles on the United States independent circuit. He is best known for his time in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as both a wrestler and commentator. He also recently has done commentary for Lucha Underground and Major League Wrestling. Striker works as a television producer and director and he was once ranked #166 in Pro Wrestling Illustrated's Top 500 wrestlers in the world.\n\nKaye originally worked as a high-school teacher while beginning a career in professional wrestling. He joined WWE in mid-2005. His wrestling character drew inspiration from his previous job, as Kaye, now calling himself Matt Striker, quickly developed the persona of a heel (villainous) teacher. In 2008, Striker began working as a color commentator for WWE's ECW brand and then SmackDown brand. After leaving the WWE in 2013, he worked on the independent circuit before joining Lucha Underground as a commentator.\n\nAfter training with Johnny Rodz, Kaye began working on the American independent circuit. While working full-time as a teacher in 2004, he continued to wrestle during his vacation time and weekends, while also using sick days. On December 16, 2004, Striker began a tour of Japan with Pro Wrestling Zero1 and was later invited back for an extended tour in early 2005. After resigning from his teaching position, he continued to wrestle around New York, and on April 30, 2005, won the New York Wrestling Connection (NYWC)'s Heavyweight Championship by defeating Mike Mondo. A few weeks later, on May 21, while still the Heavyweight Champion, he defeated Joey Braggiol to win the NYWC Interstate Championship, but only held the championship for two weeks, before losing it back to Braggiol on June 4. He made a few appearances for Ring of Honor in mid-2005, before returning to NYWC to lose the Heavyweight Championship to Jerry Lynn on July 30, after holding it for four months. He continued to wrestle for independent promotions throughout mid-2005, until he signed a contract with WWE.\n\nKaye, using the name Matt Martel, wrestled Kurt Angle in an invitational match on the February 24, 2005 episode of \"SmackDown!\" in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After the revelation that Kaye was a teacher appeared in mainstream news publications, Kaye made a WWE second appearance on the July 11, 2005 episode of \"Raw\" to face Angle for a second time. His news coverage was played up by Angle, who once again defeated Kaye. The following week, Angle defeated him for the third consecutive time. Kaye, now known as Matt Striker, went on to compete on \"Heat\" and appear in WWE's developmental territory, Deep South Wrestling.\n\nStriker developed a heel (villainous) teacher persona and beginning on December 12, hosted a segment called \"Matt Striker's Classroom\" on \"Raw\". During the segments, he ridiculed the audience and treated the crowd as intellectual inferiors. On April 24, he participated in a six-man tag team match, in which he, Chris Masters and Shelton Benjamin were defeated by Carlito, Rob Van Dam, and Charlie Haas. During the Backlash pay-per-view, Striker hosted an edition of his \"Classroom\" segment, which ended when Eugene, who in storyline was mentally impaired, attacked Striker. Striker, in retaliation, attacked Eugene with a dictionary the following night on \"Raw\". The feud between the two ended when Eugene gained a mentor in \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan and defeated Striker. Striker appeared only rarely on \"Raw\" throughout June and July, and his final match for the brand was on July 31, when he was quickly defeated by John Cena.\n\nAt the end of August 2006, Striker left the Raw brand to join ECW, making his debut on August 23. He continued his \"Classroom\" segment on ECW, which provoked a feud with The Sandman after Striker insulted him. Striker made his in-ring debut for the brand on the September 19, 2006 episode of \"ECW\", when his team of Mike Knox and Test were defeated by Tommy Dreamer, Sabu, and The Sandman when Test was disqualified for pushing the referee. Striker continued his feud with The Sandman until the October 17 episode of \"ECW\", when The Sandman defeated him in a Singapore Cane on a Pole match.\nOn February 6, Striker aligned himself with Mr. McMahon's New Breed stable, along with Elijah Burke, Kevin Thorn, and Marcus Cor Von. The New Breed immediately engaged themselves in a feud with the ECW Originals (Rob Van Dam, Tommy Dreamer, Sabu and The Sandman). At WrestleMania 23, the New Breed was defeated by the ECW Originals in an 8-man tag team match, but won a rematch on the following episode of \"ECW\". In the midst of the feud, tension began to appear between the leader Elijah Burke and Striker, after Striker and Cor Von were defeated by the debuting Major Brothers. As a result, Striker began trying to avenge the loss to the Major Brothers and defeated Brett Major on the May 22 episode of \"ECW\". The feud with the Originals lost momentum, however, as Sabu was released from his WWE contract in mid-May, and the feud ended at the One Night Stand pay-per-view, when Striker, Cor Von, and Burke lost to Dreamer, Sandman, and CM Punk in a tables match.\n\nOn June 12, Striker was defeated by The Boogeyman in a singles match, and two weeks later, The Boogeyman attacked him during an edition of \"Piper's Pit\". On July 10, Striker invited Boogeyman to the ring, allowing the debuting Big Daddy V to attack him. Striker then formed an alliance with Big Daddy V that lasted until March 2008, acting as Big Daddy V's manager and regularly accompanying him to the ring. In November, Striker and Big Daddy V started a feud with Kane, after Kane attacked Striker. Striker and Big Daddy V wrestled Kane in a handicap match, and the pair also aligned briefly with Mark Henry. Henry helped Big Daddy V win a match against Kane on the November 27 episode of \"ECW\", and in return, Striker refereed a match between Henry and The Undertaker, refusing to count a pinfall against Henry.\n\nAs part of the 2008 WWE Supplemental Draft in June 2008, Striker was drafted back to the Raw brand. After a brief stint, Striker returned to ECW to take over duties as color commentator, debuting on August 5. Striker and his commentary partner, Todd Grisham, won the 2008 Slammy Award for the Announce Team of the Year for 2008. In April 2009, however, Grisham was moved to the SmackDown brand, and Josh Mathews debuted as the new play-by-play commentator. In addition to commentating on \"ECW on SyFy\" and ECW pay-per-view matches, Striker and Mathews represented the ECW brand on \"WWE Superstars\" every week.\n\nOn October 27, 2009 it was announced that Striker would move from commentary on \"ECW\" to \"SmackDown\", reuniting with Grisham. The move was made to help accommodate Jim Ross, who had been taking time off to deal with his recent Bell's palsy attack. The following October, Striker and Grisham were joined by Michael Cole on \"SmackDown\", forming a three-man announce team. Striker, however, was replaced in early February 2011 by Booker T.\n\nStriker began hosting \"NXT\" in early 2010. He wrestled his first match in three years on the August 2, 2011 episode of \"NXT\", teaming with Titus O'Neil in a winning effort against Derrick Bateman and Darren Young in a tag team match. He fought Young in the next two weeks, but Young emerged victorious both times. Striker later teamed up with William Regal to face Young and JTG, but Striker and Regal were unsuccessful. Meanwhile, as \"NXT\" host, Striker was frequently bullied by Curt Hawkins and Tyler Reks, The storyline included his \"kidnapping\" on the March 21 episode of \"NXT Redemption\" by unknown persons, later revealed to be Hawkins and Reks. During this time, Striker also continued to commentate on \"Superstars\", with the explanation given being that to keep his kidnapping a secret, WWE hired a body double to assume Striker's duties. Striker was later \"rescued\" on the April 11 episode \"NXT Redemption\". Striker ceased his role as NXT host with the conclusion of \"NXT Redemption\".\n\nAfter hosting \"NXT\", Striker began interviewing WWE employees on \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\". During the summer of 2012, Striker became the host of \"WWE Afterburn\" for international broadcasts. On the October 12 \"SmackDown\", Striker tried to interview Team Hell No (Kane and Daniel Bryan), but they both attacked him. On the October 15 episode of \"Raw\", Striker demanded that he receive an apology and was instead forced to face Kane in his final WWE match, which Striker lost. On June 20, 2013, Striker departed WWE after the company opted to not renew his contract.\n\nOn June 21, Striker made his first post-WWE appearance, by appearing on Family Wrestling Entertainment iPPV, \"FWE Rumble\" in Queens, New York as a color commentator. On October 21, 2013, Striker was defeated by Justin Credible in NYWC's House of Madness. After the match, Striker nailed Credible, causing him to bleed. Backstage, Striker tried to apologize but Credible cursed him out in the locker room and stormed off. On July 2013, Championship Wrestling from Hollywood (CWFH) announced Striker as the new announcer of the promotion on MAVTV.

From July 18 to August 2, 2014, Striker took part in Pro Wrestling Noah's 2014 NTV G+ Cup Junior Heavyweight Tag League, where he and partner Super Crazy finished with a record of two wins and two losses, failing to advance to the finals.\n\nOn September 5, 2014, it was reported that Striker had signed with Lucha Underground as the lead English language announcer, alongside Vampiro. Striker and Vampiro have provided English language commentary since the show's debut.\n\nStriker, along with Vampiro, served as one half of the English language commentators for AAA's Lucha Libre World Cup internet pay-per-view on May 24, 2015. On August 9, 2015, Striker returned to AAA English language commentary alongside Hugo Savinovich for AAA's Triplemanía XXIII pay-per-view.\n\nStriker and Jim Ross served as the English language commentators for New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW)'s Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome pay-per-view on January 4, 2015. On October 12, Striker returned to NJPW to provide English commentary on King of Pro-Wrestling, this time working alongside long-time Ring of Honor commentator Kevin Kelly. The following year, Striker returned to NJPW English commentary at Wrestle Kingdom 10 in Tokyo Dome on January 4, 2016, again working alongside Kelly, as well as NJPW wrestler Yoshitatsu.\n\nKaye was a child actor and had roles in the films \"Wise Guys\" and \"Child Savers\".

He has worked with many artists including The Wallflowers, Pete Yorn, Soul Asylum, Stone Sour, Joseph Arthur and Coheed and Cambria.\n\nJaffee was born on March 11, 1969, in Los Angeles. When he was 13, he purchased a keyboard and was soon playing with local bands. After graduating from Fairfax High School, he continued to play in various bands, and he took session work in recording studios.\n\nAround 1989, Jakob Dylan and his friend Tobi Miller formed a group called the Apples, playing various clubs in the L.A. area. While waiting in line at Canter's deli after 2:00 am, Jaffee heard the Apples wanted an organist/pianist, and he was told that Dylan and Miller were then in the Kibitz Room bar attached to Canter's. They met; Dylan and Miller played Jaffee some demo tapes in their car stereo, and Jaffee immediately joined the group. A few weeks later, they changed their name to the Wallflowers and signed with Virgin Records. In 1992, they released their first album, \"The Wallflowers\". The Wallflowers toured throughout the U.S. and Canada in 1992 and early 1993. They served as the opening act for Cracker, the Spin Doctors and 10,000 Maniacs, and they started headlining their own shows.\n\nVirgin appeared to lose interest in the Wallflowers because of poor album sales. The band's two familiar label representatives left the label, after which the record company tried to use the Dylan name as a selling point, against the band's directive. In mid-1993, the label released the band from their contract. Other labels were not interested in signing the band, and Jaffee filled his time by playing gigs with El Vez as well as taking more session work. He kept his interest in the Wallflowers, saying later, \"I believe in these songs, and I'm here for the duration because no one is writing songs like these anymore, songs that have room for a Hammond organ and me.\"\n\nThe Wallflowers signed to Interscope Records in 1994. While working with T Bone Burnett, who was producing the band's next album, Jaffee was frequently called in as a session musician for producers Paul Fox, Matt Hyde and Rick Neigher. Because of this, in 1996 he was credited on albums by Rickie Lee Jones, the Hookers, Leah Andreone and Chalk FarM. At the same time, the Wallflowers released their second album, \"Bringing Down the Horse\", which went quadruple Platinum. The band toured in support of the album, but in 1997, Jaffee and his wife had a daughter, and he left the tour to be with his family for two months. That same year, he performed session work with Everclear, Grant Lee Buffalo, Richie Sambora, Macy Gray, Jeremy Toback, Joe Henry, Melissa Etheridge, Ramsay Midwood and Garth Brooks.\n\nThe Wallflowers received a Grammy nomination in 1998 for \"Heroes\" which appeared in the film \"Godzilla\". In late 2000, the band released \"Breach\". The band headlined their own tour for a year but also opened for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, the Who and John Mellencamp. Following this, the Wallflowers released \"Red Letter Days\", touring again during 2002–2003. With a new drummer, the band released \"Rebel, Sweetheart\", their fifth album, on May 24, 2005. The Wallflowers toured to promote the album, but Jaffee disagreed with the band, and he abandoned the tour with three dates remaining.\n\nIn 2005, Jaffee began collaborating with Foo Fighters. He was made an official member in 2017.\n\nJaffee led the house band on \"The Fran Drescher Show\" and, as of 2010, co-owned a recording studio called Fonogenic Studios in the San Fernando Valley.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, Jaffee was a member of the Sound City Players, a supergroup formed by Dave Grohl that, in addition to appearing in Grohl's 2013 documentary, \"Sound City\", played a limited number of tour dates in 2013. The Sound City Players consisted of a rotating number of artists including Grohl, Jaffee, Stevie Nicks, Alain Johannes, Paul McCartney, Rick Springfield, Josh Homme, Trent Reznor, Krist Novoselic and more.\n\nIn 2012, Jaffee returned to the Wallflowers, who were coming off a long hiatus.

It works in conjunction with a screen-based telephone (\"screenphone\") or other compatible customer-premises equipment (CPE) to provide the user with softkey access to telephone company or internal PBX custom calling features. It is an analog service because it uses analog frequency-shift keying (FSK) technology to interact with an LCD screen via short, low-baud rate, downloads to refresh and re-program softkeys in real-time.\n\nThe technology introduced in the United States and rolled out to Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) from Bellcore in April 1995, (very soon after the introduction of CLASS-based services through electronic switching system (ESS)), was marketed by the RBOCs who implemented it, as a way to streamline all available custom calling options through the use of a screen-based telephone; giving Residential and Small Business telephone subscribers PBX-like functionality at home or in small office/home office (SOHO) locations at a significantly lower cost. The service debuted before the onslaught of Personal Communications Service (PCS) and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)-based telephony technologies became available and was originally slated to also work in conjunction with other types of services such as Enhanced Directory Assistance, telephone banking, movie theatre ticket sales, and other services that could interact with an LCD-screen.\n\nSome of those services did become available later, though, not at the dramatic increase the US-based telephone companies had hoped. Canadian telephone companies such as Telus and Bell Canada, however, had much better luck implementing more ADSI-based services with other industries such as banking, and were still marketing the service actively as of 2005.\n\nThe service is marketed at telephone customers who subscribe to the majority of Custom Local Area Signaling Services (CLASS)-based services offered by their local telephone company (such as caller ID, Call Return, etc.) by the customization of a telephone capable of providing one-touch access to these features. This greatly increases customer usability by alleviating the need to memorize dialing codes such as *69.\n\nAdditionally, a few RBOCs introduced new features such as Call Waiting Deluxe and Message Waiting Indicator to work exclusively with ADSI telephones. The former being perhaps the most involved example of ADSI capabilities and the latter being an example of Visual FSK; another new technology available through CLASS.\n\nThe RBOCs who offer this service also restructured their billing of these services into value-based \"packages\" to stimulate customer interest.\n\nU S West Communications, the first local RBOC to offer this service, marketed it as \"Home Receptionist\" service. Home Receptionist service included a Nortel Powertouch (or Vista) 350 screen-based telephone and \"line-provisioning\" service to make it work. This service is still offered by Qwest Communications (the successor to US West), BellSouth and SBC Communications; though the service has different marketing names.\n\nNortel discontinued the x5x telephone line and introduced a more streamlined version called the 39x-line and then later the 48x-line in 1998. CIDCo and Cybiotronics later introduced their own lines of screenphones after the original Nortel Patent expired. \n\nNortel sold off its CPE line to Aastra Technologies in 1999 and Aastra continues to market these telephones through various channels.\n\nPhilips Austria manufactured a Screen Phone model called the P100.

As well as normal hardback and paperback editions, it was released as a free e-book under the CC BY-NC-ND license. \"Accelerando\" won the Locus Award in 2006, and was nominated for several other awards in 2005 and 2006, including the Hugo, Campbell, Clarke, and British Science Fiction Association Awards.\n\nIn Italian, \"accelerando\" means \"speeding up\" and is used as a tempo marking in musical notation. In Stross' novel, it refers to the accelerating rate at which humanity in general, and/or the novel's characters, head towards the technological singularity. The term was earlier used in this way by Kim Stanley Robinson in his 1985 novel \"The Memory of Whiteness\" and his 1992–96 \"Mars\" trilogy.\n\nThe book is a collection of nine short stories telling the tale of three generations of a family before, during, and after a technological singularity. It was originally written as a series of novelettes and novellas, all published in \"Asimov's Science Fiction\" magazine in the period 2001 to 2004. According to Stross, the initial inspiration for the stories was his experience working as a programmer for a high-growth company during the dot-com boom of the 1990s.\n\nThe first three stories follow the character of agalmic \"venture altruist\" Manfred Macx, starting in the early 21st century; the second three stories follow his daughter Amber; and the final three focus largely on Amber's son Sirhan in the completely transformed world at the end of the century.\n\nStross describes humanity's situation at the start of \"Accelerando\" as dire:\n\nIn the background of what looks like a Panglossian techno-optimist novel, horrible things are happening. Most of humanity is wiped out, then arbitrarily resurrected in mutilated form by the Vile Offspring. Capitalism eats \"everything\" then the logic of competition pushes it so far that merely human entities can no longer compete; we're a fat, slow-moving, tasty resource – like the dodo. Our narrative perspective, Aineko, is \"not\" a talking cat: it's a vastly superintelligent AI, coolly calculating, that has worked out that human beings are more easily manipulated if they think they're dealing with a furry toy. The cat body is a sock puppet wielded by an abusive monster.\n\nAs events progress in \"Accelerando\", the planets of the solar system are dismantled over time to form a Matrioshka brain, a vast solar-powered computational device inhabited by minds inconceivably more advanced and complex than naturally evolved intelligences such as human beings. This proves to be a normal stage in the life-cycle of an inhabited solar system; the galaxies are revealed to be filled with such Matrioshka brains. Intelligent consciousnesses outside of Matrioshka brains may communicate via wormhole networks.\n\nThe notion that the universe is dominated by a communications network of superintelligences bears comparison with Olaf Stapledon's 1937 science-fiction novel \"Star Maker\", although Stapledon's advanced civilisations are said to communicate psychically rather than informatically.\n\n\nIn the following table, the chapter number (#), chapter name & original magazine date of publication, and a brief synopsis are given. The nine stories are grouped into three parts.\n\nThe novel contains numerous allusions to real-world scientific concepts and individuals, including:\n\n\"Accelerando\" won the 2006 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, and the 2010 Estonian SF Award for Best Translated Novel of 2009. Additionally, the novel was shortlisted for several other awards, including:\n\nThe original short story \"Lobsters\" (June 2001) was shortlisted for:\n\nThe original short story \"Halo\" (June 2002) was shortlisted for:\n\nThe original short story \"Router\" (September 2002) was shortlisted for:\n\nThe original short story \"Nightfall\" (April 2003) was shortlisted for:\n\nThe original short story \"Elector\" (September 2004) was shortlisted for:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The main purpose of the newspaper was to oppose the Vietnam war. The first four monthly issues were mimeographed pamphlets, and in June 1968 it became a broadsheet. HQ moved to Cincinnati in January 1969. First a monthly, later a biweekly, eventually a monthly (following an arson fire on Labor Day, 1970), it carried News of the war and of the war resistance movement. There were also some stories about the people and events of Cincinnati, Ohio and the surrounding area.\n\nDuring the heyday of the \"Eye\", as its devotees called it, leadership duties were shared by Alex Varrone, Jennifer Varrone, Monty Sher and Ellen Bierhorst Sher. Alex was founding editor. And business manager; Monty helped with initial community organizing support. Ellen managed the make up and lay out team out of the Sher's home in Clifton, the Lloydhouse. Frankie Gerson, later the founder of Cincinnati's Free Store, was the star newspaper peddler, selling more copies than anyone else on the streets Downtown.\n\nThe paper featured cartoon art by Ted Richards. The staff split and several members formed the \"Queen City Express\", a newspaper that focused on younger readers.\n\nThe schism in the staff had to do with the issue of violence in the peace movement. One faction, led by Ted Richards, advocated that the paper call for \"off the pigs\" – in other words vilification of all law enforcement personnel. Horrified by this position, the Shers withdrew from participation in about 1971. The paper then moved to an apartment on Vine Street just south of McMillan.\nAfter the Shers and, later, the Varrones had withdrawn, Michael Wood (brother of Northside Community leaders Maureen and Peggy Wood) took over leadership in the 70's.\n\nRegular publication halted in 1974–1975. \"The Independent Eye\" began publication once again in 2005.\n\nEllen Bierhorst Sher donated a complete archive of the early years to the public library – or perhaps it was the historical society – sometime in the 1990s.\n"}

{"id": "2233267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233267", "title": "The Third Eye (book)", "text": "The Third Eye (book)\n\nThe Third Eye is a book published by Secker & Warburg in November 1956. It was originally claimed that the book was written by a Tibetan monk named Lobsang Rampa. On investigation the author was found to be one Cyril Henry Hoskin (1910–1981), the son of a British plumber, who claimed that his body was occupied by the spirit of a Tibetan monk named Tuesday Lobsang Rampa. The book is considered a hoax.\n\nThe story of \"The Third Eye\" begins in Tibet during the reign of the 13th Dalai Lama. Tuesday Lobsang Rampa, the son of a Lhasa aristocrat, takes up theological studies and is soon recognised for his prodigious abilities. As he enters adolescence, the young Rampa undertakes increasingly challenging feats until he is recognised as a crucial asset to the future of an independent Tibet. Tibet's Lamas had foretold a future in which China would attempt to reassert its authority, and Rampa is operated upon to help him preserve his country. A third eye is drilled into his forehead, allowing him to see human auras and to determine people's hidden motivations.\n\nWith his third eye, Rampa can serve as an aide in the Dalai Lama's court and spy on visitors to the court as they are being received. The visitors upon whom Rampa spies include the scholar Sir Charles Alfred Bell, deemed by Rampa as naive but benevolent. In contrast, Rampa and others are certain that Chinese visitors are nefarious and are soon to attempt to bring conquest and destruction to Tibet. Tibet must then prepare for an invasion. During the story, Rampa meets yetis, and at the end of the book he encounters a mummified body that was him in an earlier incarnation. He also takes part in an initiation ceremony in which he learns that during its early history the planet Earth was struck by another planet, causing Tibet to become the mountain kingdom that it is today. The popularity of the book led to two sequels, \"The Doctor from Lhasa\" and \"The Rampa Story\", and Lobsang Rampa wrote twenty books in all.\n\nAlthough it is claimed by the author to be an authentic autobiography of Rampa's education as a monk born in Tibet, the book's emphasis on the occult made scholars doubtful about its origins. The book includes a description of a surgical operation similar to trepanation in which a third eye is drilled into the forehead of Rampa, allegedly in order to enhance his psychic powers. After the book became a bestseller, selling 500,000 copies in its first two years, Heinrich Harrer, explorer and Tibetologist, hired the private detective Clifford Burgess to investigate the background of the author. In February 1958 the results of the investigation were published in the \"Daily Mail\". The author of the book turned out to be a man named Cyril Henry Hoskin, who came from Plympton in Devon and was the son of a plumber. Hoskin had never been to Tibet and spoke no Tibetan. When interviewed by the British press, Hoskin (who had legally changed his name to Carl Kuon So in 1948) admitted that he had written the book. He claimed in his 1960 book \"The Rampa Story\" that his body had been taken over by the Tibetan monk's spirit after falling out of an apple tree in the garden of his home. Hoskin always maintained that his books were true stories and denied any suggestions of a hoax.\n\nAlthough detractors regard the book as a myth of Cyril Hoskin's own creation, \"The Third Eye\" and its sequels remain the most popular publications claiming to represent life in Tibet. The dismissal of the book as a fabrication by scholars did not undermine its popularity, despite the lack of records of Rampa ever having lived and its depiction of events that are not found in the standard literature describing life in a Tibetan monastery. Writing in \"The Observer\" in May 2020, David Bramwell noted, \"History should not judge Rampa, who died in 1981, too harshly. Many leading Tibetologists admit that he set them on their paths, and the Dalai Lama has acknowledged Rampa’s role in drawing attention to the plight of his country.\"\n\nGordon Stein in \"Encyclopedia of Hoaxes\" (1993) has written:\n\n"}

The XP-72 was designed around the Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major 28-cylinder air-cooled radial engine with a supercharger mounted behind the pilot and driven by an extension shaft from the engine. The armament consisted of six 50 caliber wing-mounted machine guns and underwing racks for two 1,000 lb bombs.\n\nThe XP-72 development paralleled that of another Republic design, the XP-69 that was to be powered by an experimental 42-cylinder Wright R-2160 liquid-cooled inline radial engine mounted in the nose of the aircraft and driving contra-rotating propellers. The XP-69 was intended for high altitude operations and featured a pressurized cockpit and armament of two 37 mm cannon and four 50 caliber machine guns.

The second prototype was completed on 26 June 1944 and was equipped with an Aero-Products contra-rotating propeller.

By this time, the war had progressed to where the need was for long-range escort fighters and not high-speed interceptors.

{"id": "2233278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233278", "title": "Caledonia", "text": "Caledonia\n\nCaledonia () is the Latin name given by the Romans to the land north of their province of \"Britannia\", beyond the frontier of their empire, roughly corresponding to modern-day Scotland. However, southern Caledonia, as far north as the Antonine Wall, was part of the Roman Empire for some periods of time (like in the case of the Valentia Province). The etymology of the name is probably from a P-Celtic source. Its modern usage is as a romantic or poetic name for all Scotland in general.\n\nThe original use of the name, by Tacitus, Ptolemy, Lucan and Pliny the Elder, referred to the area later known as \"Pictavia\" or Pictland, mostly in what is now Scotland, to the north of Hadrian's Wall (though the wall is all in today's Northern England). The name may be related to that of a large central Brythonic tribe, the \"Caledonii\", one amongst several in the area and perhaps the dominant tribe, which would explain the binomial Caledonia/Caledonii.\n\nThe name of the Caledonians may be found in toponymy, such as \"Dùn Chailleann\", the Scottish Gaelic word for the town of Dunkeld meaning \"fort of the Caledonii\", and possibly in that of the mountain \"Sìdh Chailleann\", the \"fairy hill of the Caledonians\". According to \"Historia Brittonum\" the site of the seventh battle of the mythical Arthur was a forest in what is now Scotland, called \"Coit Celidon\" in early Welsh.\n\nAccording to Zimmer (2006), Caledonia is derived from the tribal name \"Caledones\" (or \"Calīdones\"), which he etymologises as possessing hard feet', alluding to standfastness or endurance\", from the Proto-Celtic roots \"*kal-\" \"hard\" and \"*φēdo-\" \"foot\". Similarly, Moffat (2005) suggests the name is related to the Welsh word \"caled\", \"hard\", which could refer to the rocky land or the hardiness of the people. Keay and Keay (1994) state that the word is \"apparently pre-Celtic\".\n\nThe exact location of what the Romans called Caledonia in the early stages of Britannia is uncertain, and the boundaries are unlikely to have been fixed until the building of Hadrian's Wall. From then onwards, Caledonia stood to the north of the wall, and to the south was the Roman province of Britannia (consisting of most of what is now England and Wales). During the brief Roman military incursions into central and northern Scotland, the Scottish Lowlands were indeed absorbed into the province of Britannia, and the name was also used by the Romans, prior to their conquest of the southern and central parts of the island, to refer to the whole island of Great Britain.\n\nOnce the Romans had built a second wall further to the north (the Antonine Wall) and their garrisons advanced north likewise, the developing Roman-Britons south of the wall had trade relations with the Picts north of the wall, as testified by archaeological evidence, much of it available at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.\n\nThe modern use of \"Caledonia\" in English and Scots is either as a historical description of northern Britain during the Roman era or as a romantic or poetic name for Scotland as a whole.\n\nThe name has been widely used by organisations and commercial entities. Notable examples include Glasgow Caledonian University, ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne, and the now-defunct British Caledonian airline and Caledonian Railway. The Caledonian Sleeper is an overnight train service from London to Scottish destinations. The Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. is a professional football club. In music, \"Caledonia\" is a popular Scottish patriotic song and folk ballad written by Dougie MacLean in 1977 and published in 1979 on an album of the same name; it has since been covered by various other artists, most notably Frankie Miller. The web series \"Caledonia\" and associated novel is a supernatural police drama that takes place in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nPtolemy's account also referred to the \"Caledonia Silva\", an idea still recalled in the modern expression \"Caledonian Forest\", although the woods are much reduced in size since Roman times.\n\nSome scholars point out that the name \"Scotland\" is ultimately derived from Scotia, a Latin term first used for Ireland (also called Hibernia by the Romans) and later for Scotland, the Scoti peoples having originated in Ireland and resettled in Scotland. Another, post-conquest, Roman name for the island of Great Britain was Albion, which is cognate with the Scottish Gaelic name for Scotland: \"Alba\".\n\nThere is an emerging trend to use the term Caledonia to describe New Caledonia in English, which reflects the usage in French of Calédonie (where the full name is La Nouvelle-Calédonie). The New Caledonian trade and investment department promotes inward investment with the slogan “Choose Caledonia”.\n\n\n\n"}

He was killed at the age of 18 on the day of Ashura, in the Battle of Karbala’. According to Jean Calmard writing in Iranica, ‘Ali al-Akbar's reputation as a valiant warrior of the Household of Muhammad might have preceded that of Al-‘Abbas ibn ‘Ali.\n\nAli al-Akbar was Husayn's eldest son who was 18 years old at the battle of Karbala. Two of his brothers were also named Ali, Ali al-Asghar ibn Husayn and Zayn al-Abidin. The teenager resembled his maternal grandfather Muhammad, the prophet of Allah, so much that Husayn ibn Ali often said, \"whenever I happen to miss my maternal grandfather I look at the face of Ali al-Akbar.\" Ali al-Akbar was killed by Murrah ibn Munqad on 10 Muharram 61 AH in battle of Karbala.\n\nAs an Iranica said, Ali al-Akbar was the first of the person who was killed in battle-field. He had a loud and beautiful voice, on the morning of the day of Ashura, Husayn ibn Ali asked Ali Akbar as to call out the Adhan. Husayn ibn Ali and many women in their tents began to weep when Ali Akbar began calling out the Adhan, suspecting that it may be the last time they heard Ali Akbar give the Adhan.\n\nAli Akbar stood in front of Husayn ibn Ali after Zuhr prayers and said: \"Father I request for permission to go and fight the enemies of Islam.\" His father gave him permission and said, \"May Allah be with you! But Akbar, you know how much your mother, sisters, and aunts love you. Go and say farewell to them.\" Ali Akbar went into the tent of his mother, Umme Layla. Every time he wanted to come out of the tent his mother, aunts, and sisters would pull his cloak and say, \"O Akbar, How will we live without you?\" Husayn ibn Ali had to plead with all to let Ali Akbar go.\n\nHusayn ibn Ali helped his son mount his horse. As Akbar began to ride towards the battlefield he heard footsteps behind him. He looked back and saw his father. He said: \"Father, we have said good-bye. Why are you walking behind me?\" Husayn ibn Ali replied, \"My son if you had a son like yourself then you would have surely understood!\"\n\nAccording to Bal'ami, Ali Akbar stroke the enemies ten times and killed two or three of them each time.\n\nHe walked towards the battlefield. When he went to Akbar, Akbar placed his right hand on his wounded chest and his left arm over the shoulder of his father. Al-Husayn asked, \"Akbar, why do you embrace me with only one arm?\" Akbar did not reply. Al-Husayn tried to move Akbar's right hand, but Akbar resisted. Then Al-Husayn forcefully moved the hand and saw the blade of the spear. He laid Akbar on the ground and sat on his knees, placing both of his hands on the blade of the spear. He looked at Najaf, where his father was buried, and said, \"Father, I too have come to my Khaybar!\" He pulled out the blade, with it came to the heart of Akbar. Al-Husayn, distraught seeing his son in such pain and stress, wept. Akbar sent his last Salam and martyred.\n\n"}

After crossing over Oleander Drive, NC 132 and US 117 continue through a commercially active section of the city, with multiple shopping centers, restaurants and small stores along the route. After passing Hurst Drive, NC 132 runs along the western border of the University of North Carolina Wilmington, providing multiple accesses to the university. After crossing over Randall Parkway, NC 132 runs between the busy shopping centers of University Commons-Wilmington and University Centre. The road continues to see multiple stores after passing New Centre Drive. Just north of New Centre, College Road uses an interchange with US 17 Business, and begins to parallel MLK Parkway (US 74). Nearing an intersection with US 74, College Road passes just east of a Costco and passes to the west of a factory for Corning Inc. The road meets up with US 74 at a four-way intersection with Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway. Immediately following the intersection, College Road runs through a very residential section of northern Wilmington, providing access for multiple neighborhoods. After Kings Grant Road, the median of the highway widens to prepare for the beginning of I-40. NC 132/US 117 run a very brief concurrency with I-40 for about before both highway exit off at exit 420B.\n\nNC 132 merges onto a four-lane divided road, named College Road (the same as the rest of the highways routing). The road passes several small stores, however no shopping centers are present alongside the highway. As the highway leaves Wilmington, it passes by Emsley A. Laney High School. College Road provides several entrances to a large neighborhood to the west of the highway. College Road passes an industrial park situated between it and I-40. As the road progresses further north, it passes over I-140 and US 17, which leads the road from its suburban surroundings to more rural ones. Passing Cape Fear Community College, the road is lead in a heavily forested area, however as the road gets closer to Castle Hayne, more neighborhoods become apparent off the sides of the road. As NC 132 nears its northern terminus, it passes by a quarry and then makes a turn to head directly north. NC 132 ends at a roundabout with NC 133 just south of Castle Hayne. NC 133 and US 117 continue together to the north on a separate concurrency.\n\nNC 132 was created in 1958 as new routing running from US 421 south of Wilmington along College Road to US 117 in Castle Hayne. In 1983 NC 132 was rerouted along new freeway from the present day I-40 interchange to US 117 near Wallace. The routing NC 132 left behind into Castle Hayne became a secondary road. In August 1984, NC 132 was removed from the freeway routing, and reinstated on its previous routing along College Road to Castle Hayne. The freeway was subsequently renumbered as a part of Interstate 40. On March 17th, 2003, US 117 was removed from its routing south of Castle Hayne to downtown Wilmington. Instead it was routed along NC 132 south to Shipyard Boulevard. A roundabout replaced an at-grade Y-intersection at NC 132's northern terminus in August 2015.\n\n"}

{"id": "2233303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233303", "title": "GWR 5600 Class", "text": "GWR 5600 Class\n\nThe GWR 5600 Class is a class of 0-6-2T steam locomotive built between 1924 and 1928. They were designed by C.B Collett for the Great Western Railway (GWR), and were introduced into traffic in 1924. After the 1923 grouping, Swindon inherited a large and variable collection of locomotives from historic Welsh railway companies, which did not fit into their standardisation programme. GWR boiler inspectors arrived en masse and condemned many of the original locomotives. The systematic destruction of many examples of locomotives, most still in serviceable condition, followed. \n\nTwo hundred GWR 5600 class replacement locomotives were built and remained in service until withdrawn by British Railways between 1962 and 1965. Nine of the class have survived into preservation.\n\nThe railways of South Wales seem to have had a particular liking for the 0-6-2T type. This was because the nature of the work they undertook demanded high adhesive weight, plenty of power with good braking ability, but no need for outright speed, nor large tanks or bunker as the distances from pit to port were short. The 0-6-2 configuration was discovered to confidently handle the sharp curves so prevalent in the area. These Welsh locomotives were taken over by the GWR at the Grouping in 1922, as follows:\n\nSome were rebuilt with GWR taper boilers. A number of them passed into British Railways (BR) ownership in 1948, including (with some gaps in numbering):\nOf the Taff Vale Railway, many engines continued to operate up to the 1950s, but today only two locomotives survived, TVR 'O1' No.28, the last-surviving Welsh-built engine, and TVR 'O2' No.85.\n\nFor further information on these pre-grouping locomotives see Locomotives of the Great Western Railway.\n\nWhen the GWR took over the Welsh valley lines, they discovered that the Welsh locomotive crews liked their 0-6-2T locomotives. Rather than a new design the 5600 Class was a \"Swindonised\" version of the Rhymney Railway M class and R class locomotives. The 1904 M class (and the similar 1909 R class) were successful designs ideally suited to hauling heavy coal trains a relatively short distance.\n\nThe 5600 Class was specially designed for work in South Wales, replacing the elderly, worn-out locomotives that had been 'inherited' in 1923, when the smaller railway companies were forcibly merged into the GWR at The Grouping. Contrary to this trend, the Rhymney Railway's more modern 0-6-2s were in generally good order and had proved successful. Thus they became the blueprint for the 56xx.\n\nThe first of five R class locos was re-boilered by the GWR in 1926 and a single M class was upgraded in 1930. In this form, both were visually almost indistinguishable from the 56 Class.\n\nThe design of the 5600 Class followed Great Western Railway practice as far as possible, by utilising many standardised parts. Included in Collett's innovations was a Standard Number 2 boiler which was suitable for the 5600 Class, and the M and R class Rhymney locomotives, complete with the traditional brass GWR safety valve casing and copper-capped chimney.\n\nThey were substantial sized tank engines, 37 ft 6ins in length and weighing 62 tons. The side tanks were capable of holding 1900 gallons of water. The high domed cab, bunker and tanks were closely related to the 31xx and 42xx classes. One hundred of the class were built at the GWR workshops in Swindon from 1924-1927.\n\nWhile they were powerful machines, the 5600s were very unpopular with footplate crews at the time. They were beset by numerous failures, the most common of which was hot axle boxes. They lacked the wider tolerances in their boxes that the original Welsh company locomotives had. They also had the tendency to derail, so those driving them preferred them in reverse, where the pony truck was able to guide them around tight curves. When the first batch were hastily recalled back to Swindon, Collett faced criticism from the Director of Caerphilly Works in building such a locomotive unsuited to the lines they were meant to work on. \n\nIn 1927 another 100 similar engines were constructed – these were slightly heavier and numbered in the 66xx series. Nos 6600-6649 were Swindon-built in 1927-1928, but due to the pressure of work 6650-6699 were built by Armstrong Whitworth in 1928. This resulted in some minor design differences from the Swindon locomotives, most visible were additional balance weights fitted inside the driving wheels webs opposite the crank pin to remedy the faults. When the Welsh railwaymen discovered that the new GWR 5700 Class 0-6-0 pannier tank (introduced 1929) was even more suitable for the same work – being shorter and lighter, with roughly the same (slightly lower) tractive effort – no further Class 56xx/66xx locos were built.\n\nThe 5600 Class had the distinction of being the only locomotive of 0-6-2 wheel arrangement built new by the GWR. Nevertheless, there were just over 400 locos with that wheel arrangement in service from 1940–1945, demonstrating the large number acquired in 1923.\n\n\nA fall in the South Wales coal trade in the 1930s saw many of the class re-allocated to other parts of the system. Due to the stability of the design, many drivers would typically operate the 56xx class down the Welsh valleys in reverse (bunker first). The placement of the trailing wheels helped the engine enter the curves better than if operated in the other direction. Typically, during operation, when pulling a heavy load the tanks were operated bunker first, and then smokebox first on the return trips up the valleys.\n\nAll the 56xx/66xx locomotives passed into British Railways ownership at nationalisation in 1948, and all remained in service until 1962, at which time they were withdrawn from service quite rapidly, with the onset of diesel traction on BR gaining momentum. All had been retired by 1965.\n\nWithdrawn from 1962-1965.\n\nSeveral ended up in Woodham Brothers' scrapyard in Barry, South Wales, with eight of the nine preserved engines saved from Barry. The majority of the class in preservation were built at Swindon Works, three of them: 6686, 6695 & 6697 being built by Armstrong Whitworth.\n\nAs the locomotives were operated mainly in South Wales, some railfans know the Class by the nickname \"Taffy Tank\"; 'Taffy' being a derogatory term for someone of Welsh descent. However, the 56xx class never had this title officially, whereas the more typical examples of the Rhymney Railway's M and R classes they replaced, were arguably the original 'Taffy Tanks' of fame.\n\nAs of 2017 6 of the class have run in preservation with 3 classmembers currently in operation, 5668 is currently undergoing restoration from scrapyard condition at the Kent and East Sussex Railway, 6634 and 6686 are both awaiting restoration from scrapyard condition at Peak Rail and The Barry Tourist Railway's & 6697 is on static display at Didcot Railway Centre.\nThe following table lists the Preserved locomotives:\n\n"}

{"id": "2233309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233309", "title": "One (U2 song)", "text": "One (U2 song)\n\n\"One\" is a song by Irish rock band U2. It is the third track from their 1991 album \"Achtung Baby\", and it was released as the record's third single in February 1992. During the album's recording sessions at Hansa Studios in Berlin, conflict arose between the band members over the direction of U2's sound and the quality of their material. Tensions almost prompted the band to break up until they achieved a breakthrough with the improvisation of \"One\"; the song was written after the band members were inspired by a chord progression that guitarist the Edge was playing in the studio. The lyrics, written by lead singer Bono, were inspired by the band members' fractured relationships and the German reunification. Although the lyrics ostensibly describe \"disunity\", they have been interpreted in other ways.\n\n\"One\" was released as a benefit single, with proceeds going towards AIDS research. The song topped the Irish Singles Charts, the Canadian \"RPM\" Top Singles chart and the US \"Billboard\" Album Rock Tracks and Modern Rock Tracks charts. It also peaked at number three in New Zealand, number four in Australia, number seven on the UK Singles Chart and number ten on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. In promotion of the song, the band filmed several music videos, although they were not pleased until a third was created.\n\nThe song was acclaimed by critics upon its release, and it has since been featured in polls of the greatest songs of all time. U2 has performed \"One\" at most of their tour concerts since the song's live debut in 1992, and it has appeared in many of the band's concert films. In a live setting, \"One\" is often used by the group to promote human rights or social justice causes, and the song lends its namesake to Bono's charitable organisation, the ONE Campaign. In 2005, U2 re-recorded the song as part of a duet with R&B recording artist Mary J. Blige on her album \"The Breakthrough\".\n\nIn October 1990, U2 arrived in Berlin on the eve of German reunification to begin the recording sessions for \"Achtung Baby\" at Hansa Studios. Expecting to be inspired by a \"New Europe\" and the reuniting city, the band instead found the mood to be bleak and soon conflict arose over their musical direction and the quality of their material. While bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. preferred a sound similar to U2's previous work, vocalist Bono and guitarist the Edge were inspired by European industrial and electronic dance music of the time and were advocating a change. The band also had difficulty developing demos and musical ideas into completed songs. Bono and the Edge believed the lack of progress was the fault of the band, while Clayton and Mullen Jr. believed the problem was the quality of the songs. Mullen said he \"thought this might be the end\" of the band.\n\nUltimately, a breakthrough in the sessions was achieved. While jamming on a song called \"Sick Puppy\"—an early version of \"Mysterious Ways\"—the band tried different chord progressions for the bridge. The jam stopped and the Edge tried playing them alone on an acoustic guitar, as \"everyone was trying to decide if they were any good.\" At the suggestion of producer Daniel Lanois, the Edge played two separate sections sequentially. The band liked the way it flowed and decided to try and play it together. Speaking of the improvisation, the Edge said, \"suddenly something very powerful [was] happening in the room.\" He added, \"Everyone recognized it was a special piece. It was like we'd caught a glimpse of what the song could be.\" Soon afterwards, the band had developed the piece of music into \"One\". Bono recalls that \"the melody, the structure—the whole thing was done in 15 minutes\". He also stated that the lyrics \"just fell out of the sky, a gift\"; the concept was inspired by the band members' fracturing relationships, the German reunification, and Bono's scepticism of the hippie idea of \"oneness\". Bono later sent a note to the Dalai Lama declining an invitation to a festival called \"Oneness\", incorporating a line from the song: \"One—but not the same\". The song's writing inspired the band and changed their outlook on the recording sessions. Mullen Jr. said the song reaffirmed the band's \"blank page approach\" to recording and reassured the band that all was not lost.\nFollowing the song's initial improvisation, tapes of the recording sessions were delivered to assisting producer Brian Eno to gather his input; Eno spent extended periods of time away from the sessions before visiting to review songs, and he believed that distancing himself from the work allowed him to provide the band with a fresh perspective on their material each time he rejoined them. The band were rather anxious about the quality of their material, but when Eno arrived in Berlin, they were surprised to hear that he liked most of the tapes. However, as Bono recalls, Eno said, \"There's just one song I really despise, and that's 'One'.\" Eno felt that they needed to deconstruct the song.\n\nThe band returned to Dublin in 1991 to record at the \"Elsinore\" mansion on the Dalkey coastline. The band continued to work on the song there, adding various overdubs, but not finding a mix they were satisfied with. The Edge thought that they had the foundation for the song, but that it needed \"foreground\". Eno interceded, explaining to the group that \"One\" was among the sessions' tracks in which \"The song has gone, whatever it is you liked about this song is not there anymore\", and that the track had \"disappeared under layers of overdubs\". He created his own mix, which gave the band a better idea of an arrangement they liked. Eno wanted the band to remove the melancholy elements of the song and persuaded them to remove the acoustic guitar from the song. He also worked with Lanois and the Edge to \"undermine the 'too beautiful' feeling\", which is why they added the \"crying guitar parts that have an aggression to them\".\n\nFlood, the sessions' engineer, was unconvinced by the song's mix, saying he \"was the nagging doubter. I always felt it was a bit straight, until we did the final mix.\" The final mix was completed at Windmill Lane Studios in September 1991 on the last night of the album's recording sessions, when some last minute additions were made. Bono did not like a line in the vocals and spent most of the day re-recording it. Later, after the song's mix had just been completed by the production team, the Edge came up with a guitar part he wanted to add to the song's end near the lyric \"Love is a temple\". After convincing the production team to allow the addition, the Edge played the part once and had it mixed in ten minutes later.\n\n\"One\" is a rock ballad played in a 4/4 time signature at a tempo of 91 beats per minute. The verse follows a chord progression of Am–D5–Fmaj–G while the chorus follows C–Am–Fmaj–C.\n\nBono described the song's theme as such: \"It is a song about coming together, but it's not the old hippie idea of 'Let's all live together.' It is, in fact, the opposite. It's saying, We are one, but we're not the same. It's not saying we even want to get along, but that we have to get along together in this world if it is to survive. It's a reminder that we have no choice\". The Edge described it on one level as a \"bitter, twisted, vitriolic conversation between two people who've been through some nasty, heavy stuff\". On another level, he suggested that the line \"we get to carry each other\" introduces \"grace\" to the song and that the wording \"get to\" (instead of \"got to\") is essential, as it suggests that it is a privilege to help one another, not an obligation. The band have been told by many fans that they played the song at their weddings, prompting Bono to respond, \"Are you mad? It's about splitting up!\" There was some speculation that the song described a conversation between a father and his HIV-positive gay son, based on the connection of the song to David Wojnarowicz, a gay artist who died of AIDS. In 2005, Bono said \"It's a father-and-son story. I tried to write about someone I knew who was coming out and was afraid to tell his father. It's a religious father and son.\"\n\n\"One\" was released as the album's third single in February 1992 as a benefit single, with all of the band's royalties being donated to different AIDS research organisations for each country in which the single was released. The group's manager Paul McGuinness commented on their decision: \"The band feels that [AIDS] is the most pressing issue of the day, and we really have to focus people's attention to the AIDS plague that has been with us for 10 years.\" To promote safe sex, U2 sold condoms bearing the album title \"Achtung Baby\" at their Zoo TV Tour concerts. The cover of the single release is a photograph by David Wojnarowicz. The photograph depicts buffaloes falling off a cliff after being chased by Native American hunters. The single's liner notes explain that Wojnarowicz \"identifies himself and ourselves with the buffalo, pushed into the unknown by forces we cannot control or even understand\".\n\nThe single reached number seven in the UK Singles Chart, number ten in the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and number one on the US Album Rock Tracks and Modern Rock Tracks charts.\n\nThree music videos were created for \"One\". The first, directed by Anton Corbijn, was filmed in Berlin and features the band members performing at Hansa Studios interspersed with footage of Trabants (an East German automobile they became fond of as a symbol for a changing Europe) and shots of them dressed in drag. Bono explained that the idea to crossdress \"had been based on the idea that if \"U2 can't do this\", we've got to do it!\", and it was fostered by the group's experiences dressing in drag for the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. However, the band pulled the video, fearing the single's status as an AIDS benefit would result in critics finding AIDS-related interpretations of the video. The Edge explained, \"We didn't want to be involved in putting back the AIDS issue into the realm of sexuality... It wasn't worth the risk of people imagining we were saying something about the AIDS issue through the drag footage, which was totally not what we were trying to say.\"\n\nThe second video was directed by Mark Pellington. It comprises images of blooming flowers, the title word in several languages, and slow-motion footage of buffaloes running, leading up to Wojnarowicz's \"Falling Buffalo\" photograph. Much like for the first video, the band did not believe Pellington's video would be good for promoting the single.\n\nThe group filmed a third video in an attempt to appeal to a broader audience. It was directed by \"Rattle and Hum\" director Phil Joanou and was primarily filmed in early March 1992 at Nell's, a Manhattan nightclub. The video depicts Bono sitting at a table smoking a cheroot and drinking beer, interspersed with footage of the band performing in concert. While Bono was filmed, the rest of the band, along with models and transvestites, attended a party in the basement, awaiting their turns to be filmed. However, they were never called to the set and by 3 a.m., they realised that the video was to focus on Bono.\n\nAfter the release of \"Achtung Baby\", critics praised \"One\". In its review of the album, \"Entertainment Weekly\" called the song \"biting and unprecedentedly emotional\" and opined that its \"extravagant stylings and wild emotings [...] put it among Bono's most dramatic moments on record\". In its review of the album, \"Rolling Stone\" called the song a \"radiant ballad\", noting that \"Few bands can marshal such sublime power, but it's just one of the many moments on \"Achtung Baby\" when we're reminded why, before these guys were the butt of cynical jokes, they were rock & roll heroes—as they still are.\" Niall Stokes of \"Hot Press\" gave an enthusiastic review of the song, calling it one of the album's tracks \"whose potency defies equivocations\". Stokes said the song, both upon initial and repeated listens, \"seems transcendent, a magnificent synthesis of elements, words and music, rhythm, instrumentation arrangement and intonation combine to create something that speaks a language beyond logic, the definitive language of emotional truth\". He said the melody was reminiscent of Led Zeppelin and the vocals evoked memories of Al Green and the Rolling Stones circa \"Sympathy for the Devil\". Stokes could not single out what made the song so \"utterly inspirational\", but said it was \"soul music that avoids the obvious cliches of the genre and cuts to the core\".\n\n\"Q\" called Bono's singing on the song a \"quieter moment\" that has \"never been so persuasively tender\". The \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote that the song \"builds with the stately grandeur of a Roy Orbison ballad\" and that Bono's lyric \"We're one / But we're not the same\" is one of \"pithiest insights yet about the contradiction of marriage\". The \"Orlando Sentinel\" called the track \"sorrowful\" and compared it to music by the Rolling Stones. Robert Hilburn of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called the \"disillusioned\" track one of the album's high points. Denise Sullivan of Allmusic wrote that the song was \"among U2's finest recordings\", and she praised its \"lyrical simplicity, heart-rending vocal delivery, and evocative instrumentation\". She called the Edge's guitar playing \"unusually warm and soulful\". In the 1992 Pazz & Jop critics' poll in \"The Village Voice\", \"One\" placed at number eight on the \"Best Single\" list.\n\nIn 1992, Axl Rose told \"RIP magazine\": \"I think their song 'One' is one of the greatest songs ever written. Now I can see and understand why people were into U2 years ago.\"\n\n\"One\" has frequently appeared on lists of the greatest songs. In 2010, \"Rolling Stone\" placed the song at number 36 on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", making it the highest-ranked U2 song. In 2003, a special edition issue of \"Q\", titled \"1001 Best Songs Ever\", named \"One\" the greatest song of all-time. VH1 ranked the song second on its list of \"Greatest Songs of the 90s\", and voters in an April 2006 poll on VH1 named the song as having the UK's number-one lyric: \"One life, with each other, sisters, brothers\". In 2005, \"Blender\" ranked the song at number four on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born\". The following year, readers of \"Q\" voted \"One\" the fifth-greatest song in history. The song subsequently appeared as one of seven U2 songs in the 2006 music reference book \"1001 Songs: The Great Songs of All Time and the Artists, Stories, and Secrets\". It is included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\n\nOn 31 December 2006, \"One\" was announced by BBC Radio 1 to be the thirty-fifth highest-selling single of 2006 in the UK. The collaboration was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals in December 2006.\n\nIn late 2006, a Bank of America employee sang \"One\" with lyrics modified to refer to the Bank of America and MBNA merger. The video subsequently became an Internet phenomenon. Universal Music Group, the copyright owner of the song, posted a cease and desist letter directed at Bank of America in the comments section of Stereogum, one of the blogs that posted the video.\n\n\"One\" made its live debut on 29 February 1992 in Lakeland, Florida on the opening night of the Zoo TV Tour, and it was played at every subsequent show on U2's concert tours until the first show of the Innocence + Experience Tour in Vancouver, where it was not played for the first time in its history. However, the song returned for the following concert, when it was used as the show closer. Zoo TV performances were accompanied by footage from the second music video being displayed on the stage's video screens, with David Wojnarowicz's \"Falling Buffalo\" photograph appearing at the end of the song.\n\nThe song took on an even more emotional meaning at a Popmart Tour show at Mexico City in 1997, as featured on \"\", where the tearful rendition was dedicated to Michael Hutchence of INXS. Until the second leg of the U2 360° Tour, \"One\" was played live in the key of A minor, while the recorded version is played a semitone higher. Throughout its history, Bono has often sung the song with an extra verse generally known as \"Hear Us Coming\", whose lyrics are usually some variation of:\n<poem>You hear us coming Lord?\nYou hear us call?\nYou hear us knocking, knocking at Your door?\nYou hear us coming, Lord?\nYou hear us call?\nYou hear us scratching, will You make me crawl?</poem>\n\nIt was a nearly-regular feature on the Zoo TV Tour, PopMart, and Elevation Tours, but was sung less often on the Vertigo Tour. The verse made a re-emergence on the 2009 legs of the U2 360° Tour; although it was not a nightly feature, Bono sang it very often, segueing into \"Amazing Grace\" and from there into \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" on most of the second leg. \"One\" has also been played at several benefit concerts, including the 1995 \"Pavarotti and Friends\" concert in Modena, the 1997 Tibetan Freedom Concert in New York, the 2003 46664 concert, at Live 8 in 2005, and with Mary J. Blige on \"\".\n\nLive performances of the song are also depicted in the concert films \"\", \"\", \"\", \"U2 3D\", and \"U2 360° at the Rose Bowl\".\n\nThe single was released on various formats including 7-inch, 12-inch, cassette, and CD. All releases featured a new song \"Lady with the Spinning Head (UV1)\" as a B-side track. This version was later included in the 20th anniversary release of \"Achtung Baby\", whereas an extended 'dance' remix was included on the double album version of \"The Best of 1990–2000\". Some releases also included \"Satellite of Love\" or both \"Satellite of Love\" and the \"Night and Day\" remix.\n\nU2\nAdditional performers\n\nTechnical\n\nBritish soul singer Mica Paris released a cover of \"One\" in 1995.\n\nHer version debuted and peaked at number twenty-nine on the UK Singles Chart on 8 April 1995. It spent a total of four weeks on the chart.\n\nCD single\nVinyl\n\nPerformers\nManagerial\nTechnical and Production\nVisuals and Imagery\n\n\"One\" is the second international single from Mary J. Blige's seventh studio album, \"The Breakthrough\", featuring U2. After being invited to join the group on stage at their New York gig in 2005, Blige performed the track with U2 and received a standing ovation. The song was then recorded featuring Blige on lead vocals, with Bono supplying additional vocals and the band performing the music. It was released on 3 April 2006, having already been featured heavily on BBC Radio 1's playlist, and has been a staple record on Capital FM's playlist since late January. The song was a major commercial success in Europe, reaching number two in Ireland and the United Kingdom and topping the Norwegian Singles Chart for six weeks. The cover also reached number one in Austria for a week and reached the top 10 in several other European countries.\n\nIn May 2006, Blige performed the song at the finale of \"American Idol\" with finalist Elliott Yamin, ahead of its full release to American radio. It was also used by Fox for its end-of-season montage after game five of the 2006 World Series.\n\nCD single\n\n\n\"One\" has been covered by numerous other artists, including Damien Rice, Johnny Logan, Johnny Cash, Adam Lambert, Howie Day, Joe Cocker, Warren Haynes, R.E.M., Gregorian, Pearl Jam, Kendall Payne, Shinedown, Vanessa Paradis & Alain Lanty, Cowboy Junkies and the cast of the television series \"Glee\".\n\nUnder a supergroup label of \"Automatic Baby\" (reflecting the names of then recent releases by both groups), members of R.E.M. and U2 played an acoustic version of the song during a 1993 MTV concert for then newly-inaugurated U.S. president Bill Clinton. In 1997 this version of \"One\" reached number one in Iceland and ended the year as the country's 12th-most-successful single.\n\nDamien Rice reworked the song for the 2011 tribute album \"AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered\". \"I remember seeing the queues on Dublin's Grafton Street: people waiting, sleeping, for the first copies of the new U2 record, as if some famine had hit the soul of the music world,\" he remarked. \"Two decades later, I busked for the homeless with Bono on the same street. We played 'One' and Bono appeared to forget the words, but I didn't – they were as clear to me as the Our Father. Seventeen \"(Rice's age when Achtung Baby was issued)\" is such a powerful age, and 'One' is such a powerful song.\"\n\n\n"}

It is in the south east of the Island, and contains some of the suburbs of Saint Helier. It is the smallest parish by surface area, but the second most densely populated. St. Clement stretches west to east from Le Dicq to within a quarter mile of La Rocque harbour (at the end of Rue de la Lourderie). Its surface area is around .\n\nThe parish is subdivided into three vingtaines, and is administered at local level by the Connétable.\n\nMuch of the parish lies below equinoctial high-tide level and was frequently flooded before Le Dicq was built to try to hold back the sea somewhat. There are remains of a submerged forest underneath the sand at Grève d'Azette that show how the parish has reduced in size as the sea has advanced. Large floods in 1688, 1796 and 1812 led to the coast road at Le Hocq being swept away by the sea and necessitated the coast road being rebuilt further inland.\n\nIn pre-Norman times, the area now known as St. Clement was known as \"Petravilla\" or \"Pierreville\". In 1172 it was recorded that a chapel existed in the parish, and there was a priory on the site of the old Priory Inn (now houses).\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries the parish was believed to be the centre of a witch movement. According to beliefs, the rock at Rocque Berg (known as the Witches' Rock) was the focus for witchcraft in Jersey and witches would assemble there for their sabbats on Friday nights.\n\nAfter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, many French Protestants settled in the parish – as recorded on the church register.\n\nIn the mid 19th century, the town began to spread east from St. Helier into the west of the parish. Today there is relatively little open green space (with the exception of the golf and football fields) west of Samarès Lane into St. Helier.\n\nThe famous French writer Victor Hugo lived in Marina Terrace, St. Clement for some time, and it was here that he wrote his collection of poems entitled \"Les Châtiments\". It was the Connétable of St. Clement at the time who escorted Hugo onto a steamer bound for Guernsey when he had insulted the British Royal Family in some of his letters.\n\nThe parish is divided into vingtaines for administrative purposes as follows:\n\nThe parish forms one electoral district and elects two Deputies.\n\nThe population of St. Clement, according to the 2011 census is 9,221.\n\nAside from the two deputies who sit in the States of Jersey and represent the parish, St. Clement also has its own local administration. This, like each of the other eleven parishes, is made up of a Connétable, who is elected for a three-year term and has a seat in the States Chamber, and on the Comité des Connétables; two Procureurs du Bien Public, who are also elected and oversee the finances of the parish; a Recteur (or Rector), responsible for the parish church; members of the parish Honorary Police (made up of Centeniers, Vingteniers and Constable's Officers); and other officers such as churchwardens, roads inspectors, rates assessors and a registrar. The current Connétable of St. Clement is Mr. Len Norman.\n\nThe seat of the parish administration is the Salle Paroissiale, or Parish Hall, which is pictured above and located at Le Hocq. This is the newest parish hall in the island; the previous parish hall in St. Clement was located at Caldwell Hall, on La Grande Route de St Clément (St. Clement's Inner Road).\n\nSt. Clement has two primary schools and one secondary school within its borders.\n\nLe Rocquier School is a secondary school, on La Grande Route de St Clement. The original school buildings were replaced with a new building in 2006.\n\nThe parish school of St. Clement is located on Rue de la Chapelle, a short distance from Le Rocquier School. The original buildings dates back to 1901, and was replaced in 2006 with a brand new building on the opposite side of the road.\n\nSamarès School (formerly Le Squez School) is the other primary school, which is located further east in School Road.\n\nThe parish church of St. Clement is an ancient place of Anglican worship located on La Grande Route de St Clément (St. Clement's inner road). St. Nicholas is a smaller, sister church, located on La Grande Route de la Côte (the coast road). It was opened in 1927 after being planned, financed and largely built by the Reverend L.B. Lee.\n\nThe St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church is located on La Grande Route de St Clément at Samarès.\n\nThe Samarès Methodist Church is located on La Grande Route de la Côte, and is the southernmost church in the British Isles. However, as of February 2012, there are no longer any religious services at the church, but the church remains open for use as a community centre.\n\nThe dolmen at Mont Ubé (off La Blinerie) is believed to have been left there by a pre-Celtic race called the Iberians, in around 3,000 B.C. Remains of a cemetery on La Motte (Green Island) are believed to be from later settlers. A Neolithic cairn and middens on La Motte have also been investigated.\n\nSamarès Manor (Jèrriais: \"Mangni d'Sanmathès\") is a manor house with medieval origins in the Vingtaine de Samarès, and is the traditional home of the Seigneur de Samarès. The name Samarès is an old French word meaning salt-marsh, and much of the low lying surrounding areas are or were coastal marshes.\n\nLe Hocq Tower was built in 1778 as a coastal defence against the French when they sided with the American colonies against the British.\n\nThe whole rocky inter-tidal zone that stretches along St. Clement's coast from St. Saviour to Grouville is part of a Ramsar site of special significance.\n\nSeymour Tower sits two miles offshore on one of the largest inter-tidal reefs in the world. Built as part of Jersey’s coastal defences, this square tower dates from the 18th century.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was martyred during the Battle of Karbala, and is commemorated in shia as the \"personified quintessence of the innocent victim.\"\n\nHe was born in Medina on the 9th of Rajab, 60 AH. His father's other sons were Imam Zayn al-Abidin and ‘Ali al-Akbar. ‘Abdullah's three sisters were Ruqayyah (Sukainah), Fatimah al-Kubra (Sakinah) and Fatimah al-Sughra.\n\nRubab and her two children, Sakina and Ali Asghar, accompanied Husayn to Karbala. In hagiography about the Battle, Husayn's camp at one time was cut off from water supplies from 7th moharram till Ashura and so Husayn went to Yazid's besieging forces to plead water for the women and children in his camp. Husayn had brought along Ali Asghar for mercy, but Yazid's soldiers then martyred Ali by an arrow to his throat. Shia tradition relates that Ali Asghar was martyred by an opposing soldier named Hurmala with a three-headed arrow, when he moved his neck to stop the arrow from hitting his father. Ali Asghar was only six months old when he died. He is honored by Shia as the youngest person martyred at the Battle of Karbala.\n\nThe massacre at Karbala made Mukhtar al-Thaqafi seek revenge. He led an uprising in which Hurmala and a number of his comrades were killed.\n\nAli al-Asghar is buried along with his brother Ali al-Akbar and his father Husayn in Karbala, Iraq, which is now one of the most visited shrines in the world. Ali al-Asghar and his death are commemorated in various ways, including iconographic depictions, hagiography recitations (\"rowzeh\"), poetry (\"nowheh\"), replicas of Ali Asghar's cradle and grave, and dolls representing him. according to Shia ritual shahadat-e-Ali asghar is on 9th moharram night however, he was killed 71th before imam Husayn. During \"nowheh\", women perform self-flagellating rituals (\"sineh-sarpay\" or \"aza-sarpay\") in which they move around (\"sineh-dowr\") a cradle replica and hit their chests with their hands. In Muharram ceremonies and commemorations, Ali al-Asghar is represented as an innocent child suffering unbearable thirst. His death is mourned at length in \"rawza-khani\" (recital of the \"Rawdat ash-Shuhada\" \"The Paradise of the Martyrs\") literature and in early \"ta'ziya\" (passion play) traditions, a complete majles was dedicated to Ali al-Asghar, with the infant's cradle a conspicuous element on the stage. Ali al-Asghar is also represented in Muharram processions and mourned in folklore.\n\n\n"}

It borders Saint Clement, Saint Saviour and Saint Martin.\n\nThe parish of Grouville shares, with the neighbouring parish of Saint Martin, a dedication to Saint Martin of Tours. The ecclesiastical parish and parish church are dedicated to \"Saint Martin de Grouville\" to distinguish them from the parish of Saint Martin (historically 'Saint Martin le Vieux'). The Church of St Peter la Rocque was built in the 19th century.\n\nThe name 'Grouville' may derive from:\n\n\nThe Royal Bay of Grouville gained its royal epithet when it impressed Queen Victoria during her visit in 1846. The bay is popular with tourists for its broad sandy beach and shallow, warm water. It is also the main oyster producing area of Jersey, and was also formerly noted for the production of vraic. The cottage industry formerly practised by Grouvillais of burning vraic gave rise to the traditional nickname of \"les Enfuntchis\" (the smoky ones, or the dim ones, in Jèrriais) shared by the Grouvillais and their neighbours in St. Clement.\n\nInland, the parish is also home to Jersey's most noted archaeological site at La Hougue Bie, now a museum run by the Jersey Heritage Trust. A prehistoric artificial mound covers a passage grave aligned for the equinox. A mediaeval chapel, Notre Dame de la Clarté, built on the Neolithic mound was converted in the 18th century to a folly-like Gothic Revival residence, the Prince's Tower (demolished in the 1920s). During the Second World War, the occupying German forces constructed bunkers in and alongside the ancient mound, now also transformed for museum interpretation.\n\nLa Rocque was the site of the landing of the French forces on 6 January 1781. The skirmish at La Platte Rocque was ancillary to the Battle of Jersey.\n\nThe Royal Jersey Golf Club, Gorey Village, and Queen's Valley (now flooded to form a reservoir) are situated in the parish.\n\nIn modern times, Grouville has been a popular holiday destination, and features a number of hotels.

Historically it was called \"Saint Martin le Vieux\" to distinguish it from the present day parish of Grouville (historically \"Saint Martin de Grouville\").\n\nSt. Martin is the only parish in Jersey not to conduct its municipal business from a Parish Hall. St. Martin has a Public Hall instead, having accepted money from the States of Jersey to provide an assembly room.\n\nThe dolmens at Le Couperon and Faldouet are among the prehistoric remains in the parish. La Pouquelaye de Faldouet features on the reverse of the Jersey ten pence coin (see \"coins of the Jersey pound\") and was the inspiration for the poem \"Nomen, numen, lumen\" written by Victor Hugo in 1855 during his exile in Jersey.\n\nThe rock known as \"Le Saut Geffroy\", or \"Geoffroy's Leap\", is reputed to be an ancient place of execution where criminals were thrown into the sea. According to folklore, a man named Geffroy was condemned to be thrown into the sea. Remarkably, he survived and climbed back up the cliff face where an argument broke out among the mob of spectators. Some said that sentence had been duly carried out and that Geffroy should go free; others said that sentence had not been properly carried out. To settle the argument, and demonstrate his prowess, Geffroy dived off the rock, but perished on this occasion. Le Saut Geffroy is now preserved by the National Trust for Jersey.\n\nThe ancient castle of Mont Orgueil dominates the small harbour and village of Gorey. The castle served as the island's prison until a prison was constructed in St. Helier in the 17th century. Among agitators imprisoned there by the British government were William Prynne and John Lilburne. Until the construction of Elizabeth Castle off St. Helier at the beginning of the 17th century, Mont Orgueil was generally the residence of the Governor of Jersey.\n\nThe 600m breakwater at St. Catherine is all that remains of a grandiose harbour project started, but then abandoned, by the British government in the 19th century. It is now a popular site for sea anglers.\n\nSt. Martin is one of the remaining strongholds of Jèrriais with a distinctive accent. The area around Faldouet formerly possessed a dialect of its own, known as Faldouais, of which the distinctive feature was the realisation of intervocalic /r/ as /z/. Although the Faldouais dialect is extinct, it has left notable amounts of writings in Jèrriais literature.\n\nThe artist Edmund Blampied was born at Ville Brée on 30 March 1886.\n\nThis is one of the most agricultural parishes, and one of the most sought after places to live in the island.

{"id": "2233335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233335", "title": "Tone control circuit", "text": "Tone control circuit\n\nTone control is a type of equalization used to make specific pitches or \"frequencies\" in an audio signal softer or louder. It allows a listener to adjust the tone of the sound produced by an audio system to their liking, for example to compensate for inadequate bass response of loudspeakers or earphones, tonal qualities of the room, or hearing impairment. A tone control circuit is an electronic circuit that consists of a network of filters which modify the signal before it is fed to speakers, headphones or recording devices by way of an amplifier. Tone controls are found on many sound systems: radios, portable music players, boomboxes, public address systems, and musical instrument amplifiers.\n\nTone control allows listeners to adjust sound to their liking. It also enables them to compensate for recording deficiencies, hearing impairments, room acoustics or shortcomings with playback equipment. For example, older people with hearing problems may want to increase the loudness of high pitch sounds they have difficulty hearing. \n\nTone control is also used to adjust an audio signal during recording. For instance, if the acoustics of the recording site cause it to absorb some frequencies more than others, tone control can be used to amplify or \"boost\" the frequencies the room dampens.\n\nIn their most basic form, tone control circuits attenuate the high or low frequencies of the signal. This is called treble or bass \"cut\". The simplest tone control circuits are passive circuits which utilize only resistors and capacitors or inductors. They rely on the property of capacitive reactance or inductive reactance to inhibit or enhance an AC signal, in a frequency-dependent manner. Active tone controls may also amplify or \"boost\" certain frequencies. More elaborate tone control circuits can boost or attenuate the middle range of frequencies. \n\nThe simplest tone control is a single knob that when turned in one direction enhances treble frequencies and the other direction enhances bass frequencies. This was the first type of tone control, typically found on radios and record players from the 1930s to the 1970s.\n\nGraphic equalizers used for tone control provide independent elevation or attenuation of individual bands of frequencies. Wide frequency range graphic equalizers of high resolution can provide elevation or attenuation in 1/3 octave bands spanning from approximately 30 Hz to 18 kHz.\nParametric equalizers can control not only the amount of boost and cut but also the specific frequency at which the boost and cut takes place and the range of frequencies (bandwidth) affected.\n\nElaborate circuits may also use amplifiers. The most modern analog units use operational amplifiers, resistors and capacitors, abandoning inductors because of their size and sensitivity to ubiquitous electromagnetic interference.\n\nHistorically, tone control was achieved via analog electronics, and most tone control circuits produced today still use the analog process. Nonetheless, digital approaches are increasingly being implemented through the use of digital signal processing.\n\n\n\nNB.

It was the first ever company granted license to carry out cellular phone services in Pakistan, set up by Cable & Wireless. It carried out AMPS services until 2004 when the company switched to GSM technology.\n\nPaktel offered only mobile telephony service to its 2 million subscriber base. As of 2007, Paktel was ranked fifth mobile player of Pakistani market owing to low subscriber base and market share. After the completion of its acquisition by China Mobile, Paktel was rebranded Zong Pakistan on April 1, 2008.\n\nCable & Wireless with his local partner Hasan Group of Companies (major local team was consisting on Farooq Hasan, R A Zuberi, Shahid Mahmud, Syed Ahmed Ali, Qazi Abdul Wahid & Dewan) launched commercial service Paktel in 1990. Paktel was granted a license in early 1990 to operate a cellular telephone network throughout Pakistan. It was the first company granted a free license to carry out cellular phone services in Pakistan. It carried out AMPS services until 2004.\n\nPaktel Mediation and Billing System was developed by a team consisting of Syed Ahmed Ali, Nadeem Usmani, Wasay Farooqi, and Ali Korani. It was first mediation software in the region which was developed locally and also the first cellular Billing System ever. Millicom owned Instaphone merged as its competitor in the late 1990s and began to dominate the market share. With the launch of Mobilink and its rapid success in 1998, both Instaphone and Paktel floundered and lost their dominant market share. It was followed by the acquisition of Cable & Wireless owned Paktel by Millicom, the majority owners of Instaphone.\n\nIn November 2000, Millicom acquired 98.9% equity interest in Paktel. Millicom installed a new management team headed by John Tumelty, former CEO of Instaphone, and Chief Financial Officer David Ordman.\n\nIn April 2001, Paktel launched prepaid services under the brand \"Tango\". The manager of this brand was Mr Amees Ahmad.\n\nIn October 2002, Paktel was granted a modification to its license, allowing it to operate a GSM based network and the Frequency Allocation Board of Pakistan thereby awarded the necessary frequencies. Paktel was awarded additional 1800 MHz spectrum, increasing total spectrum for GSM network from 10 MHz to 13.6 MHz. After obtaining frequencies Paktel launched GSM network in October 2004.\n\nOn October 23, 2004, Paktel agreed with Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to launch GSM network with immediate effect and renew their\n\nlicense for 15 years from October 23, 2004 for a license fee of $291,000,000. This agreement was signed by the two parties on October 25, 2004. Paktel and the PTA agreed delayed payment terms under which 50% of the license fee will be paid in installments over the first three years of the license. The second 50% of the license fee will be payable in ten yearly payments from 2008 to 2017.\n\nIn March 31, 2005, Paktel held approximately 340,000 GSM subscribers and its network comprised 300 cell sites, covering about 45% of the population. By November 2005, Paktel had 1 million customer base and a market share of 9%, with subscriber count increasing at a rate of 100,000 per month.\n\nIn November 2006, Millicom announced that it had decided to exit the Pakistani market. Pakistani authorities had refused to delay payment of a $29 million licence installment and had not given Paktel permanent access to part of the frequency spectrum. Announcing its pullout, Millicom said it decided against making significant investments in Pakistan because of tough market conditions. It had already sold Instaphone to a local telecom company \"Arfeen Group\" in October 2005 and was looking for potential buyers for Paktel.\n\nInitially Kuwait based the then MTC showed an interest for buy-out. But it was the China Mobile who won the bid.\n\nOn January 22, 2007, Millicom International Cellular S.A. stated that it would sell its 88.86 percent stake in Paktel to China Mobile for $284 million, which includes the repayment of intercompany debt. The sale implies an enterprise value for Paktel of $460 million, Millicom said in its press release. Merrill Lynch advised China Mobile on the transaction.\n\nOn 4 May 2007, Paktel Limited was renamed to China Mobile Pakistan. On May 16, 2007 China Mobile announced that it had increased its stake in CMPak to 100%.\n\nChina Mobile Pakistan continued to operator under Paktel brand until March 31, 2007. After acquisition, China Mobile Pakistan invested more than US$700 million in the telecom sector in Pakistan and US$800 million were further invested by the end of year 2008.\n\nPakistan Telecommunication Authority said that it might resolve the frequency issue with China Mobile, as it was one of the main reason for pullout by Millicom International Cellular S.A. According to the statistics from the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, Paktel had 2.145 million customers at the end of February 2008.\n\nOn April 1, 2008, Paktel was rebranded to Zong. China Mobile Pakistan organised a launch event on April 5.\n\nPaktel's entire network that included network base stations, GSM core, SMS, microwave links, IT support, and transmission towers was based on GSM network infrastructure from ZTE. ZTE also provided Paktel consumers with missed call and welcome messages features at that time.\n\nPaktel used the following numbering schemes:\nWhere, 92 is the ISD code for Pakistan and is required when dialling outside the country, 303 and 304 were prefixes for Paktel once AMPS and GSM customers respectively allocated by Pakistan Telecommunication Authority. Omitting +92 would require 0 instead to represent local call, hence 0303 and 0304 were the general prefixes and NNNNNNN was the subscriber number. After being rebranded as Zong, the code was changed to 031x whereas 0303 and 0304 were taken over by Mobilink.\n\nPaktel offered prepaid and postpaid plans. It was initially offering only postpaid services with PKR 5000 (approximately $23 at that time) as initial security deposit. The call data was used to be stored on magnetic tapes, sent to the United Kingdom for printing and bills were then dispatched to the customers after a delay of 45 days. This ensued in non-payments from many defaulters who fled away after using and receiving heavy bills. The call rate was charged to both the caller and the receiver alike. In April 2001, prepaid brand \"Tango\" was launched under the management of Mr Amees Ahmad.\n\nPaktel had customer service centres in major cities and country-wide network of franchises further backed by retail channels.\n\nPaktel was the first company to waive off national roaming and incoming calls charges to compete with the rival Mobilink and Ufone. Later it uncovered another offer, the country's first offer of its kind – free credit on receiving incoming calls per minute basis.

The parish and its eponymous church derive their name from a medieval monastery, probably destroyed during Viking raids some time between the 8th and 10th centuries. In 1042 Duke William gave \"Saint Mary of the Burnt Monastery\" to the abbey of Cerisy.\n\nAmong the natural attractions of the parish is a feature known as the Devil's Hole (Lé Creux du Vis), a blowhole in the cliffs of the coast. The descent from the car park to the Devil's Hole is a popular tourist attraction, with the walk taking approximately ten minutes. The upper part of the path is surfaced, and the lower part, once quite dangerous in parts, now has wooden steps and handrails, with much of the access having been improved by a working party from the Royal Engineers Corps of the British Army. In Victorian times it was possible to descend into the hole itself at low tide, but this is no longer possible. However, the access path ends at a large specially constructed viewing platform. Following a shipwreck in 1851, when the ship's figurehead washed up in the Devil's Hole, a statue of a devil adapted from the figurehead was set up above the Hole. This wooden statue was replaced by a succession of modern versions in the 20th century.\n\nMourier Valley runs down the boundary between Saint Mary and Saint John. The stream formerly powered a number of mills despite the scant population of the area.\n\nCrabbé is the location for pistol shooting.\n\nLa Grève de Lecq lies on the border between Saint Mary and Saint Ouen. On the east side of the bay, in Saint Mary, lies Le Castel de Lecq, a mediaeval earthwork. In the bay Le Moulin de Lecq, an old watermill, was converted into a residence in 1929 and following the Second World War became a pub, while retaining the wheel and remnants of the gears.\n\nThe parish stands upon coarse-grained granite, 'of Saint Mary's type', which formed during the lower Palaeozoic period. This granite was formerly quarried for building.\n\nSaint Mary is twinned with Longues-sur-Mer, a commune of the département of Calvados, in the Normandy région of France.\n\nThe parish is divided into vingtaines for administrative purposes as follows:\n\nThe parish forms one electoral district and elects one Deputy.\n\nSt. Mary has the smallest population of all the parishes in Jersey, having only 1,591 residents in 2001.\n\n\n"}

It is in the north west of Jersey. The parish is the largest parish by surface area, covering 8,341 vergées (15 km²).\n\nIt is reputed to be the most traditional of the parishes, being the farthest from Saint Helier and with much of the territory of the parish forming a peninsula. Its manor, Saint Ouen's Manor, the seat of the de Carteret family for over eight centuries - is the senior fief in the island, and the influence of that family has also been a factor in the parish's independent-minded approach to its affairs.\n\nA number of the most influential writers of Jersey have been St. Ouennais. George F. Le Feuvre (1891–1984), who wrote under the pseudonym \"George d'la Forge\", was one of the most prolific authors of Jèrriais literature of the 20th century. Frank Le Maistre (1910–2002), compiler of the \"Dictionnaire Jersiais-Français\" (1966), did much to standardise the St. Ouennais dialect of Jèrriais as a literary language. Edward Le Brocq (1877–1964) wrote a weekly newspaper column from 1946 to 1964 recounting the lives and opinions of two St. Ouennais characters, Ph'lip and Merrienne.\n\nThe traditional nickname for St. Ouennais is \"Gris Ventres\" (grey bellies) - a reference to the custom of men from the parish to wear jerseys of undyed wool, which distinguished them from men from other parishes who generally wore blue.\n\nA number of prehistoric sites are located in St. Ouen, including the dolmen des Monts Grantez, located at Le Chemin des Monts; the dolmen des Geonnais; and the prehistoric site at Le Pinacle, which also contains one of the very few identifiable Gallo-Roman sites to be seen in Jersey, the foundations of a \"fanum\" (small temple).\n\nSark was recolonised by St. Ouennais. Helier de Carteret, the seigneur of the parish, received a charter from Queen Elizabeth I to colonise Sark with 40 families from the parish on condition that he maintain the island free of pirates. Sercquiais is therefore a very old offshoot of St Ouennais Jèrriais. The St. Ouennais origins of Sercquiais can be seen in the 2nd and 3rd person plural forms of the preterite. Sercquiais uses an ending \"-dr\" which is typical of the St. Ouennais dialect of Jèrriais, but generally not used elsewhere in Jersey (nor nowadays by younger speakers in St. Ouen).\n\nIn the north west, the ruins of Grosnez Castle are a landmark which also features on the Jersey 50 pence coin (see \"coins of the Jersey pound\").\n\nThe Island's racecourse is also to be found at Les Landes.\n\nUnlike the other parishes of Jersey, the subdivisions of this parish are not named \"vingtaines\", but \"cueillettes\" (Jèrriais: \"tchilliettes\"). Vingteniers are still elected, however, in the cueillettes.\n\n\nSaint Ouen forms one electoral district and elects one Deputy.\n\nLes Landes School is a primary school, run by the States of Jersey, and located on La Rue des Cosnets, in Saint Ouen.\n\nSaint Ouen's local football team is St. Ouen F.C.\n"}

After his father died of cancer in 1960, the Powells returned to the United States to settle in Jacksonville, Florida. In elementary school, Powell met Leon Wilkeson, who became a lifelong friend and the bassist for Lynyrd Skynyrd. Powell took an interest in piano and he began taking piano lessons from a local teacher named Madalyn Brown, who claimed that Billy did not need a teacher as he was a natural and picked things up well on his own. When it was time for high school, his mother enrolled Billy and his brother, Ricky, at Sanford Naval Academy in Sanford, Florida. Powell returned to Jacksonville, where he enrolled at Bishop Kenny High School. After graduation in 1970, he enrolled at and briefly attended a community college, majoring in music theory.\n\nAround 1970, Powell found work as a roadie for Lynyrd Skynyrd and remained a member of the Skynyrd crew for two years, during which the band secured a support role for the band Mountain. In 1972, Skynyrd played a show at the Bolles School prom. During a break at that event, Powell sat down at a piano and launched into his piano-based version of \"Free Bird\". When the band realized their roadie's ability, he was offered the position of keyboardist.\nJimmy Johnson, studio guitarist known for being a member of The Swampers, said Billy played his version of Freebird when the band took a lunch break while recording what would become Skynyrds First...and Last. The band returned from lunch to hear Billy playing and a few weeks later he was offered a full position in the band.\n\nIn 1973, Lynyrd Skynyrd was signed to MCA Records and received national exposure following the release of their first album, \"(pronounced 'lĕh-'nérd 'skin-'nérd)\". The band's popularity soared in 1974 with their follow-up album, \"Second Helping\", which featured their highest-charting single, \"Sweet Home Alabama\". The band enjoyed increasing popularity over the next three years, culminating in the 1977 release of \"Street Survivors\".\n\nThree days after the release of \"Street Survivors\", Skynyrd's chartered Convair CV-240 crashed into a forest near McComb, Mississippi. The crash took the lives of singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines, his sister and backing vocalist Cassie Gaines, assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, and both pilots. The remainder of the band suffered mild to severe injuries. Powell suffered severe facial lacerations, almost losing his nose, but was otherwise relatively uninjured. He was the first to be released from the hospital, and the only member able to attend the funerals of his fallen bandmates.\n\nDuring the time between the plane crash and the Lynyrd Skynyrd reunion in 1987, Powell joined a Christian rock band, Vision, in 1984, recorded three albums (\"Mountain in The Sky\", \"Vision\", and \"Streetfighter\"), and toured extensively. His keyboard performances were spotlighted in Vision concerts. During the concerts, Powell spoke about his newfound Christianity; messages that were also delivered via two bonus tracks (Leon Wilkeson and Billy Powell) included on the album \"Mountain in The Sky\".\n\nPowell rejoined Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1987 for a tribute tour, and remained with the band until his death. At the time of his death, he and guitarist Gary Rossington were the only members from the classic lineup who were active in the band.\n\nIn 2007, two years before his death, Powell played piano on Kid Rock's summer anthem All Summer Long.\n\nOn January 28, 2009, Powell died at the age of 56 at his home in Orange Park, Florida. It was during a break from Skynyrd's touring schedule that Powell suffered a fatal heart attack. His passing inspired countless tributes, in and out of the Southern rock community and extending across the country-music world, where he had many friends and admirers. The music he had recorded with Vision was played exclusively at a private memorial service, and Kid Rock sang a tribute. Many Southern Rock musicians were in attendance, including his Skynyrd and Vision bandmates, their families, Hank Williams Jr. and others. He was survived by his wife Ellen, sons Brandon and Joel, daughters Layla, Ashley, and Maggie, brother Rick, and sister Donna.\n\nThe song \"Gifted Hands\" was later written and recorded by Lynyrd Skynyrd as a tribute to Powell.\n\n"}

Originally published by the Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG), it is currently published under licence by Crafty Games.\n\nOriginally envisioned—and initially publicised—as a paranormal superspy game called \"Series Archer\", the game was split into 2 complementary product lines: \"Spycraft\" (silver trade dress) which devoted itself to a generic cinematic superspy/action setting, and \"Shadowforce Archer\" (black trade dress) which featured a setting focused on a global shadow conspiracy based on a wide variety of supernatural elements. After the release of the core book (subsequently referred to as the \"Spycraft Espionage Handbook\") in 2002, multiple print supplements were released in the following years for both lines. Each of these books sported highly distinctive cover art by artist Veronica V. Jones.\n\nA new edition of the rules, \"Spycraft 2.0\", was released in August 2005. Shortly afterwards, economic issues forced AEG to cull Spycraft from its product range. As a result, early in 2006 the core authors of the 2nd edition – Alex Flagg, Scott Gearin and Patrick Kapera (who also co-authored \"Spycraft 1.0\")) – formed Crafty Games to continue the line under licence, predominantly through PDF file releases supported by strategic print releases. This model has changed over time, permitting a growing number of print releases including compilations of previous PDF releases. During this time Crafty Games began referring to Spycraft 1.0 as \"Classic Spycraft\".\n\n\n\nClassic Spycraft is a d20 System game, implementing a number of changes to the core mechanics in order to give a more contemporary feel:\n\n\nSpycraft 2.0 took these changes a step further and was released under the Open Game Licence (OGL), but not the d20 System Trademark License. There were also numerous changes from Classic Spycraft, such as:\n\n\nThe first of all the Spycraft campaign settings. The world of Shadowforce Archer (SFA) is an Earth where mystical and psionic powers are real. A series of supplemental books that were released to support the SFA worldbook. Each book details one of the international Chambers of the world. Each book has a different theme and includes new rules and agent options appropriate to the theme. The setting was discontinued at the beginning of 2005. Spycraft 2.0 contains many classes and feats that first appeared in the SFA line.\n\nThe Shadowforce Archer World Book has recently been re-released in PDF format by Crafty Games. The rest of the SFA line will also be made available in PDF format throughout the rest of the year (and possibly into the next).\n\n\nReleased in 2004 by Mythic Dreams Studios, Dark Inheritance (DI) was originally a d20 Modern campaign setting but converted across to the \"Powered by Spycraft\" banner using the Classic Spycraft rules. It describes an Earth that has been ravaged by ancient mystical powers, allowing Demons and other foul beasts access to this dimension. The setting book contains new rules that allow agents to play as Titans (powerful descendants of antediluvian demi-gods), worship the demonic forces and gain access to mystic powers (reprinted from the SFA world book).\n\nThere are a number of supplements planned for DI, similar in fashion to those for SFA. There is no release date as yet for any of these supplements.\n\nReleased in December 2007, \"World On Fire\" is the title of the world book that covers the setting detailed in the Spycraft CCG. Agents are able to fight the forces of evil alongside such groups as the Shadow Patriots and Banshee.Net. The book features even more character options (in the form of new origins, base and expert classes, and new master classes for higher level characters). New classes include the Ace, the Centurion, the Edgemaster, the Fixer, the Forward, the Goliath, the High Roller, the Martial Artist, the Medic, the Menace, the Mole, the Ninja, the Provocateur, the Saboteur, the Spin Doctor, the Street Knight, and the Terrorist.\n\nFantasy Craft was released in both hardcover and PDF formats in 2009 through the Flaming Cobra imprint of Mongoose Publishing. Following Crafty Games' parting with Mongoose, a soft-covered second printing incorporating the errata generated up to that point was released in 2010.\n\nOriginally the game was intended for release as an expansion of the Spycraft 2.0 ruleset, following up the first two Origin of the Species electronic products that added character creation options for a variety of standard fantasy and classical Greek non-humans to the ruleset. During the development process, the decision was made by Crafty Games to instead take the opportunity to significantly streamline the game mechanics in response to user feedback and create the ruleset referred to as \"Mastercraft\". This permitted the release of Fantasy Craft as a standalone product under the Open Gaming Licence, including full rules for character generation, conversion mechanics for monsters found in the System Resource Document, and the tools for creating, populating and presenting user-generated campaign settings to players.\n\nFantasy Craft was nominated in 2010 for an Origins award for best RPG and an ENnie for Best Writing; it also received an honorable mention at that year's ENnies for Product of the Year.\n\n2010 also saw two further Fantasy Craft soft-covered print products, both of which reprinted previously electronically published material. The first was Time of High Adventure, which compiled the previously published \"The Darkest Hour\" and \"Cleansing of Black Spur\" and added a third original mission as well as a chapter expanding upon the implied setting of all three modules. This was followed up by the Adventure Companion, which contained 3 campaign settings originally intended for release as part of the core book before being cut for space, and a fourth chapter offering a number of new game mechanic options, including a compilation of the non-spellcasting \"Call to Arms\" character class releases, some additional classes and a small library of additional specialities, feats and tricks.\n\nA fourth print release titled Spellbound is currently slated for publication. In addition to compiling the spellcasting \"Call to Arms\" character class releases, its content is focused on greatly expanding the mechanical and narrative options for magic use in a Fantasy Craft game.\n\nLong teased on the Spycraft forums under the name 'Project X', \"Ten Thousand Bullets\" is a gritty crime setting intended to bring Spycraft down to street level with new rules to allow players to become police, gangsters and everything in between. Originally intended for release at Gen Con Indy 2007, the creative process behind Fantasy Craft has resulted in its being slated for release as a Mastercraft title.\n\n\"Spycraft\" has a long history with organized play and living campaigns. For 5 years \"Spycraft\" could be played as part of the \"Living Spycraft\" campaign, which was a part of the RPGA (Role Playing Game Association) network of Living Campaign settings.\n\nThe \"Living Spycraft\" campaign had been in the planning stages for a while before RPGA approval was provided on 29 August 2002 with the campaign starting properly in October 2002 utilising the, then current, Classic Spycraft rules. In 2005 the campaign converted to the Spycraft 2.0 rules but, at the end of 2007, \"Crafty Games\" ended the campaign although the original campaign scenarios are still available as free downloads. A number of volunteers who ran the \"Living Spycraft\" campaign restarted it independently as \"Spymaster\" but this campaign ceased in 2010. Likewise, in 2008 a UK-only campaign, called \"For Queen & Country\", started. This campaign utilises a version of Classic Spycraft that incorporates aspects of Spycraft 2.0.\n\n\nCrafty Games has re-released the first edition books in PDF format. The first two PDF releases, the \"Spycraft Espionage Handbook\" and \"Shadowforce Archer\" came with a Conversion Document that allows owners to use the material with Spycraft 2.0.\n\nThere are currently 28 supplements available for the new version of Spycraft (21 from Crafty Games and 6 licensed products).\n\n\nThe Spycraft system was used in the Stargate SG-1 role-playing game. This has often been referred to as Spycraft 1.5 due to some small changes that were made to the Spycraft 1.0 rules and were subsequently incorporated into Spycraft 2.0, such as Gear Picks.\n\n"}

{"id": "2233425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233425", "title": "Aldrin", "text": "Aldrin\n\nAldrin is an organochlorine insecticide that was widely used until the 1990s, when it was banned in most countries. Aldrin is a member of the so-called \"classic organochlorines\" (COC) group of pesticides. COCs enjoyed a very sharp rise in popularity during and after The Second World War. Other noteworthy examples of COCs include DDT. After research showed that organochlorines can be highly toxic to the ecosystem through bioaccumulation, most were banned from use. It is a colourless solid. Before the ban, it was heavily used as a pesticide to treat seed and soil. Aldrin and related \"cyclodiene\" pesticides (a term for pesticides derived from Hexachlorocyclopentadiene) became notorious as persistent organic pollutants.\n\nThe structure formula of aldrin is CHCl. The molecule has a molecular weight of 364.896 g/mol. The melting point of aldrin is a temperature of 105 °C and the octanol-water partition coefficient is 6.5 (logP).\n\nPure aldrin takes form as a white crystalline powder. Though it is not soluble in water (0.003%% solubility), aldrin dissolves very well in organic solvents, such as ketones and paraffins. Aldrin decays very slowly once released into the environment. Though it is rapidly converted to dieldrin by plants and bacteria, dieldrin maintains the same toxic effects and slow decay of aldrin. Aldrin is easily transported through the air by dust particles. Aldrin does not react with mild acids or bases and is stable in an environment with a pH between 4 and 8. It is highly flammable when exposed to temperatures above 200 °C In the presence of oxidizing agents aldrin reacts with concentrated acids and phenols.\n\nAldrin is not formed in nature. It is synthesized by combining hexachlorocyclopentadiene with norbornadiene in a Diels-Alder reaction to give the adduct. In 1967, the composition of technical-grade aldrin was reported to consist of 90.5% of hexachlorohexahydrodimethanonaphthalene (HHDN).\n\nSimilarly, an isomer of aldrin, known as isodrin, is produced by reaction of hexachloronobornadiene with cyclopentadiene. Isodrin is also produced as a byproduct of aldrin synthesis, with technical-grade aldrin containing about 3,5% isodrin.\n\nAldrin is named after the German chemist Kurt Alder, one of the coinventors of this kind of reaction. An estimated 270 million kilograms of aldrin and related cyclodiene pesticides were produced between 1946 and 1976.\n\nThere are multiple available forms of aldrin. One of these is the isomer isodrin, which cannot be found in nature, but needs to be synthesized like aldrin. When aldrin enters the human body or the environment it is rapidly converted to dieldrin. Degradation by ultraviolet radiation or microbes can convert dieldrin to photodieldrin and aldrin to photoaldrin.\n\nEven though many toxic effects of aldrin have been discovered, the exact mechanisms underlying the toxicity are yet to be determined. The only toxic aldrin induced process that is largely understood is that of neurotoxicity.\n\nOne of the effects that intoxication with aldrin gives rise to is neurotoxicity. Studies have shown that aldrin stimulates the central nervous system (CNS), which may cause hyperexcitation and seizures. This phenomenon exerts its effect through two different mechanisms.\n\nOne of the mechanisms uses the ability of aldrin to inhibit brain calcium ATPases. These ion pumps relieve the nerve terminal from calcium by actively pumping it out. However, when aldrin inhibits these pumps, the intracellular calcium levels rise. This results in an enhanced neurotransmitter release.\n\nThe second mechanism makes use of aldrin's ability to block gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity. GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Aldrin induces neurotoxic effects by blocking the GABA receptor-chloride channel complex. By blocking this receptor, chloride is unable to move into the synapse, which prevents hyperpolarization of neuronal synapses. Therefore, the synapses are more likely to generate action potentials.\n\nThe metabolism of oral aldrin exposure has not been studied in humans. However, animal studies are able to provide an extensive overview of the metabolism of aldrin. This data can be related to humans.\n\nBiotransformation of aldrin starts with epoxidation of aldrin by mixed-function oxidases (CYP-450), which forms dieldrin. This conversion happens mainly in the liver. Tissues with low CYP-450 expression use the prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (PES) instead. This oxidative pathway bisdioxygenises the arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G (PGG). Subsequently, PGG is reduced to prostaglandin H (PGH) by hydroperoxidase.\n\nDieldrin can then be directly oxidized by cytochrome oxidases, which forms 9-hydroxydieldrin. An alternative for oxidation involves the opening of the epoxied ring by epoxied hydrases, which forms the product 6,7-trans-dihydroxydihydroaldrin. Both products can be conjugated to form 6,7-trans-dihydroxydihydroaldrin glucuronide and 9-hydroxydieldrin glucuronide, respectively. 6,7-trans-dihydroxydihydroaldrin can also be oxidized to form aldrin dicarboxylic acid.\n\nConsidering the toxicokinetics of aldrin in the environment, the efficacy of the compound has been determined. In addition, the adverse effects after exposure to the aldrin are demonstrated, indicating the risk regarding the compound.\n\nThe ability of aldrin, in its use for the control of termites, is examined in order to determine the maximum response when applied. In 1953 US researchers tested aldrin and dieldrin on terrains with rats known to carry chiggers, at a rate of 2.25 pound per acre. The Aldrin and Dieldrin treatment demonstrated a decrease of 75 times less chiggers on rats for Dieldrin treated terrains and 25 times less chiggers on the rats when treated with Aldrin.  The Aldrin treatment indicate a high productivity, especially in comparison to other insecticide that were used, like DDT, Sulfur or BHC.\n\nExposure of Aldrin to the environment leads to the localization of the chemical compound in the air, soil, and water. Aldrin gets changed quickly to dieldrin and that compound degrades slowly, which accounts for aldrin concentrations in the environment around the primary exposure and in the plants. These concentrations can also be found in animals, which eat contaminated plants or animals that reside in the contaminated water. This biomagnification can lead to a high concentrations in their fat.\n\nThere are some reported cases of workers who developed anemia after multiple dieldrin exposures. However the main adverse effect of Aldrin and Dieldrin is in relationship to the central nervous system. The accumulated levels of Dieldrin in the body were believed to lead to convulsions. Besides that other symptoms were also reported like headaches, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, muscle twitching and myoclonic jerking and EEG distortions. In all these cases removal of the source of exposure to aldrin/dieldrin led to a rapid recovery.\n\nThe toxicity of aldrin and dieldrin is determined by the results of several animal studies. Reports of a significant increase in workers death in relation to aldrin has not been found, although death by anemia is reported in some cases after multiple exposure to Aldrin. Immunological tests linked an antigenic response to erythrocytes coated with dieldrin in those cases. Direct dose-response relations being a cause for death are yet to be examined.\n\nThe NOAEL that was derived from rat studies:\n\n\nIn addition to these studies, breast cancer risk studies were performed demonstrating a significant increased breast cancer risk. After comparing blood concentrations to number of lymph nodes and tumor size a 5-fold higher risk of death was determined, comparing the highest quartile range in the research to the lower quartile range. Young children are also more susceptible to the drug, causing severe generalized convulsions.\n\nMost of the animal studies done with aldrin and dieldrin used rats.  High doses of aldrin and dieldrin demonstrated neurotoxicity, but in multiple rat studies also showed a unique sensitivity of the mouse liver to dieldrin induced hepatocarcinogenicity. Furthermore, Aldrin treated rats demonstrated an increased post-natal mortality, in which adults showed an increased susceptibility to the compounds compared to children in rats.\n\nLike related polychlorinated pesticides, aldrin is highly lipophilic. Its solubility in water is only 0.027 mg/L, which exacerbates its persistence in the environment. It was banned by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. In the U.S., aldrin was cancelled in 1974. The substance is banned from use for plant protection by the EU.\n\nAldrin has rat of 39 to 60 mg/kg (oral in rats).

The island of Guernsey and the other Channel Islands represent the last remnants of the medieval Duchy of Normandy.\n\nThe Guernésiais nickname for people from St Sampson is \"roînes\" (frogs).\n\nThe parish is divided into two non-contiguous sections, the bulk of the parish lying on the east coast, with a smaller section lying on the west coast. The parish of Vale borders the parish to the north and also extends between the two parts of St. Sampson.\n\nWhat is currently the northern boundary of the parish originally ran along the south coast of Le Braye du Valle, a tidal channel that made the northern extremity of Guernsey, Le Clos du Valle, a tidal island.\n\nLa Braye du Valle was drained and reclaimed in 1806 by the British Government as a defence measure. The eastern end of the former channel became the town and harbour (from 1820) of St. Sampson's, now the second biggest port in Guernsey. The western end of La Braye is now Le Grand Havre. The roadway called The Bridge across the end of the harbour at St. Sampson's recalls the bridge that formerly linked the two parts of Guernsey at high tide.\n\nThe postal code for street addresses in this parish begins with GY2.\n\nThe parish church of St. Sampson claims to be the oldest of Guernsey's parish churches, standing on the coast where Samson of Dol arrived from Brittany in the sixth century, intending to convert Islanders to Christianity. The church was consecrated on 22 May 1111 by the Bishop of Coutances.\n\nSt Sampson is the Patron Saint of Guernsey\n\nIn 1814 there were 125 dwellings, housing 788 residents of Saint Sampson. The parish providing 1/13th of all taxes collected in Guernsey.\n\nHarbour facilities improved as trade using the harbour increased. In 1822, 7,000 tons of granite cobbles were exported in 90 ships. By 1836 annual exports had increased to 57,584 tons. In 1841 the south quay was completed and by 1851, 542 ships were using the harbour each year. By 1861 granite exports had risen to 142,866 tons on 737 ships. Today the harbour is used for non-containerised freight, including liquid and gas fuel.\n\nShipbuilding took place in Saint Sampson, from local trading craft to a tea clipper called \"Golden Spur\" and a steamship, the \"Commerce\" built in 1874. The \"Lydia\", a local 173 ton brig, sailed in March 1853 from Saint Sampson to Adelaide with 60 emigrants, it took 132 days.\n\nTrams used to run from Saint Sampson to Saint Peter Port from 1879, taking over from a horse-drawn bus that had started operation in 1837. Originally the trams were steam powered, changing to electric in 1891 and continuing in service until 1934.\n\nThe features of the parish include:\nThe parish of St. Sampson hosts:\nPrior to the States decision to introduce Island Wide Voting St Sampson comprised the whole of the St Sampson administrative division\n\nIn the 2016 Guernsey general election there was a 3,509 or 78% turnout to elect six Deputies.

Beginning in the 1830s and lasting until 1918, dhol-tasha was taken around the world by Indian workers, mostly from present-day Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, enmeshed in a global scheme of indentured labor in British, French, and Dutch territories.\n\nTassa is a drum ensemble with ancient Persian origins, also known as \"Taash\" or \"Taasha\" drums. These drums disseminated to India with the Mughal migration, and from India spread worldwide with the Indian diaspora. The tassa drum proper is a conical or bowl shaped nagaara (aka nagada, or nagaada) type drum which is played with a heavy bass drum called dhol, or simply “bass”, and brass cymbals or metal shakers called jhaanj or jhaal (Hindi/Sanskrit). Tassa-dhol ensembles of three to five players are especially common in street processions, whether associated with Indian weddings, political rallies, Hindu festivals, or Muslim festivals, especially Muharram (known as \"Hosay\" in Trinidad, a colloquialization of \"Hussain\"). In Maharashtra, ensembles of several dozen drummers compete in festivities honoring the deity Ganesh. Drummers in these ensembles are often amateurs, or specialists in other drum traditions. Brought by indentured workers to the Caribbean, Fiji, Mauritius, and Africa in the 19th century, tassa ensembles have flourished with great dynamism in Trinidad and Tobago, where they were used in the Hindu Phagwah, Muslim Hosay festival, and also in Florida, Guyana, New York, Suriname, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Texas, New Jersey, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and various other places where Indo-Caribbean communities are found.\n\nTraditionally, the tassa is made by tightly covering a clay shell with goat skin, using an intricate, archaic process. The hides of monkey, deer, and horse are periodically used. When ready to play, the goat skin is heated by aid of a fire to tighten the head, making the pitch higher. This process is called \"standing it up\". In this way, the pitch can stay high for 20–30 minutes, until the heat dissipates from both the skin and the inside of the drum. Contemporary tassa drums are made by cutting an empty coolant tank or buoy in half and attaching a synthetic drum skin to the top of it with nuts and bolts, welding it shut. Synthetic drums do last longer and do not have to be adjusted as frequently. Although synthetic drums last longer, they deviate from the long-standing tradition of clay and goatskin and, according to some connoisseurs and aficionados, do not sound as well due to its limited range of pitch and cold, metallic, twangy tones.\n\nBass drums are usually constructed from a single piece of tree trunk, usually mango or cedar, which is hollowed out by either lathe or hand. Older, larger drums were made of the dense but light weight cottonwood tree which is rarely found today. Some bass drum shells are made of maple ply-wood, others have a barrel stave construction. The drum shell is covered on both sides by goat skins which are pulled tightly with rope. Different amounts of \"massala\", a proprietary thick, sticky, tar-like concoction, is placed in the insides of the skin to create a lower frequency resonation on the \"bass\" side hit with a stick, and a higher frequency resonation on the more \"treble\" side hit with the hand. The deep, booming sounds of bass drums can be heard from long distances. The flair and machismo of a tassa group usually falls to the bass player, the playing style of which can range from stationary and reserved to flamboyant, aggressive and punishing, the latter of which has been termed \"break away\". When 2 or more groups compete, it is often the loudest bass drum(s) which can lead to victory.\n\nThe typical tassa group is as follows: the lead tassa player is called the \"cutter\" or \"cut-man\". The cutter plays the main, pulsating rhythm, or taal, or hand. The second tassa player is known as the \"fulley\" or \"fuller\", as their role is to make the rhythm or \"taal\" sound more full. The fulley plays a steady rhythm usually a simplified version of the main hand but in same metre and mode. The bass drummer adds power and depth to the taal with a constant, ground-shaking beat. The jhaanj man or brass man (sometimes played by a woman) plays the cymbals which enrich the overall sound of the ensemble with piercing or smooth metallic brass sounds creating by vibrating one cymbal against the other.\n\nThe rhythms (hands, taal) are quite complex and each have many variations. Some basic hands are tikora, wedding tikora, wedding hand, nagaara, chutney, dingolay, soca, chaubola. \"Classical\" hands include kalinda, khemta, bhajan, thumri, daadra. Hosay (Muharram) festival rhythms include saada mahaatam, chalta mahaatam, teen choppa, and nabi sarwar.\n\nThe tassa drums are played with sticks made from wild cane (called \"chob\", Hindi for cane sticks) or fiberglass. The sticks can either have very tightly wound masking tape at the top or the sap from a balata tree wound into a ball can form the head of a stick. When played, these pliant sticks are struck on the head of the drum and accomplish a unique sound because the flexibility of the stick is responsible for the roll rather than the regressive bouncing action of the head of the stick.\n\nMoon Rambahal, Shyam-Bulay Gita, Samlal, Hari Lutchman, Imaam Ali Mohammed, Soogrim Ram, Sylvan Bharat, Joe Boodoosingh, Hyder Ali, Dhanlali, Doon, Narine Rampersad, Ali Baksh, Datoor.\n\n"}

For example, in the Chinese pinyin alphabet, \"qi\" is pronounced (similar to \"chi\" in English) by an English speaker, as pinyin uses \"q\" to represent the sound , which is approximated as (ch) in English. In other examples, \"Q\" represents in standard Arabic, such as in \"qat\", \"faqir\" and \"Qur'ān\". In Arabic, the letter ق, traditionally romanised as \"Q\", is quite distinct from ك, traditionally romanised as \"K\"; for example, means \"heart\" but means \"dog\".

In June 1981, \"Heaven Up Here\" became Echo & the Bunnymen's first Top 10 release when it reached number 10 on the UK Albums Chart. It was also the band's first entry into the United States albums charts when it reached number 184 of the \"Billboard\" 200. \"Heaven Up Here\" released the singles \"A Promise\" and \"Over the Wall\".\n\nRecorded at Rockfield Studios near Monmouth in Wales, \"Heaven Up Here\" was co-produced by Hugh Jones and the band. A generally well received album by fans in the United Kingdom and by critics, \"Heaven Up Here\" won the \"Best Dressed LP\" and \"Best Album\" awards at the 1981 NME Awards. The album has also been listed at number 463 in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nAfter the public and press interest garnered from Echo & the Bunnymen's debut album, \"Crocodiles\", the band released the \"Shine So Hard\" EP which maintained their profile. Work then soon began on their second album, \"Heaven Up Here\". Following musical differences between the band and \"Crocodiles\" producers Bill Drummond and David Balfe, Hugh Jones was brought in to produce \"Heaven Up Here\". Jones had previously engineered \"Crocodiles\" and co-produced \"Shine So Hard\" with Drummond. Jones would later go on to produce the band's 2005 album \"Siberia\". The band were also given an additional producer credit. The album was recorded at Rockfield Studios near Monmouth in Wales during March 1981.\n\nIn the liner notes to the 2003 remastered version of the album, lead singer Ian McCulloch said that he constantly had the American rock band The Velvet Underground's song \"What Goes On\" in the back of his mind. He also stated that the band wanted to record a soul album. In the same liner notes, bassist Les Pattinson said that the band was often lazy and hence had hired rehearsal space at the Ministry in Liverpool. He said this made them work harder and develop \"language\" in the rhythm. According to guitarist Will Sergeant, McCulloch considers \"Heaven Up Here\" to be Sergeant's album because he was bossy and a control freak during the recording.\n\nIn 1981, music magazine the \"NME\" described the album as darker and more passionate than 1980's \"Crocodiles\". The \"Record Mirror\" also said that the band sang the blues and devoted themselves to existential sadness. They went on to note that the album offered \"an anatomy of melancholy, resplendent with the glamour of doom\". \"Melody Maker\" disagreed when in 1981 they said \"the Bunnymen are continuing to play majestic, uplifting music that will shine through the dark days ahead of us\". In the 2002 book \"Turquoise Days: The Weird World of Echo & the Bunnymen\", author Chris Adams said that in 1995 McCulloch had said, \"That spikey edge [of the album] still stands up.\" In relation to their style of music, in 1980 McCulloch had said, \"I always say 'We're a rock band'. Because I'm proud of that.\" He added, \"I like rock music [...] I prefer being good or great within that basic format [...] I just prefer basic songs.\"\n\nIn his 2005 book \"Rip It Up and Start Again: Post Punk 1978–1984\", British music journalist Simon Reynolds described the sound of \"Heaven Up Here\" as having been filled out with \"guitar overdubs, keyboard glints, vocal multitracking and atmospheric vapours\". Comparing \"Heaven Up Here\" with Joy Division's 1980 album \"Closer\", Reynolds said they are \"harrowed by the same things [...] hypocrisy, distrust, betrayal, lost or frozen potential\". However, he said that \"\"Closer\" shows Ian Curtis fatally mesmerized by his own dread visions, \"Heaven Up Here\" ultimately turns its face towards the light\" with the tracks \"No Dark Things\" – which he describes as renouncing \"death-wishful thinking\" – and \"All I Want\" – which he describes as \"a blasting celebration of desire for desire's sake\" and \"pure intransitive exhilaration\".\n\nThe photograph used on the front and back cover of the album was taken by photographer Brian Griffin. The picture shows the band on a wet beach in the south Wales seaside town of Porthcawl; there are dark clouds in the sky and the sun is low on the horizon causing the band to be silhouetted. The picture was taken on a day off from recording the album. The original album's cover art was designed by Martyn Atkins. According to Griffin, they used buckets of fish offal to entice the gulls to fly into shot. He also stated that both Drummond and Rob Dickins, head of their record label Korova, hated the pictures from the shoot, and that he and Atkins had to fight for them to be used on the sleeve. The cover received the \"Best Dressed LP\" award in the 1981 NME Awards. Reynolds said that the band's manager Drummond saw them as representing \"cold, dampness, darkness\".\n\nThe front cover picture of the original album was kept for the 2003 reissue. However, the design was altered slightly by graphic designer Rachel Gutek of the design company guppyart. The release contained an expanded booklet written by music journalist Max Bell giving the background to the album. The booklet also contains a number of photographs which are credited to Sergeant and Pattinson.\n\nThe album was originally released as an LP by Korova in the United Kingdom on 30 May 1981. It was then released in the United States by Sire Records on 24 June 1981. It was released elsewhere on Korova although with a different catalogue number. Side one of the LP contained five tracks and side two had six. The album was first released on CD on 16 May 1988.\n\nAlong with their first five albums, the album was remastered and reissued on CD in 2003 containing five bonus tracks – these releases were marketed as 25th anniversary editions. \"Broke My Neck (Long Version)\", which was recorded at Tistedal Studios in Norway on 7 June 1981, is the B-side of the 12-inch single \"A Promise\" – an edited version was used as the B-side of the 7-inch single. The other four bonus tracks were recorded live at the Manly Vale Hotel in Sydney, Australia on 11 November 1981. The reissued album was produced by music historian Andy Zax and producer Bill Inglot.\n\nThe only single from \"Heaven Up Here\" released worldwide was \"A Promise\" on 10 July 1981. The single stayed on the UK Singles Chart for four weeks and reached number 49. Later that year, \"Over the Wall\" was released as a single in Australia only.\n\n\"Heaven Up Here\" was generally well received by the music press and critics. In a 1982 interview with the band for the \"NME\", rock journalist Barney Hoskins described the album as \"one of the most superior articulations of 'rock' form in living memory.\" Later reviews have continued to receive the album well: Allmusic reviewer Aaron Warshaw said that McCulloch \"sings with soaring abandon and passion throughout the album\" and that Sergeant's guitar playing was at its \"angular finest\". Not all reviews were positive: Robert Christgau, giving the album a C rating, said that he held \"no brief against tuneless caterwaul, but tuneless psychedelic caterwaul has always been another matter.\" In his 1999 book \"From the Shores of Lake Placid and Other Stories\", the band's manager Bill Drummond said \"The album is dull as ditchwater. The songs are unformed, the sound uniformly grey.\"\n\n\"Heaven Up Here\" sold well in the United Kingdom, staying on the UK Albums Chart for a total of 16 weeks and reaching a peak of number 10 in June 1981. The album was the first release by Echo & the Bunnymen to make it onto the American charts when it reached number 184 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\n\nIn 2012, the album ranked number 463 on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The \"NME\" has ranked the album number 39 in its list of the 50 greatest albums of the '80s and number 51 in its list of the greatest albums of all time. The album also received the \"NME\"'s 1981 best album award. Reynolds described the award as \"essentially an anti-New Pop protest vote by post-punk's silent majority\".\n\nAll tracks written by Will Sergeant, Ian McCulloch, Les Pattinson and Pete de Freitas.\n\n\n\n\nwith:\n\n"}

He was educated at St. Aloysius' College, Glasgow, Mount St Mary's College near Sheffield, and the University of Glasgow. He was admitted as an advocate in 1932. \n\nHe served in the Royal Artillery and the Judge Advocate Generals' Branch during World War II. As an advocate, he appeared before the Court of Session in his military uniform. As a young man he played football for Shettleston F.C.\n\nHe was an unsuccessful parliamentary candidate for Bute and North Ayrshire in 1945 and for Glasgow Bridgeton in 1946, where he was defeated by the Independent Labour Party candidate. He was elected for Edinburgh East at a by-election in November 1947 and sat for the constituency until 1954. During his time in the Commons, he never made a Maiden Speech.\n\nHe was Solicitor General for Scotland from March to October 1947, when he was appointed Lord Advocate. He was appointed a King's Counsel (KC) and a Privy Counsellor (PC) in 1947. One of his most significant achievements as a politician was the establishment of the legal aid scheme in Scotland. He was appointed to the bench, with the judicial title \"Lord Wheatley\". In 1966 he was appointed chairman of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Scotland.\n\nThe resulting \"Wheatley Report\", published in 1969, led to the eventual introduction a new system of Scottish local authorities. On 28 July 1970 he was created a life peer, as Baron Wheatley, of Shettleston in the County of the City of Glasgow. In December 1972 he was appointed to succeed Lord Grant as Lord Justice Clerk,\na post he held until 1985.\n\nFollowing the Ibrox disaster in 1971, Wheatley was appointed by the government to conduct an inquiry into safety at sports grounds. His 1972 report became the basis for the \"Green Guide\".\n\nWheatley was a lifelong Roman Catholic. He was also known for hard sentencing of crimes involving sex. While Lord Justice-Clerk (an appeal judge), he exercised his right to sit as a trial judge in criminal cases, and handed out long sentences for such crimes.\n\nIt was Wheatley's memorial service in 1988 which was attended by his old friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern, at the time Lord Chancellor. As a member of the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland, which strongly disapproves of Roman Catholicism, Mackay was disciplined by his church for having attended the memorial service.\n\nHis uncle was the Shettleston MP John Wheatley.\n\nWheatley's son-in-law was the late Tam Dalyell, former father of the House of Commons, who married Wheatley's daughter, Kathleen, in 1963.\n"}

He undertook doctoral work in American religious history at the University of Chicago, defending with distinction a Ph.D. dissertation about the Revolutionary era in 1982. \n\nCorrigan subsequently held academic posts at the University of Virginia, Harvard University, Arizona State University, Oxford University, University of London, University of Halle-Wittenberg, Columbia University, and University College (Dublin), and as a visiting scholar at the American Academy in Rome, Research Associate at the American Antiquarian Society, and the Fulbright Distinguished Research Chair for the Netherlands. He joined the religion and history departments at Florida State University in 2001, where he also was the founding director of the Institute for the Study of Emotion. \n\nCorrigan was coeditor of the journal \"Church History: Studies in Christianity and Culture\" (Cambridge University Press) from 2003-2016. He is editor of the \"Chicago History of American Religion\", a book series published by the University of Chicago Press, and co-editor of \"The Spatial Humanities\", a book series published by Indiana University Press.\n\nCorrigan's contributions to scholarship are in three overlapping areas: American religious history, religion and emotion, and the spatial humanities.\n\nCorrigan has written books that collectively address the sweep of American religious history from the colonial period to the present. Those books take emotion to be a central part of religious life and analyze it historically. \"The Hidden Balance\" (1987) argued that certain key eighteenth-century American religious thinkers and social theorists understood thinking and feeling to be conjoined in religious life just as they were in social and political life. \"The Prism of Piety\" (1991) proposed that understandings of emotion as a physical experience were central to the religious lives of colonial New Englanders. In \"Business of the Heart\" (2002) Corrigan evidenced the way in which emotion was imagined as a commodity in the nineteenth century, exchanged between individuals according to feeling rules, and conceptualized as both affective capital and a medium of trade between persons and a Protestant God. \"Emptiness: Feeling Christian in America\" (2015) tracked the deliberate Christian cultivation of the feeling of emptiness throughout American history and the social divisions related to that. The topic of emotion is prominent in his textbook \"Religion in America.\"\nCorrigan's study of emotion led him to the specific feeling of hatred. His books on religious intolerance directly address the problem of religious hatred and how historically it has issued in violence. \"Religious Intolerance in America\" (co-authored with Lynn Neal, 2010), and \"Religious Intolerance, America, and the World\" (2020) analyze the history of religious intolerance in America, sometimes with an eye to broader global developments, and in relation to feeling as a central aspect of religiously-inspired violence. \"The Emotional Practice of Religious Intolerance\" (2020) draws upon emotions theory to illustrate how intolerance develops historically. \n\nCorrigan has claimed that the historical and critical study of emotion is crucial to the advancement of the academic field of religious studies. He contends that a residual parochialism in the field, which equated something thought to be mysterious about religion with something thought to be equally mysterious about emotion, framed emotion as an irreducible datum and discouraged analytical and scientific approaches to its study. His approach combines the history of emotions with insights drawn from philosophy, anthropology, psychology, and brain science. He has advised that scholars must take care to avoid creating a highly specialized and technical \"secret language\" to talk about emotion if progress is to be made investigating it alongside religion. He has maintained that the most promising approach is through interdisciplinary collaborations. \"Religion and Emotion: Approaches and Interpretations\" (2004), \"The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Emotion\" (2006), and \"Feeling Religion\" (2018) are efforts to bring a wide field of disciplinary perspectives and voices to the study of religion and emotion.\n\nThe term \"spatial humanities,\" which has been globally adopted, was coined by Corrigan, David Bodenhamer, and Trevor Harris at an expert workshop at the Polis Center in 2008. It identifies a collaboration between humanities scholars and other researchers, and especially the ways in which scholarship that exploits digitally-enabled representations of space (through GIS and media software) can help to bridge the epistemological divide between the humanities and the sciences. Corrigan and others have proposed that the \"deep map,\" a detailed, multilayered, fluid, and polyvocal representation of space that blends quantitative and qualitative data, is a promising tool for the study of culture. That idea, outlined in \"Deep Maps\" (2015), informs parts of the multi-volume \"Oxford Encyclopedia of Religion in America\" (2018), one-fifth of which is dedicated to the topic of religion and space.\n\nCorrigan's focus on religion, emotion, space, and power amounts to what the \"London Times Literary Supplement\" characterized as an effort to demonstrate how religion seeks to \"mediate a comprehensive map of the world.\" It is a history that offers \"a complex account of group identity and boundary-making.\" While Corrigan has \"explicitly brought emotions and religion under the analytical microscope,\" and for that has been called \"our doyen of the study of religion and emotion,\" his research has been criticized as more history of emotions than history of religion and for overestimating forms of social control, including the power of emotional scripts.\n\nCorrigan has been awarded fellowships for professors from the National Endowment for the Humanities, National Humanities Center, Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, American Council of Learned Societies, and the Fulbright program. In 2017 he was designated Alumnus of the Year of the University of Chicago Divinity School. In 2016 he was named the Director of the Jessie Ball du Pont Faculty Seminar at the National Humanities Center. \n\n\"The Hidden Balance: Religion and the Social Theories of Charles Chauncy and Jonathan Mayhew\" (Cambridge University Press, 1987; paperback, 2006)\n\n\"The Prism of Piety: Catholick Congregationalist Clergy at the Beginning of the Enlightenment\" (Oxford University Press, 1991)\n\n\"Religion in America: An Historical Account of the Development of American Religious Life,\" 5th (revised) ed., co-author with Winthrop Hudson, (Macmillan, 1992)\n\n\"Jews, Christians, Muslims: A Comparative Introduction to Monotheistic Religions,\" general editor and co-author with Carlos M.

{"id": "2233546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233546", "title": "OCB mode", "text": "OCB mode\n\nOCB mode (Offset Codebook Mode) is an authenticated encryption mode of operation for cryptographic block ciphers. OCB mode was designed by Phillip Rogaway, who credits Mihir Bellare, John Black, and Ted Krovetz with assistance and comments on the designs. It is based on the authenticated encryption mode IAPM due to Charanjit S. Jutla. Its version \"OCB2\" has proven insecure, while the original \"OCB1\" as well as \"OCB3\" from 2011 are still considered secure.\n\nOCB mode was designed to provide both message authentication and privacy. It is essentially a scheme for integrating a Message Authentication Code (MAC) into the operation of a block cipher. In this way, OCB mode avoids the need to use two systems: a MAC for authentication and encryption for privacy. This results in lower computational cost compared to using separate encryption and authentication functions.\n\nThere are three versions of OCB: OCB1, OCB2 and OCB3. OCB1 was published in 2001. OCB2 improves on OCB1 by allowing associated data to be included with the message (providing AEAD) — that is, data that are not encrypted but should be authenticated — and a new method for generating a sequence of offsets. OCB2 was first published in 2003, originally named AEM (Authenticated-Encryption Mode, or Advanced Encryption Mode) and was shown to be completely insecure in 2019 (see § Attacks below). OCB3, published in 2011, changes again the way offsets are computed and introduces minor performance improvements.\n\nOCB mode is listed as an optional method in the IEEE 802.11 wireless security standard as an alternative to CCM. OCB2 is standardized in ISO/IEC 19772:2009 and a modified OCB3 in RFC 7253. The RFC encodes the tag length into the internally formatted nonce.\n\nOCB performance overhead is minimal compared to classical, non-authenticating modes like CBC. OCB requires one block cipher operation per block of encrypted and authenticated message, and one block cipher operation per block of associated data. There is also one extra block cipher operation required at the end of process.\n\nFor comparison, CCM mode offering similar functionality requires twice as many block cipher operations per message block (associated data requires one, as in OCB).\n\nTwo U.S. patents have been issued for OCB mode. However, a special exemption is granted allowing OCB mode to be used in software licensed under the GNU General Public License without cost, as well as for any non-commercial, non-governmental application. This constraint has hindered approval by the US Federal Govt (NIST).\n\nSince the authors have only applied for patent protection in the U.S., the algorithm is free to use in software not developed and not sold inside the U.S.\n\nBy January 2013, the author has granted a free license for any open source license certified by the Open Source Initiative.\n\nNiels Ferguson pointed out collision attacks on OCB, which limits the amount of data that can be securely processed under a single key to about 280 terabytes.\n\nIn October 2018, Inoue and Minematsu presented an existential forgery attack against OCB2 that requires only a single prior encryption query and almost no computational power or storage. The attack does not extend to OCB1 or OCB3, and it requires that the associated data field of the forged ciphertext be empty. Poettering and Iwata improved the forgery attack to a full plaintext recovery attack just a couple of days later. The four authors later produced a joint report.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2233562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233562", "title": "Continental Airlines Flight 1713", "text": "Continental Airlines Flight 1713\n\nContinental Airlines Flight 1713 was a commercial airline flight that crashed while taking off in a snowstorm from Stapleton International Airport in Denver, Colorado on The Douglas DC-9 was operated by Continental Airlines and was a scheduled flight to Boise, Idaho. Twenty-five passengers and three crew members died in the crash.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation of the accident determined the most probable cause of the accident was the pilot in command's failure to have the aircraft deiced a second time before take off. \n\nFlight 1713 was operated using a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-14, a twin-engine, narrow-body jet airliner with the registration number \"N626TX.\" The aircraft was equipped with two Pratt & Whitney JT8D-7B engines. It was originally delivered to Air Canada in 1966, and sold to Continental in 1982. In 21 years of service, it had accumulated over 52,400 flight hours and over 61,800 cycles.\n\nThe captain was 43-year-old Frank B. Zvonek Jr., who had been working with Continental Airlines since 1969. He had 12,125 hours of flight experience, but only 166 hours on the DC-9. He had been upgraded to captain less than three weeks earlier.\n\nThe first officer was 26-year-old Lee Edward Bruecher, hired by Continental four months earlier; he had previously flown for Rio Airways, and passed his initial proficiency check in the DC-9 in mid-September. He had 3,186 flight hours, but only 36 hours on the DC-9, the extent of his turbojet experience, and had not flown for 24 days. Bruecher was the pilot flying at the time of the accident.\n\nThe cabin crew consisted of three flight attendants.\n\nAt the time of the accident on Sunday afternoon, the National Weather Service was reporting moderate wet snow at Stapleton International Airport. The heaviest snowfall rate occurred between 13:10 and 14:20 MST, with peak snowfall rate occurring around 13:50.\n\nContinental Airlines Flight 1713 was scheduled to depart Denver at 12:25, but many flights out of Denver that day were delayed by inclement weather. At 13:03, Flight 1713 taxied from its gate to the de-icing pad; air traffic controllers were not aware that Flight 1713 had departed the gate because the flight crew did so without requesting taxi clearance. De-icing was completed at 13:46.\n\nAt 13:51, Flight 1713 contacted the clearance delivery controller for permission to \"taxi from the ice pad.\" The clearance delivery controller, believing that Flight 1713 was still at the gate and requesting to proceed to de-icing, instructed the flight to switch to ground controller frequency.\n\nAt 14:05, Flight 1713 was lined up on the number one position at the north end of the runway, and the crew was ready for take off. Not kept properly informed of Flight 1713’s position, the air traffic controllers tried repeatedly to have a different plane takeoff, leaving Flight 1713 standing in the falling snow for several minutes. Flight 1713 then notified air traffic controllers that they were holding at the start of the runway and awaiting takeoff instructions.\nFlight 1713 was cleared for takeoff at 14:14. As the DC-9 was taking off, the pilot in control over-rotated; the DC-9 descended and the left wing struck the ground, causing the wing to separate. A fuel-fed flash fire ignited in the left wing shortly after it struck the ground, causing a \"fireball\" inside the cabin. The left side of the DC-9 and cockpit struck the ground next and the DC-9 continued rolling, inverted. As the DC-9 skidded, the left side was tilted over and the tail was inverted; this action caused the middle part of the DC-9 to compress and crush many of the passengers on board.\n\nA total of 25 passengers and 3 crew members died due to the crash; the final two fatalities succumbed while hospitalized. The captain and first officer, one flight attendant, and 11 passengers died from blunt trauma. In addition, 5 passengers died of head injuries secondary to blunt trauma, and 9 passengers died of asphyxia. The remaining 52 passengers and 2 flight attendants survived. Of the surviving passengers, 25 received minor injuries and 27 received serious injuries. Fitzsimons Army Medical Center sent its personnel to assist in the triage of passengers, and ten hospitals treated the survivors.\n\nThe NTSB investigated the accident.\n\nIn July 1988, Continental Airlines filed a report with the NTSB positing the causes of the crash as wake turbulence, poor snow plowing on the runway and errors by air traffic controllers. However, the NTSB investigated the wake-turbulence theory and concluded that wake turbulence from the preceding flight would not have affected Flight 1713.\n\nDuring the investigation, the crew's little experience on the DC-9 was brought into question. Investigators also discovered that prior to being hired by Continental, Bruecher had been dismissed by another airline after failing on three occasions to pass a flight exam. Investigators likewise determined that first officer Bruecher was at the controls at the time of the accident.\n\nInvestigators determined that 27 minutes elapsed between the conclusion of de-icing and Flight 1713's attempt to take off, seven minutes longer than should have been allowed to elapse before takeoff. The NTSB concluded that the wing surface became contaminated by a build-up of ice on the wings of Flight 1713 prior to departure, based on reports from surviving passengers that they had seen \"patches\" of ice on the wing after deicing was complete. Investigators also concluded that enough wet snow landed on Flight 1713 after deicing was complete to melt and dilute the deicing fluid, which allowed ice to reform on the wings. According to the aircraft's manufacturer, even a modest amount of ice contamination on the upper wing could impair the lifting performance of the wings and lead to loss of roll and pitch control. Based on this, the NTSB concluded that a small amount of ice on the wings had caused Flight 1713 to have significant controllability problems.\n\nThe NTSB also determined that the first officer's poor performance during takeoff had likely contributed to his loss of control of the airplane. The first officer rotated the airplane at more than 6 degrees per second, or twice the recommended rate. Combined with the effects of ice on the wing, the high climb rate caused the plane's left wing to stall and the plane to begin rolling over. Flight 1713 was Bruecher's first flight after a 24-day absence from flight duties, and the NTSB concluded that this prolonged absence had eroded the newly hired first officer's retention of his recent training, which contributed to his poor takeoff performance.\n\nOn September 27, 1988, the NTSB published a final report on its investigation into the crash, attributing the accident to the captain's failure to have the plane de-iced a second time, the first officer's poor takeoff performance, confusion between the pilots and air traffic controllers which contributed to delays, compounded by a cockpit crew where both pilots were relatively inexperienced on the aircraft type. Specifically, the NTSB concluded:\nAfter the crash, Continental Airlines reiterated its procedures for handling deicing and developed a computerized assignment program that would keep pilots with less than 100 hours flying time in type from being assigned to the same flight. \n\nNine months after the crash of Flight 1713, Delta Air Lines Flight 1141 crashed in Dallas. When the NTSB released its report on Flight 1713, it specifically mentioned the fact that \"almost 3 minutes of nonpertinent social conversation\" had occurred before take-off. When the NTSB later issued its report on Delta 1141, it found that the Delta crew had also engaged in nonpertinent conversation, including a discussion of the cockpit voice recorder from the crash of Continental 1713. The report on Delta 1141 concluded, amongst other causes, that the Dallas crash was caused by that crews’ nonpertinent conversation contributing to their failure to extend that aircraft's flaps and slats to proper take-off configuration.\n\nStapleton was replaced by Denver International Airport in 1995; it has since been decommissioned and the property redeveloped as a retail and residential neighborhood. Continental merged with UAL Corporation (the parent company of United Airlines) via a stock swap in 2010, and the integration was completed in 2012. \n\nContinental Airlines Flight 1713 was mentioned in the 1988 film \"Rain Man\".\n\nThe crash was the subject of episode 10, season 18 of \"Mayday\", \"Dead of Winter\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2233613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233613", "title": "Chi Phi", "text": "Chi Phi\n\nChi Phi (ΧΦ) is the oldest American men's college social fraternity that was established as the result of the merger of three separate organizations that were each known as Chi Phi. The earliest of these organizations was formed at Princeton University in 1824. Today, Chi Phi has over 47,000 living alumni members from over 100 active and inactive chapters and un-chartered colonies. Currently Chi Phi has about 50 active Chapters and 5 Colonies.\n\nOn Christmas Eve in 1824, an association was formed to promote the circulation of correct opinions upon Religion, Morals, Education & excluding Sectarian Theology and party Politics. It was the duty of each member to publish at least once a month in any convenient way some article designed to answer the above object. When at length it disbanded, its religious feature was absorbed and perpetuated by what is known now as the 'Philadelphian Society' organized in February, 1825, and said to be an offspring of the Nassau Hall Tract Society. The old Chi Phi constitution was discovered in 1854 by some undergraduates who emphasizing the social and disregarding the religious purpose reorganized the society into the modern Greek letter fraternity of the same initials. The majority of the religious societies founded in Princeton were less general in their scope but more efficient in their work than the old Chi Phi.\n\n\nRecords of the original Chi Phi Society were discovered in 1854 by John Maclean, Jr. of the class of 1858. Maclean found the records in his uncle's (also named John Maclean, Jr.) paperwork, who happened to be president of the college at that time. Maclean joined with students Charles Smith DeGraw and Gustavus W. Mayer to form a new Chi Phi Fraternity that was based on some records of the original society but also with many characteristics that differed from the original society. While the Chi Phi Fraternity of today was actually founded in 1854, the members place great emphasis on the 1824 date because of many aspects that were carried over from the original records discovered in 1854. The names of the founders of the original society of 1824 were not even known to the 1854 founders; however, they were later discovered and published in the book \"Princeton\" by V.L. Collins in 1914. The Chi Phi Fraternity founded by Maclean was also short-lived. The group existed sub rosa only until 1859 when it was abandoned completely. However, before the Princeton chapter died off, it was able to successfully establish a second chapter at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 1854. The chapter at Franklin and Marshall in turn planted a chapter at Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe second Chi Phi Fraternity was founded at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on August 21, 1858 by five undergraduate students. The Chi Phi Fraternity of the South was also the second exclusively southern Fraternity established prior to the Civil War and was very successful in planting six chapters prior to the outbreak of hostilities and nine afterwards, but prior to the merger with the Northern Order. All but the UNC chapter suspended operations as a result of the Civil War.\n\n\nOn November 14, 1860, the third independent fraternity to be named Chi Phi was founded at Hobart College, Geneva by twelve men who took the initiatory oath and received a badge. The twelve men later became known throughout Chi Phi as the \"Twelve Apostles\". The fraternity was officially known as the \"Secret Order of Chi Phi\" and the first chapter would be called the Upsilon chapter. The Secret Order of Chi Phi at Hobart planted four additional chapters, and then in 1865, negotiations began regarding a merger with the Princeton Order. Negotiations were completed on May 29, 1867, and chapters from both groups united as the Northern Order.\n\n\nFollowing the end of the Civil War, on March 27, 1874, the North and South orders officially formed a united organization known as the Chi Phi Fraternity. At the meeting, three members from each order adopted a constitution and by-laws and established a date for the first convention, which was held in Washington, DC on July 23, 1874.\n\nIn June 1867, due to the disruption of the American Civil War, a group of Southern students led by Peter Mitchell Wilson, A-A '69 and other students from the States of Louisiana and South Carolina, chartered the Theta Chapter of the Southern Order at the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland. This Chapter is thought to be the first international and only European Chapter of an American College Fraternity.\n\nExcept for a brief period in 1911, three Chi Phis (Joseph Mackey Brown, John Marshall Slaton and Nathaniel E. Harris) held the office of governor in the State of Georgia from 1909 to 1917. Brown was vehemently opposed to Slaton's pardon of Leo Frank in 1915 and since his death in 1932, Brown has been implicated as a conspirator in Frank's lynching.\n\nChi Phi's conservative expansion philosophy that only the old, well established schools were suitable for a Chapter led to the denial of a petition for a charter by a group of students at the University of Richmond in 1901. This group went on to found the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. During the subsequent fifty-three year period, Sigma Phi Epsilon chartered over 140 Chapters, while Chi Phi only chartered 14.\n\nA man named Jerry Reid, who returned to college in a new major at the age of 68 and subsequently pledged Chi Phi, is possibly the oldest new member ever thus far to join a college fraternity.\n\n\n"}

Their self designation is \"Шор\", or \"Shor\". They were also called Kuznetskie Tatars (кузнецкие татары), Kondoma Tatars (кондомские татары), Mras-Su Tatars (мрасские татары) in some of the documents of the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nMost Shors live in the Tom basin along the Kondoma and Mras-Su Rivers. This region is historically called Mountainous Shoria. The Shors also live in Khakassia and Altai Republic. According to 2002 census, there were 13,975 Shors in Russia (12,601 in 1926, 16,042 in 1939, 14,938 in 1959, 15,950 in 1970, 15,182 in 1979 and 15,745 in 1989). The Shors speak their own Shor language.\n\nThe Shors as a people formed as a result of a long process of intermixing between the Turkic, Ugrian, Samoyedic and Ket-speaking tribes. Their culture and origins are similar to those of the northern Altay people and some of the ethnic groups of the Khakas. The region where the Shors currently reside was Turkicized under the influence of the Yenisei Kirghiz during the medieval period. The Shors resulted from this ethnic mixing and adopted Turkic speech (the Shor language) as a result. Shor tribes began to become a distinct people around the 8th and 9th centuries CE. The Mongol conquest of the Altai-Sayan region in the 13th century added another layer of cultural influence over the local population and their languages. The region subsequently fell under the influence of the Oirats from the late 14th century to the early 17th century. Although Mongol control of the area was nominal, many of the languages (including Shor) contains significant amounts of Mongol loanwords. The Shors were a valuable asset to the Yenisei Kirghiz and Oirats as suppliers of ironware. Their ability to smelt iron from ore was a feat that only one other indigenous Siberian people (the Yakuts) were able to do before the Russian advance to the area.\n\nIn the early 17th century, the Shors and their territory were conquered by the Russians. In the 18th century, Russian settlers began to move in to the area. The Shors' niche as producers of ironware for the Oirats, Altaians, and Kirghiz was soon eroded by the Russian traders. The Russians had more advanced products to offer and this ended Shor blacksmithing. Atop of this, Russian officials subjected the Shors to pay \"yasak\" in the form of furs. This resulted in most Shors abandoning their old occupations and villages to move to nearby towns so they can make a better living as hunters. However, they lived in squalid conditions. The use of nettle-fibre or wild hemp for clothing, primitive implements, and techniques continued on towards the 20th century.\n\nThe Shors were little affected by the Russian Revolution and its civil war until the Bolsheviks took the region in 1920. In 1929, the Shor National Region was formed but was quickly dissolved in 1939. The okrug (district) was disbanded because the Soviet authorities believed its existence might hinder the development of the iron and coal industries in the region. These minerals became important to the state after deposits were discovered in the Kuznetsk Basin in the 1930s. This discovery led to a new wave of Russian settlers and workers to the region and began displacing the Shors. The authorities considered the Shors to be numerically insignificant and that disenfranchising them would not be consequential to the state. The Shors greatly suffered as a result. They were driven out of their farms and villages and forced to work in the coal mines. The population of the Shors declined and the urban Shors struggled with alcoholism, drug addiction, suicide, and high lethal accident rates. Traditional Shor culture began to wane . The liberalization of Soviet rule beginning in the 1980s led to a Shor cultural revival and the establishment of many cultural and linguistic institutions (like the creation of The Association of Shor People in the 1990s). The current situation of the Shors is not free of issues however. Many Shors do not know their native language and show indifference to their traditional culture. Illness, discrimination, environmental racism, high death rates but low birth rates, drug and alcohol addiction, and the possibility of the Shors being swallowed up by the dominant Russian culture in the near future are other issues the modern Shors face.\n\nThe Shors were originally practitioners of shamanism and animism but were converted to Russian Orthodox Christianity during Russian rule since the early 17th century. Conversions occurred rapidly after the establishment of the Altai Spiritual Mission in the 1830s. Most present Shors are Russian Orthodox Christians.\n\nDespite the conversion of Christianity among the Shors, shamanism has had and still is very important and influential to modern Shor spirituality. Shor Shamanism and its \"kam\" (shamans) have suffered persecution since Russian colonization of the region especially from the 17th to 20th centuries. The establishment of the Altai Spiritual Mission in the region resulted in the severe persecution of shamanism and the kam. Christian missionaries routinely lambasted Shor shamanism as being a dark cult and the kam as servants of the devil. There was many forced conversions to Christianity as well. During the soviet era, the authorities frequently designated the kam and others as enemies of the state and sentenced them to camps or even death. Graves, drums, ritual clothing, and more were burned or desecrated during this period. Shor shamanism saw a revival starting in the late 1980s and is considered a vital part of modern Shor identity.\n\nThe Shors were mainly engaged in hunting, fishing, some primitive farming, and pine nut picking. Blacksmithing and iron ore mining and melting were also important (hence, the name \"Blacksmithing Tatars\"). The lifestyle of the Shors changed significantly following the October Revolution of 1917. Most became skillful farmers, cattle-breeders, or industrial workers.\n\nThe Shors were able to retain much of their ancient clan structure over the years. Each clan was traditionally led by a chief. Chiefs were elected in large clan gatherings. These gatherings was where important decisions, conflicts, and other issues were settled. Features of their society included matrilocal marriages, exogamy, a classisfactory system of kinship terms, and the belief in certain taboos that revolve around the former. Clans routinely organized communal hunts and shared the spoils equally among themselves. However, this clan system eroded beginning in the mid-nineteenth century under the Russian influence of separating families into individual units. A family now relied on a money economy and this soon resulted in wealth disparity and differentiation in Shor society.\n\nEnvironmental activist Alexander Arbachakov won a Whitley Award for his work preserving sustainable communities in Shor territory. The coal, iron, gold, and timber resources of the region are extracted by companies that show little regard to the Shors and the environment of the area. The Shors receive no direct financial benefits for the extraction of these minerals on their land. This has made some Shor feel attacked as minerals are often taken from places the Shors consider sacred.\n\nThroat-singing is an ancient and traditional form of music in Shor culture. Epic stories about heroes and deities are popular and often accompanied by singing and the use of a kai-komus (two-stringed wooden instrument).\n\nThe first educational institution for the Shors was a missionary school that were established in the village of Kuzedevo around 1860. After 1867, the most talented graduates had the chance to continue their education at the College of Catechism in Kazan. However, the literacy rates of the Shors remained very low. The Soviets opened up ten schools and a children's home in 1921–22 in the village of Kabyrza. Within ten years, the number of schools in the region increased. Libraries and clubs were opened to abolish illiteracy. By 1932, a college to train teachers had 300 students and 70 of them were natives. By 1936, 114 schools (100 primary and 14 secondary) existed in the area. The use of Shor in the 1920s and the rising educational standards of the Shors led to an intellectual growth of the people. Scientists, teachers, doctors, writers, journalists, and clerks were represented within the Shors. Shor intellectual culture began to decline after the dissolution of the Shor National Region in 1939 and the removal of Shor as a language of instruction in schools in 1943. The teacher's college was closed while Shor intellectuals were repressed or killed fighting in the Great Patriotic War. The post-war period proved stagnant for Shor intellectual culture. The resurgence of the Shor identity beginning in the 1980s has led to a recent revival for traditional Shor culture and the establishment of new educational programs for native teachers, students, and the younger generation.\n\nThe universe was originally empty until the god Ul'gen created the three skies. He placed his son Paktan in the lowest sky. He then placed a spirit called Keikush in the middle sky while he and his wife Chaasin lived in the upper sky. Ul'gen's younger brother, Erlik, decided to create things himself. Erlik created the mountains, birds, and other animals. Meanwhile, Ul'gen created man but didn't know to make human souls and as a result the man he created was nothing more than a lifeless husk. He then set out on a journey in search of a soul and left a hairless dog to protect man in his absence. Erlik saw his chance and made his way to the man. The dog refused to let him pass but Erlik made a deal with the dog. If the dog lets him pass, he'll give him fur. Erlik passed and the dog's body grew fur. Erlik proceeded towards the lifeless man, spat on him, rubbed dirt on him, and left.\n\nUl'gen returned with his aim failed and saw the condition of the man and dog. The dog revealed what happened and Ul'gen wondered whether Erlik knew how to create souls. He summoned Erlik and he replied that he knew how to create souls. With no other options, Ul'gen agreed that Erlik would create the soul of man if he can have their souls. However, the body of man would belong to Ul'gen. Erlik used a tube made out of a hollow angelica stem and placed the tube in man's mouth. Erlik blew the soul through the tube and into man's body. Ul'gen soon wanted to banish Erlik from Earth but Erlik pleaded to Ul'gen to give him a corner of land for him to live in. Ul'gen raised his staff and a hole opened up where it was resting. Snakes, insects, and other creatures crawled out onto the Earth and Erlik climbed down the hole to the underworld.\n\nThe Shors traditionally believed that the universe was divided into three levels which were:\n\n\nAll these realms were said to be populated by spirits, humans, animals, and other creatures. The three worlds were linked via the axis of the World Tree or Mountain. The top of the World Tree housed the Heavenly Realm whilst its trunk passed through the Middle Earth and its roots reached down to the Underworld. The World Mountain was divided similarly with its peak connected to the Upper World and the foot of the mountain to the Earth.\n\nThe Heavenly realm is further divided into nine \"skies\". By ascending order these include:\n\n\nTraditional Shor religion is rich with deities and spirits. Some of the most revered or feared include:\n\n\nOther popular deities the Shors recognized (along with other Turkic peoples) included:\n\n\nFlag of the Shor people \n\n"}

{"id": "2233628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233628", "title": "2006 New Brunswick general election", "text": "2006 New Brunswick general election\n\nThe 2006 New Brunswick general election was held on September 18, 2006, to elect 55 members to the 56th New Brunswick Legislative Assembly, the governing house of the province of New Brunswick, Canada.\n\nThe campaign came earlier than expected: the incumbent Premier of New Brunswick, Bernard Lord, had pledged a vote would be held on October 15, 2007 but when the ruling Progressive Conservatives faced a loss of its majority in the legislature, Lord said he did not want to face a minority government and, moreover, feared that a by-election could tip the balance of power to the opposition Liberals.\n\nThe campaign was hard-fought with pundits and pollsters calling it too close to call throughout the five-week campaign. In the end, it was won by the Liberals led by Shawn Graham. The Liberals won 29 seats to 26 for the Progressive Conservatives, although the Progressive Conservatives won a plurality of the popular vote (47.5% to 47.2%).\n\nUnusually, the Liberals won 17 of the 36 predominantly anglophone ridings, their best showing in a competitive election in English New Brunswick since the 1944 election. The Conservatives conversely did better than they have ever done while losing an election among Francophone ridings.\n\nFollowing the report of the Commission on Legislative Democracy in December 2004, which recommended fixed election dates beginning on October 15, 2007, Premier Bernard Lord pledged to introduce legislation fixing election dates, beginning on that date. Due to this, and because it is tradition in New Brunswick to hold elections every four years, the Progressive Conservative government and media had routinely referred to this as the \"2007 election\" through early 2006. The opposition Liberals however always pledged to try to force an early election.\n\nFrom February through May 2006, it seemed possible that the Liberals might be successful in their goal as on February 17, 2006 Michael Malley left the Progressive Conservative caucus creating a minority government situation, Malley later became Speaker and, as Speaker, controversially rejoined the government caucus. The situation remained difficult for some time as the Liberals gained control of several key committees upon Malley's defection and would not return control to the government as they did not recognize Malley's change of affiliation while speaker. On May 30, 2006, the House reaffirmed its confidence in Malley in a vote and on May 31, 2006 the government and opposition announced a truce to allow the House to function more easily including a legislative calendar through 2007. As a result, it seemed unlikely that the government would fall prior to its chosen date to go to the polls.\n\nHowever, Peter Mesheau, a Progressive Conservative MLA who had already announced that he would not run for re-election, said he would have to resign his seat as he had accepted a job in the private sector. Lord said that he would not face another hung parliament and announced on August 10, 2006 that he would seek an election date of September 18. On August 18, Lord asked Lieutenant-Governor Herménégilde Chiasson to dissolve the legislature and set the election date.\n\nThe emerging key issues of the campaign seem to be leadership and energy prices. The Progressive Conservatives have for some years questioned the leadership abilities of Shawn Graham, the leader of the opposition while the Liberals have been focusing on energy in general as a theme for some time. Moreover, energy has come to the forefront due to the introduction of gas price regulation by Lord's government on July 1, 2006, and the Liberals announced their energy platform prior to the beginning of the campaign.\n\nThis election was the first campaign since the 1987 election in which Elizabeth Weir did not lead the smaller social democratic New Democratic Party (NDP). In 2005, Weir stepped down after seventeen years as NDP leader. She was succeeded by Fredericton-based social activist Allison Brewer, who stood for election in the riding of Fredericton-Lincoln.\n\nThe Progressive Conservative party were again be led by Bernard Lord and the Liberal Party by Shawn Graham.\n\nThe campaign was derided by journalists and political scientists as boring in part because much of the campaign was before Labour Day when many families were still taking summer holidays and also because the overall aspects of the two main parties were similar.\n\nThere were three English language debates and two French languages debates with some being declared draws, some wins for Lord and some wins for Graham by the experts. Opinion polls showed the Conservatives with a lead in the early days of the campaign but the last few weeks showed ties or slight edges to the Liberals within the margin of error.\n\nOn election day, Shawn Graham and the Liberals won the most seats, however, they lost the popular vote. Bernard Lord was the first premier not elected to a third term since Hugh John Flemming lost his bid for a third term in the 1960 election while the NDP suffered a considerable blow being shut out of the legislature despite having won a seat in 5 of the last 6 elections and seeing their popular vote slip 4% to their worst showing since the 1974 election.\n\nThe Fredericton Daily Gleaner reported on August 11, 2006 that they had asked the leaders of each party for what they thought the key issues of the campaign would be:\n\nAn opinion poll, conducted for CTV Atlantic by the Innovative Research Group the last week of the campaign found the follow issues were top of mind for voters:\n\nMany new and changed districts will be used for the first time in this election as a result of an electoral redistribution.\n\nLegend\n\n\n\nThe only inter-election opinion polling regularly conducted in New Brunswick is by the Halifax, Nova Scotia-based Corporate Research Associates. Every CRA poll from the November 2003 to June 2006 showed the Liberals in the lead by varying amounts. However, their last pre-election poll, released on June 12, 2006, showed the Progressive Conservatives making a comeback with 45% to 39% for the Liberals and 9% for the NDP. The CRA poll conducted during the 2003 election campaign showed the Liberals and PCs tied at 41% each, the only polling company to predict the close result that became of that campaign.\n\nPolls conducted during the election campaign - Figures represent decided voters\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> This poll reused the same sample as the August 22–24 poll and is therefore not a random sampling and not technically an opinion poll.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2233634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233634", "title": "Fast Infoset", "text": "Fast Infoset\n\nFast Infoset (or FI) is an international standard that specifies a binary encoding format for the XML Information Set (\"XML Infoset\") as an alternative to the XML document format. It aims to provide more efficient serialization than the text-based XML format.\n\nFI is effectively a lossless compression, analogous to \"gzip\", for XML, except that while the original formatting is lost, no information is lost in the conversion from XML to FI, and back to XML. While the purpose of compression is to reduce physical data size, FI aims to optimize both document size and processing performance.\n\nThe Fast Infoset specification is defined by both the ITU-T and the ISO standards bodies. FI is officially defined in \"ITU-T Rec. X.891\" and \"ISO/IEC 24824-1,\" and entitled \"Fast Infoset\". The standard was published by ITU-T on May 14, 2005, and by ISO on May 4, 2007. The Fast Infoset standard document can be downloaded from the ITU website. Though the document does not assert intellectual property (IP) restrictions on implementation or use, page ii warns that it has received notices and the subject may not be completely free of IP assertions.\n\nA common misconception is that FI requires ASN.1 tool support. Although the formal specification uses ASN.1 notation, the standard includes Encoding Control Notation (ECN) and ASN.1 tools are not required by implementations.\n\nAn alternative to FI is FleXPath.\n\nThe underlying file format is ASN.1, with tag/length/value blocks. Text values of attributes and elements are stored with length prefixes rather than end delimiters, and data segments do not require escapement for special characters. The equivalent of end tags (\"terminators\") are needed only at the end of a list of child-elements. Binary data is transmitted in native format, and need not be converted to a transmission format such as base64.\n\nFast Infoset is a higher level format built on ASN.1 forms and notation. Element and attribute names are stored within the octet stream, unlike traditional ASN.1 encoding schemes. In consequence, The conventional XML file can be recovered from the binary stream without reference the XML Schema, and the XML Schema need not be expressed as an ASN.1 definition. (ASN.1 \"Tags\" are just type names, e.g. String, Integer, or complex types.) ASN.1 together with ECN is used to define the file format.\n\nAn index table is built for most strings, which includes element and attribute names, and their values. This means that the text of repeated tags and values only appears once per document.\n\nA Java implementation of the FI specification is available as part of the GlassFish project. The library is open source and is distributed under the terms of the Apache License 2.0. Several projects use this implementation, including the reference implementation for JAX-WS used in GlassFish Metro.\nQtitanFastInfoset - implementation for C++ is available under commercial license as a component for Digia Qt Framework.\n\nBecause Fast Infosets are compressed as part of the XML generation process, they are much faster than using Zip-style compression algorithms on an XML stream, although the output is not as well compressed.\n\nSAX-type parsing performance of Fast Infoset is also much faster than parsing performance of XML 1.0, even without any Zip-style compression. Typical increases in parsing speed observed for the reference Java implementation are a factor of 10 over Java Xerces, and a factor of 4 over the Piccolo driver (one of the fastest Java-based XML parsers).\n\nPortable devices – Mobile devices typically have low bandwidth data connections and slower CPUs. Fast Infoset uses less bandwidth than XML and is faster to process, making it a superior choice.\n\nStoring large volumes of data – When storing XML to either file or database, the volume of data a system produces can often exceed reasonable limits, with a number of detriments: the access times go up as more data is read, CPU load goes up as XML data takes more power to process, and storage costs go up. By storing XML data in Fast Infoset format, data volume may be reduced by as much as 80 percent.\n\nPassing XML through the Internet – When an application passes data over the internet, network bandwidth can be a major bottleneck, seriously degrading the performance of client applications and limiting the server's power to process requests. Reducing the size of data transferred across the internet reduces the time required to send or receive the message, and increases the number of transactions a server can process per hour.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2233640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233640", "title": "Porcupine (album)", "text": "Porcupine (album)\n\nPorcupine is the third studio album by the English post-punk band Echo & the Bunnymen. First released on 4 February 1983, it became the band's highest charting release when it reached number two on the UK Albums Chart despite initially receiving poor reviews. It also reached number 137 on the American \"Billboard\" 200, number 85 on the Canadian \"RPM\" 100 Albums and number 24 on the Swedish chart. In 1984 the album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry. \"Porcupine\" included the singles \"The Back of Love\" and \"The Cutter\".\n\nThe album was recorded at Trident Studios in London, Rockfield Studios in South Wales and Amazon Studios in Liverpool. It was produced by Ian Broudie, who was credited as \"Kingbird\" and who had co-produced the band's first album, 1980's \"Crocodiles\", and their second single, \"Rescue\". After being rejected by the band's label, the album was re-recorded with Shankar providing strings. It was originally released as an LP in 1983 before being reissued on CD in 1988. The album was again reissued on CD in 2003, along with the other four of the band's first five studio albums, having been remastered and expanded. A VHS video called \"Porcupine – An Atlas Adventure\" was also released containing six promotional videos of tracks from the album.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Heaven Up Here\" in 1981, Echo & the Bunnymen had difficulty writing new material for their next album despite rehearsing five days each week at The Ministry, their rehearsal room in Liverpool. While lead singer Ian McCulloch still wanted them to be the best band in the world, bass player Les Pattinson was expressing his weariness with the music industry, drummer Pete de Freitas produced and played drums on Liverpool band The Wild Swans' debut single \"Revolutionary Spirit\", and lead guitarist Will Sergeant recorded a solo album of instrumental music called \"Themes for <nowiki>'Grind'</nowiki>\" (1982).\n\nOn 27 January 1982 Echo & the Bunnymen recorded their fourth session for British disc jockey John Peel's radio show on BBC Radio 1. Of the tracks recorded, \"Smack in the Middle\" was renamed and became \"Higher Hell\" on the album, while \"Taking Advantage\" was renamed \"The Back of Love\" and became the band's third single which was also included on the album. Ian Broudie, who had co-produced 1980's \"Crocodiles\" and who was Sergeant's flatmate, was chosen to produce \"The Back of Love\" and the band's third album, whose working title was \"The Happy Loss\". The single, which became the band's first UK Top 20 hit single, was recorded in early 1982 at Trident Studios in Soho, London. This was unusual as the band's manager, Bill Drummond, had previously been keen to keep the band away from the temptations of London. The recording session for \"The Back of Love\" went well, but the relationship between the band members was strained, with them either not speaking to each other or, when they did, arguing. Drummond was aware of the tensions within the band and so arranged a tour in Scotland for April 1982. This was done in an effort to make the band work harder, write some songs, and to communicate with each other. Drummond's plan failed to work as following the tour there was still tension between the band members. Two other album tracks – \"Clay\" and \"My White Devil\" – were first played during the tour of Scotland.\n\nFollowing the release of \"The Back of Love\" on 21 May 1982, the band spent the summer, first playing at the inaugural WOMAD festival, and then playing at various European music festivals. After the summer the band resumed recording the album at Rockfield Studios in South Wales – which had been used for the band's first two albums – and also at Amazon Studios in Liverpool. Recording the album was a slow process, de Freitas said, \"\"Porcupine\" was very hard to actually write and record [...] \"Heaven Up Here\" was pure confidence, we did it really quickly; we had a great time doing it – but this one was like we had to drag it out of ourselves.\" McCulloch later said that when recording the album, the mood between the band members was \"horrible\".\n\nWhen presented with the finished album, WEA rejected it as \"too uncommercial\". The band agreed to re-record the album, despite Sergeant's complaints. Using the original version of the album as a blueprint, the follow-up recording sessions went more smoothly. Drummond brought Shankar back to add strings to the other tracks on the album. It was these sessions that produced the band's next single, \"The Cutter\", which was released in January 1983 and went on to become the band's first Top 10 hit.\n\nAfter Echo & the Bunnymen had finished recording \"Porcupine\" they played a free show in early November 1982 for people at Sefton Park in Liverpool. Following this, WEA asked for three music videos and album art for the new album. The band's lighting engineer Bill Butt was chosen to direct the videos and Brian Griffin was chosen to take the photographs for the album's cover – as he had done for the band's two previous albums. With a budget of £ Butt decided that it would be possible to get the photographs for the album cover and also to produce a half-hour film. Deciding that he wanted the videos to reflect the frigid feel of the music on the album, Butt chose to shoot the videos in Scotland. However, it was not certain that there would be enough snow in Scotland during November so Iceland was chosen as the location to shoot the videos.\n\nFilming took place on and near the frozen Gullfoss waterfall near Reykjavík. Feeling it was a dangerous process, McCulloch said in 1993, \"If we had slipped there wasn't anything for hundreds of feet below us.\" In 2001 Griffin said, \"[...] the sun barely appeared the whole time we were there. To walk, stand up, or just think seemed a massive effort.\" Despite the danger the filming proved its worth when the British music magazine \"Q\" said in 2001, \"The \"Porcupine\" cover is the epitome of rock band as heroic archetype – young men on some ill-defined but glorious mission, one easily as timeless as the stars and the sea.\" The filming was finished in December 1982 with the band performing songs from the album at their rehearsal room at The Ministry. Butt interspersed this with clips from the 1929 Russian documentary \"The Man With the Movie Camera\" and he also projected psychedelic watercolour effects onto the band. A VHS video was subsequently released by Castle Hendring in 1983 called \"Porcupine – An Atlas Adventure\" which contained the six music videos – \"In Bluer Skies\", \"The Cutter\", \"My White Devil\", \"Porcupine\", \"Heads Will Roll\" and \"The Back of Love\".\n\nDescribing the album cover, journalist Dave Rimmer wrote in British music magazine \"Smash Hits\", \"Iceland does seem an appropriate location for this group. It's isolated, cold, bleak and fits perfectly with the moody image they've attracted to themselves.\"\n\nAfter WEA rejected the first version of the album, Shankar – who had played strings on \"The Back of Love\" – was brought back by Drummond to add strings to the remainder of the album in an effort to give it a brighter production and to build on the success of the strings used on the single. When recording \"The Cutter\", Sergeant had asked Shankar if he could suggest the melody from Cat Stevens' 1967 hit \"Matthew and Son\".\n\nIn 1984 McCulloch said, \"I think \"Porcupine\" was a classic autobiographical album, the most honest thing that I'd ever written or sung.\" Talking about how the album made him feel, he went on to say, \"I found the material from it really heavy to play – like, really oppressive. That's the only reason why I didn't like the album. The songs were great but it didn't make me happy.\" He also said, \"A lot of songs are about coming to terms with the opposites in me.\"\n\n\"Porcupine\" was first released as an LP by Korova in the United Kingdom on 4 February 1983. It was subsequently released in the United States by Sire Records on 23 February 1983. The original album had ten tracks with five tracks on each side. Like Echo & the Bunnymen's previous album, the album cover was designed by Martyn Atkins and the photography was by Brian Griffin. The album was released on CD on 7 April 1988.\n\nAlong with the other four of the band's first five albums, \"Porcupine\" was remastered and reissued on CD in 2003 – these releases were marketed as 25th anniversary editions. Seven bonus tracks were added to the album: \"Fuel\" was the second B-side track on the 12-inch version of \"The Back of Love\"; alternate versions of \"The Cutter\", \"My White Devil\", \"Porcupine\", \"Ripeness\" and \"Gods Will Be Gods\" which were all early versions recorded during the album's sessions; and \"Never Stop (Discotheque)\" the 12-inch version of the non-album single which was released after \"Porcupine\". The alternate versions of \"My White Devil\", \"Porcupine\" and \"Ripeness\" had all previously been unissued. The reissued album was produced by Andy Zax and Bill Inglot.\n\nThere were two tracks from the original \"Porcupine\" album which had been released as singles. The first of these was \"The Back of Love\" which had been released on 21 May 1982. The second single was \"The Cutter\" which was released on 14 January 1983. \"Never Stop (Discotheque)\", which was originally a non-album single when it was released on 8 July 1983, was subsequently included on the 2003 remastered version of the album as a bonus track.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Porcupine\" in 1983, \"NME\" reviewer Barney Hoskyns gave the album a negative review. Hoskyns wrote, \"\"Porcupine\" is the distressing occasion of an important and exciting rock group becoming ensnared by its own strongest points, a dynamic force striving fruitlessly to escape the brilliant track that trails behind it.\" Hoskyns likened the sound of the album to the band \"turning on their own greatest 'hits' and savaging them\". Hoskyns also criticised McCulloch's lyrics and the general mood of the album, noting, \"Only on 'Porcupine' itself do the various strains of despair coalesce\", and dismissed the entire second side of the album, saying it \"horrifies the more for its uniform lack of inspiration, for the fact that every number cops direct from earlier songs without preserving anything of their energy or invention\". \"Record\" reviewer Wayne King similarly commented that the album reused many motifs, such as Ian McCullough's octave jumps, from their previous albums. While he praised the opening tracks \"The Cutter\" and \"Back of Love\", he remarked that \"Porcupine\" as a whole was not nearly as good an album as Echo and the Bunnymen's live performances showed they were capable of.\n\nIn a review of the original release on AllMusic, \"Porcupine\" was described as a \"solid outing\", a \"noticeably better listen than its predecessor, \"Heaven Up Here\"\" and \"well worth hearing\". When reviewing the remastered 2003 version the review was expanded to add that new release was \"a very well done expansion of an already fine album\". \"Blender\" magazine described the album in a review on their website as \"impossibly exciting pop-rock\" and Pitchfork called the album \"the band's definitive statement\" and described the track \"The Back of Love\" as \"the astonishing highlight of the group's career\". \"CMJ\" critic Eric Chappe wrote that \"the constant emotional peaks and valleys of \"Porcupine\" may be perhaps too strong for some, but the musical peaks achieved in getting there are really something to behold.\" The album appeared in the 1983 end of year critics' lists for both \"Melody Maker\", where it was listed at number nine, and \"NME\", where it was listed at number 32. The album is also listed in the 2006 book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\".\n\nThe album reached number 2 on the UK Albums Chart, number 137 on the American \"Billboard\" 200, number 85 on the Canadian \"RPM\" 100 Albums, and number 24 on the Swedish albums chart. Having sold over copies of the album in the UK, Echo & they Bunnymen were awarded with a gold disc by the British Phonographic Industry. Of the singles from the album, \"The Back of Love\" reached number 19 on the UK Singles Chart and \"The Cutter\" reached number 8. \"The Back of Love\" also became the band's first single to make the Irish Singles Chart when it reached number 24, while \"The Cutter\" reached number 10. The single \"Never Stop (Discotheque)\" reached number 15 on the UK Singles Chart and number 8 on the Irish Singles Chart.\n\nAll tracks written by Will Sergeant, Ian McCulloch, Les Pattinson and Pete de Freitas.\n\n\n\n\nwith:\n\n"}

Ranchi city, the capital of Jharkhand state is the district headquarters. It was established as a district in 1899. \n\nIt was made the capital of Jharkhand state which was formed in 2000 from Bihar state. As of 2011 it is the most populous district of Jharkhand (out of 24).\n\nThe early evidence of use of several Iron slag, pot sheds, Iron tools found in Chota Nagpur region around 1400 BCE.\nMagadha Empire exercised indirect control over the territory, which lasted until the reign of the Ashoka. Kalinga rulers are believed to have ravaged the region during their expeditions to Rajgir and Pataliputra. Armies of Samudra Gupta passed through the region on their expedition to Deccan. After the decline of the Guptas, Phanimukut established the Nagvanshi dynasty, which ruled Ranchi district and part of Chota Nagpur Plateau as a sovereign king for almost next 1000 years. Khukhragarh was one of Capital of Nagvanshi dynasty.\n\nWith the expansion of the Mughal Empire, the sovereign status of the Nag Dynasty was technically affected, but they continued to rule and administer independently until the advent of the East India Company. Thakur Vishwanath Shahdeo, Pandey Ganpat Rai, Tikait Umrao Singh and Sheikh Bhikhari played pivotal role in Indian Rebellion of 1857. During the period of the British Raj, adivasis and the local population of other ethnic backgrounds of Ranchi and other regions currently comprising the State of Jharkhand continued to oppose the subjugation by the British, and the region witnessed a number of uprisings and revolts.\n\nRanchi has a humid subtropical climate. However, due to its position and the forests around the city, it is known for its pleasant climate. Its climate is the primary reason why Ranchi was once the summer capital of the undivided State of Bihar. Ranchi used to be a preferable hill station in the past. Temperature ranges from maximum 42 to 20 °C during summer, and from 25 to 0 °C during winter. December and January are the coolest months with temperature getting to freezing point in some places of the city. The annual rainfall is about 1430 mm (56.34 inches). From June to September the rainfall is about 1,100 mm.\nRanchi is located at 23°21′N 85°20′E.[5] The total area covered by the Ranchi municipal area is 175.12 square kilometres and the average elevation of the city is 651 m above sea level.\n\nRanchi is located on the southern part of the Chota Nagpur plateau which forms the eastern edge of the Deccan plateau. Ranchi is referred to as the \"City of Waterfalls\", due to the presence of numerous large and small falls of around the close vicinity of the city. The most popular ones are Dassam Falls, Hundru Falls, Jonha Falls, Hirni Falls and Panchghagh Falls.\n\nThe Subarnarekha river and its tributaries constitute the local river system. Dams in Kanke, Rukka and Hatia have been built over these channels to cater to the water requirements of majority the population.\n\nRanchi has a hilly topography and its combination with dense tropical forests ensures that it enjoys a comparatively moderate climate compared to the rest of the state. Previously, it was accorded a 'hill station' status during the British rule. Rapid population growth and industrialization have caused considerable change in the weather pattern and rise in average temperatures. This has resulted in gradual loss of this \"Hill Station\" like status.\nIt also has numerous dams constructed in different regions of the city inside and on the outskirts.\n\nIn 2006 the Indian government named Ranchi one of the country's 250 most backward districts (out of a total of 640). It is one of the 23 districts in Jharkhand currently receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF).\n\nPresently, Ranchi district is divided into 2 sub-divisions and 14 administrative blocks. On 12 September 2007, Khunti district was created by carving Khunti subdivision and its 6 blocks out of Ranchi district.\n\nRanchi sub-division is further divided into 11 blocks: Angara, Burmu, Bero, Chanho, Kanke, Lapung, Mandar, Namkum, Ormanjhi, Ratu and Silli. Bundu sub-division comprises 3 blocks: Bundu, Sonahatu,and Tamar, \n\nThe district has 7 Vidhan Sabha constituencies, namely, Tamar, Silli, Khijri, Ranchi, Hatia, Kanke, and Mandar. Silli, Khijri, Ranchi, Hatia and Kanke are part of Ranchi Lok Sabha constituency.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census Ranchi district has a population of 2,914,253, roughly equal to the nation of Jamaica or the US state of Arkansas. This gives it a ranking of 130th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 23.9%. Ranchi has a sex ratio of 950 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 77.13%.\nSchedule Caste (SC) constitutes 5.2% while Schedule Tribe (ST) were 35.8% of total population in Ranchi district of Jharkhand.\nAt the time of the 2011 Census of India, 70.02% of the population in the district spoke Hindi, 8.55% Urdu, 7.52% Kurukh, 4.79% Santali, 4.70% Mundari, 2.51% Bengali and 0.70% Maithili as their first language.\n\nLanguages spoken here include Hindi as the main language. Nagpuri and Kurmali are local language. Asuri, an Austroasiatic language spoken by approximately 17,000, partly in the north of Ranchi; and Bijori, a Munda language distantly related to Khmer and Vietnamese, spoken by about 25,000.Kurukh language is partly spoken in West of Ranchi ( mainly by Kurukh people).\n\nRanchi district boasts of many premier institutes in the field of higher education. This may be a reason that Ranchi has an average literacy rate of 77.13%(census 2011), higher than the national average of 74.04%: male literacy is 85.63%, and female literacy is 68.2%.Some of the popular schools for education in ranchi are Loyola Convent School, Delhi Public School, Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Kairali School, St.Xavier's School, St. Thomas School and Bishop Westcott. \n\n\nRanchi district consists of 18 Blocks.\nThe following are the list of the Blocks in Ranchi district:\n\n"}

Duncan\n\nRobert Blackford Duncan (December 4, 1920April 29, 2011) was an American politician from the state of Oregon. A Democrat, he served multiple terms in the Oregon Legislative Assembly and as a U.S. congressman from Oregon. In the Oregon House of Representatives he served as speaker for four years, and in the U.S. House he represented two different districts. The Illinois native and World War II veteran ran three unsuccessful campaigns to be elected to the U.S. Senate.\n\nRobert B. Duncan was born in Normal, Illinois, on December 4, 1920. His father, Eugene Duncan, came to Illinois from a family in Missouri whose ascendants were originally from Scotland. His mother, Catherine Blackford, was of Welsh origin—her parents had immigrated from Wales to the United States in the late 19th century. Robert \"Bob\" Duncan was the second of four boys: Carter, Bob, Clark and John Bruce. He attended public schools in Bloomington. In 1939, at the age of 18, he went with a friend to Alaska and he began college at the University of Alaska, staying through 1940 when he transferred to Illinois Wesleyan University where he graduated in 1942 with a bachelor's degree. In college he met fellow student Marijane Beverly Dill (born June 30, 1920) and the two were married on December 19, 1942. The couple would have seven children together: Nancy Guri, Angus, David, James, Laurie, Bonnie Dee and Jeanne. While in Alaska he had worked in the gold fields, and while in Illinois he had worked for a bank and seed company.\n\nDuring World War II, he served in the United States Merchant Marine and in the United States Naval Air Force as a pilot from 1942 to 1945. In 1948, Duncan received his LL.B from the University of Michigan Law School and passed the bar in October of that year. After graduation Duncan and his family moved from Michigan to Portland and then to Medford in Southern Oregon, where he moved to join the law practice of William M. McAllister.\n\nIn 1954, Duncan was nominated as a write-in candidate for the Oregon House of Representatives. Although he declined for economic reasons, in 1956, he was elected to the Oregon House, serving three terms and was elected Speaker of the Oregon House by his colleagues. In 1962, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives representing Oregon's 4th congressional district based in Medford.\nIn the 1966 U.S. Senate election, Duncan was the Democratic candidate for the seat vacated by retiring Senator Maurine B. Neuberger. While Duncan strongly supported President Johnson's Vietnam War policies, his Republican opponent, Governor Mark Hatfield, was an outspoken critic. The differences between Duncan and Hatfield on the war would produce one of the great splits in the modern Oregon Democratic Party. The state's senior U.S. Senator, Wayne Morse—a staunch Democratic opponent of the Vietnam War—endorsed Hatfield over fellow Democrat Duncan, an act that infuriated Democratic Party regulars. This factor, along with Hatfield's statewide popularity, gave Hatfield a narrow victory. In 1967, Duncan moved to Portland where he lived until 1974, returning to the practice of law.\n\nIn 1968, Duncan came back to challenge Senator Morse in the Democratic Senate primary. Again, Duncan's war views played a role. Though Duncan was initially far ahead of the anti-war maverick Morse, Morse closed the gap at the end and won a narrow victory, aided by the beginning of the Paris Peace Accords, which brought the possibility of the end of the war. Morse went on to narrowly lose in the general election to Republican state Representative Bob Packwood, who favored continued funding of the war.\n\nDuncan returned to his Portland law practice. He ran once more for the Senate in 1972, again losing the Democratic nomination to Morse, this time by a wider margin. Morse then lost to Senator Hatfield. After Edith Green retired from Congress, Duncan ran for her Portland-based seat from in 1974 and returned to the House. He served another three terms, and was upset in the 1980 Democratic primary by eventual winner Ron Wyden.\n\nIn 1985, he returned to live in Oregon, settling in the coastal community of Yachats. He served on the Northwest Power Planning Council from 1984 to 1988, and as its chairperson in 1987. Following his work on the Council (he left the Council in 1988), Duncan spent his time working on his house in Yachats and on his collection of old cars, and spending time with his seven grandchildren.\n\nDuncan's first wife, Marijane, died November 9, 1990. The couple had seven children. In 1995, Duncan married Kathryn Boe, widow of Jason Boe who had served in the Oregon Senate from 1970 to 1980, four terms as Senate president. Duncan lived in Portland until his death at the age of 90 at the Mirabella retirement home on April 29, 2011.\n\nHis papers are housed in the Robert Blackford Duncan collection at the University of Oregon. A four volume book of his writings is in that collection and also is in the archival collections of Illinois Wesleyan University, Normal, Illinois; the University of Alaska in Fairbanks; and the Oregon Historical Society, Portland.\n\n"}
{"id": "2233682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233682", "title": "Rufus C. Holman", "text": "Rufus C. Holman\n\nRufus Cecil Holman (October 14, 1877November 27, 1959) was an American politician and businessman in the state of Oregon. A conservative Republican and native Oregonian, he served as United States Senator for a single term during World War II. He previously had been the state treasurer and served on the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners.\n\nRunning for re-election in May 1944, Holman was defeated in the Republican primary by Wayne Morse. He thereafter retired from political life.\n\nRufus Holman was born in Portland, Oregon, on October 14, 1877. There he received his education in the public schools and became a teacher in 1896. After leaving teaching in 1898, he worked in various fields from farming and operating a steamboat, to pursuits related to the accounting field until 1910. That year Holman began making record keeping books and paper boxes in Portland. He then worked in the cold storage business and was active in civic affairs.\n\nHolman won his first election to political office in 1914, when he was elected to the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners, where he served two four-year terms (1914–22)\n\nDuring the middle 1920s, Holman was an active member of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) in Oregon, serving as an officer in that organization.\n\nIn 1931, Oregon Governor Julius L. Meier appointed him as state Treasurer after Thomas B. Kay died in office. He began in office on May 1, 1931, winning election to a full four-year term in 1932, and winning re-election in 1936. He resigned from the office in 1938, leaving on December 27, 1938.\n\nHolman was strongly concerned about the environment. In 1937, he garnered publicity when he demonstrated the polluted state of the Willamette River by briefly holding a cage of salmon in the water, then quickly pulling them out dying to a shocked audience.\n\nIn 1938, he was elected to the United States Senate. As Senator, Holman was critical of the foreign policy of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, taking a strongly isolationist position which placed him on the right wing of Oregon politics. As a Senator Holman was a staunch opponent of liberalizing immigration laws to allow easier immigration by Jews and other persecuted Europeans, a position which was deeply resented by Oregon's small but politically potent Jewish population, who quickly came to view the former KKK member Holman as anti-semitic and who sought his electoral defeat.\n\nWhile attenuating his isolationism after the December 1941 Attack on Pearl Harbor, coming to support the war effort, Holman's name remained indissolubly tied with the now politically unpopular isolationist position and he faced a high profile challenge in the May 1944 Republican primary from progressive Wayne Morse.\n\nDuring his 1944 re-election bid, Holman publicly charged that Morse was a stalking horse for the Democrats, who, facing a severe deficit in party registrations in Oregon, needed a fissure in the Republican camp to capture the Senate seat in November. When this conspiratorial theory did not gain traction, Holman proffered a new theory detailing an alleged plot involving the Portland shipyards of Henry J. Kaiser were being systematically used to stack the Republican primary against him. Newspaper editors around Oregon made hay over the conspiratorially-minded Senator, with one declaring that \"like the ants, he has misplaced the center of the universe.\"\n\nWhile the incumbent Holman won a majority of Oregon's counties, taking 20 to Morse's 16, it was Morse who dominated in populous Multnomah and Lane counties, winning the primary by a plurality of 10,000 votes out of more than 143,000 votes cast in a three-cornered race.\n\nAfter his 1944 defeat, Holman returned to private life and never sought public office again. Holman returned to managing the Portland Paper Box Company in Portland, before retiring to his farm near Molalla, Oregon.\n\nHolman died on November 27, 1959, in his home town of Portland. He was buried at River View Cemetery in Portland.\n\nHolman's great-nephew, Ralph M. Holman, was a justice of the Oregon Supreme Court.\n\n"}

{"id": "2233693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233693", "title": "Suomisaundi", "text": "Suomisaundi\n\nSuomisaundi (), also known as suomisoundi, suomistyge or spugedelic trance, is a style of psychedelic trance that originated in Finland around the mid-1990s. \"Suomisaundi\" literally means \"Finnish sound\" in Finnish; music that features many of the characteristics of suomisaundi has gained global popularity.\n\nSometime during the early years of the 90s, a party collective Ruskababa introduced Goa trance to a handful of enthusiasts through their covert summertime party activities. The music in these parties were typically played from DAT tapes, or even from cassette tapes and included mostly hits from Goa from the previous season's parties. Pepe Kosminen was one of the DJ's playing these new psychedelic tunes to the Finnish audience in Ruskababa parties.\n\nLargely due to these influences coming from Goa, certain DJ's started to include Goa trance hits in their sets, and new party collectives emerged. The first new collective was Smooth Underground which organised the last of its parties in a warehouse in Herttoniemi, with Ville Tikkanen playing Goa trance for the first time in Finland in a more conventional trance setting. After the dismantling of Smooth Underground, another group, Löyhä was formed. Löyhä was the first party collective to put a special focus on promoting locally made music. Inspired by the covert party tradition of Ruskababa and Smooth Underground, the group was determined to push the boundaries of organising unlicensed parties in an urban environment. It was not uncommon for the early organisers to experience issues with the authorities related to the parties.\n\nThe first time Suomisaundi reached global circulation was during the 95/96 season in Goa, when DAT tape recordings of early songs produced by Tim Thick became an overnight sensation within the gatekeepers of the underground Goa trance DJ scene. The sounds and themes found in these short FastTracker 2 songs, and the inspiring response they had received globally, became the basic building blocks of the Suomisaundi phenomena.\n\nArguably the genre-defining Suomisaundi album is the self-published compilation, 'Flippin Bixies', in 1996. It was the first album to directly answer to the rapidly growing need for a new localised sound, that had been created over the previous years by the party collectives and the general popularization of electronic music. The album was named after a private recording studio that was located near Kurvi in Helsinki around mid 90s.\nIn 1997 Exogenic Records became the first record label to focus on Suomisaundi and approximately during the same time Midiliitto was founded as an association focusing on the advancement of production and commercialisation of Suomisaundi. Pepe Kosminen was the founding Chairman of Midiliitto. Together with Flippin Bixies, Midiliitto counted within its members many of the future international stars of Suomisaundi, including the members of groups like Texas Faggott and Squaremeat.\n\nInitially there was criticism of Suomisaundi because early examples of the genre suffered from lack of production standards and inconsistent quality. These criticisms, however, grew increasingly inaccurate as the average production quality improved significantly and the availability of music improved significantly. In 2000 Tim Thick launched Thixx'n'Dixx, a website that hosted a massive catalogue of Suomisaundi in an easy-to-access format.\n\nThixx'n'Dixx grew so popular that it was mentioned in a pop music program on Finnish national TV. Tim is widely credited for being the first to produce tracks closely resembling the modern Suomisaundi in -94, earning him a cult status within the global Goa trance DJ and party organiser community over the course of the following year.\n\nAfter site-hosting problems and excessive bandwidth usage, the Thixx'n'Dixx site operates nowadays merely as a suomisaundi link catalogue, offering links to individual suomisaundi artist pages at mikseri.net, which is a Finnish MP3 community for unsigned/independent artists. Another popular MP3 download site for suomisaundi music is the Antiscarp-website, hosted by members of the Finnish psytrance group Salakavala.\n\nSince 2000, the global interest in Finnish trance has grown significantly, with many Finnish groups touring internationally and performing to a growing global fan base. However, usually outside Finland, the Suomi-style is still considered an eccentricity within the context of the psytrance genre. Most notable suomisaundi audiences outside Finland are in Russia, Ukraine, Japan and Australia. The Japanese label, 6-Dimension Soundz, concentrates almost exclusively on releasing suomi-style trance.\n\nSteady fanbases in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Russia and Eastern Europe led to non-Finnish producers creating Finnish style psytrance music around the world. The term \"Suomisaundi\" is typically used only to describe music that is produced in Finland whereas music produced in the suomi tradition but outside of Finland is more loosely described as \"freestyle psytrance.\"\n\nThe genre is generally not as formulaic as most current psytrance, with artists having more freedom to explore their own individual sounds and styles. The most recognizable element of this style is that it has no set rules apart from basic trance elements such as the four-on-the-floor kick drum that has characterized the majority of electronic dance music styles to date. Suomisaundi tracks are usually very melodic and eclectic, typically with heavy influence from early Goa, tribal house and acid trance and as well as—departing from classical psychedelic trance—some degree of influence from funk music (e.g., incorporation of funky horn, guitar, or keyboard loops) oftentimes decorated with sounds and ambience reminiscent of \"retro\" video games.\n\nSongs frequently include distorted sampling, layers and combinations of effects, tricky drum fills and breaks, as well as speech samples in Finnish or in English. On many occasions there are forms of strange humor and/or self-irony in the music or in the track titles. Some even describe the suomi-style of psytrance as anarchistic and almost punk in the trance music scene, even dadaist, because the songs are usually very different and progressive (or exploratory) compared to mainstream European psytrance tracks. Conversely, mainstream psychedelic trance comparatively sounds more \"serious\" than suomisaundi.\n\nAdditionally, suomisaundi bass tends to differ from conventional European psytrance in patch design, equalization, and rhythmic distinction. For example, bass patches tend to be less punchy (i.e., have a slower attack) and often breaks a “rule” followed by European and Israeli producers: never overlap kick drum and bass notes.\n\nSome artists such as Luomuhappo and Tekniset have incorporated Finnish folk melodies into their tracks, giving their music a more distinct Finnish sound. Finnish nature has also played an important role in the direction of the Finnish sound, with Suomisaundi parties frequently taking place in the forests of Finland and tracks and albums often referencing this aspect of the genre, for example Puoskari's album \"Open the Forest\" and Haltya's \"Forest Flavor\" and \"Book of Nature\" albums.\n\n\"Texas Faggott\", released by Australian Psy-Harmonics label in 1999, is the first commercially successful Suomisaundi record. The album was also likely to have been among the first to create interest within the traditional trance crowd.\n\nThe popularity of \"Texas Faggott\" grew amongst the Finnish trance scene with their second release, \"Petoman's Peflett\" in 2001. Group member Tim Thick has been an active promoter of Finnish psy-trance, as he established and operated Thixx'n'Dixx (http://thixxndixx.stc.cx/) in 2000, a site offering free MP3 downloads from almost all of the existing Finnish psy-trance artists including tracks from his own groups.\n\nPelinpala released his album \"My CD has landed on the nextdoor neighbours dog\" in October 1999 on the legendary Demon Tea recordings (Australia). Pelinpala's album was a mixture of extreme psychedelia and is considered one of the classic psychedelic Suomisaundi albums. Pelinpala later became active in another well established Finnish old school psychedelic project: Haltya.\n\nSo far Haltya has released three albums, \"Forest Flavor\", \"Electric Help Elves\" and \"Book of Nature\" and a good number of other published works in their unique style of funky forest sound. Haltya is considered to be one of the psy originals in the world, due to their characteristic approach in music. They are one of Finland's most wanted live acts abroad. The main figure behind Pelinpala and Haltya is producer/composer Tommi Sirkiä, who is responsible for a wide range of musical contributions in Finnish modern electronic dance music, and is one of Finland's most internationally acknowledged electronic music producers today.\n\nSquaremeat has created a unique \"power disco\" sound, releasing several well-received albums. Squaremeat's Pepe Kosminen is a long-time trance producer and a true pioneer of the Finnish psychedelic trance movement with more than 20 years as an active contributor in the scene, producing solo albums as well as collaborations with other artists within the genre. Projects that Pepe has been a part of include F-Virus, Flying Scorpions, Gruuvit Muuvit, Midilitto, Nano Buds, Lightaman Jr. and Dirty Dreds.\n\nIn its debut album \"The Final Truth 2020\" Shiwa2000 continued in honour to the FastTracker 2 culture that had almost died out of the Suomisaundi scene together with its growing commercialisation. Together with others, the already then legendary underground musician Rick Timebees created the album that proved that FT2 could be used to create studio quality psychedelic trance. With its tongue in cheek approach, Shiwa2000 amplified many of the already brewing ingredients of Suomisaundi; fundamentally speaking psychedelia and parody. Rick's greatest contribution to Suomisaundi, and to the world of music in general, is his dedicated work towards refining the art and science of tupla-isku. Arguably the single most important innovation in the history of trance music.\n\nShiwa2000 was the first ever release on Karelia Records, an early investor in Suomisaundi with its founders coming from various backgrounds mentioned elsewhere in this article. Two of the Suomisaundi labels with the most releases are Exogenic Records and Freakdance Records, but many of the popular Finnish trance-artists might not have recorded, making their music only available as MP3s on the Internet.\n\nThe term \"spugedelic\" is comically derived from \"psychedelic\" and \"spuge\", meaning \"an alcoholic\" in Helsinki slang. The term \"spugedelic\" was likely first used by suomisaundi artist Huopatossu Mononen, releasing a track called \"Kikapelaus (A Spugedelik Return To Monoverse).\"\n\n"}

He spent most of his career at the University of Oxford, and worked on numerous topics. Throughout his career, he showed strong preferences for experimental methods in social psychology, having little time for alternative approaches such as discourse analysis.\nMichael Argyle was born in Nottingham on 11 August 1925. He was educated at Nottingham High School for Boys. After completing with distinction a Royal Air Force science course at the University of Cambridge he trained as a navigator in Canada (1943-7). In June 1949 Michael married Sonia Kemp and they had four children, Miranda (1952), Nick (1954), Rosalind (1957) and Ophelia (1963). After the war he read part one in moral sciences at Emmanuel College, Cambridge and in 1950 graduated with first class honours in experimental psychology. Following two years of postgraduate study in Cambridge he became the first ever lecturer in social psychology at the University of Oxford, where he worked for many years. At the time, Oxford University was, along with the London School of Economics, one of only two universities in the United Kingdom to have a department of social psychology. He became a fellow of the newly founded Wolfson College, Oxford in 1966 and three years later a reader. He was one of the very early pioneers of social psychology in the UK and Europe and helped to initiate the \"British Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology\" as the first social psychology editor (1961-7). In 1968 he set up a social skills training programme at Littlemore Hospital, Oxford. He chaired the social psychology section of the British Psychological Society twice (1964-7, 1972-4). Distinguished psychologists and sociologists from all over the world visited the research group he set up at Oxford. He received honorary doctorates from the universities of Oxford (1979), Adelaide and Brussels (1982) and an honorary fellowship of the British Psychological Society (1992). In 1990 The International Society of the Study of Personal Relationships in 1990 gave him a distinguished career contribution award.\n\nAfter his retirement, he became Professor Emeritus at Oxford Brookes University. He regularly attended social psychology conferences. He had a great passion for Scottish country dancing.\n\nHis wife Sonia died in 1999 and Argyle died on 6 September 2002, at the age of 77, of injuries suffered in a swimming accident, from which he never fully recovered.\n\nSome of Argyle's best-known contributions were to this field. He was especially interested in gaze. One of his best-known books relevant to this field, The Psychology of Interpersonal Behaviour, became a best-seller. Argyle made contributions to many fields in psychology, including:\n\nArgyle made modifications in 1972 to the communication cycle initially developed by Charles Berner in 1965. The communication cycle involves six steps: someone decides to communicate an idea, encodes it, and sends it; someone else receives it, decodes it and understands it. Feedback demonstrates understanding (e.g. an action is performed or a reply message is encoded and sent). The model allows for the possibility of distortion at either the encoding or decoding stage.\n\nArgyle, a committed Christian, published empirical works on the psychology of religion. His early work in this field was summarized in his book Religious Behaviour (1958). He also collaborated with Benjman Beit-Hallahmi to produce a later book, \"The Psychology of Religious Beliefs, Behaviour and Experience\" (1997). Both books show Argyle's commitment to empiricism in psychology, and list results of surveys into topics such as beliefs in the afterlife or frequencies of religious experience in the general population.\n\nOne of Argyle's most notable later contributions was to the psychology of happiness. Keen that more research should be done in this field, he published \"The Psychology of Happiness\" in 1987, 2nd edition 2001. In this book he listed and discussed empirical findings on happiness, including that happiness is indeed promoted by relationships, faith, sex, eating, exercise, music, success, etc., but probably not by wealth.\n\nAlthough social class is a concept largely studied by sociologists, Argyle's later work showed increasing interest in promotion of socio-psychological perspective on social class. Differences in religious involvement across social class and patterns of social relationship across social class are areas of interest to social psychologists here, and these fields show Argyle was keen to link this area to other areas which he had studied.\n\n\nplus numerous edited books, chapters, and articles in learned journals\n\n"}

Under the Rhodesian administration, it was officially named the Umniati, but its spelling was changed in 1983 to more closely resemble the correct Shona pronunciation.\n\nThe river rises in Mashonaland East, just north of Chivhu, and approximately south of Harare. It runs approximately north-west and for much of its length it originally formed the southern border of Mashonaland province, and today is largely the southern border of Mashonaland West. The river is joined by the Mupfure River (also known as the Umfuli). Below this point, the river is often referred to as the Sanyati. After a total of the river flows into Lake Kariba (the section of the Zambezi between the Kariba Dam and the Batoka Gorge), making it part of the Zambezi Basin.\n\nThe river flow is highly variable, reflecting the sharp distinction in the local climate between dry and wet seasons. Between December and May it flows strongly and is about deep on the plateau, and in breadth (although less deep) on its lower reaches. During the rest of the year, it is much reduced and slower-flowing, usually only deep, and almost drying up on rare occasions during serious droughts; as last in 1984.\n\nThe biggest drop on the river is at Gandavaroyi Falls (Ganderowe Falls). As in Shona, \"ganda\" means \"to throw\", and \"varoyi\" means \"witches\", \"with typical poetry and precision, the Local people have named the cataract after the picturesque practice they had of throwing reputed witches over the waterfall.\"\n\n\n"}

She was married to writer and director Barry Levinson from 1975–1982.\n\nCurtin began her writing career in the 1970s working on episodes of the television sitcom \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\". Curtin and her then-husband Barry Levinson were nominated for an Academy Award (in the category of Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen) for \"...And Justice for All\" (1979) starring Al Pacino. They also co-wrote the semiautobiographical \"Best Friends\" (1982), which starred Burt Reynolds and Goldie Hawn.\n\nCurtin's acting career has run concurrently with her writing career. During the 1970s, she made various guest appearances on television in shows such as \"Happy Days\", \"Welcome Back, Kotter\", \"Rhoda\", \"The Rockford Files\", and \"Barney Miller\".

It is based in the North East of England but distributes worldwide. It was founded in 1966 by climbers and mountaineers Peter Lockey and Gordon Davison, initially as an importer and distributor of outdoors products. Lockey and Davison's outdoor store in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK, went by the name of the LD Mountain Centre. In 1972 they began designing and manufacturing their own products for sale in their shop. They gave their brand the German name 'Berghaus' which translates as 'mountain house'.\n\nBerghaus offers a range of men's, women's and children's outdoor clothing and equipment, including waterproof jackets, fleeces, baselayers and legwear. They also produce a selection of outdoor specific accessories and footwear.\n\n\"It all began when climbers and mountaineers Peter Lockey and Gordon Davison from the North East of England, frustrated by what they saw as a lack of decent outdoor gear, decided to import and sell their own.\n\nTheir specialist outdoor store in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, went by the name of the LD Mountain Centre and quickly gained a reputation for selling the very best in high-performance outdoor products from the likes of \"Atomic Skis\", \"Marker Bindings\" and \"Nordica Ski\".\"\n\nThe first Berghaus rucksacks were launched in 1970 – the \"Berg 172\" and \"Berg 272\" models had external frames and basic single compartments. These more traditional sacks were followed two years later in 1972 by the \"Cyclops\" rucksack – arguably the world’s first rucksack with an internal frame.\n\nIn 1977 Berghaus became one of Europe's pioneer users of Gore-Tex® fabric, a new waterproof and breathable fabric.\n\nThis was followed in 1979 by the development of the \"Yeti Gaiter\", whose distinctive rubber rands were initially made from old tractor inner tubes.\n\nIn the 1980s the \"Gemini\" jacket was introduced, and is still in production today; it allowed a walking jacket to have a zip-in fleece.\n\nIt was also in the early 1980s that mountaineer Sir Chris Bonington, 'officially' wore Berghaus. It was also around this time that Alan Hinkes – who would go on to become the UK's most successful extreme altitude mountaineer – began working with the company.\n\nIn 1986 the Extrem range was launched and included the \"Trango Jacket\". The \"Attak\" sole unit was introduced the following year and exported around the world. Berghaus were awarded the Queen's Award for Export in 1988 and the Northern Business Award for Exporter of the Year.\n\n1993 saw a significant development in Berghaus' history as Pentland Group PLC, home to sports brands Speedo and Ellesse, acquired Berghaus. The early 1990s also saw Berghaus turn its attention to footwear, launching its very first footwear collection. The collection included the \"Storm\" boot, a three-season fabric hiking boot.\n\nAs a new century approached Berghaus introduced the \"Simplex\" concept in 1997: the idea was that by minimising the layers of fabric in a garment and getting rid of any unnecessary styling you achieve a more breathable, lightweight product.\n\n1999 saw the introduction of new lightweight and packable outerwear available at the time – \"Gore-Tex PacLite\", a waterproof, windproof and breathable range of clothing.\n\nThe \"Nitro\" rucksack, introduced by Berghaus in 1998, was awarded the Millennium Product Award by the Design Council of Great Britain.\n\nIn 2011 Berghaus unveiled its new design and development team, \"MtnHaus\", to the world.\n\nThe \"MtnHaus\" team works with Berghaus-sponsored athletes, such as Leo Houlding and Mick Fowler, to produce kit for specific challenges, which means extended design, development and testing periods. So far the \"MtnHaus\" team have produced five products including the \"Asgard Smock\", which went through 18 prototypes before the design was finalised. In 2013, the team developed the award-winning \"Vapour Storm Jacket\".\n\nBerghaus now have a team of over 21 athletes from all over the globe, including:\n\n\nBerghaus now also has several stores throughout the UK, including Bristol, Manchester, Covent Garden in London, Dalton Park in County Durham, Bridgend and Gretna.\n\n"}

A few weeks after his birth, his father gave up flying and the family moved to his mother's hometown of Cascade, Idaho where his father could open an oil and gas wholesale business and he could grow up.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Crutcher attended Eastern Washington State College (now Eastern Washington University) where he swam competitively and earned a BA in psychology and sociology. With no post-graduation plans or prospects, he went back to Eastern and got a teaching certificate.\n\nCrutcher taught at several primary and secondary schools in California and Washington before beginning his writing career. After his first book was completed, he joined Spokane's Child Protection Team and began practicing as a child and family therapist.\n\nCrutcher's debut novel was \"Running Loose\" in 1983 about a senior in high school who has it all until life throws him for a few loops. Many of his novels concern teenaged athletes who have personal problems. Most of his protagonists are male, teenage athletes, often swimmers, and recurring supporting characters include a wise Asian-American teacher or coach and a caring journalism teacher.\n\nChris Crutcher's writing is controversial, and has been frequently challenged and even banned by individuals who want to censor his books by removing them from libraries and classrooms. \"\" and \"Running Loose\" were #63 and #92 on the ALA list of 100 books most frequently challenged during the 1990s. His books generally feature teens coping with serious problems, including abusive parents, racial and religious prejudice, mental and physical disability, and poverty; these themes are viewed by some as too mature for children. Other cited reasons for censorship include strong language and depictions of homosexuality. Despite this controversy, Crutcher's writing has received many awards.\n\nCrutcher has also written an autobiography called \"King of the Mild Frontier\" (2003), an adult novel titled \"The Deep End\" (1991), and two collections of short stories, \"\" (1991) and \"Angry Management\" (2009), some of which further explore characters from his previous novels.

{"id": "2233745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233745", "title": "Blood II: The Chosen", "text": "Blood II: The Chosen\n\nBlood II: The Chosen is a first-person shooter computer game developed by Monolith Productions and distributed by GT Interactive. Unlike the first installment, \"Blood\", which was set in 1928, it takes place in the year 2028, so in addition to conventional weapons and magical items also incorporates science-fiction technology, mostly falling under the cyberpunk genre, and elements of dystopian fiction. Much like its predecessor, the game contains a significant amount of graphic violence and black humor.\n\nIn single player mode the player can choose their character from among the four Chosen. \"Blood II\"'s gameplay is influenced by the choice of character at the start of the game because every Chosen has different marksmanship abilities, amount of maximum hit point and armor level.\n\nThe game is divided into chapters, each of which accessible once the previous one is completed. A total of 17 weapons (some of them usable in dual mode) are available to the player, although he has only 10 positions at his disposal and thus must choose which weapons will be included in his arsenal. Most weapons also have a secondary fire mode, for example one that deals higher damage to hostile creatures but consumes more ammunition. Several power ups including invulnerability, stealth movement or increased firepower gives the player an advantage over enemies for a limited period of time.\n\n\"Blood II\" is primarily focused on the single player experience, but also features a multiplayer mode. Instead of Deathmatch mode, authors decided to change the name to \"Bloodbath\" because it better reflects the game's title. Each player can choose one of the four Chosen to control during the match - Caleb, Gabriella, Ishmael and Ophelia. Since every character has different abilities, the weaponry they receive at the beginning of the game varies. Players can also customize their characters, giving a score from 1 to 5 to four different stats.\n\nThe game takes place in 2028. Caleb, the protagonist, has spent the last century since \"Blood\" searching for a way to resurrect his comrades, The Chosen, who were killed in the previous game by the Cabal, a cult dedicated to the worship of the evil god, Tchernobog. The Cabal, in the meantime, has spent the century since Tchernobog's death by Caleb's hands turning the cult into a global mega-corporation called CabalCo, which uses its economic influence to control the world's populace. This is all thanks to Gideon, the Cabal's current leader who has been raised to restore Tchernobog and destroy Caleb, now called the “Great Betrayer”.\n\nThe game begins with Caleb riding a CabalCo subway train, where he discovers that Gideon is the one driving, after Gideon orders his troops to attack. Ready for a fight, Caleb pursues him through the train, which Gideon rigs to crash before escaping. After he regains consciousness, Caleb continues to chase Gideon through the city of New Town, leading to a few short encounters. He later catches up to Gideon in a CabalCo-owned museum, but before they fight, Gideon's bodyguard fires an experimental weapon creating a dimensional rift. Failing to harm Caleb, it instead brings back Gabriella, one of The Chosen, prompting Gideon and his companions to retreat.\n\nFrom this point on, Caleb begins encountering strange creatures and people infested with strange mind-controlling parasites as he continues to hunt Gideon; fighting through CabalCo housing, steam tunnels, disease laboratories, and an air ship, before heading off to a Cabal controlled cathedral. Gideon is nowhere to be found and he is instead met with a giant of the creatures called the Naga, which Caleb defeats. Gabriella comes up from nearby subway tracks and probes Caleb about the creatures; Caleb has no good answer, and Gabriella expresses her doubts over Caleb's ability to handle this problem. Caleb tersely reassures her, and runs off to catch a train, which again crashes.\n\nCaleb returns to his goal of killing Gideon, ignoring the creature problem, other than killing any encountered. After cornering Gideon in a CabalCo safe house, he is unexpectedly joined by Ishmael, another of The Chosen, after Gideon's bodyguard uses his weapon again. Gideon and his companions again escape, this time in a helicopter. After talking with Ishmael, Caleb fights his way through many CabalCo-owned institutions such as sewage and meat treatment plants and dams, as well as fighting through the subway system many times trying to get to the old underground.\n\nOnce there, he fights off a beast called a Behemoth and meets Ishmael again. During both encounters, Ishmael explains that the creatures are the inhabitants of an invading parallel universe, entering that world through tears in reality left by the death of Tchernobog, who maintained the walls separating realities, which have finally broken down due to the Cabal's experiments. Only Caleb can stop the invasion from consuming our world, as he inherited Tchernobog's power after killing the dark god. Caleb shrugs off Ishmael's concerns, not accepting his powers, and returns to hunting Gideon.\n\nJust before he leaves, Ishmael explains the whereabouts of Ophelia – the final Chosen and Caleb's lover; she is at CabalCo headquarters in Gideon's temple, the epicentre of the rifts. Caleb proceeds there, and, after dealing with several Cabal-created obstructions such as a raised bridge, finds Ophelia. Gideon returns and carries Ophelia away before Caleb can rescue her. Angered, Caleb blasts his way through CabalCo's offices, electrical generation areas, CabalCo's R&D lab, and finally finds Gideon on the rooftops. After Caleb defeats Gideon, with Ophelia freed, Gideon retreats through a dimensional rift. Against Ophelia's advice, Caleb follows him through.\n\nCaleb finds Gideon in an ancient temple, part of a large strange citadel, and faces his spider version. With Gideon dead, Caleb fights many of the otherworldly beings until he encounters three undead forms of his comrades. They introduce themselves as The Ancient One, the leader of the invasion. After clumsily explaining their plans, Caleb faces them, before falling and finding the being's true form. After defeating the squid-like creature, the real Chosen appear. Grudgingly, Caleb gives in to their wishes and re-binds the realities, and the four Chosen begin their long walk home.\n\n\"The Nightmare Levels\", released in August 1999, was an expansion pack for \"Blood II\" that provided background information on Caleb, Gabriella, Ishmael, and Ophelia, narrated by a deceased Gideon. As the Chosen continue to walk home to their world from the invading reality, they encounter a psychic beast known as the Nightmare that captures Caleb due to the Chosen attracting it by telling scary stories.\n\nThe player then has to relive some of the most horrific moments of the Chosen's lives - Caleb fighting the Cabal in the frozen north (\"Blood\", ), the Cabal attack on Ophelia's sorority which led her to join, Ishmael's escape from his life as a circus freak into the Cabal, and Gabriella's spooky night in a haunted house.\n\nCaleb pops in at the end of each of the other Chosen's stories, and tries to figure out what is going on. After Gabriella's nightmare, he is transported to a level resembling the old west, which he escapes back out into the otherworld. There he finds the Nightmare, surmises that it is the being responsible for his troubles, and slays it. Gideon finishes with an end narration, foretelling the Chosen's many adventures and conquests ahead of them.\n\n\"The Nightmare Levels\" reintroduced the Robed Cultist enemies from the original game, added the Gremlins enemies and the Nightmare boss, CabalCo cultists re-skinned as killer clown guards, and two new weapons - the combat shotgun and the flayer. The game also added new multiplayer (BloodBath) models (CabalCo cultists, Soul Drudges, etc.) and modes (such as \"Zombie Head Soccer\").\n\n\"Blood II: The Chosen\" was developed by Monolith Productions and featured Monolith's new fully 3D engine LithTech, which was previously used in \"\". The game was released on November 25, 1998 by GT Interactive, which was later purchased by Infogrames. An official expansion pack was released in August 1999 under the title of Blood II: The Chosen - The Nightmare Levels. As with \"Blood\", a guide book was released for the game entitled \"Blood II: The Chosen Strategy Guide\" by Jamie Madigan.\n\nWork on porting it and LithTech in general to Linux, and then later potentially to other systems like Solaris, was being done by employee Jeremy Blackman, but was never completed.\n\nAround 1999, the source code was partly released to allow easier modding. On April 29, 2010 \"Blood II\" was re-released by the digital distributor gog.com.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \"In the end, \"Blood 2\" seems like the \"Sybil\" of video games; it mimics a lot of different shooter genres, but it has no personality of its own.\"\n\nMark Asher of CNET Gamecenter reported \"disappointing\" sales for \"Blood II\" in the United States during 1998's Christmas shopping season, a problem it shared with competitors \"SiN\" and \"\". Noting that the \"only FPS game that has done really well [over the period] is \"Half-Life\"\", he speculated that first-person shooters' market size was smaller than commonly believed. In April 1999, Asher wrote that the game \"went nowhere at the retail level, although I’ve heard that Monolith has done well with OEM deals.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2233746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233746", "title": "Kevin Spencer (TV series)", "text": "Kevin Spencer (TV series)\n\nKevin Spencer is an animated television series developed by Greg Lawrence, it aired in Canada on The Comedy Network in 1998 and in the United States on Spike TV in 2003. It's aimed at adult audiences. It takes its name from the main character. The half-hour show takes place in Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nThis is based on the flash cartoon of the same name that premiered on Mondo Media's flash cartoon site in the late nineties.\n\nThe show revolves around the everyday happenings of the Spencer family. Kevin himself is a 14-year-old, chain-smoking, alcoholic, cough syrup-addicted, sociopathic juvenile delinquent. He lives with his parents, whom he often shows ambivalence towards, and is a student at a local high school, although he rarely attends school. It is demonstrated multiple times throughout the series that Kevin is mentally unstable, as he is prone to random outbursts of violence, even towards himself, shows signs of insanity, and has a complete disregard for life, including his own. It is also shown that Kevin is probably mentally challenged, as he often has difficulties with performing the simplest of tasks, such as making himself a bowl of cereal, forgetting what he was talking about the instant after saying something, or even realizing that he was hungry, yet at times throughout the series makes very well-articulated statements about certain aspects of society, culture, politics, and education, possibly indicating Kevin is a savant. Throughout the series, Kevin almost never speaks, aside from during dream sequences and occasional one-sentenced outbursts. Instead, the show's narrator (voiced by Lawrence) speaks for Kevin; that is, he describes what Kevin is saying, thinking, and how Kevin reacts to the world around him.\n\nHis parents, Anastasia (voiced by Thomasin Langlands) and Percy (voiced by Lawrence), are also alcoholic, cough syrup-addicted chain-smokers. Both are crude, overweight, unattractive and extraordinarily stupid people who live off of welfare. Both parents neglect or otherwise use Kevin for their own selfish gains, and both show clear signs of sociopathic tendencies. Neither parent is faithful to the other, and Anastasia in particular is highly promiscuous. Their antics usually involve attempting to gain money or alcohol through illegal acts, which quite randomly succeed or fail. While both parents primarily show hatred and disgust towards one another, both occasionally demonstrate a small degree of love (or at least lust) for each other, though these moments rarely last longer than a scene of an episode.\n\nAnother frequent character in the show is Kevin's imaginary friend, Allen the Magic Goose (voiced by Mike Wetmore). Allen often encourages Kevin's sociopathic nature, usually asking him to do illegal, indecent, and/or dangerous things simply for the sake of the thrill or for vengeance. However, Kevin, being a sociopath, often shows ambivalence towards Allen, sometimes threatening or intimidating the bird. During such times, Allen often reminds Kevin of the futility of these outbursts, since Kevin is simply imagining Allen's existence.\n\nMost of the adventures on the show involve illegal actions and antics of the Spencer family. Their motives for these actions range from attempting to acquire more money, alcohol, drugs, or merely for the sake of having something to do. Oftentimes, the show will shift between Kevin's antics and his parents', as well as follow some subplots of other minor characters that tie into the Spencers' schemes and adventures.\n\nEpisode 8 of season 1 was only aired once before it was banned from TV, due to excessive violence and disgusting humor.\n\nOcnus Productions (creators of Kevin Spencer) sold the rights to the series around May/June 2011 to Netflix. The seasons were therefore removed from Expressmedia.ca where Manufacture-On-Demand DVDs had been available for sale for several years. All 8 seasons were made available in the US on Netflix's streaming service July 15, 2011, although as of December 2011 the show failed to appear on Netflix's Canadian version of the streaming service. On July 17, 2012, Netflix stopped featuring it altogether. Seasons 1 and 2 were later added on to Hulu the same year. The series is currently available in Canada on Amazon Prime Video. As of April 2020, all 8 seasons are available on the Tubi app.\n\n"}

He attended the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute and Virginia Tech.\n\nFreeman played college football at Virginia Tech, where he caught 93 passes for 1,534 yards and 16 touchdowns in three seasons. He also returned 63 punts for 651 yards and another touchdown, and rushed for 37 yards. His accomplishments earned him enshrinement in the Virginia Tech Sports Hall of Fame. \n\n\nFreeman was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the 1995 NFL Draft. In his rookie season, he returned a punt 76 yds for a touchdown during a playoff win over Atlanta. He went on to lead the Packers in receiving in four seasons from 1996–1999, and led the NFL in receiving in 1998.\n\nThe peak of Freeman's career occurred during his first tenure with the Green Bay Packers including a victory in Super Bowl XXXI in 1997 over the New England Patriots. During that Super Bowl Freeman caught a Super Bowl record-length touchdown pass of 81 yards from Brett Favre, since eclipsed. That play would give the Packers the lead for good as they went on to win 35–21. Freeman finished the game with three receptions for 105 yards. The following year, Freeman gained over 1,200 receiving yards as Green Bay advanced to their second consecutive Super Bowl, where he caught 9 passes for 126 yards and 2 touchdowns in the 31–24 loss to the Denver Broncos. His 230 all-purpose yards in the game was the third highest total in Super Bowl history\n\nIn 1998, Freeman had his best NFL season, catching 84 passes for a league leading 1,424 receiving yards and earning the right to his only Pro Bowl appearance.\n\nDuring overtime of a Monday night game on November 6, 2000 despite bad weather conditions, Freeman caught what initially appeared to be an incomplete pass while lying on his back—after almost being intercepted by Minnesota Vikings cornerback Cris Dishman, the ball actually bounced off multiple parts of Freeman's body without hitting the ground. Untouched by the defender, Freeman jumped to his feet and ran the ball in for the winning touchdown over the Vikings, the Packers' rival. The touchdown prompted ABC play-by-play announcer Al Michaels, who was obviously stunned by the play, to famously shout, \"He did WHAT?!\" In 2005, ESPN labeled the catch as the greatest play in the history of \"Monday Night Football\". Freeman has said it was the second best catch of his career (claiming his best to be an 81-yard touchdown reception in Super Bowl XXXI).\n\nFreeman played for the Green Bay Packers from 1995 through the 2001 NFL season. After feuding with Packers Head Coach Mike Sherman in 2001, Freeman signed with the Philadelphia Eagles. His final game in his first Packers tenure was against the St. Louis Rams during the 2001 NFL playoffs. He then went on to play a year for the Eagles in 2002 before coming back to Green Bay for the 2003 season and a second tenure with the club. His final catch with the Packers occurred on the road in December 2003 during the fourth quarter of Brett Favre's phenomenal performance against the Oakland Raiders on ABC's Monday Night Football, following the death of Favre's father. He played his final game with Green Bay in the infamous \"4th and 26\" debacle in the NFL playoffs against the Philadelphia Eagles in January 2004. Freeman last played in the NFL with the Miami Dolphins during 2004 training camp.\n\nIn his ten NFL seasons, Freeman caught 477 passes for 7,251 yards, gained 1,007 yards returning kickoffs and punts, and scored 61 touchdowns. He played in the Pro Bowl in 1999. His teams made the playoffs in seven of his NFL seasons. He appeared in four NFC Championship Games and two Super Bowls. He ranks sixth all-time on the Green Bay Packers receivers list with 6,651 yards on 431 catches. Freeman had three 1,000 yard receiving seasons in his career, 1997-1999. Nicknamed \"Free\", in 2006 Freeman won a Pop Warner Award for his work with youth.\n\nOn June 16, 2007, Freeman signed with the Packers to retire with the team.\n\nFreeman occasionally participates as an analyst on ESPN First Take and NFL Live, mostly during NFL season. He has also appeared on ESPN College Gameday in support of his alma mater Virginia Tech. Freeman now appears on Redskins Kickoff and Redskins Postgame Live as a commentator on Comcast SportsNet Washington. Freeman was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\nAntonio Freeman has hosted his own radio show 'The End Zone with Antonio Freeman' since 2010, the show currently airs on WTSO in Madison and WOKY in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nReceiving statistics \nReturning statistics\n\n"}

Its best-known products have been Tootsie Rolls and Tootsie Pops. Tootsie Roll Industries currently markets its brands internationally in Canada, Mexico, and over 75 other countries.\n\nIn 1896, Leo Hirshfield, an Austrian Jewish immigrant to the United States, began work at a small candy shop located in New York City owned by the Stern & Staalberg firm. In 1907, Hirshfield decided he wanted a chocolate-tasting candy that would not melt in the heat, and that would be an economical artificial alternative to traditional chocolates. He named the candy after the nickname of his daughter, Clara \"Tootsie\" Hirshfield. By this point, the company had expanded to a five-story factory. In 1917, the name of the company was changed to The Sweets Company of America. The business, which had forced Hirshfield out by this point (leading to his eventual suicide), became a listed company in 1922. In 1931, the Tootsie Pop — a hard-candy lollipop with Tootsie Roll filling — was invented, and quickly became popular with Dust Bowl refugees during the Depression era because of its low price. During World War II, Tootsie Rolls became a standard part of American soldiers' field rations, due to the hardiness of the candy under a variety of environmental conditions.\n\nIn 1935, the company was in serious difficulty. Its principal supplier of paper boxes, Joseph Rubin & Sons of Brooklyn — concerned about the possible loss of an important customer — became interested in the possibility of acquiring control. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but Bernard D. Rubin acquired a list of shareholders and approached them in person in order to purchase their shares. The Rubins eventually achieved control and agreed that Bernard would run the company as president. Mr. Rubin was able to steadily increase sales and restore profits, changing the formula of the Tootsie Roll and increasing its size, moving from Manhattan to a much larger plant in Hoboken, New Jersey, and guiding the company successfully through the difficult war years when vital raw materials were in short supply. When he died in 1948, he had increased the sales volume twelvefold. After his death, his brother William B. Rubin became president and remained president until 1962.\n\nIn 1962, William's daughter, Ellen Rubin Gordon, took control, and as of January 2015, is Chairman and CEO of the company. For many years prior to his death, her husband, Melvin Gordon, was Chairman and CEO from 1962 to 2015.\n\nIn 1966, the company adopted its current name of \"Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc.\"\n\nThe company has acquired several famous brands of confections such as The Candy Corporation of America's Mason Division (1972), Cella's Confections (1985), The Charms Company (1988), Warner-Lambert's candy division (1993; excluding gum and mints), Andes Candies (2000), and Concord Confections (2004).\n\nThe company's headquarters is located on the South side of Chicago, in a portion of the former Dodge Chicago Plant which produces the majority of its candy. The company also has a factory in Mexico City where it produces some flavors of Tootsie Pops and other candy products for the Mexican market as well as for export to the U.S. and Canada. There is also a candy factory in the Area 4 neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts (belonging to the subsidiary \"Cambridge Brands\", formerly home to its predecessor, the James O. Welch Company).\n\nTootsie Roll brands and products include:\n\n"}

{"id": "2233777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233777", "title": "Hospital corpsman", "text": "Hospital corpsman\n\nA hospital corpsman (HM [or corpsman]) is an enlisted medical specialist of the United States Navy, who may also serve in a U.S. Marine Corps unit. The corresponding rating within the United States Coast Guard is health services technician (HS).\n\nHospital corpsmen work in a wide variety of capacities and locations, including shore establishments such as naval hospitals and clinics, aboard ships, and as the primary medical caregivers for sailors while underway. Hospital corpsmen are frequently the only medical care-giver available in many fleet or Marine units on extended deployment. In addition, hospital corpsmen perform duties as assistants in the prevention and treatment of disease and injury and assist health care professionals in providing medical care to sailors and their families.\n\nThey may function as clinical or specialty technicians, medical administrative personnel and health care providers at medical treatment facilities. They also serve as battlefield corpsmen with the Marine Corps, rendering emergency medical treatment to include initial treatment in a combat environment. Qualified hospital corpsmen may be assigned the responsibility of independent duty aboard ships and submarines; Fleet Marine Force, SEAL and seabee units, and at isolated duty stations where no medical officer is available.\n\nHospital corpsmen were previously trained at Naval Hospital Corps School, Great Lakes, Illinois, and the U.S. Naval Hospital Corps School San Diego, California, until the 2011 Base Realignment and Closure Bill caused Hospital Corps School to be relocated to the Medical Education and Training Campus (METC) at Joint Base San Antonio, Texas. Naval Hospital Corps School was also located at NRMC Balboa in San Diego, California.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, many of the 16-week Naval Hospital Corps school graduates went directly to 8404 Field Medical Service School (FMSS) at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, or Camp Pendleton, California, for nine weeks of field training, before deployment to a Marine Corps unit in South Vietnam.\n\nThe colloquial form of address for a hospital corpsman is \"Doc\". In the United States Marine Corps, this term is generally used as a sign of respect.\n\nPrior to the establishment of the hospital corps, enlisted medical support in the U.S. Navy was limited in scope. In the Continental Navy and the early U.S. Navy, medical assistants were assigned at random out of the ship's company. Their primary duties were to keep the irons hot and buckets of sand at the ready for the operating area. It was commonplace during battle for the surgeons to conduct amputations and irons were used to close lacerations and wounds. Sand was used to keep the surgeon from slipping on the bloody ship deck. Previously, corpsmen were commonly referred to as loblolly boys, a term borrowed from the Royal Navy, and a reference to the daily ration of porridge fed to the sick. The nickname was in common use for so many years that it was finally officially recognized by the Navy Regulations of 1814. In coming decades, the title of the enlisted medical assistant would change several times—from loblolly boy, to nurse (1861), and finally to bayman (1876). A senior enlisted medical rating, surgeon's steward, was introduced in 1841 and remained through the civil war. Following the war, the title surgeon's steward was abolished in favor of apothecary, a position requiring completion of a course in pharmacy.\n\nStill, there existed pressure to reform the enlisted component of the Navy's medical department—medicine as a science was advancing rapidly, foreign navies had begun training medically skilled sailors, and the U.S. Army had established an enlisted hospital corps in 1887. Navy Surgeon General J.R. Tryon and subordinate physicians lobbied the Navy administration to take action. With the Spanish–American War looming, Congress passed a bill authorizing establishment of the U.S. Navy Hospital Corps, signed into law by President William McKinley on 17 June 1898. Three ratings were created therein—hospital apprentice, hospital apprentice first class (a petty officer third class), and hospital steward, which was a chief petty officer.\n\nA revision in 1916 established a new rate structure. With the introduction of a second junior rate there were now hospital apprentice second class (HA2c) and hospital apprentice first class (HA1c). The rating title for petty officers was established as pharmacist's mate (PhM), following the pattern of some of the Navy's other ratings (boatswain's mate, gunner's mate, etc.). Pharmacist's mate third class (PhM3c), second class (PhM2c), and first class (PhM1c) were now the petty officers, and chief pharmacist's mate (CPhM) was the chief petty officer. This structure remained in place until 1947.\n\nA total of 684 personal awards were awarded to hospital corpsmen, including 22 Medals of Honor, 55 Navy Crosses, and 237 Silver Stars. During World War I, hospital corpsmen served throughout the fleet, earning particular distinction on the Western Front with the Marine Corps.\n\nIn the United States Navy in World War II, hospital corpsmen assigned to Marine units made beach assaults with the marines in every battle in the Pacific. Corpsmen also served on thousands of ships and submarines. Three unassisted emergency appendectomies were performed by hospital corpsmen serving undersea and beyond hope of medical evacuation. The hospital corps has the distinction of being the only corps in the U.S. Navy to be commended, in a famous speech by Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal after the conclusion of the war.\n\nHospital corpsmen continued to serve at sea and ashore, and accompanied marines and Marine units into battle during the Korean and Vietnam wars. Fifteen hospital corpsmen were counted among the dead following the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983. Hospital corpsmen also served in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars providing corpsmen for convoys, patrols, and hospital or clinic treatment.\n\nWhether they are assigned to hospital ships, reservist installations, recruiter offices, or Marine Corps combat units, the rating of hospital corpsman is the most decorated in the United States Navy and one of the most decorated corps in the US military, with 22 Medals of Honor, 179 Navy Crosses since World War I, 31 Navy Distinguished Service Medals, 959 Silver Stars, and more than 1,600 Bronze Star Medal's with combat V's for heroism, since World War II. Twenty naval ships have been named after hospital corpsmen. Prior to selection to the command master chief program, the 11th MCPON, Joe R. Campa, was a hospital corpsman.\n\nOn September 29, 2016, the Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus terminated the corpsman rating along with all other U.S. Navy enlisted ratings. However, in late December 2016, the usage of ratings were restored by the Navy after much backlash by many of the enlisted naval ranks.\n\nAs of April 2011, training to become a hospital corpsman began at Basic Medical Technician Corpsman Program (BMTCP) located at Joint Base Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nBecause of the need for hospital corpsmen in a vast array of foreign, domestic, and shipboard duty stations, as well as with United States Marine Corps units, the hospital corps is the largest occupational rating (Navy Enlisted Classification-HM) in the United States Navy, with about 25,000 members active duty and reserve. \n\nThe basic training for hospital corpsmen is conducted at the Medical Education and Training Campus, located in Texas at a joint military base. Originally one of the Navy's \"A\" schools (primary rating training). Upon graduation, the hospital corpsman is given the Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) code of HM-0000, or \"quad-zero\" in common usage. Students go through a 14-week course that provides in-depth and extensive training into the application of emergency medical techniques, disease and pathologies, and nursing techniques.\n\nNECs are not as analogous to MOS in the United States Army and Marine Corps, or AFSC in the Air Force as the rating in the Navy. There are primary NECs, and secondary NECs. For example, a hospital corpsman who completes Field Medical Training Battalion (FMTB) and earns the NEC HM-8404, moves that NEC to primary and has a secondary NEC of HM-0000. If that hospital corpsman attends a \"C\" School, then the NEC earned at the \"C\" School becomes their primary and HM-8404 becomes the secondary. Some hospital corpsmen go on to receive more specialized training in roles such as medical laboratory technician, optometry technician, radiology technician, aerospace medicine specialist, pharmacy technician, operating room technician, etc. This advanced education is done through \"C\" schools, which confer 39 additional NECs. Additionally, hospital corpsmen (E-5 and above) may attend independent duty corpsman training, qualifying for independent duty in surface ships and submarines, with diving teams, and Fleet Marine Force Recon teams, as well as at remote shore installations. In addition to advanced medical training, these hospital corpsmen receive qualification in sanitation and public health.\n\nOf note is the Field Medical Training Battalion (FMTB), with locations at Camp Del Mar and Camp Johnson, where sailors bound for service with USMC operating forces earn the NEC HM-8404, Field Medical Service Technician. FMTB provides specialized training in advanced emergency medicine and the fundamentals of Marine Corps life, while emphasizing physical conditioning, small arms familiarity, and basic battlefield tactics. , this rigorous training is 8 weeks. Training for the Fleet Marine Force (FMF) familiarizes navy corpsmen with the Marines. A bond and mutual respect is often formed between Marines and their assigned hospital corpsmen, earning respect apart from their Navy shipmates. FMF hospital corpsmen are issued the Marine Corps service uniforms and camouflage uniforms (MARPAT) while assigned to the Marine Corps and also have the option to go Marine Corps Regulations. They are then issued a new seabag containing the Marine uniforms (except dress blues) with uniform matching Navy rate chevrons instead of the Marine rank chevrons, and collar rank insignias, and wear those instead of traditional Navy uniforms. The Navy's new digitized camouflage working uniform are worn by sailors stationed at other naval facilities.\n\nHospital corpsmen can further specialize; they may undergo further training to become Special Amphibious Reconnaissance Corpsmen, or \"SARC\". They are usually found in both the FMF Recon, Marine Division Recon and MARSOC units. They are trained and skilled in combat, including combatant swimming, opened/closed circuit scuba diving, military free-fall and amphibious operations. They act as advisers regarding health and injury prevention, and treat illnesses from decompression sickness as well as other conditions requiring hyperbaric treatment.\nHospital corpsmen who have received the warfare designator of enlisted fleet marine force warfare specialist are highly trained members of the Hospital Corps who specialize in all aspects of working with the United States Marine Corps operating forces. Attainment of this designation is highly prized among all corpsmen. The enlisted fleet marine force warfare designation for hospital corpsmen is the only U.S. Navy warfare device awarded solely by a U.S. Marine Corps general officer. This awarding authority cannot be delegated to U.S. Navy officers. However, obtaining the title of \"FMF\" is a rigorous procedure and not every hospital corpsman who has been with a Marine Corps unit will wear the FMF warfare device. U.S. Navy officers in the medical community (Medical Corps (doctor), Nurse Corps, Dental Corps, Medical Service Corps) can earn and wear the officer equivalent to this insignia. Additionally any sailor attached to a USMC unit can earn and wear an FMF warfare device. (e.g., administrative rates such as logistic specialists) provided they complete all the qualifications for the FMF warfare specialist.\n\nThe first physician assistants were selected from Navy corpsmen who had combat experience in Vietnam. They made up members of the first PA class at Duke University. The Navy trained its own physician assistants drawing from the ranks of qualified petty officer second class corpsman, as well as independent duty hospital corpsmen at the Naval School of Health Sciences in Portsmouth, VA until 1985, then at San Diego, CA and current the Interservice Physician Assistant Program (IPAP) with a university affiliation of the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC). It is conducted in two phases the first phase at the Graduate School and Academy of Health Sciences at AMEDDC&S, Ft. Sam Houston, TX and the second phase at various medical facilities and specialties. When training completed they become officers in the Medical Service Corps (MSC). Former Navy hospital corpsmen are also represented in many medical disciplines, as physicians, nurses, medical administrators and other walks of life. After completing their training, a physician assistant is promoted to the rank of lieutenant junior grade (O-2). Previously after graduating from civilian PA school, they had only been given the rank of warrant officer 2 (CWO2).\n\nEffective 2 April 1948 the Navy changed the names and insignia of the hospital corps. The new titles were Hospitalman Recruit, Hospitalman Apprentice, Hospitalman, Hospital Corpsman Third, Second, and First Class, and Chief Hospital Corpsman. The red Geneva cross, which had marked corpsmen for 50 years, was replaced in the rating badge with the misattributed mark of the winged caduceus. The rates of Senior Chief and Master Chief Hospital Corpsman were added in 1958.\n\nReference: \"Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships\"\n\n\n\n\nPre-World War I\n\nWorld War I\n\nWorld War II\nKorean War\n\nVietnam War\n\nGlobal War on Terror\nDuring World War II, the United States Maritime Service created a Hospital Corps similar to the U.S. Navy's and sent pursers through this hospital corpsman training, to serve in a combined administrative and medical role on civilian tankers, freighters, and oilers. Prior to this, there were no competent trained personnel to perform first aid aboard these vessels. The purser-corpsman was trained in anatomy, physiology, pharmacy, clinical laboratory, hygiene and sanitation, emergency treatment, first aid, and nursing. They were taught how to administer injections, treat compound fractures, administer blood plasma, and suture wounds.\n\nThe Maritime Service’s Hospital Corps School was founded at the Sheepshead Bay Maritime Service Training Station on 7 December 1942. Surgeon S.S. Heilwell (R), United States Uniformed Public Health Service, was placed in charge of training. The course was taught over four months, with a 12-week period of didactic classroom experience and four weeks of practical experience at a Marine hospital. The original class of 331 students resulted in 239 graduates on 12 March 1943, but demand saw an increase in the class to 600 students, to cycle in 50 student classes starting on a weekly basis. Training stations were instructed to provide careful scrutiny by examining boards for all candidates. Pursers on sea duty started arriving at the station on 10 August 1943. By 1 January 1944, there were 600 purser-corpsmen at sea, with 1,324 graduates in the Maritime Service. Selection required an above average mark on the General Classification Test and interest in both administration and health care.\n\n\n"}

In 1976, she appeared in ABC's original pilot to \"Three's Company\" playing the naive blonde, Samantha. She starred alongside John Ritter and Valerie Curtin. A second pilot followed, with Susan Lanier in the role of Samantha, now called Chrissy. Eventually, the role went to Suzanne Somers.\n\nIn 1977, Zenor started playing the role of Margo Anderman Horton on the soap opera \"Days of Our Lives\". Zenor left the role in 1980. She was married to her \"Days\" co-star Edward Mallory until his death in 2007.\n"}

Military versions produce up to of thrust dry; afterburning variants can reach up to . The engine, depending upon additional equipment and specific model, weighs from . It is one of GE's most successful and longest in service military jet engines, with the civilian versions having logged over 16.5 million hours of operation. The United States Air Force plans to continue using the J85 in aircraft through 2040. Civilian models, known as the CJ610, are similar but supplied without an afterburner, while the CF700 adds a rear-mounted fan for improved fuel economy.\n\nThe J85 was originally designed to power a large decoy missile, the McDonnell ADM-20 Quail. The Quail was designed to be released from a B-52 Stratofortress in-flight and fly for long distances in formation with the launch aircraft, multiplying the number of targets facing the SA-2 surface-to-air missile operators on the ground. This mission demanded a small engine that could nevertheless provide enough power to keep up with the jet bomber. Like the similar Armstrong Siddeley Viper being built in England, the engine on a Quail drone had no need to last for extended periods of time, so therefore could be built of low-quality materials.\n\nThe fit was a success on the Quail, but again like the Viper it was later built with normal grade materials and subsequently used to power small jet aircraft, including the Northrop T-38 Talon, Northrop F-5, Canadair CT-114 Tutor, and Cessna A-37 Dragonfly light attack aircraft. More recently, J85s have powered the Scaled Composites White Knight aircraft, the carrier for the Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne spacecraft, and the Me 262 Project.\n\nThe basic engine design is quite small, about in diameter, and long. It features an eight-stage axial-flow compressor powered by two turbine stages, and is capable of generating up to of dry thrust, or more with an afterburner. At full throttle at sea level, this engine, without afterburner, consumes approximately of fuel per hour. At cruise altitude and power, it consumes approximately per hour.\n\nSeveral variants were produced. The J85-21 variant added a stage ahead of the base 8-stage compressor for a total of 9 stages, improving thrust.\n\nMore than 12,000 J85 engines had been built by the time production ended in 1988.\n\nThe Iranian Ministry of Defense constructed a new engine based on the General Electric J85 named \"OWJ\". The engine was presented at a defense exhibition on 22 August 2016. the owj engine has a dry thrust of 3500 lbf.\n\n\n\n\n"}

As most cowboys were young single men, the standard bunkhouse was a large open room with narrow beds or cots for each individual and little privacy. The bunkhouse of the late 19th century was usually heated by a wood stove and personal needs were attended to in an outhouse.\nWhile the modern bunkhouse today is still in existence on some large ranches that are too far away from towns for an easy daily commute, it now has electricity, central heating and modern indoor plumbing.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a bunkhouse provides accommodation with fewer facilities than a larger, staffed youth hostel. Bunkhouses are found in mountainous areas, such as the Scottish Highlands, as well as rural areas in England and Wales, for example at All Stretton. Bunkhouses are very different from hotels: bunkhouses often just offer a basic accommodation with few amenities for passers-by such as hikers.\n\n"}

Kubik, although Bob Whelan, Ken Leistner, and John McCallum are counted as proponents of similar training methods. Historical lifters like Peary Rader and various late 19th-century and early 20th-century strongmen and physical culture proponents such as Eugen Sandow are regarded as being inspiration of dinosaur training styles.\n\nKubik's book \"Dinosaur Training\" became highly acclaimed by the weight-lifting community. It offered simple yet effective routines, which were in stark contrast to complex routines offered by many authors within the fitness industry. Kubiks books are written in a motivational style, with an edge of humour.\n\nFor a time Kubik advocated Dinosaur Training using bodyweight exercises, as described in his book Dinosaur Bodyweight Training (2006), using such exercises as pushups, handstand pushups, pullups, neck bridges, hanging leg raises, and two- and one-legged deep knee bends. In recent years however he has returned to writing about and advocating traditional weightlifting modes of training, using such exercises as squats, deadlifts, powercleans, high pulls, military presses, barbell bentover rows, benchpresses, etc. for low to moderate reps. \n\nKubik elaborated further on the principles of Dinosaur training literally in a novel format in 2008's \"Legacy of Iron,\" which told the story of a young man being tutored in basic \"old school\" training and manhood by the lifters of York Barbell. \n\nThe primary texts describing the Dinosaur Training philosophy are \"Dinosaur Training\" (1996; 2nd edition, 1998), written by Brooks D.

Wolf is widely credited with bringing success to a Packers franchise that had rarely won during the two decades prior to Wolf joining the organization. He also played a significant role in personnel operations with the Oakland and Los Angeles Raiders from 1963 to 1975 and again from 1978 to 1990. He joined Green Bay's front office in November 1991 from a personnel director's job with the New York Jets. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in August 2015.\n\nWolf was born in New Freedom, Pennsylvania on December 30, 1938. After serving three years in the Army, Wolf played college baseball at Maryville College in Tennessee. After college, he worked for \"Pro Football Illustrated\", a Chicago sports newspaper.\n\nWolf became a scout for the Raiders in 1963. With the Raiders, Wolf took part in drafting such notable players as Art Shell, Gene Upshaw, Ken Stabler, and Jack Tatum, all of whom would play for the Super Bowl XI Championship team in 1976, and later such players as Howie Long, Marcus Allen, and Matt Millen, all of the Super Bowl XVIII Championship team in 1983, the then Los Angeles Raiders.\n\nAfter the death of Raiders owner Al Davis, Wolf was rumored to possibly come back to Oakland. He didn't specify that he wanted to have a full-time job as General Manager there, but he told the new ownership team that he would assist them with anything they needed. In an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel he supported Green Bay Packers director of football operations, Reggie McKenzie as a perfect candidate for the GM position in Oakland and called him a \"tremendous evaluator\" when it comes to finding players.\n\nIn 1975, Wolf joined the expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers as vice-president of operations. He helped build the team that would advance to the . He would not be around to see his team develop, however, as he resigned his position with the Buccaneers in February, 1978, citing \"personal matters\". It is believed that he had difficulty working with Buccaneer owner Hugh Culverhouse, and that Culverhouse was trying to interfere with personnel decisions. Wolf later indicated that Culverhouse's close personal relationship with and strong financial stake in coach John McKay meant that Wolf had to be the one to pay with his job for the team's 0-26 start. Wolf returned to the Raiders on the expiration of his Buccaneer contract.\n\nIn 1991, Wolf was hired to replace Packers General Manager Tom Braatz. Wolf's first major decisions were to fire head coach Lindy Infante, hire then-San Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Mike Holmgren to replace him, and to trade for then-Atlanta Falcons backup quarterback Brett Favre. In 1993, Wolf signed the most sought after free-agent available, Reggie White, bringing in a team leader and defensive superstar. This signing, in NFL free agency's first year, also made Green Bay a more desirable destination for future potential free agents, including White's fellow defensive linemen Santana Dotson and Sean Jones. Specifically, White's arrival negated the perception of Green Bay as a city where African-American players did not feel welcome. With White and cast-off Gilbert Brown, Dotson and Jones formed the heart of the Packer defense during the team's championship run.\n\nWolf is credited with remaking the Packers into a perennial winner and championship contender. From 1968 to 1991, the Packers had only four winning seasons. Over his nine-year term as GM, the Packers compiled a 92–52 record, good for a .639 winning percentage, second in the NFL over that span to the San Francisco 49ers. The Packers won Super Bowl XXXI against the New England Patriots, lost in Super Bowl XXXII to the Denver Broncos, and made the playoffs six straight times. Wolf announced he would retire as Packers GM in February 2001. He stayed on through the April NFL draft and officially retired as Packers GM in June 2001. Afterward the Packers head coach at that time, Mike Sherman, assumed his duties as GM.\n\nHis son, Eliot Wolf, served as the Cleveland Browns' assistant general manager position from 2018 to 2019.\n\nOn December 31, 2012, San Diego Chargers President Dean Spanos retained Wolf as a consultant to advise the Chargers throughout the general manager and head coach hiring process.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1991, Wolf served as personnel director for the New York Jets.\n\nOn December 28, 2014, Wolf later joined Charley Casserly as a consultant for the Jets in their search for a new head coach and general manager, following the firing of Rex Ryan and John Idzik Jr..\n\nOn October 22, 2014, Wolf was selected as a finalist to be a member in the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a contributor (designation for individuals who were neither a player nor a coach).\n\nOn January 31, 2015, Wolf was confirmed as a member of the 2015 Hall of Fame class.

To keep the lists manageable, only the largest craters within a time period are included. The complete list is divided into separate articles by geographical region.\n\nThese features were caused by the collision of meteors (consisting of large fragments of asteroids) or comets (consisting of ice, dust particles and rocky fragments) with the Earth. For eroded or buried craters, the stated diameter typically refers to the best available estimate of the original rim diameter, and may not correspond to present surface features. Time units are either in thousands (ka) or millions (Ma) of years.\n\nLess than ten thousand years old, and with a diameter of or more. The EID lists fewer than ten such craters, and the largest in the last 100,000 years (100 ka) is the Rio Cuarto crater in Argentina. However, there is some uncertainty regarding its origins and age, with some sources giving it as < 10 ka while the EID gives a broader < 100 ka.\n\nThe Kaali impacts (c. 2000 BC) during the Nordic Bronze Age may have influenced Estonian and Finnish mythology, the Campo del Cielo (c. 2000 BC) could be in the legends of some Native American tribes, while Henbury (c. 2200 BC) has figured in Australian Aboriginal oral traditions.\n\nFor the Rio Cuarto craters, 2002 research suggests they may actually be aeolian structures. The EID gives a size of about for Campo del Cielo, but other sources quote .\n\nFrom between 10 thousand years to one million years ago, and with a diameter of or more. The largest in the last one million years is the Zhamanshin crater in Kazakhstan and has been described as being capable of producing a nuclear-like winter.\n\nHowever, the currently unknown source of the enormous Australasian strewnfield (c. 780 ka) could be a crater about across.\n\nFrom between 1 and 10 million years ago, and with a diameter of or more. If uncertainties regarding its age are resolved, then the largest in the last 10 million years would be the Karakul crater which is listed in EID with an age of less than five Ma, or the Pliocene. The large but apparently craterless Eltanin impact (2.5 Ma) into the Pacific Ocean has been suggested as contributing to the glaciations and cooling during the Pliocene.\n\nCraters with diameter or more are all older than 10 Ma, except possibly Karakul, , whose age is uncertain.\n\nThere are more than forty craters of such size. The largest two within the last hundred million years have been linked to two extinction events: Chicxulub for the Cretaceous–Paleogene and the Popigai impact for the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event.\n\nThe largest unconfirmed craters or more are significant not only for their size, but also for the possible coeval events associated with them. For example, the Wilkes Land crater has been connected to the massive Permian–Triassic extinction event. The sortable table has been arranged by diameter.\n\n, the Earth Impact Database (EID) contains 190 confirmed craters. The table below is arranged by the continent's percentage of the Earth's land area, and where Asian and Russian craters are grouped together per EID convention. The global distribution of known impact structures apparently shows a surprising asymmetry, with the small but well-funded European continent having a large percentage of confirmed craters. It is suggested this situation is an artifact, highlighting the importance of intensifying research in less studied areas like Antarctica, South America and elsewhere.\n\n\n\n"}

It is in the ancient Campus Martius.\n\nThe name of the square comes from the \"Torre Argentina\", which takes its name from the city of Strasbourg whose Latin name was \"Argentoratum\". In 1503, the Papal Master of Ceremonies Johannes Burckardt, who came from Strasbourg and was known as \"Argentinus\", built in \"via del Sudario\" a palace (now at number 44), called \"Casa del Burcardo\", to which the tower is annexed.\n\nThe other tower in the square is the medieval \"Torre del Papito\" (\"Little Pope's Tower\"), attributed by tradition to Antipope Anacletus II Pierleoni, allegedly not a tall person.\n\nAfter Italian unification, it was decided to reconstruct part of Rome (1909), demolishing the zone of Torre Argentina. However, during the demolition work in 1927, the colossal head and arms of a marble statue were discovered. The archeological investigation brought to light the presence of a \"holy area\", dating to the Republican era, with four temples and part of Pompey's Theatre.\n\nJulius Caesar was killed in the Curia of the Theatre of Pompey, and the spot where he is believed to have been assassinated is in the square.\n\nThe Mayor of Rome, Virginia Raggi, announced in February 2019 that by late 2021 the site will be installed with walkways and the general public will be able to tour the ruins for the first time.\n\nThe four temples, originally designated by the letters \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", and \"D\", front onto a paved street, which was reconstructed in the imperial era, after the fire of AD 80. The area was delineated to the North by the \"Hecatostylum\" (one-hundred columns porch) and the Baths of Agrippa, and to the South by the buildings related to the Circus Flaminius, to the East by the great porched square of \"Porticus Minucia Frumentaria\", and to the West by the Theatre of Pompey.\n\n\"Temple A\" was built in the 3rd century BC, and is probably the \"Temple of Juturna\" built by Gaius Lutatius Catulus after his victory against the Carthaginians in 241 BC. It was later rebuilt as a church, the apse of which is still present.\n\n\"Temple B\", a circular temple \"(tholos)\" with six columns remaining, was built by Quintus Lutatius Catulus in 101 BC in fulfillment of his vow at the Battle of Vercellae. The temple \"(aedes)\" was devoted to \"Fortuna Huiusce Diei\", \"the Fortune of This Day.\" The colossal statue found during excavations and now kept in the Centrale Montemartini of the Capitoline Museums was the statue of the goddess herself. Only the head, the arms, and the legs were made of marble: the other parts, covered by the dress, were of other materials, probably a wooden frame. This is known as an acrolithic statue. \n\n\"Temple C\" is the most ancient of the four, dating back to 4th or 3rd century BC, and was probably devoted to \"Feronia\" the ancient Italic goddess of fertility. After the fire of A.D. 80, this temple was restored, and the white and black mosaic of the inner temple cella dates back to this restoration.\n\"Temple D\" is the largest of the four, dates back to the 2nd century BC with Late Republican restorations, and was devoted to \"Lares Permarini\" (Lares who protect sailors), but only a small part of it has been excavated (a street covers the most of it). It was vowed by the praetor, Lucius Aemilius Regillus, while engaged in a naval battle with the fleet of Antiochus the Great in 190 BC, and dedicated by M. Aemilius Lepidus, when censor, on 22 December, 179. On the doors of the temple was a dedicatory inscription in Saturnian metre. It is recorded as standing \"in porticu Minucia\" and therefore its exact site depends on that of the porticus.\n\nThe Teatro Argentina is an 18th-century opera house and theatre located in the square. The premieres of many notable operas took place there. They include Gioachino Rossini's \"The Barber of Seville\" in 1816 and Giuseppe Verdi's \"I due Foscari\" in 1844 and \"La battaglia di Legnano\" in 1849.\n\nThe Torre Argentina Cat Sanctuary is located in Temple D of the Largo di Torre Argentina. The cat shelter was founded in 1993, and offers sterilization and adoption programs that house an estimated 350 cats. The shelter operates as a no-kill shelter under Law no. 281, enacted by the Italian Parliament in 1991. These laws introduced: (i) the cats’ rights to live free and safe, (ii) institutionalization of cat caretakers. The shelter remains active, despite archaeologists protests to dismantle the shelter in favor of protecting the excavation.\n\n"}
{"id": "2233872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233872", "title": "Cincinnati Cyclones", "text": "Cincinnati Cyclones\n\nThe Cincinnati Cyclones are a professional ice hockey team based in Cincinnati, Ohio. The team is a member of the ECHL. Originally established in 1990, the team first played their games in the Cincinnati Gardens and now play at Heritage Bank Center. The Cyclones are a minor league affiliate of the Buffalo Sabres (National Hockey League) and the Rochester Americans (American Hockey League).\n\nCincinnati has fielded Cyclones teams with three separate franchises in two different leagues: the International Hockey League (1992–2001) and the ECHL (1990–1992, 2001–2004, 2006–present). Together, the franchises have combined to win two Kelly Cups (2008 and 2010), three conference championships (2008, 2010 and 2014), two overall points championships (2008 and 2019), and five division championships (1996, 2008, 2009, 2013 and 2019). In 2007–08, the team had the most successful season in ECHL history with 55 wins, 115 points, and its first conference and league championships.\n\nThere have been three separate franchises known as the Cincinnati Cyclones, two in the ECHL and one in the IHL.\n\nThe first franchise to use the name Cincinnati Cyclones was founded in 1990. The team played their games at the Cincinnati Gardens. They lost in the first round of the playoffs in the 1990–91 season. In the 1991–92 season, the Cyclones lost in the Riley Cup semifinals. The team's owner at the time, Doug Kirchhofer, was granted an International Hockey League franchise and chose to move the Cyclones name to that franchise. He then sold the ECHL franchise to Art Clarkson of Birmingham, Alabama, to form the new Birmingham Bulls.\n\nThe first season in the IHL, Cincinnati failed to qualify for the postseason, which would be the first of only two seasons in which they did not qualify. Paul Lawless, who would eventually be head coach and vice president of player development and have his number retired, began his first of several stints with the team in the 1992–93 season. On April 2, 2004, during his number retirement ceremony, he was singled out as a reason for the team's success, both on the ice and in attendance. During the IHL years, the Cyclones set a team record of eight consecutive 90+ point seasons, ending when the International Hockey League ceased operations in 2001. During the Cyclones nine years in the IHL, they won their only division and conference regular season championships in the 1995–96 season, but lost in a seven-game semifinal series to the Orlando Solar Bears.\n\nIn 1997, the Cyclones' lease agreement with the Cincinnati Gardens came to an end when the two sides were unable to reach an agreement for a new contract. Team owner, Doug Kirchhofer, purchased what then was known as Riverfront Coliseum in downtown Cincinnati, renamed it The Crown and renovated the arena. During the seven seasons the Cyclones were in the arena, the venue was renamed the Firstar Center and now is known as Heritage Bank Center. The team has since been unsuccessful in reclaiming the higher attendance numbers from the Cincinnati Gardens, until the 2008 Kelly Cup, where they drew 12,722 fans to the last game of the postseason.\n\nThe third Cyclones franchise started in the 1995 as the Louisville RiverFrogs in Louisville, Kentucky. After three years, the team moved to Miami as the Miami Matadors. After the lone season in Florida, the franchise eventually came into the ownership of a group in Birmingham, Alabama, and the franchise went into inactive status while ownership looked into locations for their team. Upon the folding of the IHL, the Cyclones name was sold to this ownership group who moved the franchise to Cincinnati to become the new Cyclones.\n\nThe first year back in the ECHL ended the team's streak of 90+ point seasons with the Cyclones finishing just 12 points shy despite a 10-game fewer season length. Former Cyclones player Paul Lawless became head coach, as a mid-season replacement for Ray Edwards.\n\nBefore the start of the 2003–04 season former Cyclones player and assistant coach Chris Cichocki left the Arkansas RiverBlades in order to return as the Cyclones head coach. Despite his success with Arkansas, Cichocki led the team to their worst season with 54 points and failed to make the playoffs for the second time in team history.\n\nShortly after ending the season without a playoff berth, in April 2004, the Cyclones suspended operations. This suspension was mainly due to lack of revenue and safe access to the arena as it was limited by construction in Downtown Cincinnati. This dormancy left Cincinnati hockey to the cross-town, Cincinnati Gardens-based AHL rival, Cincinnati Mighty Ducks and stopped the city's record of two minor league hockey teams in the same city for consecutive years. The Cincinnati Mighty Ducks suspended operations in 2005 after their NHL affiliate, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, switched their affiliation to the Portland Pirates.\n\nWith minor league hockey dormant in Cincinnati for a year, and plans for the proposed AHL Cincinnati RailRaiders franchise scrapped for 2006–07, on April 21, 2006, the Cyclones announced that they would participate in the upcoming 2006–07 ECHL season. They returned to play their home games at U.S. Bank Arena, joining their two ECHL, Ohio rivals, the Dayton Bombers and Toledo Storm. They then obtained an affiliation with the Montreal Canadiens of the NHL and the Hamilton Bulldogs of the AHL. The Cyclones won their first game back in the ECHL on October 20 against the Pensacola Ice Pilots at U.S. Bank Arena with a score of 3 to 1. Head coach Chuck Weber was the runner-up for the ECHL's Coach of the Year award for 2006–07 and was re-signed for the 2007–08 season.\n\nIn addition to the Montreal/Hamilton affiliation, the Cyclones added the NHL's Nashville Predators and the AHL's Milwaukee Admirals as affiliates in 2007. The Cyclones' 2007–08 season saw the club break numerous franchise and league records. Through 50 games, the Cyclones were 31 games over .500. Attendance at games had increased nearly 40% over 2006–07 and the club had already surpassed their win total from 2006–07 (37). They achieved this mark in 24 fewer games. On February 22, 2008, the Cyclones tied the ECHL record for a single-season winning streak of 14 consecutive games, defeating the Johnstown Chiefs 5–2 in Cincinnati. On February 23, 2008, David Desharnais recorded two assists, extending his streak of games with at least one assist to 18, breaking the existing ECHL record of 17. In the same game, the Cyclones set a new ECHL record for a single-season winning streak of 15 consecutive wins when the Cyclones defeated the Elmira Jackals in a 5–4 shootout.\n\nThe team finished the regular season with 115 points, earning them the Brabham Cup regular season championship. Individually, Chuck Weber was named ECHL coach of the year, earning him the John Brophy trophy. David Desharnais claimed three ECHL awards: Most Valuable Player, Rookie of the Year, and the Leading Scorer award with 29 goals and 77 assists for 106 points. In addition, Chad Starling won the award for the highest plus/minus rating.\n\nThe Cyclones entered the playoffs and defeated the Johnstown Chiefs four games to none. The Cyclones moved on to take on the Reading Royals, Cincinnati took the series in seven games to claim their second ever North Division playoff title. The Cyclones then defeated the South Carolina Stingrays, 2–1 in overtime, to claim the American Conference Championship in five games. With their victory, Cincinnati also claimed the E.A. \"Bud\" Gingher Memorial Trophy.\n\nThe Cyclones then defeated the National Conference Champion Las Vegas Wranglers in the Kelly Cup Finals, clinching their first championship in team history in six games. After splitting the first two games in Cincinnati (Cincinnati 4–3 and Las Vegas 1–0), the series shifted to Las Vegas, where Cincinnati won games three and five to take a 3–2 series lead. In front of a record setting crowd, 12,722 fans, at US Bank Arena in Cincinnati on June 5, the Cyclones defeated Las Vegas in game six, 3–1, to take the championship and their 71st win of the season. Goalie Cedrick Desjardins was named the Kelly Cup Playoff MVP.\n\nAfter the Cyclones cup win coach Chuck Weber and assistant coach Dean Stork received multi-year extensions. Weber was also given the title of vice president. On November 29, Weber picked up his 100th professional head coaching victory with a 6–3 win at Johnstown.\n\nCincinnati's 2008–09 season was not as successful as the previous one, but they won 41 games for 87 points, repeating as North Division champions. They won a seven-game series against the Wheeling Nailers, including a double overtime game seven win, and swept the Elmira Jackals to win the North Division playoff title. However, the Cyclones would be swept by the South Carolina Stingrays in the American Conference Finals.\n\nThe 2009–10 season proved to be more successful with 44 wins and 91 points, the wins total being the most in the American Conference. Despite that, the Cyclones finished second in the North Division to the Kalamazoo Wings and fifth in the conference. This led to a rematch with fourth seeded, and defending champion, South Carolina in the first round, where Cincinnati defeated the Stingrays in five games. Veteran captain Barrett Eghotz scored in overtime for the 3–2 win in game five and was the third straight overtime game in the series. The Cyclones then faced the top seeded Charlotte Checkers, defeating the Checkers in game seven with a 2–1 victory.\n\nCincinnati drew the Reading Royals in the American Conference Final. The seven game series was marred by several incidents, both on and off the ice, that resulted in suspensions and fines to players and staff of both organizations. The worst occurred after game six, when Reading's Scott Fletcher allegedly struck a Cincinnati fan with a stick, drawing an indefinite suspension by the league. Nevertheless, the series made ECHL history when, after losing the first two at home, then game three at Reading, Cincinnati posted wins of 6–4, 5–0 and 6–3 to force the team's third winner-take-all game in the 2010 playoffs. In front of 5,340 fans, the Cyclones posted a 1–0 win to become the first team in ECHL history, and the sixth professional hockey team in history, to come back from a 3–0 deficit to win a best of seven series. The only goal of the contest was scored by Barret Ehgoetz 13:48 into the game.\n\nThe Cyclones defeated the Idaho Steelheads in the 2010 Kelly Cup Final, four-games-to-one. Cincinnati scored game-winning goals within the last minute in the first two games, a 3–2 win on a goal by Mark Van Guilder with 49.2 seconds remaining on May 14, and a 1–0 win the next night, when Mathieu Aubin netted the only goal in the contest and only with 20.1 seconds remaining in regulation. The series shifted to US Bank Arena and witnessed an Idaho victory within the first minute of the second overtime of game three, as Evan Barlow received a pass at the bottom of the right circle and fired the puck into a largely vacated goal, as Cyclones goalie Robert Mayer had committed to the left side.\n\nIn front of yet another ECHL playoff record setting crowd of 13,483 at US Bank Arena in Cincinnati, the Cyclones defeated Idaho in game five, 2–1, to take the championship. With the victory, the Cyclones clinched their second Kelly Cup title in three years. The game was also the Cyclones 24th Kelly Cup playoff game, surpassing the club record of 22 postseason games played by the 2008 championship team and is one more than South Carolina (23) had in its title run in 2009. Rookie Cyclones goaltenders Robert Mayer and Jeremy Smith were named co-winners of the Kelly Cup playoffs MVP. Cincinnati finished with a total record of 59–32–4.\n\nThe Cyclones underwent several changes before the 2010–11 season when assistant coach Dean Stork became the head coach of the Greenville Road Warriors in June and head coach Chuck Weber was promoted to the American Hockey League as head coach of the Rochester Americans on July 27. On August 4, Cincinnati signed a new affiliation agreement with the NHL's Florida Panthers, who used Rochester as their AHL farm team, creating a working relationship between Chuck Weber and his former Cyclones team. On August 12, Cincinnati named Jarrod Skalde as the new head coach. After undergoing this major coaching overhaul and losing a large portion of their roster, the Cyclones went on to post their third lowest points total in franchise history. They were still able to earn a seventh seed in the ECHL playoffs, but lost in the first round to Reading Royals, three-games-to-one.\n\nIn 2011, the Florida Panthers moved their AHL affiliation to the San Antonio Rampage as well their AHL head coach, Chuck Weber.. Despite heavy support by new AHL affiliate, the 2011–12 season would still be unsuccessful. The Cyclones had a slow start to the season and while they stayed competitive throughout the rest of the season, they earned only 35 wins and 79 points. Cincinnati would finish tenth in the conference, marking only the third time in their 20-season history that they did not make the playoffs.\n\nThe Cyclones made a complete turnaround the next season, beginning the season unbeaten in regulation for the first nine games. Their 42 wins and 92 points won the North Division regular season championship, their third such accolade in six seasons, and placed them second in the Eastern Conference. The season earned head coach Jarrod Skalde Coach of the Year honors. Cincinnati would go on to win a pair of six-game wins against the Toledo Walleye and Gwinnett Gladiators before losing a five-game conference final to the top seeded Reading Royals, who would go on to win the Kelly Cup.\n\nOn July 9, 2013, coach Skalde accepted an assistant's position with the AHL's Norfolk Admirals, becoming the second consecutive Cyclones coach to be promoted to a higher level. Before the 2014–15 season, Skalde was appointed as Norfolk's head coach.\nCincinnati came back strong under new head coach Ben Simon in 2013–14, with 41 wins and 91 points for a fifth-place finish in the Eastern Conference. Cincinnati would win three series against the Orlando Solar Bears, Fort Wayne Komets, and Greenville Road Warriors, all in six games, earning their third trip to the Kelly Cup Finals. They faced the Brabham Cup winning Alaska Aces, but would lose the series in six games. Despite the loss in the final, Cincinnati goaltender Rob Madore was named Most Valuable Player of the 2014 Kelly Cup playoffs, becoming the first player from the losing team to win the award in the ECHL's 26-year history, and the fourth Cincinnati goaltender to either win the trophy outright or share the trophy. Madore earned the award after leading the ECHL with all 14 of Cincinnati's playoff wins, 1,493 minutes of play, and a Cincinnati record 756 saves while playing every second of Cincinnati's 24 playoff games.\n\nAfter the season, coach Simon accepted a role with the Toronto Marlies, the top affiliate of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Simon became the third consecutive Cyclones head coach to accept a role in the AHL. Following Simon's promotion, Matt Macdonald became Cincinnati's head coach. In the 2014–15 season, Cincinnati finished fifth in the North Division of the Eastern Conference with a record of 31–30–2–9. The team would miss the playoffs by only three points.\n\nOn February 27, 2016, the Cyclones played in front of their first-ever sellout at US Bank Arena with 16,529 fans were in attendance for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Night and one dollar pizza slices. While the game was a 3–2 shootout loss to the Indy Fuel, the Cyclones set the record for the largest crowd for a professional hockey game in the 41-year history of US Bank Arena.\n\nAfter ten seasons, the Nashville Predators and Milwaukee Admirals ended their affiliation with the Cyclones prior to the 2017–18 season. The Cyclones then found affiliations with the Buffalo Sabres and Rochester Americans. This is the second time Buffalo has affiliated with a Cincinnati hockey team, after the Sabres' affiliation with the Cincinnati Swords in the 1970s.\n\nPrior to the 2018–19 season, head coach Matt Mcdonald was hired as an assistant with the Grand Rapids Griffins in the AHL. He was replaced by Matt Thomas, who then led the team to the regular season title and second Brabham Cup in franchise history and won the John Brophy Award for coach of the year. Despite the regular season success, the team lost in the division finals four games to one to the Toledo Walleye.\n\nAfter introducing their current mascot, Twister, in 1995, the Cyclones had always included him in their uniform design. In fact, from 1996–2014 he was the centerpiece of the jerseys they wore. However, prior to the 2014–15 season, the organization did a complete revamp of the uniforms and their colors. Twister was removed from the uniform completely along with the color yellow. The shade of red used was also changed from a darker maroonish style red to a more bright royal red. The logo now is described as being a twister, or cyclone, in the center of a \"C\" standing for, Cincinnati. The jersey concepts also changed from being a classic hockey style to a more modern era look. The home, away, and alternate jerseys have red shoulders and red stripes that begin at the elbow area and wrap around to the underside of the wrists. The home jerseys are base white with red trim, the away jerseys are base black with red trim, and the alternates are base grey with black trim. Other than the change in color, all three jerseys are similar.\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime losses, SOL = Shootout losses, Pts = Points, PCT = Winning percentage, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalty infraction minutes\"\n\nUpdated May 14, 2020.\n\n\n\n"}

The Norfolk Island Regional Council is based in Kingston. The town is the second-oldest in Australia, founded a little over a month after Sydney.\n\nKingston is located on the east-west aligned Kingston Plain which rises from the coast to about above sea level in the foothills of the Kingston escarpment. The plain is long by about wide, with calcareous lime sands to the south along the coast and basaltic clays to the north along the foothills. The western end of the plain is marked by the high Flagstaff Hill. Watermill Creek traverses the plain after leaving Arthur's Vale to the north-west, and is joined by Town Creek and several minor tributaries to form the Kingston swamps before draining into Emily Bay. Most of the accessible beaches on the island are located along the Kingston foreshores. Southwards, Emily Bay and Slaughter Bay open into the Kingston lagoon and reefs and the broad expanse of Sydney Bay. Eastwards, Cemetery Bay opens directly into the South Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe town was founded on 6 March 1788 by Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including 9 male and 6 female convicts) who landed that day from HMT \"Supply\". They had sailed from Port Jackson just a few weeks after the establishment of the British colony of New South Wales. The settlement was initially known as Sidney or Sydney Bay, and by 1796 was being called the Town of Sydney, in honour of Viscount Sydney, British Home Secretary and patron of the First Fleet. King established a house on the hill over the town, but the mass of roots in the ground caused him to call it \"rooty hill\", which name was also later transferred to Rooty Hill, New South Wales when King later established a house there.\n\nThe old town dating from 1788 occupies several winding irregular lanes at the head of Kingston Pier. The modern town, as laid out by the Royal Engineers during the 1830s, consists of a Roman-style grid plan. There are two long east west roads: Bay Street along the foreshore and Quality Row, the town's principal thoroughfare, along the foothills. These two boulevards are connected by short cross streets of Pier Street, Bounty Street and the former Bligh Street (now part of the drive to Government House). Small stone bridges carry these streets across Watermill Creek. Four roads wind up country from the edges of the grid: Country Road, Middlegate Road, Rooty Hill Road and Driver Christian Road. All the buildings are located either in the old town or along Quality Row, with the exception of Government House which is located on a small knoll called Dove's Plot Hill. The middle and west of the plain forms the Kingston Common and Kingston Recreation Ground, with the golf links occupying the eastern end, and Kingston Cemetery in the north-east. This broad greensward with the Kingston swamp in its centre separates the two long boulevards.\n\nMunicipal government functions on Norfolk Island are the responsibility of the Norfolk Island Regional Council, based in the New Military Barracks in Kingston.\n\nThe town of Burnt Pine is about to the north-west, and the hamlet of Middlegate is about to the north. The uninhabited Nepean Island and Phillip Island dominate the sea view from Kingston.\n\nKingston is in the centre of the Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area, which was inscribed on the World Heritage List on 31 July 2010 as one of the group of eleven Australian Convict Sites.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2233890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233890", "title": "Spanish and Portuguese Jews", "text": "Spanish and Portuguese Jews\n\nSpanish and Portuguese Jews, also called Western Sephardim, are a distinctive sub-group of Iberian Jews who are largely descended from Jews who lived as New Christians in the Iberian Peninsula during the immediate generations following the forced expulsion of unconverted Jews from Spain in 1492 and from Portugal in 1497.\n\nAlthough the 1492 and 1497 expulsions of unconverted Jews from Spain and Portugal were separate events from the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions (which was established over a decade earlier in 1478), they were ultimately linked, as the Inquisition eventually also led to the fleeing out of Iberia of many descendants of Jewish converts to Catholicism in subsequent generations.\n\nDespite the fact that the original Edicts of Expulsion did not apply to Jewish-origin New Christian \"conversos\" —as these were now legally Christians— the discriminatory practices that the Inquisition nevertheless placed upon them, which were often lethal, put immense pressure on many of the Jewish-origin Christians to also emigrate out of Spain and Portugal in the immediate generations following the expulsion of their unconverted Jewish brethren.\n\nThe Alhambra Decree (also known as the Edict of Expulsion) was an edict issued on 31 March 1492, by the joint Catholic Monarchs of Spain (Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon) ordering the expulsion of all unconverted practicing Jews from the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, including from all its territories and possessions, by 31 July of that year. The primary purpose of the expulsion was to eliminate the influence of unconverted Jews on Spain's by then large Jewish-origin New Christian converso population, to ensure that the prior did not encourage the latter to relapse and revert to Judaism.\n\nOver half of Spain's Jewish origin population had converted to Catholicism as a result of the religious anti-Jewish persecution and pogroms which occurred in 1391. As a result of the Alhambra decree and persecution in prior years, it is estimated that of Spain's total Jewish origin population at the time, over 200,000 Jews converted to Catholicism, and initially remained in Spain. Between 40,000 and 80,000 did not convert to Catholicism, and by their steadfast commitment to remain Jewish were thus expelled. Of those who were expelled as unconverted Jews, an indeterminate number nonetheless converted to Catholicism once outside Spain and eventually returned to Spain in the years following the expulsion due to the hardships many experienced in their resettlement. Many of Spain's Jews who left Spain as Jews also initially moved to Portugal, where they were subsequently forcibly converted to the Catholic Church in 1497.\n\nMost of the Jews who left Spain as Jews accepted the hospitality of Sultan Bayezid II and, after the Alhambra Decree, moved to the Ottoman Empire, where they founded communities openly practising the Jewish religion; they and their descendants are known as Eastern Sephardim.\n\nDuring the centuries following the Spanish and Portuguese decrees, some of the Jewish-origin New Christian conversos started emigrating from Portugal and Spain, settling until the 1700s throughout areas of Western Europe and non-Iberian realms of the colonial Americas (mostly Dutch realms, including Curaçao in the Dutch West Indies, Recife in Dutch areas of colonial Brazil which eventually were regained by the Portuguese, and New Amsterdam which later became New York) forming communities and formally reverting to Judaism. It is the collective of these communities and their descendants who are known as Western Sephardim, and are the subject of this article.\n\nAs the early members of the Western Sephardim consisted of persons who themselves (or whose immediate forebears) personally experienced an interim period as New Christians, which resulted in unceasing trials and persecutions of crypto-Judaism by the Portuguese and Spanish Inquisitions, the early community continued to be augmented by further New Christian emigration pouring out of the Iberian Peninsula in a continuous flow between the 1600s to 1700s. Jewish-origin New Christians were officially considered Christians due to their forced or coerced conversions; as such they were subject to the jurisdiction of the Catholic Church's Inquisitorial system, and were subject to harsh heresy and apostasy laws if they continued to practice their ancestral Jewish faith. Those New Christians who eventually fled both the Iberian cultural sphere and jurisdiction of the Inquisition were able to officially return to Judaism and open Jewish practice once they were in their new tolerant environments of refuge.\n\nAs former conversos or their descendants, Western Sephardim developed a distinctive ritual based on the remnants of the Judaism of pre-expulsion Spain, which some had practiced in secrecy during their time as New Christians, and influenced by Judaism as practiced by the communities (including Sephardic Jews of the Ottoman Empire and Ashkenazi Jews) which assisted them in their readoption of normative Judaism; as well as by the Spanish-Moroccan and the Italian Jewish rites practiced by rabbis and hazzanim recruited from those communities to instruct them in ritual practice. A part of their distinctiveness as a Jewish group, furthermore, stems from the fact that they saw themselves as forced to \"redefine their Jewish identity and mark its boundaries [...] with the intellectual tools they had acquired in their Christian socialization\" during their time as New Christian conversos.\n\nThe main 'Western Sephardic Jewish' communities developed in Western Europe, Italy, and the non-Iberian regions of the Americas.\n\nIn addition to the term \"Western Sephardim\", this sub-group of Sephardic Jews is sometimes also referred to also as \"Spanish and Portuguese Jews,\" \"Spanish Jews,\" \"Portuguese Jews,\" or \"Jews of the Portuguese Nation.\"\n\nThe term \"Western Sephardim\" is frequently used in modern research literature to refer to \"Spanish and Portuguese Jews,\" but sometimes also to \"Spanish-Moroccan Jews\".\n\nThe use of the terms \"Portuguese Jews\" and \"Jews of the Portuguese Nation\" in areas such as the Netherlands, Hamburg, Scandinavia, and at one time in London, seems to have arisen primarily as a way for the \"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\" to distance themselves from Spain in the times of political tension and war between Spain and the Netherlands in the 17th century. Similar considerations may have played a role for ethnic Sephardic Jews in the French regions of Bayonne and Bordeaux, given their proximity to the Spanish border.\n\nAnother reason for the terminology of \"Portuguese\" Jews may have been that a relatively high proportion of the families in question had Portugal as their immediate point of departure from the Iberian peninsula, regardless of whether the remoter family background was nonetheless Spanish, since Portugal was the first place of refuge and transit point for many Spanish Jews immediately following their expulsion from Spain.\n\nAs the term \"Sephardim\" (when used in its ethnic sense) necessarily connotes a link with Spain, the distinguishing feature of the Western subgroup was the added link with Portugal. Thus, as a subset of the Sephardim, \"Portuguese\" and \"Spanish and Portuguese\" could be used interchangeably. Finally, almost all organised communities in this group traditionally employed Portuguese rather than Spanish as their official or working language.\n\nIn Italy, the term \"Spanish Jews\" (\"Ebrei Spagnoli\") is frequently used, but it includes descendants of Jews expelled as Jews from the Kingdom of Naples, as well as \"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\" proper (i.e. Jews descended from former conversos and their descendants).\n\nIn Venice, Spanish and Portuguese Jews were often described as \"Ponentine\" (Western), to distinguish them from \"Levantine\" (Eastern) Sephardim from Eastern Mediterranean areas. Occasionally Italian Jews distinguish between the \"Portuguese Jews\" of Pisa and Livorno and the \"Spanish Jews\" of Venice, Modena and elsewhere.\n\nThe scholar Joseph Dan distinguishes \"medieval Sephardim\" (15th and 16th-century Spanish exiles in the Ottoman Empire who arrived as Jews) from \"Renaissance Sephardim\" (Spanish and Portuguese former converso communities who arrived as New Christians), in reference to the respective times of each grouping's formative contacts with Spanish language and culture.\n\nThe term Sephardi means \"Spanish\" or \"Hispanic\", and is derived from Sepharad, a Biblical location. The location of the biblical Sepharad is disputed, but Sepharad was identified by later Jews as Hispania, that is, the Iberian Peninsula. Sepharad still means \"Spain\" in modern Hebrew.\n\nThe relationship between Sephardi-descended communities is illustrated in the following diagram:\n\n\"Sephardim\" properly refers to all Jews whose families have extended histories in Spain and Portugal, in contrast to Ashkenazi Jews and all other Jewish ethnic divisions. However, Mizrahi Jews, who have extended histories in the Greater Middle East and North Africa, are often called \"Sephardim\" more broadly in colloquial and religious parlance due to similar styles of liturgy and a certain amount of intermarriage between them and Sephardim proper.\n\nThe main factor distinguishing \"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\" (Western Sephardim) from other \"Sephardim proper\" is that \"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\" refers specifically to those Jews who descend from persons whose history as practising members of Jewish communities with origins in the Iberian peninsula was interrupted by a period of having been New Christians (also known as conversos, the Spanish and Portuguese term for \"converts\" to Catholicism) or anusim (Hebrew for those \"forced\" to convert from Judaism to another faith).\n\nDuring their period as New Christians, many conversos continued to practise their Jewish faith in secrecy as best they could. Those New Christian conversos of Jewish origin who maintained crypto-Jewish practices in secret were termed marranos (Spanish \"swine\") by Old Christian Spaniards and Portuguese.\n\nConversely, those New Christian conversos who have remained as conversos since that time, both those in the Iberian Peninsula and those who moved to the Iberian colonial possessions during the Spanish colonization of the Americas, became the related Sephardic Bnei Anusim. Sephardic Bnei Anusim are the contemporary and largely nominally Christian descendants of assimilated 15th century Sephardic Anusim, and are today a fully assimilated sub-group within the Iberian-descended Christian populations of Spain, Portugal, Hispanic America and Brazil. For historical reasons and circumstances, Sephardic Bnei Ansuim have not returned to the Jewish faith over the last five centuries, In modern times, some have begun emerging publicly in increasing numbers, especially in the last two decades.\n\nFor \"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\" (Western Sephardim), their historical period as conversos has shaped their identity, culture, and practices. In this respect, they are clearly distinguishable from those Sephardim who descend from the Jews who left Iberia as Jews before the expiration date for the Alhambra Decree, resulting in the 1492 expulsion from Spain and 1497 expulsion from Portugal of all Jews who had not been baptised into the Catholic faith. These expelled Jews settled mainly around the Mediterranean Basin of Southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, namely, Salonika, the Balkans and Turkey, and they became the Eastern Sephardim and North African Sephardim respectively. For centuries, the Sephardic Jewish communities under Ottoman rule provided spiritual leadership to the dispersed Sephardim through their contributions to the Responsa literature. These Sephardic communities offered refuge to all Jews, including the Sephardi Jewish-origin New Christian conversos fleeing the Inquisition across Europe, as well as their Eastern European Ashkenazi coreligionists fleeing pogroms.\n\nThe common feature shared by Western Sephardim (\"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\") to Sephardic Bnei Anusim and Neo-Western Sephardim is that all three are descended from conversos. \"Western Sephardim\" are descendants of former conversos of earlier centuries; \"Sephardic Bnei Anusim\" are the still nominally Christian descendants of conversos; and \"Neo-Western Sephardim\" are the increasing in number modern-day former conversos currently returning to Judaism from among the Sephardic Bnei Anusim population.\nThe distinguishing factor between \"Western Sephardim\" and the nascent \"Neo-Western Sephardim\" is the time frame of the reversions to Judaism, the location of the reversions, and the precarious religious and legal circumstances surrounding their reversions, including impediments and persecutions. Thus, the converso descendants who became the Western Sephardim had reverted to Judaism between the 16th and 18th centuries, they did so at a time before the abolition of the Inquisition in the 19th century, and this time frame necessitated their migration out of the Iberian cultural sphere. Conversely, the converso descendants who are today becoming the nascent Neo-Western Sephardim have been reverting to Judaism between the late 20th and early 21st centuries, they have been doing so at a time after the abolition of the Inquisition in the 19th century, and this time frame has not necessitated their migration out of the Iberian cultural sphere.\n\nAlthough Jewish communities were re-established in Spain and Portugal in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, largely with the help of communities of Spanish and Portuguese Jews such as that in London, these present-day Jews in Portugal and Jews in Spain are distinct from \"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\" as, for the most part, the modern Jewish communities resident in Spain and Portugal also include other Jewish ethnic divisions recently immigrated to Spain and Portugal, such as Ashkenazi Jews of Northern Europe.\n\nIn modern Iberia, practicing Jews of Sephardic origins, such as the Jewish community of Oporto, however, are also not Western Sephardim, but are Neo-Western Sephardim, as they were re-established in the 20th century and early 21st centuries with a campaign of outreach to the crypto-Jews of Sephardic Bnei Anusim origins. The Oporto community's return to Judaism was led by the returnee to Judaism Captain Artur Carlos de Barros Basto (1887–1961), known also as the \"apostle of the Marranos\". In 1921, realizing that there were less than twenty Ashkenazi Jews living in Porto, and that recent returnees to Judaism like himself were not organized and had to travel to Lisbon for religious purposes whenever necessary, Barros Basto began to think about building a synagogue and took initiative in 1923 to officially register the Jewish Community of Porto and the Israelite Theological Center in the city council of Porto. As mentioned, these communities of modern-day returnees to Judaism are among the first in the emergence of the nascent Neo-Western Sephardim. Neo-Western Sephardim are the modern returnees to Judaism throughout Iberia and Ibero-America emerging from among the population of Sephardic Bnei Anusim, and are distinct from Western Sephardim (those termed \"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\").\n\nEven more recent examples of such Neo-Western Sephardim communities include the Belmonte Jews in Portugal, and the Xuetes of Spain. In the case of the Xuetes, the entire community of converso descendants was extended a blanket recognition as Jews by Rabbinical authorities in Israel due to their particular historical circumstances on the island which effectively resulted in a strict social isolation of the Xuetes imposed upon them by their non-Jewish-descended neighbors up until modern times.\n\nIn the last five to ten years, \"organized groups of [Sephardic] Benei Anusim have been established in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and in Sefarad [the Iberian Peninsula] itself\". have also now been established. Some members of these communities have formally reverted to Judaism.\n\nSpanish and Portuguese Jews were originally descended from New Christian conversos (i.e. Jews converted to Roman Catholic Christianity) whose descendants later left the Iberian peninsula and reverted to Judaism.\n\nAlthough legend has it that conversos existed as early as the Visigothic period, and that there was a continuous phenomenon of crypto-Judaism from that time lasting throughout Spanish history, this scenario is unlikely, as in the Muslim period of Iberia there was no advantage in passing as a Christian instead of publicly acknowledging one was a Jew. The main wave of conversions, often forced, followed The Massacre of 1391 in Spain. Legal definitions of that era theoretically acknowledged that a forced baptism was not a valid sacrament, but the Church confined this to cases where it was literally administered by physical force: a person who had consented to baptism under threat of death or serious injury was still regarded as a voluntary convert, and accordingly forbidden to revert to Judaism. Crypto-Judaism as a large-scale phenomenon mainly dates from that time.\n\nConversos, whatever their real religious views, often (but not always) tended to marry and associate among themselves. As they achieved prominent positions in trade and in the Royal administration, they attracted considerable resentment from the \"Old Christians\". The ostensible reason given for issuance of the 1492 Alhambra Decree for the conversion, expulsion or execution of the unconverted Jews from Spain was that the unconverted Jews had supported the New Christian conversos in the crypto-Jewish practices of the latter, thus delaying or preventing their assimilation into the Christian community.\n\nAfter the issuance of Spain's Alhambra Decree in 1492, a large proportion of the unconverted Jews chose exile rather than conversion, many of them crossing the border to Portugal. In Portugal, however, the Jews were again issued with a similar decree just a few years later in 1497, giving them the choice of exile or conversion. Unlike in Spain, however, in actual practice Portugal mostly prevented them from leaving, thus they necessarily stayed as ostensible converts to Christianity whether they wished to or not, after the Portuguese King reasoned that by their failure to leave they accepted Christianity by default. For this reason, crypto-Judaism was far more prevalent in Portugal than in Spain, even though many of these families were originally of Spanish rather than Portuguese descent. Over time, however, most crypto-Jews both of Spanish and Portuguese ancestry had left Portugal by the 18th century.\n\nScholars are still divided on the typical religious loyalties of the conversos, in particular on whether they are appropriately described as \"crypto-Jews\". Given the secrecy surrounding their situation, the question is not easy to answer: probably the conversos themselves were divided, and could be ranged at different points between the possible positions. The suggested profiles are as follows:\n\nFor these reasons, there was a continuous flow of people leaving Spain and Portugal (mostly Portugal) for places where they could practise Judaism openly, from 1492 until the end of the 18th century. They were generally accepted by the host Jewish communities as \"anusim\" (forced converts), whose conversion, being involuntary, did not compromise their Jewish status. \n\nConversos of the first generation after the expulsion still had some knowledge of Judaism based on memory of contact with a living Jewish community. In later generations, people had to avoid known Jewish practices that might attract undesired attention: conversos in group 3 evolved a home-made Judaism with practices peculiar to themselves, while those in group 2 had a purely intellectual conception of Judaism based on their reading of ancient Jewish sources preserved by the Church such as the Vulgate Old Testament, the Apocrypha, Philo and Josephus. Both groups therefore needed extensive re-education in Judaism after reaching their places of refuge outside the peninsula. This was achieved with the help of\n\nThere are still Jewish communities in the North African exclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. These places, though treated in most respects as integral parts of Spain, escaped the Inquisition and the expulsion, so these communities regard themselves as the remnant of pre-expulsion Spanish Jewry.\n\nAs Sephardic Jewish communities were established in central and northern Italy, following the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 and from the Kingdom of Naples in 1533, these areas were an obvious destination for conversos wishing to leave Spain and Portugal. The similarity of the Italian language to Spanish was another attraction. Given their Christian cultural background and high level of European-style education, the new emigrants were less likely to follow the example of the 1492 expellees by settling in the Ottoman Empire, where a complete culture change would be required.\n\nOn the other hand, in Italy they ran the risk of prosecution for Judaizing, given that in law they were baptized Christians; for this reason they generally avoided the Papal States. The Popes did allow some Spanish-Jewish settlement at Ancona, as this was the main port for the Turkey trade, in which their links with the Ottoman Sephardim were useful. Other states found it advantageous to allow the conversos to settle and mix with the existing Jewish communities, and to turn a blind eye to their religious status. In the next generation, the children of conversos could be brought up as fully Jewish with no legal problem, as they had never been baptized.\n\nThe main places of settlement were as follows:\n\nOn the whole, the Spanish and Portuguese Jews remained separate from the native Italian rite Jews, though there was considerable mutual religious and intellectual influence between the groups. In a given city, there was often an \"Italian synagogue\" and a \"Spanish synagogue\", and occasionally a \"German synagogue\" as well. Many of these synagogues have since merged, but the diversity of rites survived in modern Italy.\n\nThe Spanish Synagogue (\"Scola Spagnola\") of Venice was originally regarded as the \"mother synagogue\" for the Spanish and Portuguese community worldwide, as it was among the earliest to be established, and the first prayer book was published there. Later communities, such as in Amsterdam, followed its lead on ritual questions. With the decline in the importance of Venice in the 18th century, the leading role passed to Livorno (for Italy and the Mediterranean) and Amsterdam (for western countries). Unfortunately, the Livorno synagogue – considered to be the most important building in town – was destroyed in the Second World War: a modern building was erected on the same site in 1958–1962.\n\nMany merchants maintained a presence in both Italy and countries in the Ottoman Empire, and even those who settled permanently in the Ottoman Empire retained their Tuscan or other Italian nationality, so as to have the benefit of the capitulations of the Ottoman Empire. Thus, in Tunisia there was a community of \"Juifs Portugais\", or \"L'Grana\" (Livornese), separate from, and regarding itself as superior to, the native Tunisian Jews (\"Tuansa\"). Smaller communities of the same kind existed in other countries, such as Syria, where they were known as \"Señores Francos\". They were generally not numerous enough to establish their own synagogues, instead meeting for prayer in each other's houses.\n\nIn the 16th and early 17th centuries, conversos were also seeking refuge beyond the Pyrenees, settling in France at Saint-Jean-de-Luz, Tarbes, Bayonne, Bordeaux, Marseille, and Montpellier. They lived apparently as Christians; were married by Catholic priests; had their children baptized, and publicly pretended to be Catholics. In secret, however, they circumcised their children, kept Shabbat and feast-days as best they could and prayed together.\n\nHenry III of France confirmed the privileges granted them by Henry II of France, and protected them against accusations. Under Louis XIII of France, the conversos of Bayonne were assigned to the suburb of . At Saint-Esprit, as well as at Peyrehorade, Bidache, Orthez, Biarritz, and Saint-Jean-de-Luz, they gradually avowed Judaism openly. In 1640 several hundred conversos, considered to be Jews, were living at Saint-Jean-de-Luz; and a synagogue existed in Saint-Esprit as early as 1660.\n\nIn pre-Revolutionary France, the Portuguese Jews were one of three tolerated Jewish communities, the other two being the Ashkenazi Jews of Alsace-Lorraine and the Jews of the former Papal enclave of Comtat Venaissin; all three groups were emancipated at the French Revolution. The third community originally had their own Provençal rite, but adopted the Spanish and Portuguese rite shortly after the French Revolution and the incorporation of Comtat Venaissin into France. Today there are still a few Spanish and Portuguese communities in Bordeaux and Bayonne, and one in Paris, but in all these communities (and still more among French Jews generally) any surviving Spanish and Portuguese Jews are greatly outnumbered by recent Sephardic migrants of North African origin.\n\nDuring the Spanish occupation of the Netherlands, converso merchants had a strong trading presence there. When the Dutch Republic gained independence in 1581, the Dutch retained trading links with Portugal rather than Spain, as Spain was regarded as a hostile power. Since there were penal laws against Catholics, and Catholicism was regarded with greater hostility than Judaism, New Christian conversos (technically Catholics, as that was the Christian tradition they were forced into) were encouraged by the Dutch to \"come out\" openly as Jews. Given the multiplicity of Protestant sects, the Netherlands was the first country in the Western world to establish a policy of religious tolerance. This made Amsterdam a magnet for conversos leaving Portugal.\n\nThere were originally three Sephardi communities: the first, \"Beth Jacob\", already existed in 1610, and perhaps as early as 1602; \"Neve Shalom\" was founded between 1608 and 1612 by Jews of Spanish origin. The third community, \"Beth Israel\", was established in 1618. These three communities began co-operating more closely in 1622. Eventually, in 1639, they merged to form \"Talmud Torah\", the Portuguese Jewish Community of Amsterdam, which still exists today. The current Portuguese Synagogue, sometimes known as the \"Amsterdam Esnoga\", was inaugurated in 1675, of which Abraham Cohen Pimentel was the head Rabbi.\n\nAt first the Dutch conversos had little knowledge of Judaism and had to recruit rabbis and \"hazzanim\" from Italy, and occasionally Morocco and Salonica, to teach them. Later on Amsterdam became a centre of religious learning: a religious college \"Ets Haim\" was established, with a copious Jewish and general library. This library still exists. The transactions of the college, mainly in the form of responsa, were published in a periodical, \"Peri Ets Haim\" (see links below). There were formerly several Portuguese synagogues in other cities such as The Hague. Since the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands and destruction of Jews in the Second World War, the Amsterdam synagogue is the only remaining synagogue of the Portuguese rite in the Netherlands. It serves a membership of about 600. The synagogue at the Hague survived the war undamaged: it is now the Liberal Synagogue and no longer belongs to the \"Portuguese\" community.\n\nThe position of Jews in the Spanish Netherlands (modern Belgium) was rather different. Considerable numbers of conversos lived there, in particular in Antwerp. The Inquisition was not allowed to operate. Nevertheless their practice of Judaism remained under cover and unofficial, as acts of Judaizing in Belgium could expose one to proceedings elsewhere in the Spanish possessions. Sporadic persecutions alternated with periods of unofficial toleration. The position improved somewhat in 1713, with the cession of the southern Netherlands to Austria, but no community was officially formed until the 19th century. There is a Portuguese synagogue in Antwerp; its members, like those of the Sephardic rite synagogues of Brussels, are now predominantly of North African origin, and few if any pre-War families or traditions remain.\n\nThere were Portuguese Jews living in Hamburg as early as the 1590s. Records attest to their having a small synagogue called \"Talmud Torah\" in 1627, and the main synagogue, \"Beth Israel\", was founded in 1652. From the 18th century on, the Portuguese Jews were increasingly outnumbered by \"German Jews\" (Ashkenazim). By 1900, they were thought to number only about 400.\n\nA small branch of the Portuguese community was located in Altona, with a congregation known as \"Neweh Schalom\". Historically, however, the Jewish community of Altona was overwhelmingly Ashkenazi, as Altona belonged to the kingdom of Denmark, which permitted Jews of all communities to settle there when Hamburg proper still only admitted the Portuguese.\n\nSpanish and Portuguese Jews had an intermittent trading presence in Norway until the early 19th century, and were granted full residence rights in 1844. Today they have no separate organizational identity from the general (mainly Ashkenazi) Jewish community, though traditions survive in some families.\n\nAround 1550, many Sephardi Jews travelled across Europe to find their haven in Poland, which had the largest Jewish population in the whole of Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries. For this reason there are still Polish Jewish surnames with a possible Spanish origin. However, most of them quickly assimilated into the Ashkenazi community and retained no separate identity.\n\nThere were certainly Spanish and Portuguese merchants, many of them conversos, in England at the time of Queen Elizabeth I; one notable marrano was the physician Roderigo Lopez. In the time of Oliver Cromwell, Menasseh Ben Israel led a delegation seeking permission for Dutch Sephardim to settle in England: Cromwell was known to look favourably on the request, but no official act of permission has been found. By the time of Charles II and James II, a congregation of Spanish and Portuguese Jews had a synagogue in Creechurch Lane. Both these kings showed their assent to this situation by quashing indictments against the Jews for unlawful assembly. For this reason the Spanish and Portuguese Jews of England often cite 1656 as the year of re-admission, but look to Charles II as the real sponsor of their community.\n\nBevis Marks Synagogue was opened in 1701 in London. In the 1830s and 40s there was agitation for the formation of a branch synagogue in the West End, nearer where most congregants lived, but rabbis refused this on the basis of \"Ascama 1\", forbidding the establishment of other synagogues within six miles of Bevis Marks. Dissident congregants, together with some Ashkenazim, accordingly founded the West London Synagogue in Burton Street in 1841. An official branch synagogue in Wigmore Street was opened in 1853. This moved to Bryanston Street in the 1860s, and to Lauderdale Road in Maida Vale in 1896. A private synagogue existed in Islington from 1865 to 1884, and another in Highbury from 1885 to 1936. A third synagogue has been formed in Wembley. Over the centuries the community has absorbed many Sephardi immigrants from Italy and North Africa, including many of its rabbis and \"hazzanim\". The current membership includes many Iraqi Jews and some Ashkenazim, in addition to descendants of the original families. The Wembley community is predominantly Egyptian.\n\nThe synagogues at Bevis Marks, Lauderdale Road and Wembley are all owned by the same community, formally known as \"Sahar Asamaim\" (Sha'ar ha-Shamayim), and have no separate organisational identities. The community is served by a team rabbinate: the post of \"Haham\", or chief rabbi, is currently vacant (and has frequently been so in the community's history), the current head being known as the \"Senior Rabbi\". The day-to-day running of the community is the responsibility of a \"Mahamad\", elected periodically and consisting of a number of \"parnasim\" (wardens) and one \"gabbay\" (treasurer). . Under the current Senior Rabbi, Joseph Dweck, the name of the community has been changed from \"Congregation of Spanish and Portuguese Jews\" to \"S&P Sephardi Community\".\n\nIn addition to the three main synagogues, there is the Montefiore Synagogue at Ramsgate associated with the burial place of Moses Montefiore. A synagogue in Holland Park is described as \"Spanish and Portuguese\" but serves chiefly Greek and Turkish Jews, with a mixed ritual: it is connected to the main community by a Deed of Association. The Manchester Sephardic synagogues are under the superintendence of the London community and traditionally used a predominantly Spanish and Portuguese ritual, which is giving way to a Jerusalem Sephardic style: the membership is chiefly Syrian in heritage, with some Turkish, Iraqi and North African Jews. The London community formerly had oversight over some Baghdadi synagogues in the Far East, such as the Ohel Leah Synagogue in Hong Kong and Ohel Rachel Synagogue in Shanghai. An informal community using the Spanish and Portuguese rite, and known as the \"Rambam Synagogue\", exists in Elstree and a further minyan has been established in Hendon. Newer Sephardic rite synagogues in London, mostly for Baghdadi and Persian Jews, preserve their own ritual and do not come under the Spanish and Portuguese umbrella.\n\nLike the Amsterdam community, the London Spanish and Portuguese community early set up a \"Medrash do Heshaim\" (\"Ets Haim\"). This is less a functioning religious college than a committee of dignitaries responsible for community publications, such as prayer books. In 1862 the community founded the \"Judith Lady Montefiore College\" in Ramsgate, for the training of rabbis. This moved to London in the 1960s: students at the College concurrently followed courses at Jews' College (now the London School of Jewish Studies). Judith Lady Montefiore College closed in the 1980s, but was revived in 2005 as a part-time rabbinic training programme run from Lauderdale Road, serving the Anglo-Jewish Orthodox community in general, Ashkenazim as well as Sephardim.\n\nFrom the 16th to the 18th centuries, a majority of conversos leaving Portugal went to Brazil. This included economic emigrants with no interest in reverting to Judaism. As the Inquisition was active in Brazil as well as in Portugal, conversos still had to be careful.\n\nDutch Sephardim were interested in colonisation, and formed communities in both Curaçao and Paramaribo, Suriname. Between 1630 and 1654, a Dutch colony existed in the north-east of Brazil, including Recife. This attracted both conversos from Portuguese Brazil and Jewish emigrants from Holland, who formed a community in Recife called \"Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue\", the first synagogue in the Americas. On the reconquest of the Recife area by Portugal, many of these Jews (it is not known what percentage) left Brazil for new or existing communities in the Caribbean such as Curaçao. Others formed a new community, Congregation Shearith Israel, in New Amsterdam (later renamed as New York) in 1654, the first Jewish synagogue in what became the United States. Numerous conversos, however, stayed in Brazil. They survived by migrating to the countryside in the province of Paraíba and away from the reinstated Inquisition, which was mostly active in the major cities.\n\nIn the Caribbean, there were at one point Spanish and Portuguese synagogues in various other Dutch- and English-controlled islands, such as Jamaica, St. Thomas, Barbados, St. Eustatius and Nevis. With the elimination of the Inquisition after the Spanish American wars of independence, which many Caribbean Sephardim had supported, many of these communities declined as Jews took advantage of their new-found freedom to move to the mainland, where there were better economic opportunities. Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Costa Rica and Honduras, among others, received numbers of Sephardim. Within a couple of generations, these immigrants mostly converted to Catholicism in order to better integrate into society. Only in Panama and Suriname did viable communities endure on the Central- and South-American mainland. In the 21st century among the Caribbean islands, only Curaçao and Jamaica still have communities of Spanish and Portuguese Jews.\n\nIn Canada, at that time named as 'New France', Esther Brandeau was the first Jewish person to immigrate to Canada, in 1738, disguised as a Roman Catholic boy. She came from Saint-Esprit (Pyrénées-Atlantiques), a district of Bayonne, a port city in Southwestern France, were Spanish and Portuguese Jews had settled.\n\nIn the British Thirteen Colonies, synagogues were formed before the American Revolution at Newport, Rhode Island and Philadelphia, as well as in cities of the southern colonies of South Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia. Since then, many of the former Sephardic synagogues in the southern states and the Caribbean have become part of the Conservative, Reform or Reconstructionist movements, and retain only a few Spanish and Portuguese traditions.\n\nDespite the Dutch origins of the New York community, by the 19th century all of the Spanish and Portuguese Jewish communities in the United States and Canada were very much part of the London-based family. The 19th and early 20th century editions of the prayer book published in London and Philadelphia contained the same basic text, and were designed for use on both sides of the Atlantic: for example, they all contained both a prayer for the Royal family and an alternative for use in republican states. The New York community continued to use these editions until the version of David de Sola Pool was published in 1954. On the other hand, in the first half of the 20th century, the New York community employed a series of \"hazzanim\" from Holland, with the result that the community's musical tradition remained close to that of Amsterdam.\n\nThere are only two remaining Spanish and Portuguese synagogues in the United States: Shearith Israel in New York, and Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia. In both congregations, only a minority of their membership has Western Sephardic ancestry, with the remaining members a mix of Ashkenazim, Levantine Sephardim, Mizrahim, and converts. Newer Sephardic and Sephardic-rite communities, such as the Syrian Jews of Brooklyn and the Greek and Turkish Jews of Seattle, do not come under the Spanish and Portuguese umbrella. The Seattle community did use the de Sola Pool prayer books until the publication of \"Siddur Zehut Yosef\" in 2002. Sephardic Temple Tifereth Israel, a community in Los Angeles with a mainly Turkish ethnic background, still uses the de Sola Pool prayer books.\n\nThe signing of the Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494, divided the world between Portugal, and Spain. Portugal was allotted responsibility over lands east of the Tordesillas meridian. In 1498 Vasco Da Gama arrived on India's western coast where he was first greeted by a Polish Jew - Gaspar da Gama. In 1505 Portugal made Cochin its eastern headquarters, and in 1510 Goa was established as the capital of Portuguese India. \n\nWith the establishment of the Portuguese colonies in Asia, New Christians began flocking to India's western coast. Regarding Goa, the Jewish Virtual Library states that \"From the early decades of the 16 century many New Christians from Portugal came to Goa. The influx soon aroused the opposition of the Portuguese and ecclesiastical authorities, who complained bitterly about the New Christians' influence in economic affairs, their monopolistic practices, and their secret adherence to Judaism.\" Professor Walter Fischel of University of California, Berkeley observes that despite of the start of the inquisition in Portugal, the Portuguese relied heavily Jews and New Christians in establishing their fledgling Asian empire. The influence of Jews and New Christians in Goa was substantial. In his book\", The Marrano Factory,\" Professor Antonio Saraiva of the University of Lisbon writes that \"King Manuel theoretically abolished discrimination between Old and New Christians by the law of March 1, 1507 which permitted the departure of New Christians to any part of the Christian world, declaring that they 'be considered, favored and treated like the Old Christians and not distinct and separated from them in any matter.' Nevertheless, in apparent contradiction to that law, in a letter dated Almeirim, February 18, 1519, King Manuel promoted legislation henceforth prohibiting the naming of New Christians to the position of judge, town councilor or municipal registrar in Goa, stipulating, however, that those already appointed were not to be dismissed. This shows that even during the first nine years of Portuguese rule, Goa had a considerable influx of recently baptized Spanish and Portuguese Jews\" There are even examples of well-positioned Portuguese Jews, and New Christians, leaving the Portuguese administration to work with the Muslim sultanates of India in an attempt to strike back at Portugal for what it had done to them viz-a-viz the inquisition in Portugal. Moises Orfali of Bar-Ilan University writes that the initially Portuguese colonial and ecclesiastical authorities complained in very strong terms about Jewish influence in Goa. The Goa Inquisition which was established in 1560 was initiated by Jesuit Priest Francis Xavier from his headquarters in Malacca due to his inability to reanimate the faith of the New Christians there, Goa and in the region who had returned to Judaism. Goa became the headquarters of the Inquisition in Asia.\n\nCochin was, and still is, home to an ancient Jewish community (the Cochin Jews). Sephardic Jews from Iberia joined this community and became known as Paradesi Jews or \"White Jews\" (as opposed to older community which came to be known as the \"Malabari Jews\" or \"Black Jews\"). Cochin also attracted New Christians. In his lecture at the Library of Congress, Professor Sanjay Subrahmanyam of University of California, Los Angeles explains that New Christians came to India for economic opportunities (the Spice trade, the Golconda Diamonds trade, etc) and because India had well-established Jewish communities which allowed them the opportunity to rejoin the Jewish world.\n\nAs explained by Professor Fischel, the Sephardic Jews of London were active in trading out of Fort St. George, India which later developed into the city of Madras, and is known today as Chennai and during the early years, the city council was required to have three Jewish aldermen to represent the community's interests.\n\nMalacca, Malaysia was in the 16th century a Jewish hub – not only for Portuguese Jews but also for Jews from the middle east and the Malabar. With its synagogues and rabbis, Jewish culture in Malacca was alive and well. Visible Jewish presence (Dutch Jews) existed in Malacca right up to the 18th century. Due to the inquisition a lot of the Jews of Malacca were either captured or assimilated into the Malacca-Portuguese (Eurasian) community where they continued to live as New Christians. Malacca was the headquarters of Jesuit priest Francis Xavier and it was his discovery of the conversos from Portugal there who had openly returned to Judaism as in the fortresses of India that became the turning point and from whence he wrote to King John III of Portugal to start the inquisition in the East. Prominent Malaccan Jewish figures include Portuguese Rabbi Manoel Pinto, who was persecuted by the Goa Inquisition in 1573 and Duarte Fernandes a former Jewish tailor who had fled Portugal to escape the Inquisition who became the first European to establish diplomatic relations with Thailand.\n\nMost Spanish and Portuguese synagogues are, like those of the Italian and Romaniote Jews, characterised by a bipolar layout, with the \"tebáh\" bimah) near the opposite wall to the \"Hechál\" (Torah ark). The Hekhál has its \"parochet\" (curtain) inside its doors, rather than outside. The sefarim (Torah scrolls) are usually wrapped in a very wide mantle, quite different from the cylindrical mantles used by most Ashkenazi Jews. \"Tikim,\" wooden or metal cylinders around the \"sefarim,\" are typically not used. These were reportedly used, however, by the Portuguese Jewish community in Hamburg.\n\nThe most important synagogues, or \"esnogas\", as they are usually called amongst Spanish and Portuguese Jews, are the Portuguese Synagogue of Amsterdam and those in London and New York. Amsterdam is still the historical centre of the Amsterdam \"minhag\", as used in the Netherlands and former Dutch possessions such as Surinam. Also important is the Bevis Marks Synagogue in London, the historical centre of the London \"minhag\". The Curaçao synagogue (built in 1732 and known as the \"Snoa\", the Papiamento form of \"esnoga\") of the \"Mikvé Israel-Emanuel\" congregation is considered one of the most important synagogues in the Jewish history of the Americas.\n\nSince the late 20th century, many \"esnogas\" or synagogues in the Iberian Peninsula have been discovered by archaeologists and restored by both private and governmental efforts. In particular, the synagogues of Girona, Spain and Tomar, Portugal have been impressively restored to their former grandeur, if not their former social importance. (See the article Synagogue of Tomar.) Both Spain and Portugal have recently made efforts to reach out to descendants of Jews who were expelled from the peninsula in the 15th century, inviting them to apply for citizenship.\n\n\"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\" typically spoke both Spanish and Portuguese in their Early Modern forms. This is in contrast to the languages spoken by Eastern Sephardim and North African Sephardim, which were archaic Old Spanish derived Judaeo-Spanish dialects of Judaeo-Spanish (\"Ladino\") and Haketia (a mixture of Old Spanish, Hebrew, and Aramaic, plus various other languages depending on the area of their settlement). Their Early Modern languages also differ from modern Spanish and Portuguese, as spoken by Sephardic Bnei Anusim of Iberia and Ibero-America, including some recent returnees to Judaism in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.\n\nThe use of Spanish and Portuguese languages by Western Sephardim persists in parts of the synagogue service. Otherwise, the use of Spanish and Portuguese quickly diminished amongst the Spanish and Portuguese Jews after the 17th century, when they were adapting to new societies.\n\nIn practice, from the mid-19th century on, the Spanish and Portuguese Jews gradually replaced their traditional languages with the local ones of their places of residence for their everyday use. Local languages used by \"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\" include Dutch in the Netherlands and Belgium, Low German in the Altona, Hamburg area, and English in Great Britain, Ireland, Jamaica, and the United States.\n\nIn Curaçao, Spanish and Portuguese Jews contributed to the formation of Papiamento, a creole of Portuguese and various African languages. It is still used as an everyday language on the island.\n\nSpanish and Portuguese Jews who have migrated to Latin America since the late 20th century have generally adopted modern standard Latin American varieties of Spanish as their mother tongue.\n\nBecause of the relatively high proportion of immigrants through Portugal, the majority of Spanish and Portuguese Jews of the 16th and 17th centuries spoke Portuguese as their first language. Portuguese was used for everyday communication in the first few generations, and was the usual language for official documents such as synagogue by-laws; for this reason, synagogue officers still often have Portuguese titles such as \"Parnas dos Cautivos\" and \"Thesoureiro do Heshaim\". As a basic academic language, Portuguese was used for such works as the halakhic manual \"Thesouro dos Dinim\" by Menasseh Ben Israel and controversial works by Uriel da Costa.\n\nPortuguese is used – sometimes purely, other times in a mixture with Spanish and Hebrew – in connection with announcements of mitsvot in the \"esnoga\", in connection with the Mi shebberakh prayer etc. In London, for example, mitsvot are announced using Portuguese designations for the different roles played: for example, for lifting up or unwrapping the first or second Sefer Torah, \"que levantara/desenfaxara o primeiro/secundo sefer Torah\"), whereas in New York these roles are instead announced in Hebrew. On Kol Nidre in London, the announcement of the order of who is to carry the Sefarim forms part of a Portuguese declaration beginning \"a ordem dos Sefarim de esta noite\". These Portuguese phrases are generally pronounced phonetically according to the spelling as interpreted by a Spanish speaker, rather than as a Portuguese speaker would, though a recording of the correct Portuguese pronunciation was made for the use of the Amsterdam community.\n\nThe Judaeo-Portuguese dialect was preserved in some documents, but has not been used in everyday speech and is considered extinct since the late 18th century: for example, Portuguese ceased to be a spoken language in Holland in the Napoleonic period, when Jewish schools were allowed to teach only in Dutch and Hebrew. Sermons in Bevis Marks Synagogue were preached in Portuguese till 1830, when English was substituted. Judaeo-Portuguese has had some influence on the Judeo-Italian language of Livorno, known as \"Bagitto\".\n\nCastilian Spanish was used as the everyday language by those who came directly from Spain in the first few generations. Those who came from Portugal regarded it as their literary language, as did the Portuguese at that time. Relatively soon, the Castilian \"Ladino\" took on a semi-sacred status (\"Ladino\", in this context, simply means literal translation from Hebrew: it should not be confused with the Judaeo-Spanish used by Balkan, Greek and Turkish Sephardim.) Works of theology as well as \"reza books\" (siddurim) were written in Castilian rather than in Portuguese; while, even in works written in Portuguese such as the \"Thesouro dos Dinim\", quotations from the Bible or the prayer book were usually given in Spanish. Members of the Amsterdam community continued to use Spanish as a literary language. They established clubs and libraries for the study of modern Spanish literature, such as the \"Academia de los Sitibundos\" (founded 1676) and the \"Academia de los Floridos\" (1685).\n\nIn England the use of Spanish and Portuguese continued until the early 19th century: In 1740 Haham Isaac Nieto produced a new translation into contemporary Spanish of the prayers for the New Year and Yom Kippur, and in 1771 a translation of the daily, Sabbath and Festival prayers. There was an unofficial translation into English in 1771 by A. Alexander and others by David Levi in 1789 and following years, but the Prayer Books were first officially translated into English in 1836, by \"hakham\" David de Aaron de Sola. Today Spanish and Portuguese Jews in England have little tradition of using Spanish, except for the hymn \"Bendigamos\", the translation of the Biblical passages in the prayer-book for Tisha B'Av, and in certain traditional greetings.\n\nThe Hebrew of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews from the 19th century and 20th century is characterised primarily by the pronunciation of (Beth rafé) as a hard \"b\" (\"e.g.\", \"Abrahám, Tebáh, Habdaláh\") and the pronunciation of (ʿAyin) as a voiced velar nasal (\"Shemang, Ngalénu\"). The hard pronunciation of Beth Rafé differs from the \"v\" pronunciation of Moroccan Jews and the Judaeo-Spanish Jews of the Balkans, but is shared by Algerian and Syrian Jews. The nasal pronunciation of 'Ayin is shared with traditional Italian pronunciation (where it can be either \"ng\" or \"ny\"), but not with any other Sephardi groups. Both these features are declining, under the influence of hazzanim from other communities and of Israeli Hebrew.\n\nThe sibilants , , and are all transcribed as \"s\" in earlier sources. This, along with the traditional spellings \"Sabá\" (Shabbat), \"Menasseh\" (Menashe), \"Ros(as)anáh\" (Rosh Hashana), \"Sedacáh\" (tzedaka), \"massoth\" (matzot), is evidence of a traditional pronunciation which did not distinguish between the various sibilants—a trait which is shared with some coastal dialects of Moroccan Hebrew. Since the 19th century, the pronunciations (for and [ts] for have become common—probably by influence from Oriental Sephardic immigrants, from Ashkenazi Hebrew and, in our times, Israeli Hebrew.\n\nThe (taw rafé) is pronounced like \"t\" in all traditions of Spanish and Portuguese Jews today, although the consistent transliteration as \"th\" in 17th-century sources may suggest an earlier differentiation of and . (Final is occasionally heard as \"d\".)\n\nIn Dutch-speaking areas, but not elsewhere, (gimel) is often pronounced like Dutch \"g\". More careful speakers use this sound for \"gimel rafé\" (gimel without dagesh), while pronouncing \"gimel\" with dagesh as .\n\nDutch Sephardim take care to pronounce he with mappiq as a full \"h\", usually repeating the vowel: \"vi-yamlich malchutéh\".\n\nThe accentuation of Hebrew adheres strictly to the rules of Biblical Hebrew, including the secondary stress on syllables with a long vowel before a shva. Also, the shvá nang in the beginning of a word is normally pronounced as a short \"eh\" (\"Shemang, berít, berakháh\"). Shva nang is also normally pronounced after a long vowel with secondary stress (\"ngomedím, barekhú\"). However it is not pronounced after a prefixed \"u-\" (and): \"ubne\", not \"u-bene\".\n\nVocal shva, segol (short e) and tzere (long e) are all pronounced like the 'e' in \"bed\": there is no distinction except in length. In some communities, e.g. Amsterdam, vocal shva is pronounced when marked with \"gangya\" (a straight line next to the vowel symbol, equivalent to meteg), and as when followed by the letter yodh: thus \"va-nashubah\" and \"bi-yom\" (but \"be-Yisrael\").\n\nThe differentiation between kamatz gadol and kamatz katan is made according to purely phonetic rules without regard to etymology, which occasionally leads to spelling pronunciations at variance with the rules laid down in the grammar books. For example, (all), when unhyphenated, is pronounced \"kal\" rather than \"kol\" (in \"kal ngatsmotai\" and \"Kal Nidre\"), and (noon) is pronounced \"tsahorayim\" rather than \"tsohorayim\". This feature is shared by other Sephardic groups, but is not found in Israeli Hebrew. It is also found in the transliteration of proper names in the King James Version such as Naomi, Aholah and Aholibah.\n\nAlthough all Sephardic liturgies are similar, each group has its own distinct liturgy. Many of these differences are a product of the syncretization of the Spanish liturgy and the liturgies of the local communities where Spanish exiles settled. Other differences are the result of earlier regional variations in liturgy from pre-expulsion Spain. Moses Gaster (died 1939, Hakham of the S&P Jews of Great Britain) has shown that the order of prayers used by Spanish and Portuguese Jews has its origin in the Castilian liturgy of Pre-Expulsion Spain.\n\nAs compared with other Sephardic groups, the minhag of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews is characterised by a relatively low number of cabbalistic additions. The Friday night service thus traditionally starts with Psalm 29, \"Mizmor leDavid: Habu LaA.”. In the printed siddurim of the mid-17th century, “Lekhah Dodi\" and the Mishnaic passage \"Bammeh madlikin\" are also not yet included, but these are included in all newer siddurim of the tradition except for the early West London and Mickve Israel (Savannah) Reform prayerbooks, both of which have Spanish and Portuguese roots.\n\nOf other, less conspicuous, elements, a number of archaic forms can be mentioned—including some similarities with the Italian and Western Ashkenazi traditions. Such elements include the shorter form of the Birkat hammazon which can be found in the older Amsterdam and Hamburg/Scandinavian traditions. The Livorno (Leghorn) tradition, however, includes many of the cabbalistic additions found in most other Sephardi traditions. The current London minhag is generally close to the Amsterdam minhag, but follows the Livorno tradition in some details—most notably in the Birkat hammazon.\n\nOne interesting feature of the tradition (at least in New York and Philadelphia) is that, when reading the haftarah on Simhat Torah and Shabbat Bereshit, the Hatan Torah and Hatan Bereshit chant two extra verses pertaining to bridegrooms from Isaiah 61:10 and 62:5 at the end of the standard haftarot for the days themselves. This seems to be a unique remnant of the old tradition of reading Isaiah 61:10–63:9 if a bridegroom who had been married the previous week was present in synagogue.\n\nThe ritual music of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews differs from other Sephardic music in that it is influenced by Western European Baroque and Classical music to a relatively high degree. Not only in Spanish and Portuguese communities, but in many others in southern France and northern Italy, it was common to commission elaborate choral compositions, often including instrumental music, for the dedication of a synagogue, for family events such as weddings and circumcisions and for festivals such as Hoshana Rabbah, on which the halachic restriction on instrumental music did not apply.\n\nAlready in 1603, the sources tell us that harpsichords were used in the Spanish and Portuguese synagogues in Hamburg. Particularly in the Amsterdam community, but to some degree also in Hamburg and elsewhere, there was a flourishing of Classical music in the synagogues in the 18th century. There was formerly a custom in Amsterdam, inspired by a hint in the \"Zohar\", of holding an instrumental concert on Friday afternoon prior to the coming in of the Shabbat, as a means of getting the congregants in the right mood for the Friday night service. An important Jewish composer was Abraham Caceres; music was also commissioned from non-Jewish composers such as Cristiano Giuseppe Lidarti, some of which is still used.\n\nThe same process took place in Italy, where the Venetian community commissioned music from non-Jewish composers such as Carlo Grossi and Benedetto Marcello.\n\nAnother important centre for Spanish and Portuguese Jewish music was Livorno, where a rich cantorial tradition developed, incorporating both traditional Sephardic music from around the Mediterranean and composed art music: this was in turn disseminated to other centres.\n\nIn the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, in particular in Italy at the time of the Italian unification, hazzanim sometimes doubled as opera singers, and some liturgical compositions from this period reflect this operatic character.\n\nAlready in the 17th century, choirs were used in the service on holidays in the Amsterdam community: this choir still exists and is known as \"Santo Serviço\". This custom was introduced in London in the early 19th century. In most cases, the choirs have consisted only of men and boys, but in Curaçao, the policy was changed to allow women in the choir (in a separate section) in 1863.\n\nThere are early precedents for the use of instrumental music in the synagogue originating in 17th century Italy as well as the Spanish and Portuguese communities of Hamburg and Amsterdam and in the Ashkenazic community of Prague. As in most other communities the use of instrumental music is not permitted on Shabbat or festivals.\n\nAs a general rule, Spanish and Portuguese communities do not use pipe organs or other musical instruments during services. In some Spanish and Portuguese communities, notably in France (Bordeaux, Bayonne), US (Savannah, Georgia, Charleston, South Carolina, Richmond, Virginia) and the Caribbean (Curaçao), pipe organs came into use during the course of the 19th century, in parallel with developments in Reform Judaism. In Curaçao, where the traditional congregation had an organ set up in the late 19th century, the use of the organ on Shabbat was eventually also accepted, as long as the organ player was not Jewish. In the more traditional congregations, such as London and New York, a free-standing organ or electric piano is used at weddings or benot mitzvah (although never on Shabbat or Yom Tob), in the same way as in some English Ashkenazi synagogues.\n\nThe cantorial style of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews adheres to the general Sephardi principle that every word is sung out loud and that most of the ritual is performed communally rather than solistically (although nowadays in the New York community, the Pesukei dezimra (\"zemirot\") throughout the year, Hallél on festivals or the new moon, and several of the selichot during Yom Kippur are chanted in a manner more similar to the Ashkenazi practice of reading only the first and last few verses of each paragraph aloud). The hazzan's rôle is typically one of guiding the congregation rather than being a soloist. Thus, there is traditionally a much stronger emphasis on correct diction and knowledge of the musical minhág than on the solistic voice quality. In the parts of the service where the ḥazzán would traditionally have a more solistic rôle, the basic melodies are embellished according to the general principles of Baroque performance practice: for example, after a prayer or hymn sung by the congregation, the ḥazzán often repeats the last line in a highly elaborated form. Two- and three-part harmony is relatively common, and Edwin Seroussi has shown that the harmonies are a reflection of more complex, four-part harmonies in written sources from the 18th century.\n\nThe recitative style of the central parts of the service, such as the Amidah, the Psalms and the cantillation of the Torah is loosely related to that of other Sephardi and Mizraḥi communities, though there is no formal maqam system as used by most of these. The closest resemblance is to the rituals of Gibraltar and Northern Morocco, as Spanish and Portuguese communities traditionally recruited their ḥazzanim from these countries. There is a remoter affinity with the Babylonian and North African traditions: these are more conservative than the Syrian and Judaeo-Spanish (Balkan, Greek, Turkish) traditions, which have been more heavily influenced by popular Mediterranean, Turkish and Arabic music.\n\nIn other parts of the service, and in particular on special occasions such as the festivals, Shabbat Bereshit and the anniversary of the founding of the synagogue, the traditional tunes are often replaced by metrical and harmonized compositions in the Western European style. This is not the case on Rosh Hashanah and Kippúr (Yom Kippur), when the whole service has a far more archaic character.\n\nA characteristic feature of Oriental Sephardic music is the transposition of popular hymn tunes (themselves sometimes derived from secular songs) to important prayers such as \"Nishmat\" and \"Kaddish\". This occurs only to a limited extent in the Spanish and Portuguese ritual: such instances as exist can be traced to the book of hymns \"Imre no'am\" (1628), published in Amsterdam by Joseph Gallego, a hazzan originating in Salonica. Certain well-known tunes, such as \"El nora aliláh\" and \"Ahhot ketannáh\", are shared with Sephardi communities worldwide with small variations.\n\nSpanish and Portuguese traditional cantillation has several unique elements. \"Torah\" cantillation is divided into two musical styles. The first is the standard used for all regular readings. A similar but much more elaborate manner of cantillation is used on special occasions. This is normally referred to as \"High Tangamim\" or \"High Na'um\". It is used for special portions of the Torah reading, principally the Ten Commandments but also Chapter 1 of Bereshit (on Simchat Torah), the \"Shirat ha-Yam\", the Song of Moses, the concluding sentences of each of the five books and several other smaller portions.\n\nSpanish and Portuguese Torah cantillation has been notated several times since the 17th century. The melodies now in use, particularly in London, show some changes from the earlier notated versions and a degree of convergence with the Iraqi melody.\n\nThe rendition of the Haftarah (prophetic portion) also has two (or three) styles. The standard, used for most \"haftarot\", is nearly identical with that of the Moroccan \"nusach\". A distinctly more somber melody is used for the three \"haftarot\" preceding the ninth of Ab (the \"three weeks\".) On the morning of the Ninth of Ab a third melody is used for the Haftarah—although this melody is borrowed from the melody for the Book of Ruth.\n\nThere is a special melody used for the Book of Esther: in London it is a cantillation system in the normal sense, while in New York and Amsterdam it is chant-like and does not depend on the Masoretic symbols. The books of Ruth, read on Shavuot, and Lamentations, read on the Ninth of Ab, have their own cantillation melodies as well. There is no tradition of reading Ecclesiastes.\n\nMost Spanish and Portuguese communities have no tradition of liturgical reading of the \"Shir haShirim\" (Song of Songs), unlike Ashkenazim who read it on Pesach and Oriental Sephardim who read it on Friday nights. However in the two weeks preceding Pesach a passage consisting of selected verses from that book is read each day at the end of the morning service. The chant is similar but not identical to the chant for Shir haShirim in the Moroccan tradition, but does not exactly follow the printed cantillation marks. A similar chant is used for the prose parts of the book of Job on the Ninth of Ab.\n\nThere is no cantillation mode for the books of Psalms, Proverbs and the poetic parts of Job. The chant for the Psalms in the Friday night service has some resemblance to the cantillation mode of the Oriental traditions, but is not dependent on the cantillation marks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since 1988, Chan has been a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and also supports the Japan Committee for UNICEF.\n\nAgnes Chan began singing and playing guitar in her junior high years in Hong Kong, as volunteer work for fundraising events. She had a chance to record a cover of Joni Mitchell's \"The Circle Game\" with her older sister, actress Irene Chan, and it became a hit song in Hong Kong. She became famous throughout southeast Asia through several of Chang Cheh's movies, including \"Young People\" and \"The Generation Gap\".\n\nChan's rendition of \"The Circle Game\" (1971) was totally different than Mitchell's, but very close to Buffy Sainte-Marie's 1968 version. It was/is misconstrued by many in Hong Kong that Chan was the original composer, whereas in her many Cantonese public interviews, she had yet to clarify by mentioning Mitchell or Sainte-Marie.\n\nJapanese singer/songwriter Masaaki Hirao brought Chan to Japan, and in 1972 she recorded her first Japanese pop hit, \"Poppy Flower (ひなげしの花).\" Her clear voice, pretty looks, and imperfect Japanese made her a teenage idol. In 1973 her third single, \"Splendor in the Grass (草原の輝き),\" earned her the Japan Record Grand Prix \"Rookie of the Year\" award. She graduated from The American School in Japan in 1973.\n\nIn 1973 she first appeared on Kōhaku Uta Gassen (with \"Poppy Flower (ひなげしの花)\"), and subsequently made two more consecutive appearances on the show. \n\nChan enrolled in Tokyo's Sophia University and studied for two years, after which she decided to take a break from the entertainment business and study social child psychology at the University of Toronto in Canada.\n\nAfter graduating in 1978, Chan returned to Japan to resume her singing career. Her first Cantonese album was released in Hong Kong in 1979. She won a prize for her peace thesis for International Youth Year 1984. Her first concert in China, a benefit for Soong Ching-ling's children's fund, was held in 1985 at Beijing's capital gym for an audience of 54,000.\n\nChan's 1984 visit to Ethiopia during a drastic drought and food shortage was covered for the Nippon Television Network's annual \"24-Hour TV\" charity special. Through these events, she resumed her volunteer work as she continued her entertainment career.\n\nIn 1986, Chan married her former manager, Tsutomu Kaneko, and gave birth to her eldest son in Canada. When she returned to Japan the next year she would bring her infant along to the workplace, which was seen as highly controversial (\"Agnes\" became something of a buzzword in Japan) and raised the question of a mother's place in the working world.\n\nIn 1989 Chan began studying with Stanford University's department of education. With Myra H. Strober, she investigated the situations of 10 graduates from Tokyo University and Stanford 10 years after their graduation. This showed significant differences between the men and women of Japan and the US, and earned Chan her PhD. Chan returned to Japan as a lecturer, essayist, and university professor.\n\nIn 1998, Chan was appointed the first ambassador of the Japan Committee for UNICEF, established as an independent local non-governmental organisation in Japan, under agreement with UNICEF.\n\nChan's education had a profound impact on her singing career: by 2000 her recordings had taken a darker, moodier tone.\n\nIn 2002, Chan began her work as a novelist with \"Perfect Couple\" and \"Bullet Ring\".\n\nChan released her first self-cover single, \"Splendor in the Grass 2005 (草原の輝き2005),\" in 2005, and Asahi beverage used the song in an herbal-tea commercial. Chan's latest single is \"Flower of Happiness (しあわせの花)\". In October she won the 14th \"Pestalozzi Education Award\" presented by Hiroshima University.\n\nHer new English-language album \"Forget Yourself\", including a duet with legendary Chinese performer Jackie Chan, was released in the United States in February 2006.\n\nChan is planning to release three new Japanese singles and make an album during 2007; she also plans to perform 35th-anniversary concerts in 100 Japanese cities and Beijing, China in 2007 and 2008.\n\nIn October 2007 it was reported that Chan had undergone breast-cancer surgery in a Tokyo hospital, and is expected to make a full recovery.\n\nShe is a Roman Catholic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its motto, inspired by Henri de la Rochejaquelein, is: \"If I advance, follow me. If I stop, urge me on. If I retreat, kill me.\"\n\nOn 5 December 1974, Guatemala's military government created its Commando School (\"Escuela de Comandos\"). Three months later it renamed it the Kaibil Special Operations Training Centre (\"Centro de Adiestramiento y Operaciones Especiales Kaibil\"). The name \"Kaibil\" is derived from Kayb'il B'alam (\"Kaibil Balam\"), a Mam indigenous leader who evaded capture by the Spanish conquistadors under Pedro de Alvarado.\n\nInitially, the Kaibil Centre was located on two estates, \"El Infierno\" (\"Hell\") and \"La Pólvora\" (\"Gunpowder\") in the municipality of Melchor de Mencos, Petén department. On 12 January 1989, it was moved to the former headquarters of Military Zone 23, in Poptún, Petén.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Defence, the Kaibil Centre's mission is to train and develop elite commando forces: \"To select, by means of arduous, difficult training under physical and mental pressure, members of the army capable of engaging in commando operations.\"\n\nRecruitment is voluntary. However, several physical and psychological tests are required before entering. The training is given twice a year and lasts 60 days. Only 64 participants are allowed per training period, not older than 28 years of age. No more than 10 have graduated on a single period. Members of foreign military forces are sometimes selected to participate in training.\nThe commandos are trained in guerrilla warfare, counter-guerrilla operations, military behaviour, map reading, psychological preparation, military intelligence and counter-intelligence. Their training includes a special hand-to-hand combat system known as \"Temv-K'a\" (which means \"Hands of Storm\"), communications, survival techniques, obstacle courses, military hiking, special weapons, demolitions and emergency medical training. This includes aerial operations, day and night navigation, camp setup and security, evasion, escape, interventions and ambushes.\n\nTraining is extremely physically and mentally demanding, and takes place during both daytime and nighttime. Sleep is permitted for no longer than three hours a day, but only if the right is earned. The right to eat must also be earned; before being allowed to eat, soldiers must successfully climb a rope, do five pull-ups, ten push-ups and run two miles in 18 minutes or less wearing full combat gear, then duck walk to the mess hall, after which they are given 30 seconds to eat.\n\nThe first stage of training, which lasts 21 days, consists of theory instructions and practical military training, where the military and morale levels of a candidate are tested. It is followed by hard military training in the jungle, which includes instruction in jungle warfare as well as demolition and detection and deactivation of landmines, scuba diving, waterborne operations, construction of improvised training, SERE training, basic air mobile techniques, small-unit patrols, react to contact, and ambush training. In addition, cadets are exposed to prisoner of war camp situations and survival courses. During the last stage, they are trained to eat \"anything that moves\", including snakes and ants, as well as roots, to collect dew drops from leaves, as well as how to execute annihilation attacks, intelligence maneuvers, and penetration into enemy territory. During this stage, candidates must patrol through thorn-filled brush wearing nothing but underwear, roll around in thorns to fortify the body to pain, and spend two days in neck-deep water without sleeping in extreme tropical heat. This stage is called \"El Infierno\" (\"Hell\").\n\nDuring training, every soldier has a \"cuaz\" (which in Q'eqchi' means: \"Brother\") assigned for the rest of their training. They become partners: they sleep, eat, and work together all the time. If one makes a mistake, they are both punished for it.\n\nThe Kaibiles are infamous for their reputed practice of forcing recruits to kill animals, which includes raising a puppy and bonding with it before killing and eating it, as well as biting the heads off live chickens. In addition, recruits are shot and forced to perform field surgery on themselves, and to drink water out of recently fired artillery shells. As part of the course's finishing ritual, every recruit must drink \"Bomb\", a mix of tequila, whisky, rum, beer, water and gunpowder, served in a bamboo glass with a bayonet tied to it. Soldiers must drink it carefully, so as not to get drunk and cut themselves with the bayonet. Once they successfully complete this ritual, they are inducted into the Kaibiles.\n\nEven though in the past they were meant to be an anti-guerrilla unit, today they are oriented towards anti-terrorism, anti-kidnapping and anti-narcotics efforts, in line with current needs.\n\nIn February 1999, the Commission for Historical Clarification (\"Comisión para el Esclaracimiento Histórico\", CEH), the truth and reconciliation body established under United Nations auspices by the 1996 Peace Accords that brought an end to the country's 35-year-long Civil War, called attention to the brutalising nature of the training conducted by the Kaibil Centre in its final report, \"Guatemala: Memoria del silencio\" (\"Guatemala: Memory of Silence\"):\n\nThe substantiation of the degrading contents of the training of the Army's special counter insurgency force, known as Kaibiles, has drawn the particular attention of the CEH. This training included killing animals and then eating them raw and drinking their blood in order to demonstrate courage. The extreme cruelty of these training methods, according to testimony available to the CEH, was then put into practice in a range of operations carried out by these troops, confirming one point of their decalogue: \"The Kaibil is a killing machine.\" (CEH, §42)\n\nThe Commission's report documented examples of massacres of civilians by the Kaibiles, most notably the December 1982 Dos Erres massacre.\n\nIn December 1996, shortly before the signing of the Peace Accords, President Álvaro Arzú spoke of his intention to preserve the Kaibiles in peacetime but to rededicate them to another war: the war on narcotics and crime. Addressing a Kaibil graduation ceremony in Poptún, he said: \"Now this new army of peace will face an enemy that perhaps is much more powerful than the one we faced for many years. We are talking of drug traffickers and criminals who want to corrode the country; they are better armed, equipped, and trained than the enemies we had to face in the past.\" However, under the terms of the Peace Accords, the army was to have been restricted to defence from external attack, which would preclude involvement in the sort of domestic police actions proposed by President Arzú.\n\nThe Kaibiles' record and reputation led the Roman Catholic Church's Interdiocese Project for the Recovery of Historical Memory (\"Proyecto Interdiocesano de Recuperación de la Memoria Histórica\", REMHI) to recommend that the group be disbanded in its April 1998 report, \"Guatemala: Never Again\" (\"Guatemala: Nunca Más\").\n\nAccording to \"Jane's Intelligence Review\" \"The army has refused to disband the Special Forces Training and Operations Centre, housed at El Infierno, in the vicinity of Poptún, Petén.\" In December 1998, Jane's reported that there were three groups of Kaibiles, one consisting of instructors, and two consisting of 162 commandos apiece. Each group was divided into four 38-men platoons, further subdivided into squads of 9 soldiers.\n\nCurrently there are Kaibiles stationed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as part of the United Nations MONUSCO peacekeeping force. On 23 January 2006, a unit of 80 Kaibiles failed in an attempt to capture Vincent Otti, the deputy commander of Uganda's Lord's Resistance Army, in Congo's Garamba National Park. Eight Kaibiles and at least fifteen guerrillas were killed in the resulting gunfight.\n\nMore recently, it has been alleged, that some former members of the Kaibiles have formed relationships with the Los Zetas mercenary group. Los Zetas are a group of elite Mexican paratroopers and intelligence operatives who deserted their Special Air Mobile Force Group in 1999 and have since been hired as \"enforcers\" by the drugs traffickers of the Gulf Cartel. However, Los Zetas now operates as an independent organization since its rupture from the Gulf Cartel in early 2010.\n\n\nThe first version of this article was modified and edited from Guatemala: Kaibiles and the Massacre at Las Dos Erres, a public domain (dead link) information request response document of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\n"}
{"id": "2233967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233967", "title": "Luigi Cornaro", "text": "Luigi Cornaro\n\nAlvise Cornaro, often Italianised Luigi (1467 or 1464 – 8 May 1566), was a Venetian nobleman and patron of arts, also remembered for his four books of \"Discorsi\" (published 1583–95) about the secrets to living long and well with measure and sobriety.\nBorn in Padua, the son of an innkeeper, who claimed a connection to the noble Cornaro family of Venice, a connection he was at pains to prove, Cornaro expanded a modest stake from his mother's brother into a fortune based on his entrepreneurial skills, especially in hydraulics that reclaimed wetlands for farming, expressed in his \"Tratto di Acque\" (\"Tract on Water management\") of 1566.\nAs a patron, Cornaro sat to Tintoretto for his portrait and guided the career of the Veronese artist-architect Giovanni Maria Falconetto, whose Loggia and Odeo Cornaro (1524) for Alvise's then suburban garden in Padua was an early Renaissance-style building in the Veneto. As financial advisor to the Bishop of Padua, he secured for Falconetto the commission to design the Villa dei Vescovi (\"Villa of the Bishops\") at Luvigliano, in the Eugaean Hills, as well as his own Villa Cornaro in Este. Later in life, from about 1538, Cornaro was acquainted with the young mason who was to become Andrea Palladio. Cornaro's own views on architecture are expressed in his \"Trattato dell'architettura\" (\"Treatise on Architecture\"). Cornaro constructed two theatres, the \"Odeo Cornaro\" in Padua and another in the gardens of his villa at Este.\n\nWhen he was about 40, Cornaro found himself exhausted and in poor health, a condition he attributed to a hedonistic lifestyle with excessive eating, drinking, and sexual licentiousness. On the advice of doctors, he began to adhere to a calorie restriction diet specially for morbid obese/anorexia nervosa persons, centered on the \"quantifying principle\" of restricting himself to only 350g of food daily (including bread, egg yolk, meat, and soup) and 414 mL of wine. His book \"Discorsi della vita sobria\" (Discourses On the Temperate Life), which described his regimen, was extremely successful, and \"was a true reconceptualization of old age. As late as the Renaissance it was largely the negative aspects of this phase of life which were emphasized ... Cornaro’s method offered the possibility for the first time not only of a long but also a worthwhile life.\" After his conversion to a holistic lifestyle, he remained in vigorous health well into old age.\n\nIn 1550, when Cornaro was about 83, he was urged to write down his secrets of health, and its English translation, often referred to today under the title \"The Sure and Certain Method of Attaining a Long and Healthful Life\", went through numerous editions; he wrote three follow-ups in 1553, 1558, and 1562. The first three were published at Padua in 1558. They are written, says Joseph Addison, in the early 18th century periodical \"The Spectator\" (No. 195), \"with such a spirit of cheerfulness, religion and good sense, as are the natural concomitants of temperance and sobriety.\" Friedrich Nietzsche criticized the work for \"mistaking the consequence with the cause,\" insisting that Cornaro's diet is not the cause of his long life, but rather that the cause of his long life - which Nietzsche gives as his slow metabolism - is the reason for his diet.\n\nCornaro maintained that longevity was desirable and \"God wills it\". He rejected ascetics who believed man must suffer in this life to attain salvation in the next, arguing that there was no reason one could not enjoy both his earthly existence and his heavenly one. In addition, he rejected conventional wisdom that old age was a period of misery and decay, writing \"And now some sensual and unreasonable individuals pretend that the existence of a man after he passes the age of 65 cannot be termed a living one, but a dead one. I will plainly demonstrate that they are mistaken, for I have a desire that all men should attain my age, which is the most beautiful period of life.\" He also commented that at the age of 83, his health was good, he could perform most functions unassisted, and he had a wide circle of younger friends and correspondents. Cornaro also firmly condemned those with a live-fast-and-die-young mentality, stating that \"They don't stop and consider the virtue of ten more years of active life, at a point where we've reached a high point of experience and wisdom, two things that can only be honed with time.\"\n\nHe died at Padua at age 98, according to his birth and death date in the 1911 \"Encyclopædia Britannica\"; other sources give his age at death as 102.\n\nIn the work known as \"Illustrissimi\", a collection of letters written by Pope John Paul I when he was Patriarch of Venice, Cornaro serves as one of the \"recipients\" of the letters. There are 40 letters in all, mainly to people in Italian history and fiction, but also to internationally well known fictional and historical characters such as Pinocchio, Charles Dickens, Hippocrates, and Jesus.\n\n"}

Walter Thompson advertising agency and a pioneer of many advertising techniques.\n\nHe was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts on October 28, 1847.\n\nIn 1864, William James Carlton started selling advertising space in religious magazines. The agency was called Carlton and Smith, although almost nothing is known about the Smith partner. In 1868, Carlton hired Thompson as a bookkeeper. Eventually Thompson found that soliciting and sales were much more profitable and he became a very effective salesman for the small company. In 1877, Thompson bought the agency for $500 and renamed it \"J. Walter Thompson Company\". Thompson paid $800 for the Carlton and Smith furniture in the same transaction.\n\nRealizing that he could sell more space if the company provided the service of developing content for advertisers, Thompson hired writers and artists to form the first known creative department in an advertising agency. He is credited as the \"father of modern magazine advertising\" in the United States.\n\nThompson, having served on the USS \"Saratoga\" in the Civil War, was a passionate sailor. He owned a variety of vessels, including a seagoing houseboat, a steam, (Stella). He headed the New York Yacht Club, for which his title as Commodore and his portrait became famous within the company. He lived at 11 East Sixty-eighth Street in Manhattan.\n\nHe developed the Roosevelt Manor section of Cranford in the 1890s and built the Cranford Opera House block in Cranford, New Jersey for his wife, Margaret Riggs Boyle Thompson, in 1892.\n\nThe J. Walter Thompson Company was incorporated in 1896. In 1899, Thompson opened an office in London. An avid traveler, Thompson went abroad nearly every summer for twenty years, and rarely came back without important accounts. He saw New York as \"the flagship\" office for a company with no geographical restrictions. \"It has no limitations. Any spot on earth where goods are to be sold by advertising is inside the fence of the Thompson field\", said Thompson.\n\nIn 1900, JWT published a house ad explaining trademark advertising. This was the first known commercial explanation of what we now know as brand management. Thompson soon became known for his philosophy of drawing a straight line between the manufacturer and the consumer.\n\nIn 1916, Stanley B. Resor and several partners bought the company from the aging Thompson for $500,000.\n\nIn 1930, a letter addressed to Thompson arrived from soon-to-be president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, asking for a job for his son, Elliott, guaranteeing that \"he has a perfectly good mind\"; JWT’s mother was a distant cousin of FDR, but Thompson had died in 1928. Elliott never did work for JWT.\n\nThompson is responsible for some enduring brand images in popular culture, such as the Rock of Gibraltar used for the Prudential Insurance Company.\n\nToday, JWT is one of the largest advertising agencies in the United States and the fourth-largest in the world. It is one of the key companies of Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP Group (NASDAQ:WPPGY) and is headquartered in New York. The global agency is led by Worldwide Chairman and Global CEO Bob Jeffrey who took over the role in 1998. JWT was named Adweek magazine's 2009 \"Global Agency of the Year.\"\n\nThompson plays a minor role in Jack Finney's \"Time and Again\".\n"}

{"id": "2233992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233992", "title": "Social Christian Unity Party", "text": "Social Christian Unity Party\n\nThe Social Christian Unity Party (\"Partido Unidad Social Cristiana\") is a centre-right political party in Costa Rica.\n\nPUSC considers itself a Christian democratic party and, as such, is a member of the Christian Democrat Organization of America (ODCA). It was founded in 1983 by merger of the parties that were part of the Unity Coalition: the Christian Democratic, the Republican Calderonista, People's Union and the Democratic Renovation Party. Its historical roots are in \"Calderonism\", i.e. the movement of supporters of Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia, who was the country's president in the 1940s. From its foundation until 2006, the PUSC was one of Costa Rica's two dominant parties, alongside the National Liberation Party. It provided three presidents: Rafael Ángel Calderón Fournier (1990–94), Miguel Ángel Rodríguez (1998–2002) and Abel Pacheco (2002–06).\n\nNegotiations among the main right-wing opposition parties to create a political force capable of confronting the National Libertation Party (PLN) started as early as 1973. Yet, wasn’t until 1977 that four political parties; People's Union (liberal), Christian Democratic Party (Christian Democracy), Republican Calderonista (Calderonism) and Democratic Renovation (Social democracy) united forces in the Unity Coalition. After a primary election Rodrigo Carazo became the alliance's nominee gaining victory in the 1978 general election. The Coalition not only achieved the Presidency but also a non-PLN parliamentary majority for the first time since PLN's foundation. Yet, Carazo's administration was very unpopular due to the economic crisis and the tensions with neighbor Nicaragua due to Costa Rica's support of the rebel guerrilla FSLN. Thus, Rafael Ángel Calderón Fournier the Coalition's candidate in the 1982 general election suffered a debacle gaining only 33% of the votes and PLN obtaining a landslide victory. Even though, Unity remained as the second political force.\n\nOn December 17, 1983 the four parties merged in the Social Christian Unity Party, not without certain controversy especially among certain factions in the Democratic Renovation. Costa Rica's law required for every party in the coalition to merge in order to be valid and also to be able of receiving the so call “political debt” (State's contribution to parties after the election proportional to their electoral support). After a series of complex sessions, Democratic Renovation's National Assembly finally agree by a slight majority to merge and PUSC was born and Costa Rica passed from a dominant-party system into a two-party system with PLN and PUSC as main political forces.\n\nPUSC’ first primary was held on February 27, 1989. Calderón Fournier faces Miguel Ángel Rodríguez Calderón winning with 75% of the votes. Calderón, as son of Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia, the historical leader of Calderonism and the social reforms of the 40s, was seen as the most representative leader of PUSC, while Rodríguez came from the liberal faction inside the party. This division between liberals and calderonistas was going to survive for the rest of the Party's history.\n\nIn the 1990 election following that primary Calderón won over PLN's candidate Carlos Manuel Castillo. A second primary was held on June 1993 between Rodríguez and Juan José Trejos (son of former president José Joaquín Trejos), this time Rodríguez turned victorious with 75% but lost to PLN's candidate José María Figueres in 1994. With Rodríguez as candidate the party did won both Presidency and parliamentary majority in the 1998 election, this time without the need for primaries.\n\nNext primary was held on June 10, 2001 between then deputy and TV personality Dr. Abel Pacheco de la Espriella and former minister Rodolfo Mendez Mata. Even though Mata was endorsed by Calderón, Pacheco won the primary with 76% of the votes. Pacheco won the 2002 election over PLN's candidate Rolando Araya making it the first time a party other than PLN kept in power by two consecutive terms since 1948.\n\nIn 2004-2005 a series of corruption scandals involved three former presidents of Costa Rica; Rafael Ángel Calderón Fournier, Miguel Ángel Rodríguez Echeverría and José María Figueres Olsen. All of them suspects of bribery and enticement. They were accused of receiving money in exchange for guaranteeing very profitable contracts between private companies Alcatel and Fischel with State's corporations. The scandals even caused Calderón and Rodríguez to be arrested, prosecuted and in Calderón's case condemned, while Figueres wasn’t arrested as he was in a non-extraditable country. Rodríguez was acquitted on a technicality.\n\nThe party's candidate in 2006 right after the scandals was Pacheco's Prime Minister Ricardo Toledo. Toledo received only 3% of the votes, an unthinkable result for what was once one of Costa Rica's main parties. Anti-corruption party Citizens Action saw an increase in its support receiving almost as many votes as PLN and replacing PUSC as PLN's main rival. PUSC also passed from 17 to 5 seats after the 2006 parliamentary election and from 58 to 9 mayors in that year's municipal election.\n\nIn 2010 the party's nominee was former Vice President Luis Fishman. Fishman was the first Jewish presidential candidate in Costa Rica's history and gained 5% of the votes keeping the 5 seats. In 2013 Calderón suggested Dr. Rodolfo Hernández, then director of Costa Rica's Children's Hospital, as 2014's presidential nominee. Hernández faces former minister in Miguel Ángel Rodríguez’ cabinet Rodolfo Piza in the 2013 party primary showing, again, the traditional fight between the Calderonist and Liberal factions (the liberals having control over the National Committee). Also, as usual for a victorious candidate in PUSC's primaries, Hernández won with 75% of the votes.\n\nHernández received very good support and for a while was the second most popular candidate after PLN's Johnny Araya. Yet Hernández resigns as candidate on October 3, 2013 alleging constant backstabbing and treacheries from PUSC's authorities, so the party's nomination was taken by Rodolfo Piza. Piza obtained only 6% of the vote (as slight improvement) and was the fifth candidate in popular vote, but most notable was PUSC's increase in the parliamentary vote becoming the fourth most voted party surpassing Libertarian Movement (till then normally the third-largest party since 2006) and increasing its legislative caucus from six to eight seats.\n\nIn 2015 Calderón and his followers left the party and founded a new one called Social Christian Republican Party (an allusion to Calderón's father historical party). Nevertheless, PUSC saw a victory in the 2016 municipal election gaining second place in municipal votes surpassing ruling PAC and receiving much more votes than Calderón's new party. PUSC obtained 15 mayors (second in number after PLN) and saw an increase in its electoral support, unlike PLN that although the more voted party did saw a decrease in support.\n\nIn 2016, the PUSC declared themselves in favor of equal rights for same-sex couples in terms of marital property, insurance with the Costa Rican Social Security Fund (CCSS) and death inheritance, while still not supporting same-sex marriage.\n\n"}
{"id": "2233996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2233996", "title": "Apocalypse Now Redux", "text": "Apocalypse Now Redux\n\nApocalypse Now Redux is a 2001 extended version of Francis Ford Coppola's epic war film \"Apocalypse Now\", which was originally released in 1979. Coppola, along with editor/longtime collaborator Walter Murch, added 49 minutes of material that had been removed from the original film. It represents a significant re-edit of the original version.\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola began production on the new cut with working-partner Kim Aubry. Coppola then tried to get Murch, who was reluctant at first. He thought it would be extremely difficult recutting a film that had taken two years to edit originally. He later changed his mind (after working on the reconstruction of Orson Welles' \"Touch of Evil\"). Coppola and Murch then examined several of the rough prints and dailies for the film. It was decided early on that the editing of the film would be like editing a new film altogether. One such example was the new French plantation sequence. The scenes were greatly edited to fit into the movie originally, only to be cut out in the end. When working again on the film, instead of using the heavily edited version, Murch decided to work the scene all over again, editing it as if for the first time.\n\nMuch work needed to be done to the new scenes. Due to the off-screen noises during the shoot, most of the dialogue was impossible to hear. During post-production of the film the actors were brought back to re-record their lines (known as A.D.R. or dubbing). This was done for the scenes that made it into the original cut, but not for the deleted scenes. For the \"Redux\" version, Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Sam Bottoms, Albert Hall, Frederic Forrest, and Aurore Clément were brought back to record ADR for the new scenes.\n\nNew music was composed and recorded for the remade film by San Francisco Bay Area-based composer Ed Goldfarb. For example, it was thought no music had been composed for Willard and Roxanne's romantic interlude in the French Plantation scene. To make matters worse, composer Carmine Coppola had died in 1991. However, the old recording and musical scores were checked and a track titled \"Love Theme\" was found. During scoring, Francis Coppola had told Carmine, his father, to write a theme for the scene before it was ultimately deleted. For the remake, the track was recorded by a group of synthesists.\n\nVittorio Storaro also returned from Italy to head the development of a new color balance of the film and new scenes. When \"Redux\" was being released, Storaro learned that a Technicolor dye-transfer process was being brought back. The dye-transfer is a three-strip process that makes the color highly saturated and has consistent black tone. Storaro wished to use this on \"Redux\", but in order to do it, he needed to cut the original negative of \"Apocalypse Now\", leaving \"Apocalypse Now Redux\" the only version available. Storaro decided to do it, when convinced by Coppola that this version would be the one that would be remembered.\n\nThe film contains several alterations, and two entirely new scenes. One of the new scenes has the boat meeting the Playmates once again, further up the river; the other has them meet a family of holdout French colonists on their remote rubber plantation. There are also a few additional scenes with Colonel Kurtz.\n\n\n\"Apocalypse Now Redux\" originally premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. The screening marked the anniversary of the original \"Apocalypse Now\" screening as a work in progress, where it won the Palme d'Or. Coppola went to the festival, accompanied by Murch, Storaro, production designer Dean Tavoularis, producer Kim Aubry and actors Bottoms and Clément.\n\nThe film was given a limited release in the U.S. on August 3, 2001, and was also released theatrically around the world in some countries, grossing in the United States and Canada, and in other territories, for a worldwide total of .\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 93% approval rating based on 82 reviews, with an average rating of 7.78/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"The additional footage slows down the movie somewhat (some say the new cut is inferior to the original), but \"Apocalypse Now Redux\" is still a great piece of cinema.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 92 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Some critics thought highly of the additions, such as A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\", who wrote that it \"grows richer and stranger with each viewing, and the restoration of scenes left in the cutting room two decades ago has only added to its sublimity.\"\n\nSome critics, however, thought the new scenes slowed the pacing, were too lengthy (notably the French plantation sequence), and added nothing overall to the film's impact. Owen Gleiberman wrote \"\"Apocalypse Now Redux\" is the meandering, indulgent art project that [Francis Ford Coppola] was still enough of a craftsman, in 1979, to avoid.\" Despite this, other critics still gave it high ratings. Roger Ebert wrote: \"Longer or shorter, redux or not, \"Apocalypse Now\" is one of the central events of my life as a filmgoer.\"\n\nA soundtrack was released on July 31, 2001 by Nonesuch. The soundtrack contains most of the original tracks (remastered), as well as some for the new scenes (\"Clean's Funeral\", \"Love Theme\").

He spent some years as a coach in the United States and England, before he was appointed as manager of Sligo Rovers in September 2004. He led the club to the League of Ireland First Division title in 2005. He took charge at Bohemians in November 2006, before losing his job in December 2007. He was appointed Dundalk manager in December 2008, and then joined Galway United as manager in December 2010. He then had brief and highly unsuccessful spells coaching in Africa with Zimbabwean side CAPS United in 2012 and South African club Black Leopards in 2014. He returned to management in Northern Ireland with Institute in September 2019.\n\nConnor began his career at Distillery in the Irish League, playing for the club in the 1987–88 season before he joined English Third Division club Port Vale. He never made an appearance for the \"Valiants\" in the English Football League and went out on loan to Macclesfield Town of the Conference before he returned to Northern Ireland to play for Ards. He was involved in a car accident soon after signing for Ards, breaking his chest bone, some ribs, puncturing his lung and damaging his left leg. He made a return to football with Cliftonville but retired shortly afterwards.\n\nAfter spending some time as press officer for Birmingham City, Connor moved to America where he coached in the USL First Division under John McGinlay for Cincinnati Riverhawks, Boston Bulldogs and in the Eastern Indoor Soccer League with the Lafayette SwampCats. He also spent time coaching non-league clubs in England and scouting for Stoke City and Lincoln City.\n\nConnor was appointed Sligo Rovers manager in September 2004 upon the recommendation of Steve Bruce. He led the club to the League of Ireland First Division title in 2005 as Rovers finished two points clear of second-place Dublin City. He then took the club to a fifth place in the League of Ireland Premier Division in 2006 and the semi-finals of the FAI Cup, where they lost to Derry City after a replay. During his time at The Showgrounds he signed Séamus Coleman. Connor tendered his resignation in November 2006 after stating that he felt he was \"never fully accepted\" at the club and life there was like \"living in a goldfish bowl\".\n\nHe was appointed as manager of Bohemians in November 2006. He led the \"Bohs\" to third-place in 2007, earning them a place in the UEFA Intertoto Cup. He also took the club to the semi-finals of the FAI Cup, where they were beaten by Cork City at Dalymount Park. However he was sacked by the club after he allegedly made \"advances of a sexual nature\" to a female volunteer; Connor denied the claim.\n\nIn December 2008, he was appointed as the manager of newly promoted Premier Division side Dundalk, who were transitioning from amateur status to become professional. He was voted Premier Division Manager of the Month for July 2009, and led the club to a fifth-place finish in the 2009 season, earning them a place in the following season's UEFA Europa League qualification rounds. He resigned in November 2009.\n\nIn January 2010, he signed a three-year contract to manage Galway United. He led the \"Tribesmen\" to an eighth-place finish in the 2010 season, and a relegation play-off win over Bray Wanderers at Terryland Park secured the club a place in the top-flight for the following year. His contract was \"terminated by mutual agreement\" in September 2011 after the club suffered their 23rd consecutive league defeat.\n\nIn January 2012, Connor was appointed as manager of Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League side CAPS United. His contract was terminated in August 2012 following a poor run of results. He fled Zimbabwe after claiming that he had received death threats from the club's staff and fans, that the club still owed him $90,000, and that the players deliberately underperformed to get him the sack. He spent some time in exile in South Africa without any finances as the legal battle with CAPS United continued.\n\nHe signed a three-year contract to manage South African National First Division side Black Leopards in July 2014, and was instructed to guide the club into the Premier Soccer League. He was fired after just six weeks having picked up just two points from his first three games. He joined the coaching staff at the Maiden City Soccer Academy in County Londonderry in March 2015.\n\nOn 14 September 2019, he returned to senior management when he was appointed as first-team manager at NIFL Premiership club Institute.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2234001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2234001", "title": "High Stile", "text": "High Stile\n\nHigh Stile is a mountain in the western part of the Lake District in North West England. It is the eleventh-highest English Marilyn, standing 807 metres (2,648 ft) high, and has a relative height of 362 metres (1,187 ft).\n\nIt is the highest in the range of fells extending north-west from Great Gable towards Loweswater, and together with its satellites, Red Pike and High Crag, forms a trio of fells overlooking the lake and village of Buttermere. On this side are high crags, wild combes and a small tarn, Bleaberry Tarn. High Stile is most easily ascended as part of a traverse of the three fells.\n\nThe Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley. The highest section of the northern branch is formed by the trio of Buttermere fells, High Crag, High Stile and Red Pike.\n\nThe Buttermere Fells, also known as Buttermere Edge, form the watershed between Buttermere and Upper Ennerdale. The Ennerdale flanks are steep and rough with areas of crag, the lower slopes being planted with a ribbon of conifers. Across the narrow ridge-top to the north are deep corries and dark walls of crag, glowering down over the lake. The ridge continues south east to Haystacks and the Great Gable group. Beyond Red Pike to the west are Starling Dodd, Great Borne and the Loweswater Fells.\nAll three Buttermere Fells throw out a short spur towards the lake with deep combs hollowed out between them. North west of High Stile is Bleaberry Comb, backed by the wall of Chapel Crags. Nestled deep within is Bleaberry Tarn, a pool which is on continual shadow from November to March. Despite the steep contours of the rock walls above, the tarn is only about deep, and is well stocked with trout. Bleaberry Tarn is drained into Buttermere by Sourmilk Gill, reaching the lake mere yards from its outlet. A belt of trees has been planted along the shoreline. Birkness Comb, also called Burtness Comb on Ordnance Survey maps, lies between the truncated and unnamed northern ridges of High Crag and High Stile. The lack of a retaining moraine means that this hollow has no tarn, Comb Beck running uninterrupted to the Lake. Grey Crag and Eagle Crag are the main faces on High Stile. These corries being scooped out of the northern face result in the connecting ridges between the three Buttermere Fells being fine and narrow.\n\nThe Ennerdale flanks have a tier of crag at around , The Knors and Raven Crag being the principal features. At the foot of the slopes are the massed conifers of the Ennerdale Forest, all contributing to the difficulty of access. There are no paths on the southern flank of High Stile.\n\nThe summit area is formed of the siltstone, sandstone, conglomerate, tuff, lapilli-tuff and andesite sills of the Eagle Crag Member. The northern slopes display the underlying olistostrome of disrupted, sheared and folded mudstone, siltstone and sandstone of the Buttermere Formation. In the direction of Red Pike are intrusions of the granophyric granite.\n\nIn Burtness Comb, a prominent bank of debris runs along the outer flank of the upper cirque, then turns down into the lower cirque, ending in a block strew at the intake wall. It marks the course of a rock avalanche which fell from Grey Crag on the summit rim of High Stile, and was channeled along the foot of the glacier some 11,000 years ago. It is unique in the Lake District.\n\nThere are the remains of a small copper-mine near the shore of Buttermere. This was worked from 1569 to 1570 and again in the 1820s.\n\nThe highest point lies a little way out onto the northern spur at the top of Grey Crag, marked by a cairn. The highest point on the main ridge is only lower and was regarded as the summit by Alfred Wainwright, the maps available at the time not deciding the issue. This top has two main cairns side by side. In an attempt to avoid confusion some guidebooks refer to the summit as Grey Crag and the top on the ridge as High Stile.\n\nThe view is extensive, the highlight perhaps being the North Western Fells across the Buttermere valley. Ennerdale Water and Crummock Water are in view and careful steps toward the brink can also add Bleaberry Tarn to the picture. Fine views of the crags of the surrounding combs complete the foreground.\n\nThe fell is usually ascended as a traverse of the ‘Buttermere Three’, as the north eastern flank is very steep and rough. Strong walkers may continue the walk towards Haystacks, four miles (6 km) to the south east. The direct ascent from Ennerdale (through forest and steep bracken) is not found in guidebooks. The fell is climbed as part of \"Variation 1\" on the Coast to Coast Walk.\n\nDirect ascents can be made if desired via either of the northern combs. From the shore of Buttermere a path runs up into Birkness Comb from where the northern spur can be gained. From Buttermere village the path to Bleaberry Tarn can be used, branching off to find a line around the eastern end of Chapel Crags. If climbing from Ennerdale the route up Red Pike may be used.\n"}

Their original purpose was to provide insight into the logical requirements for machine self-replication, and they were used in von Neumann's universal constructor.\n\nNobili's cellular automaton is a variation of von Neumann's cellular automaton, augmented with the ability for confluent cells to cross signals and store information. The former requires an extra three states, hence Nobili's cellular automaton has 32 states, rather than 29. Hutton's cellular automaton is yet another variation, which allows a loop of data, analogous to Langton's loops, to replicate.\n\nIn general, cellular automata (CA) constitute an arrangement of finite state automata (FSA) that sit in positional relationships between one another, each FSA exchanging information with those other FSAs to which it is positionally adjacent. In von Neumann's cellular automaton, the finite state machines (or cells) are arranged in a two-dimensional Cartesian grid, and interface with the surrounding four cells. As von Neumann's cellular automaton was the first example to use this arrangement, it is known as the von Neumann neighbourhood.\n\nThe set of FSAs define a cell space of infinite size. All FSAs are identical in terms of state-transition function, or rule-set. \n\nThe neighborhood (a grouping function) is part of the state-transition function, and defines for any cell the set of other cells upon which the state of that cell depends.\n\nAll cells make their transitions synchronously, in step with a universal \"clock\" as in a synchronous digital circuit.\n\nEach FSA of the von Neumann cell space can accept any of the 29 states of the rule-set. The rule-set is grouped into five orthogonal subsets. Each state includes the colour of the cell in the cellular automata program Golly in (red, green, blue). They are\n\n\n\"Excited\" states carry data, at the rate of one bit per state transition step.\n\nNote that confluent states have the property of a one-cycle delay, thus effectively holding two bits of data at any given time.\n\nThe flow of bits between cells is indicated by the direction property. The following rules apply:\n\nThe following specific rules apply to confluent states:\n\nInitially, much of the cell-space, the universe of the cellular automaton, is \"blank,\" consisting of cells in the ground state U. When given an input excitation from a neighboring ordinary- or special transmission state, the cell in the ground state becomes \"sensitised,\" transitioning through a series of states before finally \"resting\" at a quiescent transmission or confluent state.\n\nThe choice of which destination state the cell will reach is determined by the sequence of input signals. Therefore, the transition/sensitised states can be thought of as the nodes of a bifurcation tree leading from the ground-state to each of the quiescent transmission and confluent states.\n\nIn the following tree, the sequence of inputs is shown as a binary string after each step:\n\n\nNote that:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Already some women had successfully petitioned to join regular military units, now a number began pressing the new Provisional Government to create special women's battalions. These women, along with a number of high-ranking members of the Russian government and military administration, believed that female soldiers would have significant propaganda value and that their example would revitalize the weary, demoralized men of the Russian army. Simultaneously, they hoped the presence of women would shame hesitant male soldiers into resuming their combat duties.\n\nFifteen formations were created in 1917, including the 1st Russian Women's Battalion of Death, a separate unit called the 1st Petrograd Women's Battalion formed a few weeks later in Petrograd, the 2nd Moscow Women's Battalion of Death created in Moscow, and the 3rd Kuban Women's Shock Battalion organized in Ekaterinodar. Four communications detachments were created in Moscow and Petrograd. Seven additional communications units were created in Kiev and Saratov employing privately organized women's units already in those cities. Additional unsanctioned battalions sprang up in cities across Russia. An all-female naval unit was created in Oranienbaum, the 1st Women's Naval Detachment, as part of the Naval Infantry Training Detachment.\n\nAmerican reporter Bessie Beatty estimated the total number of women serving in these gender-segregated units at 5,000 in the fall of 1917, but only the 1st Russian Women's Battalion of Death and the Perm Battalion were deployed to the front.\n\nIn May 1917, Maria Bochkareva, a peasant woman who had served in the Russian army since November 1914 and had risen to the rank of non-commissioned officer, petitioned the government to establish a battalion of female soldiers under her command. At the end of May, the Minister of War of the Russian Provisional Government, Alexander Kerensky, authorized the formation of the 1st Russian Women's Battalion of Death in Petrograd. This first all-female combat unit initially attracted over 2,000 enlistees between the ages of eighteen and forty, but Bochkareva's strict discipline and refusal to allow the formation of soldiers' committees soon drove out all but about 300 volunteers.\n\nCalled into action against the Germans during the Kerensky Offensive, they were assigned to the 525th Kiuruk-Darinski Regiment and occupied a trench near Smorgon. Ordered to go over the top, the soldiers of the war weary men's battalions hesitated. The women, however, decided to go with or without them. Eventually they pushed past three trenches into German territory, where soldiers discovered a stash of vodka, which the women tried to break before they could be drunk. In his report, the commander of the regiment praised the women's battalion's initiative and courage. However, relief units never arrived and they were eventually forced to retreat, losing all the ground gained in the offensive.\n\nThe 1st Russian Women's Battalion of Death, commanded by Bochkareva, was still at the front after the revolution, but disbanded shortly after as a result of increasing hostility from male troops who wanted an end to the war and resented female volunteers for prolonging it.\n\nThe creation of the first all-female combat unit under Bochkareva inspired a number of other women in Russia to appeal to the government for inclusion in the armed forces. The Ministry of War was flooded with letters and petitions from individuals and groups of women seeking to serve their nation at the front. In June, Kerensky approved the organization of an additional women's combat unit in Petrograd, the 1st Petrograd Women's Battalion, with a complement of between 1,100 and 1,400 women and two communications detachments of 100 women volunteers each. Their training regimen included not only parade drill, riflery, and night maneuvers, but also reading classes for the illiterate.\n\nOn 25 October 1917, the battalion was called to the Palace Square for a review before being sent to the front. After the parade, the battalion was instead ordered to defend the Provisional Government at the Winter Palace. The commander refused. Instead a subdivision of 2nd company, 137 soldiers, were dispatched to guard some nearby fuel trucks, but soon found themselves defending the palace alongside units of Cossacks and cadets. These were overwhelmed by the numerically superior pro-Bolshevik forces and ultimately surrendered. Rumors of mass rape circulated in the city after their capture; interviews of the women found three cases of rape but many instances of verbal abuse, physical violence, and threats of sexual violence. The wife of the British ambassador to Russia requested that the British military attaché in Petrograd, General Alfred Knox, intervene to secure their release, which was accomplished on 26 October. Those who did not disband returned to the battalion's encampment outside of the city and were rearmed.\n\nThe 2nd Moscow Women's Battalion of Death, as well as two separate communications detachments, were created in Moscow in June, 1917.\nThe battalion numbered at least 1,000 women by the end of the summer. By the end of the fall, facing a lack of support from the government, the leadership of the battalion decided to disband. Five hundred women requested assignment to the front instead, and were issued transfers without the knowledge of the General Staff.\n\nAuthorization from the government for the formation of women's military units provided impetus for private women's organizations to form their own quasi-military units, which appeared in numerous cities around Russia. In an attempt to satisfy popular demand and to bring these units under its control the Ministry of War expanded the number of women's military formations. A fourth combat battalion was formed in Ekaterinodar, the 3rd Kuban Women's Shock Battalion, created from a pre-existing grass-roots unit. This battalion suffered from organizational and supply issues and never saw combat.\n\nThese extensions failed to end the impromptu organization of quasi-military units of women volunteers, and the government found it impossible to control such formations due to their unofficial status. For the official formations, there was no consensus among the military administration as to the potential value of female soldiers, and this, coupled with the severe shortages from which the nation was then suffering, meant that the army made only a half-hearted commitment to the project. Thus, the women's units received inadequate attention and assistance from the military administration. Many among the Russian military authorities were waiting to see how the women fared in battle and whether they would have a positive effect on male soldiers.\n\nAfter the 1st Russian Women's Battalion of Death failed to have the intended effect of revitalizing the war-weary elements of the Russian army the military authorities began to question the value of the women's units. In particular, the government found it difficult to justify the allocation of badly needed resources to such an unreliable project. By August 1917, there was a growing inclination in the military establishment to discontinue the organization of women for combat purposes. Facing withdrawal of official support the 2nd Moscow Women's Battalion of Death began to disintegrate in September. Just prior to disbanding, however, about 500 volunteers were sent to the front at their own request but without the knowledge or permission of the military authorities.\n\nFaced with the decision of what to do with their women's units, the military at first decided to shift them into auxiliary roles away from the front, such as guarding railroads, but this faced opposition from men in those positions who would in turn be sent to the front. Instead, on 30 November 1917, the new Bolshevik government ordered the official dissolution of any remaining women's military formations. However, members of the 1st Petrograd and 3rd Kuban women's battalions lingered in their camps until early 1918. Some women who had served in these units went on to fight on both sides of the Russian Civil War.\n\n\n\n"}

The PlayStation 2 version was re-released in the three-disc \"Crash Bandicoot Action Pack\" compilation (alongside \"Crash Nitro Kart\" and \"Crash Tag Team Racing\") in the United States on June 12, 2007, and in Europe on July 20, 2007. A GameCube version was planned before being cancelled for undisclosed reasons.\n\n\"Twinsanity\" is the eleventh installment in the \"Crash Bandicoot\" series and the fifth game in the main franchise. The game's story takes place three years after the events of \"\" and follows the main protagonist and main antagonist of the series, Crash Bandicoot and Doctor Neo Cortex, working together to stop \"the Evil Twins\", a duo of mutant parrots that Cortex owned as a child, from destroying the Wumpa Islands. \n\n\"Twinsanity\" was released to mixed reviews, with praise being directed towards its visuals, humor, soundtrack by the a capella group Spiralmouth and Lex Lang's portrayal of Cortex, while criticism focused on its short length, uninspired level design and glitches. The game is often viewed among the series' fans as one of the best post-Naughty Dog \"Crash\" games, with interest among fans particularly centered on content that was cut from the game. As such, the game has garnered a dedicated cult following.\n\nThe gameplay of \"Crash Twinsanity\" is in a free-roaming style, although the linear path based gameplay of the previous installments occasionally reappears. The game's plot is pushed forward by going through levels. Gems littered throughout the levels can be collected to unlock extras such as concept art. Crash is occasionally accompanied by a second character, in this case his nemesis Doctor Neo Cortex.\n\nCrash can use Cortex as a hammer, perform a spin attack while holding on to him, throw him across gaps to activate switches, and can even use him as a snowboard dubbed the 'HumiliSkate.' While most of the time Crash could happily swing Cortex to his doom and have him return safely, in other sections of the game, Crash must clear a path for a disoriented Cortex to prevent him from blundering into deadly obstacles. In the earlier levels, Crash and Cortex will get drawn into a RollerBrawl. The player must steer the scrapping pair around obstacles to reach their goal.\n\nIn some areas of the game, such as the Academy of Evil, Cortex will go solo, armed with a raygun and a limited amount of ammo. Another controllable character is Cortex's niece, Nina Cortex. She fights through the levels using her mechanical arms and wall-climbing abilities. At the very last part of the game, Crash goes into the robot Mecha-Bandicoot. He is the final playable character and can fire rockets.\n\nThree years after by Crash, Doctor Neo Cortex returns to the Wumpa Islands to exact revenge on Crash. Cortex incapacitates Crash's sister Coco and impersonates her to lure Crash into a trap. After Crash's victory against Cortex and his Mecha-Bandicoot, Cortex and Crash are both sent plummeting down a hole and land in a cave. Enraged by his defeat, Cortex attacks Crash, and the pair engage in a prolonged fight across the cave. Upon returning to the surface, Crash and Cortex encounter a pair of trans-dimensional beings named the Evil Twins, who plan to destroy the Wumpa Islands and steal Cortex's brain. After Cortex pleads for Crash's help, he is spontaneously attacked by bees and finds himself captured by Papu Papu and his subordinate tribesmen after stumbling into their territory. Crash rescues Cortex from captivity and escapes a pursuing mob of tribesmen. Crash and Cortex have another encounter with the Evil Twins, who bring a deity statue to life to attack the pair. Cortex, having learned that the Evil Twins come from the Tenth Dimension, concocts a plan and beckons Crash to his lair near the Antarctic Circle.\n\nCrash and Cortex attempt to enter the Iceberg Lair through the front entrance, but the door is frozen shut, forcing the pair to take an alternate path inside. They inadvertently free Uka Uka in the process, who attacks them with a giant body formed from ice. Uka Uka is convinced by his twin brother Aku Aku to join forces and attack the Evil Twins themselves, but both are easily defeated. Cortex introduces the Psychetron, a device that will allow travel to the Tenth Dimension, but requires Power Crystals to function. In an attempt to reach Doctor N. Gin's battleship and gather the Power Crystals, Crash uses Cortex as an impromptu snowboard and destroys Dingodile's shack in the process. Crash's venture through the battleship eventually results in an explosion of a cache of TNT crates, which sinks the ship and propels Crash into a confrontation with Doctors Nefarious Tropy and Nitrus Brio on a distant ice floe. Crash returns to the Iceberg Lair with Cortex, where the latter is attacked by a recovered Coco, who believes that Cortex kidnapped Crash. Coco's assault sends two of the Power Crystals flying into the Psychetron, which damages the machine and paralyzes Coco in a chain reaction. Crash and Cortex set a course for Madame Amberly's Academy of Evil in the hopes of recruiting Cortex's niece Nina to assist in repairing the Psychetron.\n\nCrash and Cortex sneak into the Academy through the sewer system, where they fend off an attack from Dingodile. After Cortex finds Nina and has an encounter with Madame Amberly, he recalls the origin of the Evil Twins: when Cortex was an 8-year-old student in the Academy, he used his two pet parrots Victor and Moritz as test subjects for a prototype of his Evolvo-Ray, but the experiment resulted in the parrots being transported to the Tenth Dimension, where they would be mutated by the environment's severe \"reverso-radiation\". The trio return to the Iceberg Lair, repair the Psychetron and travel to the Tenth Dimension to face the Evil Twins. Upon their arrival, Nina is kidnapped by an evil doppelganger of Crash and taken to his desolate home on Twinsanity Island. Crash is forced once again to use Cortex as a snowboard and they corner Evil Crash. Cortex valiantly offers himself in Nina's stead, which leads to a chase scene. After escaping Evil Crash, Crash, Cortex and Nina make their way to the Evil Twins' compound, where Cortex confronts the Evil Twins and commands them back into their cage. The Evil Twins transform their cage into a giant robot and engage in a final battle with the trio. The Evil Twins are defeated and flee the compound, only to be devoured by Evil Crash when they take refuge in his home. After the trio return to their own dimension, Cortex attempts to eliminate Crash, but the malfunctioning Psychetron teleports Cortex into Crash's brain, where he is trapped with a crowd of dancing Crash duplicates.\n\n\"Crash Twinsanity\" was developed by Traveller's Tales Oxford and published by Vivendi Games in North America and by Sierra Entertainment in Europe and Australia. The game was originally titled \"Crash Bandicoot Evolution\" and featured a premise involving the Evil Twins stealing Crash's island from Earth and grafting it onto a giant planet made from pieces of others. The tone of the game was intended to be more serious than preceding entries in the series, with the term \"edgy\" being widely used among the development team. Richard M. Albon, the lead conceptual artist for \"Crash Bandicoot Evolution\", based the Evil Twins on his girlfriend's two hateful cockatiels. In response to the release of Insomniac Games' \"Ratchet & Clank\", which featured an identical premise, Traveller's Tales abandoned \"Crash Bandicoot Evolution\" and restarted production with a focus on making the next \"Crash\" title as comedic as possible. The new game went through several working subtitles, including \"Unlimited\", \"Fully Fluxed\" and \"Twinsane\"; the \"Unlimited\" subtitle appears in a PAL-region demo released with the September 2004 issue of \"Official UK PlayStation 2 Magazine\". Eventually, Vivendi Games gave Traveller's Tales one hour to choose the final title before the default selection of \"Unlimited\". Lead artist Keith Webb came up with the title \"Crash Twinsanity\" with only five minutes to spare.\n\nThe character Nina Cortex was created and designed by Duke Mighten for an early version of \"Crash Nitro Kart\", and was reappropriated for \"Crash Twinsanity\" due to her popularity among the development team. Lead designer Paul Gardner created a rough model of Nina modified from that of Neo Cortex, and her final model was created by Chris Abedelmassieh. Nina's model was created over the course of a single weekend. Although \"Crash Twinsanity\" was intended to be Nina's debut appearance, Gardner was alerted to her early appearance in \"\" by Webb, who came across Nina's image in newly-released screenshots of the game. Crunch Bandicoot was included in a cameo appearance due to his fan-favourite status. A stage taking place in Coco's mind, \"Gone a Bit Coco\", was removed because production was too far along to guarantee that the stage could be finished and played without crashing. Other content, such as a cameo by Fake Crash and the appearance of a good version of Doctor Cortex, was also removed, but appears in unlockable concept images in the final game. A punching maneuver by Crash that appeared in the \"Crash Bandicoot Unlimited\" demo was removed due to its inadvertent capability of destroying scenery.\n\nWhen Lang was called in for an audition to replace previous voice actor Clancy Brown, the voice director described Doctor Cortex to him and had him listen to signature samples of Brown's performance. When Lang was given the freedom to develop the character with the director, they eventually created a depiction of Cortex that was \"master evil with a bit of a childish feminine side that leaks out in his tirades\" that had everyone laughing at the lines and the character. As a result, that of Cortex stuck. Almost fifteen years later since the game's release in 2019 revealed that Lang's voice for Doctor Cortex was inspired after numerous viewings of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" growing up. Other voice roles include Mel Winkler as Aku Aku and a tribesman, Michael Ensign as Doctor Nefarious Tropy and a tribesman, Susan Silo as Madame Amberley and Nina Cortex, Debi Derryberry as Coco Bandicoot and Neo Cortex as an eight-year-old, Alex Fernandez as Uka Uka and Farmer Ernest, Dwight Schultz as Dingodile, Rusty Walrus, a tribesman and Papu Papu, and Quinton Flynn as Doctor N. Gin, Victor, Moritz and a penguin.\n\nThe full-motion videos of \"Crash Twinsanity\" were created by Red Eye Studios, who previously created the full-motion videos for \"Crash Nitro Kart\". The soundtrack of \"Crash Twinsanity\" was composed, performed, arranged and produced by an a cappella band Spiralmouth, while Gabriel Mann recorded and mixed the soundtrack at Asylum Recording Studios in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Crash Twinsanity\" received mixed or average reviews from critics upon release. \"Play Magazine\" declared that \"Traveller's Tales has delivered a 60 frame/s cartoon epic without sacrificing expanse, dwarfing boss encounters or vivid effects by skillfully balancing model and environment integrity with performance.\" James B. Pringle of IGN said that \"Publisher Vivendi Universal and developer Traveller's Tales have infused so much humor and likeability into the game that you will literally laugh out loud. You'll look forward to defeating each boss not just because you're that much closer to beating the game, but to witness some of the best in-game dialogue and funniest voice acting around.\"\n\nAndrew Wooldridge of 1UP.com said the game \"is funny, fun to play, and is a definite improvement on the claustrophobic linear levels of games past\". Chris Stead of \"GamePro\" described the game as \"great fun for our gaming youth and a humorous piece of nostalgia for veterans keen to spank their bandicoots, one last time\". Brent Soboleski of TeamXbox crowned the game as \"one of the best \"Crash\" titles to have been released since its earliest inception on home consoles, and its creative use of combining past enemies as partners is what gives \"Twinsanity\" a new lease on life\". Nick Valentino of GameZone said that the game \"rises above the game's original roots to bring a game that's both refreshingly humorous as well as downright enjoyable\".\n\nHowever, Louis Bedigian of the same site described the game as \"double the insanity for all you psychopath-loving gamers out there, but it's half the fun for gamers\". Ryan Davis of GameSpot concluded that \"it's a little rough around the edges, and it doesn't break new ground for 3D platformers, but it gives the series the shot in the arm that \"\" failed to, and what it does, it does pretty well\". \"Official Xbox Magazine\" declared that \"even if you're frustrated by dying on a jump for the 50th time, you'll still think it's funny as hell.\" Kristan Reed of Eurogamer said that \"the gameplay variation is there for all to see, and when it hits the mark it — believe it or not — is every bit as enjoyable as the very best the genre has to offer, with some true high points to look back on.\"\n\n\"\" praised the graphics and controls but criticized the level design, saying that it was \"designed to kill the player in as many cheap ways as possible\". A reviewer for \"Game Informer\" finished with \"While it pains me to say this, maybe \"Crash\" should make like the entire cast of \"Blossom\" and disappear.\" \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\" described the game as \"a bummer\" and \"a tragic tale of missed opportunities, as a funny, engaging platformer shines through the me-too muck\". \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" decided that \"the funny writing (courtesy of an ex-\"Ren & Stimpy\" scribe) can't save this uninspired rehash of antiquated \"Crash\" antics with lackluster visuals.\"\n\nLex Lang's portrayal of Doctor Cortex in \"Crash Twinsanity\" was singled out for praise among reviewers. James B. Pringle of IGN noted that the game \"shows a side of the evil doctor that we haven't seen before\" and, while describing the game's dialogue as \"solid,\" said that \"Cortex is the one you want to keep listening to.\" Ryan Davis of GameSpot analyzed \"Cortex's constant creeping and sniveling\" as \"a great showcase of the kinds of neuroses that might cause one to gain an interest in evil science,\" and added that \"the strained grandeur of Cortex's speech\" was the most \"accomplished\" voice work in the game. Gordy Wheeler of Worth Playing considered Cortex \"having abuse heaped on him like a classic Warner Brothers character\" to be \"the most fun part of this game,\" and went on to heavily praise Lang's vocal performance, writing that \"just about all of the game's best lines come from Cortex, and his voice actor brings it home solidly. He may be on the way to being my favorite mad scientist ever and that's a heck of a feat. Someone get his voice actor into another role RIGHT NOW. I want more of him.\" Brent Soboleski of TeamXbox believed that Cortex was \"probably the best and most entertaining character of the game since players get a completely different look at his personality this time through,\" and felt that he was \"very funny and his sarcasm and evil attitude are a perfect match for his personality.\" Nick Valentino of GameZone felt that \"the biggest laughs, believe it or not, come from Doctor Neo Cortex who comes off as nutty in the best possible way. He's filled with witty observations and often pokes fun of his past encounters with Crash.\" He later remarked that \"the twisted Doctor is one hilarious bloke and his dialogue just makes him all the more likeable.\"\n\nAccording to Keith Webb, one of the main artists for \"Crash Twinsanity\", after the development of the game, Traveller's Tales Oxford studio had plans for a sequel, which was ultimately not accepted by Vivendi Universal. The plot would have centered around Crash getting sucked into various TV shows (such as a wild west show, or an old black-and-white cartoon) by an invention created by Dr. Cortex, similar to the \"Gex\" series. The game was going to have over 25 levels, one of them being a hospital drama level that would have had enemies holding needles and Crash would ride through the hospital halls on a stretcher. Webb also mentioned a level with Rusty Walrus hosting a cooking show, ending up with a chase sequence, similar to Crash's last encounter with him. This idea for a sequel was cancelled alongside the studio's closure, and development of further \"Crash Bandicoot\" games was transferred to Radical Entertainment, leading to \"Crash of the Titans\". Webb would later state in an interview in 2012<ref>\n"}

Collins was involved in local politics for many years, serving as a councillor and chairman of the Limerick County Council. He was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1997 general election as a Fianna Fáil TD and held his seat until retiring at the 2007 general election citing health reasons.

{"id": "2234044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2234044", "title": "Agostino Bassi", "text": "Agostino Bassi\n\nAgostino Bassi, sometimes called de Lodi (25 September 1773 – 8 February 1856), was an Italian entomologist. He preceded Louis Pasteur in the discovery that microorganisms can be the cause of disease (the germ theory of disease). He discovered that the muscardine disease of silkworms was caused by a living, very small, parasitic organism, a fungus that would be named eventually \"Beauveria bassiana\" in his honor. In 1844, he stated the idea that not only animal (insect), but also human diseases are caused by other living microorganisms; for example, measles, syphilis, and the plague.\n\nHe was the son of a wealthy farmer and a lawyer who also had a passion for biology. However, his father did not want him to take up biology, but wanted him instead to look after the family's property, to become a civil servant and to join the Imperial administration.\n\nBassi did so, but also followed the lessons of Lazzaro Spallanzani, a relative, until he died.\n\nHis studies of 1807 concerned \"mal de segno\" (also known as muscardine, after a French candy), a lethal disease of domestic silkworms (\"Bombyx mori\"). Infected caterpillars are covered with a fine white powder and die. This disease initially appeared in Italy around 1805; then in France, by 1841. After 1849, the silk farms were almost all abandoned because of this devastating disease. The research to find the cause of this disease took him 25 years. Bassi published the results of his investigations in a paper entitled \"Del mal del segno, calcinaccio o moscardino\" (1835), stating that a living entity was the culprit, and that it was contagious; we now know that the powdery appearance on the killed silkworms is caused by the production of millions of infectious white fungal spores on the dead insect (see \"Beauveria bassiana\"). He is credited with rescuing the economically important silk industry, by recommendations like the use of disinfectants; separating the rows of feeding caterpillars; isolating and destroying infected caterpillars; and keeping the farms clean. This brought Bassi immediate fame. \"\"Del Mal del Segno, Calcinaccio o Moscardino\"\" was translated into French and distributed throughout Europe.\n\nFrom this work he expanded on a theory explaining that many diseases of plants, animals and human beings were caused by pathogenic organisms. He thus preceded the work of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch. He was also the author of work on the culture of potatoes, on cheese, wine making, leprosy and cholera.\nLouis Pasteur (1822–1895) was greatly influenced by his work. Pasteur had the portraits of both Spallanzani and Bassi in his office.\n\nAgostino Bassi was buried in the Romanesque church of Saint Francis (13th century). His tomb can be seen in the right transept, laid to a wall, at the ground level.\n\nIn 1953 the Italian post office issued a stamp on the 180th anniversary of Bassi's birth in 1773. The stamp features a portrait of Bassi bordered by silkmoth adults and pupae .\n\n\n"}

With only al-Amir's infant son al-Tayyib as a possible successor, al-Hafiz became regent as the oldest surviving member of the dynasty. Al-Tayyib was sidelined, which in turn was overthrown within a few days by the army under Kutayfat. The latter imprisoned al-Hafiz, and moved to depose the Fatimids and replace Isma'ilism with a personal regime, possibly based on Twelver Shi'ism, with himself as the absent imam's all-powerful vicegerent. Kutayfat's regime was toppled when he was murdered by Fatimid loyalists in December 1131, and al-Hafiz was freed and restored as regent.\n\nOn 23 January 1132, he proclaimed himself as the legitimate imam and caliph. While necessary in view of the lack of another heir, the succession was highly irregular, as the imamate had previously only passed from father to son by explicit designation (). Al-Hafiz was largely accepted in the Fatimid-ruled territories, but many Isma'ili followers abroad refused to recognize him and regarded the vanished al-Tayyib as their imam, causing the Hafizi–Tayyibi schism in Musta'li Isma'ilism. Even in Egypt, his legitimacy was repeatedly challenged for the duration of his reign, which was troubled by constant uprisings and power struggles. Al-Hafiz's reign was mostly quiet on the external front. Despite continuing hostilities with the Kingdom of Jerusalem around Ascalon, both powers were preoccupied elsewhere for the most part. The Fatimid court also maintained contact with the Burids in Syria and King Roger II of Sicily, who at this time began his expansion into the former Fatimid domains of Ifriqiya, and adopted many of the practices of the Fatimid court for his own administration.\n\nAs ruler, al-Hafiz tried to rein in his over-mighty viziers with mixed success, as he was repeatedly forced to give way to the demands of various military factions, and ultimately unable to halt the evolution of the vizierate into a \"de facto\" sultanate independent of the caliph. Thus al-Hafiz's own son Hasan forced him to name him vizier in 1134, overthrowing another of the Caliph's sons; Hasan's reign proved tyrannical and he was overthrown by the army in March 1135. The appointment of the Christian Bahram al-Armani to the vizierate after that caused a severe reaction by the Muslim public opinion due to Bahram's pro-Christian policies, leading to another uprising and the appointment of the Sunni Ridwan ibn Walakhshi to the vizierate in 1137. Ridwan not only instituted anti-Christian and anti-Jewish measures, but even aimed to overthrow al-Hafiz and replace the Fatimid dynasty with a Sunni regime headed by himself. With the support of the Cairo populace, al-Hafiz managed to thwart his ambitions and oust Ridwan in 1139. For the next ten years, the Caliph ruled without a vizier, instead entrusting the administration to a succession of secretaries, with Ibn Masal as leading minister. This period was plagued by uprisings and natural disasters, but al-Hafiz persevered until his death in October 1149. His successors would be reduced to puppets at the hands of powerful viziers, until the end of the Fatimid Caliphate in 1171.\n\nThe future al-Hafiz was born Abd al-Majid at Ascalon in 1074 or 1075. His father was Abu'l-Qasim Muhammad, a son of the reigning Fatimid caliph, al-Mustansir (). His early life, before he was thrust to the forefront of politics, is almost unknown. As an adult, he is reported to have shown a strong interest in astronomy, and to have kept several astronomers in his employ.\n\nOn 7 October 1130, Caliph al-Amir bi-Ahkam Allah () was assassinated. He left only a six-month-old son, Abu'l-Qasim al-Tayyib, to succeed him, with no designated regent or serving vizier, as al-Amir had resumed the personal direction of government affairs. Al-Amir's murder not only undid his attempts to once again concentrate power in the Caliph's hands instead of over-mighty generals and ministers, but also, given the fragility of succession, endangered the very survival of the Fatimid dynasty.\n\nAt this time, Abd al-Majid was the oldest surviving male of the dynasty. What happened next appears to have effectively been a coup: two of al-Amir's favourites, Hizar al-Mulk Hazarmard (or Jawarmard) and Barghash, who had influence over the army, allied themselves with Abd al-Majid, to control the government, Abd al-Majid was to become regent, while Hazarmard (winning out over Barghash) would become vizier, and the Armenian Abu'l-Fath Yanis as commander-in-chief and chamberlain to the regent. Hazarmard evidently hoped to establish himself as a quasi-sultan in the style of the all-powerful Armenian viziers Badr al-Jamali and al-Afdal Shahanshah while Abd al-Majid may have supported him with the aim of gaining the throne for himself. \n\nAs \"de facto\" head of state, Abd al-Majid used the title of , previously the formal title of the Fatimids' designated successor, but in this context to be understood as regent. It is unclear, however, in whose name this regency was exercised. Most sources report that the very existence of al-Amir's infant son was concealed, and al-Tayyib disappears completely from the record after that. How the existence of a child whose birth had, after all, been accompanied by public celebrations and proclamations, was so effectively concealed is unknown. Modern scholars speculate that may have died in infancy, possibly even before his father; but at least one contemporary, anonymous Syrian source, maintains that he was murdered on Abd al-Majid's orders. Instead of al-Tayyib, the new regime maintained that al-Amir had left a pregnant concubine, and that the caliph, having dreamed of his impending death, had declared this unborn child to be a son and his designated () successor, thus effectively bypassing al-Tayyib. What came of this pregnancy is likewise unclear, as different sources report that the concubine either bore a daughter or that the foetus could not be found.\nWhatever the ambitions and intentions of the leaders of the new regime were, they were cut short within a fortnight of al-Amir's death. At the ceremony of the new vizier's investiture, the army, assembled at the Bayn al-Qasrayn square between the caliphal palaces, rose in revolt and demanded the appointment of Kutayfat, the only surviving son of al-Afdal Shahanshah, as vizier. The palace was invaded, Hazarmard was executed and his severed head carried through the streets of Cairo, and on 21 October, Kutayfat was invested as vizier with the titles of his father and grandfather. Formally Abd al-Majid retained his position of regent, and coins and decrees were issued jointly in his name and that of Kutayfat, but in reality Abd al-Majid was held a prisoner in one of the palace treasuries, guarded by Ridwan ibn Walakhshi. Soon, however—possibly after the expected birth of a male heir did not occur—Kutayfat proclaimed the dynasty deposed, and abandoned Isma'ilism as the state religion. He instead proclaimed himself as the vicegerent of a shadowy \"Expected One\" () and \"Rightly-Guided\" () imam, who was given no name other than the Abu'l-Qasim. The medieval sources explain this as a turn to Twelver Shi'ism, but, as the historian Heinz Halm points out, this is nowhere explicitly attested in Kutayfat's own proclamations; rather, this was a political device which not only sidestepped the Fatimid claims to the imamate, but allowed him to rule, in the words of the historian Samuel Miklos Stern, \"as a dictator responsible to no one either in theory or practice\". Halm also considers that it was Kutayfat who at this point eliminated al-Tayyib.\n\nThe Fatimid elites were not prepared to accept these changes. Members of al-Amir's bodyguard assassinated Kutayfat in a counter-coup on 8 December 1131 and released Abd al-Majid from his prison. This restoration of the dynasty was thereafter commemorated annually, up until the end of the Fatimid Caliphate, as the \"Feast of Victory\" ().\n\nGiven his lack of legitimation as he was not in the line of succession to al-Amir, Abd al-Majid initially continued ruling as a regent, and the first coins of his reign were struck with him still bearing the title of . Whether Abd al-Majid had had designs on the caliphate or not, the lack of a direct heir meant that the continuation of the Fatimid dynasty and the Isma'ili imamate required that he succeed as imam and caliph, since according to Isma'ili doctrine, \"God does not leave the Moslem Community without an Imam to lead them on the right path\". This was done in a decree () on 23 January 1132, whereby Abd al-Majid assumed the title (\"Keeper of God's Religion\"). The fact that, for the first time in the Fatimid dynasty, power was not passed from father to a son, created an radical departure from established practice that had to be addressed and justified. Thus the proclaimed al-Hafiz's right to the imamate, likening it to the sun, which had been briefly eclipsed by al-Amir's death and Kutayfat's usurpation, but had now reappeared in accordance with the divine purpose. No reference to any son of al-Amir was made. Al-Hafiz claimed that he had—secretly—received the designation () as successor by al-Amir, and that Caliph al-Mustansir had foreseen this event, and had called al-Hafiz's father as . Earlier examples of breaks in the direct succession of the imamate, chiefly the designation by the Prophet Muhammad of his son-in-law Ali ibn Abi Talib, were brought up to buttress his claim.\n\nAlthough largely accepted by the Isma'ili faithful in the Fatimid domains in Egypt, Nubia, and the Levant, al-Hafiz's highly irregular accession and claims to the imamate were rebuffed by some communities, chiefly in the only other major Isma'ili realm, Yemen: there the hitherto staunchly pro-Fatimid Sulayhid dynasty broke up, with the Sulayhid queen, Arwa, upholding the rights of al-Tayyib, whose birth had been announced to her in a letter by al-Amir, while the regional dynasties of the Hamdanids and the Zurayids recognized al-Hafiz's claims.\n\nThe issue was not merely political, but, given the pivotal role of the imam in the Isma'ili faith, also intensely religious, since, in the words of Stern, \"on it depended the continuity of institutional religion as well as the personal salvation of the believer\". As a result, al-Hafiz's accession produced a major schism in the Musta'li branch of Isma'ilism, between the adherents of the imamate of al-Tayyib (the \"Tayyibis\") pitted against supporters of al-Hafiz and his successors (the \"Hafizis\"). The schism was analogous to the earlier Musta'li–Nizari schism in 1094/5, when, on the death of al-Mustansir, al-Afdal Shahanshah had raised al-Musta'li Billah to the caliphate instead of the designated heir, Nizar, leading to a brief civil war and Nizar's execution. While al-Musta'li had been recognized by the Fatimid establishment and the Isma'ili communities dependent on it in Syria and Yemen, the Iranian Isma'ilis largely had adopted Nizar's claims to the imamate and broken off their relations with the Fatimids. As Stern emphasized, in both cases the issue was \"not so much the person of the claimant that weighed with his followers; they were not moved by any superior merits of Nizar as a ruler (this is, of course, obvious in the case of the infant al-Tayyib) — it was the divine right personified in the legitimate heir that counted\".\n\nThus, by 1132 the once unified Isma'ili movement had split into three branches: the Hafizi, which now became the official doctrine of the Fatimid realm, the Tayyibi, which mostly survived in the mountains of Yemen, and the Nizari. Apart from Yemen, Tayyibi supporters existed in Egypt as well as in the Levant, but they were apparently heavily persecuted by the Fatimids. The Hafizi branch, inextricably bound to the Fatimid regime, survived in Egypt until the fall of the Fatimid Caliphate in 1171, but it disappeared quickly after, unlike its two rivals, which survive to the present day. The last holdout of Hafizi Isma'ilism was Yemen, where significant communities survived into the 13th century.\n\nThe accession of al-Hafiz signalled the restoration of the authority of the Fatimid dynasty and the caliph, but the preceding events had shaken the regime's foundations. The caliph enjoyed little authority over the army, and al-Hafiz's reign was marred by chronic instability, having to fend off rebellions and challenges to his legitimacy from ambitious warlords and even from within his own family. To bolster his legitimacy, al-Hafiz resorted among other things to converting the Shi'a festival of Ghadir Khumm into a festival celebrating the Fatimids. Despite his weak position, al-Hafiz succeeded in remaining on the throne for almost two decades.\n\nAs with his predecessors, al-Hafiz appointed viziers to run the government in his name, but the power concentrated into the office's hands since the days of Badr al-Jamali made it a danger even to the caliph, and al-Hafiz paid particular attention to his viziers' activities. Indeed, for the last decade of his reign, he did not appoint any viziers, but instead relied on high-ranking clerks as \"ad hoc\" directors of government affairs.\n\nHis first vizier was the Armenian Yanis, a former military slave of al-Afdal and thus representative of the same army factions that had raised Kutayfat to power. Yanis had already occupied high offices under al-Amir, including chamberlain (), a post almost as powerful as the vizierate. To enforce his own authority, he executed half of al-Amir's bodyguard and formed a private army, the . His growing power alarmed the Caliph; when Yanis died after nine months in office in late 1132, it was said that the Caliph had had him poisoned.\n\nAfter Yanis' death, the position of vizier was left vacant. Al-Hafiz also dismissed the long-serving head of the (\"bureau of verification\"), responsible for overseeing the financial administration, Yuhanna ibn Abi'l-Layth, and used the opportunity to enlist the support of the families, by appointing the Mu'tamid al-Dawla as head of the bureau, and his brother as . Al-Hafiz also had to confront a revolt of troops in the eastern Nile Delta, as well as an unexpected danger: al-Husayn, one of the sons of Nizar (the eponymous cause of the Nizari schism) who had fled to the Maghreb upon his father's execution, left his exile to return to Egypt. He managed to gather an army, but al-Hafiz successfully suborned one of his officers to assassinate him before he reached the country.\n\nAt the same time, the Caliph sought to bolster the Fatimid credentials in the eyes of the Muslim world by once again taking up the mantle of champions of the against the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem: taking advantage of the revolt of Hugh II of Jaffa against King Fulk of Jerusalem (), after the long hiatus caused by the loss of Tyre in 1124, the Fatimids resumed their attacks on the Crusader territories from their stronghold at Ascalon. As a result, Fulk was forced to construct a series of new castles—Chastel Arnoul (1133), Beth Gibelin (1137), Ibelin (1141), and Blanchegarde (1142)—to protect the Jaffa–Jerusalem road and provide security for Western settlers. These fortresses shifted the balance in the Crusaders' favour, as they placed the Fatimid garrison of Ascalon in a defensive position. With the fortification of Gaza in 1150, the city was entirely cut off from land, paving the way for its capture by the Crusaders in 1153.\n\nIn 1134, al-Hafiz appointed his own son and designated heir, Sulayman, as vizier. A move designed to further strengthen the dynasty, it backfired disastrously when Sulayman died two months later, thereby once more throwing doubt on the supposed infallibility of the caliph-imam. Sulayman's younger brother Haydara was immediately appointed to him as heir and vizier, but this provoked the jealousy of another of al-Hafiz's sons, Hasan.\n\nHasan won the backing of the , a regiment of apparently Armenian origin established by Badr and al-Afdal that had been the pillar of their power and that had also supported Kutayfat, while the Caliph and Haydara were backed by the Black African regiment of the . This dissension appears to have had religious motivation as well, as Hasan and his followers are said to have backed Sunnism and attacked Isma'ili preachers. On 28 June, the defeated the , forcing Haydara to flee to the palace, which was now besieged by Hasan's troops. Faced with this unprecedented situation, al-Hafiz backed down and on 19 July, he appointed appoint Hasan as vizier and heir, effectively, as the historian Michael Brett comments, \"in opposition to himself\".\n\nTo secure his position, Hasan organized a private militia, the , with which he terrorized the elites. Al-Hafiz instigated the Black African garrison of Upper Egypt to try and depose his son, but again Hasan's men emerged victorious. In the end, it was Hasan's tyrannical rule that caused his downfall: the brutal treatment of his enemies, the executions of prominent men and the confiscations of property cost him whatever support he may have had. Following the murder of several senior commanders, the army rose in revolt in March 1135. Hasan fled to the caliphal palace, where al-Hafiz placed him under arrest; but the troops assembled at the square before the palace and demanded his execution, otherwise threatening to set fire to the palace. Al-Hafiz called for his rescue to the governor of the Gharbiyya province, Bahram al-Armani, but before he could arrive in the capital, the Caliph bowed to the soldiers' demands and had his son poisoned by his Jewish physician. The troops did not disperse, however, until one of their own was invited in to inspect the body; for good measure, he knifed it several times before departing.\n\nHasan was succeeded by another Armenian general, Bahram. Al-Hafiz had called upon Bahram, then provincial governor of Gharbiyya (the western Nile Delta), for aid against his son. Arriving in Cairo soon after the murder of Hasan, Bahram, although a Christian, was named vizier on 4 April 1135 and received the title of \"Sword of Islam\" (). The appointment of a Christian to the post of vizier, which was seen as the representative of the imam-caliph, and which entailed ritual roles in Islamic ceremonies and precedence over Muslim clerics, raised much opposition among the Muslims. Al-Hafiz persisted with his appointment, but gave him a dispensation to absent himself from ritual ceremonies, in which the vizier's role was taken over by the chief . He also did not receive the customary titles of the Fatimid viziers implying control over the Muslim religious establishment ( and ).\n\nHowever, the Muslim population continued to oppose Bahram, because he showed favour to Christians of all denominations, allowing for the conferment of privileges on churches and construction of new ones, and encouraged Armenian immigration, which in a short time is said to have reached 30,000 people. His brother, Vasak, was appointed governor of Qus in Upper Egypt, and his government was said to be tyrannical towards the local population. In foreign policy, Bahram's tenure inaugurated a period of peace, since the Crusader states of the Levant were occupied with the growing threat of Zengi, the Turkish atabeg of Mosul. Bahram even presided over the release of 300 captives held since the Battle of Ramla in 1102. The vizier appears to have entertained good relations, and possibly formed an alliance, with King Roger II of Sicily.\n\nIn the meantime, the Muslim backlash against Bahram grew. His post as vizier was already considered an insult, but the favour shown to Christians, the Armenian immigration, and his close relations to Christian powers further inflamed passions. Ridwan ibn Walakhshi, the Caliph's former gaoler, emerged as the movement's leader. Ridwan was a Sunni who had risen to be one of the leading military commanders under al-Amir, and now held the position of . Bahram tried to dispose of him by sending him to govern Ascalon in May 1135, but there Ridwan busied himself with blocking the Armenian immigration, earning plaudits from the Cairenes. As a result, Bahram recalled him in November 1136 and sent him to govern his own former province at Gharbiyya. This was a mistake, as Ridwan now possessed an independent power base: leading Cairene officials began making contact with him, and Ridwan did not hesitate to preach against Bahram from the pulpit of the mosque. Finally, in early 1137 Ridwan raised an army from the local Bedouin and marched on Cairo. Bahram's Muslim soldiers deserted him, and on 3 February he fled Cairo with 2,000 Armenian soldiers, making for Qus. After his departure, an anti-Armenian pogrom broke out in the capital, and even the vizier's palace was plundered.\n\nAt Qus, Bahram found his brother killed and defiled by the local townfolk. In revenge, Bahram plundered the city, but resisted calls to torch it so as not to fully alienate the caliph. He then made for Aswan on the southern border of the Fatimid realm—some sources claim that he had intended to found a new realm allied with the Christian kingdoms of Nubia to the south—but the local governor barred his gates to him, and Bahram was forced to retreat to Akhmim. There a letter from al-Hafiz reached him, offering him lenient terms: he could choose either a governorship at Qus, Akhmim, or Asyut, but could keep only a fraction of his followers, or he could enter a monastery near Akhmim, with a letter of protection () for himself and his relatives. Bahram chose the latter.\n\nThe Caliph's leniency towards Bahram is not surprising, as the Christian vizier was by far not as threatening to his own position as the Sunni Ridwan, who, in the words of Michael Brett, \"promised to be a second Nasir al-Dawla, threatening to turn the country over, not to Twelver Shi'ism like Kutayfat, but to Sunnism\". Indeed, when Ridwan took office on 5 February 1137, his titles reflected his dangerously powerful position: the new vizier was not only, like Bahram, the \"Sword of Islam\", and once again, being a Muslim, head of the 's () and the 's ); instead of \"Most Mighty and Excellent Lord\" (), he was now \"Most Excellent King\" (), and thus essentially a monarch independent of the caliph-imam. Ridwan's appointment thus marks the culmination of a process that made the Fatimid viziers into sultans, just as the Seljuk rulers had been vis-à-vis the Abbasid caliphs since the time of Tughril.\n\nNow vizier, Ridwan launched an anti-Christian persecution. Christian officials were replaced with Muslims, their properties confiscated, and some were even executed. Restrictive and discriminatory sumptuary laws and regulations were introduced for Christians and Jews, requiring them to wear specific clothes, prohibiting them from riding horses, dismount when passing by a mosque, etc. The poll tax () was redefined, and now required to be paid to a bench set at head height, as a sign of inferiority. Bahram's Armenian troops were disbanded, either settled as peasants or allowed to leave Egypt and return to their homeland. At the same time, Ridwan promoted Sunnism: a Shafi'i was established in Alexandria on the Syrian model. Ridwan also continued correspondence with the Burids, particularly Shams al-Dawla Muhammad of Baalbek, for a common front against the Crusaders, but also possibly with the aim of using the Sunni Syrians to unseat the Fatimid dynasty.\n\nIn 1138 Ridwan began a cautious process of removing al-Hafiz from power altogether, by consulting a Sunni (the head of the Alexandria , Ibn Awf), a Twelver (Ibn Abi Kamil), and an Isma'ili jurist (the chief Isma'il ibn Salama) on the possibility of deposing al-Hafiz. Their answers were fairly predictable: Ibn Abi Kamil argued that the claim to the imamate by al-Hafiz and his ancestors was false, Ibn Salama supported the Caliph, and Ibn Awf took a more cautious stance and advised that the deposition should be handled in accordance with religious law. Ridwan began arresting and executing members of the Caliph's entourage, while al-Hafiz demonstratively recalled Bahram from exile and allowed him to settle in the palace. Ridwan in turn appeared in public on the Eid al-Fitr on 31 May wearing a robe in a style normally reserved for monarchs.\nMatters came to a head on 8 June, as al-Hafiz, enthroned atop the Golden Gate of the palace, engaged in a heated exchange with Ridwan below. The vizier then ordered the palaces surrounded by troops, and brought forth one of the Caliph's sons, aiming to place him on the throne. This failed as the palace remained closed to him, and due to the resistance of Ibn Salama, who insisted that only the imam could sanction his successor by conferring upon him. This impasse allowed al-Hafiz to regain the initiative. The turncoat son and his followers were killed, and on 12 June a group of twenty men of the caliphal bodyguard entered the city through the Zuwayla Gate shouting \"al-Hafiz, the Victorious\" (). They were quickly joined by the populace and the bulk of the army, which rose in revolt against Ridwan. It was only with the assistance of his brother and nephew, and some loyal troops of the , that allowed Ridwan to break through and escape the city via the Victory Gate, as the vizier's palace was once more plundered by the mob behind him.\n\nAided by the Bedouin in his employ, Ridwan fled to Ascalon and the Burid domains. The Burid governor of Salkhad, Kumushtakin, gave him a force of Turks, with whom he returned to Egypt. Rallying the Bedouin around him, he marched on Cairo, but was repulsed before the city gates in 28 August 1139. A month later, al-Hafiz led his army, comprising the and regiments and his own bodyguard, to defeat Ridwan's forces. Ridwan fled to Upper Egypt, but soon had to surrender himself to the Caliph's forces against an . Al-Hafiz had Ridwan interned in the palace, in the room next to Bahram's.\n\nAfter Ridwan's downfall, al-Hafiz offered to reappoint Bahram as vizier, but the latter refused. He remained al-Hafiz's closest aide, however, and on his death in November 1140, al-Hafiz in person participated in the funeral cortège. For the remainder of his reign, al-Hafiz no longer appointed any viziers, but rather chose secretaries () to lead the administration. At some point in 1139/40, the Berber Salim ibn Masal, was appointed as leading minister, but the vizieral title was deliberately avoided, and he was titled \"supervisor of affairs\" () or \"supervisor of the public interests\" (). Ibn Masal would be named vizier only after al-Hafiz's death. This was a deliberate attempt to reverse the progressive transformation of the vizierate into a sultanate: unlike the viziers, these secretaries were civilian bureaucrats, often non-Muslim, and utterly dependent on the Caliph.\n\nThe first of these secretaries was the Egyptian Christian Abu Zakari, who had been appointed as \"supervisor of the buraeus\" (, likely indicating the head of the ) by Bahram and been dismissed and exiled by Ridwan. Al-Hafiz restored him to his position, and awarded him the title \"Protege of the Caliphate\" (). He appears to have used his position as head of the fiscal administration to contract for tax revenues and appropriate the surplus income for himself, and in 1145 he was arrested and executed at the Caliph's orders along with his father and brother. Muslim writers denigrated Abu Zakari as \"the Slit-Nosed One\" (), twisting his honorific (\"the Most Noble One\"). It is perhaps this anti-Christian animus that explains why his two successors were both Muslim 's who had served under Ridwan. The first, Abu'l-Karam al-Tinnisi, received the title of \"the Successful One\" (), and held the post for two years, until September 1147. He was replaced by Muhammad ibn al-Husayn al-Tarabulusi, surnamed \"the Chosen One\" (). Al-Tarabulusi was also appointed head of the chancery, and given quasi-vizieral prerogatives: he was allowed to wear the tail of his turban () in a style reserved for palace eunuchs, and attended the caliph at the Friday prayer.\n\nIn foreign affairs, al-Hafiz's final decade was largely peaceful, if only because the Fatimids and the Kingdom of Jerusalem were preoccupied with internal troubles; and because the Crusaders were preoccupied with Zengi. In April/May 1141, Crusader knights appeared before Ascalon, but were chased away by the Fatimid garrison. In 1142/3, Fatimid envoys visited the court of Roger II of Sicily, whose fleet had subdued the old Fatimid capital of al-Mahdiya on the coast of Ifriqiya, and whose expansionist plans there unfolded over the following years. Despite the possible danger posed by the Christian expansion into North Africa, and incidents where Norman warships captured Egyptian merchant vessels, relations remained cordial. The chronicler Romuald of Salerno even records the conclusion of a commercial treaty between Egypt and Sicily in 1143 According to Heinz Halm, Roger's decision to abstain from the Second Crusade may have played a role in maintaining friendly relations until both monarchs died. Further embassies are recorded into Yemen in 1144, and to Damascus in 1147, apparently to make common cause against the ambitions of Zengi's son, Nur al-Din. Given the continuing troubles in Egypt, however, any thought of a Fatimid intervention in Syria remained an impossibility.\n\nThe last years of al-Hafiz's reign were dominated by domestic challenges that laid bare the unstable foundations of his authority. In 1144/5, one of al-Hafiz's uncles, Abu'l-Husayn, tried to gain the support of the for his own bid to the caliphate, promising to make him vizier as a reward. The , Khumartash, informed al-Hafiz, who had his uncle thrown into prison. In 1146, the commander Bakhtiyar rebelled in Upper Egypt,and had to be defeated by a force of Luwata Berbers from the Western Desert. In May 1148, Ridwan managed to escape from his confinement in the palace, cross the Nile, and rally followers to his banner, including Bedouin, regular soldiers, and Luwata. With this army he marched once more on Cairo, defeated the Caliph's troops and pursued them into the city itself. Al-Hafiz barred the gates of the palace, but pretended to be cooperative, and even sent some money when Ridwan asked for it to pay his men. At the same time, the Caliph selected ten Black African members of the caliphal bodyguard to assassinate Ridwan. Shouting \"al-Hafiz, the Victorious\", they attacked and killed him and his brother near the Aqmar Mosque. In 1149, another pretender, a supposed son of Nizar, gathered Berber supporters—Luwata and even some Kutama, once the mainstay of the early Fatimid dynasty—to attack Alexandria. The rebels scored a victory against the first army sent to confront them, but in the event the rebellion was ended when al-Hafiz bribed the Luwata chieftains to withdraw with money and promises of land grants in the Nile Delta. The pretender's severed head was sent to Cairo. And in 1149, once again the rival military factions, the and the , clashed in the streets of Cairo, so that people were afraid to enter the capital; the emerged victorious and drove their opponents out of the city to Giza. These years were also visited by natural disasters: the Nile floods were particularly low in 1139, while mine and pestilence ravaged Egypt in 1142. In 1148, the Nile flood was too high, with the water reaching to the very gates of Cairo.\n\nAl-Hafiz died in October 1149 of a severe intestinal colic. His survival on the throne through all the threats he had faced was remarkable, and he had managed to restore the caliph's personal control over the administration to an extent unseen for a century. But on his death he left behind a severely shaken regime, which survived more thanks to inertia and the vested interests of large sections of society in keeping it running. The Isma'ili mission, which had once animated the early Fatimid expansion, had lost its drive, and the dynasty's very legitimacy was increasingly challenged. The Fatimid empire during his reign had shrunk to Egypt, and the parts of Yemen and Makuria that recognized its overlordship; and beyond its borders, Zengi and Nir al-Din were building in Syria a militantly Sunni regime whose ideological zeal was making itself felt across the region. Egypt would become the prize in the conflict between the Nur al-Din and the Crusaders, leading to the final collapse of the Fatimid dynasty.\n\nAl-Hafiz was succeeded by his 17-year-old son Abu Mansur Isma'il, with the regnal name al-Zafir bi-Amr Allah. Al-Hafiz was the last Fatimid caliph who rose to the throne as an adult; the last three Fatimid imam-caliphs until the end of the dynasty in 1171 were little more than puppet rulers, with real power lying in the hands of their viziers.\n\n"}

{"id": "2234066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2234066", "title": "Grand Combin", "text": "Grand Combin\n\nThe Grand Combin is a mountain massif in the western Pennine Alps in Switzerland. With its highest summit, the \"Combin de Grafeneire\", it is one of the highest peaks in the Alps and the second most prominent of its range. The Grand Combin is also a large glaciated massif consisting of several summits, among which three are above 4000 metres (\"Combin de Grafeneire\" , \"Combin de Valsorey\" , \"Combin de la Tsessette\" ).\n\nThe normal route starts from the Panossière Hut, which lies on the north side in the Corbassière valley. Despite the fact that no major difficulties exist, a particularly dangerous passage has to be traversed on the north flank: \"Le Corridor\". It is a couloir dominated by seracs continuously falling on it.\n\nThe massif of the Grand Combin lies south of Verbier between the Val d'Entremont (west) and Val de Bagnes (west). The north-western facing side of Grand Combin is entirely covered by eternal snows and glaciers which are prone to serac falls. The southern and eastern walls are more steep and thus exempt of snow.\n\nThe topography of the Grand Combin is intricate. Between the Val d'Entremont and the Val de Bagnes are two high ridges, nearly parallel to each other and to those valleys, which both diverge from a short transverse ridge of great height. The southern end of the space enclosed between these three ridges is an elevated plateau of great extent, where the snows accumulate and feed the Corbassière Glacier which descends thence for about ten kilometers to the north. The glacier is surrounded by the peaks of Petit Combin, Combin de Corbassière and Combin de Boveire on the west, Grand Tavé and Tournelon Blanc on the east. Smaller glaciers lie on the external flanks such as Boveire and Mont Durand Glacier.\n\nAt the south-east extremity of the plateau, the highest part of the enclosing ridge is surmounted by two conical summits, of which the higher south-west point (\"Grand Combin de Grafeneire\") is 4,314 meters in height, while the neighbouring north-east summit (Aiguille du Croissant) is lower by less than 60 meters (4,260 metres). Two other minor summits over 4,000 metres are located on the ridge: the Grand Combin de Valsorey (4184 m) on the west and the Combin de la Tsessette (4135 m) on the east. On the west side, the plateau sinks to a considerably lower level, and over this lies the Col des Maisons Blanches (3,418 m), by which access to the Corbassiere valley is obtained from the side of the Val d'Entremont.\n\nAll the waters flowing on the region end up in the Dranse river and the Rhone. After Dom, Weisshorn, it is the highest massif of the Alps situated out of the main chain. South of the Grand Combin, the ridge separating the glaciers of Mont Durand and Sonadon reaches the Grande Tête de By a few kilometres away, which is located on the main watershed. The ridge diverges to the south-west and appears to be continuous with the range of the Aiguilles Vertes, or Aiguilles de Valsorey, and that of Mont Vélan. From this branches the lower range, which divides the channel of the Glacier du Mont Durand (north) from the Val d'Ollomont in the Aosta Valley (south), and extends by the Col de Fenêtre to the Mont Gelé.\n\nThe Grand Combin, which yields in height to only a few European mountains, was long one of the least known of Alpine summits. The first to commence the exploration of the great massif which separates the Val de Bagnes from the Val d'Entremont was Gottlieb Samuel Studer, of Berne, who on August 14, 1851 reached for the first time the summit of the Combin de Corbassière with the guide Joseph-Benjamin Fellay, and has published an account of that and a subsequent excursion in \"Bergund Gletscher-Fahrten\". He was followed in that ascent five years later by W. and C. E. Mathews, and in 1857, William Mathews anticipated Studer in the ascent of the second peak of the Grand Combin.\n\nThe first four expeditions on Grand Combin reached only the minor summit east of Grand Combin (\"Aiguille du Croissant\"). The first one was made by mountain guides from the valley (Maurice Fellay and Jouvence Bruchez) on July 20, 1857. The first complete ascent of Grand Combin was finally made on July 30, 1859 by Charles Sainte-Claire Deville with Daniel, Emmanuel and Gaspard Balleys, and Basile Dorsaz.\n\nThe Grand Combin de Valsoray on the west was reached for the first time on 16 September 1872 by J. H. Isler and J. Gillioz. They climbed the south south face above the Plateau du Couloir. The itinerary on the south-east ridge was opened on 10 September 1891 by O. Glynne Jones, A.Bovier and P. Gaspoz.\n\n\n\n"}

The capital city was destroyed by the invading Gurkha army and only the ruins of the palace and the chortens are seen here now. However, the ruins of this city are seen close to Pelling and in West Sikkim district in the Northeastern Indian state of present-day Sikkim; Pemayangtse Monastery is one of the oldest monasteries in Sikkim which is close to the ruins. From the vantage point of this former capital, superb views of the Khanchendzonga ranges can be witnessed. This monument has been declared as of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India. It was first established in 1670 by Chadok Namgyal son of Phuntsog Namgyal by shifting from the first capital of Yuksom that was consecrated in 1642.\n\nThe Rabdentse ruins are part of Buddhist religious pilgrimage circuit starting with the first monastery at Yuksom known as the Dubdi Monastery, followed by Norbugang Chorten, Tashiding Monastery, the Pemayangtse Monastery, the Sanga Choeling Monastery, and the Khecheopalri Lake.\n\nPhuntsog Namgyal, the first Chogyal or King of Sikkim, was consecrated as king of Sikkim at Yuksom and succeeded by his son, Tensung Namgyal in 1670. The reign of the Chogyal was peaceful and saw the capital shifted from Yuksom to Rabdentse. The Namgyal had three wives – a Tibetan, a Bhutanese and a Limbu girl. The Limbu girl, daughter of the Limbu chief Yo Yo-Hang had inducted seven girls from her family who all married into noble Sikkim families. Many of them became councillors to the King and were given the title \"Kazi\", which gave them enormous powers and privileges.\n\nThe king's second wife's son Chador Namgyal, took over the reins of power in Sikkim, after his father’s death, in 1700. He was a minor at that time. This outraged his elder half-sister Pendiongmu (daughter of first wife of Tensung Namgyal), of Bhutanese descent, who opposed the succession and with help from Bhutan evicted Chador. Chador fled to Tibet (Yungthing Yeshe, a loyal Minister escorted the minor king to Lhasa) where he remained in exile for ten years before returning and reclaiming his lost territory with the help of the Tibetans.\n\nWhile in Lhasa, Chador Namgyal became very proficient in Buddhism and Tibetan literature, and also became the state astrologer to the Sixth Dalai Lama. During his exile, the Sixth Dalai Lama pleased with the erudition of Chador Namgyal had conferred on him exclusive rights to an estate in Tibet. During this period, the son of Yugthing Yeshe (who had saved Chador and taken him to Tibet) was imprisoned by the Bhutanese in Rabdentse. Tibet intervened in the matter and also prevailed on King Deb of Bhutan to withdraw from Sikkim. Chador Namgyal then returned to Rebdantse and the small forces of Bhutan which remained were forced to withdraw. During this period, Sikkim lost some areas in its south-eastern region since Bhutan had colonized the area.\n\nPedi, the Chogyal’s half sister, had not given up on her enmity against her half brother Chador. With the help of a medicinal man from Tibet she got Chador Namgyal murdered in 1716 through a mysterious blood letting from a main artery while the king was on a holiday at the Ralang hot water spring. Immediately, the royal armed forces executed the Tibetan doctor and also put Pedi to death by strangling her with a silk scarf.\n\nGurmed Namgyal succeeded his father Chadok in 1717. Gurmed's reign saw many skirmishes between the Nepalese and Sikkimese. He had Rabdentse fortified to prevent invasions by the Gurkhas (Nepalese) and Bhutanese. In addition, a local Magar chieftain Tashi Bidur had also rebelled, but was subdued. Gurmed died in 1733 at a young age of 26. Since he did not have any legitimate children, on his death bed he conveyed that a nun at Sanga Cheoling was carrying his child (this is said to be the story concocted by the Lamas to perpetuate the Namgyal Dynasty). Subsequently, the nun gave birth to a male child who was accepted as heir to Gurmed and was given the name Phuntsog, after the first temporal and the spiritual head of Sikkim.\n\nPhunstog Namgyal II, the illegitimate child of Gurmed, succeeded his father to the throne in 1733. His reign was tumultuous as he was faced with attacks by the Bhutanese and the Nepalese, apart from rebellions within Sikkim from Magars and the Tsongs in 1752. Since Namgyal II was a weak king, the Nepalese had made 17 invasions against Sikkim. Bhutan had also attacked Sikkim and occupied areas east of Tista River; however, they later withdrew to present frontiers after negotiations held at Rhenock.\n\nTenzing Namgyal, the next king was also a weak ruler, and his sovereignty saw most of Sikkim being appropriated by Nepal. The Chogyal was forced to flee from Rabdentse to Lhasa where he died in 1780. Tshudpud Namgyal, his son returned to Sikkim in 1793 to reclaim the throne with the help of China. Finding Rabdentse too close to the Nepalese border, he shifted the capital to Tumlong. Consequent to the repeated attacks by the Bhutanese and Nepalese over the many invasions, the capital city was reduced to ruins by the liberating army of Nepal.\n\nThe ruins seen now in Rabdentse consist mainly of \"chunky wall stubs\" whose heritage value is accentuated by its location on a ridge, near upper Pelling ( away) from where commanding views of the Kanchendzong hill ranges and surroundings on one side and the mountains and valleys on the other side are visible. The approach to this location is from an ornamental yellow gate near the Pelling–Geyshing road, from where it is a walking distance of about 15 minutes through a lake and forested hills.\n\nAlong the trek path from the gate, an avenue of chestnut trees with sodden moss leads to a stone throne comprising three standing stones called as \"Namphogang\", which was the pulpit of the judges from where judgments were pronounced during the active days of the king's reign from Rabdentse. Further ahead, the 'Taphap Chorten' is seen in semi ruined condition. This was the entry point to the Palace and people seeking access to the palace had to dismount from their horses and remove their hat as a mark of respect to the King here. The palace ruins are at the centre of the fourth courtyard.\n\nThe ruins of the palace are made up two of the northern and southern wings. The northern wing was the residence of the royal family. This wing has an open quadrangle where the \"Dab Lhagang\", now in ruins, is also seen; the Royal family used to offer prayers with incense to their deities here. A white marble slab of size x (reported to have been shifted from the river and carried by single person ) is also seen at this location, which was once the location of the monastery known as \"Risum Gompa\".\n\nNext to the ruins of the palace are three \"chortens\", religious sites where members of the royal family offered incense to the deities. The chortens are in a fair state of preservation. On the southern wing, common people were given an audience by the king, which is obvious from the stone throne seen here. The Archaeological Survey of India has declared Rabdentse as a heritage monument and has undertaken the needed preservation and restoration measures.\n\n\n"}

In 1988, Breukink won the youth competition in the Tour de France. In 1990, Breukink reached the podium in Paris, finishing 3rd in the 1990 Tour de France. Most recently, he served as the manager of the team.\n\nBorn in Rheden, Breukink was born in a cycling family, as his father Willem Breukink was director of the Gazelle bicycle factory. Despite this, he chose to be a footballer. In 1980 he changed to pursue a cycling career. In 1982, this appeared to be a good choice, when he won the Dutch national pursuit championship for juniors. At the 1984 Olympic Games, Erik Breukink competed with Gert Jakobs, Maarten Ducrot and Jos Alberts in the 100 km Team Pursuit and finish fourth place. In 1985, Breukink won 2 time trial stages in Olympia's Tour, and finished 3rd place overall. He decided to switch to a professional career.\n\nBreukink made his debut as a pro in 1986 for the Skala-Gazelle team. He turned out to be a time trial specialist and was a good climber. In his Tour de France debut in 1987, he won one stage and finished second in the young rider classification. His real breakthrough in the major courses was the 1988 Giro d'Italia, where he debuted with a 2nd place, winning the Gavia Pass stage in a snowstorm. In the 1988 Tour de France he won the young rider classification and finished 13th place. In the 1989 Tour de France, he showed his time trial skills by winning the prologue, and wearing the yellow jersey for one day. In that year's Giro d'Italia, he almost won, but lost the lead in the Dolomites due to hunger.\nIn 1990, Breukink wanted to focus on the Tour de France, so he switched to the PDM team, that allowed him to do so. In the 1990 Tour de France, the result was good, winning two stages and finishing 3rd overall. The result could even have been better, but Breukink suffered from some bad luck: in the climb to the Tourmalet Breukink had to switch bicycles three times.\nIn 1991, Breukink together with the entire PDM-team had to leave the tour ranked 3rd, officially due to food poisoning, but it was later exposed that it was due to Intralipid. \nIn 1992, he appeared weak, especially in his favourite time trials. In 1993, Breukink switched to the team, where his performance improved again. Bad luck followed him however, as just before the start of the 1993 Tour de France, he was hit by a car test riding the new Lotus 110. The damage to his left knee caused him to give up during the Tour.\nBreukink rode the Tour de France four times afterwards, but never reached his old level. In 1997 he ended his professional cycling career, having ridden 11 Tours de France and won 4 stages. He garnered 61 career victories in total.\n\nAfter one year as a Public Relations officer for the Rabobank-team, Breukink started as co-commentator for the NOS, covering the Tour de France. In 2002 and 2003, the GP Erik Breukink, a UCI level 2.3 course, was run, with Erik Dekker and Fabian Cancellara as winners, but it was discontinued in 2004 due to financial problems.\n\nOn 13 January 2004, it was announced that Erik Breukink started as a team manager for the team. Thanks to his ONCE-years, Erik Breukink speaks Spanish fluently, which is helpful to communicate with the Spanish cyclists in the Rabobank team and cyclist Denis Menchov, who also speaks Spanish better than English. Since Breukink became team manager, the Rabobank cycling team's successes have included Paris–Tours, Milan–San Remo, the Brabantse Pijl (3x), the Tirreno–Adriatico (2x), the Tour de Romandie, the final classification and three stages in the Vuelta a España, 6 stages in the Tour de France and the mountains classification (2x) in the Tour de France.\nOn, 20 July 2006, Breukink received the \"médaille de la fidélité\" from the Tour de France organisation, because he had been present in the Tour de France for 20 years.

He served on the Houston City Council, served two terms as Mayor of Houston, and served three terms in the Texas House of Representatives.\n\nJohn Thomas Browne was born March 23, 1845 in Ballylanders, County Limerick, Ireland to Michael and Winifred (Hennessy) Browne. His family emigrated to the United States in October 1851. Not long after arriving in New Orleans, his father died. In 1852, Winifred relocated with her five children to Houston, Texas to be closer to family of her mother. Winifred's Irish uncle, Patrick Hayes, was an herbal medicine doctor and farmer in Madison County, Texas.\n\nBrowne spent much of the 1850s on Spann Plantation in Washington County, Texas at the behest of Father Gunnard, where he also received an education. At age fourteen in 1859, he left the plantation, and found work hauling bricks in Madison County, Texas. He returned to Houston to first work as a baggage hauler, then performed messenger duties for Commercial and Southwestern Express Company before settling in at the Houston and Texas Central Railroad. The 1860 Census listed John residing with his mother in Houston's Fourth Ward.\n\nCorrection: The tombstone of Mayor John T. Browne in the City of Houston actually states that he served in Company A, 36 Texas Cavalry. Family history passed down that he was seriously wounded in a major battle of the Civil War, but recovered fully.\nBrowne joined the Confederacy, officially serving in Company B of the Second Texas Infantry. He served in Houston, detached from his unit, maintaining employment with the Houston and Texas Central Railroad, but in a new capacity as a fireman. He was briefly dispatched to the defense of Galveston, Texas. He was officially released from military duty in Houston on June 27, 1865.\n\nBrowne returned to messenger service in Houston after the Civil War. He worked for Adams Express Company, then for Southern Express Company. He transitioned into the grocery business first as a bookkeeper and clerk for H.P. Levy.\n\nBrowne married Mary Jane \"Mollie\" Bergin on September 13, 1871. They were the first marriage to be recorded at Annunciation Catholic Church. In 1872, Browne and Charles Bollfrass started a business as wholesale and retail grocers with $500 in capital. By the early 1890s, this grocery was amassing about $340,000 in annual sales.\n\nHe was a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians and the Knights of Columbus.\n\nBrowne was elected to Houston City Council, representing the Fifth Ward while chairing the Finance Committee in 1887. He ran for Mayor of Houston in 1892. He won in a landslide: 3900 to 600. During his time as mayor he lived in the Fifth Ward. \nBrowne's first term as Mayor of Houston began the same year as the Panic of 1893. He had campaigned on a platform of balancing the budget. The City of Houston ran budget deficits during Browne's first term, but these deficits were proportionately lower than those in previous years. Browne had been an advocate for lowering municipal utility bills through municipal ownership of the utilities. However, estimates for the City of Houston to build its own waterworks and electrical power plant had gone up to a range $500,000 to $900,000. Browne abandoned this option while favoring a policy of dedicating all capital spending on street paving and sewerage. The Browne administration also hired a city planning expert to study demands based hypothetically on a population of 75,000.\n\nMayor Browne proposed converting the Houston Volunteer Firefighters to a professional department under municipal management. The City of Houston would need to buy existing equipment and horses from the volunteer department, but could lease firehouses and would not be required to buy them. Houston City Council drafted an ordinance and passed it.\n\nIn April 1895, the Texas Supreme Court ruling in \"Higgins v. Bordages\", \"held that special assessment tax liens were unenforceable against urban homesteads.\" The City of Houston imposed special tax levies for road and sewerage projects on owners of property abutting the sections of street being improved. The ruling effectively removed the only tool the city had for enforcing payment of the special assessments by homeowners. Road construction contractors stopped all work because they feared the city would not pay them. Many homeowners stopped paying their assessment bills.\n\nTo meet this immediate revenue crisis, the Browne administration devised a plan to issue $500,000 in municipal bonds to be sold over a three to four-year period. The Labor Council opposed the bonding measure, and organized to defeat the measure when the referendum made it to the ballot. The City of Houston would need to find another way to compensate for $300,000 in uncollected taxes.\n\nBrowne represented Houston in the Texas House of Representatives from 1897 to 1899, and again in 1907.\n\nBrowne died August 19, 1941 died of pneumonia in Houston. He was buried at Glenwood Cemetery in Houston. He was survived by six children and thirty-eight grand children.\n\nIn 1979 his former residence in the Fifth Ward was used by an Italian American-owned grocery, Orlando's Grocery.\n"}

The party mainly endorses perennial candidate Dr. Walter Muñoz Céspedes, a San Jose medical doctor and five times presidential candidate, normally with testimonial results surrounding 1% or less of the votes. In the past 2018 election it endorsed the candidacy of former minister and defense lawyer Juan Diego Castro reaching 9% of the vote, although Castro and the party angrily split pathways soon after the election.\n\nThe party first contested general elections in 1998, in which it won a single seat, taken by Walter Muñoz Céspedes, who was also their candidate in the presidential election, where he finished fourth with 1.4%. However, the party lost its seat in the 2002 elections in which it received 1.7% of the vote. In the presidential election that year Muñoz finished sixth with just 0.4%. In the 2010 elections the party received only 0.8% of the vote and remained without parliamentary representation, whilst Muñoz won just 0.17% of the vote in the presidential elections. In that election, the party's vice-presidential candidate was the historic leftist leader and professor Álvaro Montero Mejía. However, two weeks before the election, the party stopped its campaign and endorsed Otton Solís, from Citizens' Action Party, in an effort to build a progressive alliance against Laura Chinchilla, candidate of the National Liberation Party. For the 2014 election Muñoz was, again, both presidential and legislative candidate gaining around 3000 votes (0.21%), the least voted candidate in that election. In 2016 Costa Rican municipal elections, the party won the syndic of the district of Santa Cruz for its candidate Arcadio Carrera. In 2020 Costa Rican municipal elections, Carrera is running for Mayor of Santa Cruz. Incumbent Vicemayor of Golfito, Hannia Herra, elected originally by the National Liberation Party in 2016 election, joined the party and is also presenting her candidacy for Mayor of Golfito for the 2020 process. Carrera and Herra's platforms are mainly seen as progressive and even leftist, opposing domination of beach areas by big resorts in their respective cantons.\n\nAccording to Muñoz the party opposes taxes, immigration, same-sex marriage and same-sex civil unions, and it also supports public monopoly of fuel distribution. Party supports state control of price for medicines, which are unregulated in Costa Rica. It also has opposed reduction on public healthcare budget for combatting cancer disease. A party's congresswoman, Patricia Villegas, has been specially known for her efforts on modernizing national law on HIV disease, in order to promote human rights of HIV positive people.\n"}

Lennon Telescope and its Thomas J. Bannan Astrophysics Facility, known together as the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT), is a Gregorian telescope observing in the optical and infrared situated on Mount Graham in southeast Arizona, United States. It achieved its first light in 1993.\n\nVATT is part of the Mount Graham International Observatory and is operated by the Vatican Observatory, one of the oldest astronomical research institutions in the world, in partnership with The University of Arizona.\n\nThe heart of the telescope is an f/1.0 honeycombed construction, borosilicate primary mirror. The VATT's mirror is unusually 'fast' at f/1, which means that its focal distance is equal to its diameter. Because it has such a short focal length, a Gregorian design could be employed which uses a concave secondary mirror at a point beyond the primary focus; this allows unusually sharp focusing across the field of view.\n\nThe unusual optical design and novel mirror fabrication techniques mean that both the primary and secondary mirrors are among the most exact surfaces ever made for a ground-based telescope. In addition, the skies above Mount Graham are among the most clear, steady, and dark in the continental North America. Seeing of better than one arc-second even without adaptive optics can be achieved on a regular basis.\n\nThe primary mirror was manufactured at The University of Arizona's Steward Observatory Mirror Laboratory, which pioneered both the spin-casting and the stressed-lap polishing techniques which are being used for telescope mirrors that include the 6.5 meter aperture MMT and Magellan telescopes, and the two 8.4 meter mirrors of the Large Binocular Telescope.\n\nGiven its excellent optical qualities, the telescope has been used primarily for imaging and photometric work, in which it regularly outperforms much larger telescopes located elsewhere. Among the results from this telescope have been the discovery of MACHOs in the Andromeda Galaxy; the validation of the Stromvil photometric filter system; evidence for how the shape and dimensions of galaxies have changed over the age of the universe; discovery of the first binary 'Vesta chip' asteroid; and the characterization and classification by visible colors of some 100 trans-Neptunian objects, most of them fainter than magnitude 21.\n\nThe government of the Vatican City State supports the Vatican Observatory staff and regular research costs, but the cost to build and maintain the VATT itself has come from private donors: the major donors supporting the construction of the VATT were Fred and Alice P. Lennon and Thomas J. Bannan. Benefactors to the Vatican Observatory Foundation continue to support the operating costs of the VATT.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2234123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2234123", "title": "Rail freight transport", "text": "Rail freight transport\n\nRail freight transport is the use of railroads and trains to transport cargo as opposed to human passengers.\n\nA freight train, cargo train, or goods train is a group of freight cars (US) or goods wagons (International Union of Railways) hauled by one or more locomotives on a railway, transporting cargo all or some of the way between the shipper and the intended destination as part of the logistics chain. Trains may haul bulk material, intermodal containers, general freight or specialized freight in purpose-designed cars. Rail freight practices and economics vary by country and region.\n\nWhen considered in terms of ton-miles or tonne-kilometers hauled per unit of energy consumed, rail transport can be more efficient than other means of transportation. Maximum economies are typically realized with bulk commodities (e.g., coal), especially when hauled over long distances. However, shipment by rail is not as flexible as by the highway, which has resulted in much freight being hauled by truck, even over long distances. Moving goods by rail often involves transshipment costs, particularly when the shipper or receiver lack direct rail access. These costs may exceed that of operating the train itself, a factor that practices such as containerization aim to minimize.\n\nTraditionally, large shippers build factories and warehouses near rail lines and have a section of track on their property called a \"siding\" where goods are loaded onto or unloaded from rail cars. Other shippers have their goods hauled (drayed) by wagon or truck to or from a goods station (freight station in US). Smaller locomotives transfer the rail cars from the sidings and goods stations to a classification yard, where each car is coupled to one of several long-distance trains being assembled there, depending on that car's destination. When long enough, or based on a schedule, each long-distance train is then dispatched to another classification yard. At the next classification yard, cars are resorted. Those that are destined for stations served by that yard are assigned to local trains for delivery. Others are reassembled into trains heading to classification yards closer to their final destination. A single car might be reclassified or \"switched\" in several yards before reaching its final destination, a process that made rail freight slow and increased costs. Many freight rail operators are trying to reduce these costs by reducing or eliminating switching in classification yards through techniques such as unit trains and containerization. In many countries, railroads have been built to haul one commodity, such as coal or ore, from an inland point to a port.\n\nRail freight uses many types of goods wagon (UIC) or freight car (US). These include box cars (US) or covered wagons (UIC) for general merchandise, flat cars (US) or flat wagons (UIC) for heavy or bulky loads, well wagons or \"low loader\" wagons for transporting road vehicles; there are refrigerator vans for transporting food, simple types of open-topped wagons for transporting bulk material, such as minerals and coal, and tankers for transporting liquids and gases. Most coal and aggregates are moved in hopper wagons or gondolas (US) or open wagons (UIC) that can be filled and discharged rapidly, to enable efficient handling of the materials.\n\nA major disadvantage of rail freight is its lack of flexibility. In part for this reason, rail has lost much of the freight business to road transport. Many governments are now trying to encourage more freight onto trains, because of the environmental benefits that it would bring; rail transport is very energy efficient. Compared to road transport whісh employs the uѕе of trucks, rail transportation ensures that goods that соuld оtherwіѕе be transported on а number of trucks are transported in а single shipment. Thіѕ saves а lot аѕ fаr аѕ cost connected to the transportation are concerned.\n\nIn Europe (particularly Britain), many manufacturing towns developed before the railway. Many factories did not have direct rail access. This meant that freight had to be shipped through a goods station, sent by train and unloaded at another goods station for onward delivery to another factory. When lorries (trucks) replaced horses it was often economical and faster to make one movement by road. In the United States, particularly in the West and Mid-West towns developed with railway and factories often had a direct rail connection. Despite the closure of many minor lines carload shipping from one company to another by rail remains common.\n\nRailroads were early users of automatic data processing equipment, starting at the turn of the twentieth century with punched cards and unit record equipment. Many rail systems have turned to computerized scheduling and optimization for trains which has reduced costs and helped add more train traffic to the rails.\n\nFreight railroads relationship with other modes of transportation varies widely. There is almost no interaction with airfreight, close cooperation with ocean-going freight and a mostly competitive relationship with long distance trucking and barge transport. Many businesses ship their products by rail if they are shipped long distance because it can be cheaper to ship in large quantities by rail than by truck; however barge shipping remains a viable competitor where water transport is available.\n\nFreight trains are sometimes illegally boarded by individuals who do not have the money or the desire to travel legally, a practice referred to as \"hopping\". Most hoppers sneak into train yards and stow away in boxcars. Bolder hoppers will catch a train \"on the fly\", that is, as it is moving, leading to occasional fatalities, some of which go unrecorded. The act of leaving a town or area, by hopping a freight train is sometimes referred to as \"catching-out\", as in catching a train out of town.\n\nBulk cargo constitutes the majority of tonnage carried by most freight railroads. Bulk cargo is commodity cargo that is transported unpackaged in large quantities. These cargo are usually dropped or poured, with a spout or shovel bucket, as a liquid or solid, into a railroad car. Liquids, such as petroleum and chemicals, and compressed gases are carried by rail in tank cars.\n\nThe heaviest trains in the world carry bulk traffic such as iron ore and coal. Loads can be 130 tonnes per wagon and tens of thousands of tonnes per train. Daqin Railway transports more than 1 million tonnes of coal to the east sea shore of China every day and in 2009 is the busiest freight line in the world Such economies of scale drive down operating costs. Some freight trains can be over 7 km long.\n\nContainerization is a system of intermodal freight transport using standard shipping containers (also known as 'ISO containers' or 'isotainers') that can be loaded with cargo, sealed and placed onto container ships, railroad cars, and trucks. Containerization has revolutionized cargo shipping. approximately 90% of non-bulk cargo worldwide is moved by containers stacked on transport ships; 26% of all container transshipment is carried out in China. , some 18 million total containers make over 200 million trips per year.\n\nUse of the same basic sizes of containers across the globe has lessened the problems caused by incompatible rail gauge sizes in different countries by making transshipment between different gauge trains easier.\n\nWhile typically containers travel for many hundreds or even thousands kilometers on the railway, Swiss experience shows that with properly coordinated logistics, it is possible to operate a viable intermodal (truck + rail) cargo transportation system even within a country as small as Switzerland.\n\nMost flatcars (flat wagons) cannot carry more than one standard container on top of another because of limited vertical clearance, even though they usually can carry the weight of two. Carrying half the possible weight is inefficient. However, if the rail line has been built with sufficient vertical clearance, a double-stack car can accept a container and still leave enough clearance for another container on top. This usually precludes operation of double-stacked wagons on lines with overhead electric wiring. China runs double-stack trains with overhead wiring, but does not allow two maximum height containers to be stacked.\n\nIn the United States, Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) with Malcom McLean came up with the idea of the first double-stack intermodal car in 1977. SP then designed the first car with ACF Industries that same year. At first it was slow to become an industry standard, then in 1984 American President Lines started working with the SP and that same year, the first all \"double stack\" train left Los Angeles, California for South Kearny, New Jersey, under the name of \"Stacktrain\" rail service. Along the way the train transferred from the SP to Conrail. It saved shippers money and now accounts for almost 70 percent of intermodal freight transport shipments in the United States, in part due to the generous vertical clearances used by U.S. railroads. These lines are diesel operated with no overhead wiring.\n\nDouble stacking is also used in Australia between Adelaide, Parkes, Perth and Darwin. These are diesel only lines with no overhead wiring. Saudi Arabian Railways use double-stack in its Riyadh-Damman corridor. Double stacking is used in India for selected freight-only lines.\n\nIn some countries rolling highway, or rolling road, trains are used; trucks can drive straight onto the train and drive off again when the end destination is reached. A system like this is used on the Channel Tunnel between the United Kingdom and France, as well as on the Konkan Railway in India. In other countries, the tractor unit of each truck is not carried on the train, only the trailer. \"Piggy back\" trains are common in the United States, where they are also known as \"trailer on flat car\" or TOFC trains, but they have lost market share to containers (COFC), with longer, 53-foot containers frequently used for domestic shipments. There are also roadrailer vehicles, which have two sets of wheels, for use in a train, or as the trailer of a road vehicle.\n\nSeveral types of cargo are not suited for containerization or bulk; these are transported in special cars custom designed for the cargo.\n\nLess-than-carload freight is any load that does not fill a boxcar or box motor or less than a Boxcar load\n\nHistorically in North America, trains might be classified as either way freight or through freight. A way freight generally carried less-than-carload shipments to/from a location, whose origin/destination was a rail terminal yard. This product sometimes arrived at/departed from that yard by means of a through freight. \n\nAt a minimum, a way freight comprised a locomotive and caboose, to which cars called pickups and setouts were added or dropped off along the route. For convenience, smaller consignments might be carried in the caboose, which prompted some railroads to define their cabooses as way cars, although the term equally applied to boxcars used for that purpose. Way stops might be industrial sidings, stations/flag stops, settlements, or even individual residences. \n\nWith the difficulty of maintaining an exact schedule, way freights yielded to scheduled passenger and through trains. They were often mixed trains that served isolated communities. Like passenger service generally, way freights and their smaller consignments became uneconomical. In North America, the latter ceased, and the public sector took over passenger transportation. Good roads and trucking have replaced way freights in most parts of the world.\n\nRailroads are subject to the network effect: the more points they connect to, the greater the value of the system as a whole. Early railroads were built to bring resources, such as coal, ores and agricultural products from inland locations to ports for export. In many parts of the world, particularly the southern hemisphere, that is still the main use of freight railroads. Greater connectivity opens the rail network to other freight uses including non-export traffic. Rail network connectivity is limited by a number of factors, including geographical barriers, such as oceans and mountains, technical incompatibilities, particularly different track gauges and railway couplers, and political conflicts. The largest rail networks are located in North America and Eurasia. Long distance freight trains are generally longer than passenger trains, with greater length improving efficiency. Maximum length varies widely by system.\"See\" longest trains for train lengths in different countries.\n\nGenerally trucking moves the most tonnage of all traffic in most large economies. Many countries are moving to increase speed and volume of rail freight in an attempt to win markets over or to relieve overburdened roads and/or speed up shipping in the age of online shopping. In Japan, trends towards adding rail freight shipping are more due to availability of workers rather than other concerns.\nRail freight tonnage as a percent of total moved by country:\n\nThere are four major interconnecting rail networks on the Eurasian land mass, along with other smaller national networks.\n\nMost countries in the European Union participate in an auto-gauge network. The United Kingdom is linked to this network via the Channel Tunnel. The Marmaray project connects Europe with eastern Turkey, Iran, and the Middle East via a rail tunnel under the Bosphorus. The 57-km Gotthard Base Tunnel improved north–south rail connections when it opened in 2016. Spain and Portugal are mostly broad gauge, though Spain has built some standard gauge lines that connect with the European high-speed passenger network. A variety of electrification and signaling systems is in use, though this is less of an issue for freight; however, overhead electrification prevents double-stack service on most lines. Buffer-and-screw couplings are generally used between freight vehicles, although there are plans to develop an automatic coupler compatible with the Russian SA3. \"See\" Railway coupling conversion.\n\nThe countries of the former Soviet Union, along with Finland and Mongolia, participate in a Russian gauge-compatible network, using SA3 couplers. Major lines are electrified. Russia's Trans-Siberian Railroad connects Europe with Asia, but does not have the clearances needed to carry double-stack containers. Numerous connections are available between Russian-gauge countries with their standard-gauge neighbors in the west (throughout Europe) and south (to China, North Korea, and Iran via Turkmenistan). While the USSR had important railway connections to Turkey (from Armenia) and to Iran (from Azerbaijan's Nakhchivan enclave), these have been out of service since the early 1990s, since a number of frozen conflicts in the Caucasus region have forced the closing of the rail connections between Russia and Georgia via Abkhazia, between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and between Armenia and Turkey.\n\nChina has an extensive standard-gauge network. Its freight trains use Janney couplers. China's railways connect with the standard-gauge network of North Korea in the east, with the Russian-gauge network of Russia, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan in the north, and with the meter-gauge network of Vietnam in the south.\n\nIndia and Pakistan operate entirely on broad gauge networks. Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts currently restrict rail traffic between the two countries to two passenger lines. There are also links from India to Bangladesh and Nepal, and from Pakistan to Iran, where a new, but little-used, connection to the standard-gauge network is available at Zahedan.\n\nThe four major Eurasian networks link to neighboring countries and to each other at several break of gauge points. Containerization has facilitated greater movement between networks, including a Eurasian Land Bridge.\n\nCanada, Mexico and the United States are connected by an extensive, unified standard gauge rail network. The one notable exception is the isolated Alaska Railroad, which is connected to the main network by rail barge.\n\nRail freight is well standardized in North America, with Janney couplers and compatible air brakes. The main variations are in loading gauge and maximum car weight. Most trackage is owned by private companies that also operate freight trains on those tracks. Since the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, the freight rail industry in the U.S. has been largely deregulated. Freight cars are routinely interchanged between carriers, as needed, and are identified by company reporting marks and serial numbers. Most have computer readable automatic equipment identification transponders. With isolated exceptions, freight trains in North America are hauled by diesel locomotives, even on the electrified Northeast Corridor.\n\nOngoing freight-oriented development includes upgrading more lines to carry heavier and taller loads, particularly for double-stack service, and building more efficient intermodal terminals and transload facilities for bulk cargo. Many railroads interchange in Chicago, and a number of improvements are underway or proposed to eliminate bottlenecks there. The U.S. Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 mandates eventual conversion to Positive Train Control signaling. In the 2010s, most North American Class I railroads have adopted some form of precision railroading.\n\nThe Guatemala railroad is currently inactive, preventing rail shipment south of Mexico. Panama has freight rail service, recently converted to standard gauge, that parallels the Panama Canal. A few other rail systems in Central America are still in operation, but most have closed. There has never been a rail line through Central America to South America.\n\nBrazil has a large rail network, mostly metre gauge, with some broad gauge. It runs some of the heaviest iron ore trains in the world on its metre gauge network.\nArgentina have Indian gauge networks in the south and metre gauge networks in the north. The metre gauge networks are connected at one point, but there has never been a broad gauge connection. (A metre-gauge connection between the two broad gauge networks, the Transandine Railway was constructed but is not currently in service. \"See also Trans-Andean railways.\") Most other countries have few rail systems.\n\nThe railways of Africa were mostly started by colonial powers to bring inland resources to port. There was little regard for eventual interconnection. As a result, there are a variety of gauge and coupler standards in use. A gauge network with Janney couplers serves southern Africa. East Africa uses metre gauge. North Africa uses standard gauge, but potential connection to the European standard gauge network is blocked by the Arab–Israeli conflict.\n\nRail developed independently in different parts of Australia and, as a result, three major rail gauges are in use. A standard gauge Trans-Australian Railway spans the continent.\n\nIn 2011, North American railroads operated 1,471,736 freight cars and 31,875 locomotives, with 215,985 employees, They originated 39.53 million carloads (averaging 63 tons each) and generated $81.7 billion in freight revenue. The largest (Class 1) U.S. railroads carried 10.17 million intermodal containers and 1.72 million trailers. Intermodal traffic was 6.2% of tonnage originated and 12.6% of revenue. The largest commodities were coal, chemicals, farm products, nonmetallic minerals and intermodal. Coal alone was 43.3% of tonnage and 24.7% of revenue. The average haul was 917 miles. Within the U.S. railroads carry 39.9% of freight by ton-mile, followed by trucks (33.4%), oil pipelines (14.3%), barges (12%) and air (0.3%).\n\nRailways carried 17.1% of EU freight in terms of tonne-km, compared to road transport (76.4%) and inland waterways (6.5%).\n\n\nUnlike passenger trains, freight trains are rarely named.\n\nBecause freight trains are designed to transport inanimate goods, stowing away on a freight train is a highly dangerous activity. Nonetheless, it is one of the only means of long-distance travel for transients and impoverished people. Unauthorized travel on freight trains thus peaks during times of economic distress, such as the Great Depression. \n"}

The club are members of the and play at New Bucks Park.\n\nThe original Bootle F.C. were formed in 1879 and played their first fixture in 1880 on Hawthorne Road, adjacent to Bootle Cricket Club. The club were Everton F.C.'s main rivals and competed with Everton for the prestigious place in the newly formed Football League. Because only one club per area were permitted to join, Bootle narrowly lost out, despite the fact that in the run up to the decision Everton were banned from the both the FA Cup and the Liverpool Senior Cup the previous year. However Bootle lost out and in 1889–90 Bootle became founder members of the Football Alliance, which became the newly formed Football League Second Division. That season was the most successful as the club finished league runners-up and reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, losing to Blackburn Rovers. When the Alliance merged with the Football League in 1892, Bootle became founder members of the new Second Division. However, despite finishing in a respectable 8th place, the club dropped out after one season due to ongoing financial problems. Ironically a new local club, Liverpool, took Bootle's place in the second division.\n\nThe possible resurrection of a Bootle team became a distinct probability in August 1947 when local councillors identified the popularity and talent on show in the ‘Bootle JOC’ league and knew the town was big enough to be put back on the football map with its own team again. For years it had been an exporter of its many players to other clubs, both professional and semi-professional. The promise of sponsorship money from local businesses brought great optimism and the issue of one shilling shares further boosted club finances. After local residents were assured that the ground at Bootle Stadium (Maguire Avenue) would not be used solely as a football ground, an application to join the Lancashire Combination for the 1948/49 season was made, and accepted. Club colours even posed a problem; red or blue were dismissed for fear of showing favour to either of the ‘big two’ so it was agreed that, as the original Bootle FC wore white shorts, this colour would be adopted. Players mostly came from the local league and surrounding clubs, however one player that Bootle overlooked was a tall, blonde, ex-prisoner-of-war German, Bert Trautmann. Trautman, then living in Huyton, trained with Bootle at the stadium for several weeks but, with the area taking such a heavy pounding during the war, it was decided not to tempt any local bitterness and he was allowed to join St Helens Town and of course moved on to FA Cup and Manchester City folklore.\nThey kicked off their new campaign in 1948 against Barnoldswick and district. The league was won at the first attempt. However, Bootle struggled in the top-flight and after several tough seasons and also a change in Council priorities they withdrew from the league and folded during the 1953–54 campaign.\n\nIn 1953, the current club was formed as Langton with Frank Doran Senior and Ben Dunning being one of the founding members. The club played in the various local Bootle leagues. After a successful spell in the Liverpool County Combination, winning multiple leagues and cups, the club requested to change its name to the latest incarnation of Bootle FC. This was accepted in 1973 and a year later ‘the Bucks’ joined the Lancashire Combination.\n\nAfter winning the Combination in both 1976 and 1977, Bootle then joined the Second Division of the Cheshire County League, which was won in the first season, and were promoted to the First Division. In 1982 the Cheshire County League was one of the leagues that merged to form the North West Counties League, which Bootle duly joined, becoming a member of the First Division (Which is now called the Premier Division). The club spent most of their time in the First Division until 2000 when the club was relegated to the Second Division.\n\nHowever, despite finishing 6th in 2002, the club dropped into the Liverpool County Combination as Bucks Park on Copy Lane closed its doors for the final time. \nIn 2006 the club, with a new ground on Vesty Road, were elected back into Division 2 of the North West Counties League. In 2009 Bootle won promotion to the NWCFL Premier Division and also won the Championship. In 2009/10, the first season back in the NWCFL Premier Division Bootle finished a NWCFL high for the first time reaching 3rd place. In 2010/11 finished 6th place. They equalled the 3rd place again in 2012. More success followed in 2013 when the club lifted the Liverpool Senior Cup.\n\nIn 2017 Bootle finished runners-up for the first time in the NWCFL Premier Division, losing out to Atherton Collieries for the title.\n\nIn 2019 the Bucks agonisingly missed out on the title yet again, finishing runner-up after a 20 match winning streak was halted by a final day draw at home to Northwich Victoria saw City of Liverpool claim the league.\n\nSince 1953 Frank Doran Senior has been the mainstay of this era for Bootle FC. Being a player, manager, secretary, grounds man, and now president of the club.

He was the founding leader of the Sikkim Sangram Parishad party. He was popularly remembered for his efforts to include the Nepali language in 8th Schedule of the Constitution of India. He was the first Indian chief minister of Gorkha origin. He also served as the president of Bharatia Nepali Bhasha Parisangh until his death. He is popularly known as the architect of modern Sikkim.\n\nNar Bahadur Bhandari was born on 5 October 1940 in Malbasay village, near Soreng, West Sikkim. He earned his BA degree from Darjeeling Government College and worked as a school teacher for some years before entering politics. His wife, Dil Kumari Bhandari, is a former member of parliament (Lok Sabha) from Sikkim.\n\nBhandari founded the Sikkim Janata Parishad in 1977. This party won the state assembly election in 1979, and he became the chief minister for the first time on 18 October 1979. In 1984, he also served briefly as member of parliament from the Sikkim constituency in the 8th Lok Sabha as an independent candidate. In 1984, Bhandari dissolved Sikkim Janata Parishad and formed a new party called Sikkim Sangram Parishad (SSP). This party ran in the assembly elections in 1985 and won, and Bhandari became the chief minister for the second time. In 1989, SSP returned to power by winning the assembly elections. In a rare instance in Indian national politics, the SSP became the singular party in the Sikkim Legislative Assembly, winning all 32 seats in the house. In 1994, Bhandari lost a vote of confidence in the state assembly, and he resigned as chief minister. Later, he served as a member of the legislative assembly from 1994 to 2004.\n\nIn 1994, SSP lost the assembly elections to the Sikkim Democratic Front led by Pawan Kumar Chamling. SSP also lost the 1999 assembly election. In the 2004 state assembly elections, Bhandari ran under the Congress party, but the party lost the election, winning only one seat in the assembly. In May 2007, he was sentenced to prison for one month in a corruption case. Again in the 2009 assembly elections, the Congress party under Bhandari failed to win any seat in the state assembly. \nIn the 2014 election, his party unanimously supported a new political party SKM under the leadership of PS Golay. Bhandari, despite his conviction in a corruption case continued campaigning for SKM which managed to win only 10 seats out of 32. Prior to his death, he was closely involved with the SKM party; he gave his last speech at the SKM Foundation Day Celebration in Singtam on 4 February 2017.\n\nHis notable political accomplishments are free education from elementary to graduate school, establishing nearby schools-- within a radius of 3 to 4 km-- for all residents, providing drinking water to every household in Sikkim, building a network of roads to all major villages in Sikkim, bringing all rural areas onto the electric grid, and the setup of vast healthcare centers.\n\nBhandari became the president of the Sikkim Pradesh Congress Committee (SPCC) after he had merged SSP with the Indian National Congress in 2003. In May 2013, he was reinstated as the president of SSP. In 2014, he was convicted in a CBI corruption case.\n\nBhandari died on 16 July 2017 following spinal surgery.\n\nHis final rites were performed with full state honour by the current chief minister, Pawan Kumar Chamling, including a 21-gun salute. In a very rare gesture, the family of the former king of Sikkim sent their royal flag to be wrapped around Bhandari during the state funeral.\n"}

He was educated at the Saint-Cyr and entered the army in 1828.\n\nIn 1851 he had risen to the rank of colonel, and Napoleon III, with whom he was a favorite, made him general of brigade in 1854 and general of division in 1855, after which Failly was for a time his \"aide-de-camp\". During the Crimean War he served in the siege of Sevastopol. During the Austro-Sardinian War he commanded the 3rd Infantry Division in the 4th Corps. In 1867 he led the French expeditionary corps sent to protect the Papal States with which he defeated Giuseppe Garibaldi at Mentana, this action being the first in which the chassepot rifle was used. Back in France, he was made a senator for life.\n\nIn 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, Failly commanded the 5th Corps. His inactivity at Bitche on 6 August while the 1st Corps on his right and the 2nd Corps on his left were crushed at the battles of Wörth and Spicheren respectively, gave rise to the greatest indignation in France. Failly then commanded the right wing of Marshal de Mac-Mahon's \"Army of Châlons\" during the Sedan campaign, and the disastrous outcome of that campaign is partly ascribed to Failly's tactics, though he is certainly no more to blame than the other French generals. Failly and his 5th Corps were routed at Beaumont on 30 August 1870 by two corps led by George of Saxony. In this battle the French were surprised in their cantonments and driven back upon Mouzon. The defeat closed the southern escape route and forced the French \"Army of Châlons\" towards the Belgian frontier and encirclement at Sedan. He was captured by the Prussians at Sedan on 2 September, but was liberated some months later.\n\nThe rest of his life was spent in retirement. He died at Compiègne, aged 82.\n\nFailly wrote \"Campagne de 1870. Opérations et marches du 5ème corps jusqu'au 31 août\" (Brussels, 1871).\n"}

Productions were often out of doors, sometimes ticketed, sometimes freely viewable in public spaces. Redmoon also produced shows in traditional venues, and is involved in community projects in Chicago. It is now defunct.\n\nRedmoon Theater was founded in 1990 by puppeteer Blair Thomas and choreographer Lauri Macklin, combining movement theater with puppetry. In 1992, Macklin left and Thomas continued on his own until Jim Lasko joined Thomas's commitment to outdoor performance. During this period the team garnered critical praise for their inventive indoor theater productions of classic stories like Moby-Dick and Frankenstein, while beginning to explore how the same theatrical skills could activate outdoor spaces. Mr. Thomas left the theater in 1998, leaving it to Mr. Lasko to continue to build an aesthetic and operation around his vision of using spectacle to bridge difference and transform the ways that people see and understand public spaces. During this period, Redmoon committed to transforming streets, stages, and architectural landmarks with a performance style equal parts pageantry, gadgetry, puppetry, robust physical performance and visual art. In 2009, Mr. Lasko accepted a one-year appointment to become the Artist in Residence for the City of Chicago, and, after 13 years of working as an artist and community leader with the organization, Frank Maugeri assumed the role of Artistic Director. A year later, the duo joined forces to co-lead Redmoon. \n\nNOTE: 12/27/2015—It is with great regret that the leadership of Redmoon informs you that we are closing our doors forever.\n\nSee Redmoon: Production History for further details.\n\nFor eight years (1995–2002), Redmoon produced \"All Hallows' Eve,\" a ritual performance during Halloween in Chicago's Logan Square neighborhood that in its final year brought together an audience of over 10,000 in a single evening.\n\n\"All Hallows' Eve\" was followed by a trilogy of outdoor performances located in neighborhoods throughout Chicago from 2004–2006. These were:\n\nIn 2007, Redmoon created a large-scale commissioned work for the newly created festival Looptopia, a celebration of culture in downtown Chicago, which featured site installations throughout the Loop with a procession down Washington Street culminating in a performance in Daley Plaza for more than 20,000 spectators.\n\nIn 2010, co-produced by Redmoon Theater and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, \"The Astronaut's Birthday,\" a production reminiscent of a graphic novel, was projected onto the west façade of the MCA as audience members watched from the plaza.\n\nRecognized as a Special Events Producer, Redmoon has contributed to such projects as The Millennium Park Opening Ceremony, Art Institute Ground Breaking, the City of Chicago’s Looptopia Festival, and the 2009 Halloween celebrations before the First family, their staff and guests at the White House in Washington, DC.\n\nThe company has created theatre productions, community projects and large-scale, site-specific performances, that have been experienced across Chicago from Belmont Harbor and the Jackson Park Lagoon to the façade of the Museum of Contemporary Art. Redmoon has also worked in traditional theatre venues from the stage of Harris Theater to Steppenwolf. In addition, the company has produced international projects in the Netherlands, Ireland, France, and Australia.\n\nRedmoon has also established an international reputation with artists recently traveling to the Netherlands and Australia creating large-scale outdoor, site-specific public events in addition to this season’s production of \"Once Upon a Time\" traveling to the International Puppetry Festival in France; while continuing its community focused arts education programming to children and teachers in Ireland.\n\nWith this unique visual language, Redmoon Theater aspires to transform streets and stages into places of public celebration, capable of speaking across cultural, ethnic, and generational boundaries that focuses on contributing to civic well-being and social exchange.\n\nHighly influenced by contemporary art works and ancient theatrical forms, Redmoon Theater has created a performance style that is equal parts pageantry, gadgetry, acrobatics, and ephemera.\n\nThe company has been hailed by the Chicago Tribune as “impossibly inventive” and “full of visual wit,” and described by the Chicago Sun-Times as “one of the only theaters that can keep a 2-year-old and a 50-year-old equally enchanted and filled with wide-eyed wonder.” Working outdoors in public spaces as well as in both established theaters and non-traditional venues, Redmoon blends elements of ritual and symbol, spectacular physical performance and live music with exquisitely crafted objects and machines, producing works of stunning originality that are capable of delighting non-traditional audiences and conventional theater-goers alike.\n\nSince the first Winter Pageant in 1991, Redmoon has received public and critical acclaim for its spectacle productions that tap into the collective memory and imagination of audiences. Through its productions and events Redmoon brings audiences together for transformative experiences.\n\nThrough spellbinding original productions and a unique voice that speaks across cultural boundaries, Redmoon draws in Chicagoans like no other theater company. It has gained a national reputation for both its one-of-a-kind visual style and its civic-focused ability to build community through creating unexpected theater events in unexpected places.\n\nRedmoon’s mission extends far beyond its production work, as neighborhood children and community members have been integrated into the artistic process since the company’s early beginnings in Logan Square. Through Neighborhood Arts Programs, Redmoon provides in-depth, art-making experiences to Chicago’s underserved populations via two distinct programs: the Redmoon School Partnership Program, which creates meaningful and effective learning opportunities for students and teachers by integrating spectacle theater into the classroom and the school community; and Dramagirls, which teaches adolescent girls to express themselves through performance and theater-making, enhancing their self-esteem at a critical time in their lives.\n\nIt also offers independent classes and workshops in mask making and civic programs for the community, including Dramagirls and the highly successful, nationally recognized Neighborhood Arts Program led by NAP director, Angela Tillges.\n\nRedmoon has always been led by visionary Artistic Director(s) who emphasized a collaborative process of art making. The work is multi-disciplinary and generally includes artists from many fields. Designers, engineers, architects, dancers, acrobats, painters, composers and musicians, videographers, graphic artists, and others make up the collaborative team that create Redmoon's distinct brand of theater.\n\nRedmoon was founded in the Logan Square neighborhood of Chicago by the performance artist Blair Thomas and choreographer Laurie Macklin. Macklin was soon to leave and Jim Lasko, a theater maker and director, came to join Mr. Thomas. Mr. Lasko become the company's Founding Artistic Director, working alongside Blair Thomas until he left to found Blair Thomas & Company which is committed to \"chamber puppet theater\". In May, 2009 Mr. Lasko was named Artist in Residence to the City of Chicago's Office of Tourism, Department of Cultural Affairs and he took leave of Redmoon for a two-year period during which Mr. Maugeri acted as Artistic Director. As of January 2011, Mr. Lasko has returned from his stint with The City of Chicago to co-lead Redmoon with Mr. Maugeri.\n\nRedmoon is operated by a 36-member board of directors and is funded through various avenues including ticket sales and a business arm called Redmoon-For-Hire run by Director of Redmoon For Hire, Alex Balestrieri, which provides customized party entertainment for corporate events, conventions and private client parties. Corporate funding and grant/foundation contributions also provides the not-for-profit with financial assistance. As a result, Redmoon surpassed $1 million in revenue for the first time in 2002.\n\n\n"}

It is an extension of using shared memory to reduce the total amount of memory required.\n\nIts general effect is that the program text consumes no writable memory, saving it for dynamic data, and that all instances of the program are run from a single copy.\n\nFor this to work, several criteria have to be met:\n\nThe storage requirements are usually met by using NOR flash memory, which can be addressed as individual words for read operations, although it is a bit slower than normal system RAM in most setups.\n\nTypically, the first stage boot loader is an XIP program that is linked to run at the address at which the flash chip(s) are mapped at power-up and contains a minimal program to set up the system RAM (which depends on the components used on the individual boards and cannot be generalized enough so that the proper sequence could be embedded into the processor hardware) and then loads the second stage bootloader or the OS kernel into RAM.\n\nDuring this initialization, writable memory may not be available, so all computations have to be performed within the processor registers. For this reason, first stage boot loaders tend to be written in assembler language and only do the minimum to provide a normal execution environment for the next program. Some processors either embed a small amount of SRAM in the chip itself, or allow using the onboard cache memory as RAM, to make this first stage boot loader easier to write using high-level language.\n\nFor a kernel or bootloader, address space generally is assigned internally, so in order to use XIP for them, it is sufficient to instruct the linker to place unmodifiable and modifiable data in different address ranges and provide a mechanism for the modifiable data to be copied to writable memory before any code is run that assumes that data can be accessed normally. This can be done as part of the previous stage, or within a small code segment at the beginning of the program.\n\nIf address space is assigned externally, such as in an application program that is run on a system that does not provide virtual memory, the compiler needs to access all modifiable data by adding an offset to a pointer to a private copy of the data area. In this case, the external loader is responsible for setting up the instance specific memory areas.\n\nXIP places requirements on file systems that are often difficult to meet. In systems without a page table, the entire file must be stored within consecutive bytes and must not be fragmented, while flash based file systems often aim to distribute data into sectors of the flash chip that have the least erase cycles and even out the wear on the chip, prolonging its lifetime.\n\nAll these complications and the speed tradeoff mean that XIP is generally only used for first stage bootloaders or when RAM is in extremely short supply. In particular, second through fourth generation video game consoles connect the ROM cartridge's address and data bus to that of the console, which lets (for example) the Atari 2600 work with only the 128 bytes of RAM in its joystick interface IC.\n\nA relatively new file system for Linux, called AXFS (\"Advanced XIP File System\"), aims to overcome some of the shortcomings associated with XIP, especially in regard to the in-place execution of user-space applications. It makes for instance possible to split up an executable binary file into \"XIP regions\", thus avoiding the restriction of fragmentation that was mentioned above.\n\nA NetBSD implementation is also under development.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2234153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2234153", "title": "Hazlet, Saskatchewan", "text": "Hazlet, Saskatchewan\n\nHazlet is a small farming village within the Rural Municipality of Pittville No. 169, in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. The village is located north west of the city of Swift Current near the Great Sand Hills. The village had a population of 106 in the 2016 Canada Census, (an 11.6% increase from 95 in the 2011 Canada Census).\n\nIn the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Village of Hazlet recorded a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.\n\nIn the 2011 Census of Population, the Village of Hazlet recorded a population of , a change from its 2006 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011.\n\nHazlet was incorporated a village in 1928 after the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Hazlet is a thriving farming community, full of activity and friendly community support. Hazlet offers a safe and comfortable lifestyle. Hazlet’s Economy is driven mostly by agriculture, raising cattle/bison, and energy including oil and natural gas. Oil and gas exploration certainly provides a substantial economic contribution to the village and surrounding area. Hazlet is very proud to have their school involved in and International School program. This is where they host students from other countries, who desire education with English instruction. This international school also contributes to the local economy.\n\nBaseball has been a part of the Hazlet and surrounding community since the 1920s. Hazlet has had great senior teams such as the Hazlet Blackhawks of the 1930s and 1940s and the Hazlet Elks of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The earliest record of an organized team is in 1935, but baseball was being played in and around Hazlet much earlier than that. In 1938 the team won 57 out of 64 games and won 9 tournaments including their own. That year 6 players had batting averages over .400. The coach, Budd Lewis did not give credit for a hit unless it was well deserved, so it stands to reason that the averages may have been even higher by today's rules. Hazlet also had great women's teams such as the Hazlet Hornets Ball team. Hazlet continued to have a women's team until the 1990s. Minor baseball has always been popular, and kids still play baseball and slo-pitch today. Without the development of these young players, Hazlet would not have been able to dominate the South River Baseball League as they did in the 1970s and early 1980s, winning several league championships. The community of Hazlet was inducted into the Saskatchewan Baseball Hall of Fame at a ceremony on August 17, 2013 in Battleford, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Hazlet Elks were a senior baseball team that played in Hazlet until 1993. From 1982 to 1993 they played in the Saskatchewan Major Baseball League. They won league championships in 1987, 1988, and 1989.\n\nThe Hazlet Elks played in the South River Baseball League until 1981. Other teams in the league included Gull Lake, Climax, Frontier, and Shaunavon. The Elks had enormous success in this league winning several championships in the 1970s. The Elks won consecutive championships in 1979, 1980, and 1981. In 1981 Hazlet beat the Unity Cardinals in tournament play, a team that had 9 American import players on the roster. It was decided that Hazlet needed to play in a more competitive league. In October 1981 the Hazlet Elks were accepted into the Saskatchewan Major Baseball League.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Major Baseball League was the highest level of collegiate summer baseball played in Saskatchewan up until the year 2000 when the name was changed to the Western Major Baseball League.Other teams included the Regina Red Sox, Moose Jaw Astros, Kindersley Royals, Saskatoon Liners, Eston Ramblers, Saskatoon Nationals, Oyen Pronghorns, and the Unity Cardinals. 1982 was the first year in the SMBL, and their first game attracted over 400 fans. The team finished last in the league that year, and it was obvious that they would have to work their way up from the bottom. The team was not discouraged because the final playoff pairings were not decided until the very last day of the schedule. In 1983 and 1984 they lost in the league final. It was in 1987 the Elks won their first league championship by defeating the Kindersley Royals. The Hazlet Elks went on to three-peat as SMBL champions by taking the league title in 1987, 1988, and 1989. The achievements of this team were notable as the population of Hazlet was around 125 people. It was truly a community effort to make the team viable. An executive of 14 members helped co-ordinate volunteer hours by themselves and others in the community. Among these were Vince Akre, Don Anderson, Terry Bailey, Bill Boss, Peter Buchanan, Donnie Knutson, Harvey McIntosh, Sandy Starkey, Barry Stock, Mark Stock, Lyle Thoreson, and Donnie Zinn. Larry English was the general manager. They were competing against cities and towns in Saskatchewan that were several times the population of Hazlet. Hazlet was the smallest town to ever compete in this league. The Hazlet Elks had seven future Major League Baseball players or draft picks on their roster including Gerald Wagner, Steve Reed, Vince Shinholster, Willie Hysaw, Greg Mathews, Kurt Mattson, and Kernan Ronan. Steve Reed had the best major league career as a pitcher, playing for several teams in his 14-year Major League Baseball career. Greg Mathews played 7 years in the majors for 2 different teams. Other future major league players that signed with the Elks but never played include Mark McGwire, Randy Johnson, and Cory Snyder. Larry English was the scout for the Elks, and also had a career as a scout for the Minnesota Twins for 5 years. Because of the small population of Hazlet, the team was allowed to have four American imports on their roster. It was partly because of these imports that Hazlet was able to remain competitive, even against larger centres in the league. Hazlet attracted fans from all over southwest Saskatchewan to see the highest level of baseball being played in the province.\n\n\nHazlet plans to join the league in 2019 or 2020 as an expansion team and is currently fundraising to bring senior baseball back to the community.\n\nThe first organization of the Hazlet Branch 202 was on February 1, 1936. Those appointed were Leslie Colter, Rudolph Stock, Frank Dyball, John H. Boyer, Arthur E. Todd, Percy Pyne, Charles W. Perry, Charles J. Herriott, William T. Vilness, Ralph S. Bingham, John Munt, Joseph F. McAdam, Walter Weedon, Edward I. Olson, and Oscar A. Sannes, with J. H. Boyer as Secretary.\nBranch 202 was re-organized in 1946, and the charter members were Frank McAdam, Leslie Colter, Owen Olsgard, Orland\nRobertson, George Bell, John McIver and W. J. Burak. The first recorded meeting was on November 5, 1946 in the McCabe grain elevator office with President Owen Olsgard, Secretary/Treasurer Frank McAdam and eight members present.\nThe first project was a dance on May 30, 1947 with net proceeds of $29.18. The attention then turned to the construction of a\nmonument to servicemen from Hazlet and area who had made the supreme sacrifice. The monument was completed in 1948 and still stands today on Railway Street in Hazlet, bearing the following names: F/O T.R. Bailey, D.F.C. Sgt. A/G M.A. Lowick, Sgt.\nAG/W.N. Partridge, Sgt. A/G D.L. Robertson and Pte. R. Shiels.\nIn 1948, the Legion formed a softball team and actively supported a ladies’ team. The Legion teams existed for several years and each year held a sports day tournament. A meeting place for the Legion was a problem, so in 1949, a clubroom was set up in the basement of the Community Hall. This was used as the meeting place until August 1950, when Maurice Akre offered the use of his poolroom. This continued as their meeting place for seven years, with free use of the pool tables included.\nThe first annual dance for the Branch was on October 26, 1951. Admission was 50 cents per person; the orchestra fee was $55.00, hall rent of $15.00, and the net profit for the evening was $4.00. Other firsts for the Branch are: first annual Legion bonspiel on March 3, 1954; first entry to the Legion Curling playoffs in 1955; first Legion carnival in 1957; first turkey bingo in 1957; and first annual Legion deep-pit barbecue in 1966. The carnivals were held annually for seven years while turkey\nbingos continued for thirteen years. The deep-pit barbecues reached twenty years annually in 1985. The barbecue in 1978,\nwhich was Hazlet’s 50th Anniversary year, had the largest attendance, catering to approximately 1100 people in one hour.\nIn 1956, they purchased the Trent School for $3.00. A concrete basement was poured on November 10, 1956, and we had the first\nmeeting on February 14, 1957, in their own Legion Hall. In 2004, the Hazlet Legion made the decision to close the Legion\nHall due to the increasing costs of maintaining it, and the limited use of the building. Meetings are now held in the local Café. In\n2005, the Hazlet Ladies’ Auxiliary joined the Legion to bring their experience and much welcomed comradeship to Hazlet Branch’s small, but proud group.\n\nThe Hazlet Lions Club has been a cornerstone of public service to Hazlet and the surrounding community for generations. The Lions club has supported numerous activities over the years including the Sandhills Relay, Youth Exchange students, dances, parades, pancake breakfasts, cabarets, curling, and other sporting events. They have sponsored numerous sports teams and youth activities in the community.\n\nThe United Catholic Anglican Lutheran Church women's group has supported events in Hazlet for generations. They have frequently supported fundraising events, teas, bake sales, trade shows, community gatherings and Bingo's.\n\nHazlet was a world pioneer in providing universal healthcare. In 1944 The Swift Current area was slated to be the demonstration unit for preventive medicine. The RM of Pittville at Hazlet already had a health scheme, devised by William J. Burak, whereby its residents received both medical and hospital care for just under $11 per person per year. Wishing to add the Pittville method of full medical care to the preventive program planned for the southwest, Burak wrote at his own expense to each municipality, town and village, visited each weekly newspaper editor, and called a public meeting to press for a full medical and hospital plan. When a vote of all ratepayers was held on November 26, 1945, a majority voted in favour of a full regional health plan.\n\nThe Saskatchewan government, manoeuvred by Burak into initiating a more comprehensive scheme than the preventive medicine program it had planned, passed an Order-in-Council on December 11. The region's hospitalization and health care scheme took effect on July 1, 1946—a full two years before Great Britain's \"cradle to the grave\" health care plan was implemented. Within the Swift Current Health Region (Saskatchewan's Health Region #1) the residents felt empowered, and the region assembled statistical data on the costs of health care that were unrivalled in Canada. The regional scheme flowered when Dr. Vince Matthews, the public health officer, provided seamless integration of preventive work and medical care, a first in Canada. There was a high level of rapport between the local administration, the constituent municipalities, patients, and physicians: Stewart Robertson, the administrator, Dr. Vince Matthews, and Dr. Cas Wolan, president of the district medical association, met informally most days for coffee. In 1951, Swift Current created the first regional hospital board in Canada.\n\nIn 2009 the community of Hazlet undertook a project to create the first wind powered recreation complex in Canada.\n\nStanding Rock is a large glacial erratic left from the last ice age around 14,000 years ago. It is composed of granite from the Hudson Bay area and is 3.35 metres high and 9.14 metres long . It is about 6 kilometres west of Hazlet. It was used as a landmark by early settlers, and as a scratching post for bison for centuries. It is a historical site today.\n\nIn the spring of 1960 a committee was formed to look into the idea of forming a regional park at the Hazlet Dam. Regional Park status was applied for and was received in the fall of 1960 making it one of the original Regional Parks in the province. In 1961 the first trees were planted followed by playground equipment, a cookhouse, benches and a golf course. Later a tennis court and electric campsites were added.\n\nThe community rink complex is one of the most used facilities in town. Home of the curling rink, skating rink, and lounge, the building is used not only in the winter, but all year round. During the winter, there is always a different curling tournament, from ladies, to mixed, to even high school tournaments and regional curling. The skating part is used everyday in the winter, as there is power skating, skating lessons, public skating, and hockey games for all ages. The lounge is the newest addition to the complex.\n\nThe community hall in Hazlet is a great size, and is used for all kinds of events. It is home to the Sandhills Players, where they use it for plays and dinner theatres. The hall is also used all year round for any events such dances, concerts, suppers, gatherings and fundraisers.\n"}

She is primarily portrayed as a powerful witch driven by her vacillating love and hatred for Barnabas Collins.\n\nIn the original TV series, the character was portrayed by Lara Parker, and appeared within several storylines of the series which aired from June 1966 through April 1971. Angelique was originally introduced to explain how Barnabas Collins became a vampire, but she proved popular enough in her own right to make many return appearances. She is portrayed by English actress Lysette Anthony in the 1991 revival TV series, and French actress Eva Green in the 2012 feature film directed by Tim Burton.\n\nAngélique was born as Miranda DuVal during the 17th century in the West Indies of Martinique. During her early teen years, Angélique travelled to America, where she became a faithful and loyal follower of a warlock named Judah Zachary. Judah took Angélique under his wing, and taught her the sacred arts of magic and witchcraft. One year later, both Angélique and Judah were captured and exposed as witches by the Catholic Church. Fearing her fate of death, Angélique betrayed Judah by testifying against him in exchange for her freedom.\n\nMiranda was later reincarnated as Angélique Bouchard. She was raised by Theodore Bouchard, who she believed to be her father, before coming to work for the duPres family. She is Countess Natalie duPres' servant, she follows her to Collinsport, Maine. However, after having a brief affair with Barnabas Collins, Angélique was heartbroken after Barnabas declared his love to another woman - Josette du Prés. After countless failed attempts to rekindling her romance with Barnabas, Angélique hexed a powerful spell to manipulate Josette’s love for Jeremiah Collins, Barnabas’ uncle. After Josette eloped with Jeremiah, Angelique coerced Barnabas into marrying her. However, after the discovery of her practices in witchcraft, Barnabas supposedly murdered Angélique. Before her \"death\", Angélique cursed Barnabas as a species of the undead and fell into a coma where she was presumed to die. Later, after her surprising survival, Angélique was devastated about what she did to Barnabas, and tried to reverse her spell. She is the first victim of her own curse, being in love with Barnabas. He strangles her in the secret room of the mausoleum. Her soul is claimed by The Dark Lord in exchange for letting Barnabas continue existing as a vampire through her curse rather than perish.\n\nDuring the early spring of 1968, Angélique changed her name to Cassandra Blair, and became the second wife of Roger Collins. Roger introduced his new bride to his family. She received a lukewarm welcome and Barnabas (who immediately recognized his former estranged wife) never doubted her true identity. Later, throughout the first year of their marriage, the happily married couple grow further and further apart. As Roger begins to realize his mistake in marrying \"Cassandra\", Angélique has affairs with multiple men - most notably Tony Peterson - of whom Elizabeth Collins Stoddard finds in the middle of one such affair and threaten to tell Roger. However, before having the chance to expose \"Cassandra\", Angélique hexes Elizabeth with a spell that surrenders her into a deathlike state. Believing her to be dead, the Collins family unknowingly buries Elizabeth alive.\n\nShe is destroyed by the Ghost of Reverend Trask, but is brought back from the dead and cursed as a vampire by Nicolas Blair. She attacks Joe Haskell on orders from Nicolas, and turns him into her slave. Then when Nicolas tells her she can have Barnabas, she no longer wants Joe and quits summoning him. She then turns on Barnabas and she bites him several times and turns him into her slave.\n\nAngelique traveled back to 1897 in order to further torment a time-traveling Barnabas. Initially a villain once more, she falls in love with Quentin Collins, and eventually becomes a firm ally in the enduring war against Andreas Petofi.\n\nAngelique's next storyline comes when she is discovered retired from witchcraft in 1970. After her marriage to Skyler Rumson, Angelique desired to live a normal life by renouncing her powers. After her encounter with Julia Hoffman, she claimed not be interested in the Collins family any longer. However, after the rise of the Leviathans, Barnabas sought her assistance and begged her for help. Though hesitant to practice magic again, Angelique reluctantly agreed. After the discovery of her husband’s allegiance to the Leviathans, Angelique abandoned Sky and took refuge in Collinsport at The Old House.\n\nA post-1795 Angelique is encountered in 1840 by Barnabas during his final TV storyline, where she has no knowledge of future events. Initially once more an antagonist, she eventually aids Barnabas against the threat of Judah Zachary and Lamar Trask, losing her powers in the process. Mortally wounded, she dies in Barnabas' arms, moments before he declares his love for her.\n\n\nIn 1998, Lara Parker made her writing debut with the novel \"Angelique's Descent\", which focused on Angelique’s early years in Martinique and her love affair with Barnabas Collins.\n\nIn 2006, she released a sequel, \"The Salem Branch\". She also wrote the introduction to the novel \"Dark Shadows: Dreams of the Dark\" (1999), written by Stephen Mark Rainey and Elizabeth Massie.\n\nLara released \"Wolf Moon Rising\" in 2013 and noted there would be a fourth book in the series that focuses on Victoria Winters coming back to Collinwood after her return to 1795.\n\nIn the 2012 \"Dark Shadows\" film, Angelique (portrayed by French actress Eva Green) is an amazingly powerful and resilient witch, and a successful local businesswoman and community symbol. Her interest in Barnabas, after he is unwittingly released from her imprisonment, is again inflamed and she immediately seeks him out.\n\nIn a single brief childhood scene establishing Angelique's early interest in Barnabas, the young Angelique (played by Raffey Cassidy) is shown with her mother, a servant, departing from Liverpool for \"the New World\" along with the Collins family. The childhood scene establishes, more intensively than the television series did, Angelique's class-based resentment of the Collins clan's privileges, for she is cautioned by her mother that she must accept her place, servitude, in the social structure of the time and not even gaze freely upon her \"betters\", including Barnabas. It is later learned that Angelique had caused the fatal accident that claimed Barnabas' parents' lives.\n\n"}

In the novel, the Escapist is a fictional character created by the comics writer protagonists. The character later featured in the metafictional work \"Michael Chabon Presents the Amazing Adventures of the Escapist\" and Brian K. Vaughan's comic \"The Escapists\".\n\nChabon created the Escapist as an homage to the heroes of the Golden Age of Comic Books. The character's abilities as an escape artist are inspired by escape artist Harry Houdini as well as Robin Hood and Albert Schweitzer. Another inspiration was the early illusionist career of comic book artist Jim Steranko.\n\nIntroduced in Chabon's novel in 2000, the Escapist is said to be the creation of the book's protagonists, the cousins Joe Kavalier and Sam Clay, a pair of Jewish comic book creators in the 1930s and 1940s. The character's modus operandi is part of a recurring theme of escapism in the novel, representing the imaginative and positive effects of escapism in superhero comics as well as Kavalier and Clay's attempts to escape from the troubles of their past. Joe Kavalier has fled to America from Nazi-occupied Prague in Europe, leaving the rest of his family behind. Unable to help them, he starts fleeing from himself and everyone trying to get close to him. Sam Clay also wants to escape from himself – both his polio-stricken body and repressed homosexuality.\n\nWithin the story, the Escapist makes his first appearance in \"Amazing Midget Radio Comics\" #1, published by Empire Comics, a former novelty device company. He provides Kavalier and Clay with a measure of success and fame. However, having signed the rights to the character to the publisher, they make comparatively little from the massively successful character.\n\nIn 2004, Chabon teamed with Dark Horse Comics to create an actual comic book series of the Escapist. Named \"Michael Chabon Presents the Amazing Adventures of the Escapist\", the comic chronicled the supposed decades-long publishing history of the character. The stories and text pieces were written with the concept that Kavalier and Clay were real people and that the Escapist had actually been a character from the Golden Age of Comics. As such, the stories in the anthology were frequently written and drawn in older or simpler styles, in homage to the comics of past eras.\n\nIn addition to the Escapist himself, the comic featured stories of other characters supposedly created by Kavalier and Clay, such as the heroine Luna Moth and villains such as the gun-wielding Mr. Machine Gun or The Saboteur.\n\nThe comic book won \"Best Anthology\" at the 2005 Eisner Awards. It is also notable for featuring the final story of The Spirit by the late Will Eisner, which appeared in issue #6 of \"The Escapist\".\n\nIn 2006, writer Brian K. Vaughan took on a 6-part mini-series titled \"The Escapists\", which follows a longtime fan's dreams of reviving the character in all new comic adventures. Partly mirroring the story of Kavalier and Clay, \"The Escapists\" focuses on Cleveland-born Jewish writer Max Roth, whose late father was an avid Escapist fan. Using his inheritance money to buy the rights to the character, Max teams with artist Case Weaver and letterer Denny Jones, the latter of whom dresses as the Escapist and stops a crime in an attempt to stir up publicity for their comic. Inevitably, things begin to spiral out of the trio's control.\n\nThe Escapist's true identity is Tom Mayflower. He is the crippled nephew of escape artist Max Mayflower (who performs under the stage name of Misterioso). When Max is fatally shot while performing onstage, he reveals that he isn't his real uncle, having rescued him from a cruel orphanage as a baby. He gives Tom a golden key and a costume, explaining that he was recruited long ago by a mysterious organization called the League of the Golden Key to fight tyranny and free the oppressed. With his dying breath, Max commissions Tom to carry on his work. As long as Tom is wearing the costume and the key, he finds that he is no longer lame of leg and can perform amazing feats of escapology. Tom uses his powers to fight crime under the guise of the Escapist, especially against the evil forces of the mysterious criminal network, the Iron Chain.\n\nLike The Shadow, the Escapist is assisted in his quest by specially gifted agents, his sidekicks, who include the former circus strongman Big Al, exotic Asian beauty Miss Plum Blossom, and Omar, an East Indian mystic who possesses the power of hypnosis.\n\nThe Escapist is also sometimes aided by his benefactors, the League of the Golden Key, a secret society dedicated to freeing the oppressed and imprisoned. They are the source of the mystic key that grants the Escapist his powers, having granted it to Tom's uncle after freeing him from kidnappers when he was younger. \n\nDuring World War II, the League makes the Escapist an emergency Champion of Freedom and grant him full access to the powers of the Golden Key. This temporarily grants the Escapist superhuman strength and agility, allowing him to openly combat the Axis forces (coinciding in the novel with Joe Kavalier's feeling of helplessness as the war continues to rage on, while he is unable to rescue his family from Nazi-occupied Europe). Following the war, the Escapist's abilities return to their original level.\n\nIn the comic-within-a-comic sequences of \"The Escapists\", Tom's final fate is revealed and a new Escapist takes up the mantle of the hero. Things are not quite as they appear however.\n\nIn a story meant to embody and comment on the darker \"grim and gritty\" trend of modern comics, the original Escapist is said to have been killed in action, leaving a young locksmith as his successor. The new Escapist is aided by a new Luna Moth, who claims to be the original Escapist's daughter. She is soon revealed as a fraud however and betrays him to his enemies. When all seems lost, the dark and violent world fades, revealed as a dream of Tom Mayflower, still very much alive. This coincides in the \"real world\" with Max Roth losing the rights to the Escapist to a corporation that prefers to revert the series to its classic style.\n\n"}

{"id": "2234191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2234191", "title": "Narrative paradigm", "text": "Narrative paradigm\n\nNarrative paradigm is a communication theory conceptualized by 20th-century communication scholar Walter Fisher. The paradigm claims that all meaningful communication occurs via storytelling or reporting of events. Humans participate as storytellers and observers of narratives. This theory further claims that stories are more persuasive than arguments. Essentially the narrative paradigm helps us to explain how humans are able to understand complex information through narrative.\n\nThe Narrative Paradigm is a theory that suggests that human beings are natural storytellers and that a good story is more convincing than a good argument. Walter Fisher developed this theory as a solution making cohesive arguments. Fisher conceptualized the paradigm as a way to combat issues in the public sphere. The problem was that human beings were unable to make cohesive traditional arguments. At the time, the rational world paradigm was the theory used to satisfy public controversies. He believed that stories have the power to include a beginning, middle, and end of an argument and that the rational world paradigm fails to be effective in sensemaking.\n\nFisher uses the term paradigm rather than theory, meaning a paradigm is broader than a theory. Fisher stated, \"There is no genre, including technical communication, that is not an episode in the story of life.\"\n\nFisher believed that humans are not rational and proposed that the narrative is the basis of communication. According to this viewpoint, people communicate by telling/observing a compelling story rather than by producing evidence or constructing a logical argument. The narrative paradigm is purportedly all-encompassing, allowing all communication to be looked at as a narrative even though it may not conform to the traditional literary requirements of a narrative. He states:\nStorytelling is one of the first language skills that children develop. It is universal across cultures and time.\n\nWalter Fisher conceptualized the Narrative Paradigm in direct contrast to the Rational World Paradigm. \"Fisher's interest in narrative developed out of his conclusion that the dominant model for explaining human communication—the rational-world paradigm—was inadequate.\" Rational World Paradigm suggest that an argument is most persuasive when it is logical. This theory is based on the teachings of Plato and Aristotle. \nAccording to Aristotle, some statements are superior to others by virtue of their relationship to true knowledge. This view claims that:\n\nNarrative rationality requires coherence and fidelity, which contribute to judgments about reasons.\n\nNarrative coherence is the degree to which a story makes sense. Coherent stories are internally consistent, with sufficient detail, strong characters, and free of significant surprises. The ability to assess coherence is learned and improves with experience. Individuals assess a story's adherence by comparing it with similar stories. The ultimate test of narrative sense is whether the characters act reliably. If figures show continuity throughout their thoughts, motives, and actions, acceptance increases. However, characters behaving uncharacteristically destroy acceptance.\n\nNarrative fidelity is the degree to which a story fits into the observer's experience with other accounts. How the experience of a story rings true with past stories they know to be true in their lives. Stories with fidelity may influence their beliefs and values.\n\nFisher set five criteria that affect a story's narrative fidelity. The first of the requirements are the values which are embedded in the story. The second of the elements is the connection between the story and the espoused value. The third of the criteria is the possible outcomes that would accrue to people adhering to the espoused values. The last two are firstly the consistency of the narrative's values with the observer's values and lastly the extent to which the story’s values represent the highest values possible in human experience.\n\nFisher's narrative paradigm offers an alternative to Aristotelian analysis, which dominates the field of rhetorical thinking. Narratives do not require training or expertise to evaluate. Common sense assesses narrative coherence and fidelity. Busselle and Bilandzic distinguish narrative rationality from realism, writing \"It is remarkable that the power of narrative is not diminished by readers’ or viewers’ knowledge that the story is invented. On the contrary, successful stories—those that engage us most—often are both fictional and unrealistic.\"\n\nAlternatively, Foucault claimed that communications systems formed through the savoir and pouvoir (knowledge and power) of the hierarchies that control access to the discourses. Hence, criteria for assessing the reliability and completeness of evidence, and whether the pattern of reasoning is sound are not absolutes but defined over time by those in positions of authority. This is particularly significant when the process of thinking includes values and policy in addition to empirical data.\n\nThe narrative paradigm instead asserts that any individual can judge a story's merits as a basis for belief and action.\n\nNarration affects every aspect of each individual's life in verbal and nonverbal bids for someone to believe or act in a certain way. Even when a message appears abstract—i.e., the language is literal and not figurative—it is narration. This is because it is embedded in the storyteller's ongoing story and it invites observers to assess its value for their own lives.\n\nNarrative rationality and narrative emotion are complementary within a narrative theory. The former considers how effectively the story conveys its meaning, as well as its implications. The latter considers the emotional reactions of the story's observers. Narrative emotion is an emotion felt for the sake of someone, or something, else.\n\nNarrative theory is an assessment framework within various fields of communication. Those who use narrative theory within their research refer to it as a general way of viewing communication. The narrative paradigm is generally considered an interpretative theory of communication. It is an especially useful theory for teaching qualitative research methods.\n\nFisher’s theory has been considered for domains ranging from organizational communication to family interaction, to racism, and to advertising. McNamara proposed that the narrative paradigm can be used with military storytelling to enhance the perception of the United States armed services. Stutts and Barker, of Virginia Commonwealth University, proposed that the Narrative Paradigm can be used to evaluate if a company's brand will be well received by consumers, by determining if the created narrative has coherence and fidelity. Other researchers proposed using the narrative paradigm to evaluate ethical standards in advertising. Roberts used the narrative paradigm as a way to better understand the use of narrative in folklore. Hobart proposed using narrative theory as a way to interpret urban legends and other kinds of hoaxes.\n\nNarrative paradigm is also applicable when assessing multinational working relationships. Global interactions between groups with different backgrounds have the tendency to hinder group progress and building relationships. Over the past two decades, scholars conceptualize diversity in the workplace using several different theories. As companies continue to diversify, businesses look for communication models to help manage the complex structure of human relationships. Narrative paradigm serves as a communication technique that shows companies how the application of a good story could provide benefits in the workforce. Storytelling is a cross-cultural solution that establishes credibility and trust in relationships between workers.\n\nSmith in 1984 conducted one example of a study that used narrative theory more directly. Smith looked at the fidelity and coherence of narratives presented as Republican and Democratic Party platforms in the United States and found that despite apparent differences, each party was able to maintain integrity and fidelity by remaining consistent in both structure and overarching party values.\n\nA study claimed that narrative features could be strategically altered by health communicators to affect the reader's identification. It found that similarities between the reader and the narrative's protagonist, but not the narrator's point of view, has a direct impact on the narrative's persuasiveness.\n\nNarrative processing can create or enhance connections between a brand and an audience. Companies and business use stories or brands that suggest a story to produce brand loyalty. Businesses invest heavily in creating a good story through advertising and public relations. In brand development, many marketers focus on defining a brand persona (typical user) before constructing a narrative for that brand. Character traits such as honesty, curiosity, flexibility and determination become embedded in the persona. Commitment to the associated behavioral implications can help the brand maintain consistency with its narrative.\n\nCritics of the narrative paradigm mainly contend that it is not as universally applicable as Fisher suggests. For example, Rowland asserted that it should be applied strictly to communication that fits classic narrative patterns to avoid undermining its credibility.\n\nOther critiques include issues of conservative bias. Kirkwood stated that Fisher's logic of good reasons focuses only on prevailing issues but does not see all the ways that stories can promote social change. In some ways, both Kirkwood and Fisher agree that this observation is more of an extension to the theory than a critique.\n\nStroud considered \"multivalent\" narratives that include seemingly contradictory values or positions that force a reader to reconstruct their meaning, thereby enabling positive judgments of narrative fidelity and the adoption of new values.\n\nSome forms of communication are not narrative in the way that Fisher maintains. Many science fiction and fantasy novels/movies challenge rather than conform to common values.\n\nThe narrative approach does not provide a more democratic structure compared to the one imposed by the rational world paradigm. Nor does it offer a complete alternative to that paradigm.\nThe narrative paradigm gained attention from poststructuralist education theorists for appealing to notions of truth.\n\nThe narrative paradigm incorporates both the pathos and logos form of rhetoric theory. Rhetoric theory was formulated by Aristotle. He defines rhetoric as: the available means of persuasion. It includes two assumptions. Firstly that effective public speakers must consider their audience. Secondly that effective public speakers supply proofs.\n\nAristotle divided public speaking into three parts: the speaker, the subject and the audience. He considered the audience the most important, determining the speech’s end and object. Therefore, audience analysis, which is the process of evaluating an audience and its background is essential.\n\nIn the second assumption, Aristotle’s proof refers to the means of persuasion. And these three proof types are Ethos, Pathos, and Logos.\n\nThere are three modes of ethos\n\n\nWhen people experience a story, the comprehension phase is where they form a mental representation of the text. Such a mental image is called a situation model. Situation models are representations of the state of affairs described in a document rather than of the text itself. Much of the research suggests that observers behave as though they are in the story rather than outside of it. This supports Fisher’s model that narrative components backed by good reasons are related to elements in situation models.\n\nSituation models represent relevant aspects of the narrative's environment. Objects that are spatially close to observers are generally more relevant than more distant objects. The same holds for situation models. Observers are similarly slower to recognize words denoting objects distant from a protagonist than those close to the protagonist. When observers have extensive knowledge of the spatial layout of the story setting (e.g., a building), they update their representations according to the location and goals of the protagonist. They have the fastest mental access to the room that the protagonist is close to. For example, they can more readily say whether two objects are in the same room if the room mentioned is close to the protagonist. The interpretation of the meaning of a verb denoting the movement of people or objects in space, such as to approach, depends on their situation models. The interpretation of observers also depends on the size of the landmark and the speed of the figure. Observers behave as if they are actually present in the situation.\n\nIn one study observers recognized goals yet to be accomplished by the protagonist more quickly than goals that had just been accomplished. When Keefe and McDaniel presented subjects with sentences such as \"after standing through a 3-hour debate, the tired speaker walked over to his chair (and sat down)\" and then with probe words (e.g., \"sat\"). Subjects took about the same amount of time to name sat when the clause about the speaker sitting down was omitted and when it was included. Moreover, naming times were significantly faster in both of these conditions than in a control condition, in which it was implied that the speaker remained standing.\n\n"}
{"id": "2234192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2234192", "title": "Reduction potential", "text": "Reduction potential\n\nRedox potential (also known as reduction / oxidation potential, 'ROP', pe, ε, or formula_1) is a measure of the tendency of a chemical species to acquire electrons from or lose electrons to an electrode and thereby be reduced or oxidised respectively. Redox potential is measured in volts (V), or millivolts (mV). Each species has its own intrinsic redox potential; for example, the more positive the reduction potential (reduction potential is more often used due to general formalism in electrochemistry), the greater the species<nowiki>'</nowiki> affinity for electrons and tendency to be reduced. ORP can reflect the antimicrobial potential of the water.\n\nIn aqueous solutions, redox potential is a measure of the tendency of the solution to either gain or lose electrons when it is subjected to change by introduction of a new species. A solution with a higher (more positive) reduction potential than the new species will have a tendency to gain electrons from the new species (i.e. to be reduced by oxidizing the new species) and a solution with a lower (more negative) reduction potential will have a tendency to lose electrons to the new species (i.e. to be oxidized by reducing the new species). Because the absolute potentials are next to impossible to accurately measure, reduction potentials are defined relative to a reference electrode. Reduction potentials of aqueous solutions are determined by measuring the potential difference between an inert sensing electrode in contact with the solution and a stable reference electrode connected to the solution by a salt bridge.\n\nThe sensing electrode acts as a platform for electron transfer to or from the reference half cell. It is typically platinum, although gold and graphite can be used as well. The reference half cell consists of a redox standard of known potential. The standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is the reference from which all standard redox potentials are determined and has been assigned an arbitrary half cell potential of 0.0 mV. However, it is fragile and impractical for routine laboratory use. Therefore, other more stable reference electrodes such as silver chloride and saturated calomel (SCE) are commonly used because of their more reliable performance.\n\nAlthough measurement of the redox potential in aqueous solutions is relatively straightforward, many factors limit its interpretation, such as effects of solution temperature and pH, irreversible reactions, slow electrode kinetics, non-equilibrium, presence of multiple redox couples, electrode poisoning, small exchange currents and inert redox couples. Consequently, practical measurements seldom correlate with calculated values. Nevertheless, reduction potential measurement has proven useful as an analytical tool in monitoring changes in a system rather than determining their absolute value (e.g. process control and titrations).\n\nSimilar to how the concentration of hydrogen ion determines the acidity or pH of an aqueous solution, the tendency of electron transfer between a chemical species and an electrode determines the redox potential of an electrode couple. Like pH, redox potential represents how easily electrons are transferred to or from species in solution. Redox potential characterises the ability under the specific condition of a chemical species to lose or gain electrons instead of the amount of electrons available for oxidation or reduction.\n\nIn fact, it is possible to define pe, the negative logarithm of electron concentration (−log[e]) in a solution, which will be directly proportional to the redox potential. Sometimes pe is used as a unit of reduction potential instead of formula_2, for example, in environmental chemistry. If we normalize pe of hydrogen to zero, we will have the relation pe = 16.9 formula_2 at room temperature. This point of view is useful for understanding redox potential, although the transfer of electrons, rather than the absolute concentration of free electrons in thermal equilibrium, is how one usually thinks of redox potential. Theoretically, however, the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nConversely, one could define a potential corresponding to pH as a potential difference between a solute and pH neutral water, separated by porous membrane (that is permeable to hydrogen ions). Such potential differences actually do occur from differences in acidity on biological membranes. This potential (where pH neutral water is set to 0 V) is analogous with redox potential (where standardized hydrogen solution is set to 0 V), but instead of hydrogen ions, electrons are transferred across in the redox case. Both pH and redox potentials are properties of solutions, not of elements or chemical compounds themselves, and depend on concentrations, temperature etc.\n\nThe standard reduction potential (formula_4) is measured under standard conditions: 25 °C, a 1 activity for each ion participating in the reaction, a partial pressure of 1 bar for each gas that is part of the reaction, and metals in their pure state. The standard reduction potential is defined relative to a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) reference electrode, which is arbitrarily given a potential of 0.00 V. However, because these can also be referred to as \"redox potentials\", the terms \"reduction potentials\" and \"oxidation potentials\" are preferred by the IUPAC. The two may be explicitly distinguished in symbols as formula_5 and formula_6.\n\nThe relative reactivities of different half cells can be compared to predict the direction of electron flow. A higher formula_4 means there is a greater tendency for reduction to occur, while a lower one means there is a greater tendency for oxidation to occur.\n\nAny system or environment that accepts electrons from a normal hydrogen electrode is a half cell that is defined as having a positive redox potential; any system donating electrons to the hydrogen electrode is defined as having a negative redox potential. formula_1 is measured in millivolts (mV). A high positive formula_1 indicates an environment that favors oxidation reaction such as free oxygen. A low negative formula_1 indicates a strong reducing environment, such as free metals.\n\nSometimes when electrolysis is carried out in an aqueous solution, water, rather than the solute, is oxidized or reduced. For example, if an aqueous solution of NaCl is electrolyzed, water may be reduced at the cathode to produce H and OH ions, instead of Na being reduced to Na, as occurs in the absence of water. It is the reduction potential of each species present that will determine which species will be oxidized or reduced.\n\nAbsolute reduction potentials can be determined if we find the actual potential between electrode and electrolyte for any one reaction. Surface polarization interferes with measurements, but various sources give an estimated potential for the standard hydrogen electrode of 4.4 V to 4.6 V (the electrolyte being positive.)\n\nHalf-cell equations can be combined if one is reversed to an oxidation in a manner that cancels out the electrons to obtain an equation without electrons in it.\n\nThe formula_2 and pH of a solution are related. For a half cell equation, conventionally written as reduction (electrons on the left side):\n\nThe half-cell standard potential formula_13 is given by\n\nwhere formula_15 is the standard Gibbs free energy change, is the number of electrons involved, and is Faraday's constant. The Nernst equation relates pH and formula_2:\n\nwhere curly brackets indicate activities, and exponents are shown in the conventional manner. This equation is the equation of a straight line for formula_2 as a function of pH with a slope of formula_19 volt (pH has no units). This equation predicts lower formula_2 at higher pH values. This is observed for reduction of O to OH and for reduction of H to H. If H were on the opposite side of the equation from H, the slope of the line would be reversed (higher formula_2 at higher pH). \nAn example of that would be the formation of magnetite (FeO) from HFeO:\n\nwhere . Note that the slope of the line is −1/2 of the −0.05916 value above, since .\n\nMany enzymatic reactions are oxidation–reduction reactions, in which one compound is oxidized and another compound is reduced. The ability of an organism to carry out oxidation–reduction reactions depends on the oxidation–reduction state of the environment, or its reduction potential (formula_2).\n\nStrictly aerobic microorganisms are generally active at positive formula_2 values, whereas strict anaerobes are generally active at negative formula_2 values. Redox affects the solubility of nutrients, especially metal ions.\n\nThere are organisms that can adjust their metabolism to their environment, such as facultative anaerobes. Facultative anaerobes can be active at positive \"E\" values, and at negative \"E\" values in the presence of oxygen-bearing inorganic compounds, such as nitrates and sulfates.\n\nIn the field of environmental chemistry, the reduction potential is used to determine if oxidizing or reducing conditions are prevalent in water or soil, and to predict the states of different chemical species in the water, such as dissolved metals. pe values in water range from -12 to 25; the levels where the water itself becomes reduced or oxidized, respectively.\n\nThe reduction potentials in natural systems often lie comparatively near one of the boundaries of the stability region of water. Aerated surface water, rivers, lakes, oceans, rainwater and acid mine water, usually have oxidizing conditions (positive potentials). In places with limitations in air supply, such as submerged soils, swamps and marine sediments, reducing conditions (negative potentials) are the norm. Intermediate values are rare and usually a temporary condition found in systems moving to higher or lower pe values.\n\nIn environmental situations, it is common to have complex non-equilibrium conditions between a large number of species, meaning that it is often not possible to make accurate and precise measurements of the reduction potential. However, it is usually possible to obtain an approximate value and define the conditions as being in the oxidizing or reducing regime.\n\nIn the soil there are two main redox constituents: 1) anorganic redox systems (mainly ox/red compounds of Fe and Mn) and measurement in water extracts; 2) natural soil samples with all microbial and root components and measurement by direct method [Husson O. et al.: Practical improvements in soil redox potential (formula_1) measurement for characterisation of soil properties. Application for comparison of conventional and conservation agriculture cropping systems. Anal. Chim. Acta 906 (2016): 98-109].\n\nOxidation reduction potential (ORP) can be used for water system monitoring with the benefit of a single-value measure of the disinfection potential, showing the activity of the disinfectant rather than the applied dose. For example, \"E. coli\", \"Salmonella\", \"Listeria\" and other pathogens have survival times of under 30 s when the ORP is above 665 mV, compared against >300 s when it is below 485 mV.\n\nA study was conducted comparing traditional parts per million chlorination reading and ORP in Hennepin County, Minnesota. The results of this study argue for the inclusion of ORP above 650mV in local health codes.\n\n\"E\"–pH (Pourbaix) diagrams are commonly used in mining and geology for assessment of the stability fields of minerals and dissolved species. Under the conditions where a mineral (solid) phase is predicted to be the most stable form of an element, these diagrams show that mineral. As the predicted results are all from thermodynamic (at equilibrium state) evaluations, these diagrams should be used with caution. Although the formation of a mineral or its dissolution may be predicted to occur under a set of conditions, the process may practically be negligible because its rate is too slow. Consequently, kinetic evaluations at the same time are necessary. Nevertheless, the equilibrium conditions can be used to evaluate the direction of spontaneous changes and the magnitude of the driving force behind them.\n\n\n\n"}

High voltage is applied to a liquid supplied through an emitter (usually a glass or metallic capillary). Ideally the liquid reaching the emitter tip forms a Taylor cone, which emits a liquid jet through its apex. Varicose waves on the surface of the jet lead to the formation of small and highly charged liquid droplets, which are radially dispersed due to Coulomb repulsion.\n\nIn the late 16th century William Gilbert set out to describe the behaviour of magnetic and electrostatic phenomena. He observed that, in the presence of a charged piece of amber, a drop of water deformed into a cone. This effect is clearly related to electrosprays, even though Gilbert did not record any observation related to liquid dispersion under the effect of the electric field.\n\nIn 1750 the French clergyman and physicist Jean-Antoine (Abbé) Nollet noted water flowing from a vessel would aerosolize if the vessel was electrified and placed near electrical ground. He also noted that similarly \"a person, electrified by connection to a high-voltage generator, would not bleed normally if he were to cut himself; blood would spray from the wound\".\n\nIn 1882, Lord Rayleigh theoretically estimated the maximum amount of charge a liquid droplet could carry; this is now known as the \"Rayleigh limit\". His prediction that a droplet reaching this limit would throw out fine jets of liquid was confirmed experimentally more than 100 years later.\n\nIn 1914, John Zeleny published work on the behaviour of fluid droplets at the end of glass capillaries. This report presents experimental evidence for several electrospray operating regimes (dripping, burst, pulsating, and cone-jet). A few years later, Zeleny captured the first time-lapse images of the dynamic liquid meniscus. \nBetween 1964 and 1969 Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor produced the theoretical underpinning of electrospraying. Taylor modeled the shape of the cone formed by the fluid droplet under the effect of an electric field; this characteristic droplet shape is now known as the Taylor cone. He further worked with J. R. Melcher to develop the \"leaky dielectric model\" for conducting fluids.\n\nTo simplify the discussion, the following paragraphs will address the case of a positive electrospray with the high voltage applied to a metallic emitter. A classical electrospray setup is considered, with the emitter situated at a distance formula_1 from a grounded counter-electrode. The liquid being sprayed is characterized by its viscosity formula_2, surface tension formula_3, conductivity formula_4, and relative permittivity formula_5.\n\nUnder the effect of surface tension, the liquid meniscus assumes a semi-spherical shape at the tip of the emitter. Application of the positive voltage formula_6 will induce the electric field:\nwhere formula_8 is the liquid radius of curvature. This field leads to liquid polarization: the negative/positive charge carriers migrate toward/away from the electrode where the voltage is applied. At voltages below a certain threshold, the liquid quickly reaches a new equilibrium geometry with a smaller radius of curvature.\n\nVoltages above the threshold draw the liquid into a cone. Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor described the theoretical shape of this cone based on the assumptions that (1) the surface of the cone is an equipotential surface and (2) the cone exists in a steady state equilibrium. To meet both of these criteria the electric field must have azimuthal symmetry and have formula_9 dependence to balance the surface tension and produce the cone. The solution to this problem is:\n\nwhere formula_11 (equipotential surface) exists at a value of formula_12 (regardless of R) producing an equipotential cone. The magic angle necessary for formula_11 for all R is a zero of the Legendre polynomial of order 1/2, formula_14. There is only one zero between 0 and formula_15 at 130.7099°, which is the complement of the Taylor's now famous 49.3° angle.\n\nThe apex of the conical meniscus cannot become infinitely small. A singularity develops when the hydrodynamic relaxation time formula_16 becomes larger than the charge relaxation time formula_17. The undefined symbols stand for characteristic length formula_18 and vacuum permittivity formula_19. Due to intrinsic varicose instability, the charged liquid jet ejected through the cone apex breaks into small charged droplets, which are radially dispersed by the space-charge.\n\nThe charged liquid is ejected through the cone apex and captured on the counter electrode as charged droplets or positive ions. To balance the charge loss, the excess negative charge is neutralized electrochemically at the emitter. Imbalances between the amount of charge generated electrochemically and the amount of charge lost at the cone apex can lead to several electrospray operating regimes. For cone-jet electrosprays, the potential at the metal/liquid interface self-regulates to generate the same amount of charge as that lost through the cone apex.\n\nElectrospray became widely used as ionization source for mass spectrometry after the Fenn group successfully demonstrated its use as ion source for the analysis of large biomolecules.\n\nA liquid metal ion source (LMIS) uses electrospray in conjunction with liquid metal to form ions. Ions are produced by field evaporation at tip of the Taylor cone. Ions from a LMIS are used in ion implantation and in focused ion beam instruments.\n\nSimilarly to the standard electrospray, the application of high voltage to a polymer solution can result in the formation of a cone-jet geometry. If the jet turns into very fine fibers instead of breaking into small droplets, the process is known as electrospinning .\n\nElectrospray techniques are used as low thrust electric propulsion rocket engines to control satellites, since the fine-controllable particle ejection allows precise and effective thrust.\n\nElectrospray may be used in nanotechnology, for example to deposit single particles on surfaces. This is done by spraying colloids on average containing only one particle per droplet. The solvent evaporates, leaving an aerosol stream of single particles of the desired type. The ionizing property of the process is not crucial for the application but may be used in electrostatic precipitation of the particles.\n\nInstead of depositing nanoparticles, nanoparticles and nano structures can also fabricated in situ by depositing metal ions to desired locations. Electrochemical reduction of ions to atoms and in situ assembly was believed to be the mechanism of nano structure formation.\n\nElectrospray has garnered attention in the field of drug delivery, and it has been used to fabricate drug carriers including polymer microparticles used in immunotherapy as well as lipoplexes used for nucleic acid delivery. The sub-micrometer-sized drug particles created by electrospray possess increased dissolution rates, thus increased bioavailability due to the increased surface area. The side-effects of drugs can thus be reduced, as smaller dosage is enough for the same effect.\n\nElectrospray is used in some air purifiers. Particulate suspended in air can be charged by aerosol electrospray, manipulated by an electric field, and collected on a grounded electrode. This approach minimizes the production of ozone which is common to other types of air purifiers.\n"}

He was one of the wealthiest industrialists of the Victorian era.\n\nSeely was born and educated in Lincoln. His parents were Charles Seely (1768–1809) and Ann Wilkinson of Lincoln. He married Mary Hilton in 1831.\n\nIn 1864, Seely was the Deputy Lieutenant for Lincolnshire, when he played host to the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi, when Garibaldi visited 26 Prince's Gate Hyde Park, his house in London and Seely's estate at Brook House on the Isle of Wight. Garibaldi stayed at Brook House from 3 to 11 April, during which time he was also joined by Giuseppe Mazzini, the Italian writer and politician whose efforts helped bring about the modern Italian state. During this time Garibaldi raised funds for his Italian campaigns. On 11 April Garibaldi left Brook House with Seely and travelled from Southampton to London, where he was greeted by crowds estimated at half a million people, according to the \"Illustrated London News\". Garibaldi stayed several days at Seely's house in London where a reception was hosted for him on 19 April. The next day he travelled to the Guildhall where he was given the Freedom of the City of London.\n\nSeely made his fortune in the Industrial Revolution through milling, agricultural machinery and coal mining. On his death in 1887, “his personal estate was valued at almost £500,000, and real estate worth £2 million”, equivalent to 322 million UK Pounds in 2018 or 2 billion UK pounds as a proportion of UK GDP.. He was chairman of the House of Commons Committee on Admiralty Reform in 1868. In a \"Vanity Fair\" \"Spy\" cartoon of 1878, on notable people of the day, he was caricatured as \"Pigs\". He later diversified his fortune into acquiring coal mines and property: in 1883 he owned 9,264 acres on the Isle of Wight, 2,929 in Worcestershire and 394 in Bedfordshire. By 1900 the family estates in the Isle of Wight comprised almost the entire west side of the island.\n\nIn the 1870s he commissioned Myles Birket Foster to paint 50 watercolours of Venice.\n\nFive other members of his family became Members of Parliament during the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries:\n\nAdditionally, his great-grandson David Peter Seely, 4th Baron Mottistone, who was baptised with Winston Churchill and the then Prince of Wales (subsequently Edward VIII) as his godparents, was the Deputy Lieutenant for Lincolnshire, Lord Lieutenant of the Isle of Wight and its last Governor. His youngest sister Jane Anne Seely married (1882) Henry George Gore-Browne who received the Victoria Cross during the Indian Mutiny in 1857.

The operation's objectives were then changed to the Manshiya Neighborhood Youth Club and the Tel Aviv Opera Building. The contingency plan in case the original targets could not be located was to select any nearby buildings that were populated as targets.\n\nThe attackers were told to take hostages, then demand the release of Palestinian prisoners, as well as air transport out of Israel to Damascus. If the negotiations failed, they were told to kill their hostages and commit suicide. In the event of capture, they were instructed to tell their interrogators that they had come from Egypt, in the hope that this would result in a breakdown of ongoing Israeli-Egyptian peace negotiations, and to direct Israeli retaliation away from Lebanon.\n\nAt 11:00 p.m. on the night of 4 March 1975, eight Palestinians in two teams landed by boat on the Tel Aviv beach at the foot of Allenby Street. They had departed from the Lebanese port of Sarafenda, near Tyre on an Egyptian merchant vessel. When they were about 60 miles off Tel Aviv, the teams were lowered in a boat, and landed on the shore. As they landed on the shore, they were spotted by police officers in a patrol vehicle that was passing by. The officers in the car opened fire at them, and one of the boats which was stocked with weapons was hit and exploded. The militants escaped the beach onto a street corner, leaving much of their weaponry behind in the boats. They then crossed onto Herbert Samuel Street, where they shot and threw grenades. Unable to locate their original targets, they tried but failed to break into a cinema. Afterwards, they continued down the street and took over the Savoy Hotel, at the corner of HaYarkon and Geula streets, near the center of the city. The Savoy Hotel was picked due to it being the only illuminated building on the street. During the takeover of the hotel, three people were killed. Three people managed to escape in the confusion, but most guests and staff were taken hostage and taken to the top floor of the building.\n\nPrivate Moshe Deutschmann, a soldier from the Israeli army's Golani Brigade who was on home leave at the time, grabbed his weapon and ran to the hotel after hearing gunfire. Meanwhile, some militants attempted to leave the hotel. Deutschmann saw them at the entrance to the hotel and engaged them. In the exchange of fire, Deutschmann was hit. He managed to crawl away, and was later evacuated to Hadassah Medical Center, where he died of his injuries. Deutschmann was posthumously awarded the Medal of Distinguished Service.\n\nIsraeli security forces soon arrived on the scene, and the Palestinians barricaded themselves in the hotel with their hostages, detonated an explosive charge which caused part of the building to collapse, and threatened that if Israel did not release 20 Palestinian prisoners within four hours, the hostages would be executed. According to an eyewitness account:\n\nWhen I went into the street, I saw a nightmarish spectacle. Red tracer bullets streaked through the night air. The four-story Savoy Hotel, illuminated by floodlights, was surrounded by troops, local police and border police in full battle regalia. Military vehicles, armored cars and personnel carriers clogged the surrounding streets. Red Magen David ambulance crews were administering first aid to wounded civilians on the sidewalks and gutters. Looking out to sea, the blinding light of magnesium flares revealed naval patrol boats cruising just off the beach.\n\nIsraeli security forces conducted negotiations with the militants. One hostage, Kochava Levy, became a mediator between the security forces and militants, as she spoke Arabic. During the negotiations, Levy provided the security forces detailed information on the militants.\n\nEarly the next morning, the Israeli counter-terrorism unit Sayeret Matkal stormed the hotel, killing seven of the perpetrators and capturing the eighth. One Sayeret Matkal officer, Colonel Uzi Yairi, was also killed. Five hostages were freed, while five were killed.\n\nA few hours after the rescue operation, the boat that had transported the militants was captured on the high seas by the Israeli Navy. After the boat was detected by a reconnaissance aircraft, the Sa'ar 3-class missile boat INS \"Ga'ash\" and the Sa'ar 2-class missile boat INS \"Miznak\" moved to intercept it. They captured the boat about 70 miles off the coast of Hadera, and its crew was arrested. Two of the crew, who were Egyptian, were released, while the others were tried and convicted. One was sentenced to life imprisonment, while three others were given prison terms of 5–10 years.\n\nMembers of the Savoy cell included Musa Juma al-Tallka, the sole survivor, Muhammad Mashala, Hader Muhammad, Ziad Talk al-Zrir, Musa Awad, Muhammed al-Masri, Abu al-Lel, and Ahmed Hamid, who were all killed by the Israeli troops. Tallka was tried in a military court, convicted, and sentenced to death by hanging in March 1976. His death sentence was commuted. The bodies of those killed were released by the IDF in May 2012.\n\nThe partially destroyed Savoy Hotel was completely demolished, and a new hotel of the same name was built in its place. The new Savoy Hotel opened in 1987. At its entrance is a memorial plaque with the names of the victims of the attack.\n\nIn August 2012, it was reported that the Ramallah municipality approved the construction of a mausoleum to honor the eight Palestinians who were involved in the attack (the vote was initially reported by the PA daily newspaper Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and subsequently translated into English by Palestinian Media Watch). The decision to build the mausoleum coincides with the return of the perpetrators' remains, which were among the bodies of 91 Palestinian militants repatriated to the Palestinian Authority in June 2012 as an Israeli good-will gesture.\n\n"}

He has held NWA Zero-One's United States Championship twice and Ultimate Pro Wrestling's first Heavyweight Champion.\n\nWhile attending North Carolina State University, he finished second in the 1992 NCAA Division I Heavyweight tournament, losing to future Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle by points, 2-1, and later became champion in 1993. According to Angle's autobiography \"It's True, It's True\", Terkay had 78 pins during his college career.\n\nAfter training under Rick Bassman's Ultimate Pro Wrestling school in California, Terkay was signed to a WWE developmental contract, but later released. He joined Japanese pro wrestling promotion Pro Wrestling Zero1 in 2001 under the ring name The Predator, patterned after Bruiser Brody's character.\n\nAfter more training with WWE's Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) developmental territory, Terkay was brought up to the main roster of \"SmackDown!\" on July 28, 2006 working an MMA gimmick with Elijah Burke, who acted as his cornerman. Terkay defeated Matt Hardy in his debut match on \"SmackDown!\". In the following weeks, Terkay dominated jobbers as well as later interfering in Burke's matches. On the October 20 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Terkay helped Burke defeat Vito, breaking his 4-month undefeated streak. On the November 7, 2006 edition of WWE's \"ECW on Sci Fi\", Terkay and his associate Elijah Burke debuted in ECW by doing a backstage promo. Their undefeated streak as a tag team was ended when The Hardys defeated them on \"ECW\". At ECW's December To Dismember Terkay and Burke defeated The F.B.I. (Little Guido Maritato and Tony Mamaluke). In a backstage ECW promo Burke and Terkay dubbed themselves as the \"Knock-out Tap-out Connection\", a reference to Terkay's MMA and kickboxing background and Burke's amateur boxing background. He accompanied Burke to his matches in a bodyguard-type role for the next several weeks. Terkay remained undefeated in TV singles competition. On January 18, 2007, Terkay was released from his WWE contract.\n\nAfter leaving the WWE, Terkay returned to wrestling for the Japanese promotions of Inoki Genome Federation (IGF) and Pro Wrestling Zero1 and wrestled under his alter ego The Predator.\n\nOn March 31, 2012 Terkay worked his last match which took place in Georgetown, Guyana for the WrestleRama event.\n\nDuring his time in Zero1, Terkay also fought in several mixed martial arts (MMA) matches for K-1. He made his debut by knocking his opponent Mauricio da Silva out in 13 seconds as part of the annual K-1 New Year's Eve spectacular, K-1 Dynamite. He returned at the Romanex event in 2004, facing Ultimate Fighting Championship and PRIDE Fighting Championships veteran Gary Goodridge. Despite Terkay's size advantage, experience played in Goodridge's favor and he finished Sylvester in 1:22.\n\nAlso in 2004, however, Terkay defeated K-1 veteran Kristof Midoux, former trainer of Georges St-Pierre and Choi Mu-Bae, submitting him with a wrestling neck crank. This attracted a revenge match against Mu-Bae, which was won again by Terkay by unanimous decision in his last MMA venture. It was reported he had trouble getting fight contracts, as his lack of name value mixed with his good performances were seen as dangerous to established stars.\n\nIn December 2005, Terkay made his kickboxing debut against Remy Bonjasky in K-1 Premium 2005, losing the match in a controversial unanimous decision. The normally polite Japanese audience booed heavily at this outcome, feeling Terkay was the true winner, and K-1 chairman Sadaharu Tanikawa agreed their opinion in the post-event press conference.\n\nTerkay had his second and last kickboxing fight at K-1 Las Vegas, facing fellow superheavyweight Choi Hong-man, who came similarly from losing to Remy Bonjasky. Hong-man scored an early knockdown, but Terkay come back soon and fought a back and forth first round. The second was not different, with the Korean taking another point by knockdown and making Terkay bleed, only for Terkay to rally back and almost drop the Korean down before the bell rang. At the third, Terkay controlled an exhausted Choi, harassing him with combinations against the ropes until the end of the match. The decision was given to Choi due to the points scored. As in the previous match, the audience booed the decision, again feeling that Terkay was the victor and that the score system did not do justice to the match.\n\nTerkay has appeared in multiple films and TV shows over the years. He appeared in the 2001 movie \"Slammed\" along with former wrestling personality Zeus. He appeared on an episode of \"In the House\" as a Santa Imposter, and also appeared on the game show \"Distraction\" and bodyslammed contestants while they tried to answer questions. He made an appearance in the 2006 movie \"Evil Bong\" as a nightclub bouncer. He appeared in the 2010 movie \"True Legend\" as a fighter named Elder Scot Brother. He also appeared in the movie/documentary \"101 Reasons Not To Be A Pro Wrestler\", where he talked about his views on the wrestling business. In the 2014 film \"Pro Wrestlers vs Zombies\", Terkay makes a cameo appearance as a zombie wrestler who fights Kurt Angle.\n\nFilm\nTelevision\n\n!style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"| Result\n!style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"| Opponent\n!style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"| Method\n!style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"| Event\n!style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"| Date\n!style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"| Round, Time\n!style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"| Notes\n\n\n\n\n"}
