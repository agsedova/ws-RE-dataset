He seems to fit into a 7-year period in the Turin Canon for which there is no recorded king.\n\nHe is known from a few inscriptions in Wadi Hammamat that record expeditions to the Red Sea coast and to quarry stone for the royal monuments. It seems that he was a son of his predecessor.\n\nAlso, he is attested by the inscriptions at Wadi el-Hudi. Another relevant inscription is found in Ain Sukhna. These locations were the usual staging harbours for the expeditions to the Sinai.\n\nDespite Mentuhotep's obscurity (he is absent from the official king lists in Abydos), the inscriptions show the organization and makeup of a large expedition during his reign. The leader of an expedition to Wadi Hammamat, during the second year of Mentuhotep IV’s reign, was his vizier, Amenemhat, who is assumed to be the future king Amenemhat I, the first king of the 12th Dynasty, and Mentuhotep's immediate successor.\n\nA fragment of a slate bowl found at Lisht North was regarded for a long time to be inscribed on the outside with the official titulary of Mentuhotep IV, and on the inside with that of King Amenemhat I, his successor. Since the two inscriptions are incised in a different style of writing, according to Dorothea Arnold, this indicates that Amenemhat had his name added to an older vessel that already bore the name of Mentuhotep IV. However, Peter Janosi showed that Mentuhotep IV is not mentioned on the bowl, the titulary preserved there fits better to Mentuhotep II.\n\nIt is assumed by some Egyptologists that Amenemhat either usurped the throne or assumed power after Mentuhotep IV died childless. There is currently no archaeological or textual evidence to prove that Mentuhotep was deposed by his vizier or that he chose Amenemhat to be his designated successor. Neither his mummy nor his burial place have been found.\n"}

The name stems from the cost of restaurants literally printing new menus, but economists use it to refer to the costs of changing nominal prices in general. In this broader definition, menu costs might include updating computer systems, re-tagging items, and hiring consultants to develop new pricing strategies as well as the literal costs of printing menus. More generally, the menu cost can be thought of as resulting from costs of information, decision and implementation resulting in bounded rationality. Because of this expense, firms sometimes do not always change their prices with every change in supply and demand, leading to nominal rigidity. \nGenerally, the effect on the firm of small shifts in price (by changes in supply and/or demand, or else because of slight adjustments in monetary policy) is relatively minor compared to the costs of notifying the public of this new information. Therefore, the firm would rather exist in slight disequilibrium than incur the menu costs.\n\nThe concept of a lump-sum cost (menu cost) to changing the price was originally introduced by Sheshinski and Weiss (1977) in their paper looking at the effect of inflation on the frequency of price-changes. The idea of applying it as a general theory of Nominal Price Rigidity was simultaneously put forward by several in 1985–6. George Akerlof and Janet Yellen put forward the idea that due to bounded rationality firms will not want to change their price unless the benefit is more than a small amount. This bounded rationality leads to inertia in nominal prices and wages which can lead to output fluctuating at constant nominal prices and wages. Gregory Mankiw took the menu-cost idea and focused on the welfare effects of changes in output resulting from sticky prices. Michael Parkin also put forward the idea. The menu cost idea was also extended to wages as well as prices by Olivier Blanchard and Nobuhiro Kiyotaki.\n\nThe new Keynesian explanation of price stickiness relied on introducing imperfect competition with price (and wage) setting agents. This started a shift in macroeconomics away from using the model of perfect competition with price taking agents to using imperfectly competitive equilibria with price and wage setting agents (mostly adopting monopolistic competition). Huw Dixon and Claus Hansen showed that even if menu costs applied to a small sector of the economy, this would influence the rest of the economy and lead to prices in the rest of the economy becoming less responsive to changes in demand.\n\nIn 2007, Mikhail Golosov and Robert Lucas found that the size of the menu cost needed to match the micro-data of price adjustment inside an otherwise standard business cycle model is implausibly large to justify the menu-cost argument. The reason is that such models lack \"real rigidity\". This is a property that markups do not get squeezed by large adjustment in factor prices (such as wages) that could occur in response to the monetary shock. Modern New Keynesian models address this issue by assuming that the labor market is segmented, so that the expansion in employment by a given firm does not lead to lower profits for the other firms.\n\nConsider a hypothetical firm in a hypothetical economy, with a concave graph describing the relationship between the price of its good and the firm's corresponding profit. As always, the profit maximizing point lies at the very top for the curve.\n\nNow suppose that there exists a drop in aggregate output. While this causes real wages to fall (shifting the profit curve upward, allowing more profit for the same price), it also diminishes demand for the firm's product (shifting the curve down). Suppose the net effect is a downward shift (as it usually is).\n\nThe result is a maximum profit associated with a lower price (the max profit shifts to the left a bit, as a result of the profit curve moving). Suppose the old price (and thus the old maximizing profit price) was M and the new maximizing price is N. Also suppose the new maximum profit is B and new profit corresponding to the old price is A. Thus price M yields A in profit and price N yields B in profit.\n\nNow suppose there is a menu cost, Z, in changing from price M to price N. Because the firm must pay Z to make this change, they will only pay it if Z < B-A. Thus tiny fluctuations in the economy leads to small differences in B and A so firms do not change their price, even if Z is small.\n\nNote that if Z is zero, then prices will change all the time, allowing for firms to squeeze out every bit of profit from every change in the economy.\n"}

In the 1980s, Letica was a professor of sociology of medicine at the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb and a consultant for the World Health Organization, working on health service management projects in a number of countries in Europe, Asia and Africa.\n\nIn late 1980s, as the Communist grip on public discourse weakened, Letica began to use new freedoms to advocate various reforms. In doing so, he wrote many articles and columns and he began to appear in television talk shows and town hall meetings, quickly becoming one of the most popular and the most recognisable intellectuals in Yugoslavia.\n\nIn May 1990, after the first democratic elections, Franjo Tuđman made him his personal advisor. During negotiations which Tuđman pursued with the leader of the Serbs in Croatia, Jovan Rašković, Letica leaked the transcript of the secretly recorded conversation between Tuđman and Rašković to the Croatian media, hoping that some of Rašković's controversial remarks would give offense to his fellow Croatian Serbs and turn them away from his secessionist policies. As a consequence, however, the comparably moderate Rašković was replaced by Serb radicals, which hastened the start of the war in Croatia. Letica and Tuđman parted ways in March 1991 due to disagreement about Croatian politics towards Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nIn the following years Letica continued to appear in the Croatian media as a commentator, espousing opposition views, and became a regular columnist for \"Globus\", a popular news magazine. During his time at \"Globus\" he gained some notoriety due to an unsigned 1992 opinion piece (which he eventually admitted to have written), titled \"Croatian Feminists are Raping Croatia\", in which he attacked five Croatian feminist writers (Slavenka Drakulić, Vesna Kesić, Jelena Lovrić, Dubravka Ugrešić and Rada Iveković), accusing them of betraying Croatia. The article was a source of significant controversy which ultimately resulted in a successful defamation lawsuit against the magazine.\n\nIn the 2000 Croatian presidential election, Letica ran as an independent candidate. Although he finished fourth, the relatively high percentage of votes he won (4.14%) made him desirable to the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), a right-wing party in desperate need to tone down its negative far-right image. Letica, with his reputation of a refined urbanite and European intellectual, served this purpose very well and on the 2003 Croatian parliamentary election, as a candidate on HSP's list, won a seat in the Sabor (Croatian Parliament).\n\nHe also associated at one point with the Croatian True Revival, a one-time political project of Miroslav Tuđman and Nenad Ivanković that failed to gain major traction in Croatian politics.\n\nThe HSP nevertheless used Letica again as their candidate in the 2005 Croatian presidential election. When Letica won fewer votes than in 2000, 2.59%, he accused the HSP of not supporting him enough. He quit the party midway through his term and remained in the Sabor until January 2008 as an independent.\n\nIn the 2007 Croatian parliamentary election, his independent list for the Zagreb region failed to gain the five percent of the vote needed to enter the Parliament.\n\nLetica is married to Gordana Cerjan-Letica, a sociologist and a professor at the School of Dental Medicine, University of Zagreb. They have two sons, Bartol (born 1976) and Frane (born 1982).\n\nSelected books:\n"}

The reservoir is fed by the Angelina River, the major tributary of the Neches River. The Reservoir is upstream of the Big Thicket National Preserve.\n\nThe reservoir's capacity is , and is the largest lake wholly within the state of Texas. The reservoir is operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth district.\n\nConstruction began September 7, 1956, and the reservoir began serving its purpose on March 29, 1965. The main purposes of the reservoir are flood control, hydroelectric power generation, and conservation of water. Construction costs, including those for recreation facilities, were estimated at about $66 million.\n\nIt was known as McGee Bend Dam and Reservoir until 1963. In September of that year, the 88th Congress adopted a special resolution changing the name to \"Sam Rayburn Dam and Reservoir\" in honor of the recently deceased Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn, a long-time champion of soil and water conservation. Dedication ceremonies were held on May 8, 1965.\n\nIn accordance with the 1945 federal Rivers and Harbors Act, four reservoirs were originally approved for the Neches and Angelina Rivers Basin. They were designated as Dam A, Dam B, Rockland, and McGee Bend. The first to be built was Dam B, completed on the Neches River in 1953. The name was changed to Town Bluff Dam and B. A. Steinhagen Reservoir, but locals still refer to it as Dam B. In 1955, Congress approved the funding for McGee Bend Dam and Reservoir, and construction began in 1957. Congress changed the name to Sam Rayburn Dam and Reservoir in 1963, and it was formally dedicated in 1965. The Dam A and Rockland dams, which were to be on the Neches River upstream from the convergence of the Neches and Angelina Rivers, were deemed to be unnecessary and listed as \"deferred\".\n\nLake Sam Rayburn can be crossed on Texas State Highway 147 and is a popular recreation destination, both for boating and fishing, with game fish species in the lake including largemouth bass, bluegill, and channel catfish. Due to the abundance of bass, it is home to more than 300 tournaments annually, which include tournaments such as ESPN/BASS Masters, BASS Champs, Wal Mart BFL, FLW Outdoors, the Cabela's Texas Team Trail, Angler's Quest, Bass-n-Bucks, and McDonald's Big Bass Splash. In 2018, Lake Sam Rayburn was ranked number one by \"Bassmaster\" magazine for being the best bass lake in the nation.\n\nThe science-fiction and fantasy writer Ardath Mayhar lived near Sam Rayburn Lake, on a homestead bordering the Attoyac River above the lake.

It began operation on October 1, 1971 as one of Walt Disney World Resort's first two on-site hotels. The resort has a South Seas theme, and originally opened with 492 rooms. It was designed by Welton Becket and Associates and constructed by US Steel Realty Development. The resort is owned and operated by Disney Parks, Experiences and Products.\n\nSince its opening in 1971, the resort has seen three major expansions; the first in 1978, with the addition of a longhouse, the Tangaroa Terrace restaurant/support facility, and a secondary pool. A second expansion took place in 1985, with the construction of two additional longhouses. In that same year, the resort adopted the shortened name \"Disney's Polynesian Resort\". On May 2, 2014, it was announced that the resort would revert to the Disney's Polynesian Village Resort title while expanding further to include Disney Vacation Club accommodations as well as enhanced resort amenities. On April 1, 2015, the third expansion officially opened, including the new DVC additions and other amenities around the resort.\n\nDisney's Polynesian Village Resort is situated on the southern shore of the manmade Seven Seas Lagoon, south of Magic Kingdom and adjacent to other Walt Disney World complexes, with the Transportation and Ticket Center to the east and Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa to the west. The resort is on the Magic Kingdom monorail loop, providing transportation to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot (via transfer), and is part of the route for Disney's Magic Kingdom Resorts Water Launch service. Other Walt Disney World Resort theme parks and attractions are served by Disney Transport buses.\n\nThe resort is organized around a central building named the \"Great Ceremonial House\", itself designed after a Tahitian royal assembly lodge. The Great Ceremonial House houses guest services and most of the resort's dining and merchandise locations. From its opening until 2014, the Great Ceremonial House also featured an expansive tropical waterfall feature in its atrium, with over 75 species of plant life. The waterfall and foliage were removed and replaced, however, during extensive resort renovations due to health and safety concerns and to reimagine the lobby as a social space. No rooms are contained in this building, instead several lodges - \"longhouses\" - and water bungalows house all guest rooms and are spread out amongst resort property.\n\nAs of 2008, Disney's Polynesian Village Resort is certified green lodging property with the state of Florida.\n\nThe resort used United States Steel's then newly developed construction process for its original longhouses; steel frames were erected on-site, and pre-constructed modular rooms were lifted into these frames via crane, similar to Disney's Contemporary Resort. This method of building caused problems in both Disney's Polynesian and Contemporary Resorts, with guest complaints of a moldy smell in their rooms. It was found that mold and debris had collected in the spaces between each room. The spaces were filled in, stopping the problem, and Longhouses built as part of the resort's later expansions were built using conventional building techniques.\n\nWith newly found construction photos of the Polynesian Resort found, the rooms were done differently than the Contemporary. The Polynesian Resort, the Contemporary Resort, and the Court of Flags Resort all had the rooms built off site. The difference was instead of sliding the rooms into a metal frame like the Contemporary, they stacked the rooms and built the frame/concrete around them. Actual construction photos showing the stacking system\n\nThe resort design and layout consists of 11 two and three story longhouses, spread throughout the property. The resort originally opened with 484 guest rooms in 8 longhouses, Bali Hai, Bora Bora, Fiji, Hawaii, Maui, Samoa, Tahiti and Tonga. In 1978, the Oahu longhouse was added. The Moorea and Pago Pago longhouses were added in 1985. Between 2013 and 2015, 20 over-the-water DVC bungalows were constructed in a new area named Bora Bora.\n\nOn October 28, 1999, most of the resort's longhouses were renamed. Today the longhouses are named for islands on the Polynesian isle map, with chosen longhouse names matching the relative geographic position of their namesake island(s). Ten of the eleven longhouses, excluding Fiji, were renamed: Bali Hai became Tonga; Bora Bora became Niue; Hawaii became Samoa; Maui became Rarotonga; Moorea became Tahiti; Oahu became Tokelau; Pago Pago became Rapa Nui; Samoa became Tuvalu; Tahiti became Aotearoa and Tonga became Hawaii. The 2013-15 resort reimagining has returned the original names of the DVC longhouses. \n\nTwo of the current longhouses, Hawaii (formerly Tonga) and Tonga (formerly Bali Hai), offer a Concierge Lounge - where refreshments, views, and lounge space are offered exclusively to guests of Hawaii or Tonga.\n\nThe resort offers several shopping areas focused on Disney parks merchandise, resort-specific specialty merchandise, and convenience items, located in the Great Ceremonial House. BouTiki is located off the main lobby, with Moana Mercantile located opposite Kona Cafe on the second floor. Trader Sam's Grog Grotto also offers a limited range of merchandise.\n\nOn September 17, 2013 Disney Vacation Club announced that its next planned location would be at Disney’s Polynesian Village Resort. The first phase of DVC expansion to the resort opened April 1, 2015, adding 20 over-the-water 'Bora Bora' Bungalows and converting 2 existing buildings (Moorea (formerly Tahiti), Pago Pago (formerly Rapa Nui)) into Deluxe Studios. The Tokelau conversion was completed mid-2015 creating a total of 360 Deluxe Studios between the 3 buildings. Between the three DVC longhouses is a barbecue area for the use of resort guests, with two gas barbecues. In addition there will be 5 new rooms added between the Moorea, Tokelau and Pago Pago vacation club buildings.\n\n John Lennon signed the paperwork that officially broke up The Beatles at the Polynesian Resort on December 29, 1974.\n"}

The brigade was the First Brigade in the First Corps of the Army of the Potomac, and Colonel Walter Phelps and the regiments of the brigade referred to themselves as the Iron Brigade of the East and served with the Division's more famous Fourth Brigade which would earn the title \"Iron Brigade of the West\" in September 1862 during Battle of South Mountain in the Maryland Campaign.\n\nColonel Walter Phelps was chosen as the original commander of the regiment, and after his promotion to brigade commander, Major John McKie became regimental commander. The regiment suffered its first fatality when passing through Baltimore, when a man was killed by friendly fire during confusion among a mob.

{"id": "2005590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2005590", "title": "Southwest Conference", "text": "Southwest Conference\n\nThe Southwest Conference (SWC) was an NCAA Division I college athletic conference in the United States that existed from 1914 to 1996. Composed primarily of schools from Texas, at various times the conference included schools from Oklahoma and Arkansas as well, but not from the actual Southwestern United States.\n\nFor most of its history, the core members of the conference were Texas-based schools plus one in Arkansas: Rice University, Southern Methodist University, Texas A&M University, Texas Christian University, Baylor University, the University of Arkansas, University of Texas and Texas Tech University. After a long period of stability, the conference's overall athletic prowess began to decline throughout the 1980s, due in part to numerous member schools violating NCAA recruiting rules, culminating in the suspension of the entire SMU football program (\"death penalty\") for the 1987 and 1988 seasons. Arkansas, after years of feeling like an outsider in the conference, left after the 1990–91 school year to join the Southeastern Conference, although they did compete in the SWC in football for the 1991 season. Five years later, the conference precipitously broke up as Baylor, Texas, Texas A&M, and Texas Tech (which had entered in 1956) combined with the members of the former Big Eight Conference to form a new league, the Big 12 Conference, while Rice, SMU, TCU, and Houston (which entered the SWC in 1976) found homes in less prominent conferences (although TCU later joined the Big 12).\n\nL. Theo Bellmont, the University of Texas athletic director sent out questionnaires to schools in Texas and neighboring states to gauge their interest in organizing an athletic conference. By March 1, 1914 a number of schools had responded favorably to the idea.\n\nThe first organizational meeting of the conference was set for April 30, 1914; since not all schools involved could send representatives to attend that date, it was ultimately held on May 5 and 7, 1914 at the Oriental Hotel in Dallas, Texas. It was chaired by Bellmont, who originally wanted Louisiana State University and the University of Mississippi to join the conference as well, but they declined to do so. The Southwest Intercollegiate Athletic Conference became an official body on December 8, 1914, at a formal meeting at the Rice Hotel in Houston.\n\nIts early years saw fluctuation in membership; Southwestern (a comparatively smaller school) dropped out of the conference in 1916, and Southern Methodist University (SMU) joined in 1918, while Texas Christian University (TCU) became a member in 1923. Rice University left the conference in 1916, only to rejoin in 1918.\n\nPhillips University was a conference member for one year (1920). Oklahoma left in 1919 to join the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (later known as the Big Eight Conference), and was followed by Oklahoma A&M in 1925. However, the series between Texas and Oklahoma would continue as a non-conference matchup in the annual Red River Rivalry game held in Dallas. From 1925 until 1991, the University of Arkansas would be the only conference member not located within the state of Texas.\n\nBy 1925, the conference's name was shortened to simply Southwest Conference. After its organizational years, the conference settled into regularly scheduled meetings among its members, and began to gain stature nationwide. The SWC would be guided by seven commissioners, the first of whom, P. W. St. Clair, was appointed in 1938. In 1940, the conference took control of the then five-year-old Cotton Bowl Classic, which further established the prestige of both the bowl and the conference. Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech University) joined the SWC in 1958, followed by the University of Houston for the 1976 season (Houston won the SWC football championship in its first season in the league).\n\nThe two glory periods of the conference were in the 1930s and 1960s. In 1935, the last year before the AP Poll, both TCU and SMU claimed the national title. The 2 teams had played in one the first games labeled \"game of the century\" on November 30 of that year. In 1938, TCU won the AP national title. In 1939, the SWC made it back to back national titles when Texas A&M won the AP Poll. In the 1960s, the SWC was dominated by two teams, Texas and Arkansas. Texas won the 1963 national championship, and Arkansas won a national championship in 1964 in the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) and Helms Athletic Foundation (HAF) polls. In 1969, Texas won another national championship by beating #2-ranked Arkansas 15-14 in the regular season's final game (dubbed the \"Big Shootout\"). The 1969 Arkansas–Texas game in Fayetteville, Arkansas, attended by President Richard Nixon, is usually counted among the greatest college football games ever played. Texas also won the 1970 United Press International (UPI) National Championship (i.e., the coaches' poll), which until 1974 was awarded prior to the bowl games. Texas lost the Cotton Bowl Classic following the 1970 season to Notre Dame by a score of 24–11, giving the Associated Press (AP) Championship to Nebraska after they beat LSU by a score of 17–12 in the Orange Bowl.\n\nSince its first Cotton Bowl Classic and lasting until 1995, the Southwest Conference Champion automatically received an invitation as the \"host\" team in the Cotton Bowl Classic game on New Year's Day in Dallas. Opponents usually were the runners-up from the Big Eight Conference or the Southeastern Conference, although independents Penn State and Notre Dame were also often featured. From the 1940s onward, the Cotton Bowl Classic was counted among the four major bowl games, and often had national championship implications. However, in the 1990s, the game declined in importance, largely because of the decline of SWC prominence. In 1977, Notre Dame became the last team to win a national championship in the Cotton Bowl Classic by beating Texas in the January 1978 game.\n\nThe SWC had many legendary players and coaches over the years. In football, John Heisman, Dana X. Bible, Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, Darrell Royal, Frank Broyles, Hayden Fry, Lou Holtz, Bill Yeoman, Gene Stallings, and Grant Teaff all served as head coaches in the conference. Some notable SWC players included Davey O'Brien, Sammy Baugh, Bobby Layne, Doak Walker, Tom Landry, Bob Lilly, Don Meredith, Earl Campbell, Andre Ware, Mike Singletary, John David Crow, Lance Alworth, Dan Hampton, Steve Atwater, Joe Ferguson, and Eric Dickerson. The trio of kicking contemporaries Steve Little of Arkansas, Tony Franklin of Texas A&M, and Russell Erxleben of Texas all kicked record setting field goals of 60 + yards in the same season.\n\nThe early 1980s were the glory years of SWC basketball, including the \"Phi Slama Jama\" teams at the University of Houston. However, the most consistent program during the last quarter of the 20th century was the University of Arkansas with Sweet 16 appearances in 1978, 1979, 1981, 1983, 1990, 1991, Elite 8 appearances in 1978, 1979, 1990 and 1991 and Final Four appearances in 1978 and 1990. Arkansas's famed Triplets, Marvin Delph, Ron Brewer and Sidney Moncrief, gave the rest of the league fits. Furthermore, the Razorbacks' Lee Mayberry, Todd Day and Oliver Miller won three straight SWC regular season and tournament titles from 1989–1991, the school's last three seasons in the conference. The passion of Arkansas fans for their Razorbacks often overran the confines of SWC basketball venues, so much so, that Reunion Arena in Dallas (annual site of the SWC postseason tournament) was deemed \"Barnhill South\" (after the Razorbacks' on-campus arena) based on the numbers and intensity of Hog fans present.\n\nOutstanding basketball coaches included Nolan Richardson, Tom Penders, Eddie Sutton, Abe Lemons, Guy V. Lewis, Shelby Metcalf and Gerald Myers. Great SWC hoops players included the aforementioned \"Triplets\", Akeem Olajuwon, Clyde Drexler, Vinnie Johnson, Jon Koncak, Alvin Robertson, Ricky Pierce, Darrell Walker, Joe Kleine, Day, Mayberry, Miller and U.S. Reed, among others.\n\nThe Texas Longhorns baseball program under coach Cliff Gustafson won national titles in 1975 and 1983, as well as titles under Bibb Falk in 1949 and 1950. The Arkansas Razorbacks also fielded fine teams that advanced to the College World Series. The Hogs finished 2nd in 1979, 3rd in 1985 and 5th in both the 1987 and 1989 seasons. The Hogs have continued this tradition since moving to the SEC, reaching the CWS four times under Arkansas alumnus Dave Van Horn, and were the 2018 national runners-up. Texas A&M rose to power in the late 1980s, going 58-5 in 1989 before losing twice in the regional championship round on its home field to LSU. The Aggies reached the College World Series in 1993. Rice began its ascent to college baseball's elite in the conference's final years under coach Wayne Graham, reaching the CWS in 1997, the year after the conference disbanded.\n\nThe Arkansas Razorbacks were dominant in track and field winning 15 SWC cross country team titles, 11 SWC indoor track team titles, 9 SWC outdoor track team titles and an incredible 8 SWC triple crowns (cross country, indoor track and outdoor track champions all in the same season). During their SWC days, the Razorbacks won 14 NCAA national team championships and one NCAA team triple crown. The list of Arkansas individual SWC champions and individual NCAA champions is long. Standout coaches and athletes include the legendary John McDonnell of Arkansas, the winningest coach in NCAA history regardless of sport. Baylor's Michael Johnson, Texas A&M's Randy Matson, Rice's Fred Hansen, Houston's Carl Lewis and Arkansas' Mike Conley all went on to win Olympic gold medals.\n\nThe 1980s saw many of the conference's athletic programs hit by recruiting scandals and NCAA probations. The only programs to escape probation in the 1980s were Arkansas, Baylor, and Rice. Because of repeated major violations, in 1987, the SMU Mustangs football program became only the third in NCAA history to receive the so-called \"Death Penalty\" (after Kentucky basketball in 1952–53 and Southwestern Louisiana basketball from 1973 to 1975). The NCAA canceled SMU's 1987 season, and limited it to seven road games for 1988. However, nearly all of the school's lettermen transferred elsewhere, forcing SMU to keep its football program shuttered for 1988 as well. SMU also remained on probation until 1990. At that time, NCAA rules prohibited schools on probation from appearing on live television. As a result, the conference's market share in television coverage dwindled.\n\nThe SWC's performance in football declined precipitously. The last SWC football champion to win a bowl game was Texas A&M, who beat Notre Dame in the 1988 Cotton Bowl Classic by a score of 35-10. Since then, the final eight SWC champions lost in their bowl games. After SMU's second-place finish in most polls in 1982, SWC programs usually were not serious contenders for the national title. Texas had strong teams in 1981, 1983, 1990, and 1995. Arkansas had strong teams in 1988 and 1989, and Texas A&M was strong from 1985 to 1995, but by the end of their respective seasons none were able to remain in the national championship hunt.\n\nOn June 27, 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in \"NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma\" that the NCAA could not punish its membership for selling their media content. As a result, individual schools and athletic conferences were freed to negotiate contracts on their own behalf.\n\nThe Big Ten and Pacific-10 conferences sold their rights to ABC. Most of the rest of the Division I-A football programs (what is now called the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision) chose to sell their rights together through an organization called the College Football Association to ABC and CBS. The primary function of the CFA was to negotiate television broadcast rights for its member conferences and independent colleges.\n\nBy 1990, the television landscape had changed and a number of the stronger programs saw opportunities for better deals outside of the CFA. Notre Dame left the CFA and sold their home game broadcast rights to NBC.\n\nWhen the Southeastern Conference invited the University of Arkansas and the University of South Carolina to join the conference in 1990, it created shockwaves across the CFA. The other conferences in the CFA correctly assumed the SEC made these additions to create a better TV product with the idea of leaving the CFA.\n\nThe SEC represented one of the more valuable assets in the CFA. It seemed likely if the SEC departed, the other conferences could have quite a difficult time securing good TV deals.\n\nIn February 1994, the Southeastern Conference announced that they would be leaving the CFA and negotiate independently for a television deal that covered SEC schools only. This led \"The Dallas Morning News\" to proclaim that \"the College Football Association as a television entity is dead\". In 1995, the SEC and the Big East broke from the CFA, signing a national deal with CBS. The SEC would earn a staggering $95 million from the deal. More significantly, this change in television contracts ultimately would lead to significant realignment of college conferences.\n\nIn 1990, Arkansas announced its departure for the Southeastern Conference, marking the beginning of the end for the Southwest Conference. In March 1994, Texas, Texas A&M, Baylor, and Texas Tech accepted invitations to join with the members of the Big Eight Conference to form the Big 12 Conference. Soon afterward, SMU, TCU, and Rice accepted invitations to join the Western Athletic Conference, while Houston became a charter member of Conference USA. In May 1996, after the completion of championship matches in baseball and track & field, the Southwest Conference was officially dissolved.\n\nOver the course of its 82-year history, teams of the Southwest Conference garnered 64 recognized national championships in collegiate sports.\n\nIn 1997, the official records of the conference from 1914 to 1996 were moved from Dallas to the campus of Texas Tech University, becoming part of the Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library. The archive also contains an extensive assortment of images and memorabilia from each member university.\n\n\nNote: Houston was invited to join the SWC in March 1971, and began play in all sports except football and basketball in 1972–73. Cougar basketball joined the fray in 1975–76, and football was last to join for the 1976–77 school year.\n\n\nThis is a listing of the conference facilities as of the last year of the conference 1995–1996.\nPresident John F. Kennedy alluded to the Southwest Conference with the question, \"\"Why does Rice play Texas?\"\" in his September 12, 1962, \"We choose to go to the Moon\" speech delivered at Rice Stadium.\n\nIn a December 1982 episode of the soap opera \"Dallas\", the character Bobby Ewing (played by Patrick Duffy) said he had been \"All-Southwest Conference\" in football.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2005593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2005593", "title": "The Escapist (magazine)", "text": "The Escapist (magazine)\n\nThe Escapist (formerly known as Escapist Magazine) is an American video game website and online magazine. First published as a weekly online magazine by Themis Media on July 12, 2005, \"The Escapist\" eventually pivoted to a traditional web journalism format and became well-known for a roster of popular video series.\n\nIn 2018, \"Escapist Magazine\" launched Volume Two, a rehauled website in conjunction with its purchase by Enthusiast Gaming, which also owns Destructoid. The site name reverted back to \"The Escapist\" in April 2020.\n\n\"The Escapist\" was conceived as a PDF-format magazine by Themis Media, whose president Alexander Macris had previously found success with its sister site WarCry Network. Editor-in-chief Julianne Greer had not been involved in the gaming industry before \"The Escapist\", and had a background in marketing and new media.\n\nThe premier issue featured pieces from well-known gaming-community authors including Jerry Holkins, Kieron Gillen, and John Scott Tynes. Following issues included work by Tom Chick, Allen Varney, Jim Rossignol and other top writers from in and outside the game industry, including a four-part piece by leading game designer Warren Spector. According to Themis, by late 2006 the website had 150,000 monthly readers. The website MMORPG.com noted that the webzine had become the \"flagship brand\" for Themis, which runs other websites and ventures related to the gaming industry, with the reputation of \"a widely read and highly respected form of game journalism\" and \"paying writers top dollar\".\n\nOn July 9, 2007, the site relaunched with a completely new design, which also saw the end of the weekly PDF issues and a shift in layout to one more similar to other websites. Although the weekly topic and publish schedule was retained, new regular content additions included more game reviews, editorial articles, conference coverage, and a relaunch of Shoot Club by Tom Chick.\n\nThe most notable addition to the content lineup was \"Zero Punctuation\", a weekly animated review series that led to a four-fold increase in web traffic. Within the next four years, \"The Escapist\" contracted several creators including LoadingReadyRun, Miracle of Sound, and Bob \"MovieBob\" Chipman, as well as helping launch \"Extra Credits\" as a rebrand of its creators' videos.\n\nIn 2010, \"The Escapist\" launched a membership service called the Publisher's Club which for $20 a year removed advertisements from the site, conferred forum benefits and entry into special contests.\n\nAround the end of July 2011, there was a dispute between \"The Escapist\" and James Portnow, the producer of \"Extra Credits\". After not being paid for months, the \"Extra Credits\" team needed to pay for surgery for their artist, Allison Theus. They began a charity fund on RocketHub, separate from \"The Escapist\", and received substantially more money than was necessary for Theus's surgery. They planned to use this extra money to create a game publishing label, where the revenue would go directly into funding subsequent projects. Alexander Macris, owner and co-founder of The Escapist, stated the money should have been used to create more episodes of \"Extra Credits\" for \"The Escapist\" and to compensate Themis Media for donation incentives, such as premium memberships and T-shirts.\n\nDuring the dispute, a number of other contracted creators spoke out in support of \"Extra Credits\", relaying similar stories of mistreatment by the management. Among them were MovieBob, LoadingReadyRun, and the creators of \"No Right Answer\". Later, those creators would also break ties with \"The Escapist\", leaving Yahtzee as the sole contracted creator by 2017. As a result, \"Extra Credits\" broke ties with \"The Escapist\", moving to Penny Arcade and later becoming independent.\n\nMacris would later become involved with the sale of Themis Media to Alloy Digital, as well as supporting the Gamergate controversy in 2014 by openly adopting stricter policies.\n\nOn November 15, 2012, it was announced that Themis Media had been acquired by Alloy Digital for an undisclosed sum. For a few years afterwards, Alloy cross-promoted Smosh Games on \"The Escapist\". In 2014, Alloy Digital merged with Break Media to form Defy Media, with a consolidated portfolio that did not mention \"The Escapist\".\n\nOn January 21, 2015, Defy Media announced it was cutting staff across a portfolio of its main sites including The Escapist, GameTrailers and GameFront. In 2016, The Escapist laid off a 'number of employees' and shuttered its main office in Durham, North Carolina leaving the website's main operation out of Seattle.\n\nIn July 2018, \"The Escapist\" was purchased by Enthusiast Gaming, owner of Destructoid, and a relaunch was announced with editor-in-chief Russ Pitts at the helm, which came into effect September 2018 and the website name changed to \"Escapist Magazine Volume Two\". \"The Big Picture\", produced by MovieBob, was the first series to be officially relaunched alongside the continued \"Zero Punctuation\". Following a Twitter exchange with Zoë Quinn over a now-deleted article about Gamergate, Russ Pitts announced he would be taking a \"voluntary leave of absence\" from \"The Escapist\" in February 2019. Nick Calandra, who joined the site in 2019 as the Managing Director of Video, replaced Pitts as Editor-in-Chief in July 2019.\n\nIn April 2020, the site name reverted back to \"The Escapist\". The site also launched \"The Escapist +\", which allows readers to view the site without advertisements.\n\n\"The Escapist\" has hosted a number of ongoing video series and webcomics, most of which pertain to video games, although they have expanded to other aspects of geek culture. Note: time postings are in EST.\n\n\"Zero Punctuation\" is a weekly video game review series created by Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw. In the show, Yahtzee plays an animated caricature of himself who doesn't stop speaking for any punctuation, hence the name of the series.\n\n\"The Big Picture\" is a general media discussion series hosted by Bob \"MovieBob\" Chipman and is the first show to be revived since the website was acquired by Enthusiast Gaming.\n\n\"Escape to the Movies\" is a film review series hosted by Chipman. It was previously cancelled with Chipman's departure in 2015, and was revived in November 2018 alongside his film reviewer presence on Geek.com.\n\nGameumentary was founded in January 2017 by Nick Calandra and acquired by \"Escapist\"s parent company Enthusiast Gaming in October 2018. All Gameumentary content was moved under \"Escapist\" in July 2019 after Calandra's promotion to Managing Editor of Video.\n\n\n\"March Mayhem: Developer's Showdown\" (commonly referred to as \"March Mayhem\" or simply \"MM\") is an annual event hosted by \"The Escapist\" to determine the most popular video game developer in the industry. The event was first introduced in 2008 and takes the form of a series of opinion polls, split into four divisions (North, South, East and West) each consisting of 16 developers. In each round, developers are eliminated down to two, who then compete in the grand final.\n\nThe event was criticised by many site members due to the site's policy of allowing developers to advertise on their own websites and games in order to gain votes. Further criticism ensued in 2010 when \"Zynga\" was permitted to enter the competition despite multiple controversies surrounding the business practices of the company and debates whether Facebook applications could be considered games. There was also significant controversy over the 2011 result, considering winner Mojang hadn't officially released a game as of March 2011. As a result of this criticism and a generally negative opinion of the contest by Escapist users, March Mayhem did not take place in 2013, but was then revived in 2014 in much the same format, albeit with greater community input in the initial 16 developers chosen.\n\nIn May 2008, \"The Escapist\" won the Webby Award and 2008 People's Choice Award for Best Video-Game Related Website. \"The Escapist\" also won this award in 2009 after a protracted voting battle between the members of \"The Escapist\" and the website GameSpot. In 2011 \"The Escapist\" again won three Webby Awards: Best Games-Related Website, People's Voice Best Games-Related Website and People's Voice Best Lifestyle Website. \"The Escapist\" also received a Mashable Open Web Award for Best Online Magazine in 2009 and was named one of the 50 Best Websites by \"Time\" magazine in 2011.\n"}
{"id": "2005601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2005601", "title": "Enterochromaffin cell", "text": "Enterochromaffin cell\n\nEnterochromaffin (EC) cells (also known as Kulchitsky cells) are a type of enteroendocrine cell, and neuroendocrine cell. They reside alongside the epithelium lining the lumen of the digestive tract and play a crucial role in gastrointestinal regulation, particularly intestinal motility and secretion. They were discovered by Nikolai Kulchitsky. \n\nEC cells modulate neuron signalling in the enteric nervous system (ENS) via the secretion of the neurotransmitter serotonin and other peptides. As enteric afferent and efferent nerves do not protrude into the intestinal lumen, EC cells act as a form of sensory transduction. Serotonin in the ENS acts in synergy with other digestive hormones to regulate sensory and motor gastrointestinal reflexes. EC cells respond to both chemical and neurological stimuli. They are also reactive to mechanosensation, which is the case in the peristaltic reflex of the gut, and can be stimulated by a bolus moving through the bowel. Upon activation, EC cells release serotonin to act upon serotonin receptors on ENS neurons. Dependent on concentration, serotonin can then modulate peristaltic contraction and secretion through activation of smooth muscle and glands, respectively.\n\nPulmonary neuroendocrine cells in the respiratory tract are known as \"bronchial Kulchitsky cells\".\n\nEC cells are small polygonal cells located in the crypts between intestinal villi. They are discriminated from other cells of the gastrointestinal epithelial crypts by the presence of basally located granulations that contain serotonin and other peptides. Ultrastructurally, these granules are reported to vary in size and shape and are considered pleomorphic.\n\nMost EC cells communicate with the lumen of intestinal crypts through apical microvilli (protrusions) and are referred to as “open”. A proportion of EC cells do not protrude into the crypt lumen and are subsequently referred to as ‘closed’. EC cells typically extend down to the basal lamina with cytoplasmic extensions known to pass through the connective tissue and neighbouring glands. Tissue beneath EC cells typically contains abundant fenestrated capillaries, lymph vessels and small unmyelinated nerve fibres. Secreted serotonin can either be taken up into residing vessels (transported in the blood by platelets) or act on nerve synaptic terminals.\n\nEC cells are found aggregated in specific locations throughout the gastrointestinal tract, predominantly in the small intestine, colon and appendix. The proportion of high-density cell populations varies between species attributed to differences in dietary requirements and physiological characteristics.\n\n“Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells” are a population of cells that are found in the gastric pits of the stomach luminal epithelium and secrete histamine. In response to gastrin released by neighbouring G-cells, secreted histamine from ECL cells acts on parietal cells to stimulate the release of gastric acid. The presence of ECL cells is critical in regulation of endocrine-induced gastric acid secretion. ECL cells histologically appear similar to EC cells and are hence named as such. They are however a different cell type and do not possess any serotonin synthesizing mechanisms.\n\nIn developing chick embryos, EC cells have been found in biopsies of developing GIT tissue before the migration of neural crest cells. Whilst EC cells have neuroendocrine properties and are similar chemically and histologically to cells of the adrenal medulla they are not derivatives of the neural crest and do not share a similar cell progenitor. EC cells are believed to be derived from endodermal origins and are descended from the stem cells that form other epithelial cell types of the gastrointestinal lumen.\n\nThe primary function of EC cells is to synthesise and secrete serotonin for modulation of gastrointestinal neurons. Serotonin, also named 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT), can be classified as a hormone, neurotransmitter and a mitogen. It is primarily known for its role in the central nervous system but plays an important role in the periphery, with the largest endogenous pool of serotonin residing in the gut (90% of endogenous store). In the ENS, serotonin is an essential modulator of sensory transduction and mucus secretion. Release of serotonin from EC cells can be triggered by a multitude of stimuli, particularly luminal distension, parasympathetic innervation or changes in osmotic concentrations in intestinal contents.\n\nThe synthesis of 5-HT, in EC cells, is catalyzed by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TpH1) from the amino acid L-tryptophan. The reaction proceeds in two stages with an initial rate limiting step involving the conversion of L-tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). Following conversion to 5-HTP, the non-rate limiting L-amino acid decarboxylase converts 5-HTP to 5-HT by decarboxylation. Following synthesis, 5-HT is then stored in vesicles by vesicular monoamine transporter 1 close to the basal margin of the cell for eventual secretion.\n\nRelease of the vesicles occurs after chemical, neurological or mechanical stimulation of the EC cells and is predominantly calcium dependent, suggesting excretion via exocytosis. The combined effect of increased calcium flux and a liberation of stored calcium within the cell changes the cell potential triggering release of the 5-HT vesicles. The vesicles pass from the basal margin into the surrounding lamina propria for interaction with nearby nerve synapses, lymph and blood vessels.\n\nThe serotonin synthesised by EC cells is predominately exocytosed from the basal border, but is also known to be apically secreted into the lumen of the gut and can be present in faecal samples. Secreted 5-HT acts on different receptor subtypes found localised in cells in the gastrointestinal epithelium, smooth muscle and connective tissue with responsiveness dependent on the concentration of the secreted hormone.\n\nThe primary effect of serotonin involves the increase in peristaltic contraction through its effects on both ENS neurons and smooth muscle. 5-HT also activates a neural secretory response, whereby binding at 5-HT1P receptors on myenteric neurons triggers a signalling cascade in the submucosal plexus. This results in the release of acetylcholine to initiate secretion from the gut mucosa via release of chloride ions.\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a diverse condition associated with chronic bowel discomfort and abdominal pain that ranges in severity between patients. Abnormal concentrations of serotonin have been associated with IBS, predominantly increased concentrations intensifying gastrointestinal motility and mucosal secretions from the gut mucosa. \nSevere IBS often manifests as either chronic constipation or chronic diarrhoea, and abnormal EC cell populations have been correlated with both conditions. In patients suffering post-infectious IBS, rectal biopsies have shown a dramatic increase in populations of EC cells associated with diarrhoeal symptoms.\n\nLikewise, reduced populations of EC cells in patients suffering chronic constipation have been observed, indicating a lack of 5-HT, and therefore decreased GI motility and secretion. Ongoing research indicates that abnormal EC cell populations, and therefore 5-HT signalling, may significantly contribute to gastrointestinal dysfunction. Treatment using 5-HT-receptor agonists for patients with functional constipation have shown some effectiveness in achieving normal GI functionality.\n\nCarcinoid syndrome is a rare condition characterized by an abnormal increase in circulating biologically active hormones, largely serotonin, with early symptoms involving diarrhea, abdominal cramping and episodic flushing. Excess circulating serotonin is usually manufactured by EC-cell-originated carcinoid tumors in the small bowel or appendix. Tumors are slow growing, but can metastasise to the liver if aggressive. They can also be present at other sites, particularly the lung and stomach.\n\nThe name ‘enterochromaffin’ comes from the Greek word “enteron” (ἔντερον), in relation to intestines, and “chromaffin” as a grouping of the words chromium and affinity, as they can be visualised by staining with chromium salts. Similarly named, Chromaffin cells (of the adrenal medulla) share this characteristic and are histologically similar to EC cells. Their embryological origins, however, are quite different, nor do they possess similar functions.\n\n"}

It uses camshafts and poppet valves rather than the piston valves used in other valve gear. While basing his design on automotive valves, Caprotti made several significant departures from this design to adapt the valves for steam. Having agreed a joint-venture with Worcester-based engineering company Heenan & Froude from 1938, Heenan & Froude fully acquired Caprotti post-World War II in 1947.\n\nThe Caprotti valve gear was first tested on a Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane Class 740 2-8-0 mixed-traffic locomotive in 1921; although more expensive and complicated than the standard piston valves, it substantially improved the locomotive's performance. Until the 1930s it was fitted on some 334 FS locomotives and on 77 narrow-gauge locomotives of other companies; of the former, some were new-builds, the others were rebuilds of non-superheated compound locomotives.\n\nGiven their need for more complex and expensive maintenance, most of these locomotives were generally withdrawn from service before those with Walschaerts valve gear, in the 1960s.\n\nIn August 1926, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway equipped four-cylinder 4-6-0 locomotive no. 5908 of the \"Claughton\" Class with Caprotti valve gear and poppet valves. Following trials, nine more were rebuilt in 1928 with Caprotti valve gear, poppet valves and larger boilers, and also in 1928 ten others of the same class were given the larger boiler but retained the Walschaerts valve gear and piston valves with which this class was originally fitted, to enable comparisons to be made between the two types of valve gear. Later that year, no. 5908 was also given a larger boiler. It was found that the Caprotti-fitted locomotives were more economical on coal and water than those with Walschaerts valve gear, but it was later found that some of the losses of the Walschaerts locomotives was due to leakage of steam past the valve heads, where a single wide ring was used. New piston valves having several narrow rings were fitted to one locomotive, and it was then found that the Walschaerts valve gear could be just as economical as the Caprotti, but with considerably less cost of fitment. No more \"Claughtons\" were fitted with Caprotti valve gear, and the ten locomotives were withdrawn in 1935–36.\n\nOn the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), two 4-6-0 locomotives of LNER Class B3 were rebuilt with Caprotti valve gear in 1929, followed by a further two in 1938–39. These locomotives also had four cylinders, and the poppet valves were mounted vertically, two at each end of each cylinder. One of the first pair of locomotives was rebuilt with Walschaerts valve gear in 1943, but the other three ran with Caprotti valve gear until withdrawal in 1946–47.\n\nIn the 1950s, Caprotti valve gear was improved and this British Caprotti valve gear was fitted to the last two British Railways-built 'Black Fives' 44686/7, the last 30 BR standard class 5s, numbers 73125-54, and the unique BR standard class 8 71000 \"Duke of Gloucester\". Results were mixed, with the performance of the \"Duke of Gloucester\" being particularly disappointing. That was later found to be due to errors elsewhere in the design and construction of the locomotive.\n\nAlthough more expensive to manufacture than its rivals, the improved Caprotti valve gear is considerably more efficient than any other. A major improvement is that much of the mechanism is enclosed, leading to reduced wear and tear from the harsh steam locomotive environment, and completely independent control of admission and exhaust. The restored \"Duke of Gloucester\", with its flaws eliminated, has proved the concept.\n\n"}

The parkway was constructed in the mid-1960s.\n\nCabin John Parkway begins at a partial interchange with Clara Barton Parkway in the unincorporated area of Cabin John. The interchange allows access from southbound Cabin John Parkway to eastbound Clara Barton Parkway and from westbound Clara Barton Parkway to northbound Cabin John Parkway. Each direction of the parkway crosses Cabin John Creek before the roadways come together to pass under the Union Arch Bridge, which carries the Washington Aqueduct and MacArthur Boulevard. Cabin John Parkway crosses Cabin John Creek again before continuing north as a four-lane freeway with a speed limit of through a forested corridor paralleling the creek. After crossing Booze Creek, the two directions of the parkway divide toward their termini at I-495 (Capital Beltway) in Bethesda. The northbound direction of the Cabin John Parkway splits into single-lane ramps for northbound I-495 and I-495's interchange with MD 190 (River Road). The southbound parkway is formed by ramps from southbound I-495 and MD 190.\n\nCabin John Parkway is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration and has an internal designation of I-495X.

Cabin John Parkway is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial for its entire length.\n\nConstruction on Cabin John Parkway began in 1962 when I-495's bridge across Cabin John Creek and the southbound ramp to the parkway was built. Work on the remainder of the parkway was underway by 1963. Cabin John Parkway opened in 1965 when the Clara Barton Parkway (then known as the Maryland portion of the George Washington Parkway) from the Cabin John interchange east to the MacArthur Boulevard interchange opened.\n"}

The band's debut single \"2-4-6-8 Motorway\" was a top five hit on the UK Singles Chart in 1977, and their third single, \"Up Against the Wall\", is seen by some as a classic punk rock single; while their début album, \"Power in the Darkness\" (1978), is regarded as a definitive late Seventies punk album.\n\nTom Robinson began gigging in London in 1976. By the end of the year, he had decided to put together a permanent band. Robinson's old friend, guitarist Danny Kustow, was the first in the permanent lineup. They ran small ads in the music papers looking for a bass player and drummer. Robinson found drummer Brian \"Dolphin\" Taylor. \nThe search for a bass player continued, until Mark Ambler auditioned. Some days later, Ambler mentioned he also played keyboards; he had spent many years studying piano with veteran jazz musician, Stan Tracey. After listening to Ambler playing his Hammond organ Robinson realised he would have to be the bass player himself. \n\nThe band hit the club scene right in the middle of London's punk explosion. Their live shows got favourable reviews, and soon A&R men were attending many of their gigs.\n\nEMI Records signed the Tom Robinson Band (TRB). Robinson later described this period, saying \"Within nine months we'd made the transition from signing on at Medina Road dole office to \"Top of the Pops\", Radio One, EMI Records and the giddy heights of the front cover of the \"New Musical Express\"\".\n\nTRB made leaflets and fliers about their political views and sent them to everyone who attended their gigs. They gave away badges and made up T-shirts emblazoned with the band's logo and they appeared regularly at Rock Against Racism concerts. They were joined at these gigs by the likes of The Clash, Steel Pulse and X-Ray Spex.\n\n\"2-4-6-8 Motorway\" was their first single, released in late 1977, which got into the top five of the UK singles charts and stayed there for over a month. It was followed almost immediately by their next record, a four-song EP called \"Rising Free\", which was recorded live at London's Lyceum Theatre in November 1977. It contained the songs \"Don't Take No for an Answer\", \"Martin\", \"(Sing if You're) Glad to Be Gay\" and \"Right on Sister\". The EP reached No. 18 in the UK singles charts.\n\nIn early 1978, TRB recorded their debut album, \"Power in the Darkness\". The UK version of the LP contained all new songs, but in the US (on the Harvest label), the \"2-4-6-8 Motorway\" single and \"Rising Free\" record were combined for a six-track bonus EP that made the album almost a double.\n\n\"Power in the Darkness\" reached number 4 in the UK album charts and won the band a gold record, and TRB were voted \"Best New Band\" and \"Best London Band\" for the year 1977 by listeners at the Capital Radio Music Awards. Keyboardist Mark Ambler left the band after recording the first album. Session pianist Nick Plytas was drafted in as a temporary replacement, and played with TRB at a major Anti Nazi League rally in London's Victoria Park early that year. \n\nKeyboardist Ian Parker joined as a permanent replacement for Ambler. TRB then went to Rockfield Studios in Wales to record their next album, \"TRB Two\". Chris Thomas, who had produced their first album, was also at the control deck for their second album, to start off with. Drummer Dolphin Taylor suggested Todd Rundgren should replace Thomas. After not being able to decide which tracks should appear on the LP, the band eventually agreed to let Rundgren choose. However, he picked two of the songs Dolphin particularly disliked, and Taylor decided that he would leave rather than play on the tracks. A day later he had calmed down somewhat and offered to return, but Robinson refused, and Preston Heyman was recruited as an emergency stand-in. His picture was included on the album cover, but there was never any intention for him to join the band permanently. Taylor's eventual replacement was Charlie Morgan who had played for Kate Bush, and went on to drum for Elton John for a further fifteen years.\n\nTo support the album's release, the band went on tour, but by this point the TRB's infighting had taken its toll. When guitarist Kustow decided to quit in 1979 that was the end of TRB.\n\nIn 1989, Robinson, Kustow and Ambler put together a reunion tour and played sold out shows at the Marquee in London and went on for the best part of a year before splitting again.\n\nNotes:\n\n"}

{"id": "2005644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2005644", "title": "J. B. Morton", "text": "J. B. Morton\n\nJohn Cameron Andrieu Bingham Michael Morton, better known by his preferred abbreviation J. B. Morton (7 June 1893 – 10 May 1979) was an English humorous writer noted for authoring a column called \"By the Way\" under the pen name 'Beachcomber' in the \"Daily Express\" from 1924 to 1975.\n\nG. K. Chesterton described Morton as \"a huge thunderous wind of elemental and essential laughter\"; according to Evelyn Waugh, he had \"the greatest comic fertility of any Englishman\".\n\nMorton was born at Park Lodge, Mitcham Road, Tooting. He was an only child, and his father, Edward Morton, was a serious journalist and dramatic critic. He introduced Morton junior to (watered-down) wine before he went to school, and to the sons of his friend Leslie Stuart. His mother, Rosamond Bingham, died when he was 12.\n\nFrom the age of eight Morton attended Park House prep school in Southborough, London. In 1907 he moved on to Harrow School and hated it. Harrow later provided the inspiration for the fictional Narkover, a school full of theft, gambling, drinking, and corruption. Morton was admitted to Worcester College, Oxford but failed to win a scholarship, and had to leave after a year to support his father after a stroke.\n\nMorton did not have an outstanding academic career, and left Oxford wanting to be a poet. His talent as a poet proved to be limited.\n\nQuickly realising that he could not make a living from poetry, Morton found a job writing for a musical revue, until he was interrupted by the outbreak of war in 1914. He enlisted as a private in the Royal Fusiliers and was sent to the trenches the following year. The battalion was disbanded in 1916 and Morton was commissioned in the Suffolk Regiment. After fighting in the Somme he was sent home with shell shock and spent the rest of the war in the intelligence service.\n\nAfter the war, Morton wrote a novel, \"The Barber of Putney\", based on his experience of life in the trenches. It was published in 1919, and the same year, he started writing for the \"Sunday Express\" newspaper. He had a weekly column which he filled with random jokes and poems, and wrote occasional essays on cross-country walking—his favourite hobby. In 1922, he was moved over to the \"Daily Express\" as a reporter, but did not enjoy straight reporting. Morton later recalled, \"I remember being asked to interview the mother of a boy who'd killed someone. As I went along in the cab, I thought: 'D'you realise what you're doing?' Then I decided I couldn't go on.\"\n\nOn 7 July 1917, the \"By the Way\" column first appeared on the leader page of the \"Express\". Nothing shocking at first, it was 900 words of gossip and topical comment previously appearing under the header \"Gossip of the Day\". Major John Bernard Arbuthnot MVO started the new column and the 'Beachcomber' pseudonym that appeared a week later. In 1919, he was promoted to Assistant Editor, and D. B. Wyndham Lewis (the literary editor) took the column over. Like Morton, Wyndham-Lewis had also served in the ranks in the War, and the two shared a bizarre sense of humour, as well as being fellow Francophiles. Wyndham-Lewis set the surreal, comic style that was to become the column's identifying feature, and published the first collection of Beachcomber material in 1922, entitled \"A London Farrago\".\n\nWith so much in common, when Morton moved into his cubicle they quickly became friends, and their continual banter could be heard across the top floor of the building. Thus, when Wyndham Lewis moved to the \"Daily Mail\" in April 1924, Morton was the obvious person to continue the column. He gradually lightened the tone of the humour, and introduced a range of recurring characters. Morton published his first Beachcomber collection, \"Mr Thake\", in 1929, and 17 more collections followed over the next 30 years.\n\nEarly on, Morton wrote his column in the offices of the \"Express\", and was known for laughing out loud and dancing after finishing each paragraph. As a day's column never took more than a few hours, and he always wrote a week in advance, his afternoons were always free for socialising. In later years, he despatched the (hand-written) column by post from wherever he happened to be at the time.\n\nMorton viewed the Beachcomber sobriquet as a protective blanket of anonymity, and continued to enjoy this until his identity was revealed in the thirties. Drawings in the column depicted Beachcomber as a young woman, and the column was widely believed to be composed of many people's contributions. Behind this cover, Morton often indulged himself in opinionated rants about new inventions, motorists, Socialists, pretentious art, public schools, and whatever else aroused his wrath.\n\nUnder Morton's pen, \"By the Way\" continued for many years, surviving the Second World War paper shortages and consequent shrinkage of the \"Express\" to four pages. His mockery of both Nazi propaganda and British red tape was recognised as a huge contribution to morale, and Morton became a CBE in 1952. In 1965, the column was enlarged and made weekly.\n\nThe final column appeared on 29 November 1975 containing the headline \"Lawnmower Used on Vet's Whiskers\".\n\nA BBC radio programme \"Beachcomber by the Way\", based on the column, was broadcast for 18 episodes from 1989 to 1994, with Richard Ingrams playing the voice of Beachcomber. John Wells, John Sessions and Patricia Routledge played supporting parts, in particular Wells as the impertinent questioner Prodnose forever asking Beachcomber what he meant by what he said. \n\nMorton also wrote a few pieces on French history, in the style of his good friend Hilaire Belloc, but these were not widely read and are now forgotten. After his retirement, he started work on an autobiography, but said it would be a \"boring\" read and tore up his notes. Another work is \"SPRINGTIME: Tales of the Café Rieu\", describing life on the Parisian Left Bank.\n\nMorton fell in with J. C. Squire's circle of acquaintances. Squire was the editor of the \"London Mercury\", and his reputation for helping young writers had caused him to accrue a posse of writers and poets, which Morton was happy to join on excursions to pubs in the area of Fleet Street. Squire's amateur cricket team is described in \"England, Their England\" by A. G. Macdonell; the exuberant character Tommy Huggins is based on Morton. \n\nThis also introduced him to Hilaire Belloc, whose second son, Peter, became a close friend until his death in 1941. Belloc was 52 when Morton met him, and looked older. Both Belloc senior and Morton enjoyed cross-country walking, and improvising songs as they walked; the three of them sailed Belloc's cutter, the \"Nona\". Like Belloc, Morton was a Roman Catholic, and shared many of the attitudes of the Chesterton–Belloc circle.\n\nMorton applied his love of the surreal not just to his writing but to everyday life. Walking through Guildford one day with Gerald Barry, Morton stopped at a pillar box. He talked into its opening: \"Are you alright, my little man? Don't worry, we'll soon get you out.\" Soon, a concerned crowd gathered to see who was trapped inside. Somebody summoned the fire brigade to help, while Morton and Barry made a discreet exit. Events like this were quite frequent: on another occasion he littered Virginia Woolf's front doorstep with dozens of empty, quart-sized brown ale bottles.\n\nWyndham-Lewis recalls that on their first meeting, the door 'burst open' and 'a thick-set, bucolic figure, all over straw and clay, strode in and banged passionately on the floor with a thick gnarled stick uttering a roar soon known and feared in every pub on Fleet Street: \"Flaming eggs! will no one rid me of this stinking town?\"'.\n\nIn 1927 Morton married Mary O'Leary, an Irish doctor. This put an end to his spending time with his drinking friends, and to life in London. To escape the Labour government of the late forties, the couple moved to Dublin for two years, and then to Ferring in Worthing. This moving around didn't interfere with the column, which Morton hand-wrote (never having learned to type) on sheets of blue Basildon Bond and posted to the \"Express\". His new lifestyle did, though: Morton's writing became increasingly cynical, and he became \"a gloomy little man,\" in the words of his illustrator Nicolas Bentley. Richard Ingrams, who edited some Beachcomber collections, and appeared as Beachcomber on BBC Radio 4, described him as \"heavy-going and uncommunicative\" in his later years.\n\nThe couple were happy together until Mary's death in 1974; Morton lost his job the year after. His enforced retirement was not happy, and he lived alone, eating mostly bread and jam (Morton couldn't even boil an egg). He became quite confused and spent time looking for his wife, whom he believed to be still alive. Morton eventually settled in a nursing home, but insisted on addressing all the ladies there as Mary. After his death in 1979, aged 85, his house was demolished and all his papers destroyed.\n\n\nSee also under Beachcomber (pen name)\n\n\n"}

For his lasting contribution as a children's writer he received the biennial Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1970 and many consider him Italy's most important twentieth-century children's author. His books have been translated into many languages, though few have been published in English.\n\nRodari was born in Omegna, a small town on Lake Orta in the province of Novara in northern Italy. His father, a baker, died when Rodari was only eight. Rodari and his two brothers, Cesare and Mario, were raised by his mother in her native village, in the province of Varese. After three years at the seminary in Seveso, Rodari received his teacher's diploma at the age of seventeen and began to teach elementary classes in rural schools of the Varese district. He had interest in music (three years of violin lessons) and literature (discovered the works of Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Lenin and Trotsky which sharpened his critical sense). In 1939, for a short time, Rodari attended the Catholic University of Milan.\n\nDuring World War II, Rodari had a deferment from the army due to his ill health. Due to his precarious financial situation, he applied for work at the Casa del Fascio and was forced to join the National Fascist Party. Traumatized by the loss of his two best friends and his favorite brother Cesare's incarceration in a German concentration camp, Rodari joined the Italian Communist Party in 1944 and participated in the Italian resistance movement.\n\nIn 1948, as a journalist for the Communist periodical \"L'Unità\", he began writing books for children. In 1950, the Party installed him as editor of the new weekly children's magazine \"Il Pioniere\" in Rome. In 1951, Rodari published his first books, \"Il Libro delle Filastrocche\" and \"Il Romanzo di Cipollino\".\n\nIn 1952, he traveled for the first time to the Soviet Union, which he frequented thereafter. In 1953, he married Maria Teresa Feretti, who four years later gave birth to their daughter, Paola. In 1957, Rodari passed the exam to become a professional journalist.\n\nRodari spent the years 1966–1969 working intensively on collaborative projects with children. In 1970 he received the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for children's literature, which gained him a wide international reputation as the best modern children's writer in Italian. The biennial award by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children's books. His works have been translated into numerous languages.\n\nIn 1979, after another trip to the Soviet Union, his health, never very robust, declined and his productivity diminished. He died in Rome, following a surgical operation, in April 1980.\n\nHe is perhaps best known for developing the story of Cipollino. The story of Cipollino was popular enough to have a ballet staged in the Soviet Union in 1973, composed by Karen Khachaturian and choreographed by Genrik Alexandrovich Maiorov. Cipollino, or Little Onion, fights the unjust treatment of his fellow vegetable townfolk by the fruit royalty (Prince Lemon and the overly proud Tomato) in the garden kingdom. The main theme is the \"struggle of the underclass and the powerful, good versus evil\" and the importance of friendship in the face of difficulties.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2005655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2005655", "title": "The Detroit Partnership", "text": "The Detroit Partnership\n\nThe Detroit Partnership (DP), known as The Detroit Project until 2008, is a student-run organization at the University of Michigan with the mission of connecting the Ann Arbor and Detroit communities through active service-learning. Each year, the group holds weekly programs with over 200 students volunteering as tutors and mentors in schools, churches, and non-profits in the Brightmoor, East Side, and Southwest neighborhoods of Detroit. In addition to weekly service-learning programs, the organization also holds two large events. In the fall, The Detroit Partnership partners with community members to bring a large food and clothing drive titled One-Stop Shop to the citizens of Brightmoor and surrounding areas. Also, every March or April, the group routinely brings approximately 1300 student volunteers from the University of Michigan to sites in and around the city of Detroit for a one-day service-learning event known as DP Day.\n\nThe Detroit Partnership, known as The Detroit Project until February 2008, began in 1999 as an annual community service event. The day of service was named Detroit Project Day and took place on April 8, 2000. Since then, the group has grown significantly and has successfully transformed from a single annual community service event into one of the largest organizations at the University of Michigan with nearly 1,500 total volunteers participating each year in various service projects with Detroit community organizations.\n\nThe initial idea for The Detroit Project is credited to Katie Foley, who was at the time a junior at the University of Michigan and the President of Circle K, an organization on campus dedicated to service, friendship and leadership. From her experiences in Circle K, Katie saw a lack of opportunity for UM students to participate in community service projects with the nearby Detroit community, and, along with fellow UM student Sara Rowe, met with numerous Detroit community organizations to develop projects and events that would be most beneficial to both the Detroit community and UM students.\n\nThe organization began its work in the Brightmoor neighborhood of northwest Detroit, an area known both for its strong community network and largely impoverished conditions. Thus, the first DP Day, held on April 8, 2000, saw over 400 UM volunteers work at 32 different sites in Brightmoor planting trees and grass seed, cleaning parks, and demolishing abandoned homes, among other projects. In time for the 2000-2001 academic year, The then-Detroit Project retained Katie Foley as a returning Senior, and recruited a leadership team capable of growing the organization.\n\nThe DP, as it became known in Ann Arbor, steadily grew in its second year. Several smaller 'one-time events', similar to DP Day in many ways, were carried out throughout the year. Still, however, the focus remained on the large service day. The second DP Day, in March 2001, had over 1400 students register and is still considered the largest ever.\n\nBy 2004, The Detroit Project had grown to include weekly volunteering efforts involving over 20 programs and 100-150 volunteers - metrics the organization has maintained through 2010. In Brightmoor, DP programs expanded into more organizations and made several lasting and special relationships. This led to The DP's inclusion into an enduring neighborhood coalition called the Brightmoor Alliance.\n\nOne such important relationship was with Pastor Albert Rush at the West Outer Drive United Methodist Church (WODUMC). In 2005, Pastor Rush partnered with The DP for the first time to hold the 1st Annual One-Stop Shop at his Church. This, The DP's second large-scale event, entails the collection of food and clothing in both Ann Arbor and Detroit, extensive effort at organization and sorting of the donated goods, and, finally, the set-up of a department store \"atmosphere\" in the basement of WODUMC. On the day of the event, interested community members are offered a personal shopper as an aide navigating the aisles.\n\nHaving establishing a strong model for service-learning partnerships in Brightmoor, The Detroit Partnership expanded its efforts into Southwest Detroit in 2004. The DP has built strong partnerships with a number of community organizations and schools in this united and culturally vibrant neighborhood. Current service projects specific to the area include adult education, ESL, and work on immigration issues. In 2006, DP Day included sites in this neighborhood for the first time.\n\nAfter years of success The DP had evolved as an organization, and many of its student leaders felt unfulfilled with the specific nature of much of the organization's original language and vision (first in 2006, earlier by various individuals). Thus, on February 20, 2008, The Detroit Project officially changed its name to The Detroit Partnership to better reflect the organization's movement from an organization concentrated on one-sided service events (such as DP Day, where volunteers went en masse to work on projects to which they have never returned) to the development of programs and service learning through more intimate, and longer-lasting community partnerships (i.e. weekly programs). This shift did not mean an abandonment of large-scale service projects or DP Day, however, it did encourage a new frame and focus on most of the group's events. Ultimately, from the perspective of a student volunteer, this focus encouraged education and self-reflection throughout continual commitment (see Service Learning Ideology below).\n\nBy 2013, the Detroit Partnership consistently provides over 30 weekly service-learning programs with approximately 230 weekly volunteers.\n\nThe Detroit Partnership's 10th annual DP Day took place on March 28, 2009. Over 1000 volunteers from three Universities (University of Michigan, Michigan State University, and Wayne State University), over 30 community organizations, and the surrounding neighborhoods joined together to participate in service-learning projects. The keynote speaker at the DP Day 2009 rally was Detroit Mayor Kenneth Cockrel, Jr..\n\nOn April 3, 2010, the second-largest DP Day (per registered volunteers) to date occurred. 1248 individuals volunteered for the event, including individuals representing Wayne State University and several Ann Arbor High Schools. The keynote speaker for the DP Day 2010 rally was to be John Conyers Jr., the longtime representative of Michigan's 14th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. Unfortunately, due to dangerous weather conditions, DP Day 2010's outdoor rally was cancelled and Congressman Conyers was not able to speak.\n\nWeekly Programs have continued in full force with roughly 150 to 200 volunteers making it to Detroit each week. A related initiative, a DP-wide Education Team, was fully functioning by 2007. This section of the organization (see others under organization), champions Education efforts on the University's campus. Activities facilitated by the Ed Team often include seminar speakers, discussion chats, and food expos to name a few.\n\nThe Detroit Partnership is currently approved for government-recognized, non-profit, 501(c)3 status.\n\nDP Day 2013 took place on March 23, 2013; DP Day 2014 took place on March 29, 2014. The speakers at the latter year's rally included Lloyd Carr. \n\nIn May 2013, the organization added an Eastside team to its weekly programs. Its first programs will run in the Fall 2013 term.\n\nDP Day 2015 took place on March 28.\n\nOn February 24, 2010, The Detroit Partnership's official mission statement was amended to include the ideals of multiculturalism and social justice. This represented an additional shift in the organization's philosophy and kept in line with The DP's recent renaissance attitude, especially with the official adoption of a social justice theme. Changes were made to the mission statement again in 2015. The current mission statement reads as follows:\n\n\"We, The Detroit Partnership, seek to unite the University of Michigan and Detroit by working alongside community partners in the city. As a student-run, registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, we strive to raise awareness, challenge stereotypes, and promote social justice through our service-learning programs and educational events.\"\n\nAs stated in the mission statement, The Detroit Partnership believes strongly in the virtues of service learning. There is no one definition to service learning, however, it is best described as service work combined with an intentional education component.\n\nThe Detroit Partnership's focus entails:\n\nAccording to The Detroit Partnership's interpretation of these ideologies, the combination of the above goals will result in effective service learning that best serves their partner organizations and university members alike. From a volunteer participant's perspective, the organization maintains that the growth and benefit of DP members should ideally be a byproduct of their service - not the motivation behind their efforts - in order to truly achieve the benefits of service learning.\n\nThe Detroit Partnership currently comprises eight teams. Each team has a Director in charge of that area's organization and duties. The DP as a whole is led by an Executive Director who is charged with being the face of the organization both on campus and in the community.\n\nTeams are normally composed of between 6-8 members in addition to their Director. Collectively, the seven teams create the larger Planning Team of around 50 members. The Planning Team meets once-a-week and works towards the large-scale goals of the organization. All individuals that give their time in The DP programs at some point throughout the year are considered volunteers.\n\n\nCurrently, the DP partners with the following schools and organizations:\n\n\n\nCommunity Service Award - Center for Campus Involvement\n\nAlly Award - Center for Campus Involvement\"\n\nGinsberg Center (at The University of Michigan) Outstanding Community Impact Award\n\nUniversity of Michigan Outstanding Student Organization Award\n\nUniversity of Michigan Program of the Year: Detroit Project Day\n\nMichigan State Legislature - Special Tribute\n\nLeaderShape Palmer Award and Scholarship, 2000\n\nCircle K International First Place Single Service Award\n\n"}

Common names include crabgrass, finger-grass, and fonio. They are slender monocotyledonous annual and perennial lawn, pasture, and forage plants; some are often considered lawn pests. \"Digitus\" is the Latin word for \"finger\", and they are distinguished by the long, finger-like inflorescences they produce.\n\nThe seeds are edible most notably those of fonio (\"Digitaria exilis\" and \"Digitaria iburua\"), \"Digitaria sanguinalis\", as well as \"Digitaria compacta.\" They can be toasted, ground into a flour, made into porridge or fermented to make beer. Fonio has been widely used as a staple crop in parts of Africa. It also has decent nutrient qualities as a forage for cattle.\n\nThe prevalent species of \"Digitaria\" in North America are large crabgrass (\"D. sanguinalis\"), sometimes known as hairy crabgrass; and smooth crabgrass (\"D. ischaemum\"). These species often become problem weeds in lawns and gardens, growing especially well in thin lawns that are watered lightly, underfertilized, and poorly drained. They are annual plants, and one plant is capable of producing 150,000 seeds per season. The seeds germinate in the late spring and early summer and outcompete the domesticated lawn grasses, expanding outward in a circle up to in diameter. In the autumn when the plants die, they leave large voids in the lawn. The voids then become prime areas for the crabgrass seeds to germinate the following season.\n\nBiological control is preferable over herbicide use on lawns, as crabgrass emergence is not the cause of poor lawn health but a symptom, and it will return annually if the lawn is not restored with fertilization and proper watering. Crabgrass is quickly outcompeted by healthy lawn grass because, as an annual plant, crabgrass dies off in autumn and needs open conditions for its germination the following spring.\n\n"}

These proteins have been shown to have diverse functions in the development of the nervous system and play multiple essential roles in vertebrate embryogenesis including: cardiac development, Schwann cell and oligodendrocyte differentiation, some aspects of neuronal development, as well as the formation of neuromuscular synapses.\n\nIncluded in the family are heregulin; neu differentiation factor; acetylcholine receptor synthesis stimulator; glial growth factor; and sensory and motor-neuron derived factor. Multiple family members are generated by alternate splicing or by use of several cell type-specific transcription initiation sites. In general, they bind to and activate the erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (erbB2 (HER2), erbB3 (HER3), and erbB4 (HER4)), functioning both as heterodimers and homodimers.\n\nThe neuregulin family includes:\n\nIn mammals, neuregulin family members are the products of 4 genes NRG1, NRG2, NRG3 and NRG4 respectively.\n\nThe transmembrane forms of neuregulin 1 (NRG1) are present within synaptic vesicles, including those containing glutamate. After exocytosis, NRG1 is in the presynaptic membrane, where the ectodomain of NRG1 may be cleaved off. The ectodomain then migrates across the synaptic cleft and binds to and activates a member of the EGF-receptor family on the postsynaptic membrane. This has been shown to increase the expression of certain glutamate-receptor subunits. NRG1 appears to signal for glutamate-receptor subunit expression, localization, and /or phosphorylation facilitating subsequent glutamate transmission.\n\nThe NRG1 gene has been identified as a potential gene determining susceptibility to schizophrenia by a combination of genetic linkage and association approaches.\n\nARIA plays a role in synapse development, influencing the upregulation of acetylcholine receptor genes beneath the endplate after mammalian motor neurons have made synaptic contact with muscle fibres, hence its name ARIA = Acetylcholine Receptor Inducing Activity.\n\nA study done on mice in early 2009 has indicated that when neuregulin-1\\ErbB signalling is disrupted, the dendritic spines of neurons grow but do not fully form. This produced no immediate noticeable changes to brain development, but in adults there was a reduction of dendritic spines on neurons.

{"id": "2005691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2005691", "title": "Prophecy of Neferti", "text": "Prophecy of Neferti\n\nThe Prophecy of Neferti is one of the few surviving literary texts from ancient Egypt. The story is set in the Old Kingdom, under the reign of King Snefru. However, the text should be attributed to an individual named Neferyt, who most likely composed it at the beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty. The nature of the literary text is argued upon. There are a number of different theories stating that the literature is a historical romance in pseudo-prophetic form, political literature, religious motivation as well as a literary text created to change and improve the situation in Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty.\n\nThe Prophecies of Neferti is set in the fictional court of King Snefru (c. 2575–2551 BC), who ruled Egypt during the Fourth Dynasty. The sage Neferti is summoned to the court so that he can entertain the King with fine speeches. He is asked to speak of the future rather than the past, the sage prophesies the downfall of the Egyptian nation by civil war, leading to the eventual atonement of the nation through the rise of a great king. According to Neferti this king, “Ameny”, will redeem the chaos, banish enemies, and set all right.\n\n“The transliteration follows Helck 1970b, using the copy on Papyrus Hermitage 1116B as principal source. The section divisions are those of Helck 1970b: after each section number are given the corresponding line-numbers in Papyrus Hermitage 1116B.” \n\n13 (Papyrus Hermitage 1116B, lines 57 to 61)\n\n“nswt pw r iyt n rsy\nimny mAa xrw rn.f\nsA Hmt pw n tA sty\nms pw n Xn nxn\niw.f r Ssp HDt\niw.f r wTs dSrt\niw.f smA sxmty\niw.f r sHtp nbwy\nm mrt.sn\npXr iHy m xfa wsr m nwd\n\nThere is a king who will come from the south\nAmeny true of voice is his name.\nHe is the son of a woman of the Land of the Bow,\nhe is a child of the Heartland of Nekhen.\nHe will take up the White Crown,\nhe will raise up the Red Crown,\nhe will unite the Two Mighty Goddesses,\nhe will appease the Two Lord Gods,\nwith what they desire.\nThe field circuit is in his grasp, the oar in the jump.”\n\nAmenemhat I, who is theorized to be “Ameny” in “The Prophecies of Neferti”, was the first ruler of the Twelfth Dynasty. He “inherited territorial unification, but faced a formidable political task. Kingship had become discredited and locally independent power had become strong. Internal reorganization around a strong central government was the task” (Wilson 275). The history of the Twelfth Dynasty leads scholars to believe that “The Prophecy of Neferti” was written as political propaganda, in order to show Amenemhat I’s claim to kingship. \n\n“What survives of the secular literature of ancient Egypt is a small number of texts. It is impossible to establish conclusively whether they are indicative of the scope of the literary production or whether they are the incidental survivors of the adversaries of the time and men. Among the surviving literary texts from ancient Egypt is, “The Prophecy of Neferti”. It has only one complete version, which is portrayed on two writing tablets (Cairo 25224 and BM 5647) from the Eighteenth Dynasty. This complete version is held at the Hermitage Museum in Saint-Petersburg. Although there is only one complete version, there are numerous Ramesside partial copies of the work, over twenty, which is much higher than other well-known Egyptian literature works. The work is theorized to originally date to the Twelfth Dynasty under the reign of King Amenemhat I. Hans Goedicke argues that this literary work was undoubtedly written for contemporaries, who were fully familiar with the current events and in no way for readers of the distant future.\n\nThere is not one interpretation of the prophecy that is widely agreed upon. Rather, there are numerous supported theories based on the interpretations of respected scholars, ranging from simplistic explanations to in-depth critical analyses. The most widely accepted interpretation revolves around the theory that it was produced as propagandistic literature for the newly established Twelfth Dynasty under the rule of King Amenemhat I. This was an early interpretation and numerous others are now considered.\nHans Goedicke in his book, “The Protocol of Neferyt”, argues that “the text does not contain a prophecy of future events but is an elaboration of existing conditions in the Eastern border region and potential dangers resulting therefrom”. This, much like all Egyptian history, is a debated idea. It is important to note though, being that it places “The Prophecy of Neferty” in a new light; it takes away the possible glorification of Amenemhat I and instead places the purpose of the literary text, as one used to change and improve the situation in Egypt.\n\nLudwig Morenz added to the debate in 2003 with his book, “Literature as a construction of the past in the Middle Kingdom”. He believes that the only reason historical royal names appear in the text, “is to give the text a flavor of historicity and as being proto-mythical” (107). Morenz goes on to say, the author of the literature text lived several centuries after King Snofru, most likely during the Twelfth Dynasty and concrete historical memory was being re-cast as proto-myth. He also argues that the “prophetic genre of text probably derives from this notion of the possibility of knowing history” (111). A significant point that Morenz makes is that, the literary text could have been composed for the coronation of the King but gradually lost its concrete links with it. There is one key point that both Goedicke and Morenz seem to agree on, that the literature text unarguably laments the decline of Egypt as a country with the beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty.\n\nThe third argument presented is by Jose Perez-Accino. \n“Description of the land in chaos and turmoil shows clear primeval overtones. Several phrases can be understood as referring to a time before the creation of the world. The vision of Neferty thus seems to present a metaphor in which the time of trouble is related to a time in which creation has reverted into an original chaos and so the process of creation needs to start again” (1498).\nPerez-Accino compares the rise of Ameny with the creation of the world. His views differ greatly from most scholars; he believes the literary text discusses the mythological founder, Menes, as the king and not Amenemhat I directly, although the description given in the text is valid for both of them. This argument is supported by puns, as well as the idea that the literature is written in primeval and mythological context. If this is true, then from this literary text, Amenemhat I is a new Menes, “who will perform the Gods’ wishes and put an end to a condition which has afflicted the land” (Perez-Accino 1499). With this idea, the Twelfth Dynasty would be comparable to the original creation of the country.\n\n\nGoedicke, Hans. The Protocol of Neferyt: The Prophecy of Neferti.

It was founded in 1959 and in 1962 was one of the five tournaments that made up the inaugural Far East Circuit, later known as the Asia Golf Circuit. It remained part of the circuit until 1996, before joining the Asian Tour, then known as the Omega Tour, in 1997. It became co-sanctioned by the European Tour in 2001, as part of the 2002 season.\n\nThe Hong Kong Open was played in spring from its inception until 1994, but since 1995 has usually been played towards the end of the year, in November or December, and as a result has often fallen into the following year's European Tour season.\n\nSince taking its place on the European Tour the event has always been held at the Hong Kong Golf Club in Sheung Shui, New Territories. The Hong Kong Golf Association, Hong Kong PGA, and Chinese PGA receive a limited number of exemptions into the tournament for their members. \n\nIn 1958, Hong Kong Golf Club member Kim Hall wrote to Australian professional Eric Cremin to see if those players playing in the Philippine Open in 1959 would consider staying in the region to play in Hong Kong. Hall then approached Peter Plumley, secretary of \"South China Morning Post\", who was also a golfer. Plumley then persuaded his boss to sponsor 1,000 Australian pounds in prize money in the name of \"South China Morning Post\". Then, the first Hong Kong Open was launched in February 1959. According to Hong Kong Golf Club member Willie Woo, Kim Hall was very keen for the tournament and he talked a lot with Australian golfers, including Peter Thompson. Woo helped to get Taiwanese players through his connections.\n\nThe first tournament was hosted by Sir Robert Black, the then-Governor of Hong Kong. Around one thousand spectators joined the tournament. Taiwanese golfer Lu Liang-huan won the inaugural edition of the tournament. The success of the Hong Kong Open prompted first Singapore in 1961, and then Malaysia and Japan in 1962, to introduce their own tournaments and bring about the setting up of the Far East Golf Circuit. The circuit further expanded into a regular ten-tournament tour, called the Asia Golf Circuit, that existed until the end of the twentieth century.\nDespite the SCMP's original agreement to maintain 1,000 pounds sponsorship of the Hong Kong Open, it was felt that prize money would need to be increased if the best players were to be attracted. To that end the 1963 event was jointly sponsored by the SCMP and British American Tobacco, with the purse being increased to 4,000 pounds as a result.\nDue to poor weather conditions during the 1966 event, the Hong Kong Golf Club lost HK$10,442 as the money put up by the sponsors was insufficient to cover expenses. As a result, the club decided that in future it could not undertake to assist financially in any way, but would continued provide the courses and the general facilities. The 1968 tournament was the first edition to be shown live on television. In 1969, the newly formed the Hong Kong Golf Association took up the task of organising the tournament. In 1971, the Hong Kong Open was on the verge of disappearing due to low spectator numbers and financial problems, but with the assistance of the Asia Pacific Golf Confederation, who were keen to retain the event on the Asia Golf Circuit, the tournament was saved.\n\nIn 1996, Hong Kong golfer Dominique Boulet finished fourth, the best result by a local golfer. In 2008, Florida-based Hong Kong amateur Hak Shun-yat became the youngest player ever to make the cut in a European Tour event, at 14 years and 304 days, eclipsing the record set by Sergio García at the Turespaña Open Mediterrania in 1995. At the other end of the age spectrum, Miguel Ángel Jiménez became the oldest golfer ever to win on the European Tour when he won in 2012 at age , and extended his record by defending his title in 2013 at age .\n\nIn 2013, organizers and potential sponsors raised concerns over the complex becoming enmeshed in a controversial redevelopment plan for Fan Ling.

Freeborn's most famous work is creating the make-up for all of the characters in the \"Star Wars\" trilogy, including Chewbacca and Yoda; he based Yoda on his own face and partly on Albert Einstein. He oversaw the design of the original Jabba the Hutt puppet used in \"Return of the Jedi\", as well as the creation of the Ewoks.\n\nFreeborn was also the make-up artist on Stanley Kubrick's \"\", where he created the humans/apes for the \"Dawn of Man\" sequence. He worked on Kubrick's \"Dr. Strangelove\", handling Peter Sellers' multiple lead roles.

It is the second highest mountain in New York, and one of the 46 Adirondack High Peaks in Adirondack Park. Its name comes from its reputedly being on the Algonquian side of a nearby informal boundary between the Algonquian and their Iroquois neighbors.\n\nAlgonquin is popular with hikers, accessible from the popular Adirondak Loj trailhead near Heart Lake outside Lake Placid for a day trip. While the climb is shorter than that of nearby Mount Marcy, it is steeper, requiring almost as much vertical ascent in a considerably shorter distance.\n\nThe usual route is via the blue-blazed Van Hoevenberg Trail to its junction with the yellow-blazed MacIntyre Range Trail and following that the remaining to the summit, during which the route gets progressively steeper and rockier, going over many steep rock chutes called \"slides\".\nThe mountain's summit is an alpine zone above tree line, and views of the surrounding high peaks are available in all directions. However, the large numbers of hikers on the summit have in the past caused damage to the fragile plant life, and strict regulations have been put in place both at the trailhead and on the summit (all hikers must sign in; no dogs are allowed without a leash) to protect it. On busy days a Summit Steward both reminds hikers of these rules and educates them about the ecosystem.\n\nLess frequently, the mountain is approached from the southeast via the steep, narrow, Boundary Trail from Lake Colden. This trail is also dangerous because of the poor markings and steep, slippery slides that streams have formed on.\n\n"}

It was previously known as \"Kinghorn Museum\", and is located on what was once known as Kinghorn, now subsumed by King City. It is operated by the township Parks, Recreation and Culture Department and is curated by Kathleen Fry.\n\nThe Museum is affiliated with the Canadian Museums Association (CMA), the Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN), and the Virtual Museum of Canada.\n\nThe museum consists of a building which houses the majority of collections held. This building was originally built in 1861 as the site of the Kinghorn School SS #23. It was updated and expanded in 1958 and again in 1963, and purchased by the township in 1978. The township gave operational control of the building to the King Township Historical Society, which established the museum in 1979 and opened it in 1982. The museum was operated on a volunteer basis until 2001, when the township municipal government assumed control of the museum. The government established a management board, to which individuals are appointed by the township council.\n\nIn 2012, a addition was built by the real estate development company Genview Homes, which leased it and used it as its sales office for a development adjacent to the museum grounds in exchange for repairing or upgrading damaged parts of the building. The flat, leaky roof was rebuilt as a peaked roof. Once vacated by Genview, the space may be used for various services, such as a lecture hall with a capacity of 60 to 80 guests.\n\nOn the grounds of the 2.5 acre property owned by the museum are several heritage sites. The King Township Historical Society raised funds to acquire and move \"King Station\" from Black Creek Pioneer Village to the grounds in 1989, where it now fronts King Road. It was the original railway station building of Springhill (now King City), and believed to be the oldest surviving railway station in Canada, built by the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway in 1852 and first served passengers in 1853. The single-storey board and batten structure was in poor shape by then, and restoration began soon after to repair the damage. It was painted green and grey after the initial restoration, and is now painted cream yellow with green trim. It is the only surviving station building of the original Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway buildings.\n\nThe other heritage building is the \"King Christian Church\" built in 1851 by the Children of Peace, a religious group active in Sharon from the 1810s to the 1890s. It was renamed to the \"King Emmanuel Baptist Church\" in 1931 and permanently closed in 1978. It was moved from its original location at Kettleby Road and Jane Street to the museum grounds in 1982.\nIn August 2017, Laskay Hall was moved to the site from its original location in Laskay. It will be used for cultural programs such as art, music, dance, and theatre; an event venue for Laskay residents; a performing arts space; and as an additional exhibit for the museum. A basement will eventually be built for it, which will be used for storage by the museum and Arts Society King.\n\nThe site also contains a dredge built in the 1970s that was used to clear the canals of the Holland Marsh until the 1990s, and was obtained by the museum in 2001.\n\nThe museum's collection contains over 1,800 artifacts associated with the township's history, such as books, clothing, tools, and other household items.\n\nKing Township Museum operates a variety of March break and summer camps, and established an Art Camp and Puppet Theatre Camp in 2006. Since 2006, the museum has hosted \"Music at the Museum\", a weekly concert showcasing local musical talent.\n\nWorks of local and regional artists are also exhibited by the museum.\n\nThe museum conducts several annual events, including a trunk sale, a fundraising antique appraisal, an appreciation barbecue for its volunteers, and a garden tea hosted by the Nobleton and King City Horticultural Society at the beginning of summer. It participates in Doors Open and the Arts Society of King studio tour, and hosts Christmas and Halloween celebrations.\n\nThe church may be rented for small weddings.\n\nOne-time events hosted by the museum include a reenactment of the 1837 Upper Canada Rebellion, retracing the route of the rebels from Lloydtown to Toronto. The six-hour tour stopped at the rebel statue in Lloydtown, Gibson House in North York, and Mackenzie House in Toronto.\n\nThe most famous person associated with the museum is Walter Rolling, who taught at the schoolhouse for over 40 years. The school was originally one room, but was expanded later. In the late 1970s, the school was converted into what is now the King Township Museum.\n\nIn 2012, the museum board undertook a program to create a 5-10 year strategic business plan to replace the ad-hoc volunteer administration plan. As part of the project, physical accessibility to the museum will be improved and business hours extended.\n\nIt will also change the administrative structure to eliminate board appointments by the township council, replacing the board with a community museum board.\n\nIn late 2011, the museum received a bequest of .\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2005739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2005739", "title": "John Frederick Lewis", "text": "John Frederick Lewis\n\nJohn Frederick Lewis (London 14 July 1804 – 15 August 1876) was an English Orientalist painter. He specialized in Oriental and Mediterranean scenes in detailed watercolour or oils, very often repeating the same composition in a version in each medium. He lived for several years in a traditional mansion in Cairo, and after his return to England in 1851 he specialized in highly detailed works showing both realistic genre scenes of Middle Eastern life and more idealized scenes in upper class Egyptian interiors with little apparent Western influence.\n\nHis very careful and loving representation of Islamic architecture, furnishings, screens, and costumes set new standards of realism, which influenced other artists, including the leading French Orientalist painter Jean-Léon Gérôme in his later works. Unlike many other Orientalist painters who took a salacious interest in the women of the Middle East, he \"never painted a nude\", and his wife modelled for several of his harem scenes. These, with the rare examples by the classicist painter Lord Leighton, imagine \"the harem as a place of almost English domesticity, ... [where]... women's fully clothed respectability suggests a moral healthiness to go with their natural good looks\".\n\nHe was the son of Frederick Christian Lewis (1779–1856), an engraver and landscape painter, whose German father had moved to England and changed his name from Ludwig. The leading bookbinder Charles Lewis was John Frederick's uncle, and his younger brothers, another Frederick Christian and Charles George Lewis, were also artists, the latter mainly in reproductive engraving, especially after Edwin Landseer (1802-1873), a childhood neighbour and friend of John Frederick.\n\nLewis and Landseer trained together in the workshop of Sir Thomas Lawrence. Initially Lewis, like Landseer, was an animal painter, and he often included animals throughout his later works, in particular a pet gazelle he had in Cairo. He published prints of the big cats in 1826 and twelve domesticated animals in 1826, and painted two large scenes with animals in Windsor Great Park, now Royal Collection (\"John Clark(e) with the animals at Sandpit Gate\", c. 1825) and Tate Britain.\n\nLewis toured Europe in 1827, the year he began to paint in watercolour, then travelled in Spain and Morocco between 1832 and 1834. The drawings he made were turned into lithographs by him and other artists, and published as \"Sketches and Drawings of the Alhambra, made during a Residence in Granada in the Years 1833–4\" (1835) and \"Lewis's Sketches of Spain and Spanish Character\" (1836). For a while he became known as \"Spanish Lewis\", to distinguish him from \"Indian Lewis\", his brother Frederick Christian, who went India in 1834 before dying young.\n\nLewis was an early traveller on what was to become a well-trodden route for English artists, though some ten years behind David Wilkie in Spain. David Roberts, who became the other leading British Orientalist, mainly through his lithographs, was in Spain and the Middle East at the same time as Lewis, though the two rarely met, and William James Müller had been in Cairo in 1838. But no other English artist of the period had such a sustained period in what was then the Ottoman Empire as Lewis did on his last period abroad.\n\nIn 1837 he left for travels that took him to Constantinople in 1840, after Italy and Greece. He continued to Egypt and lived in Cairo in rather grand style between 1841 and 1851, in a traditional upper-class house that he often used as a setting for his paintings. He was visited by William Makepeace Thackeray, an old friend, who described him in the comic account of his travels he published as a \"languid Lotus-eater\" leading a \"dreamy, hazy, lazy, tobaccofied life\" in a version of local dress that included a \"Damascus scimitar\" – Lewis was often photographed in such a costume in later life. In 1847 he married Marian Harper in Alexandria.\n\nIn Egypt he made large numbers of precise drawings that he turned into paintings after his return to England in 1851. He lived in Walton-on-Thames from 1854 until his death. In 1850 his watercolour \"The Hareem\" (now in a private collection in Japan, and rather faded) was a huge hit when exhibited in London, and praised by John Ruskin and other critics. This is in fact the \"only major work certainly completed\" in Cairo before his return.\n\nHe continued to paint watercolours for most of the 1850s, before returning to painting with similar subjects and style in oils, which were quicker to produce and sold for better prices.\n\nHe wrote to a colleague: \"Generally in spite of all my hard work, I find water colour to be thoroly [sic] unremunerative that I can stand it no longer—it is all, all always, rolling the stone up the hill—no rest, and such little pay!\"\n\nIn the 1860s his usual practice was to paint two versions of the same composition, in oils (to exhibit at the Royal Academy) and also watercolour, trying to push the price of the latter up to approach that of the former. In his technique, \"Independently of the Pre-Raphaelites, Lewis had evolved a similar method, applying colour with a minute touch on a white ground to produce a glowing jewel-like effect\". \nLewis became an Associate of the Royal Academy (ARA) in 1859 and a member (an RA) in 1865, and was President of the Society of Painters in Water Colours from 1855, though this was just as he was abandoning the technique for oils. The Society did not allow members to exhibit works in oils, which Lewis now wanted to do, and he resigned in 1858.\n\nLewis wrote very little, even letters, and when he was required to address the watercolourists as their president at a dinner in 1855, he stood up and after a while sat down again without saying a word. Partly as a result of the absence of sources, no full biography was published until 2014. Lewis continued to paint and exhibit almost up to the end of his life, but in 1873 he seems to have suffered a crisis in his health from which he never recovered before his death in 1876. After being largely forgotten for decades, he became extremely fashionable, and expensive, from the 1970s and good works now fetch prices into the millions of dollars or pounds at auction.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was initially founded as the JDF, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. It later changed its name to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and is now known as JDRF.\n\nJDRF was founded to find a cure for juvenile diabetes; in the 2000s, it broadened its research efforts to include ways to better manage the disease and ways to prevent it.\n\nIn 2005 the board of JDRF committed to supporting work on medical devices to manage blood glucose, known as artificial pancreas technology. The Board was urged to do so by Jeffrey Brewer, who founded and sold Citysearch, and had become interested in juvenile diabetes and medical devices after his son was diagnosed with the condition. The focus was on integrating continuous glucose monitors (CGM's) and insulin pumps via a computerized program that would use blood glucose levels obtained through the CGM to calculate an insulin dosage to be dispensed through the insulin pump. The first such device was approved in 2016.\n\nJDRF has advocated for stem cell research; in a 2004 article in \"The Wall Street Journal\", the authors observed that the JDRF \"... has become adept at unleashing an army of hard-to-resist lobbyists – made up of determined parents and their afflicted children – on researchers, politicians and potential donors.\"\n\nIn 2011, the FDA had made it a priority to clarify the requirements for approval for such a closed-loop monitoring and drug delivery device for T1D, and announced it was preparing draft guidelines. JDRF launched a campaign to influence those guidelines to be lenient. After the first closed loop device was approved in 2016, JDRF lobbied insurance companies to cover it. The campaign also put resources into educating people with diabetes on how to navigate health insurance in the United States, and into lobbying Congress to continue funding diabetes research through the NIH.\n\nThe FDA lobbying campaign was part of a gradual realignment of the organization to focus on issues other than helping find a cure for JD, but to help treat and manage the disease. This broadened scope meant that the organization increasingly directed its funds to education and advocacy, along with research funding. This included lobbying insurance companies to pay for GCM devices, educating patients on how to advocate for themselves, and lobbying Congress for more NIH funding.\n\nThe UK arm of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDRF) was founded by Richard Lawson in 1986. In 1988 he became Director. The Foundation is now known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) and is \"the leading global organisation funding Type 1 Diabetes research\".\n\nIn 2019, JDRF International appointed its first-ever CEO and President with Type 1 Diabetes, Dr. Aaron Kowalski. Prior to taking this role, Dr. Kowalski served as JDRF’s Chief Mission Officer for five years.\n\nIn 2018, JDRF provided $85 million (37% of their total income) to T1D scientific research grants, they provided $156.4 million (67% of their total income) in 2008.\n\n"}

They formed in 1979 and disbanded in 1986. They are most remembered for their 1985 hit \"I'll Be Good\".\n\nThey recorded three albums for Capitol Records: their 1980 self-titled debut \"René & Angela\", the second album \"Wall to Wall\" and their final album for the label, 1983's \"Rise\".\n\nThey later moved to Mercury Records to release 1985's \"Street Called Desire\". Despite the success of the album, the group disbanded by the end of 1986. Disagreements and conflicts caused tension within the band. Moore claimed the source of tension was due to Winbush lending her songwriting and production talents to other artists – most notably, The Isley Brothers, with whom she wrote and produced their 1987 album \"Smooth Sailin'\". However, Winbush said the demise of the group was due to Moore's violent behavior- including an onstage incident in Cleveland, Ohio in 1986, as well as Winbush singing sole lead on the song \"Your Smile\", which became a number one hit.\n\nWinbush said of the dissolution of their partnership:\n\n\"It was a shame to break up just when we finally got hot. PolyGram didn't want us to break up. But there was no choice. I couldn't work with him anymore.\"\n\nThe duo had a less than amicable split and the animosity was so intense that Moore and Winbush had to communicate through attorneys.\n\nMoore and Winbush went on to successful solo careers as performers, songwriters, and producers. Moore lent his songwriting and production talents to Michael Jackson's 1991 \"Dangerous\" and 1995 \"\" albums and later formed Multi-Media Communications, which operated radio stations from 2008 to 2012.

These two groups are not each other's closest relatives, so have been split into two separate genera. Most of the Old World members remain in the genus \"Arabis\", whereas most of the New World members have been moved into the genus \"Boechera\", with only a few remaining in \"Arabis\".\n\n\nSome species, notably \"Arabis alpina\", are cultivated as ornamental plants in gardens.

He succeeded his father as the 3rd Baron Tweedmouth and is thus descended from Joseph Marjoribanks, a wine and fish merchant in Edinburgh who died in 1635. Joseph Marjoribanks is thought to have been the grandson of Thomas Marjoribanks of Ratho, head of the lowland Clan Marjoribanks.\n\nHe was a pupil at Harrow School and joined the Royal Horse Guards in 1895.\n\nIn 1897, he was promoted to lieutenant and served with a composite regiment of the Household Cavalry in the Second Anglo-Boer War in South Africa from 1899-1902. He was present at the Relief of Kimberly and several other battles in Orange Free State, the Transvaal Colony and the Cape Colony. He was Mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Queen's South Africa Medal with six clasps and was appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 29 November 1900.\n\nIn early 1901 he was asked by the new King Edward VII to take part in a special diplomatic mission to announce the King´s accession to the governments of France, Spain, and Portugal. The following year, he was appointed a Member (fifth class) of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO). In September 1902, Marjoribanks accompanied Lord Roberts, Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, and St John Brodrick, Secretary of State for War (and his father-i-law), on a visit to Germany to attend the German army maneuvers as guest of the Emperor Wilhelm. During the visit he was created a Knight 2nd class of the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle. He was promoted to the rank of captain in 1904 and from 1905-1908 he was appointed Military Secretary to the High Commissioner in South Africa. In 1908 he was promoted to Major and was Director of Army Accounts and Quarter Master General for the West Lancashire Division from 1908-1910.\n\nIn the First World War he served with the Royal Horse Guards from 1914-1918 and was involved in the early battles. On 25 October 1914, 'Beef' as he was known was shot in the leg when trying to carry out a regimental action. \"I had to stop and get into Hugh Grosvenor's trench. Got out presently and shot my horse with my revolver and saved all my kit. We were very lucky considering the fire we came in for.\" At the end of the war he served with the Guards Machine Gun Regiment from 1918-1919. During the war he was promoted to Lieutenant-colonel and created a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG).\n\nAfter succeeding as Lord Tweedmouth, he was Lord-in-waiting to King Edward VII and King George V.\n\nHe was said to be an excellent shot - having spent much time at his father's Glen Affric Shooting Estate - and had an amiable personality but had financial difficulties throughout his life.\n\nLord Tweedmouth married, at St George's, Hanover Square, London on 30 November 1901, Lady Muriel Brodrick (1881-1966), eldest daughter of St John Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton and Lady Hilda Charteris. They had two daughters, Moyra and Millicent Joan and the title Baron Tweedmouth became extinct on his death.\n"}

His firm made its business handling plaintiff's litigation, including representing clients suing breast implant manufacturers, medical facilities, and tobacco companies. In 2009, O'Quinn, along with his passenger, died in a single car crash in Houston, Texas.\n\nBorn to Leonard and Jean Wilkes O’Quinn, John Maurice O'Quinn spent his early years in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The family moved to Houston when O’Quinn was a toddler, but his mother, an alcoholic, left the family when he was 4, not to return. O'Quinn was raised in a post-war era bungalow in Houston's West University Place and worked in his father's car garage. He was a top student at Houston's Lamar High School, showing an aptitude in math and science, and enrolled at Rice University, majoring in engineering; however, after being placed on academic probation for \"three of the six semesters there\", he spoke with a vocational counselor who recommended career testing to determine the best bet for his future. Q'Quinn reflected, \"After the test, I was told I was a people person, I liked to help people, fight for beliefs, punish bullies and that I should be a trial lawyer.\" At the time, the fledgling University of Houston law school did not require a college degree for admission; 90 hours of credit would suffice, so after receiving his father's blessing, he enrolled that fall.\n\nO'Quinn graduated first in his class from the University of Houston Law Center in 1967, served as editor of the \"Houston Law Review\", and won a state moot court championship. O'Quinn was such an intellectual powerhouse that he was the first attorney hired from U of H by the law firm Baker Botts. O'Quinn was divorced and had no children. In 1999, the playing field at Robertson Stadium was named O'Quinn Field in honor of his generosity and support of the stadium renovations. After the demolition of that stadium, the \"O'Quinn Field\" name was subsequently used for its successor, John O'Quinn Field at TDECU Stadium.\n\nMaking his name in handling plaintiff's litigation, among O'Quinn's biggest wins were a $1 billion verdict in 2006 against Wyeth Laboratory for its diet drugs, fen-phen, $17.3 billion tobacco settlement for the state of Texas, and $100 million for silicone breast implants made by Dow Corning.\n\nIn total, O'Quinn is estimated to have won $1.5 billion for his firm. The firm went through several names during the 1990s, among them O’Quinn, Kerensky & McAninch; O’Quinn, Kerensky, McAninch & Laminack; and O’Quinn & Laminack. Pirtle became a name partner in September 2001, and the firm name became O’Quinn, Laminack & Pirtle. According to a 2006 article in \"Forbes\", O'Quinn's firm had pending cases against stock brokers and hedge funds for shorting the shares of weak companies, and against Ford for rollover accidents caused by the Ford Explorer. In the past decade, O'Quinn won, through settlement and/or verdicts, more than $20 billion for his clients.\n\nAround 8:00 a.m. on October 29, 2009, O'Quinn was driving his Chevrolet Suburban on Allen Parkway in Houston, Texas in rainy weather when the vehicle struck a curb, crossed a grassy median and three lanes of oncoming traffic, and crashed into a tree. Both O'Quinn and the other occupant, his assistant, Johnny Lee Cutliff, died instantly of blunt force injuries. Neither man was wearing a seat belt. According to Capt. Bill Staney of the Houston Police Department's Vehicular Crimes Division, the Suburban's crash data computer showed the vehicle traveling at 76 mph just before impact, and that O'Quinn never applied his brakes. The posted speed limit on that section of Allen Parkway was 40 mph.\n\nO'Quinn attended an exhibition of Duesenbergs as a child at the Sam Houston Coliseum, to see what his father called \"the greatest car ever built.\" In 2003, O'Quinn saw a 1932 Duesenberg Durham Tourister for sale at a Houston auction, at which he bought 14 cars that day including the Duesenberg for $405,000.\n\nO'Quinn maintained an extensive collection of cars. The collection had a total value of over $100 million and included at least 618 cars in 2006, and by the time of his death in 2009 he had collected about 800 cars. The collection included: seven Duesenbergs; the 1911 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost featured in the film \"Titanic;\" John F Kennedy's 1962 Lincoln Continental Bubble Top limo, and a 1937 Bugatti Type 57 Atlantic.\n\nIn September 2006, he bought: a 2005 Lamborghini Gallardo covered with 33 celebrity autographs ($500,000); the Batmobile used in the filming of Batman Forever ($335,000), a 1941 Packard limousine used by President Franklin D. Roosevelt ($290,000), a 1938 Talbot-Lago ($3,350,000); and a 1938 Town Car used by Pope Pius XII ($250,000).\n\nThe centerpiece of the collection is a plain grey 1975 Ford Escort GL, once owned by Polish priest Karol Wojtyla – before he went on to become Pope John Paul II. Bought at the Kruse auction at SEMA, the car was sold by the Pope at auction for charity to Chicago restaurateur Jim Rich in 1995, who paid $102,000 for the car. O'Quinn paid $690,000 for the car October 2005.\n\nIn late 2006 O'Quinn discovered that several cars were missing from his collection, including a Ferrari 575M and a 1965 Ford Shelby Mustang GT350. O'Quinn tried to get in touch with Zev Isgur, a 32-year-old ex-con whom he'd befriended and entrusted with the management of his collection of classic cars. Isgur was later convicted of embezzlement.\n\nOn October 10, 2011 a car from O'Quinn's collection which is said to be the world’s oldest running motor car, a historic 1884 De Dion Bouton et Trepardoux Dos-a-Dos Steam Runabout, sold at auction for $4.62 million in Hershey, Pennsylvania.\n\n"}

{"id": "2005802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2005802", "title": "Marco Di Vaio", "text": "Marco Di Vaio\n\nMarco Di Vaio (; born 15 July 1976) is a retired Italian footballer who played as a striker. A prolific goalscorer, in his long club career, Di Vaio scored over 200 league goals while playing for several clubs, mainly in Italy, as well as in Monaco, Spain, and Canada. At international level, Di Vaio represented the Italy national football team at Euro 2004.\n\nDi Vaio started his career at his hometown club Lazio. He made his Serie A debut on 20 November 1994 against Padova. He then played for Serie B clubs such as Verona and Bari before moving to Salernitana in 1997.\n\nHe was a revelation at Salernitana, leading them to their second promotion to the Serie A in 1997–98 as the top scorer in Serie B for that season.\n\nDespite Salernitana's relegation the following season, Di Vaio remained in Serie A, after being purchased by Parma. He scored an impressive number of goals for the Gialloblu and he went on to become the 2nd highest scorer of the league in his third season for the team.\n\nJuventus won the race to sign him during the following summer (2002), by paying Parma €7million (€2million plus 50% registration rights of Brighi) for the loan.\n\nBut Di Vaio never really reproduced the form he showed at Parma, mainly because of the immense competition for a first-team places at Juventus. Initially a loan signing, he was signed permanently in summer 2003 for €14 million.\n\nDuring his stay with Juventus he managed to win one \"scudetto\", and reached 2003 UEFA Champions League Final.\n\nDue to an early exit from the UEFA Champions League 2003–04 and coupled with the arrival of new coach Fabio Capello, Juventus began a restructuring of their first team squad. As a result, Di Vaio and his striking partner Fabrizio Miccoli were soon frozen out. Di Vaio moved to defending UEFA Cup and La Liga champions Valencia on a 5-year contract, costing Valencia €10.5million, joining up with fellow countrymen, coach Claudio Ranieri and new signing Bernardo Corradi. Di Vaio partnered Corradi up front in 10 La Liga matches, creating a total of 4 goals. He managed a mere eleven league goals during his spell in Spain.\n\nHis presence in the first team line-up of Valencia became restricted with the arrivals of Patrick Kluivert and David Villa, along with the sacking of Ranieri. New coach Quique Sánchez Flores preferred to use Miguel Ángel Angulo as Villa's strike partner or utilised a 4–5–1 formation, with Villa as the lone frontman. This restricted Di Vaio to only one league start during the 2005–06 season.\n\nIn January 2006, Di Vaio was loaned out to Ligue 1 side AS Monaco with an option to make the deal permanent. Along with Di Vaio, countryman Christian Vieri was also signed and partnered him for 7 French league matches, yielding 3 goals all of which were scored by Vieri. Initially an insurance signing for injured Javier Chevantón and to replace the departing Emmanuel Adebayor, the Italian duo created opportunities for Chevantón to score goals in the second half of the season.\n\nIn his second season Di Vaio became the 3rd choice striker behind new signings Jan Koller and Jérémy Menez, restricting him to just six first team appearances.\n\nOn 22 January 2007, after an unsuccessful spell in Ligue 1, Di Vaio surprisingly returned to Italy by signing with Serie B club Genoa, a side strongly pushing for promotion, for €1.8 million. The club duly achieved promotion, but once in Serie A, the partnership of Marco Borriello and Giuseppe Sculli was preferred, leaving Di Vaio to make only 9 appearances.\n\nOn 21 August 2008 it was confirmed that Di Vaio had signed for Serie A side Bologna FC, recently promoted from Serie B. This reunited with former Genoa teammate Adaílton. Di Vaio was a surprise star in the 2008–09 season, scoring an impressive 24 goals for a mediocre Bologna side. He finished the season as joint second top-scorer alongside Genoa C.F.C. striker Diego Milito. At the end of season Bologna signed him on free transfer.\n\nIn his period at Bologna, Di Vaio regained reputation as a key prolific striker, rapidly becoming a fan favourite, as well as team captain and one of the reference players during the two club takeovers in the 2010–11 season, ensuring himself a contract extension until June 2013; following the announcement, Di Vaio also state his desire to spend the rest of his footballing career as a Bologna player. However, on 4 May 2012, Di Vaio confirmed that the 2011–12 season will be his last with Bologna, and that he would be considering various options for his future.\n\nAfter lengthy negotiations, Montreal Impact announced that Marco Di Vaio had signed as the Canadian club's first Designated Player. Di Vaio made his Impact debut on 27 June 2012 against Toronto FC, and scored his first goal a month later on 28 July 2012 against New York Red Bulls. Marco scored his first goal of the 2014 season against Philadelphia Union on 29 March 2014. On 25 October 2014, in his last game as a professional, Di Vaio scored the opening goal in a 1–1 draw at home to D.C. United. Di Vaio retired following the 2014 season.\n\nDi Vaio made his senior International debut for Italy under manager Giovanni Trapattoni, on 5 September 2001, in a friendly match in Piacenza against Morocco, which ended in a 1–0 home victory to Italy. He scored his first goal for Italy on 11 October 2003, in Reggio Calabria, in a 4–0 home win over Azerbaijan in a UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying match. Di Vaio played for Italy at Euro 2004 under Giovanni Trapattoni, appearing in Italy's final group match, which ended in a 2–1 victory over Bulgaria, although Italy were still eliminated in the first round of the competition. Di Vaio later received several call-ups from Marcello Lippi who had previously coached Di Vaio at Juventus. However, a loss of form whilst with Valencia, coupled with the emergence of Luca Toni and Alberto Gilardino, led to Di Vaio losing his place with the national team. He made his final appearance for Italy with Lippi on 9 October 2004, in a 1–0 away loss to Slovenia, in a 2006 World Cup Qualifying match. In total, Di Vaio appeared 14 times with the national side, scoring two goals.\n\nDi Vaio joined Bologna as club manager after his retirement as a footballer.\n\nA prolific goalscorer, Di Vaio was a quick, opportunistic, and versatile player, who was capable of playing anywhere along the front-line, as a striker, or even as a winger, due to his solid technique and distribution. His preferred role, however, was that of a centre-forward, where he could take advantage of his goalscoring ability in the area and skill in the air. He also had a powerful and accurate shot from distance, and was an accurate penalty taker.\n\nSalernitana\n\nParma\n\nJuventus\n\nValencia\n\nMontreal\n\n\n"}

Debuting with \"Ultra Q\" and then \"Ultraman\" in 1966, the Ultra Series is one of the most prominent tokusatsu superhero genre productions from Japan, along with Toei produced series \"Kamen Rider\", \"Super Sentai\" and the \"Metal Heroes\". The Ultra Series is also one of the most well known examples of the \"daikaiju\" (大怪獣, \"giant monster\") genre, along with Toho's \"Godzilla\" series, and Daiei Film's \"Gamera\" series. However, the Ultra Series also falls into the \"kyodai hīro\" (巨大ヒーロー, \"giant hero\") subgenre of tokusatsu shows.\n\nThe Ultraman brand generated in merchandising revenue from 1966 to 1987, equivalent to more than adjusted for inflation. Ultraman was the world's third top-selling licensed character in the 1980s, largely due to his popularity in Asia. References to Ultraman are popular in Japanese pop culture, much like references to Superman in U.S. culture.\n\nAs revealed in \"\", the Ultramen are a technologically advanced civilization who were originally identical to humans. They had evolved into their current state of being following the activation of the Plasma Spark, which replaced their dead sun. Ultraman and his many kin are usually red-and-silver (although several color variations have been seen in recent years) and have glowing yellow almond-shaped dome eyes (although there are exceptions to both the shape and color) and various abilities, most notably firing energy beams from their crossed hands and flight. They share a strong cultural sense of justice and duty, a majority of Ultramen joining the to maintain peace in the universe from invaders and monsters.\n\nThe Ultramen that are sent to other worlds are given Color Timers, or \"warning lights\", which blink with increasing frequency and turn from blue to red if an Ultraman's energy supply dwindles or he is mortally wounded. Due to human pollution and the light filtering effects of the atmosphere, an Ultraman can remain active on Earth for a limited span of minutes before their energy is depleted and they die. This forces an Ultraman to either assume a human form or merge with a human host body. The latter process has healing properties that include reviving a recently dead person with their own lifeforce.\n\nUltra beings also appear to be near-impossible to permanently kill, as several times an Ultra being has been killed only to be revived by another member of their species. An Ultra being can be revived with a massive energy infusion, as when Mebius' allies revived him with their energy after his defeat by Empire. Ultramen always try to avoid battles in inhabited areas or near innocent bystanders, and try to minimize collateral property damage. If these concerns cannot be met, a city like Tokyo could be destroyed.\n\nThe show \"Ultraman\" was followed by many other series. Sequels to the original series are: \"Ultra Seven\" (1967, TBS), \"The Return of Ultraman\" (1971, TBS), \"Ultraman Ace\" (1972, TBS), \"Ultraman Taro\" (1973, TBS), \"Ultraman Leo\" (1974, TBS), \"Ultraman 80\" (1980, TBS), \"Ultraman Tiga\" (1996, MBS), \"Ultraman Dyna\" (1997, MBS), \"Ultraman Gaia\" (1998, MBS), and \"Ultraman Cosmos\" (2001, MBS). After that the studio tried a reinvention of the hero through the \"Ultra N Project\", which involved three heroes: Ultraman Noa (the \"mascot\" of the Ultra N Project, who appears in stage shows as well as in the final episode of \"Ultraman Nexus\") in late 2003, \"Ultraman Nexus\" (2004, CBC), and \"ULTRAMAN\" (2004, Shochiku Productions). This was followed by a return to the old-school series' style in the form of \"Ultraman Max\" (2005, CBC). In the course of the \"Max\" series, another new hero known as Ultraman Xenon was also introduced. April 2006 saw the 40th anniversary series, \"Ultraman Mebius\", which signalled a long-awaited return to the original universe. Another hero was also introduced: \"Ultraman Hikari\", formerly known as Hunter Knight Tsurugi.\n\nThe franchise has also been in movie theaters, starting with \"Ultraman Zearth\" and \"Ultraman Zearth 2\", \"\", released in 2000, as well as \"ULTRAMAN\", a movie that opened in December 2004. The straight-to-video market also saw the release of \"Ultraman Neos\" in 2000, as well as special features for Ultraman Tiga, Dyna, and Gaia, who have teamed up in theatrical features (Tiga and Dyna once, as well as the three of them all together). The \"Ultraman Mebius and Ultra Brothers\" movie opened in September 2006.\n\nForeign productions include the 1987 Hanna-Barbera co-production \"\" (in Japanese, \"Ultraman USA\"), an animated movie; \"\" (in Japanese, \"Ultraman Great\"), an Australian 1991 production and \"\" (in Japanese, \"Ultraman Powered\"), produced in the United States in 1993. The Ultraman series have also been dubbed into various languages, including English, Spanish (only \"Ultra Q\", the original \"Ultraman\", \"Ultra Seven\", \"Return of Ultraman\", \"Ultraman Great\" and \"Ultraman Tiga\" were known to be translated into Spanish), Portuguese (\"Ultraman\", \"Ultra Seven\", \"Return of Ultraman\" and \"Ultraman Tiga\" in Brazil), Korean, Malay, Mandarin, Indonesian, Cantonese and Filipino (\"Ultraman\", \"Ultra Seven\", \"Return of Ultraman\", \" Ultraman Taro\", \"Ultraman Tiga\", \"Ultraman Dyna\", \"Ultraman Gaia\", \"Ultraman Nexus\", \"Ultraman Max\" and \"Ultraman Mebius\"). Also of note is the American English dub of \"Ultraman Tiga\" by 4Kids Entertainment that aired in 2002. The dub considerably distorted the characterization and general mood of the series, and it achieved only limited success.\n\nIn 1993, Tsuburaya Productions and Toei Company co-produced \"Ultraman vs. Kamen Rider,\" a crossover with the original Ultraman and Toei's \"Kamen Rider\". This direct-to-video feature is co-copyrighted by both Toei (and its subordinates, Toei Video and Ishinomori Productions) and Tsuburaya Productions.\n\n, Tsuburaya Productions accepts 36 Ultramen as official (counting Ultraman Legend, the combined form of Ultramen Cosmos and Justice, as a separate entity). This figure does not account for Thai-produced Ultramen (the figure is 38 if Next, Noa, and Nexus are counted as separate entities—it has been revealed in \"Nexus\" that all three are a single being with various modes used by different hosts). In 2013, the Ultra Series was cited in the Guinness Book of World Records as the record-holder for the most number of spinoff shows. The Ultraman brand generated $7.4 billion in merchandising revenue from 1966 to 1987, equivalent to more than adjusted for inflation. Ultraman was the world's third top-selling licensed character in the 1980s, largely due to his popularity in Asia.\n\nIn 2017, \"\" and \"\" were released on January 8, 2017 in the United States as a double feature; this was the first North American theatrical release of an Ultraman feature film in its entire 50-year history. \"Ultraman Max\", \"Ultraman 80\", \"Ultraman Neos\", \"Ultraman Nexus\", \"Ultraseven X\", \"The Ultraman\" and other series began airing in the United States on the TOKU channel.\n\nThe \"Ultraman\" manga, which began in 2011, has sold more than 2.8million copies as of 2018. At the Tokyo Comic Con on December 7, 2017, Tsuburaya Productions revealed that an anime adaptation of the manga was planned for release in 2019. It was released by Netflix.\n\nPeyton Reed, the director of the \"Ant-Man\" films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, said that Ant-Man's costume design was influenced by Ultraman, along with another tokusatsu superhero, Inframan.\n\nIt was announced in November 2019 that Marvel Comics has partnered with Tsuburaya Productions to publish Ultraman comic books in 2020.\n\nAlthough the different Ultra series and movies take place in different continuities, that does not mean that they take place in different canons. A major plot aspect of the Ultra Series is the multiverse, which is a collection of countless bubble-shaped universes. This was first hinted at in \"Ultraman Tiga\", and then again in \"Ultraman Dyna\", when the title character gets sucked into a wormhole that transports him throughout the multiverse. The multiverse was first glimpsed in the 2010 film \"\" when Ultraman Zero has to travel through it in order to get to his destination. The multiverse has become a bigger and bigger element of the plot over time, and the Ultras are now often seen traveling through the multiverse. In fact, the 2012 film \"Ultraman Saga\" takes place in four different universes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1998 \"Ultra Seven: 30th Anniversary Memorial Trilogy\" series\n\n\n1999 \"Ultra Seven: The Final Chapters\" series\n\n\n2001 Heisei Ultraman side stories\n\n\n2002 \"Ultra Seven: EVOLUTION\" series\n\n\n2007 Ultraman Mebius side story: \"Hikari Saga\"\n\n\n2008 Ultraman Mebius side story: \"Armored Darkness\"\n\n\n2009 Ultraman Mebius side story: \"Ghost Reverse\"\n\n\n2010 \n\n\n2011 Ultraman Zero side story: \"Killer the Beatstar\"\n\n\n\n\nIn Japan, there have been several box sets that were released which would each contain a particular Ultra series. As of now, there are only four such box sets. The sets were released as part of the Digital Ultra movement where the shows would be re-released with digital remastering.\n\nThe following are the series which have been released as such:\n\nThe \"Digital Ultra\" re-release order of the series may not match the chronological order in which they were originally aired in Japan.\n\nUltraman's licensing rights outside Japan have been the subject of a prolonged legal dispute between Tsuburaya Productions and Chaiyo Productions (also called Tsuburaya Chaiyo Co. Ltd) based in Thailand. Tsuburaya had previously collaborated with Chaiyo on the production of two movies, \"The 6 Ultra Brothers vs. the Monster Army\" and \"Jumborg Ace & Giant\"—the latter of which featured another Tsuburaya superhero, Jumborg Ace—in 1974. Sompote Saengduenchai, founder/president of Chaiyo Productions, claimed and maintained that in 1976 that Noboru Tsuburaya, the son of the late Eiji Tsuburaya, had given him and his company a contract which had given him rights to everything Ultraman outside Japanese territories in exchange for a monetary loan. \n\nIn spite of the fact that the document failed to state clearly and specifically exactly what had been given to Tsuburaya in exchange for these rights, Japanese and Thai courts accepted this contract as real and binding because of the supposed hanko of the late Noboru Tsuburaya, who had died in 1995, in the document. Tsuburaya Productions insisted and maintained that the contract was a forgery (due to factual errors, including the faulty titles of the series in the document, such as \"Ultra Q\" being called \"\"Ultraman 1: Ultra Q\"\", \"Ultra Seven\" being called \"\"Ultraman 3: Ultraman Seven\"\", and Tsuburaya Productions being called \"Tsuburaya Prod. and Enterprises\", a name the company never did business under), and repeatedly contested the issue.\n\nIn the course of the legal battle, Sompote presented photos of himself sharing his photos of Thai Buddhist edifices stating that Eiji had based Ultraman's face on those edifices, a claim which he has continued to hold since the dispute began. No other evidence supporting this claim was known to exist.\n\nAfter an eight-year battle in the courts of both countries, Sompote Saengduenchai was awarded a favorable decision on April 27, 2004. The exact ruling fell into some dispute: Some said it only gave him merchandising rights for the first six Ultra Series (\"Ultra Q\" through \"Ultraman Taro\") and \"Jumborg Ace\" outside Japan, and broadcasting rights of those shows within Thailand. Other accounts, usually reported in the Thai/Asian media, said that Chaiyo had gained the rights to those six shows everywhere outside Japan. The latter could be taken as Chaiyo's side of the story, as Tsuburaya was reported in the Japanese media to continue taking further action against them.\n\nTsuburaya decided not to market any of the disputed six Ultra Series outside Japan until it had completely settled the rights issues with Chaiyo, although the company continued to merchandise and distribute all of the Ultraman programs created after \"Ultraman Taro\", including the theatrical feature \"Ultraman the Next\", throughout the world. Because of the copyright struggle, importing literature on Ultraman into Singapore and Malaysia was prohibited. It also resulted in a slight backlash against Thai Ultraman fans, who were assumed to be outright Chaiyo supporters.\n\nIn 2005 the American company BCI Home Entertainment (BCI/Eclipse), a subsidiary of Navarre Corporation announced they had acquired the DVD license to \"Ultraman\" from distributor Golden Media Group Inc., a Hollywood-based distributor, who secured the rights from Tokyo-based UM Corp. Inc., acting as the global agent for Chaiyo. A three-disc box set containing the first 20 episodes of the series was released on July 18, 2006, followed by a second three-disc box set containing the remaining 19 episodes was released on November 7, 2006. Both sets feature the Japanese stereo audio, created by Tsuburaya Productions and Pioneer for their Japanese R-2 DVD release in 1999, as well as the English-dubbed version produced by United Artists for North American syndication. The original Japanese monaural was not included. \n\nUnfortunately, the English audio for Episodes 5 through 39 were not all complete, as BCI sourced private home off-air audio recordings from an unknown television broadcast, which were cut to provide for more commercial time. Therefore, the episodes in question would switch to Japanese audio from English audio to cover the missing gaps. Due to these gaps, BCI's publicity department assumed the original series was edited by UA-TV when it was originally prepared for US syndication. Only minor seconds of extreme violence were trimmed from three episodes, none of which contained dialogue. Tsuburaya Productions had a complete run of the UA-TV's version, which their Los Angeles Office, UltraCom Inc., retrieved from a US film warehouse in 1993. In 1994, they provided the English audio for the Expressions in Animation VHS release of the first four episodes, which were sourced for the corresponding episodes in the BCI release.\n\nDuring the time of the legal battle, Chaiyo came up with three of their own Ultras: Ultraman Millennium, Dark Ultraman (an evil Ultra), and Ultraman Elite. These were not used for purposes other than stage shows and merchandise. Chaiyo also created a TV series that he called \"Project Ultraman\", un-aired as of late March 2008, a joint project in China featuring their own Ultraman and attaching Hong Kong star, Ekin Cheng to the project.\n\nOn August 23, 2006, Tsuburaya Productions filed a new lawsuit against Chaiyo for copyright infringement and plagiarism (concerning their three original Ultraman characters), and the court case was taken to China. The Chinese courts in Beijing opened \"The Ultraman Copyright Study Group\" in response to the lawsuit. In April 2007, the Thailand Intellectual Property Court ruled in favor of Tsuburaya Productions, ordering Chaiyo to cease and desist making commercial profits from Chaiyo-produced Ultraman characters such as Millennium, Dark, and Elite. The defendants were also fined THB 15,000,000 (approx. JPY 50,904,959 or US$428,673.50 c. April 2007) plus interest and attorneys' fees. \"Project Ultraman\" went on hiatus as a result of the ruling, which implied that, although Chaiyo owned the right to some of the Ultraman series, it did not own the right to Ultraman and his brothers, including the design. Chaiyo gained permission to merchandise the original series, but lost the right to create and market its own Ultraman, or even use the original, without Tsuburaya's consent.\n\nOn February 5, 2008, Thailand's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Tsuburaya Productions of Japan after they made an appeal to the initial ruling. The ruling ended the long legal battle by finding Sompote Saengduenchai was not a co-creator of Ultraman. The decision ended Sompote's bid to continue his enterprise, and the court gave Sompote 30 days to stop profiteering from Ultraman. The final ruling saw Tsuburaya Productions as the sole copyright owner. Sompote was also required to pay THB 10,700,000 plus interest at the rate of 7.5 per cent a year starting from December 16, 1997, when the original lawsuit was filed.\n\nIn 2009, the Thai Intellectual Property Court and the Tokyo District Court both ruled in favour of the Thai company. This led to the Tokyo District Court on September 30, 2010, ordering Tsuburaya Productions Co of Japan to pay damages of 16.36 million yen (Bt5.9 million) to Sompote Saengduenchai of Thailand for violating his overseas copyrights on Ultraman characters.\n\nAfter the announcement of the \"\" movie in July 2017, the dispute on the ownership of the franchise has escalated. But in November 20, 2017, through a Los Angeles court ruling by judge Judge Andre Birotte Jr, Tsuburaya won the lawsuit against Chaiyo and affiliate groups on the rights of the series after the jury concluded that the supposed agreement between Noboru Tsuburaya and Chaiyo was \"not authentic\". Despite UM Corporation and Chaiyo filing a counter-dispute, on April 18, 2018, the legal court came to a definite close where a final judgement states that the dispute and the document was deemed invalid, forbidding UMC to use the Ultra Series and all its related characters and forced them to pay Tsubaraya damages for its infringement of its rights.\n\nWith the release of the sequel film Dragon Force: Rise of Ultraman (), issues between UMC, Bluearc and Tsubaraya had reignited and the company took legal actions against the two companies again. In December 10, 2019, it was confirmed by Tsuburaya that the court has rejected UMC and Bluearc's appeal for a retrial, stating the court's first verdict of regarding the rights and ownership of Ultraman to Tsuburaya is still legitimate and final, and that any future appeals by UMC and Bluearc will likely be rejected. As UMC and Bluearc failed to file a further appeal by March 4, 2020, they were to pay US$4,000,000 (approx. 400,000,000 Japanese Yen) in compensatory damages as well as other various court fees.\n\nOn March 6, 2014, the Malaysian Ministry of Home Affairs announced that it had banned the publication of an \"Ultraman\" comic book \"Ultraman: The Ultra Power\" \"due to contents that were detrimental to public order\". Social media users later noticed that a page in the book described the character of Ultraman King (from the film \"\") as a god, which in the Malaysian pidgin language Bahasa Rojak is the Arabic word \"Allah\". The Home Ministry later confirmed that the use of \"Allah\" was indeed the reason for the ban, claiming that the comparison may \"confuse Muslim children and damage their faith\". This highlighted the larger ban to prevent non-Muslims in Malaysia from using the word \"Allah\" despite its common usage in the Malaysian pidgin to refer to any \"god\", as well as a suit from the Catholic Church of Malaysia over its usage.\n\n"}

It is the homeland of the Arab tribe of the Manasir and from them gets its name. Still today the water rapids cannot be crossed by any large boats making the region accessible only via a sandy and rocky desert track.\n\nAt the height of the Island of Muqrat (N 19°30') the Nile river is blocked from its northward course taking a sharp turn SSW for 280 kilometres before continuing to flow north. In the middle of this S-shape between the Bayudah Desert to the south and the Nubian Desert to the north, the Nile is forced by the topography to split up into a multitude of tributaries forming a fertile river oasis of small rocky islands described by the traveller GRAY (1949:120) with the following words: \"\"Whereas usually [agriculture] in the Nile Valley […] is confined to the belt on two banks on which the river has deposited silt, in this cataract area, where islands are scattered like a flock of goats, the number of silt-covered river banks in any given 10 kilometres may be up to a dozen\"\".\n\nDar al-Manasir will be successively flooded by the Merowe Dam project.\n\nDar al-Manasir is confined by the upstream living Rubatab tribe () in the area of \"Abu Hamed\" () (E 33.18°) and the downstream Shaiqiyah tribe () past the village of \"Birti\" (E 32.15°), (cf. LAGNAH 2005:2). Dar al-Manasir is covering a distance of approximately 130 km along the Nile with most villages lined up along the left river bank called \"Western side\" (…). But the heart of Dar al-Manasir consists of 14 islands, twelve of them permanently inhabited; \"al-Qanaweit\" (), \"Shiri\" (), \"Kidir\" (), \"Sherari\" (), \"Sur\" (), \"Us\" (), \"Tibit\" (…), \"Dumag\" (), \"Buni\" (), \"Arag\" (), \"Dirbi\" () and \"Birti\" (), (cf. SALIH 1999:8, LAGNAH 2005:2).\n\nThe climate is arid with an annual rainfall of about 50 mm in good years. The exact amount and spatial distribution of the precipitation during the rainy season in the months of August until October is highly variable and therefore unpredictable. The rainy season coincides with the flood season of the Nile (cf. SALIH 1999:9).\n\nThe Manasir pursue small scale agriculture in the immediate vicinity of the Nile. Tiny pockets of alluvial sediments and the seasonally inundated riverside land are intensively irrigated and cultivated. The most important cash crops of the region are dates (cf. Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir). During good rainy seasons, in which grazing grounds are abundant, many male Manasir join members of their tribe in the adjacent Bayudah Desert.\n\nPolitically Dar al-Manasir belongs to the River Nile state ( \"Wilāya nahr an-Nīl\"). The administrative centre with the only local run police station, branch of the Agricultural Bank and Secondary Schools for both sexes is \"Shiri\" () on Shiri Island.\n\nDar al-Manasir is among the most neglected areas in Northern Sudan. Apart from basic educational institutions virtually no public infrastructure such as tarred roads, bridges or ferry boats and hospitals exist. But the Manasir are also aware of advantages of this situation and describe them in terms of exceptional safety and honesty (), tranquillity (), untainted beauty of their country () and cleanness of the water which they drink straight out of the Nile. The landscape, described by Innes (1931:184) as \"\"most barren and the most beautiful\"\" along the Nile, is rocky, picturesque and referred by the inhabitants happily as \"\"our rocks\"\" ().\n\nDar al-Manasir with all its villages and agricultural land will be successively flooded in the coming months by the Merowe Dam project. Its residents are going to be moved, but the exact relocation area is still not clear and a matter of ongoing discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Imagining a black space program, whose \"blackstronauts\" were excluded from \"White NASA\", the film lampoons Burns's history of the Negro Leagues, a subject of his 1994 series, \"Baseball\".\n\nThe ten-minute film was produced and directed by Andy Bobrow, who wrote for the television series \"Hype\", \"Malcolm in the Middle\" and later, \"Community\". Bobrow later went on to write the \"Community\" episode \"Pillows and Blankets\", another parody of Ken Burns.\n\nIt was created for broad release on the Internet. It was nominated for a 2005 Nebula Award but was ruled ineligible because the film \"did not meet the requirement of professional release, or the 12 month period for nomination (after professional release) expired prior to the film receiving enough nominations to be placed on the ballot.\" The SFWA stated that the disqualification in no way reflected on the work's quality.\n\nTo impress a girl that he likes, Wallace \"Suitcase\" Jefferson applies for a job at the newly formed NASA. Unfortunately, since America's \"love affair with racism was in full swing\", Jefferson learns that NASA is whites-only. Undaunted, Jefferson and his friend \"Loopie\" Louie Hays form their own astronaut group. Their creation—the Negro American Space Society of Astronauts (NASSA)—is a resounding success, with more than 240 \"blackstronauts\" signing up by 1960. The venture also brings personal success to Jefferson—he wins the girl's heart and later marries her.\n\nUsing spaceships cobbled together from old rocket engines, landing capsules, a school bus, and a used Cadillac, NASSA quickly becomes a major player in the space race. Its members farm out across the country, barnstorming in small towns to raise money and becoming minor celebrities. In Washington, the US government worries about losing the space race to the Soviet Union, but is \"ten times as worried\" about losing the race to NASSA.\n\nLike NASA, NASSA suffers some significant setbacks. Sullivan Carew dies a hero's death when his rocket-powered school bus burns up in the atmosphere, while Peter \"Stinky Pete\" Carver catches fire in an Illinois church parking lot. Unlike NASA, however, the blackstronauts refuse to slow the pace of their program (Stinky Pete is extinguished and makes another launch the following day).\n\nThe film features a letter from Sullivan Carew to his wife written two days before his death. It is a parody of the real-life letter by Union Army soldier Sullivan Ballou, which was used by Ken Burns in his documentary \"The Civil War\".\n\nNASA attempts to lure away those members of NASSA who have light skin and can pass as white, including Gordon Cooper and Buzz Aldrin. When this fails to produce the desired effect, the government issues a \"black blackout\" and forces the mainstream media to focus only on negative issues affecting the black community. Soon the newspapers are full of stories about crime and riots, and the achievements of NASSA go unreported.\n\nOn September 31, 1966, Suitcase Jefferson and Louie Hayes land their rocket-powered Coupe de Ville on the surface of the Moon and return safely to Earth. Their amazing feat is buried by the black blackout, and appears on page 34 of the \"Cincinnati Enquirer\" (and, presumably, gets the same treatment in other papers). The article reads as follows:\n\nSaddened by the nation's lack of interest in their heroics, Jefferson and his friends decide to shut down NASSA.\n\n\nThe following members of NASSA were shown or named in the film:\n\n"}

However, the name did not obscure the fact that Japan's form of government was more akin to an aristocratic oligarchy.\n\nIn World War I, Japan fought alongside the Allied Powers. In 1915, Japan presented their Twenty-One Demands to China. The demands used the war as a pretense for gaining additional territorial holdings in China. When the United States entered the war in 1917, Japan signed the Lansing–Ishii Agreement, which prevented interference with the Open Door Policy that allowed all nations to engage in commerce with China. With the allied victory over the Central Powers, Japan gained many German possessions in China, including the Shandong Peninsula. Japan also received the South Pacific Mandate from the League of Nations (a precursor to the United Nations) and also actively used the mandate to gain control over various islands in the South Pacific. Japan used economic development and immigration to push their expansionary goals as an empire.\n\nThis period of time is widely known as the \"reconciliation period,\" during which great riots occurred (e.g., the Rice Revolution of 1918–19), menacing the dominion of government gangs.\n\nIn 1918, Hara Takashi, the leader of the conservative party Seiyūkai, assumed the position of Prime Minister. He was the first person of modest origins to take this role, and his success was taken as a good sign by Western observers. His success ultimately diminished the power of the feudal government's elder statesmen (Genro) and military leaders. The 1920 elections supported Hara, but Hara was assassinated by a fanatic on 4 November 1921. His Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo was then made party president and Prime Minister, serving for seven months before resigning. Two Genro members then dictated the election of Admiral Katō Tomosaburō as the new Prime Minister.\n\nKato represented Japan at the Washington Naval Conference (1921–1922), at which the Allied powers made an agreement fixing the proportional number of battleships that each could possess: five for the United States, five for England, and three for Japan. The Allies compensated Japan with a four-power pact, giving Japan the right of unlimited land armaments without restrictions and protection against Western intervention in East Asia. Kato's program strictly followed the Washington accords, which meant a guarantee of unrestrained Japanese action in the East at the expense of a relatively inferior naval position.\n\nKato's death in 1923, followed by a terrible earthquake that devastated Japan in the same year, made a necessary reorganization and reconstruction of the nation's damaged economy. At this time, one independent party was formed while the following governments included moderate elements. But in 1927, this short liberal period ended when Baron Giichi Tanaka—leader of the Seiyūkai, a minority party in the Diet—rose to power.\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Army was impatient for control of the Diet while the political class was anxious to gain power over industrial expansion; previously, the rotation of parties in power had permitted each party a turn at benefiting from generous contracts and corruption, leading to an informal accord between them. A whole sequence of scandals, however, led to an appreciation of the Imperial Army's National Feudal Honour Code (\"Bushi-Do\", the War Code), as a bulwark against the fraudulent politics of the traditional parties.\n\nThe more moderate elements, meeting to form the Minseito democratic party, presented a challenge to the military. In 1930, the Minseito Party obtained a decisive majority in the Diet: 273, against 174 for the military followers. Minseito fielded two prime ministers, Osachi Hamaguchi, who was already serving as prime minister since July 2, 1929, and Wakatsuki Reijiro, who took over after Hamaguchi retired due to wounds from an assassination attempt (which occurred earlier on 14 November 1930). Wakatsuki retired on 13 December 1931 after he could no longer control the army in Manchuria. The Seiyukai Party then took control, installing Inukai Tsuyoshi as Prime Minister.\n\nThe world situation remained unsettled, causing some effects in Japan, which remained in a heavy-industrial crisis. Needing to display some drastic action, the military decided to invade Manchuria. One of the military's principal motives was to eliminate the rising spirit of social criticism and insecurity. In 1925, universal suffrage for men was granted, which led to the formation of the Laborists and the Peasant Party. There were more liberals and radicals in the universities. Very few of them accepted the religious myth about the Mikado as the descendant of eternal ages of Amaterasu Omikami and the religious paraphernalia related to Emperor worship. These Japanese were more modern in their viewpoints on the economy, politics, science, and Western ideas; the militarists and their supporters said they upheld \"pernicious and dangerous ideas.\"\n\nIn reality, power passed to General Sadao Araki, a military man with feudal ideas profoundly hostile to Western civilization. During his administration, the police reprisals and prosecutions of independent and advanced thinkers were reminiscent of the days of Tsarism in Imperial Russia. A large proportion of the intellectual class was detained while books and newspapers were reduced to the authoritarian formula.\n\nAt the same time in 1931, with some guerrilla opposition, the Japanese conquest of Manchuria succeeded without difficulties. Later, this success and the collapse of organized resistance gained much sympathy for the reactionaries and Nationalists, and in the next elections they defeated the moderates by a majority of two to one.\n\nIn a display of political mockery of the Chinese Kuomintang revolution, Japan installed the last Manchu emperor of China, Puyi, as the regent for Manchukuo. China reported what they saw as \"Japanese aggression\" to the League of Nations. The report of the Lytton Commission created to investigate the incident condemned the Japanese action in Manchuria, motivating the Japanese to declare Manchukuo \"independent\". The report declared that Manchukuo remained part of China, but several other countries granted it diplomatic recognition as an independent state before World War II. In February 1933, when the findings of the Report were announced, the Japanese delegation walked out of the League of Nations; Japan gave formal notice of its withdrawal on March 27, 1933.\n\nThe real drivers of this movement were the generals of the Autonomous Kwantung Army. They applied pressure to have the oldest diplomat in Japan, Prince Saionji, nominated to the Inukai. In the wake of the electoral triumph a wave of political assassinations plagued the nation, aimed largely at ministers still in the cabinet who displayed some independence. In March 1932 ex-minister Inouye and Baron Takuma Dan, a leader of the banking interest Mitsui and one of the most powerful financial figures in Japan, were killed by shooting. These crimes were actions of the Brotherhood of Blood League, formed by a fanatical lieutenant and a Buddhist priest. This and other secret groups, particularly the Black Dragon Society of Mitsuru Toyama, were attractive to the sons of discarded citizens, small merchants and industrialists left to ruin by the great zaibatsus. Their embittered descendants became the backbone of the Japanese Army, many of their officers being of lower rank than the Zaibatsu families. This Radical movement took its ideas from Fascism, combined with right wing socialist elements. It hated the plutocracy but believed in rights for labor and a severely militarized state with strong controls over commercial monopolies and a hierarchical system, leading to the imperial conquest of vast new territories, providing wealth and successful careers for its members. The Assassins of the Brotherhood of Blood are aided, and receiving only some cases. The terror reached its highest point with the assassination of the leader of the Seiyukai, Prime Minister Inukai. This caused industrial concentration and supported monopolies, which raised large sums from loans to obtain the resources for factories and military industries, which rationalized their processes to reduce the low costs of Japanese production.\n\nHowever, the farming situation still continued to be in danger. The taxes on peasants increased significantly while industrialists received economic bonuses. To prevent open rebellion in rural areas, the government allowed some 5,500,000 farmers to organize farming cooperatives as a method of containing their resentment.\n\nThe Choshu Clan dominated the Army and Satsuma managed the Navy. The unique form of reconciling the claims of older members of Choshu Clan with new elements of the new clan are extended the imperialists conquests in form. But the raising of nationalist consciousness in China and one perspective of united and patriotic China, appearing how one serious menace to any expansion why the militarists and ind considered important.\n\nThe Soviet Union was frequently provoked by the Japanese from 1929 to 1939, but most particularly since 1931 when the Japanese conquered Manchuria. During the 1929 successes, the Japanese blocked the China Eastern Railway en route to Vladivostok. In 1935, the Russians sold this railway to Japan.\n\nThen the Soviets raised an industrial center east of Lake Baikal, to augment the railways to Pacific areas. The Soviets also defeated the Japanese in various frontier skirmishes (1929–39). The Russians had an autonomous army in the far east for safeguarding their territory against the Kwantung Army.\n\nIn 1932, Admiral Saitō Makoto and War Minister General Araki formed one government with no political parties. Admiral Keisuke Okada succeeded Saito as Prime Minister, continuing the revocation of moderate policy in 1920 when they denounced the then-unpopular Washington Naval Treaty.\n\nThe Japanese continued to increase their diplomatic pressures over China. The Emperor of Manchukuo gave Henry Puyi the title of Kang Ten; and commenced their advance in North China, threatening Peking and Tientsin. Hostilities began in 1932, with one attack on Shanghai, but the Tanggu Truce (1933) between Japan and China fixed a demilitarized zone at the south of the Great Wall were the Chinese prohibited stationed troops.\n\nIn 1934, the Japanese challenged China with a sovereign demand over North China, which included Japanese advisers in the Chinese central government. With these successes, the Japanese government called for general elections in 1936. Despite strong police suppression of \"dangerous ideas,\" the most moderate party, Minseito, defeated the government with a vote of 205 to 124, and they also gained support from the Labor party. The extremist Militarist party, supported by the Fascists, elected 20 members, or 15% of Diet.\n\nSix days after the elections, there was a wave of political assassinations in Japan. Among the victims were Admiral Saito, Viscount Takahashi, General Jōtarō Watanabe. Prime Minister Okada was saved when one of the assassins confused him for another person. The Emperor was alarmed at the magnitude of these actions.\n\nThe army, concerned about losing control, reorganized itself. Kōki Hirota became Prime Minister, but the Army controlled the War Ministerium. Hirota knew why the Chinese situation would wait no longer. The Manchukuo disillusionment over the economical needs of Japan, still with their railway developed, establishing petrol and coal monopolies and some intents of colonization, the Japanese buying of Soviet Russia of East Chinese Railway, and other developments. But the double way in Soviet line in the Trans-Siberian Railway, and industrial expansion in the Far East and Siberia meant Japan had to go into debt in order to maintain a presence on the Russian frontier.\n\nThe fight against \"bandits\" had a cost in money and lives, maintain for all these country in virtual disorder situation how times of the \"warlord\" Chang Tso-lin before at 1928. Diplomatic pressures of Prime Minister Hirota over China caused the Militarists to overthrow him in 1936.\n\nJapan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact in November 1936, becoming an ally of Germany. The treaty, a provocation to the Soviets, added to a number of incidents between Japan and Russia and Senjūrō Hayashi formed a right-wing government. In the 1937 elections, the Japanese electorate indicated its opposition to expansionism. The government then abolished elections, and Fumimaro Konoe formed a government on May 31, 1937.\n\nIn July 1937 Prime Minister Konoe began open hostilities against China which escalated into a full-scale, undeclared war the following month. The Japanese called it the \"Chinese Incident\" to downplay their invasion. In October 1937, Konoe approved the National Mobilization Law.\n\nSince 1935, Japanese leaders had declared the country's intention to establish \"a new order in Asia\". China wanted to replace Chiang Kai-shek, and Western interests wanted the Soviets to retreat west of Lake Baikal. The Japanese government and the military proposed the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Despite efforts to \"put ... the aggressor in quarantine\" (as Franklin D. Roosevelt said in Chicago in October 1937), the \"USS Panay\" (an American river-patrol boat) was deliberately sunk by Japanese Navy dive bombers in the Yangtze River (1938).\n\nTwo Japanese incursions were made into Soviet territory during the spring of 1938 and 1939: the Battle of Lake Khasan and the Manchurian-Mongolian; both were Japanese defeats. More right-wing activity began when Hiranuma Kiichirō became prime minister and the August 23, 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact rattled Japanese diplomacy. Nobuyuki Abe became prime minister, and the United States denounced the defunct Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Mitsumasa Yonai succeeded Abe as prime minister. In turn, Fumimaro Konoe succeeded Yonai as prime minister and formed a totalitarian, right-wing government in July 1940.\n\nOn September 27, 1940 Japan signed the Tripartite Pact, primarily directed against the United States. Foreign Minister Yōsuke Matsuoka, who withdrew Japan from the League of Nations in 1933, engineered the April 13, 1941 Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact. Special envoy Saburō Kurusu and Japanese ambassador to the United States Kichisaburō Nomura attempted to negotiate peace in Washington weeks before the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese were initially successful in the Pacific and Southeast Asia, sinking the Royal Navy's \"Prince of Wales\" and the \"Repulse\" three days after Pearl Harbor, invading the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Malaya and Burma and threatening northern Australia and eastern India.\nHideki Tojo had become prime minister on October 17, 1941; before his replacement by Kuniaki Koiso on July 22, 1944 the war had turned against Japan in the summer of 1943, except for some aspects of the Chinese campaign.\n\n"}
{"id": "2005860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2005860", "title": "3rd Colorado Cavalry Regiment", "text": "3rd Colorado Cavalry Regiment\n\nThe Third Colorado Cavalry was formed in the mid-1860s when increased traffic on the United States emigrant trails and settler encroachment resulted in numerous attacks against them by the Cheyenne and Arapaho. The Hungate massacre and the display in Denver of mutilated victims raised political pressure for the government to protect its people. Governor John Evans sought and gained authorization from the War Department in Washington to found the Third. More a militia than a military unit, the \"Bloodless Third\" was composed of \"100-daysers,\" that is, volunteers who signed on for 100 days to fight against the Indians. (Its nickname came from its lack of battle experience.)\n\nThe unit's only commander was Col. George L. Shoup, a politician from Colorado. The regiment was assigned to the District of Colorado commanded by Col. John M. Chivington.\n\nAt the Camp Weld Council of September 28, 1864, Evans and Chivington met with five chiefs, including Black Kettle of the Cheyenne and White Antelope of the Arapaho. They had been brought to Denver to parlay for peace under military escort by Major Edward W. Wynkoop, commander of Fort Lyon. The chiefs agreed to peacefully settle their people on the reservation on Big Sandy Creek about 40 miles northwest of Fort Lyon. The reservation was created under the Fort Wise Treaty of 1860. With Wynkoop's assuring their safety, the chiefs settled their bands in a large village at the curve of Sand Creek. Some Indians set up lodges closer to Fort Lyon.\n\nOn November 5, Major Wynkoop was removed from command and replaced by an ally of Chivington, Major Scott Anthony. He ordered all Indians camped around the fort to the reservation. On November 26, Wynkoop departed for reassignment to Fort Riley, Kansas.\n\nOn November 28, Chivington arrived at Fort Lyon, having traveled in great secrecy with 700 Third Colorado Cavalry and a battalion of the First Colorado Cavalry. Encouraged by Governor Evans and spurred by his own ambitions, Chivington felt pressure to use the \"Bloodless Third\" before the volunteers' terms expired. He sealed off the fort. Officers loyal to Wynkoop were held at gunpoint. That night, reinforced by artillery from the fort and 125 troops of the First Cavalry, Chivington set off for the Cheyenne-Arapaho village at Sand Creek.\n\nArriving at dawn on November 29, 1864, the volunteer militia attacked. Although Black Kettle had flown an American flag on his tipi to signal peace (as directed by Wynkoop), the volunteers killed indiscriminately. Historians have not agreed on the number killed, but they often cite 150, mostly women and children, as the warriors had gone out on a hunt. The militia mutilated some of the corpses, taking body parts as souvenirs.\n\nNow called the \"Bloody Third,\" the regiment returned to Denver in December. It mustered out on December 31, 1864. For months the men displayed the body parts as trophies in Denver saloons. Although Chivington and his forces were lauded by many at the time for a heroic \"battle,\" critics complained about the military conduct of the men.\n\nIn his autobiographical \"Memories of a Lifetime in the Pike's Peak Region\", Irving Howbert, an 18-year-old cavalryman who was later one of the founders of Colorado Springs, defended Chivington, having argued instead that the Indian women and children were not attacked, but a few who did not leave the camp were killed once the fighting began. He claimed that the number of warriors in the village was about equal to the force of the Colorado cavalry. Chivington, claimed Howbert, was retaliating for Indian attacks on wagon trains and settlements in Colorado and for the torture and the killings of citizens during the preceding three years. Howbert said the evidence of the previous Indian attacks on the settlers was shown by their confiscation of \"more than a dozen scalps of white people, some of them from the heads of women and children.\"\n\nHowbert claimed that the account of the battle to the United States Congress made by Lieutenant Col. Samuel F. Tappan was inaccurate. He accused Tappan of giving a false view of the battle because Tappan and Chivington had been military rivals.\n\nThe US Congress investigated the attack. The hearings were widely covered, leading to national shock and outrage about the brutality of the attack and the betrayal of promises made to the Cheyenne and Arapaho. Because the Native Americans believed the Cheyenne had been targeted by the US, major Sioux and Arapaho bands allied with them from 1865 on to attack the \"Vehos\" (whites) and try to drive emigrant settlers out of their lands.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2005866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2005866", "title": "British Invasion (comics)", "text": "British Invasion (comics)\n\nThe British Invasion is a term referring to a group of British writers who rose to prominence in the late 1980s while working on American comic books. The movement was most strongly associated with Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, Grant Morrison, and Peter Milligan, all writers who had previously worked on the British comic anthology series \"2000 AD\" and who were subsequently recruited by DC Comics. These writers were seen as having a new and different sensibility to their predecessors in American comics.\n\nCharacteristics of the British Invasion included a greater sensitivity to language, more mature storylines, and a move away from the superhero genre. The invasion led DC Comics to create the Vertigo imprint to target the mature audiences of these writers.\n\nPrior to the start of the British Invasion, DC Comics had imported several British artists from the early 1980s to work on their comic books. Brian Bolland was at the vanguard of this influx. Others that followed included Dave Gibbons, Brendan McCarthy, Glenn Fabry, Steve Dillon, and Philip Bond.\n\nThe British Invasion itself is often cited as occurring in the wake of Alan Moore's successful run on \"Swamp Thing\" and his \"Watchmen\" series. After Moore had a falling-out with DC and swore never to work for them again, DC editor (later Vertigo Group Editor) Karen Berger recruited many promising writers (and artists) from the UK. The names primarily associated with the invasion include Jamie Delano, who was approached by DC as the writer of the Swamp Thing spin off \"Hellblazer\"; Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean, who collaborated on the \"Black Orchid\" limited series, as well as the famous and acclaimed \"Sandman\"; Peter Milligan, who launched a new \"Shade, the Changing Man\" series; and Scottish creator Grant Morrison, whose pitch of an \"Animal Man\" series was approved. Later British creators to work on American comics include Warren Ellis, Garth Ennis and Paul Jenkins.\n\nWhile some \"British\" writers such as Chris Claremont (Claremont was born in England but spent all of his adult life in the United States) had already worked for American comic companies prior to Alan Moore, they are not associated with the British Invasion. One of the chief characteristics of the British Invasion group of writers that set them apart from others was their greater sensitivity to language. Before the British Invasions, writers in the American comic book industry were known as \"ace storytellers but mediocre wordsmiths\" because the \"actual text\" of their comic books were generally subordinate to the plot and storytelling. With his work on \"Swamp Thing\", Alan Moore revolutionised the American comic book industry through his use of \"precise, naturalistic dialogue.\" Another characteristic of the British Invasion was a move away from the superhero genre, although in this regard Grant Morrison was an exception.\n\n\n"}

Born in Walton Hospital, he grew up in the village of Melling and attended nearby Deyes Lane Secondary Modern. He is the group's only constant member.\n\nAs a solo artist, Sergeant focused on minimalism and atmospherics, and usually released entirely instrumental music. Sergeant's first solo work was in 1978, when he self-produced \"Weird As Fish\" and made a total of seven copies. The album was officially released 25 years later. Early in the life of Echo & the Bunnymen, Sergeant recorded \"La Vie Luonge\", a soundtrack piece for a short Bunnymen concert film of the same name. His first formal solo album, \"Themes for Grind\", was released in 1982, while still active with Echo & the Bunnymen, and reached number 6 on the Indie album chart.\nSergeant continued with the Bunnymen even after Ian McCulloch left in 1988, bringing in Noel Burke to sing on \"Reverberation\" in 1990, before breaking up the band in 1993. In 1994, Sergeant and McCulloch reunited to form Electrafixion. The band toured extensively and released one album, \"Burned\", in 1995. After a few singles and more touring, the band began to play a large number of old Echo & the Bunnymen songs at their shows. In 1996, the Bunnymen reformed.\n\nSergeant also returned to solo work in 1997, under the moniker Glide, producing experimental, ambient and psychedelic instrumental music based around keyboard and electronic sounds. That year, he released the live \"Space Age Freak Out\", followed by another live album, \"Performance\", in 2000. Glide began to tour, and would often open for Echo & the Bunnymen in the early 2000s. Glide released \"Curvature of the Earth\" in 2004.\n\nSergeant has guested on Primal Scream's \"When the Bombs Drop\" (2006) and Baltic Fleet's self-titled debut album (2008).\n\nIn 2013 Will Sergeant and Les Pattinson, ex-bass player with Echo & the Bunnymen, formed \"Poltergeist\" with former Black Velvets drummer Nick Kilroe. They have been playing live and released an album called \"Your Mind Is A Box (Let Us Fill It With Wonder)\" in June 2013. Sergeant told journalist Jon Cronshaw that: “We don’t want to have to stick to the verse-chorus-verse format, because that’s what we have to do in the Bunnymen. We’re trying to do something that’s a bit different, and a bit more open-ended. We can do anything with this project because we’re not governed by any preconceptions about what people expect. If we wanted, we could do a 40-minute ambient nose flute solo if we really wanted, you know? I just like that aspect that we can take it anywhere.”\n\nThroughout his time with the Bunnymen in the '80s, Sergeant used a black Fender Telecaster with lots of reverb and delay. This gave the Bunnymen sound a clear, cutting tone. On several occasions during the '80s Sergeant would use a Fender Jaguar guitar. He used a Fender Stratocaster to a great extent on the 1987 \"Echo & the Bunnymen\" album. In the music video for \"Lips Like Sugar,\" he can be seen playing a vintage Hagström Deluxe 90, (possibly a prop since the performance is lip-synched to the studio track). When the Bunnymen reformed in 1997 he started using his Jaguar as his main instrument with a lot of tremolo. He also uses a Vox 12 string guitar.\n\n\"See: Echo & the Bunnymen discography\"\n\n\"See: Electrafixion#Discography\"\n\n\n\n"}

It ceased trading on 24 March 2010 after failing to secure new investment. The airline operated passenger and freight charters as well as scheduled services from its main base at Inverness Airport. Other services included newspaper distribution to the northern and Western Isles and, until recently, charter services for corporate clients. Highland Airways was under talks for a buyout by Perth-based, Air Charter Scotland. Aircraft were also based at Cardiff Airport.\n\nThe company held a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence. It was permitted to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats.\n\nThe airline was established and started operations in 1991. It was founded as Air Alba, operating for four years as a flying school. It was renamed Highland Airways in February 1997. When the newspaper industry relocated their charter departure point for Scottish islands to Inverness in 1998, Highland won the contract to provide two BAe Jetstream 31 aircraft per day for this task. One of these aircraft also carried business and leisure passengers on its \"Island hopper\" service as well as freight.\n\nHighland also expanded into contract work for the oil industry based in Aberdeen during 1998. Highland aircraft facilitated crew changes, business delegations, emergency freight or technician movements for the industry, meaning Highland Airways aircraft were regular visitors to the west coast of Ireland, the Faroe Islands and destinations in Norway including Stavanger and Bergen. The airline also began operating corporate charter services, most notably for BAE Systems, providing a daily service between Glasgow and the company's Filton Aerodrome, as well as flights for financial companies, electronics, utilities, whisky and the public sector. Highland have largely moved away from oil industry work, and after recent concerns about the financial stability of the company the BAE contract has been terminated and is now operated by Eastern Airways.\n\nGeneral aviation and ground handling facilities were provided by Highland at Stornoway and Benbecula, servicing both the airline itself and other operators.\n\nExperience with Jetstream and Cessna aircraft allowed the airline to occasionally carry out engineering work for third-party operators at its engineering facility in Inverness.\n\nHighland also won a 5-year contract to operate, crew and maintain two Cessna F406 reconnaissance aircraft on behalf of the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency. These aircraft were based in Inverness and wore SFPA markings.\n\nIn March 2007 Highland Airways underwent a management buyout from Atlantic Holdings led by A Mossman and had 100 employees (at January 2008). The buyout had been supported by an investment of £620,000 by the public Highlands and Islands Enterprise development agency.\n\nHighland Airways operated an intra-Wales flight connecting the north (Anglesey Airport) to the south (Cardiff Airport). Highland operated a BN2 Islander aircraft from Oban to Coll, Colonsay and Tiree under a contract with Argyll and Bute Council\n\nOn 24 March 2010, the airline was placed into voluntary administration, and all flights were cancelled, with no further bookings being taken. Highland Airways said that PricewaterhouseCoopers was taking over operation of the airline, and planned to transfer the services operated by Highland Airways to new operators. Following its bankruptcy, it has been revealed that the airline's debts run to more than £3.2m. Highland Airways' creditors were owed £1.13m, which includes a claim for more than £50,000 from Argyll and Bute Council.\n\nAt the time of its closure in March 2010, Highland Airways operated services to the following scheduled destinations:\n\n\nService between Benbecula and Stornoway was under contract from Comhairle nan Eilean Siar.\n\nThe Highland Airways fleet consisted of the following eleven aircraft at the time of its closure in March 2010:\n\n"}

It is licensed to New York City, and serves the New York metropolitan area. WXNY is owned by Uforia Audio Network and its transmitter is located at the Empire State Building in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nThe station first came on the air on 105.9 FM in 1964 as WHBI. The call letters stood for original owners Hoyt Brothers Incorporated. In the 1980s, the station - by then property of Multicultural Broadcasting - went by the call letters WNWK, and aired leased-access ethnic programming. (This time the call letters stood for NeWarK, its city of license.). In May 1998, Multicultural sold 105.9 FM to Heftel Broadcasting, a company at the time that owned Spanish language radio stations. Under the deal, Multicultural would be paid cash plus Heftel's second AM Radio station 930 WPAT which was running Radio Korea and other brokered programs. WPAT would drop Korea and pick up most of WNWK's brokered shows. Heftel's plans were to flip 105.9 to a Spanish Language mass appeal format of some sort.\n\nIn May 1998, 105.9 FM started playing hit Spanish music as \"Caliente 105.9\" (\"Hot 105.9\"), with the call letters WCAA. Heftel Broadcasting in a corporate deal became known as Hispanic Broadcasting.\n\nIn September 1999, the station changed its moniker to \"105.9 Latino Mix\" (\"105.9 Latin Mix\"). Eventually in another corporate deal Univision purchased Hispanic Broadcasting and entered into radio, making WCAA as well as WADO Univision owned. In February 2004, the station's owner, Univision Communications bought the 92.7 FM frequency in Garden City, New York which was the home of WLIR-FM and made it a western Long Island simulcast of 105.9 under the call letters WZAA. (While most New York City FM stations broadcast at 6,000 watts, 105.9 only has 600 watts of power, so 92.7 was used to give better coverage to Nassau County and Queens.)\n\nOn May 27, 2005, WCAA adapted a reggaeton format with the branding \"La Kalle\", which is a fanciful spelling of \"La Calle\", Spanish for \"the street.\"\n\nThe station's HD2 station, which it was launched in 2006, aired the original \"Caliente/Latino Mix\" format (The Tropical music format).\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Univision launched the national affiliates page for its \"La Kalle\" stations around the United States, the Mini-Page also includes Quick-Links to live audio streams of other La Kalle stations.\n\nAlso in mid-2006, the station adopted the slogan \"Yo Soy La Kalle!\" (\"I Am La Kalle!\"), thus replacing the \"Reggaeton y Mas\" slogan from its format change. The new slogan was also part of a nationwide promotional campaign that Univision adopted for most of its other La Kalle affiliates.\n\nIn late December 2006, the station dropped the \"Yo Soy La Kalle\" slogan for the slogan \"El Movimento Latino\" (in English, \"The Latino Movement\"). In February 2007, the La Activaeda Block and SUBELO Midday Mix switched DJs: DJ Kazzanova ran the 5 p.m. mix programming, and station resident DJ, DJ SpinOne, mixed the Midday Mix; however, some of the DJs were still in the station mixing in club broadcasts and mix shows, notably DJ Presice, who was still doing the Saturday \"The Show\" block and DJ Rey-Mo who was mixing on La Kalle during select live club mix broadcasts. In mid-April 2007, the regular La Activaeta Block returned with the same schedule before the Kazzanova-SpinOne switch.\n\nOn January 11, 2007, Univision dropped the La Kalle simulcast by flipping 92.7 WZAA to a regional Mexican format. The station is now known as 92.7 Qué Buena.\n\nIn an unprecedented decision by station executives in mid-February 2007, the station started playing more of their old format as opposed to just Reggaeton 24/7. Some of the schedule changes were to blame for this format mix-up. The station aired a mix of Bachata and Salsa, with Reggaeton still being a primary format. These changes had no effect on the mix shows, but DJ Kazzanova played some Bachata/Salsa sometimes during his mix shifts (not \"SUBELO Reggaeton Radio\", his syndicated Reggaeton show airing on this station). Also, in a TV advertisement spot, the new format mix was shown when one of the Bachata songs was shown in the ad.\n\nThese changes culminated on January 17, 2008 when Luis Jimenez returned to New York airwaves with his nationally syndicated morning show, The Luis Jimenez Show, until his cancellation on July 16, 2014, after 7 years because of low ratings. The format was similar to the \"Latino Mix\" format that dominated the station before 2005.\n\nOn July 14, 2009 it was announced that WCAA would move to the 96.3 frequency as a result of Univision radio buying the frequency. As a result, at 8 p.m. on October 8, 2009, classical WQXR-FM moved from 96.3 to 105.9, while WCAA moved to 96.3, dropped the La Kalle name and adopted a new name on October 15. It had been speculated the imaging for the station name would be X96.3 as Univision had registered the domain name X963FM.com as well as requested call letters WXNY from the FCC. In addition, the RDS text data on car radios was displaying \"96 X\". The station stunted with different genres of Spanish music and liners that pointed to the launch of the new branding, which took place on October 15 at 6 AM. At that time, the station relaunched as X 96.3 with call letters of WXNY-FM, as previously speculated.\nOn May 19, 2014, the station shifted towards a Hurban format. The station also updated its slogan to \"¡Música Urbana y Mucho Más!\"\n\nOn November 9, 2016, the station shifted to Spanish Rhythmic AC format with \"Super Hits: El Sonido de Hoy\" slogan.\n\nOn September 19, 2018, the station updated its to slogan to \"El Ritmo de New York\".\n\n\nAll shows (except \"Jersey Jumpoff\") were sold-out shows.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His buildings known as Robidoux Row are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This was a center for his family enterprise of fur trading, which he operated with his five brothers along the Mississippi and especially the Missouri River systems.\n\nRobidoux was the oldest of the six sons of Joseph Robidoux III (born in Sault-au-Recollet, Montreal,12 February 1750-, date of death unknown) and Catherine Rollet (born in Saint Louis, Missouri October 20, 1767, died in 1868). Joseph Robidoux IV was born in Saint Louis, Mo like six of his seven brothers who survived to adulthood. He was born August 5, 1783. Joseph Robidoux IV was the grandson of Joseph Robidoux (Born in Laprairie, Québec in 1722) and Marie-Anne Leblanc (date and place of birth unknown). He spent most of his childhood in St. Louis, Missouri, where his father introduced him and his brothers Francois, Pierre Isidore, Antoine, Louis, and Michael to the fur trade at an early age. (Weber, pp. 36) In 1799, at the age of 16, young Joseph began accompanying fur traders up the Missouri River.\n\nIn 1803, Robidoux's father sent him to organize a trading post at Fort Dearborn, the site of present-day Chicago. His early success there annoyed other traders, who engaged Indians to harass the young man and eventually drive him from the area. During this time he fell in love with the daughter of the village blacksmith, but he did not give his permission for the marriage because according to him some of the Robidoux's had surrendered their soul to the devil\n\nIn 1805, Joseph's wife of four years, Eugenie Delisle, died. She and Joseph had had two children, a daughter, Messanie, who preceded her mother in death, and a son, Joseph F. Robidoux, who use the given name of Joseph became a trader himself.\n\nIn 1809, the senior Robidoux established a trading post near the site of present-day North Omaha, Nebraska. He operated his trading post in the Council Bluffs area until 1822, when the American Fur Company bought him out and offered him $1,000 a year not to compete with them. A later post at the North Omaha site was operated by and named for Jean Pierre Cabanné. During the years of the War of 1812, the Robidoux brothers had to pull back their activities to the St. Louis area.\n\nIn 1813, the widower Robidoux married Angélique Vaudry, with whom he had six sons and one daughter (Faraon, Julius, Francis, Felix, Edmond, Charles, and Sylvanie).\n\nRobidoux returned to St. Louis, where he worked as a baker and confectioner. In 1826, he was hired by the American Fur Company to establish a trading post at the Blacksnake Hills (near the site of present-day Saint Joseph, Missouri.) He remained their employee for four years, at the salary of $1,800 a year, before becoming an independent trader. Built prior to 1830, Robidoux's home was located on the northwest corner of 2nd & Jules Streets in Saint Joseph. The first building in the settlement, the house was later removed to Krug Park as a historic attraction.\n\nRobidoux prospered in the years between 1830 and 1843, employing as many as 20 Frenchmen to engage in trade with the Native Americans to the west of his post. When Missouri entered the union in 1821, the state's western boundary was based on the Kaw River mouth in the Kansas City West Bottoms (approximately 94 degrees 36 minutes West longitude). The land where St. Joseph is now located belonged by treaty to the Ioway Tribe and the combined Sac Tribe and Fox Tribe. Robidoux was a licensed trader and legally allowed to be in the area as a trader.\n\nRobidoux was the most spectacular example of several enterprising white settlers who encroached on Indian land. Faced with the possibilities of more encroachment, the tribes in 1836 agreed to sell what is now the northwest corner of Missouri for $7,500 to the federal government in a deal at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. It was presided over by William Clark (of Lewis and Clark fame). The transaction, called the Platte Purchase, added an area almost the combined size of Rhode Island and Delaware to the State of Missouri.\n\nDuring this era, one of his slaves, Jeffrey Deroine, sued for his freedom, claiming abuse by Robidoux. Deroine lost the case, but his friends later purchased his freedom, and Deroine rose to prominence for his skills as a trader and linguist, becoming a well-known U.S. Government translator and diplomat.\n\nIn 1843, Robidoux hired two men, Frederick W. Smith and Simeon Kemper, to design a town for him. Under Kemper's plan the town was to have been called Robidoux, a feature Kemper thought would appeal to the trader. But, Robidoux preferred Smith's plan, as it featured more narrow streets, thus leaving more land for him to sell in the form of lots.\n\nPlans for the town were filed with the clerk of Common Pleas in St. Louis on July 26, 1843. Shortly thereafter, Robidoux began selling lots, with corner lots going for $150.00 and interior lots $100.00.\n\nSaint Joseph prospered quickly in the years after its founding, growing from a population of 800 in 1846 to 8,932 in 1860. Joseph Robidoux remained a prominent citizen. His early trading offices are known as Robidoux Row; the complex is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. He led in many development issues until his death, at the age of 85, in 1868. Present-day Saint Joseph retains the downtown streets which he named for his children and his second wife Angelique.\n\nRobidoux was an early fur trader. He later transitioned into operating a trading post along the route of western migrants, operating a major trading post in the area of Scott's Bluff from 1849–1851. Robidoux had an Indian wife, probably Shoshone, whose tribe would often visit his trading post. His daughter, Mary, married the Ioway chief Francis White Cloud and therefore Robidoux was grandfather to James White Cloud and Jefferson White Cloud, would also be named Ioway chiefs.\n\nJoseph was married three times. His first wife was Eugenie DeLisle (1704–1805). Joseph and Eugenie had two children:\nJoseph’s second wife was unknown, but was said to be Native American. The couple had one child:\nJoseph’s third wife was Angélique Vaudry, great-granddaughter of Jean-Baptiste Chevalier, one of the early founders of Fort Michilimackinac. Joseph and Angélique had six children that lived to adulthood:\n\nJoseph had two illegitimate children with Angeline Caroline Jones. Joseph Henry Robidoux Papst born in St. Joseph, MI in 1853 and Madora Rubidoux Papst born in 1855. \n\nJoseph died on 27 May 1868, and was buried at the Calvary Cemetery in St. Joseph.

It replaced the mil, which was the 1000th part of the Palestine pound, a currency issued by the British Mandate of Palestine prior to May 1948.\n\nThe word \"pruta\" was borrowed from Mishnaic Hebrew, in which it meant \"a coin of smaller value\". This word was probably derived originally from an Aramaic word with the same meaning. The pruta was abolished in 1960, when the Israeli government decided to change the subdivision of the Israeli pound into 100 agorot. This move was necessary due to the constant devaluation of the Israeli pound, which rendered coins smaller than 10 prutot redundant.\n\nThis pruta should not be confused with the halachic pruta, which is the minimal value of money for a variety of halachic applications—among them, the minimal value one is obligated to return if stolen, the minimal value needed to effect a marriage, and the minimal investment needed to be considered an investor (it is equivalent to 0.025 grams of pure silver).\n\n"}
{"id": "2005953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2005953", "title": "Goemon Ishikawa XIII", "text": "Goemon Ishikawa XIII\n\nGoemon is unique to the series as he was the only character not there from the beginning. Monkey Punch, in an interview featured on the American \"\" DVD release, mentioned he added Goemon later as he felt the manga needed a more Japanese character. As such, Goemon was primarily based on the character Kyūzō, the master swordsman of Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film \"Seven Samurai\". From the role came Goemon's strict demeanor and fast draw blade, as well as the long-faced countenance of actor Seiji Miyaguchi.\n\nIn the original manga, Goemon first appears as a very dangerous enemy of Lupin in chapter 28 . Lupin attempts to steal Goemon's master's alchemic formula for impervious sword blades through infiltration of Goemon's clan, but his cover is blown by Fujiko Mine, who is Goemon's girlfriend at the time. Goemon tries to kill Lupin over the next several installments, making attempts ranging from hiring assassins as skilled as Daisuke Jigen himself, to entering the service of three martial arts masters, to planting bombs in Lupin's belongings. However, he later decides that he could learn more working for Lupin than against him, and rather abruptly switches his allegiance. His position at Lupin's side is cemented when Lupin ruins the government's case against the man who killed Goemon's uncle, allowing Goemon to take his revenge as brutally and publicly as he wants without having to break into prison to do so.\n\nBy the events of the second manga series, Lupin trusts Goemon implicitly, and Goemon reciprocates. When a rival of Lupin's captures and hideously tortures Goemon, Goemon refuses to even respond to his interrogation, except to say that Lupin would find him and allow him to take revenge. Lupin then captures and seduces his rival's wife, and uses the information gleaned to rescue Goemon, who slays his captor with Jigen's help.\n\nIn the original anime Goemon's relationship to Lupin starts off more professional than close friendship. By the second anime series, Goemon has developed a true loyalty to Lupin. However, he easily gets annoyed by Lupin's antics, especially Lupin's infatuation with women and Fujiko Mine in particular. He will occasionally oppose Lupin directly when Lupin's jobs or actions do not agree with his morals. He has even promised that the last act he will take with Lupin is delivering his deathblow. However, Goemon doesn't hesitate to help Lupin in serious situations, and readily assists him any time Lupin works for a just cause. However, in 1978's \"The Mystery of Mamo\", he claims that he helps Lupin simply so he can keep his vow to kill him himself.\n\nGoemon has a much more amicable relationship with Jigen. Goemon sees Jigen as a fellow honorable warrior, while Jigen sees Goemon as a trustworthy \"foxhole buddy\", and the two are frequently paired together during jobs, and usually help keep Lupin in check. On the odd occasion and increasingly in recent years, Goemon will ally himself with Fujiko, in spite of his distrust of her.\n\nA master of a number of classic Japanese martial arts, Goemon excels at Kenjutsu and Battōjutsu. Using his trademark Zantetsuken sword, he has the ability to cut through virtually any substance, even steel girders, automobiles, and multi-storied buildings. His training includes Jujutsu, Aikido and Karate, enabling barehanded vanquishing of several attackers at once with minimal effort. In spite of his invincible sword and his martial arts expertise, Goemon prefers to incapacitate rather than kill opponents. Since katanas traditionally must cut flesh before being returned to the scabbard, Goemon reacts to his non-lethal use of Zantetsuken by exclaiming \"Mata tsumaranu mono o kitte shimatta\" (\"Once again, I have cut an unworthy [worthless] object\").\n\nGoemon has an extreme sense of pride in his abilities, and when he cannot accomplish a task, feels shame and remorse afterward. Breaking Zantetsuken, as he did in a battle with Flinch in \"The Mystery of Mamo\", is a common cause of shame. He will also show chagrin when he succumbs to his weaknesses, as when a woman ran off with his sword in \"Memories of the Flame: Tokyo Crisis\". On many of these occasions, Goemon will leave to meditate or further train to rid himself of his weak points.Goemon shows allegiance to Japanese culture as strictly as his traveling and unique lifestyle can allow. He dresses in a hakama and fundoshi, and prefers wearing his hair long and somewhat unevenly cut. He only eats Japanese cuisine, willing to fast rather than settle for any Western options. He is a firm believer in Buddhism and Shinto. Although he may toast with champagne, his drink of choice is sake. He occasionally has been seen smoking a kiseru and usually wears a Sugegasa style hat.\n\nWhile Goemon is traditionally fearless in battle, he shows a boyish shyness when confronted by attractive women. His reaction to viewing a woman in scanty clothing is adverting his gaze and blushing; this embarrassment typically is performed even when in the company of women he has romantic interest for, such as Murasaki Suminawa, his fiance in \"The Plot of the Ninja Clan\".\n\nGoemon's most often seen pastime is meditation. Even under threat or when locked up, he is typically seated on the floor in a state of mental seclusion so deep he cannot be budged from his position. Other activities Goemon favors include fishing, attending noh theater, and participating in martial arts competitions.\n\nAlthough typically a person of mellow aloofness, Goemon has been seen exploding with frustration, as well as admiring beautiful women and (very rarely) screaming in fright. Such out of character moments are usually treated as humorous takes. If Goemon has a true weakness, it is that he's a sucker for women, even more than Lupin. He readily trusts any woman who seems superficially trustworthy or innocent, often landing him in much trouble. At the same time, he fears sultry women will distract him from his training, and tends to blush or flee when any woman puts him in a less than modest situation.\n\nGoemon also is very bad with money as well as falling for any scam that states will show the path of enlightenment, and constantly charges Lupin for his services in some fashion. In \"$1 Money Wars\" he gives it to the female leader of a cult, who promptly runs off with it.\n\nCommonly thought to be just a samurai, an episode of the second TV series (\"Goemon's Revenge\") has Goemon visiting his Iga ninja sensei. This episode depicts him as having had the training of a master ninja, perhaps giving some reason behind his willingness to find thievery as an acceptable practice, in spite of his samurai ways.\n\nGoemon Ishikawa was first voiced by Gorō Naya in the CinemaScope version of the 1969 pilot film for the first anime, while Osamu Kobayashi voiced him in the pilot's TV version. However, Chikao Ōtsuka was given the role when the first anime was actually produced (1971–72). Goemon was taken over by Makio Inoue for the second anime (1977–78), who continued to voice the character until 2010, with one exception. Due to budget concerns, TMS decided not to employ the regular voice cast for the 1987 original video animation \"The Fuma Conspiracy\", with Goemon voiced by Kaneto Shiozawa. The 2011 TV special \"Blood Seal - Eternal Mermaid\" marked the first appearance of Daisuke Namikawa as the character and he continues to voice Goemon Ishikawa to this day. Inoue did return to the role once more for the 2012 \"Lupin Family Lineup\" short original video animation.\n\nWilliam Ross voiced Goemon in the 1979 Toho English dub of \"The Mystery of Mamo\", where his name was changed to \"Samurai\". Ross founded Frontier Enterprises, the studio that produced this dub under his direction. Other voice actors include Steve Kramer (1992-3, Streamline), Mark Franklin (1995, AnimEigo). Ardwight Chamberlain (1995, Streamline), Garrick Hagon (1996, Manga UK), and Michael Gregory (2000, Animaze/Manga). Mike McFarland voiced the character for Funimation Entertainment's dubs of several TV specials and theatrical films between 2002 and 2005, and their 2013 dub of \"The Woman Called Fujiko Mine\". Lex Lang voiced Goemon in the Phuuz dub for Pioneer/Geneon's release of the second anime between 2003 and 2006, and reprised the role for Discotek Media's dubs of the fifth and sixth anime as well as \"Goemon Ishikawa's Spray of Blood\".\n\nThe 2012 film \"Lupin the Third\" featured TV and film star Gō Ayano as the first live-action Goemon. Originally it was arranged to present the filmed Goemon in contemporary suit and tie with Director Ryûhei Kitamura expressing \"it would be nonsense for Goemon to exist in current society wearing samurai garb and carrying around a katana.\" Apparently due to the demand of fans world over, this idea was scrapped and the completed film features Gō Ayano as a swordsman wearing robes similar to his drawn and animated counterparts.\n\nIn 2007, \"Oricon\" magazine polled readers on which characters they would most like to see in their own series. Goemon appeared in the number eight position on the female readers polls, and seventh place in the combined poll.\n\n"}

Some, such as piracetam, are considered nootropics. Some such as aniracetam, oxiracetam, pramiracetam and phenylpiracetam are also nootropics. Others such as levetiracetam and seletracetam are anticonvulsants.\n\nThere is no universally accepted mechanism of action for racetams. Racetams generally show negligible affinity for common central nervous system receptors, but modulation of central neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine and glutamate, has been reported. Although aniracetam and nebracetam show affinity for muscarinic receptors, only nefiracetam demonstrates nanomolar interactions. Modification of membrane-located mechanisms of central signal transduction is another hypothesis.\n\nLike some ampakines, some racetams such as piracetam and aniracetam are positive allosteric modulators of the AMPA receptor.\n\nRacetams are understood to work by activating glutamate receptors that are colocalized with cholinergic receptors, thus increasing the frequency of activation of the latter. Racetams are posited to enhance memory through interaction with cholinergic and glutamate receptors in the central nervous system.\n\nMethylphenylpiracetam is a positive allosteric modulator of the sigma-1 receptor.\n\nIn studies with aged rats, marked improvement has been observed in cognitive tasks in experimental groups given piracetam. Performance was further increased with piracetam combined with cholines. Evidence in studies with rats has indicated that the potency of piracetam is increased when administered with choline.\n\nAll racetams are schedule 4 substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2020). A schedule 4 substance is classified as \"Prescription Only Medicine, or Prescription Animal Remedy – Substances, the use or supply of which should be by or on the order of persons permitted by State or Territory legislation to prescribe and should be available from a pharmacist on prescription.\" \n"}
{"id": "2005971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2005971", "title": "George Washington Bush", "text": "George Washington Bush\n\nGeorge Bush (1779 – April 5, 1863) was an American pioneer and one of the first african-american (Irish and African) non-Amerindian settlers of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nGeorge Bush was born in Pennsylvania around 1779. An only child, he was raised as a Quaker and educated in Philadelphia. Bush's African American father, Matthew Bush, was born in India. Matthew Bush worked for a wealthy English merchant named Stevenson for most of his life. At Stevenson's home in Philadelphia, Matthew Bush met his wife, an Irish maid who also worked for Stevenson, and they married in 1778. Pennsylvania did not repeal its anti-miscegenation law until 1780, suggesting that Matthew Bush was either not considered black, or he was married under the care of Germantown Friends Meeting in violation of the law. George's parents served Stevenson until his death. Stevenson had no other family and so left the Bushes a substantial fortune.\n\nWhen he was about twenty years old, Bush moved to Illinois where he entered the cattle business for the first time. In about 1820 Bush moved his cattle business to Missouri where he remained for the next twenty years.\n\nBush fought under Andrew Jackson in the War of 1812 at the Battle of New Orleans. Bush, Jeremiah Mabie and William Rutledge are the only known War of 1812 veterans to have settled in Thurston County, and the earliest known U.S. veterans in the county. He later worked as a voyageur and fur trapper with a Frenchman named Joseph Robidoux IV headquartered in St. Louis, then spent several years in the Oregon Country working for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC).\n\nAbout the time Robidoux was hired to establish a trading post at the Blacksnake Hills (which became St. Joseph, Missouri), Bush moved to the area near said trading post and in 1828 purchased (with cash not grant or homestead) 80 acres of land. His property was in an unorganized part of Clay County, where he married Isabella James, the daughter of a Baptist minister of German descent, on July 4, 1830. Missouri was a slave state at the time and had adopted anti-miscegenation laws in 1821, but like his father's marriage, there is no evidence that his marriage was thought to be illegal at the time. Bush was a free man and had never been a slave, but, while he was of African and Irish descent, Missouri did not provide him the same legal status as a white man. It is noted that the marriage was performed by John P. Smith, Justice of the Peace, who may have had an arrangement with Bush. Smith had been appointed Justice less than a month before Bush's marriage, immediately following the formation of Washington Township in May 1830. To qualify for the formation of the township they had to certify to the Secretary of State \"that there were at least 95 taxable inhabitants in the township upon its creation,\" including George Bush, whose 1828 land purchase was within Washington Twp boundaries.\n\nSome sources state that his family lived in comfort there, while others suggest they faced increasing prejudice. Land records show they moved from the edge of Clay County to unorganized territory in what became Daviess County, and finally into unclaimed territory north of St. Joseph. This area was annexed after the Platte Purchase, and organized into Andrew County in 1841. The Bush family left a few years later.\n\nThe family had nine boys, of which six survived past infancy, including Owen in 1832, Joseph T in 1833, Riley B in 1836, Henry S in 1840, January J in 1844, all in Missouri, and Lewis Nisqually in 1847 in the new territory.\n\nIn 1844, Bush and his family (along with five other families including his friend Michael Simmons) left Missouri, heading west on the Oregon Trail. Bush's navigation skills and knowledge of the western region, gained during his years as a trapper, made him the indispensable guide of the party. Isabella's training as a nurse was an important contribution as well. Bush and his family were also known to be very generous, purchasing supplies for their fellow travelers first in Missouri and later at great expense at Fort Bridger. Bush bought six Conestoga wagons, equipping them with enough provisions for a year, and helped several families make the trip to Oregon. According to the Bush family history, Bush built a false bottom onto his wagon in which he hid over a hundred pounds of silver, worth about $2,000. The great-granddaughter of Bush claims that Bush had hidden $5,000 in silver dollars, some gold bricks, and fifty dollar slugs. With him he brought many species of fruit and shade trees that he would plant in his farm at Bush Prairie.\n\nBy the time the Bush-Simmons party reached the Oregon Country over four months later, the Provisional Government of Oregon reacting to racially-charged violence had passed an exclusionary law barring black persons, slave or free, from entering the Oregon Territory on pain of lashing. As a result, Bush and his party traveled north across the Columbia River, into territory that at the time was claimed by both the United States and Great Britain. Bush's connections with the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Vancouver may have helped the settlers gain access where the company had previously barred Americans from settling.\n\nThe Bushes and the other five families established a settlement, named Bush Prairie, at the southernmost tip of Puget Sound in what is now Tumwater, Washington (). (Tumwater's official history has been \"white washed\" giving almost all the credit for its founding to Simmons and the other white settlers; and mentions only in passing one of the main founding fathers of Tumwater, George Bush) Bush and Michael Simmons built the area's first gristmill and sawmill in 1845, and Bush helped finance Simmons' logging company. Bush introduced the first mower and reaper to the area in 1856.\n\nIn addition to their farm, the Bushes ran a roadside hotel for free. Wayfarers traveling between Cowlitz Landing and Puget Sound liked to stop there. It was open to anyone who came through the area. The Bushes would give visitors a good square meal and gave gifts of grain and fruit grown on the Bush farm.\n\nThe Oregon Treaty of 1846 ended the joint administration north of the Columbia, placing Bush Prairie firmly in the United States. By staking an American claim to the area, Bush and his party had also brought Oregon's black American exclusion laws, clouding the title to their land; these laws would not have applied if the territory were under the British Empire. When the Washington Territory was formed in 1853, one of the first actions of the Territorial Legislature in Olympia was to ask Congress to give the Bushes unambiguous ownership of their land, which it did in 1855. Bush was thus among the very first African-American landowners in Washington State.\n\nAccording to the Oregon Trail History Library,\n\nThe Bush-Simmons Party is credited by some historians as having been in large part responsible for bringing the land north of the Columbia River—the present-day state of Washington—into the United States. They established a presence that attracted other settlers and strengthened the American claim to the area in later debates between Great Britain and the United States over partitioning the Oregon Country.\n\nGeorge Bush lived out the rest of his life in Washington. He maintained excellent relations with local Amerindians, many of whom he nursed through epidemics of measles and smallpox. He also extended remarkable generosity towards his fellow settlers, sharing grain with needy neighbors rather than selling it to speculators at great personal profit. One year, wheat was in short supply and Bush was offered an unheard-of price for his entire crop. His response was\n\n\"I'll just keep my grain to let my neighbors who have had failures have enough to live on and for seeding their fields in the spring. They have no money to pay your fancy prices and I don't intend to see them want for anything in my power to provide them with.\"\n\nBush died in Tumwater on April 5, 1863. Isabella James Bush died September 12, 1866.\n\nHistorians have noted how Bush's experience exemplifies the interdependence and interconnection of people from different racial groups on the western frontier, as well as the ugliness of racial prejudice.\n\nTheir six sons carried on their tradition of farming and public service. The eldest, William Owen Bush, served twice in the Washington State Legislature. In 1890, he introduced the bill establishing the institution that is now Washington State University.\n\nIn 1973, Jacob Lawrence did a series of five paintings depicting George Bush's journey by wagon train from Missouri to Bush Prairie. The paintings are in the collection of the Washington State Historical Society.\n\nIn 2009, a Bush butternut tree was planted in Bush's memory on the grounds of the Washington State Capitol campus, and later also dedicated in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. The tree is a direct descendant of a seedling brought west on Bush's wagon and planted in 1845 at the Bush homestead on Bush Prairie. That tree is one of the largest, and likely the oldest living butternut tree in the United States.\n\nBush was buried in Tumwater, Washington at Union Cemetery, now a city pioneer cemetery called Bush/Union/Pioneer Calvary Cemetery. The cemetery is listed on the national, state and city registers of historic places.\n\n\nHistory Takes Root: Tree Sapling From Pioneer George Bush ...\n[Search domain www.chronline.com/news/history-takes-root-tree-sapling-from-pioneer-george-bush-planted/article_7bd06286-cc1f-11e7-a446-6f1be6c25ca3.ht ml]\n\nResearch paper - \"Nobody Actually Knows What George Bush Looked Like\"\n\n\n"}

It is a short text which sketches in some 90 paragraphs a metaphysics of simple substances, or \"monads\".\n\nDuring his last stay in Vienna from 1712 to September 1714, Leibniz wrote two short texts in French which were meant as concise expositions of his philosophy. After his death \"Principes de la nature et de la grâce fondés en raison\", which was intended for prince Eugene of Savoy, appeared in French in the Netherlands. Christian Wolff and collaborators published translations in German and Latin of the second text which came to be known as \"The Monadology\". Without having seen the Dutch publication of the \"Principes\" they had assumed that it was the French original of the \"Monadology,\" which in fact remained unpublished until 1840.\n\nThe German translation appeared in 1720 as \"Lehrsätze über die Monadologie\" and the following year the \"Acta Eruditorum\" printed the Latin version as \"Principia philosophiae\". There are three original manuscripts of the text: the first written by Leibniz and overcharged with corrections and two further emended copies with some corrections appearing in one but not the other. Leibniz himself inserted references to the paragraphs of his \"Théodicée\" (\"Theodicy\", i.e. a justification of God), sending the interested reader there for more details.\n\nThe \"monad\", the word and the idea, belongs to the Western philosophical tradition and has been used by various authors. Leibniz, who was exceptionally well read, could not have ignored this, but he did not use it himself until mid-1696 when he was sending for print his \"New System\". Apparently he found with it a convenient way to expose his own philosophy as it was elaborated in this period. What he proposed can be seen as a modification of occasionalism developed by latter-day Cartesians. Leibniz surmised that there are indefinitely many substances individually 'programmed' to act in a predetermined way, each substance being coordinated with all the others. This is the pre-established harmony which solved the mind-body problem, but at the cost of declaring any interaction between substances a mere appearance.\n\nThe rhetorical strategy adopted by Leibniz in \"The Monadology\" is fairly obvious as the text\n\n(I) As far as Leibniz allows just one type of element in the building of the universe his system is monistic. The unique element has been 'given the general name monad or entelechy' and described as 'a simple substance' (§§1, 19). When Leibniz says that monads are 'simple,' he means that \"which is one, has no parts and is therefore indivisible\". Relying on the Greek etymology of the word \"entelechie\"\n(§18), Leibniz posits quantitative differences in perfection between monads which leads to a hierarchical ordering. The basic order is three-tiered: (1) entelechies or created monads (§48), (2) souls or entelechies with perception and memory (§19), and (3) spirits or rational souls (§82). Whatever is said about the lower ones (entelechies) is valid for the higher (souls and spirits) but not vice versa. As none of them is without a body (§72), there is a corresponding hierarchy of (1) living beings and animals (2), the latter being either (2) non-reasonable or (3) reasonable. The degree of perfection in each case corresponds to cognitive abilities and only spirits or reasonable animals are able to grasp the ideas of both the world and its creator. Some monads have power over others because they can perceive with greater clarity, but primarily, one monad is said to dominate another if it contains the reasons for the actions of other(s). Leibniz believed that any body, such as the body of an animal or man, has one dominant monad which controls the others within it. This dominant monad is often referred to as the soul.\n\n(II) God is also said to be a simple substance (§47) but it is the only one necessary (§§38–9) and without a body attached (§72). Monads perceive others \"with varying degrees of clarity, except for God, who perceives all monads with utter clarity\". God could take any and all perspectives, knowing of both potentiality and actuality. As well as that God in all his power would know the universe from each of the infinite perspectives at the same time, and so his perspectives—his thoughts—\"simply are monads\". Creation is a permanent state, thus \"[monads] are generated, so to speak, by continual fulgurations of the Divinity\" (§47). Any perfection comes from being created while imperfection is a limitation of nature (§42). The monads are unaffected by each other, but each have a unique way of expressing themselves in the universe, in accordance with God's infinite will.\n\n(III) Composite substances or matter are \"actually sub-divided without end\" and have the properties of their infinitesimal parts (§65). A notorious passage (§67) explains that \"each portion of matter can be conceived as like a garden full of plants, or like a pond full of fish. But each branch of a plant, each organ of an animal, each drop of its bodily fluids is also a similar garden or a\nsimilar pond\". There are no interactions between different monads nor between entelechies and their bodies but everything is regulated by the pre-established harmony (§§78–9). Much like how one clock may be in synchronicity with another, but the first clock is not caused by the second (or vice versa), rather they are only keeping the same time because the last person to wind them set them to the same time. So it is with monads; they may seem to cause each other, but rather they are, in a sense, \"wound\" by God's pre-established harmony, and thus appear to be in synchronicity. Leibniz concludes that \"if we could understand the order of the universe well enough, we would find that it surpasses all the wishes of the wisest people, and that it is impossible to make it better than it is—not merely in respect of the whole in general, but also in respect of ourselves in particular\" (§90).\n\nIn his day, atoms were proposed to be the smallest division of matter. Within Leibniz's theory, however, substances are not technically real, so monads are not the smallest part of matter, rather they are the only things which are, in fact, real. To Leibniz, space and time were an illusion, and likewise substance itself. The only things that could be called real were utterly simple beings of psychic activity \"endowed with perception and appetite.\" The other objects, which we call matter, are merely phenomena of these simple perceivers. \"Leibniz says, 'I don't really eliminate body, but reduce [revoco] it to what it is. For I show that corporeal mass [massa], which is thought to have something over and above simple substances, is not a substance, but a phenomenon resulting from simple substances, which alone have unity and absolute reality.' (G II 275/AG 181)\" Leibniz's philosophy is sometimes called \"'panpsychic idealism' because these substances are psychic rather than material\". That is to say, they are mind-like substances, not possessing spatial reality. \"In other words, in the Leibnizian monadology, simple substances are mind-like entities that do not, strictly speaking, exist in space but that represent the universe from a unique perspective.\" It is the harmony between the perceptions of the monads which creates what we call substances, but that does not mean the substances are real in and of themselves.\n\n(IV) Leibniz uses his theory of Monads to support his argument that we live in the best of all possible worlds. He uses his basis of perception but not interaction among monads to explain that all monads must draw their essence from one ultimate monad. He then claims that this ultimate monad would be God because a monad is a “simple substance” and God is simplest of all substances, He cannot be broken down any further. This means that all monads perceive “with varying degrees of perception, except for God, who perceives all monads with utter clarity” . This superior perception of God then would apply much the in same way that he says a dominant monad controls our soul, all other monads associated with it would, essentially, shade themselves towards Him. With all monads being created by the ultimate monad and shading themselves in the image of this ultimate monad, Leibniz argues that it would be impossible to conceive of a more perfect world because all things in the world are created by and imitating the best possible monad .\n\nThe \"Monadology\" tried to answer two huge philosophical questions—both studied by Descartes—from a monist point of view. The first is about the nature of reality. The second, about the problem of communication of substances, is related to a common objection to mind-body dualism, namely, the body-soul interaction problem. Thus, Leibniz offered a new solution to the mind-matter interaction problem by positing a pre-established harmony between substances: the body is mere perceptions, which are all contained in a soul's complete concept. The soul and body interact and agree in virtue of the pre-established harmony, maintained by God. Leibniz also drew the relationship between \"the kingdom of final causes\", or teleological ones, and \"the kingdom of efficient causes\", or mechanical ones, which was not causal, but synchronous. So, monads and matter are only apparently linked, and there is not even any communication between different monads; there is only harmony, pre-established and maintained by God.\n\nLeibniz fought against the Cartesian dualist system in his \"Monadology\" and instead opted for a monist idealism (since substances are all unextended). However, Leibniz was a pluralist in the sense that substances are disseminated in the world in an infinite number. For that reason the monad is an irreducible force, which makes it possible for the bodies to have the characteristics of inertia and impenetrability, and which contains in itself the source of all its actions. Monads are the first elements of every composed thing.\n\nLeibniz creates an argument that flows smoothly and logically from point to point. If only inspected for validity, an adversary would be hard-pressed to find any errors. He starts his argument out with the groundwork and definitions before using those definitions to build his argument from the ground up, it being a rather unorthodox philosophical explanation. He builds this idea of monads, connecting ideas with logical reasoning and explanation where needed. \n\nHowever, an adversary could be sound in challenging the truth behind some of his claims. Specifically, Leibniz writes a potential false premise in his definition of how monads interact. He states that monads are “endowed with perception and appetite” but cannot interact. This is not necessarily false, but is a claim that he does not backup with sufficient evidence in his Monadology. Typically, this would be enough to essentially throw out the entirety of his argument because it is all built upon this assumption, but in this specific case, it happens to be less problematic, only because the claim is not provable. Monads are a theoretical “simple substance”, so there is no specific physical substance that can ever be known as a monad, since there could always be an unknown simpler substance inside. This means that interactions among monads, or lack thereof, can never be proven or disproven since it can never be proven that it is, in fact, monads that are being examined. That is why Leibniz’s argument for monads must be taken with a grain of salt, but still can be taken in the first place.\n\nMonads are too complex to be the simplest substance in the universe. For example, the quality of perception takes pages to explain. Yet, Leibniz predicts this argument and writes, “monads must have some qualities, otherwise they would not even be existing things” . And, while that may be true, the simplest substance only needs to contain one quality, “existence”, to fulfill the role. Take, for instance, Occam’s Razor which states that the simplest answer is usually the correct one . Compare it to Monadology. Either the simplest substance is something which contains multiple attributes, or it is something which contains only one attribute (ie. Existence). Following this logic, it is plain to see that the latter is more likely to be the simplest substance. As monads are the former, they cannot be the simplest substance.\n\nThe problem is that when there are qualities, there must be something to bind the qualities together. Locke calls this binding matter \"substantia\" meaning the support that attaches qualities to the object. Monads, containing a handful of attributes, require metaphorical adhesive or \"substantia,\" to stick the attributes to the monad. But, with the addition of such adhesive, they are rendered merely a substance and not the simplest substance. A truly simple substance does not need \"substantia\" as it merely exists. Existence is its entire being and its only quality. Essentially, this critique rests on the idea of \"Quantitative Ontological Parsimony,\" meaning that because the theory that there exists something simpler than monads is more basic in nature and postulates fewer entities, it ought to be preferred . So, in so far as Leibniz places additional characteristics and attributes on monads, the search for the simplest substance continues.\n\nThis theory leads to:\n\n1. Idealism, since it denies things in themselves (besides monads) and multiplies them in different points of view. Monads are \"perpetual living mirrors of the universe.\"\n\n2. Metaphysical optimism, through the principle of sufficient reason, developed as follows:\n\na) Everything exists according to a reason (by the axiom \"Nothing arises from nothing\");\n\nb) Everything which exists has a sufficient reason to exist;\n\nc) Everything which exists is better than anything nonexistent (by the first point: since it is more rational, it also has more reality), and, consequently, it is the best possible being in the best of all possible worlds (by the axiom: \"That which contains more reality is better than that which contains less reality\").\n\n\n\n"}

The lead character, Colonel Steve Austin, became an iconic 1970s television science fiction action hero, portrayed by American actor Lee Majors, in American television series \"The Six Million Dollar Man\", which aired on the ABC network as a regular series for five seasons from 1974 to 1978. In the television series, Steve Austin takes on special high-risk government missions using his superhuman bionic powers. The television character Steve Austin became a pop culture icon of the 1970s.\n\"The Six Million Dollar Man\" television series had as its original working title during pre-production the Martin Caidin novel \"Cyborg\" title.\n\nCaidin's version of Steve Austin appeared in only four original novels unrelated to the television series continuity: \"Cyborg\", \"Operation Nuke\", \"High Crystal\", and \"Cyborg IV\".\n\nFollowing \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" television series, Lee Majors reprised the role of Colonel Steve Austin in several bionic-themed reunion television movies in the late 1980s and 1990s.\n\nAs originally conceived by Caidin, Austin is a former US Army helicopter pilot who served in Vietnam before transferring to the Air Force and then into NASA. As backup Lunar Module Pilot for Apollo 17, he became one of twelve astronauts to walk on the moon when the primary lunar module pilot broke an arm before launch.\n\nIn the pilot episode of \"The Six Million Dollar Man\", Austin's background is adjusted: he is a civilian test pilot who was the only civilian to walk on the moon. In the regular series, however, Austin once again became a military man, holding the rank of colonel in the Air Force. In the episode \"Pilot Error\" Austin is shown to be wearing both the Vietnam Service Medal and the Vietnam Campaign Medal on his dress uniform, implying that he is a Vietnam veteran.\n\nIn both versions of his origin, Austin is testing an experimental lifting body aircraft when a malfunction causes a crash. Austin's injuries are severe: both legs and one arm are lost, and he is also blinded in one eye and his skull is fractured (the TV version does not suffer the skull injury). One of Austin's best friends is Dr. Rudy Wells, a doctor and scientist who is a specialist in the newly emerging field of bionics; unknown to Wells, a secret American government intelligence agency, the Office of Strategic Operations (OSO; later changed to Office of Scientific Intelligence or OSI for TV) has been looking at a way of reducing agent casualties. Their solution is to take a severely injured man, rebuild him with bionics, and create a cyborg—part man, part machine. Wells is ordered to perform the procedure on Austin, who expresses a desire to commit suicide after learning about the loss of his limbs.\n\nThe operation to rebuild him costs $6 million ($36 million in 2018 dollars). Bionics are used to replace Austin's arm (his left in Caidin's original story; his right in the TV version) and both legs. Austin's eye is also replaced. Caidin and the TV series treat this differently; Caidin's Austin receives a sophisticated miniature camera (activated by pressing a hidden shutter implanted under Austin's skin after which the eye has to be removed before development of the film) but otherwise remains blinded in that eye, while the television version not only restores sight but also has extreme telescopic magnification and infrared capabilities. His legs and arm provide Austin with superhuman speed, strength, and endurance (the latter because, Caidin writes, Austin's heart and lungs only need to power his torso, head and remaining arm). Caidin's character also had some additional bionic parts his TV counterpart lacked, such as a steel-reinforced skull, a poison dart gun built into one of his bionic fingers, and a radio transmitter built into a rib.\n\nAnother big distinction between Caidin's original and his television counterpart is the extent to which the bionics could supply strength and speed. In the former, Austin's strength and speed were limited by the physical abilities of the connecting human parts. For instance, Austin could run faster than the best Olympic athlete, whereas the TV character could run 60 MPH. Caidin himself satirized the TV series' unrealistic science in another novel, \"ManFac.\"\n\nBoth versions of the character are subsequently recruited into the OSO/OSI as a secret agent (and as an ongoing test subject for bionics). Austin becomes a top agent, traveling the world to fight everything from terrorism (the most common target of the literary version of the character) to even alien invasion on television. As a military officer he remains an active member of the NASA Astronaut Corps, but the media describes his command of the Athena Rescue mission (necessary because his bionic strength is needed) as a surprise. Austin is obscure enough to usually maintain his anonymity, and uses his astronaut status to establish credibility when necessary.\n\nAustin's personality was altered in the TV series. In the books, Austin was capable of being cold-blooded and did not hesitate to use his powers to kill if necessary. Yet in the TV pilot, Austin is initially hesitant to work for the OSI because, he says, \"I don't want to kill people,\" although he appears to do just that in the subsequent mission. After the show's first season, however, Austin was usually not shown killing anyone.\n\nIn Caidin's novels, Austin's superior is OSO chief Oscar Goldman. Goldman was replaced by another character, Oliver Spencer, in the TV pilot film, but appeared in the regular series. The relationship between the TV version of Austin and Oscar was much friendlier than the literary counterpart, although numerous episodes show Austin being frustrated at being a \"bionic lap dog\" for the OSI.\n\nAustin's backstory is barely described by Caidin. The TV series, however, introduced his mother and stepfather (who live in Ojai, California), and eventually, a fiancée, Jaime Sommers, who later became bionic after a skydiving accident, leading to a spin-off series, \"The Bionic Woman\". Lee Majors made frequent guest appearances on the spin-off series, which springboarded from Jaime being brought back to life after her bionics failed; a consequence of this was she lost all memory of her relationship to Austin. Both \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" and \"The Bionic Woman\" went off the air in 1978.\n\nA later episode reveals that Austin's biological father was also an Air Force pilot and was killed in the crash of his C-47 Skytrain in the China-Burma-India Theater during World War II.\n\nFurther details about Austin's later life were filled in during . In the first (\"The Return of the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman\"), which takes place several years after Austin retires from the OSI, it is revealed that he had a son, Michael, born in the mid-1960s. His mother is not identified. Michael subsequently suffers traumatic injuries in a crash similar to that which his father experienced, and undergoes bionic rebuilding which renders him more powerful than his bionic father. In exchange for Michael's operation, Austin agrees to return to OSI and his son also becomes an operative, though he did not appear in any subsequent films. In the second film, \"\", Austin is shown to be a senior OSI operative helping thwart a terrorist attack against an athletic event in Canada. \"Bionic Ever After?\", the final reunion film, saw Austin's bionics malfunctioning due to a computer virus, but in the end he is rescued by Jaime and the two finally marry as the film ends. Unlike Jaime, who undergoes an upgrade to her bionics in \"Bionic Ever After?\" which apparently adds new abilities, no such upgrade was ever evidenced for Austin in the telefilms, with the exception of an apparent enhancement to his bionic eye which is illustrated in \"Bionic Ever After?\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2005983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2005983", "title": "Cisco Catalyst", "text": "Cisco Catalyst\n\nCatalyst is the brand for a variety of network switches, wireless controllers and wireless access points sold by Cisco Systems. While commonly associated with Ethernet switches, a number of different network interfaces have been available throughout the history of the brand. Cisco acquired several different companies and rebranded their products as different versions of the Catalyst product line. The original Catalyst 5000 and 6000 series were based on technology acquired from Crescendo Communications. The 1700, 1900, and 2800 series Catalysts came from Grand Junction Networks, and the Catalyst 3000 series came from Kalpana in 1994.\n\nThe newest version of the Catalyst is the Catalyst 9000 family. The Catalyst 9000 family includes switches, wireless access points, and wireless controllers \n\nIn most cases, the technology for the Catalyst Switch was developed separately from Cisco's router technology. The Catalyst switches originally ran software called CatOS rather than the more widely known Cisco IOS software used by routers. However, this has changed as the product lines have merged closer together. In some cases, particularly in the modular chassis switches, a configuration called 'Hybrid' has emerged - this is where the layer 2 functions are configured using CatOS, and the layer 3 elements are configured using IOS. \"Native IOS\" can also be found with newer software versions that have eliminated CatOS entirely in favor of IOS, even on hardware that originally required CatOS.\n\nSome newer Catalyst switch models (with recent versions of the Cisco IOS) also allow web-based management using a graphical interface (GUI) module which is hosted on a HTTP server located on the switch. The Catalyst 2960-L SM Series of switches is an example of a Cisco Catalyst switch that allows this style of GUI via HTTP.\n\nCisco IOS, formally the Cisco Internetwork Operating System, is a family of network operating systems used on many Cisco Systems network switches, routers, wireless controllers and wireless access points. Earlier, Cisco switches ran CatOS. Cisco IOS is a package of routing, switching, internetworking and telecommunications functions integrated into a multitasking operating system. Although the IOS code base includes a cooperative multitasking kernel, most IOS features have been ported to other kernels such as QNX and Linux for use in Cisco products.\nCisco Catalyst products run IOS or a Linux-derived version called Cisco IOS XE. It was originally called \"XDI\" by the switching company Crescendo Communications, Inc. Cisco renamed it to \"CatOS\" when they acquired Crescendo and later still to Cisco IOS as the operating system was extended to other Cisco products. The newer Catalyst 9000 family uses the Cisco IOS XE operating system.\n\nAs Catalyst devices are primarily Ethernet switches, all modern Catalyst models have Ethernet interfaces ranging from 10 Mbit/s to 100 Gbit/s depending on the model. Other models can support T1, E1, and ISDN PRI interfaces to provide connections to the PSTN. Legacy models supported a variety of interfaces, such as token ring, FDDI, Asynchronous Transfer Mode and 100BaseVG, but are no longer sold by Cisco Systems.\nAll models have basic layer 2 functions and are capable of switching Ethernet frames between ports. Commonly found additional features are VLANs, trunking and QoS. The switches, whether IOS or IOS XE, are fully manageable.\n\nMany Catalyst switches that run IOS or IOS XE are also capable of functioning as a router, making them layer 3 devices; when coupled with TCP and UDP filtering, these switches are capable of layer 2-4 operation. Depending on the exact software image, a Catalyst switch that runs IOS or IOS XE may be able to tackle large-scale enterprise routing tasks, using router technologies like OSPF or BGP.\n\nModular chassis-based Catalyst switching models, like the Catalyst 9400 and 9600 Series, have the concept of field-replaceable supervisor, line cards, power supplies and fans. Mirroring most Cisco router designs, these work by separating the line cards, chassis, and supervisor engine. The chassis provides power and a high-speed backplane, the line cards provide interfaces to the network, and the supervisor engine moves packets, participates in routing protocols, etc. This gives several advantages:\n\nCatalyst switches offer advanced customization and manageability. The switches can be configured using a serial console, telnet or Secure Shell. Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) allows monitoring of many states, and measurement of traffic flows. Many devices can also run an HTTP server.\n\nConfiguration of the switch is done in plain text and is thus easy to audit. No special tools are required to generate a useful configuration. For sites with more than a few devices, it is useful to set up a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server for storing the configuration files and any IOS images for updating. Complex configurations are best created using a text editor (using a site standard template), putting the file on the TFTP server and copying it to the Cisco device. However, it can be noted that a TFTP server can present its own security problems.\n\nCisco StackWise and Stackwise Virtual are technologies offered by Cisco Systems that allows some models of Catalyst switches to operate as though they were one switch. One switch from the stack will act as the master switch. The master switch will maintain the stack and allow you to configure and monitor the whole stack as though one via a single console. This allows for more efficient management and typically provides more bandwidth between individual switches than other uplink technology.\n\nIf one switch fails, the remaining switches will continue to operate by bypassing it. If the master switch fails, another switch in the stack will automatically take over as master. This feature means greater redundancy, as one switch's failure will not bring about a failure of the entire stack.\n\nAs each switch contains the entire configuration for the stack, one of the benefits of this technology is the ability to replace a faulty switch (any—including master) with a new switch. The stack will configure the new switch on-the-fly to accommodate minimal downtime and reduce maintenance effort and errors.\n\nStackwise physically connects the switch stack using special stack interconnect cables, typically up to eight switches per stack. StackWise Virtual allows the virtual clustering of two chassis together into a single, logical entity without physical interconnect cables.\n\nThe master switch of a stack is determined in the following order:\n\nThere are two general types of Catalyst switches: fixed configuration models that are usually one or two rack units in size, with 12 to 80 ports; and modular switches in which virtually every component, from the CPU card to power supplies to switch cards, are individually installed in a chassis.\n\nIn general, switch model designations start with WS-C or C, followed by the model line (e.g. C9600). A letter at the end of this number signifies a special feature, followed by the number of ports (usually 24 or 48) and additional nomenclature indicating other features like UPOE (e.g. C9300-48U). Catalyst 9000 switches also include software subscription license indicators (e.g. C9200-48T-P, E for Essentials, A for Advantage and P for Premier)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCisco modular switches offer a configurable selection of chassis, power supplies, line cards and supervisor modules. Among Cisco's modular series are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He immigrated to Canada with his family at the age of six. They first moved to Edmonton, Alberta but after only a year relocated to Oakville, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto.\n\nHis exposure to bands such as the Dead Kennedys, Black Flag and Bad Brains inspired him to pick up the bass guitar at the age of fifteen. He quickly took to the instrument and within a few months had joined a Toronto punk band called Intensive Chaos. Primarily self-taught, Gordon continued to play in a string of basement bands and soon graduated to the independent scene where he started playing local gigs with Jonathan Cummins (Bionic, Doughboys), and Cam and Brad Maclean in Circus Lupus.\n\nAfter finishing high school, Gordon enrolled in the jazz program at Humber College to further his musical knowledge. Around the same time the demise of Circus Lupus led him to join the newly formed Rocktopus. Rocktopus released several independent cassettes and an EP on Lone Wolf Records. The band toured regularly across Ontario and Quebec and successfully completed two cross Canada and one North American tour before finally calling it quits.\n\nIn 1993, only one month after Rocktopus split, Gordon joined I Mother Earth, who had already signed a worldwide deal with Capitol records. A few short weeks after he joined the band, they embarked on a pre-album release tour across the United States. Gordon was credited with bass duty on 1993's \"Dig\", though he did not actually record it. However, he did record on 1996's \"Scenery and Fish\", 1999's \"Blue Green Orange\", and 2003's \"The Quicksilver Meat Dream\".\n\nIn 2003, the band parted ways to pursue different projects. Gordon expanded his teaching practice, both privately and at the Twelfth Fret, and began to explore new musical endeavors. He tried his hand at as many different musical styles as possible, including various jazz and blues artists, and for a year worked with songwriter Alison Maclean in her band Fourstar.

Gabe Kerbrat was their permanent roadie, and was considered a member. Within a year, the band had released two singles, \"Three Natural Sixes\" (Hopscotch Records #5) and \"Dance Hall Music\" (Empty Records MTR-354), and signed with the Die Young Stay Pretty label, a subsidiary of Sub Pop. Their self-titled debut album was released in 1997.\n\nIn 1998, the band released \"Empty Bottles, Broken Hearts,\" its second full-length album. This release saw a greatly increased use of electric organ, and in the same year they recruited Leslie Hardy as their full-time keyboard player. Hardy had previously played bass guitar for several Seattle bands, including several months in Hole. The Murder City Devils then embarked on a year-long tour of North America to support the record. During that tour, they played with At the Drive-In, Pearl Jam, The Black Halos, Modest Mouse (for whom Dann Gallucci also played guitar), and Built to Spill.\n\nAfter a short break, the band released \"In Name and Blood\" in 2000, with photos in the liner notes notoriously depicting every member as a murder victim. They also appeared as both individual actors as well as a band in David Larson's independent film \"The Edge of Quarrel\". \n\nThe band released the \"Thelema EP\" in 2001. Mid-tour, keyboardist Leslie Hardy left the band. Later that year the band broke up due to circumstances surrounding Hardy's departure. (\"The Stranger\" Sept 27 – Oct 3, 2001 issue, \"It's My Party\" column by Kathleen Wilson). Hardy was replaced by Nick Dewitt for their final concerts. Bassist Derek Fudesco agreed to leave the band in September 2001 to focus on his own new band, \"Pretty Girls Make Graves\".\n\nThe band's farewell concert on Halloween 2001 (October 31) at Seattle's Showbox Theater was recorded and released by Sub Pop in 2003, titled \"\"R.I.P.\"\" and included two previously unrecorded songs. It was also released on DVD in 2005.\n\nIn 2006 the band announced they were playing a July show in Seattle with all original members. The band performed on July 29 at the Capitol Hill Block Party closing the two-day music festival on Saturday night. The day following the Block Party performance the band played a show with The Blood Brothers at The Showbox in downtown Seattle, the same venue where \"R.I.P.\" was recorded. The show was not announced until the end of their set at the Block Party.\n\nThe next show was Saturday, November 3rd at Mowhawk in Austin, Texas with The Peabodys and Hex Dispensers while in town for Fun Fun Fun Fest, on November 3–4, 2007 in Austin, Texas. The band played a handful of shows throughout 2008 and launched a brief West Coast tour on February 11, 2009 at Seattle's The Showbox. Murder City Devils' week-long tour culminated in Los Angeles with two performances at the Henry Fonda Theater on February 17 and 18, 2009.\n\nAt the end of their set, on December 30, 2009, at The Showbox in Seattle, Washington, Hardy thanked the audience for coming and confirmed that the band was working on new material. No additional information was given. After the set finished, the band returned to the stage and performed a cover of The Birthday Party's song, \"Several Sins.\"\n\nOn July 17, 2010, a live performance of an untitled new song was uploaded to YouTube. It was filmed at their July 15, 2010, performance at The Note, in West Chester, Pennsylvania (a venue that has since closed).\n\nOn October 17, 2010, a live performance of another untitled new song was uploaded to YouTube. It was filmed at their October 16, 2010, performance at The Showbox in Seattle.\n\nIn January 2012, the band released a 7-inch with two new songs, recorded in San Pedro, California. The new songs were \"Every Day I Rise\" and \"Ball Busters in the Peanut Gallery\".\n\nOn August 5, 2014, the band released their first album in 11 years, \"The White Ghost Has Blood on Its Hands Again\", which includes eight songs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2005995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2005995", "title": "Dei gesta per Francos", "text": "Dei gesta per Francos\n\nDei gesta per Francos (\"Deeds of God through the Franks\") is a narrative of the First Crusade by Guibert of Nogent written between 1107 and 1108. Traditionally it has not been well received by scholars, but recent translators and editors (such as Levine 1997 and Rubenstein 2002) have shown it to contain important original material.\n\n\"Dei gesta\" was a radical departure for the type of literary work for Guibert who had previously worked on theological tracts. He decided to undertake a history of the crusade, he says, after he read an anonymous eyewitness account called \"Gesta Francorum\". In the eyes of Guibert this work was rough and simple and \"frequently left the reader stunned with its insipid vacuity\" (\"Dei gesta\", preface). Guibert felt a much higher standard of grammar and diction was needed. He also inserted into the account of the First Crusade anti-Jewish rhetoric. \n\nThere were some who believed it was best to leave the writing of history to those who had actually seen the events themselves, and thus were critical of Guibert's project. Guibert himself had said as much about 10 years earlier in a preachers manual. However he justified the book by saying if \"someone objects to me that I have not seen, he can not object that I have not heard—for I truly believe that hearing is, in a way, almost as good as seeing.\" (\"Dei gesta\", preface). Guibert personally knew crusaders, had grown up with crusaders, and had talked with them about their memories and experiences on their return.\n\nCrusade historians have traditionally not been forthcoming with favourable reviews of Guibert's narrative. The fact that he stays so close to the original \"Gesta Francorum\", and the difficulty of his Latin, make it seem superfluous. Recent editors and translators, however, have called attention to his excellent writing and original material. More importantly, \"Dei gesta\" provides invaluable information about the reception of the crusade in France, both for the general public and Guibert's own personal reactions to the stories he heard from returning crusaders.\n\nGuibert was a rare eyewitness to the preachings of Peter the Hermit for whom he felt nothing but contempt. The hermit, he says, walked barefoot and ate no bread, but he did drink wine and eat fish - criticism of an itinerant hermit from the monastic Guibert. When Peter fled the siege of Antioch, most chroniclers glossed over Peter's flight, but Guibert spared no measure when he wrote this mocking song, wondering why Peter could not withstand the starving pressures of a siege:\n\n\"Dei gesta\" was not only a historical narrative but contained moral instruction; the reader might learn lessons for his own spiritual quest. It also contained elements of prophecy, discussing how the crusade was part of the larger divine plan. Thus it was a medieval allegory work containing the four elements of allegory: literal, typological, moral, and anagogical. Like the Bible, it worked on different levels at the same time.\n\n\nSpecific\n"}

Spratling. After the deaths of Spratling's mother and sister, he moved to his father's boyhood home outside of Auburn, Alabama. Spratling graduated from Auburn High School and the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (currently known as Auburn University), where he majored in architecture.\n\nUpon graduation, Spratling took a position as an instructor in the architecture department at Auburn University, and in 1921 he was offered a similar position at Tulane University's School of Architecture in New Orleans, Louisiana. At the same time, he was an active participant in the Arts and Crafts Club and taught in the New Orleans Art School.\n\nDuring the summers of 1926-1928, Spratling lectured on colonial architecture at the National University of Mexico's Summer School.\n\nThe highly charged political and social environment in Mexico after the revolution influenced Spratling's decision in 1931 to reestablish a silver industry in Taxco. Taxco was a traditional site of silver mines, but had no native silverworking industry. Spratling began designing works in silver based primarily on pre-Columbian and traditional motifs, and hired local goldsmiths to produce those designs in Taxco. Spratling was the primary designer for his workshop, Taller de las Delicias, and was insistent on the high quality of the materials and techniques used in production. Talented \"maestros\" shared in the creative dialogue with Spratling, transforming his design drawings into prototypes in silver.\n\nSpratling's use of an aesthetic vocabulary based on pre-Columbian art can be compared to the murals of Diego Rivera, in that both artists were involved in the creation of a new cultural identity for Mexico. Primarily, Spratling's silver designs drew upon pre-conquest Mesoamerican motifs, with influence from other native and Western cultures. To many, his work served as an expression of Mexican nationalism, and gave Mexican artisans the freedom to create designs in non-European forms. Because of his influence on the silver design industry in Mexico, Spratling has been called the \"Father of Mexican Silver\".\n\nThe forms that evolved in silver at Las Delicias were admired by visitors to the workshop, who purchased the objects as talismans of a remote and exotic culture.\n\nIn the late thirties, Spratling expanded beyond sales at Las Delicias and into a wholesale business. He employed over 500 artisans in the workshop to meet the demand in the United States for luxury good during World War II. Spratling silver was sold through the Montgomery Ward catalog and at Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue. With the cost of moving the workshop to an ancient silver hacienda, La Florida, Spratling incorporated to provide cash flow for his company. On June 30, 1945, a majority of the shares was sold to North American investor Russell Maguire, whose business practices ultimately took the company into bankruptcy.\n\nSpratling had received widespread notoriety as a result of his development of what many considered a model handwrought industry. In 1945, Spratling was asked by two friends, Alaska's Territorial Governor, Ernest Gruening, and the Director of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board, Rene d'Harnoncourt, to replicate his success in Alaska. Spratling recommended the establishment of workshop and exhibit centers in various regions of Alaska organized into a Federation of Alaska Native Arts. Each center's unique production would be born out of the traditions in iconography, materials, and techniques belonging to that specific region. In 1948, Alaskan World War II veterans were sent to Taxco for instruction in silversmithing. Spratling also produced 200 prototypes as future inspiration for the newly trained Alaskans in their workshop centers. Unfortunately, Congress did not allocate funds and the project was not implemented.\n\nIn 1952, Spratling reestablished a small workshop at his ranch in Taxco el Viejo and began production of silver jewelry and decorative objects that clearly were influenced by his Alaskan experience. In a 1955 article, \"25 Years of Mexican Silverware,\" Spratling expressed his belief that the object in silver should be considered the culmination of a mystical and visionary process. For Spratling, the necessity of direct human involvement in every phase of a handwrought industry meant there were contributions to be made by every \"maestro\" and silversmith. The designer continuously interacted with and was aware of the capabilities of members of the workshop. The final statement, the object itself, was a result of an ongoing experiment in creativity.\n\nSpratling's earliest work can be characterized as inspired expressions in silver, resembling the power of the reliefs on the Temple of Quetzalcoatl at Xochicalco or the pre-Columbian clay stamps he admired. The designs incorporate sinuous lines that were deeply carved, with strong light and shadow contrasts. The inspiration from pre-Columbian models could be direct, as in the repousse Quetzalcoatl brooch, based on the heart bowl in the Museo Nacional de Antropología, or indirect, like the silver pitcher with the eagle handle in carved wood.\n\nSpratling marked his earliest work with a simple interlocking WS. After 1938, he began using a circular mark with the WS sans-serifs at its center, around which read \"Spratling Made in Mexico\". This mark was accompanied, up until 1945, with an oval in which was imprinted, \"Spratling Silver\". The Alaska pieces and work from c. 1950 were marked with a simple script \"WS\". Spratling also collaborated briefly (1949–51) with the Mexico City silver company Conquistador, and these pieces were marked with a circle in which was inscribed \"Spratling de [or of] Mexico\" and across, \"Sterling\". The eagle or assay mark for the Conquistador pieces contained the number 13, and for Spratling, the numbers 1 or 30.\n\nSpratling's later work is more linear and refined. The croissant necklace has a great deal of movement, but now based on abstract form. Spratling's maker's mark in this period once again took the form of a circle, this time with the script \"WS\" surrounded by the words, \"William Spratling Taxco Mexico\". In the 1960s, Spratling began producing jewelry in gold with pre-Columbian stones. Each piece was unique and marked with a simple \"WS\" beneath \"18K\".\n\n\nWhile teaching at Tulane, Spratling shared a house with writer William Faulkner.\n\nWhen lecturing at the National University of Mexico's Summer School in 1926-1928, Spratling quickly integrated himself into the Mexican art scene and became a friend and a strong proponent of the work of muralist Diego Rivera, for whom he organized an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Using money received from commissions he organized for Rivera, Spratling bought a home in Taxco, Mexico in 1928, where he began work on a book, \"Little Mexico\", about this small mountain town.\n\nSpratling was gay, but most accounts of his life mention this only indirectly if at all.\n\nSpratling amassed a large collection of pre-Columbian figurines from Remojadas, Veracruz, which he donated, in large part, to the museum of the National Autonomous University of Mexico in 1959. Photographed by Manuel Álvarez Bravo, several of these works were published in \"More Human Than Divine\". Spratling also donated hundreds of pre-Columbian objects to a museum in Taxco that today bears his name.\n\nSpratling was killed in an automobile accident outside of Taxco on August 7, 1967, at the age of 66. Sabina Leof (aka Tibby Leof, wife of noted Pre-Columbian art collector and preeminent dentist Dr Milton Arno Leof) commented on her friendship with Spratling: \"He had no political views, was not dedicated to anything special. He believed in humanity. He was an ardent American, but had a great love for the Mexican people.\"\n\nList of Mexican artisans\n\n\n"}

Among her extensive works are the dynamic roundels of Dance, Drama, and Song at Radio City Music Hall, the Creation cycle and stained-glass windows at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church (Manhattan), the iconographic suites at the Nebraska State Capitol, and the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nHildreth Meière was born in New York City in 1892. After studying at New York's Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart, Meiere studied in Florence. Upon studying the works of the Renaissance Masters, she is quoted as saying, \"After that I could not be satisfied with anything less than a big wall to paint on. I just had to be a mural painter.\"\n\nShe furthered her studies at the Art Students League of New York, California School of Fine Arts, San Francisco (now San Francisco Art Institute), the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, New York School of Applied Design for Women and the Beaux Arts Institute of Design. After training as a mapmaker, Meière served her country as a draftsman in the U.S. Navy during World War I.\n\nFinding work in a male-dominated field was difficult for her, so she began her career as a costume designer for theater actresses, a field more common for women at the time. In 1923 she was commissioned to decorate the dome of the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. by architect Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue. Meiere and sculptor Lee Lawrie became members of the loose \"repertory company\" of artists assembled by Goodhue, and she came to work on many different projects with him. One of these, the Nebraska State Capitol in Lincoln, which she began before the NAS dome was even completed, became her pièce de résistance featuring eight separate examples of her work.\n\nDuring Meiere's successful career, spanning 30 years and working on over 100 commissions, she became well known for contributing well-integrated public art mosaics to many landmark buildings and is most closely associated with the Art Deco movement. Some of Meiere's best work is visible throughout her hometown of Manhattan, although reportedly she was proudest of her work on the Nebraska State Capitol.\n\nWhen World War II broke out, Meiere served on the Citizen's Committee for the Army and Navy, providing portable altar pieces for military chaplains. This campaign created over 500 mobile triptychs, 70 of her own design which could be used on base-camps, battleships, and hospitals worldwide. She taught first aid for the Red Cross after the US entered World War II.\n\nAsked how to say her name, she told \"The Literary Digest\" (which spelled the name Meière) \"It is of French origin and I pronounce it \"mee-AIR\". My father's family anglicized the pronunciation to \"meer\", but I have always used the more proper form.\"\n\nIn Meiere's autobiography, she states, \"Having begun at the top with the National Academy of Sciences and the Nebraska State Capitol, the long list of commissions, well over a hundred, have come of themselves. For the past thirty-five years I have maintained a large studio and have supported myself by my work. . . . I have [also] been active in professional organizations, believing that we owe some of our time and energies to them.\"\n\nHer artistic merit was well recognised by her peers, but what makes her career most notable was the pioneering influence she had as a woman in a time where men dominated every profession. She was the first woman ever appointed to the New York City Art Commission, and she came to found the Liturgical Arts Society in her 57th Street studio in New York, serving as the organization's first president. She served four terms as President of the National Society of Mural Painters; six terms as First Vice President of the Architectural League of New York; Director of the Municipal Art Society; Director of the Department of Mural Painting at the Beaux Arts Institute of Design; member of the Architectural Guild of America; and a board member of the Art Students League, the Municipal Arts Society, the School Art League, and the Advisory Committee of the Cooper Union Art School, all in New York.\n\nHer first major award came in recognition for one of her first major projects. In 1928, a full six years before the Architectural League of New York admitted female members, the organisation awarded Meiere with a gold medal in Mural Decoration for her work at the Nebraska State Capitol.\n\nThe U.S. War Department gave her an award for the work she did with the Citizens Committee for the Army and Navy during World War II. In 1956, she became the first woman to win the Fine Arts Medal of the American Institute of Architects. Manhattanville College, Meiere's alma mater, presented her with an honorary doctorate in 1953, and in 1959 the school presented here with a distinguished service award.\n\n\n\n"}

He also gets along with Earth children, and saves them from danger, as he knows that children represent the Earth's future. After accomplishing his mission, Super Giant always flies back to the Emerald Planet.\n\nSuper Giant was played in all nine films by respected film/TV actor Ken Utsui. However, Utsui hated playing Super Giant and, right up to his death, always played down the role. This was partially on account of the somewhat embarrassing costume, especially the overstuffed crotch area (he said the producers thought that female viewers were attracted to well-endowed men, so they stuffed the crotch area of Utsui's costume with cotton).\n\n\"Super Giant\" (スーパー・ジャイアンツ 鋼鉄の巨人, \"Sūpā Jaiantsu\") a.k.a. \"The Steel Giant\", is a 1957 black and white Japanese film directed by Teruo Ishii. \n\nPlot: Super Giant first appears on Earth to stop foreign terrorists who threaten to destroy Japan (and the rest of the world) with an atomic bomb.

Rather than ask his guest questions that had any popular significance, or allow his guest to plug a current project, he would invariably act nervously, and simply describe scenes from a film in which the guest actor appeared (or occasionally films that had nothing to do with the guest). After asking the performer whether he remembered this particular event, Farley would relate, \"That was awesome.\" Other times, he would ask questions that were of little relevance, or made no sense at all. Invariably, he would say something he regretted and would smack his head and call himself an idiot. The skit accentuated Farley's shyness for comic effect.\n\nJeff Daniels was the first ever guest of \"The Chris Farley Show\" when it premiered on October 5, 1991. Daniels was appearing to promote his newest movie, \"The Butcher's Wife\". Daniels gives mostly yes or no answers to Farley's questions regarding whether or not he remembers certain scenes of movies. The episode also features a question from a caller, who mimics Farley's \"d'you remember\" questions. Eventually, Farley and the caller ignore Jeff Daniels and reminisce about the previous episode, in which the same caller asked Arnold Schwarzenegger a question.\n\nMartin Scorsese was the second guest on the show. Originally aired on November 16, 1991, Scorsese appeared to promote his film \"Cape Fear\". As with the first sketch, Farley introduces himself, stumbles over his words, and eventually discusses action movies with his guest before taking a caller. The caller asks Scorsese a question germane to filmmaking, but Farley remarks she called in before, on an unseen show where he interviewed Bruce Willis. The conversation steers back to action films, in this case a minor scene from \"Die Hard\", where Farley was impressed that John McClane had to make his way across a floor full of broken glass without shoes.\n\nIn the third and final \"Chris Farley Show\" sketch aired on February 13, 1993, Paul McCartney, that night's musical guest, was the guest on Farley's show. Farley acted awestruck and giddy in the former Beatle's presence, repeatedly asking ridiculous questions, typically starting with \"Do you remember when you were in The Beatles?\" or \"That was a hoax, right?\" in reference to rumors of McCartney's death, to which he gives one (or few) word answers. Farley attempts a serious question, asking about when the singer was arrested at Narita Airport for possession of marijuana, while McCartney replies he is ashamed and sensitive about that incident. Farley then says \"I am so stupid!\", and McCartney consoles him that being in show business he must face up to it, as he was asked the same question by Maria Shriver earlier. Farley then trails off, saying Shriver is married to Arnold Schwarzenegger, then asks, \"Did you see \"Terminator\"?\" This is the only \"Chris Farley Show\" sketch not to feature a guest caller, and as the scene fades out, Farley is conversing with McCartney recommending the Schwarzenegger film.\n\nA biographical novel named after the sketch, \"The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts\" was released on May 6, 2008 and was co-written by Tom Farley, Jr. (Chris Farley's brother) and Tanner Colby. It features anecdotes by his friends and family. The novel was named Amazon Best of the Month by Amazon.com in May, 2008. Co-author Colby is also credited with co-writing John Belushi's biography, \"Belushi: A Biography\". Farley was notorious for following in the footsteps of Belushi, both dying at age 33 from drug-related heart attacks.\n\n"}

{"id": "2006027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006027", "title": "Fresno FC U-23", "text": "Fresno FC U-23\n\nFresno Football Club U-23, formerly Fresno Fuego FC, was an American soccer team based in Fresno, California, United States. Founded in 2003, the team played in USL League Two, the fourth tier of the American Soccer Pyramid. The club drew an average home attendance of 3,951 in 2016, including league matches, divisional playoffs and exhibitions against professional clubs.\n\nFresno Fuego FC made their debut in PDL competition in 2003, having picked up the franchise rights in 2002 by then partners Jaime Marquez Sr., J. Francisco Alvarez, J. Antonio Alvarez & Jaime Marquez Jr. from the former PDL champions, the Central Coast Roadrunners from San Luis Obispo. Playing on the campus of San Joaquin Memorial High School, Fresno made a blistering start to their first campaign, scoring eight goals in back-to-back wins over Nevada Wonders, California Gold and Orange County Blue Star, with standout striker Orlando Ramirez. Fresno's impressive early season form also saw them qualify for the US Open Cup, where they made it all the way to the fourth round with victories over Chico Rooks, Utah Blitzz and El Paso Patriots, before they finally fell, 3–1, to Los Angeles Galaxy. Fresno's home form was superb during their first season, losing just one game – a 3–2 turnaround to California Gold – the entire year. Fuego's Latin American connection, led by Ramirez and Fabricio Codeceira was influential and by the end of their debut year they were sitting proudly atop the Southwest table, ahead of Orange County Blue Star on goal difference. The playoffs were a disappointment; after defeating Northwest champions Spokane Shadow, Fresno fell to Blue Star in the conference final.\n\n2004 saw the Fuego move to a new home at Fresno Pacific University, but the change did not affect their on-field performances, which included two 5–1 thrashings of the San Diego Gauchos, and nine-goal haul over 2 games against California Gold. Orlando Ramirez, Edgardo Contreras, Jose Luis Espindola and Milton Blanco continued their free-scoring exploits, and by the end of the 18-game season they finished just four points behind divisional champs Orange County Blue Star, and for the second year in a row made the playoffs. This time, however, Fuego took the conference title after wins over Cascade Surge and Blue Star. However, progress on the national stage eluded them, a 3–0 defeat to central conference champs Boulder Rapids Reserve ending their dreams of the PDL title. Nevertheless, two straight trips to the playoffs was impressive for a 2-year franchise.\n2005 saw expansion in the Southwest, and Fresno suffered a little. Despite opening strongly with 3 wins in their first 4 games, a mid-season slump saw them drop points against the Southern California Seahorses, California Gold and BYU Cougars. As a result, the gap between them and the divisional leaders – Blue Star and Seahorses – was too great, and despite winning 5 of their last 6 games – and scoring 15 goals in the process – they eventually finished third in the table. Veteran Edgardo Contreras and new signing Amaury Nunes were the top marksmen, knocking in 8 goals each, while Brazilian Fabricio Codeceira was a midfield dynamo, registering 7 assists for the season. Once again, Fresno's playoff campaign was a short one, falling to Orange County Blue Star in the first game.\n\n2006 was more difficult still for Fuego. First of all, they found themselves without a permanent home stadium, and instead were forced to travel all over the city – to Golden West High School and Central High School amongst others – in search of a pitch on which to play. Secondly, even more expansion in the division raised the level of competition considerably. Fresno stuttered inconsistently through their opening games, beating San Diego Gauchos 5–2, then losing, 4–0, to Los Angeles Storm, thrashing San Diego, 4–0, then losing, 4–1, to the expansion San Francisco Seals. Fabricio Codeceira and Amaury Nunes remained potent in front of goal, netting 18 times between them, but their spotty form was their downfall, and by the end of the season head coach Jaime Ramirez's men were a distant fifth behind league leaders Orange County Blue Star and Southern California Seahorses.\n\n2007 saw a huge change in fortunes for the Fuego. Before the season began the team signed a partnership with the AAA baseball franchise, the Fresno Grizzlies, resulting in cross-promotion, publicity, and a new home: Chukchansi Park in the heart of downtown Fresno. Buoyed by fan support which reached 3,000 spectators at home games, Fuego were resurgent: impressive early-season wins over the Southern California Seahorses and the San Fernando Valley Quakes kept them in the hunt for the playoffs, and their impressive home form meant that, by the end of the year, they were one of the four teams battling for the two playoff spots. A final-day 3–1 victory over the San Francisco Seals gave them the divisional title over the San Fernando Valley Quakes on goal difference; prolific Brazilian striker Pablo Campos scored two of his 18 goals, and cemented his position as the league-leading goalscorer. The playoffs, which were hosted by Fresno at Chukchansi, saw them demolish Tacoma Tide, 4–1, and then knock off Northwest champs BYU Cougars to take their second conference title; but once again their national challenge saw them fall at the first hurdle, losing, 1–0, to eventual PDL national champions Laredo Heat.\n\n2008 was a year of continued growth for Fuego in business terms, unveiling a new logo, and building on their new 3,000-strong fan base and their relationship with the Fresno Grizzlies at Chukchansi Park. On-field, the team stuttered slightly in the opening month of the season, winning just one of their first three games, 2–1, away at Southern California Seahorses. By mid-season, however, Fuego were burning up their opposition, with striker Pablo Campos continuing his free-scoring ways. He scored two in the 4–3 win over Orange County Blue Star, a hat trick in the 4–0 home win against Bakersfield Brigade, two more in the 4–1 demolition at Lancaster Rattlers, and another hat trick in the 6–2 annihilation of Los Angeles Legends in late June. By this time, Campos had been spotted by international scouts, and before the end of the month he was off to GAIS in Gothenburg, Sweden, to begin his professional career, leaving Fresno to find a replacement marksman. Campos's send-off was a disappointing one, with Fresno losing, 4–1, at home to Ventura County Fusion in his farewell game, and it was almost as though Campos' impending departure was affecting Fuego. They suffered another 4–1 home loss in July, this time to the San Fernando Valley Quakes, and by the time the season finale came down, Fuego's lead had been whittled away. The final regular season game, away at San Fernando Valley Quakes, was a winner-take-all game for the divisional title. The Quakes won it, 2–1, to take the championship, but Fresno made it through to the post-season to host the Western Conference championship for the second year in succession. Their first-round game was a rematch against Northwest Conference champions Tacoma Tide; however, without Campos's firepower, Fresno were toothless in attack, and eventually fell, 3–0. Despite leaving mid-season, Pablo Campos was still Fuego's top scorer with 14 goals, while the ever-dependable Fabricio Codeceira contributed 13 assists.\n\nFresno suffered one of their worst seasons in several years in 2009. A general lack of firepower – the result of losing Pablo Campos and Amaury Nunes to the professional ranks – and a frustrating tendency to inconsistency kept the Fuego on the back from their opening game, which they lost, 1–0, to divisional new boys Hollywood United Hitmen. Fuego bounced back with a 3–0 win over the Los Angeles Legends, and played Lancaster Rattlers to an astonishing 5–5 tie at the end of May where they were 4–0 down at half time, fought back to lead, 5–4, only to concede a last minute equalizer. The season's high point was the 5–1 hammering of Orange County Blue Star in June in which Santiago Aguilera Navarro his a brace; the low point was the 7–1 annihilation they suffered at the hands of the Legends at home a week later. A middling run through the middle part of the season left Fuego playing catchup as July began, and despite winning three of their final five games – including a 3–0 victory over local rivals Bakersfield Brigade and a 3–1 final day victory over divisional champions Hollywood, they finished the season in fifth place, out of the playoffs for the first time in three seasons. Tyler Reinhart and Paul Islas were Fresno's top scorers, with 5 goals each.\n\n2010 was a season of two halves for Fresno. The first half of the season was generally poor. They lost their opening game of the season, 3–0, to the Hollywood United Hitmen, bounced back to beat the Ogden Outlaws, 4–0, but then were annihilated, 7–2, by Orange County Blue Star. The season's nadir came in the return game against Orange County in early June when the Fuego, 3–0 up after 52 minutes, fell apart and somehow managed to lose, 4–3, thanks to a hat trick from OC's striker Amani Walker. Things began to change in mid-June thanks to an impressive 4–1 away win over the Lancaster Rattlers; following this victory, Fuego embarked on a marvellous 8-game unbeaten streak to the end of the season, comprising 6 wins and 2 ties. Milton Blanco scored a 90th-minute winner in a seesaw 4–3 victory over the Southern California Seahorses which saw three red cards. They came back from a 2–1 deficit to beat Los Angeles Azul Legends, 3–2, in early July, in a game which saw the Legends reduced to 8 men in the second half, and wiped the floor with Lancaster on the final day of the regular season with a 7–0 victory in which second-half substitute Gabriel Gonzalez hit a hat trick. Unfortunately for Fresno their early season form proved to be their undoing, and despite rising from the bottom of the table, eventually finished fourth in the division, and out of the playoffs. Veteran Fuego midfielder Fabricio Codeceira was the team's top performer, with 10 goals and 7 assists on the season.\n\nIn 2017, Fresno Fuego FC were acquired by Fresno FC. Fresno Fuego FC were renamed Fresno FC U-23 on February 8, 2018. Also announced that day is the team will wear the colors of their parent club Fresno FC.\n\nOn February 1, 2019 the Fresno FC, parent of Fresno FC U-23 places the team on hiatus until the club has its own facility.\n\n\"This list of notable former players comprises players who went on to play professional soccer after playing for the team in the Premier Development League, or those who previously played professionally before joining the team.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2006042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006042", "title": "Stock Generation", "text": "Stock Generation\n\nStock Generation was a website that ran from 1998 to early 2000 and is now part of Internet lore as the longest-running, most infamous Ponzi scheme in the history of the Internet. Stock Generation allowed people to trade \"virtual companies\" using real money and promised enormous returns on investment.\n\nThe website was run from an island in the Caribbean, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was unable to cite Stock Generation's founders and owners (members of the Russian conglomerate MMM) for securities violations. In late 1999, participants began to experience difficulties in redeeming their virtual shares. Finally, in 2000, the market \"crashed\". On March 20, 2000, SG unilaterally suspended all pending requests to withdraw funds and sharply reduced participants' account balances in all companies except the privileged company. (Applying \"Rule 13\" to all participants' accounts.) Two weeks later, SG peremptorily announced a reverse stock split for its highest-yield company, applying \"Rule 18\", which caused the share prices to plummet to less than 1/10,000 of their previous values, while other shares (including those that were \"guaranteed\" not to decrease in value) were devalued by 50% to 95%. At about the same time, SG stopped responding to participant requests for the return of funds, yet continued to solicit new participants through its website.\n\nThe SEC then sued in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that the \"virtual stock exchange\" was in effect a Ponzi scheme. The court ruled in favor of Stock Generation, stating that the site adequately described the market as \"a game\" not an investment vehicle. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit later reversed the District Court, stating that \"the opportunity to invest in the shares of the privileged company, described on SG's website, constituted an invitation to enter into an investment contract within the jurisdictional reach of the federal securities laws.\" The game was shut down around June 1, 2000.\n\nStockGeneration website traded shares of 11 \"virtual\" companies. Each of those companies had its name and logo, but they were most often referred to by the number under which they were listed.\n\nCompanies 1 to 8 were traded for purely \"gambling\" purposes, as their shares could go up and down randomly. Having those 8 companies \"trading\" on their website, allowed StockGeneration to claim its enterprise as online gambling venture, rather than an actual stock market or any other investment-related business to which SEC rules would apply.\n\nCompany 9 was the \"privileged\" company, with its shares \"guaranteed\" never to decrease in value. Promised return was originally 10% a month (215% annually,) but was later reduced to 7% a month or 125% annually. In early April 2000, Stock Generation, despite all previous guarantees, devalued its privileged company shares to 5% of their previous value.\n\nCompanies 10 and 11 promised monthly returns of 50% and 100% (later 40% and 70%) respectively. At the same time, share prices could plummet 50% for company 10 and 100% (e.g. all the way down to 0) for company 11. That caveat (known as Rule 18) was another way for StockGeneration to justify their claims that this was a gambling website, rather than an investment vehicle.\n\nStock Generation was reluctant to use Rule 18 throughout most of the time the game was active. Instead they chose to apply another rule (known as Rule 13) which permitted StockGeneration to reduce individual account balances by recalculating them as if all the funds had been originally invested in the \"privileged\" company 9. So, a user that chose to invest his $50 sign-up bonus in the company 11 shares, kept the funds there for a year and then sought to withdraw all at once, could see his balance going down from $204,800 (100% monthly rate, compounded twice a week) to $157 (10% monthly rate compounded twice a week) and his transaction history would state that he had invested all those funds in the company 9 shares rather than in the company 11.\n\nRule 13 allowed StockGeneration to avoid massive 5- or 6- figure withdrawals, thus allowing the system to last over 2 years, with its share prices increasing over 10,000-fold. (As opposed to StockGeneration predecessor, the MMM which only lasted about 6 months, with its stock price increasing \"only\" 127-fold.) Judging from the complaints on the SG bulletin board, application of rule 13 had become widespread by early 2000, as demands for withdrawals increased. On March 20, 2000, Rule 13 was applied to every account.\n\nRule 18 was applied about two weeks later, for the first time since the game was launched. The value of the company 10 share was cut in half. Company 11 shares underwent a 1-for-10,000 reverse split, with the actual share price plummeting to less than 1/100,000th of its value (from over $1 per share to $0.10 per \"new\" share, worth 10,000 old ones). On the same day, Stock Generation reduced the price of the company 9 shares from $16.90 to $0.84 - in clear violation of their own rules as those shares were guaranteed never to decrease in value.\n\nStock Generation continued to operate for several weeks after that, offering returns of up to 150% a month, but further legal troubles led to their website being halted by June 1, 2000.\n\nThe description below is a quotation of the public information from the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\n\n\"StockGeneration\" website offering on-line denizens an opportunity to purchase shares in eleven different \"virtual companies\" listed on the website's \"virtual stock exchange.\" SG arbitrarily set the purchase and sale prices of each of these imaginary companies in biweekly \"rounds,\" and guaranteed that investors could buy or sell any quantity of shares at posted prices. SG placed no upper limit on the amount of funds that an investor could squirrel away in its virtual offerings.\n\nThe SEC's complaint focused on shares in a particular virtual enterprise referred to by SG as the \"privileged company\". SG advised potential purchasers to pay \"particular attention\" to shares in the privileged company and boasted that investing in those shares was a \"game without any risk.\" To this end, its website announced that the privileged company's shares would unfailingly appreciate, boldly proclaiming that \"[t]he share price of [the privileged company] is supported by the owners of SG, this is why its value constantly rises; on average at a rate of 10% monthly (this is approximately 215% annually).\" To add plausibility to this representation and to allay anxiety about future pricing, SG published prices of the privileged company's shares one month in advance.\n\nWhile SG conceded that a decline in the share price was theoretically possible, it assured prospective participants that \"under the rules governing the fall in prices, [the share price for the privileged company] cannot fall by more than 5% in a round.\" To bolster this claim, it vouchsafed that shares in the privileged company were supported by several distinct revenue streams. According to SG's representations, capital inflow from new participants provided liquidity for existing participants who might choose to sell their virtual shareholdings. As a backstop, SG pledged to allocate an indeterminate portion of the profits derived from its website operations to a special reserve fund designed to maintain the price of the privileged company's shares. SG asserted that these profits emanated from four sources: (1) the collection of a 1.5% commission on each transaction conducted on its virtual stock exchange; (2) the bid-ask spread on the virtual shares; (3) the \"skillful manipulation\" of the share prices of eight particular imaginary companies, not including the privileged company, listed on the virtual stock exchange; and (4) SG's right to sell shares of three other virtual companies (including the privileged company). As a further hedge against adversity, SG alluded to the availability of auxiliary stabilization funds which could be tapped to ensure the continued operation of its virtual stock exchange.\n\nSG's website contained lists of purported \"big winners,\" an Internet bulletin board featuring testimonials from supposedly satisfied participants, and descriptions of incentive programs that held out the prospect of rewards for such activities as the referral of new participants (e.g., SG's representation that it would pay \"20, 25 or 30% of the referred player's highest of the first three payments\") and the establishment of affiliate websites.\n\nAccording to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit, 800 United States domiciliaries, paying real cash, purchased virtual shares in the virtual companies listed on the defendants' virtual stock exchange.

He is best known for having lost 27 consecutive games in which he had a decision, setting an MLB record.\n\nYoung attended Furr High School in Houston, Texas, and the University of Houston, where he played college baseball and college football for the Houston Cougars. The New York Mets selected Young in the 38th round of the 1987 Major League Baseball draft. He worked his way up through their minor league system, making his major league debut as a relief pitcher on August 5, 1991.\n\nWhile with the Mets, from May 6, 1992, to July 24, 1993, he lost 27 consecutive decisions. This losing streak is the longest in MLB history, breaking the mark of 23 set by Cliff Curtis in 1910–11. During the losing streak, Young converted 12 straight save opportunities and threw consecutive scoreless innings while filling in for Mets closer John Franco. During the streak, Young was 0–14 as a starter and 0–13 as a reliever. The streak ended on July 28, 1993, when he earned his first win since April 19, 1992.\n\nOver roughly the same time period from April 14, 1992, to May 1, 1994, Young—as a Met and later a Cub—made 27 consecutive starts without a win. He made 13 quality starts among those 27, but his teams went 4–23 in those games. Before the 1994 season, the Mets traded Young and minor leaguer Ottis Smith to the Chicago Cubs for José Vizcaíno. He signed with the Houston Astros for the 1996 season. Despite posting a respectable 3.89 earned run average for his career, he finished with a record of 15 wins and 48 losses for a winning percentage of .238.\n\nAfter retiring, Young worked for eight years in a chemical plant. He also coached youth leagues and offered pitching lessons in Kingwood, Texas. He was the father of three.\n\nIn January 2017, Young revealed that he had been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor. Doctors were unsure at the time if the tumor was malignant. He underwent chemotherapy and reported in February that the tumor had shrunk. On June 27, 2017, his ex-teammate, Lenny Harris, reported on social media that Young was in a coma.

It was established on 4 October 1904, and functions as an alliance association () for clubs in six different sports, and cooperates with a separate organisation in a seventh sport. The club is best known for its professional football team, one of the most successful in the Nordic countries.\n\nIFK Göteborg was founded on 4 October 1904 as the third iteration of an Idrottsföreningen Kamraterna association in Gothenburg, the previous two start-ups in 1895 and 1897 did not live for long. While most members focused on football from the start in 1904, committees were also created for winter sports and parties. The club was founded at Café Olivedal, a café in the Linnéstaden district, and most sports activities at the start were held on nearby Karlsrofältet or in the area that today is the Gothenburg Botanical Garden. From its inception until 31 December 2017, all sections were part of the same organisation. Starting on 1 January 2018, all sections became separate organisations, under a parent organisation called \"IFK Göteborg\". The previous organisation number was taken over by the new football organisation.\n\nAthletics has been present within IFK Göteborg since the start, and the first footballers also were successful athletes. The section won its first Olympic medal through Charles Luther at the 1912 Summer Olympics. Long distance runner Eric Backman, with four Olympic medals at the 1920 Summer Olympics, also competed for IFK Göteborg. IFK was the best club overall at the 1957 Swedish Championships in athletics, and the period from 1985 to 1995 was one of the most successful in terms of medals won, including hurdler Robert Kronberg who competed for IFK Göteborg in his youth years. The main focus of the section since 2000 has been youth development, with the section operating mainly at Slottsskogsvallen and Friidrottens Hus in western Gothenburg.\n\nThe bowling section traces its origins back to the 29 August 1917, when Kägelklubben IFK was founded. This club was incorporated as a section of IFK Göteborg in 1931. The IFK bowler Gösta Algeskog won two gold medals (individual and 8-man team) at the first World Tenpin Bowling Championships in 1954, silver the following year, and another gold in the 8-man discipline in 1958. The most successful female Swedish bowler of all time, Åsa Larsson, represented IFK from 1987 to 2002, winning the World Tenpin Bowling Championships in 1983 (5-man team) and the World Cup in 1991, in addition to a number of gold medals at the European Championships.\n\nThe cross-country skiing section was created in 1967, and has mainly seen local success, with the best position in a Swedish championship competition being a 14th place in ski-orienteering. On district level, IFK skiers won 34 championships in the first 20 years of the section, almost half of the titles in ski-orienteering. A major goal for many of the section members is Vasaloppet, and in recent times between 10–15 skiers usually have competed for IFK Göteborg in the races each year. Skiing on the west coast of Sweden can be a challenge due to lack of snow, Prioritet Serneke Arena with its newly built all-season indoor skiing trail may mend the situation somewhat.\n\nThe football section has won 18 Swedish championship titles, seven national cup titles, and is the only club in the Nordic countries that has won a pan-European competition, as the club won the UEFA Cup in 1982 and 1987. IFK is the most popular football club in Sweden, with diverse country-wide support. IFK Göteborg play in the highest Swedish league, Allsvenskan, where they have played for the majority of their history. They have played in the Swedish first tier continuously since 1977. The club won its first Swedish championship in 1908, and has won at least one championship title in all decades since, except the 1920s, 1970s and 2010s. IFK Göteborg's most successful period was from 1982 to 1996, when the team prospered in European football and won 10 out of 15 Swedish championships. The current home ground is Gamla Ullevi.\n\nIFK Göteborg first competed in orienteering in 1921, and is one of Sweden's oldest orienteering clubs, but a separate section was not created until 1945. Many successful orienteers have competed for the section, including world champions (at the time they ran for IFK) Torben Skovlyst, Chris Terkelsen, Jamie Stevenson, and François Gonon, as well as individual Swedish champions , , , and Jenny Johansson. IFK Göteborg also has won the Swedish relay championships, in 2000 and 2002. IFK Göteborg has won the two most prestigious club relay competitions in the world in recent years. Tiomila in Sweden was won in 2015, 2017 and 2018 (finishing second in 2016), and the Jukola relay in Finland was won in 2017 (which was the first victory by a Swedish club in 25 years).\n\nEven though the first club competition in speed skating was arranged already in January 1905, it was not until 1956 that speed skating got its own section within IFK Göteborg. Three years later the section had over 100 members and arranged the 1959 European Speed Skating Championships for Men together with IK Wega. Manne Lavås became the first olympian of the section, competing both at the 1964 and 1968 Winter Olympics. Two other well-known IFK speed skaters are Ann-Sofie Järnström and Jasmin Krohn, the later winning 38 Swedish championships for IFK Göteborg. The section has its home at Ruddalens IP's skating rink, which was rebuilt to an indoor hall in 2002.\n\nThe club has also competed in korgboll (a predecessor to korfball), handball, wrestling, weightlifting, bandy and tennis.\n\nIn October 2015, futsal club Göteborg Futsal Club (founded in 2007) initiated a cooperation with IFK Göteborg, changing its name to IFK Göteborg Futsal. The club has a men's team playing in the Swedish Futsal League, claiming three championship titles as of 2016. The women's team IFK Göteborg Futsal Dam is playing in a regional league. Both teams play their home matches in Prioritet Serneke Arena.\n\nIFK Göteborg cooperated with the ice hockey club BK Bäcken from 1975 on, as part of the umbrella organisation Föreningen Göteborgsidrott (handball club IK Heim was another member). BK Bäcken changed their colours to blue and white and also changed the name to IFK Bäcken in line with the agreement, but were never part of IFK Göteborg. Bäcken changed its name to Gothia HC in 1990 before changing name once again in 1994 to Bäcken HC.\n"}

After an initial education in his home state, he continued his studies, according to Houbraken, with Hendrick Goltzius in Haarlem and Amsterdam. Around 1620 he travelled through Paris to Venice. He moved to Rome around 1620–1622, and his first works there were influenced by the style of Caravaggio.\n\nAlthough his earlier work was concerned with the contrasts of light and shadow, his final move to Venice in the early 1620s modified his style and gave impetus to brilliant color and a spirited treatment of the painted surface. In 1627, he was created an admired large altarpiece, the \"Inspiration of Saint Jerome\" in San Nicolò da Tolentino. His loose brushstrokes seem precursor to rococo styles of Guardi brothers. This final style, along with that of other \"foreign\" painters residing in Venice, Domenico Fetti and Bernardo Strozzi, represent the first inroads of Baroque style into the republic.\n\nLiss fled to Verona to escape the plague spreading in Venice, but succumbed there prematurely in 1629. According to Houbraken, he worked day and night on his paintings, so that Joachim von Sandrart felt that his health was at risk and urged him to join him in Rome.\n\nHis legacy is as a painter of both sensuous mythological and pious biblical subjects, a master of colors and Baroque painting. He was most influential to Venetian 18th-century painters like Sebastiano Ricci, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Giovanni Piazzetta.\n\nJoachim von Sandrart wrote in 1675 that \"because he fared well in Venice, he soon returned there ... he died along with many others during the plague that began in 1629.\"\n\n\n"}

The bridge was formerly called the Cedar Avenue Bridge from days prior to the construction of the I-35W bridge when it connected to Cedar Ave. The bridge connects 10th Avenue Southeast, on the east side of the Mississippi River to 19th Avenue South, on the west side. The bridge is considered the crowning achievement of Minneapolis city engineer Kristoffer Olsen Oustad, who was one of four prominent Norwegian-American men who designed major structures in the region. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989, and also marks the downstream boundary of the Saint Anthony Falls Historic District. During the days immediately following the I-35W bridge collapse, the 10th Avenue Bridge was closed to traffic, then later reopened; it was one of the most used locations from which to view the wreckage and the recovery efforts.\n\nConstruction on the bridge began in 1926, and it was completed in 1929. The total length is 2,174.9 feet (662.9 m), with two central spans each 265.5 feet (80.9 m) across. It has an open spandrel arch design, and it is constructed of reinforced concrete. Higher and longer than any preceding bridge in the region, it was originally 2,921 feet (890.3 m) in overall length, 698 feet (213 m) longer than the nearby Third Avenue Bridge. It stands 110 feet (33.5 m) above the water's surface. Cost of the bridge was US$891,000. A major restoration was undertaken in 1972–1976, and the approach spans were altered (they were not considered architecturally significant, even when the bridge was new). The south approach span was relocated to go straight to Washington Avenue.\n\nIt was built to alleviate the traffic flows on the bridges serving downtown about a mile upstream. Roads in the vicinity were disrupted by the construction of Interstate 35W and a corresponding bridge (completed 1967; collapsed in 2007) one to two blocks upstream (the famous Seven Corners area of Minneapolis is at the south end). The downstream end of the lower Saint Anthony Falls lock and dam extends under the bridge. The historic Southeast Steam Plant is also nearby.\n\n"}

Being a four-time winner of the AEGON Awards, she was also a long-term British No. 1, a position she held intermittently from 2002 to 2012. However, as a result of her absence from competition due to knee surgery, she dropped down the world rankings and at the time of her retirement on 18 November 2013, she was ranked as the world No. 221 and British No. 6. Her career-high ranking of world No. 49 was achieved in September 2010.\n\nOver the course of her career, she won eleven ITF singles titles (five $25k, two $50k, two $75k, and two $100k) and four ITF doubles titles (all $25k). She was also a runner-up in three ITF events in singles and four in doubles. In 2010, Baltacha had victories over top 10-players, including two victories over Li Na (the second of which came via retirement) and one against Francesca Schiavone, who at the time was the reigning French Open champion. In 2011, Baltacha won her highest ranked tournament on the ITF circuit, the 2011 Aegon Nottingham Challenge.\n\nBaltacha was diagnosed with liver cancer in January 2014, just a few weeks after her marriage to tennis coach Niño Severino. She died on 4 May 2014, aged 30.\n\nBorn in Kiev, Ukraine, Baltacha moved with her family following a transfer of football clubs by her professional footballer father, Sergei. He represented the Soviet Union and played in the United Kingdom for Ipswich Town, St Johnstone and Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Her mother Olga was a sportswoman. Her brother Sergei played football for St Mirren and Millwall.\n\nAfter arriving at Heathrow Airport on 13 January 1989, Baltacha moved to Ipswich where her father was to play football for the next year before moving to Perth, Scotland, where she grew up and spent some of her teenage years, before moving to Paisley, Scotland, and attending Castlehead High School.\n\nResident in Ipswich, on 8 December 2013, a month after her retirement from tennis, she married her coach Niño Severino, a retired professional tennis coach turned multi-sports specialist in mental and movement training coach, who also works with Ipswich Town F.C. and in coaching martial arts athletes. In 2010 the couple formed the Elena Baltacha Academy of Tennis, which is still run by Niño and based around the facilities at Ipswich Sports Club, where she trained during her career.\n\nAt the age of 19, she was diagnosed with the liver condition primary sclerosing cholangitis and in June 2010 she became patron of the Children's Liver Disease Foundation. Baltacha was diagnosed with liver cancer in January 2014. She died from the disease on 4 May 2014 at the age of 30. Several players paid tribute to Baltacha on Twitter including Grand Slam champions Martina Navratilova, Serena Williams, Billie Jean King, Maria Sharapova, Victoria Azarenka, Kim Clijsters, Petra Kvitová, Marion Bartoli, Chris Evert, Sam Stosur and Svetlana Kuznetsova. A host of ATP and WTA tennis players past and present came together on the centre court at the Madrid Open as a mark of respect for Baltacha. Baltacha's funeral took place on 19 May and was attended by Tim Henman, Annabel Croft, Laura Robson, Jo Durie and Judy Murray among others. Mourners were asked to wear bright colours instead of black and to donate to Rally for Bally rather than buying flowers. The money was to be split equally between the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity and the Elena Baltacha Academy of Tennis, which she set up to help disadvantaged children take up the sport. Baltacha is interred in the Ipswich Millennium Cemetery.\n\nIn May 2015, it was announced that the trophy at the Aegon Open was to be named the \"Elena Baltacha trophy\" in her honour.\n\nBaltacha played her first match on the ITF junior circuit in February 1997 and her last at the 2001 US Open junior tournament. She never won a title but reached the final of two junior tournaments, at the 14th Bahia Junior Cup and at the LTA International Junior Tournament, Bisham Abbey. Baltacha also reached the semifinals of three tournaments and the quarterfinals of six others. In 2001, she reached the semifinals of the Wimbledon juniors championships where she was beaten by eventual champion Angelique Widjaja. Over the course of her career as a junior, she gained wins over players such as Svetlana Kuznetsova, Gisela Dulko (twice) and Anne Keothavong. Her career-high singles ranking was world number 77 and her final singles win-loss record was 40–40. Aside from junior ITF events, Baltacha also competed in the Commonwealth Youth Games in 2000, representing Scotland, and won a silver medal alongside Karen Paterson and Mhairi Brown in the women's team event.\n\nAs a doubles competitor, Baltacha won four tournaments and lost in the final of four more. She also lost in the semifinal stages of tournaments four times and the quarterfinals eight times. Her final doubles win-loss record was 37–30 and her career-high doubles ranking was world number 60.\n\nIn November 1997, Baltacha made her debut on the ITF circuit in Edinburgh where she was beaten in the first round of the qualifying stages in three sets by Danica Kovakova. She did however reach the quarterfinals of the doubles tournament. She played only three adult ITF tournaments in 1998 (Birmingham, Southsea and Glasgow, all $10k events) and lost in the qualifying stages for each of them. 1999 saw her first ITF main draw appearances. She competed in four tournaments in total and reached the quarterfinals of the $10k tournament in Glasgow.\n\nIn April 2000, she reached the quarterfinals of the $10k tournament in Bournemouth as a qualifier. Baltacha was given a wild card into the qualifying draw of her home Grand Slam, Wimbledon, where Flavia Pennetta beat her in three sets. In October she received another wild card, this one into the Swisscom Challenge, a Tier-I event held in Zürich. The very next week she was a quarterfinalist at the $50k tournament in Cardiff. Her season ending singles ranking was world number 397.\n\nBaltacha reached the quarterfinals of her first tournament of the year in January, a $10k tournament in Jersey, when she was forced to retire early in the second set. She was out of action until late April when she reached the quarterfinals of the $10k tournament in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Two weeks later she reached the quarterfinals of the $25k tournament in Edinburgh as a qualifier. She followed this up with a run to the semifinals of the $25k event in Surbiton. She was then given a wild card into the qualifying draw for the Tier-II event in Eastbourne, the Aegon International where she beat Frenchwoman Virginie Razzano, in the final round of qualifying to reach the main draw. Conchita Martínez beat her in the first round. Just a week later she was given a wild card into the main draw of Wimbledon to give her the first appearance in the main draw of a Grand Slam. She was beaten by Nathalie Dechy in round one. Following Wimbledon she reached yet another ITF quarterfinal; this one in a $25k tournament in Felixstowe. She lost in round one of the qualifying tournament for the US Open in August and competed in four more ITF tournaments, reaching the quarterfinals of two of them (both $25k). She ended the year with a singles ranking of world number 248.\n\nIn February 2002, Baltacha reached the quarterfinals of the $25k tournament in Sutton, London. She played for Great Britain in the Fed Cup in April and won her singles rubber against Norway's Annette Aksdal. She then beat Lina Stančiūtė from Lithuania in the relegation play-offs in three sets. Following this she attempted to qualify for the Tier III Croatian Bol Ladies Open where she was beaten in round one of the qualifying draw. This was the first of a string of five consecutive losses, the last of which was in the first round of the qualifying draw for the DFS Classic, a Tier-III event. She broke this string of losses with a win over Alina Jidkova in round one of the qualifying draw for the Tier II Aegon International. She was beaten by Elena Likhovtseva in the second round of qualifying. She was then given a wild card into the main draw of Wimbledon where she beat María Vento-Kabchi in the first round and Amanda Coetzer in the second round before losing to Elena Likhovtseva (for the second time in two consecutive tournaments) in the third round.\n\nHer next tournament after Wimbledon was the $25k event in Felixstowe which she won by beating Irishwoman Kelly Liggan in the final to give her the first ITF singles title of her career. Two weeks later, she won her second title in Pamplona, again $25k, when she defeated Virginie Pichet in the final. After this she attempted to qualify for the US Open but lost in the first round of the qualifying tournament for the second consecutive year. She played two more $25k tournaments after the US Open, Glasgow and Southampton, where she reached the semifinals and quarterfinals respectively. Her season ending ranking for 2002 was world number 157.\n\nBaltacha's 2003 season started slowly; she lost in round one of the qualifying tournament for the first Grand Slam of the year, the Australian Open. In April she was again part of the Great Britain Fed Cup team but lost her only match against Hungary's Petra Mandula. She spent May failing to qualify for the Tier-III tournament, the Internationaux de Strasbourg and French Open. In June she was given a wild card into the main draw of the DFS Classic but was forced to retire during her first round match against fellow Brit Jane O'Donoghue after the first game of the final set. She was then awarded another wild card; this one into the qualifying draw of the Tier II Aegon International where she was beaten by Virginie Razzano. For the third year running, she received a wild card into the main draw of Wimbledon where she forced the former world number 5, Jelena Dokić, to fight for her eventual three-set victory. This was Baltacha's final match of the year as she underwent invasive surgery after Wimbledon (to determine the cause of her persistent liver troubles) which put her out of action until 2004. As a result, her year-end singles ranking fell to world number 373.\n\nBaltacha returned to action in January 2004, reaching the semifinals of her first two ITF tournaments of the year. These were the $10k event in Kingston upon Hull and the $25k event in Sunderland. She played in the Fed Cup for the Great Britain Fed Cup team where she won her two singles rubbers against Turkey and Romania by beating Cigdem Duru and Monica Niculescu respectively. She also beat Irishwoman Yvonne Doyle in the Europe/Africa Group II play-offs. In June, Samantha Stosur beat her in the first round of the DFS Classic and Cara Black beat her in the final round of the qualifying tournament for the Aegon International one week later. Baltacha then headed to Wimbledon main draw courtesy of another wild card. She demolished world number 61, Marta Marrero in round one before falling to three-time Grand Slam champion, Jennifer Capriati in the second round.\n\nBetween Wimbledon and the US Open qualifying tournament (where she reached the second round before being beaten by Angelique Widjaja), she suffered three consecutive first-round losses in $50k tournaments in the United States. After the US Open she reached the final of a $25k event in Jersey where she was beaten by Emma Laine. She spent the remainder of her year competing on the ITF circuit and her year-end singles ranking rose to world number 202.\n\nIn the 2005 Australian Open qualifying tournament, she won three matches in straight sets to qualify; she beat Els Callens, Jaslyn Hewitt and Teryn Ashley in rounds one, two and three respectively. In the first round of the main draw, she beat Katarina Srebotnik who later remarked that the Brit was \"on fire\" and that \"if [Elena] plays like today, she can beat anyone. Some of the shots she was hitting were unbelievable.\" She continued her winning streak with another three-set victory in round two, this one over Frenchwoman Stéphanie Cohen-Aloro. Unfortunately for Baltacha, she ran out of steam in the third round, losing to number 15 seed, Silvia Farina Elia. She used her momentum from her good performance in the first Grand Slam of the year to carry her to the semifinals of her next tournament, a $25k event in Sunderland where she lost to Sofia Arvidsson. She then immediately reached the final of another $25k event (this one in Redbridge, London) before being beaten by Nika Ožegović. She again played for Great Britain in the Fed Cup. She lost her singles rubber against Ana Timotić from Serbia, won her singles rubber against Karina-Ildor Jacobsgaard and was demolished in her third singles rubber against Katarina Srebotnik in retribution for her first round Australian Open exit. In the Europe/Africa Group I play-off, Baltacha was defeated by Ukrainian Alona Bondarenko.\n\nBaltacha then failed to qualify for two consecutive Tier-I events before losing in the first round of qualifying for the French Open when she lost to Elise Tamaëla. In June, three consecutive wild cards granted her entry into the main draws of the DFS Classic, the Aegon International and Wimbledon where she was beaten by Milagros Sequera in the second round (having beaten Alona Bondarenko in the first), Conchita Martínez in round one and Sabine Klaschka in the first round respectively. Following Wimbledon, Baltacha travelled to the ITF circuit in the United States without much success; she won only one of five matches she played in the run-up to the US Open qualifying draw where she also lost in the first round of qualifying. She then returned to the ITF circuit and reached the quarterfinals of the $25k event in Glasgow, the semifinals of the $25k event in Bolton and won the $25k tournament in Jersey. Her year-end singles ranking for the 2005 season was world number 122.\n\nFor Baltacha, 2006 was a year much shortened by injury. Her first tournament of the year was the qualifying event for the Australian Open where she lost to Yuan Meng at the second stage of qualifying. In February she played one $25k ITF event (where she lost to Melanie South in the first round) and attempted to qualify for three consecutive Tier-II tournaments: Antwerp, Dubai (beaten in final round by Kateryna Bondarenko) and Qatar. This was then followed by two first round losses in $25k tournaments and a run to the semifinals of another. In May she again represented Great Britain in the Fed Cup and again won all three of her singles matches. She beat: Hungarian Kyra Nagy, Bulgaria's Dimana Krastevitch, and Valeria Bondarenko from Ukraine. In the Europe/Africa play-off however, she lost to Slovakia's Magdaléna Rybáriková. After the Fed Cup, Elena played only one more tournament in 2006. This tournament was the French Open where she lost in round one of qualifying to Yevgenia Savransky. She underwent keyhole surgery on a prolapsed disc on 7 June and spent the rest of the season out-of-action recovering and as a result, her season-ending ranking was world number 347.\n\nBy the time Baltacha returned to action in March 2007 after surgery, her singles ranking had fallen to 660 in the world and as such, she had to qualify for her first $25k ITF tournament of the year in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. She qualified before losing to Sorana Cîrstea in the first round. She then competed in two more $25k events in March (reaching the quarterfinals of one) before heading to Bulgaria to compete in the Fed Cup for Britain. She played two singles matches (winning one) and four doubles matches (winning two). Following this, she reached two consecutive $25k semifinals in Incheon and Gimcheon, one as a qualifier and the other as a lucky loser. She consolidated these results with a run to the quarterfinals of another $25k in Changwon. In June she received a wild card into the main draw of the DFS Classic where she showed \"fighting spirit\" in her first round loss to Milagros Sequera. She then received a wild card into the qualifying draw for the Hastings Direct International and proved she deserved it by dropping only nine games in the three matches she won to qualify. She then went on to beat the British number one, Anne Keothavong, in round one of the main draw in a tense three set match and join fellow Britains, Melanie South and Katie O'Brien in the second round, making this the first year since 1991 that three British women reached the second round. She could not quite match up to world number 14, Nicole Vaidišová, in the second round though and was beaten in straight sets. She then received another wild card into the main draw of Wimbledon but wasn't able to overcome the 19th seed, Katarina Srebotnik.\n\nAfter Wimbledon, Baltacha headed to the United States to compete again on the ITF circuit where she reached the quarterfinals of the $50k event in Lexington, Kentucky. After being beaten in the first round of qualifying for the US Open by Evgeniya Rodina, Baltacha headed to Japan to attempt to qualify for the Japan Open. She beat María Emilia Salerni, Ágnes Szatmári and Natalie Grandin to qualify and then continued winning by defeating Yan Zi in the first round. She was defeated by number 5 seed and eventual champion, Virginie Razzano, in round two. This was followed by an unsuccessful attempt to qualify for a Tier-III event in Bangkok and then a return to the ITF circuit where she reached the semifinals in Makinohara and the quarterfinals in Hamanako (both $25k), losing both times to Seiko Okamoto. Her final singles ranking of 2007 was world number 187.\n\nBaltacha began her 2008 season by qualifying for the ASB Classic, beating compatriot, Melanie South, along the way. She faced two-time ASB Classic champion and number 7 seed, Eleni Daniilidou, in the opening round and was beaten. She then progressed to round two of the qualifying tournament for the Australian Open when her first round opponent, Virginie Pichet, retired when down one set. She was beaten in the second round of qualifying by Zhang Shuai. In February, she tried to qualify for Doha (Tier I) and Dubai (Tier II) but was unsuccessful in both. She then returned to action on the ITF circuit and won her next two consecutive tournaments: Jersey ($25k) and Torhout ($75k). In May, she again lost in the first round of the qualifying tournament for the French Open and in June she again received a wild card into the main draw of the DFS Classic where she was beaten in round one by Ekaterina Makarova. Another wild card granted her entry into the qualifying rounds of the International Women's Open where she won her first match against Naomi Cavaday before retiring at one set down in her second match against Tsvetana Pironkova. She then played in the main draw of Wimbledon (again courtesy of a wild card) where she beat Angelique Kerber in the first round. She was defeated in the second round by eventual semifinalist Zheng Jie in straight sets.\n\nBaltacha then lost three consecutive matches before defeating Anna Korzeniak and Carly Gullickson in the first two rounds of qualifying for the US Open. She fell just short of reaching the main draw when she lost to Julie Coin in the final round of qualifying. She played seven more higher-level ITF tournaments over the rest of the year and reached the quarterfinals in one of them: the $50k event in Ismaning where she lost to Julia Görges. Her year-end ranking was world number 136.\n\nBaltacha began 2009 by falling in the first round of qualifying for the ASB Classic before winning three matches to qualify for the Australian Open. She joined compatriots Katie O'Brien (also a qualifier), Anne Keothavong and Melanie South in the main draw; the first time that four British women had competed in the main draw of a Grand Slam other than Wimbledon since the 1992 U.S. Open. Baltacha came up against German, Anna-Lena Grönefeld, in the first round and defeated her comfortably to set up a clash with former world number one, Amélie Mauresmo. Despite surprising many by taking the first set, Baltacha eventually lost in three sets.\n\nFebruary saw Baltacha represent her country in the Fed Cup where she won all three of her singles rubbers in straight sets. In April, Baltacha was the top seed in the $75k ITF tournament in Monzón where she reached the quarterfinals before losing to former world number 4, Kimiko Date-Krumm in a close three-set match. Later that month she reached the final of a $25k where she faced the number 6 seed, Junri Namigata, and won to give her the sixth ITF singles title of her career. In May she reached the semifinals of a $50k in Fukuoka before going on to reach the final round of qualifying for the French Open, where she lost to Yaroslava Shvedova. Between the French Open and Wimbledon, she reached the semifinals of another $50k and reached the second round of the International tournament, the Aegon Classic. She beat Georgie Stoop in the first round before falling in an epic three-set battle with the then world number 27, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. She received a wild card into the main draw of Wimbledon in June where she came up against world number 33, Alona Bondarenko, in the first round. Baltacha managed to come back from a set down to win in three sets. She then went on to lose to Kirsten Flipkens in round two.\n\nThis was followed by three consecutive losses in the first round of qualifying for WTA events before Baltacha won two matches to qualify for the Rogers Cup, a Premier tournament. She faced former world number one, Kim Clijsters, in the second tournament of her comeback and lost to the Belgian in straight sets. Following this, she reached the final round of qualifying for the US Open before going on to win the $75k in Shrewsbury. She beat fellow Brit, Katie O'Brien, in the final. This result was enough to put both finalists into the top 100 for the first time in each of their careers. After this, Baltacha reached the semifinals of one more $50k, the second round of a $100k (where she had to withdraw due to food poisoning) and the quarterfinals of a $75k tournament. These showings helped her accumulate enough points to catapult her back to the British number one spot. Her year-end ranking was world number 87.\n\nBaltacha began her 2010 season by winning three matches to qualify for the ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand. In the first round of the main draw she was beaten by Ioana Raluca Olaru in straight sets. She then went on to win another three matches to qualify for the Hobart International before again losing in the first round, this time to resurgent former world number 4, Jelena Dokić. Her next tournament was the first Grand Slam of the year, the Australian Open. For the first time in her career she was able to gain direct entry into the main draw of the tournament due to her improved ranking. She defeated Pauline Parmentier in the first round. As Baltacha's compatriot, Katie O'Brien, also reached the second round, 2010 marked the first time since 1991 that more than one British woman had reached the second round of the Australian Open. In round two Elena defeated the 30th seed from Ukraine, Kateryna Bondarenko, but she was beaten in the round of 32 by Dinara Safina, the world number 2. In the doubles tournament she partnered Līga Dekmeijere to reach the second round. In February, Baltacha participated in the Fed Cup where the British team was competing in the Europe/Africa Zone. She played two singles matches, losing against Sybille Bammer and defeating Sandra Martinović from the Austria team and the Bosnia and Herzegovina team respectively. She also partnered Sarah Borwell in two doubles matches, winning both.\n\nFollowing this performance in the Fed Cup, Elena competed in a $100k tournament in Midland, Michigan where she reached the final and defeated Lucie Hradecká to win the biggest title of her career. Baltacha then went on to compete in the Cellular South Cup as the eighth seed. She reached the quarterfinals before losing to the top seed and eventual champion, Maria Sharapova. March saw Baltacha qualify for the BNP Paribas Open. After defeating Alexa Glatch in the first round, she faced world number 10, Li Na, in round two and went on to win the match. This gave Elena the first victory of her career over a player ranked in the top 10. Alicia Molik defeated Baltacha in the third round. In her only other tournament during March, Baltacha had to win two matches to qualify for the Sony Ericsson Open before going on to lose to Yanina Wickmayer in the second round of the main tournament. After this, she went on to reach the quarterfinals of a $100k tournament in Johannesberg before beginning her clay court season with a loss to Gréta Arn in the first round of the Italian Open, a Premier-5 event. In her final event before the French Open, Baltacha participated in the Internationaux de Strasbourg as the 8th seed but was forced to retire in the second round due to a back injury. In her first round match at the French Open, she was beaten by Agnieszka Radwańska in straight sets.\n\nHer grass-court season then began and the Aegon Trophy, a $50k event in Nottingham, gave Baltacha the second title of the year. She didn't drop a set throughout the tournament, including in the final when she faced Carly Gullickson. Baltacha stayed on grass for her next tournament, the Aegon Classic, where she was the number 12 seed. She was forced to retire after losing the first set in her first round match against Kaia Kanepi. Her next event was the Aegon International where during her first-round match with Li Na, the Chinese player had to retire with a leg injury after winning the first set on a tie-break. After a second-round win over another Chinese player, Zheng Jie, she lost to Sam Stosur in three sets in the quarterfinals. Nevertheless, this was the first time since 1983 that a British woman had progressed to the quarterfinals of this tournament. Baltacha then suffered a disappointing first round loss at Wimbledon. She lost in three sets to Petra Martić after leading by a set and 5–2.\n\nIn the lead up to the US Open, Baltacha played in the İstanbul Cup, where she reached the quarterfinals. Along the way she defeated world number 8 and reigning French Open champion, Francesca Schiavone, in straight sets, to give her the best win of her career. She was beaten by Andrea Petkovic in the quarterfinals. Baltacha then lost four of her next five matches before participating in the main draw of the US Open for the first time in her career. She managed to exact some revenge by beating Petra Martić in round one however she lost to Petra Kvitová in the second round. Baltacha competed in four more tournaments that year, reaching the second round of the Hansol Korea Open and a $100k in Torhout but losing in the qualifying rounds of the Toray Pan Pacific Open and the Kremlin Cup. She had also been selected to represent Scotland at the Commonwealth Games but chose not to participate due to the poor sanitation in the athletes' village, which, as a result of her chronic liver problem, may have left her susceptible to picking up infections. Her year-end singles ranking was world number 54.\n\nBaltacha began the year at the Hobart International, but lost to Roberta Vinci in the second round. Baltacha then entered the Australian Open without having to qualify. In the first round, she defeated American qualifier Jamie Hampton. In round two, however, she was defeated by former world number 1 and 2004 Australian Open Champion Justine Henin. Her next tournament was the Pattaya Open, where she lost to sixth seed Peng Shuai.\n\nBaltacha lost in the first round of the Dubai Tennis Championships to Alexandra Dulgheru. She then lost in the second round of qualifying at the Qatar Ladies Open to Klára Zakopalová. In the first round of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, Baltacha saved four match points at 2–6, 4–5 in the first round against Roberta Vinci, finally winning in three sets. In the second round she was defeated by 12th seed Flavia Pennetta. In the first round of the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami, Baltacha defeated Sybille Bammer. However, she was defeated in the second round by Klára Zakopalová, the 32nd seed. After direct acceptance into the main draw of the French Open, Baltacha defeated American qualifier Sloane Stephens. Due to the previous win by fellow Briton Heather Watson, it was the first time since 1992 that two British women had cleared the first round of the French Open. In the second round, Baltacha drew another American Vania King, who defeated her in three sets. On 12 June, Baltacha won her first tournament of the season, winning the Aegon Nottingham Challenge without dropping a single set throughout the tournament, defeating Petra Cetkovská in the final.\n\nAn improvement on the previous years disappointment, Baltacha reached the second round of Wimbledon by a victory over Mona Barthel. She failed to progress, however, losing to the 20th seed, Peng Shuai. She went on to enter the qualifying draw of the Cincinnati Open, but despite being seeded 10th, she lost in the first round against Olga Govortsova. She then went on to the inaugural Texas Tennis Open. She managed first and second round wins over Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová and third seed Julia Görges before a quarterfinal loss to Aravane Rezaï.\n\nBaltacha's next tournament was the US Open, where in the first round she walked over American wildcard Jamie Hampton. Hampton had to retire unexpectedly due to cramp and dehydration as she collapsed on the base line. She lost to Svetlana Kuznetsova in the second round. Her final tournament of the year was the Internationaux Féminins de la Vienne, where she got all the way to the final only to lose to Kimiko Date-Krumm in straight sets.\n\nBaltacha began 2012 playing at the ASB Classic. She won her first-round match against wild card and home favourite Sacha Jones in a hard fought three set encounter but lost in the second round in straight sets to Flavia Pennetta. This was followed by a first-round loss in the Australian Open to Stéphanie Foretz Gacon.\n\nBaltacha was selected for the British Fed Cup team to play in the Europe/Africa Group 1 match in Eilat, Israel on 1–4 February 2012. In the group stages she played singles, defeating opponents from Portugal, the Netherlands and Israel. The team qualified for a play-off against Austria in which Baltacha defeated Tamira Paszek. The team won 2–0, which qualified them for a place in the World Group II promotion play-off in April.\n\nAt the French Open, Baltacha faced a tough first round match against US Open champion Sam Stosur on the first match at Court Philippe Chatrier (Centre Court) of the Open. Stosur won without dropping a set. Baltacha did however have a better run at Wimbledon, making the second round but lost to the previous year's champion Petra Kvitová in straight sets. In the first round she had come through a gruelling three setter against Karin Knapp, despite carrying shin splints and picking up an injury during the match. Baltacha competed at the Summer Olympics in London for the first time in her career in both the singles and the doubles events (partnering Anne Keothavong). On 28 July 2012, Baltacha made her Olympics debut with a win against Ágnes Szávay of Hungary, defeating her in straight sets. Baltacha was then defeated by 11th seed Ana Ivanovic in the second round in a very tight encounter. This was Baltacha's last professional match of 2012, taking time off to undergo foot surgery.\n\nBaltacha's first tournament back after surgery was a $25k tournament in Pelham, Alabama, where she was a direct entrant into the main draw. She withdrew against Canada's Sharon Fichman in round one.\n\nAn illness to Heather Watson meant that Baltacha made British Fed Cup World Group II play-off team to face Argentina. Baltacha replaced Johanna Konta to play one of the singles rubbers on the final day of the play-off. Laura Robson's defeat in the third rubber meant that Baltacha had to gain a victory over María Irigoyen. Baltacha lost in three sets, meaning that Great Britain would have to return to the Europe/Africa Group and attempt to qualify again next February.\n\nBaltacha was handed a wild card at the Brussels Open a week before Roland Garros. In the first round she surprisingly defeated Stefanie Vögele but lost to the seventh seeded Varvara Lepchenko in straight sets. At the French Open Baltacha used her protected rankings points to earn a place in the first round. She was beaten in straight sets by Marina Erakovic. Following this defeat, Baltacha was handed a wildcard to play at the Aegon Trophy, an ITF event in Nottingham, but again lost in the first round to sixth seed Vesna Dolonc.\n\nBaltacha reached her first final of 2013 at the Aegon Nottingham Challenge following an impressive straight-set victory over Italian Nastassja Burnett in the semifinals. She then beat the seventh seed Tadeja Majerič in the final in straight sets coming from behind in the first 2–5 down to claim her third title at Nottingham. Baltacha followed this success with a victory in the first round of the Aegon Classic against Czech qualifier Kristýna Plíšková. Baltacha was eliminated in the second round by Maria Kirilenko.\n\nBaltacha retired from professional tennis in November 2013.\n\n"}

It is one of the four isomers of butanol. \"tert\"-Butyl alcohol is a colorless solid, which melts near room temperature and has a camphor-like odor. It is miscible with water, ethanol and diethyl ether.\n\n\"tert\"-Butyl alcohol has been identified in beer and chickpeas. It is also found in cassava, which is used as a fermentation ingredient in certain alcoholic beverages.\n\n\"tert\"-Butyl alcohol is derived commercially from isobutane as a coproduct of propylene oxide production. It can also be produced by the catalytic hydration of isobutylene, or by a Grignard reaction between acetone and methylmagnesium chloride.\n\nPurification cannot be performed by simple distillation due to formation of an azeotrope with water, although initial drying of the solvent containing large amounts of water is performed by adding benzene to form a tertiary azeotrope and distilling off the water. Smaller amounts of water are removed by drying with calcium oxide (CaO), potassium carbonate (KCO), calcium sulfate (CaSO), or magnesium sulfate (MgSO), followed by fractional distillation. Anhydrous \"tert\"-butyl alcohol is obtained by further refluxing and distilling from magnesium activated with iodine, or alkali metals such as sodium or potassium. Other methods include the use of 4 Å molecular sieves, aluminium \"tert\"-butylate, calcium hydride (CaH), or fractional crystallization under inert atmosphere.\n\n\"tert\"-Butyl alcohol is used as a solvent, ethanol denaturant, paint remover ingredient, and gasoline octane booster and oxygenate. It is a chemical intermediate used to produce methyl \"tert\"-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl \"tert\"-butyl ether (ETBE) by reaction with methanol and ethanol, respectively, and \"tert\"-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) by reaction with hydrogen peroxide.\n\nAs a tertiary alcohol, \"tert\"-butyl alcohol is more resistant to oxidation than the other isomers of butanol.\n\n\"tert\"-Butyl alcohol is deprotonated with a strong base to give the alkoxide. Particular common is potassium \"tert\"-butoxide, which is prepared by treating \"tert\"-butanol with potassium metal.\nThe \"tert\"-butoxide is a strong, non-nucleophilic base in organic chemistry. It readily abstracts acidic protons from substrates, but its steric bulk inhibits the group from participating in nucleophilic substitution, such as in a Williamson ether synthesis or an S2 reaction.\n\n\"tert\"-Butyl alcohol reacts with hydrogen chloride to form \"tert\"-butyl chloride.\n\nO-Chlorination of tert-butyl alcohol with hypochlorous acid to give tert-butyl hypochlorite:\n\nThere is limited data on the pharmacology and toxicology of tert-butanol in humans and other animals. Human exposure may occur due to fuel oxygenate metabolism. Tert-butanol is poorly absorbed through skin but rapidly absorbed if inhaled or ingested. Tert-butanol is irritating to skin or eyes. Toxicity of single doses is usually low but high doses can produce a sedative or anesthetic effect.\n\n"}

The first version, titled Harvard Presentation Graphics was released for MS-DOS in 1986 by Software Publishing Corporation (SPC) and achieved a high market share. It was taken off the market in 2017.\n\nHarvard Graphics was one of the first desktop business application software programs that allowed users to incorporate text, information graphics, and charts into custom slideshow presentations. The original version could import data from Lotus 1-2-3 or Lotus Symphony, charts created in Symphony or PFS Graph, and ASCII text. It could export text and graphics to Computer Graphics Metafile and to , also manufactured by SPC. Its use of vector graphics produced mixed results on the CGA and EGA displays common at the time, but output was usually sent to a slide printer or a color plotter.\n\n\"Presentation\" was dropped from the name for the second release, which came in 1987, developed by Mario Chaves, Carl Hu, Lenore Kirvay, and Dana Tom. Harvard Graphics 2.0 added the ability to import the latest Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet data before generating graphics, as well as drawing and annotations for graphs. Version 3.0 was not released until 1991, offering improved editing functions, but its graphics and export capabilities were being outperformed by competitors like Aldus Persuasion and Lotus Freelance.\n\nHarvard Graphics was used as bonus product with Windows 95 by Australian Retailer Harvey Norman.\n\nThe market leader through the late 1980s, Harvard Graphics struggled as the market shifted to Microsoft Windows.

{"id": "2006103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006103", "title": "APS-C", "text": "APS-C\n\nAdvanced Photo System type-C (APS-C) is an image sensor format approximately equivalent in size to the Advanced Photo System film negative in its C (\"Classic\") format, of 25.1×16.7 mm, an aspect ratio of 3:2. It is therefore also equivalent in size to the Super 35 motion picture film format, which has the dimensions of 24.89 mm × 18.66 mm (0.980 in × 0.735 in).\n\nSensors approximating these dimensions are used in many digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs), mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras (MILCs), and a few large-sensor live-preview digital cameras. APS-C size sensors are also used in a few digital rangefinders.\n\nSuch sensors exist in many different variants depending on the manufacturer and camera model. \nAll APS-C variants are considerably smaller than 35 mm standard film which measures 36×24 mm. Because of this, devices with APS-C sensors are known as \"cropped frame,\" especially when used in connection with lens mounts that are also used with sensors the size of 35 mm film: only part of the image produced by the lens is captured by the APS-C size sensor. Sensor sizes range from 20.7×13.8 mm to 28.7×19.1 mm, but are typically about 22.5×15 mm for Canon and 24×16 mm for other manufacturers. Each variant results in a slightly different angle of view from lenses at the same focal length and overall a much narrower angle of view compared to 35 mm film. This is why each manufacturer offers a range of lenses designed for its format.\n\nThe signal-to-noise ratio for a given pixel is largely defined by the number of photons per pixel and the sensor readout noise. Hence, for practical applications, the image noise of an APS-C sensor cannot be directly compared to either smaller or bigger sensor sizes, as its light-collecting property is largely defined by the overall optical system, rather than sensor area.\n\nMost DSLR and third party lens manufacturers now make lenses specifically designed for APS-C cameras. The designations by brand include:\n\nA crop factor (sometimes referred to as a \"focal length multiplier\" for comparing a proportionally scaled lens/image circle projection/sensor diameter) can be used to calculate the field of view in 35 mm terms from the actual focal length. The most common multiplier ratios:\n\nCanon, Fuji, Nikon, Pentax and Sony have developed and designed lenses specifically for their cameras with a lens factor (more fully, lens focal length conversion factor) or \"crop factor\". Whilst Canon uses a factor of 1.6×, the other four brands all use 1.5×. APS-C cameras use a smaller area to form the image than traditional 35 mm cameras, and so lenses used on APS-C format cameras have a correspondingly narrower field of view. For example, a 28 mm lens is a wide angle lens on a traditional 35 mm camera. But the same lens on an APS-C camera, with a lens factor of 1.6× (relative to a standard full-frame 35 mm format camera), has the same angle of view as a 45 mm (28 mm × 1.6 lens factor) lens on a 35 mm camera—i.e. a normal lens. Several third-party lens manufacturers, such as Tamron, Tokina, and Sigma, also manufacture a range of lenses optimised for APS-C sensors.\n\n\nCanon introduced the Canon EF-S line of lenses in 2003 alongside the 300D. These lenses place the rear of the lens closer to the camera's sensor (referred to as short back focus). This has several benefits, including lighter lenses and a narrower field of view (which implies \"longer\" zoom). EF-S lenses are compatible with Canon's APS-C digital SLRs, with the exception of the early Canon EOS D30, Canon EOS D60, and Canon EOS 10D, which predated the introduction of the mounting system. EF-S lenses will not physically mount on Canon's full-frame digital or 35mm film SLRs. More recently, the company introduced the EF-M line for its EOS M series of mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras (MILCs). EF-M lenses will not physically mount on any Canon SLR, whether film or digital. The rear of an EF-M lens is considerably closer to the sensor or film plane than that of an EF (full-frame/35mm) or EF-S lens, making it necessary to ensure that the EF-M lens will not mount on the other bodies. Canon sells an optional adapter that allows EF-M bodies to accept all EF and EF-S lenses.\n\nNikon makes DX format lenses for their line of APS-C digital cameras. These can be physically mounted to all Nikon digital and film SLR camera bodies since 1977. These lenses generally exhibit vignetting at shorter focal lengths when mounted on Nikon film bodies, but are typically usable at longer focal lengths. When mounted on a Nikon FX (full-frame) digital body, by default the camera will automatically adjust the viewfinder to depict the DX frame area and crop the captured images to the DX image size. This can be overridden by the user if desired.\n\nPentax produces the DA line for their APS-C cameras. These lenses are available in focal lengths that offer similar field-of-view as lenses previously available for 135 film. The trademark compact design of the DA limited series takes advantage of the smaller APS-C format with the lenses under 40 mm and is fully usable on 135 Film with the DA Limited Lenses over 35 mm focal length. All DA lenses can be mounted on Pentax film bodies, albeit with increased vignetting. All fixed focal lengths in the rugged DA* series cover 35 film format fully.\n\nSony has two lines specifically designed for their APS-C cameras—the DT line for their A-mount DSLRs and α SLTs, and the E-mount for their α MILCs. The DT lenses can be mounted on any Sony A-mount camera, but are specifically designed for the DSLR-A100 up to DSLR-A700 series of APS-C-format DSLRs, the earlier Konica Minolta 5D and 7D, and the most recent APS-C Alpha SLTs. DT lenses can be mounted on full-frame models like the DSLR-A850, DSLR-A900, and SLT-A99 in \"crop\" mode, where the frame is cropped and the resolution is roughly halved. E-mount lenses are compatible with all of the company's APS-C MILCs, from the NEX-3 and NEX-5 through the current α3000, α5100, and α6500. In addition, they can be mounted on Sony full-frame MILCs (α7/α7R/α7S, α7R II, α7S II) in \"crop\" mode (the company also produces E-mount lenses designated as \"FE\", which cover the entire full-frame image circle).\n\n\n"}

The King Comics \"Flash Gordon\" title was well-received, winning three Alley Awards in 1966 and another in 1967. The series had distribution problems throughout its run. Several distributors refused to take the King Comics because their first issues lacked a Comics Code Authority seal; King subsequently obtained a CCA seal on all later King Comics issues. King Features tried to overcome the distribution problem by selling its titles in special \"King Paks\" of three to variety stores and supermarkets.

Brown Stadium is a baseball stadium in the United States located in Battle Creek, Michigan. The stadium was built in 1990 and is a part of Bailey Park, a longtime home of amateur baseball. C.O. Brown Stadium is the former home of the Michigan Battle Cats, Battle Creek Yankees and the Southwest Michigan Devil Rays of the Class A Midwest League. The stadium has a seating capacity of 2,193. C.O. Brown Stadium is the current home of the Northwoods League's Battle Creek Bombers.\n\nThe stadium was named for Cooper Othniel Brown, a baseball entrepreneur who helped make Battle Creek a hub for amateur tournament baseball in the 1930s and served as the first president of the American Amateur Baseball Congress.\n\nOn August 31, 2008, shortly after accepting the democratic nomination, Barack Obama and Joe Biden held a rally at C.O. Brown Stadium drawing an estimated 15,000 people.\n\nIt has also hosted postseason baseball tournaments. Until 2013, the MHSAA used the stadium to host the Michigan Baseball State Championships for all four divisions where they have been moved to Drayton McLane Baseball Stadium at John H. Kobs Field in 2014. The stadium also hosted the 1993 and 1994 Big Ten Conference Baseball Tournaments.\n\nIn 2016 the team announced major ballpark renovations that will drop the seating capacity of C.O. Brown Stadium from more than 4,000 to 2,300. The marquee renovation includes the introduction of an all-new “Home Plate Club,” which will feature 10 granite half-moon tables situated directly behind home plate. Each table will also feature four stadium chairs sourced from Camden Yards. Each table will have access to its own all-inclusive upscale menu, including both beer and wine pairings. The team has already had a number of these reserved and is taking deposits for full- and half-season plans immediately. All 10 tables are expected to be sold out well before Opening Day.\n\n“The Champions Club,” which was sold out for most of 2015, now shifts down the first and third base lines. These areas will now feature additional legroom and a food and beverage railing in front of each seat. This renovation allows for a more comfortable fan experience and gives the Bombers 98 Champions Club seats for 2016.\n\nThe bleacher area will also look quite different this summer. The team will offer reserved bleacher seats instead of general admission seating, which will guarantee ticket holders a designated seat at each game. The first-base side will now have permanent vinyl grandstand covers over the seats. These covers will eliminate seating in an area where historically the sun has tormented fans.\n\nThe Miller Lite Party Deck will also be receiving a facelift, courtesy of Heights Construction. While some general upkeep and maintenance will be performed, the team plans to stain the deck area while repurposing seats from the original C.O. Brown Stadium bowl grandstand. Furthermore, the team has now limited the Miller Lite Party Deck to approximately 375 tickets on any given night and will allow groups to reserve their own private sections.\n\nIn November 2007, Bailey Park and C.O. Brown Stadium was awarded the 2007 USSSA United States Specialty Sports Association Complex of the Year Award presented at the USSSA National Meeting in Daytona Beach, Florida.\n\nPresented annually to one facility in the country, there are a number of requirements that a complex must meet to qualify. Requirements for the award include: full participation with USSSA, a proven history of hosting and running quality events, a high number of participating teams, outstanding facilities, and top notch ground crews.\n\n"}

A German appearance occurred in 1992.\n\nThe specific visual form and common use of the term \"tag cloud\" rose to prominence in the first decade of the 21st century as a widespread feature of early Web 2.0 websites and blogs, used primarily to visualize the frequency distribution of keyword metadata that describe website content, and as a navigation aid.\n\nThe first tag clouds on a high-profile website were on the photo sharing site Flickr, created by Flickr co-founder and interaction designer Stewart Butterfield in 2004. That implementation was based on Jim Flanagan's Search Referral Zeitgeist, a visualization of Web site referrers. Tag clouds were also popularized around the same time by Del.icio.us and Technorati, among others.\n\nOversaturation of the tag cloud method and ambivalence about its utility as a web-navigation tool led to a noted decline of usage among these early adopters. (Flickr would later \"apologize\" to the web-development community in their five-word acceptance speech for the 2006 \"Best Practices\" Webby Award, where they simply stated \"sorry about the tag clouds.\")\n\nA second generation of software development discovered a wider diversity of uses for tag clouds as a basic visualization method for text data. Several extensions of tag clouds have been proposed in this context. Examples include Parallel Tag Clouds, SparkClouds, and Prefix Tag Clouds. The Word Cloud Explorer, written in Adobe Flex, combines tag clouds with a number of interactive features for text analysis.\n\nThere are three main types of tag cloud applications in social software, distinguished by their meaning rather than appearance. In the first type, there is a tag for the frequency of each item, whereas in the second type, there are global tag clouds where the frequencies are aggregated over all items and users. In the third type, the cloud contains categories, with size indicating number of subcategories.\n\nIn the first type, size represents the number of times that tag has been applied to a single item. This is useful as a means of displaying metadata about an item that has been democratically \"voted\" on and where precise results are not desired.\n\nIn the second, more commonly used type, size represents the number of items to which a tag has been applied, as a presentation of each tag's popularity.\n\nInstead of frequency, the size can be used to represent the significance of words and word co-occurrences, compared to a background corpus (for example, compared to all the text in Wikipedia). This approach cannot be used standalone, but it relies on comparing the document frequencies to expected distributions.\n\nIn the third type, tags are used as a categorization method for content items. Tags are represented in a cloud where larger tags represent the quantity of content items in that category.\n\nThere are some approaches to construct tag clusters instead of tag clouds, e.g., by applying tag co-occurrences in documents.\n\nMore generally, the same visual technique can be used to display non-tag data, as in a word cloud or a data cloud.\n\nThe term keyword cloud is sometimes used as a search engine marketing (SEM) term that refers to a group of keywords that are relevant to a specific website. In recent years tag clouds have gained popularity because of their role in search engine optimization of Web pages as well as supporting the user in navigating the content in an information system efficiently. Tag clouds as a navigational tool make the resources of a website more connected, when crawled by a search engine spider, which may improve the site's search engine rank. From a user interface perspective they are often used to summarize search results to support the user in finding content in a particular information system more quickly.\n\nTag clouds are typically represented using inline HTML elements. The tags can appear in alphabetical order, in a random order, they can be sorted by weight, and so on. Sometimes, further visual properties are manipulated in addition to font size, such as the font color, intensity, or weight. Most popular is a rectangular tag arrangement with alphabetical sorting in a sequential line-by-line layout. The decision for an optimal layout should be driven by the expected user goals. Some prefer to cluster the tags semantically so that similar tags will appear near each other or use embedding techniques such as tSNE to position words. Edges can be added to emphasize the co-occurrences of tags and visualize interactions. Heuristics can be used to reduce the size of the tag cloud whether or not the purpose is to cluster the tags.\n\nTag cloud visual taxonomy is determined by a number of attributes: tag ordering rule (e.g. alphabetically, by importance, by context, randomly, ordered for visual quality), shape of the entire cloud (e.g. rectangular, circle, given map borders), shape of tag bounds (rectangle, or character body), tag rotation (none, free, limited), vertical tag alignment (sticking to typographical baselines, free). A tag cloud on the web must address problems of modeling and controlling aesthetics, constructing a two-dimensional layout of tags, and all these must be done in short time on volatile browser platform. Tags clouds to be used on the web must be in HTML, not graphics, to make them robot-readable, they must be constructed on the client side using the fonts available in the browser, and they must fit in a rectangular box.\n\nA data cloud or cloud data is a data display which uses font size and/or color to indicate numerical values. It is similar to a tag cloud but instead of word count, displays data such as population or stock market prices.\n\nA text cloud or word cloud is a visualization of word frequency in a given text as a weighted list. The technique has recently been popularly used to visualize the topical content of political speeches.\n\nExtending the principles of a text cloud, a collocate cloud provides a more focused view of a document or corpus. Instead of summarising an entire document, the collocate cloud examines the usage of a particular word. The resulting cloud contains the words which are often used in conjunction with the search word. These collocates are formatted to show frequency (as size) as well as collocational strength (as brightness). This provides interactive ways to browse and explore language.\n\nTag clouds have been subject of investigation in several usability studies. The following summary is based on an overview of research results given by Lohmann et al.:\n\nFelix et al. compared how human reading performance differs from traditional tag clouds that map numeric values to the size of the font and alternative designs that uses for example color or additional shapes like circle and bars. They also compared how different arrangement of the words affects performance.\n\nIn principle, the font size of a tag in a tag cloud is determined by its incidence. For a word cloud of categories like weblogs, frequency, for example, corresponds to the number of weblog entries that are assigned to a category. For smaller frequencies one can specify font sizes directly, from one to whatever the maximum font size. For larger values, a scaling should be made. In a linear normalization, the weight formula_1 of a descriptor is mapped to a size scale of 1 through \"f\", where formula_2 and formula_3 are specifying the range of available weights.\n\nSince the number of indexed items per descriptor is usually distributed according to a power law, for larger ranges of values, a logarithmic representation makes sense.\n\nImplementations of tag clouds also include text parsing and filtering out unhelpful tags such as common words, numbers, and punctuation.\n\nThere are also websites creating artificially or randomly weighted tag clouds, for advertising, or for humorous results.\n\n"}

As a nationalist leader and Prime Minister, he helped to restore civilian government to the country following military rule.\n\nBusia was born a prince in the kingdom of Wenchi, in the Brong Ahafo Region, one of the four Gold Coast Territories, then under British rule and now called Ghana.\n\nHe was educated at Methodist School, Wenchi, Mfantsipim School, Cape Coast, then at Wesley College, Kumasi, from 1931 to 1932. He later became a teacher at Achimota School and Wesley College. He gained his first degree with Honours in Medieval and Modern History from the University of London, through correspondence during this period. He then went on to study at University College, Oxford, where he was the college's first African student. He returned to the Gold Coast in 1942. He took a BA (Hons) in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (1941, MA 1946) and a DPhil in Social Anthropology in 1947 at Nuffield College, Oxford, with a thesis entitled \"The position of the chief in the modern political system of Ashanti: a study of the influence of contemporary social changes on Ashanti political institutions.\"\n\nHe served as a district commissioner from 1942 to 1949, and was appointed first lecturer in African Studies. He became the first African to occupy a Chair at the University College of the Gold Coast (now the University of Ghana). In 1951 he was elected by the Ashanti Confederacy to the Legislative Council. In 1952, he was Leader of Ghana Congress Party, which later merged with the other opposition parties to form the United Party (UP).\n\nAs leader of the opposition against Kwame Nkrumah, he fled the country on the grounds that his life was under threat. In 1959 Busia became a Professor of Sociology and Culture of Africa at the University of Leiden near the Hague, Netherlands. From 1962 until 1969, he was a Fellow of St Antony's College, Oxford.\n\nHe returned to Ghana in March 1966 after Nkrumah's government was overthrown by the military to serve on the National Liberation Council of General Joseph Ankrah, the military head of state; and was appointed as the Chairman of the National Advisory Committee of the NLC. In 1967/68, he served as the Chairman of the Centre for Civic Education. He used this opportunity to promote himself as the next Leader. He also was a Member of the Constitutional Review Committee. When the NLC lifted the ban on politics, Busia, together with friends in the defunct UP formed the Progress Party (PP).\n\nIn 1969, the PP won the parliamentary elections with 104 of the 105 seats contested. This paved the way for him to become the next Prime Minister. Busia continued with NLC's anti-Nkrumaist stance and adopted a liberalised economic system. There was a mass deportation of half a million Nigerian citizens from Ghana, and a 44 percent devaluation of the cedi in 1971, which met with a lot of resistance from the public.\n\nWhile he was in Britain for a medical check-up, the army under Colonel Ignatius Kutu Acheampong overthrew his government on 13 January 1972. Busia remained in exile in England and returned to Oxford University, where he died from a heart attack in August 1978.\n\nAlong with J. B. Danquah and S. D. Dombo, Busia's name is associated with Ghana's political right. The New Patriotic Party has claimed the Danquah-Busia-Dombo mantle in the Fourth Republic.\n\nHe left behind four sons and four daughters: Kwasi Osei, Afua Safoa, Nana Gyasi, Yaw, author Abena, yoga guru Kofi, Nana Frema, and actress Akosua Busia.\n\n\n"}

He played for Brynäs IF, the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Detroit Red Wings, and AIK. Salming was one of the first European players to make an impact in the National Hockey League (NHL), paving the way for future generations of players. He was one of the premier defencemen of his era in the NHL, and was recognized for this by being inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1996. Remembered for his many seasons with the Maple Leafs, he holds numerous franchise records, including most assists. Salming also played extensively for Sweden in international play. He was recognized for this by being selected to the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) Centennial All-Star Team. In 2017 Salming was named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history.\n\nSalming was born on 17 April 1951 in the village of Salmi in Kiruna, near Torneträsk in Jukkasjärvi Parish. His father, Erland, was of Sami origin, while his mother, Karin, is Swedish. His paternal grandfather Anders Nikolaus had the surname of \"Saari\", but changed to \"Salming\" after the village that he and his father (Börje's great-grandfather) had built up. His father was a mineworker and died in an accident in the mine when Salming was 5 years old. He is proud of his Sami heritage, and wears a traditional Sami pewter bracelet. He is the first person of Sami origin to play in a top North American professional sports league.\n\nHe followed in his older brother Stig Salming's footsteps playing ice hockey and also played handball.\n\nSalming played with Kiruna AIF in Sweden's Division 2 from 1967–1970, before joining Brynäs in the top division between 1970 and 1973. Brynäs won league championships in 1971 and 1972 with Salming on the squad. Salming was signed as a free agent by the Toronto Maple Leafs on 12 May 1973. Salming was not the Leafs target when they began scouting in Sweden; they were actually interested in Inge Hammarström, but scout Gerry McNamara reported back positively on Salming after seeing him play.\n\nSalming made his National Hockey League (NHL) debut with the Leafs at the beginning of the 1973–74 NHL season against the Buffalo Sabres. After a 7–4 victory, Salming was named the best player of the game. At the end of the season, Salming had recorded 39 points.\n\nPrior to Börje Salming's breakthrough, the consensus in North American ice hockey circles was that European players in general lacked the toughness to play NHL ice hockey, with those from Sweden even being referred to as \"Chicken Swedes\". However, Salming did much to permanently eradicate that reputation. He played in 1148 regular season games (1099 of them with the Leafs), 81 playoff games and scored 150 goals and 637 assists in the NHL.\n\nSalming was named a First Team All-Star in 1977, and was selected to the Second Team in 1975, 1976, 1978, 1979 and 1980. Salming spent 16 seasons with the Maple Leafs, recording 768 points (148 goals, 620 assists).\n\nOn 4 September 1986, Salming was suspended by the NHL for the entire 1986–87 season for admitting in a newspaper interview that he had tried cocaine. However, Salming served just eight games of the suspension before being reinstated. On 26 November 1986, late in a game between the Leafs and the Red Wings in Detroit, Salming was knocked down in front of the Leafs net and Gerard Gallant of the Red Wings accidentally cut Salming's face with his skate blade. The injury required facial surgery and more than two hundred stitches to his face.\n\nIn 1989, after sixteen years with the Toronto Maple Leafs, he signed as a free agent with the Red Wings, for whom he played one season to finish his career in the NHL. He completed his pro hockey career with AIK of the Swedish Elite League.\n\nSalming was a fan favourite in Toronto. The peak of his popularity may have come during the 1976 Canada Cup which was held at Maple Leaf Gardens. When Team Sweden was playing against the Team USA, Salming received an extended standing ovation during player introductions. Salming later commented, \"I'll never forget our game in Toronto. The fans gave me a standing ovation during the introductions. I was representing my country and Canadian fans gave me a standing ovation. Sometimes hockey has no country.\"\n\nAfter the end of his active hockey career, Salming moved into the sports underwear business with his own brand \"Salming Underwear\". In 2007, at age 56, he posed nude for acclaimed Swedish graffiti artist Johan A Wattberg to create 31 paintings that were initially exhibited in Sweden before going on permanent display at The SPORT Gallery in Toronto, Canada.\n\nIn 1996, he became the first Swedish hockey player to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1998, he was ranked 74th on \"The Hockey News\"' list of the 100 Greatest National Hockey League Players, the highest-ranked player from Sweden.\n\nOn 4 October 2006, Salming's no. 21, along with Red Kelly's and Hap Day's no. 4, was honoured by the Leafs in a ceremony before their first game of the 2006–07 season.\n\n"}

Due to its complexity, it is often very hard to read by people who are not familiar with it. Usually, this form of graffiti incorporates interwoven and overlapping letters and shapes. It may include arrows, spikes, and other decorative elements depending on the technique used. The numerous layers and shapes make this style extremely difficult to produce homogeneously, which is why developing an original style in this field is seen as one of the greatest artistic challenges to a graffiti writer. Wildstyle pieces are the most complex form of piece (\"masterpiece\") lettering, a stage higher than the quick simplified stylised letters known as \"burners\". Wildstyle is seen as one of the most complicated and difficult masterpiece styles and refers to larger complex letters which have volume as opposed to mere signatures or graffiti art \"tags\".\n\nWildstyle commonly includes a set of arrows, curves and letters which have been so transformed as to be rendered arcane to the eyes of non-graffiti artists. It has also been common practice to incorporate 3D elements into the pieces. Letter structures are therefore rendered to add depth of visual perception of the work. Many artists have different elements to add to their wildstyle that gain that writer a good deal of respect within the graffiti scene, especially if one creates his or her own style and stays original and creative. Veteran artists tend to go for more complicated forms of wildstyle in which the types are hard to read but broad in creativity. Getting one's style mastered is key to achieving this success.\n\nThe term \"wildstyle\" was popularized by the Wild Style graffiti crew formed by Tracy 168 of the Bronx. Formerly a street gang with over 500 members, the Bronx-based Wild Style crew is still active. Members include the founder Tracy 168, Cope2, T-Kid 170, Lava I&II, Taki 183, Daze, Comet, Blade, Futura 200, Dan Plasma, Jimmy Ha-Ha and Yip. Complex and elaborate graffiti writing had been called numerous terms such as \"mechanical letters.\" It was founded by Rif, Phase II and Stan 153. Kase II later introduced \"computer-rock\". The stylistic approach advanced at the same time Wild Style crew grew large and spread throughout New York City. So many members executed the complex style that eventually the crew's name was associated with the complex style.\n\n"}

It was released on August 24, 1979 as the lead single from his second album, \"Prince\". The song was Prince's first major hit single in the United States, reaching number 11 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on January 26, 1980, holding the number 11 position for two weeks, and peaking at number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot Soul Singles chart for two weeks.\n\n\"I Wanna Be Your Lover\" was written after Warner Bros. requested a follow-up to Prince's debut album \"For You\", which had underperformed commercially. In response, Prince recorded \"I Wanna Be Your Lover.\" Musically, it is a funk song sung exclusively in falsetto, detailing Prince's love for a woman and how he would treat her better than the men she is with, and frustration that she thinks of him as \"a child\". The single edit stops after 2:57, but the album version goes off on a jam of keyboards and synthesizers, including a Polymoog, played by Prince. It was later revealed that the song concerned a crush Prince had at the time on pianist and singer Patrice Rushen.\n\nPrince promoted the song by lip-syncing it with his band on \"The Midnight Special\" and \"American Bandstand\", where he gave host Dick Clark an awkward interview, answering his questions with one-word answers. Prince claimed to be 19 but was 21 at the time. Clark later said, \"That was one of the most difficult interviews I've ever conducted, and I've done 10,000 musician interviews.\"\n\nThe song was also Prince's debut single released in the UK; it was not a hit, only reaching No. 41 on the UK Singles Chart and when Prince tried to promote it with shows in London, he was forced to cancel due to poor attendance. It would not be until \"Purple Rain\" (1984) that Prince would break big in Europe.\n\nThe song additionally reached No. 2 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart and No. 2 in New Zealand.\n\nPrince included a sample of this song in the opening of his 1992 hit single \"My Name Is Prince\".\n\nThere are two versions of the music video of the hit single. The main version has Prince in an unbuttoned leopard shirt and jeans singing alone in a black background with only a mic, notably with straight/wavy hair and a departure from his afro from a year before. Various shots show him playing the instruments by himself.\n\nThe other version, which has not aired and was not featured on The Hits Collection compilation shows Prince and his band members performing the song in a painted room. The video was pulled due to skimpy clothing and a sexually suggestive theme (Prince was clad in blue stockings and a tan shirt, and frequently throughout the performance kisses his female keyboardist).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The system also was given the NATO reporting name SS-X-10 Scrag, and carried a Soviet GRAU index of 8K713.\n\nIn 1961, faced with the prospect of development in the United States of an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system to intercept conventional ICBMs, the Soviet Union began development of a fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS) to defeat these interceptors. Soviet Chief Designer, Sergei Pavlovich Korolev designed the Global Rocket 1 (GR-1). The concept was to construct a missile that could be launched into low earth orbit (150 km), from which a 1500 kg nuclear warhead equipped with a deorbit stage could be dropped to its targets in a non-ballistic manner and without giving away its target until final descent. This concept would allow for very little warning to the U.S. because the rocket would be able to approach the United States from any direction and avoid missile tracking radar by flying below its coverage. Not only could such a missile hit any point on earth, but the enemy would also be uncertain when it would be deorbited onto target. The main disadvantage was lower accuracy of the warhead in comparison to an ICBM. Korolev insisted on sticking to the liquid oxygen/kerosene propellants of his R-9 Desna ICBM design, despite the military's preference for the more toxic but storable propellants used by other designers. The GR-1 was intended to utilize the launch pads of Korolev's R-9 Desna which was being phased out of service.\n\nKorolev unofficially started work on the missile on 15 March 1962 based on a verbal go-ahead by Khrushchev. The draft project for the GR-1 was completed in May 1962, and a mock-up had already been built and drawings released to the production shop by the time the official resolution was issued on 24 September 1962. Test flights were scheduled to start in the third quarter of 1963. Further development of the GR-1 missile was halted in 1964 in preference of the orbital R-36 missile.\n\nThe GR-1 project was cancelled in 1964 citing engine delays, a fate which became permanent for all of the FOBS designs after the SALT II agreement of 1979. Even earlier, in 1972, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty removed the primary reason for such a weapon.\n\n\n"}

He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961. In 2017 Schmidt was named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history.\n\nSchmidt's early years were spent in Kitchener, where he attended King Edward Public School. In high school, he briefly attended Kitchener-Waterloo Collegiate and Vocational School, but dropped out at age 14 in order to work to support his family (his father had become too ill to work regularly), and took a job at a shoe factory. He made 18 cents per hour ($ per hour in dollars) while working there and claimed that he knew the value of the dollar. He continued playing junior hockey with the Kitchener Empires and Kitchener Greenshirts. Schmidt was a childhood friend of fellow Hall of Famers Woody Dumart and Bobby Bauer. At the age of 20, while playing for the Boston Bruins' AHL farm team, the Providence Reds, Schmidt was invited to try out for the St. Louis Cardinals pro baseball team, but knew himself well enough from his youth baseball experience that while he could hit the ball out of the park, he would strike out many more times than hitting home runs.\n\nSchmidt played junior hockey with Dumart and Bauer in Kitchener, Ontario before their rights were all acquired by the Bruins in 1935. After playing a final year of junior hockey in Kitchener, Ontario, and half a year with the Providence Reds, Schmidt was called up to the Bruins during the 1937 season. He quickly proved himself to be a hardnosed centre, a skilled stickhandler and smooth playmaker.\n\nSchmidt and his childhood friends Bauer and Dumart were teamed up together in the NHL as well. They formed the Kraut Line, and were a strong and dependable line for the Bruins for most of the following fifteen seasons. They were a key ingredient to the Bruins' success as they rampaged to the regular season title and a hard-fought Stanley Cup victory in 1939. The following season Schmidt became a star, as he led the league in scoring and guided the Bruins to another first-place finish and the third-most goals in team history to date.\n\nThe 1941 season saw Schmidt spearhead the Bruins to their second Cup win in three years. However, the powerhouse Brown and Gold were decimated by World War II the following year as Schmidt, Bauer and Dumart enlisted in the Canadian military and superstar American goaltender Frank Brimsek enlisted with the United States Coast Guard. The Kraut Line found success playing hockey for the Ottawa RCAF team by winning the Allan Cup before heading overseas. Schmidt, Bauer and Dumart ultimately missed three productive NHL seasons due to their service in the War.\n\nSchmidt returned for the beginning of the 1946 season. He resumed his starring ways and finished fourth in league scoring in 1947. Named captain in 1951, Schmidt won the Hart Trophy as the league's most valuable player that year. He retired as a player partway through the 1954–1955 season to take over head coaching duties, replacing Lynn Patrick.\n\nSchmidt coached the Bruins up to the 1966 season with a year and a half hiatus. He also was Boston's assistant general manager. After coaching the Bruins for 11 seasons Schmidt was promoted to the general manager position in 1967 just as the league ushered in six new franchises, doubling in size. Schmidt proved to be a great architect in the new era of the NHL, acquiring and drafting several key players to build a Bruins team that won two more Stanley Cups in 1970 and 1972. His biggest deal was a blockbuster as he acquired Phil Esposito, Ken Hodge and Fred Stanfield from the Chicago Black Hawks in exchange for Pit Martin, Gilles Marotte and Jack Norris.\n\nAfter his long and loyal career in the Bruins organization, Schmidt left the team to become the first General Manager of the expansion Washington Capitals for the start of the 1975 season. Unfortunately for Schmidt, the Capitals set a benchmark in futility that still stands as an NHL record today, as the new franchise finished the year with a minuscule 21 points with the worst record in the 18-team league (8–67–5).\n\nSchmidt was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961 and his #15 jersey retired by the Bruins. After his retirement from hockey management, Schmidt remained involved with the Bruins through their alumni team and as manager of the \"Boards and Blades Club\" at the Boston Garden. On October 6, 2010 the Bruins celebrated Schmidt's 75 years with the team during \"Milt Schmidt Night\". On this night he received 2 commemorative Stanley Cup miniatures to represent the two cups he had brought to the club, plus he personally raised his number to the rafters inside TD Garden. He was the last surviving member of both the Bruins' 1939 and 1941 Stanley Cup teams. Schmidt was also the last living NHL player to play in the 1930s and the last to have played against the Montreal Maroons (a team that folded in 1938).\n\nOn October 20, 2016, Schmidt along with Bobby Orr dropped the ceremonial puck at the Boston Bruins' first home game of the season.\n\nSchmidt died after a stroke on January 4, 2017 in a retirement facility in Westwood, Massachusetts at the age of 98; at the time of his death he was the oldest living former NHL player, and the last living player to play in the AHL's inaugural season. Following Schmidt's death, Chick Webster became the oldest living NHL player. Schmidt is buried alongside his wife at the Highland Cemetery in Dover, Massachusetts\n\n\nNESN October 28, 2010\n"}
{"id": "2006149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006149", "title": "Mola (art form)", "text": "Mola (art form)\n\nThe \"Mola\", or \"Molas\", is a hand-made textile that forms part of the traditional women's clothing of the Kuna people from Panamá and parts of Colombia. The full costume includes a patterned wrapped skirt (saburet), a red and yellow headscarf (musue), arm and leg beads (wini), a gold nose ring (olasu) and earrings in addition to the mola blouse (dulemor).\n\nIn Dulegaya, the Guna's native language, \"mola\" means \"shirt\" or \"clothing\". The mola originated with the tradition of kuna women painting their bodies with geometric designs, using available natural colors; in later years these same designs were woven in cotton, and later still, sewn using cloth bought from the European settlers of Panamá.\n\nMolas have their origin in body painting. Only after colonization by the Spanish and contact with missionaries did the Guna start to transfer their traditional geometric designs on fabric, first by painting directly on the fabric and later by using the technique of reverse appliqué. It is not known for certain when this technique was first used. It seems to have originated in the second half of the nineteenth century.\n\nAs an inspiration for their designs, the Guna first used the geometrical patterns which have been used for body painting before. In the past 50 years, they have also depicted realistic and abstract designs of flowers, sea animals and birds, and popular culture.\n\nDepending on the tradition of each island, Guna women begin the crafting of molas either after they reach puberty, or at a much younger age. Women who prefer to dress in western style are in the minority as well as in the communities in Panama City.\n\nMolas have such an importance for the Guna people and their traditional identity that they can be considered responsible for the independent status of the Comarca Guna Yala. After the attempt of the Panamanian government to \"westernize\" the Guna in the beginning of the 20th century by prohibiting their customs, their language and their traditional dress, a huge wave of resistance arose. This resistance movement culminated in the Guna revolution of 1925 where, after heavy battles, the Panamanian government gave the Guna people the right to govern their own territory autonomously.\n\nMolas are hand-made using a reverse appliqué technique. Several layers (usually two to seven) of different-colored cloth (usually cotton) are sewn together; the design is then formed by cutting away parts of each layer. The edges of the layers are then turned under and sewn down. Often, the stitches are nearly invisible. This is achieved by using a thread the same color as the layer being sewn, sewing blind stitches, and sewing tiny stitches. The finest molas have extremely fine stitching, made using tiny needles.\nThe largest pattern is typically cut from the top layer, and progressively smaller patterns from each subsequent layer, thus revealing the colors beneath in successive layers. This basic scheme can be varied by cutting through multiple layers at once, hence varying the sequence of colours; some molas also incorporate patches of contrasting colours, included in the design at certain points to introduce additional variations of color.\n\nMolas vary greatly in quality, and the pricing to buyers varies accordingly. A greater number of layers is generally a sign of higher quality; two-layer molas are common, but examples with four or more layers will demand a better price. The quality of stitching is also a factor, with the stitching on the best molas being close to invisible. Although some molas rely on embroidery to some degree to enhance the design, those which are made using only the pure reverse-appliqué technique (or nearly so) are considered better.\n\nMolas will often be found for sale with signs of use, such as stitch marks around the edges; such imperfections indicate that the mola was made for use, and not simply for sale to tourists. A mola can take from two weeks to six months to make, depending on the complexity of the design.\n\nThe traditional costume of a Guna woman consists of a patterned blue cotton wrapped skirt, red and yellow headscarf, arm and leg beads, gold nose rings and earrings and the many layered and finely sewn mola panel blouse.\n\nThe artistry of a mola reflects a synthesis of traditional Guna culture with the influences of the modern world. Mola art developed when Guna women had access to store bought yard goods. Mola designs are often inspired by modern graphics such as political posters, labels, pictures from books and TV cartoons, as well as traditional themes from Guna legends and culture.\n\nGeometric molas are the most traditional, having developed from ancient body painting designs. Many hours of careful sewing are required to create a fine mola. The ability to make an outstanding mola is a source of status among Guna women.\n\nThe quality of a mola is determined by such factors as\n\n\nWhen Guna women tire of a particular blouse, they disassemble it and sell the molas to collectors.\n\nSince mola panels have been worn as part of the traditional dress of a Guna woman they often show signs of wear such as fading and stitch marks along the edges of the panels. These \"imperfections\" indicate that the mola is authentic and not made solely to be sold to tourists.\n\nMolas are often sold in pairs, the pair consisting of the back and front panels of a blouse. The two molas are usually two variations on a theme. Matched molas complement each other and should be displayed or used together for the greatest impact.\n\nMola panels have many uses. They can be framed as art or made into pillows, place mats or wall hangings. Some people even make them into bedspreads or incorporate them into quilting projects.\n\nMolas are very sturdy and well sewn. Authentic molas have already been washed many times and can be safely hand washed in warm water.\n\nMolas may be purchased in Panama or in Colombia.\n\nThe mola blouse is an important symbol of Guna culture.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2006157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006157", "title": "Buckbarrow", "text": "Buckbarrow\n\nBuckbarrow is a small fell in the English Lake District overlooking the western end of Wastwater. It is featured in Alfred Wainwright’s \"Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells\" and is given a height of 1,410 ft approximately; however, the Ordnance Survey and other guidebooks now give an altitude of 423 m (1,388 ft). The fell’s name means ‘The hill of the buck or goat’. It is derived either from the Old English word \"bucc\" meaning buck or the Old Norse word \"bokki\" meaning a male goat.\n\nThe Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south-east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long, wild valley. Buckbarrow is an outlier of the southern branch of the horseshoe.\n\nBuckbarrow is not really a separate hill, but just the craggy end of the southern ridge of the neighbouring fell of Seatallan, which reaches a height of 692 m (2,270 ft). Seatallan itself lies to the south of the main ridge, connecting to Haycock across the Pots of Ashness depression.\n\nSeatallan's south-western ridge falls gently at first across the broad green expanse of Nether Wasdale Common, finally narrowing to a point at Cat Bields (500 m or 1,640 ft), a mile from the summit. From here the slope continues in the same direction to the Greendale- Gosforth road, its progress only briefly interrupted by the few desultory rocks of Gray Crag. A smaller spur runs out south from Cat Bields, only resolving into a definite ridge some way down the slope at Glade How (435 m or 1,425 ft). This cairned top is recognised as a summit by some guidebooks. A little to the south of Glade How the spur ends in a wall of crag, dropping 900 ft to the road below. This is Buckbarrow.\n\nBuckbarrow's crags face the Wastwater Screes across the foot of the lake, aping their more famous neighbours in miniature. About three quarters of a mile in length, the principal features of Buckbarrow's southern face are Long Crag, Pike Crag, Bull Crag and Broad Crag. The western boundary is formed by Gill Beck, flowing between Buckbarrow and the main ridge of Seatallan. To the east the crags overlook Greendale Gill, the boundary with Middle Fell.\n\nThe northern parts of Buckbarrow, blending into the slopes of Seatallan, are overlain by drift deposits, much peat being in evidence around Glade How. The summit area shows outcropping of the Birker Fell Formation, an undivided sequence of generally plagioclase-phyric andesite lavas with subordinate sills. At the bottom of the slope are examples of granophyric microgranite, representative of the Ennerdale Intrusion. Dykes of basalt and dolerite run through both formations.\n\nThe nearest to an actual summit given the limited prominence is a rocky mound set back from the rim of crags. Much finer views can be obtained from the lower rocky knoll which stands above Pike Crag. Buckbarrow gives good views of Wast Water as well as the Wast Water Screes. The full length of the lake can be seen from Pike Crag, along with a fine view of Great Gable and the Scafells.\n\nThe fell is usually climbed from the minor road which runs along the base of the hill. From here Buckbarrow looks quite formidable and the crags are a deterrent to a direct ascent; however, all danger can be bypassed by starting the climb at the more westerly point of Harrow Head farm and following Gill Beck up to a height of around 350 m (1,150 ft) before bearing north easterly to the highest point above the crags. An alternative is to climb from Greendale, via Greendale Gill and Tongues Gills. Buckbarrow can also be bagged almost as an afterthought as the walker descends from Seatallan. Buckbarrow's formidable crags are a popular rock climbing venue.\n"}

He was named Rookie of the Year in 1934–35 and was the NHL scoring leader in 1935–36 and 1936–37. Schriner was named to honorary all-star teams in numerous leagues throughout his career and played with the NHL All-Stars in the Howie Morenz Memorial Game in 1937. He won two Stanley Cup championships with the Maple Leafs, in 1941–42 and 1944–45. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1962.\n\nThough his family emigrated to Canada when he was an infant, Schriner was the first Russian-born player in NHL history. He grew up in Calgary, where he played baseball in addition to hockey, and returned to the city following his career. He often assisted players at the University of Calgary; the Canada West Universities Athletic Association awards the David \"Sweeney\" Schriner Trophy to its top scorer each season.\n\nSchriner was born in Saratov in the Russian Empire; however, his family emigrated to Calgary, Alberta, Canada when he was a month old. He was a natural athlete and in his youth played football and soccer competitively, but was especially fond of hockey and baseball. His hero growing up was a semi-professional baseball player by the name of Bob Sweeney. Schriner emulated Sweeney's playing style and as a result earned the nickname \"L'il Sweeney\", later shortened to just \"Sweeney\". Schriner preferred his nickname so much that he refused to respond to anyone who addressed him by his given name of David.\n\nHe learned the game of hockey on Calgary's outdoor rinks and played his minor hockey in the city. Schriner was a member of the Calgary Canadians junior team that appeared in the Memorial Cup playdowns in both 1930 and 1931, before he turned to senior hockey with the Calgary Bronks. He was a top scorer in the Alberta Senior Hockey League; his 19 goals and 22 points in 1931–32 and 22 goals and 26 points in 1932–33 were all league-leading totals.\n\nThe New York Americans invited Schriner to their training camp in 1933. They were impressed with his skating ability and signed him to a contract to play for their International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate, the Syracuse Stars. He appeared in 44 games with the Stars in 1933–34 where he totaled 18 goals and 11 assists. The Americans promoted him to their lineup to start the 1934–35 NHL season, and in doing so, made Schriner one of the first Russian-born players in NHL history. He quickly emerged as an offensive star; he was third in scoring among players in the Canadian Division at the midway point of the season. The NHL named him rookie of the year after he finished the year with 18 goals and 40 points.\n\nSchriner continued to display his scoring ability in his second season. He scored four goals in a 5–5 tie with the Toronto Maple Leafs in the Americans' second game of the 1935–36 season, en route to a 45-point season that led the league in scoring. Additionally, the Canadian Press voted him to the First All-Star Team for the season. He again led the league in scoring in 1936–37, with 46 points, and was named to the Second All-Star Team. Prior to the start of the 1937–38 NHL season, Schriner played for the NHL All-Stars at the Howie Morenz Memorial Game. The game was a fundraiser to support the family of Howie Morenz, a Montreal Canadiens star who died due to complications following a broken leg suffered the previous season. Schriner scored one goal in a 6–5 victory by the All-Stars over the Canadiens.\n\nAfter five seasons in New York, the Americans dealt Schriner to the Maple Leafs in May 1939 in exchange for five players: Jimmy Fowler, Busher Jackson, Murray Armstrong, Doc Romnes and Buzz Boll. The five-for-one trade was unprecedented in the NHL at that time. Schriner remained an effective scorer in Toronto, where he earned his second First All-Star Team selection of his career in 1940–41. One year later, he was instrumental in the Leafs' comeback in the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals. He scored the tying and winning goals in Toronto's 3–1 victory in the seventh game against the Detroit Red Wings to win the Stanley Cup, a moment described as being one of his greatest thrills in hockey. It was Toronto's first championship in ten years, and the Maple Leafs became the first team in NHL history to overcome a 3–0 series deficit to win a best-of-seven playoff series with their victory over Detroit.\n\nFrustrated by what he felt was too much individualism in the game, Schriner contemplated retiring from professional hockey in favour of taking up a coaching position in Alberta's senior league. He had a change of heart and returned to the Leafs for the 1942–43 NHL season. Schriner again announced his intention to leave the game in June 1943, this time citing past injuries to his knee and dissatisfaction with Leafs' owner Conn Smythe's contract offer for the following season.\n\nLeaving Toronto, Schriner returned to Calgary and joined an Army/Navy team in the Alberta Garrison League for the 1943–44 campaign, where he was named to the military league's second all-star team at left wing. Following the local season, Schriner signed with the Vancouver St. Regis of the Pacific Coast Hockey League for their playoff run. He scored nine points in three games before a protest by the team's opponent resulted in both his and Vancouver's suspension by the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA). He was still considered a professional player, and thus ineligible to play senior hockey. Schriner appealed the decision, citing his position as a member of the Royal Canadian Naval Reserve. Rules of the time that automatically restored the amateur status of all active military personnel, however the CAHA ruled that a reserve officer was not the same as soldier on active duty. Schriner's participation in the series did not impact the outcome of the series as Vancouver was eliminated by the New Westminster Lodestars, who won all three games of the series.\n\nSchriner returned to the NHL and the Maple Leafs in 1944–45. He played two more years in Toronto before announcing his retirement for the third time in 1946. He returned to Alberta to coach the Lethbridge Maple Leafs of the Western Canada Senior Hockey League (WCSHL) for two seasons before once again returning to the ice as a player with the Regina Capitals. He finished fourth in WCSHL scoring in 1948–49 and was named to the league's second all-star team. Schriner and the Capitals won the WCSHL and Western Canadian championships, but fell to the Ottawa Senators in the 1949 Allan Cup final.\n\nFollowing the season, Schriner ended his playing career for the fourth and final time. He coached a season of senior hockey in Nova Scotia, after which he returned to Alberta where he briefly coached the Crow's Nest Pass Coalers in the Western Canada Junior Hockey League in 1951.\nSchriner was a durable player for much of his career. He played every game for his teams in his first six professional seasons, failing to miss a contest until his first year with the Maple Leafs. He was regarded as one of the best puck handlers of his time, and his 201 career NHL goals ranked him as one of the game's top goal scorers of his era. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1962, and the Canada West Universities Athletic Association awards the David \"Sweeney\" Schriner Trophy to its top scorer each season.\n\nFollowing his retirement, Schriner returned to his Calgary home and worked in the city's oil and gas industry until retiring from that career in 1977. He and his wife Marie had two children, Norman and Joanne, and he had one sister, Mary. Schriner remained active within sport, working with the Calgary Oldtimers Hockey Association and making frequent visits to the University of Calgary to speak with young players who viewed him as a role model. He became an avid curler and golfer in his retirement.\n"}

The band formed at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in 1976 as teenagers. In 1979, the group issued their first release, the EP \"U2-3\", which sold well in Ireland. The following year, the group signed to Island Records and released their debut album, \"Boy\". It reached number 52 in the UK and number 63 in the US. They followed it up with the release of \"October\" (1981) and \"War\" (1983). \"War\" was a commercial success, becoming the band's first number-one album in the UK while reaching number 12 in the US. The album yielded the singles \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"New Year's Day\", which have since become among the band's most popular songs. On the subsequent War Tour, the group recorded the live album \"Under a Blood Red Sky\" and concert film \"\", both of which sold well and helped establish them globally as a live act.\n\nThe band shifted towards a more ambient, abstract musical direction for \"The Unforgettable Fire\" (1984), their first collaboration with producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois. The album went to number one in the UK and produced the group's biggest hit to that point, the UK top-10 single \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\". The group's fifth album, \"The Joshua Tree\" (1987), made them international superstars and was a critical and commercial success, reaching number one in over 20 countries; it is one of the best-selling albums in the US (10 million copies shipped) and worldwide (25 million copies sold). It produced their only number-one singles in the US, \"With or Without You\" and \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\". U2 followed this up with the 1988 release of \"Rattle and Hum\", a double album and companion documentary film which documented their experiences with American roots music from the Joshua Tree Tour with a collection of new studio tracks, cover songs, and live recordings. The lead single \"Desire\" was the band's first number-one single in the UK. The album sold over 14 million copies, while the film grossed $8.6 million.\n\nFacing a backlash from \"Rattle and Hum\" and creative stagnation, U2 reinvented themselves musically in the 1990s. The band's following album, \"Achtung Baby\" (1991), marked a dramatic shift towards alternative rock, industrial music, and electronic dance music. It debuted at number one in the US, eventually sold 18 million copies worldwide, and spawned five singles, including \"One\", \"Mysterious Ways\", and the UK number-one \"The Fly\". U2's follow up albums \"Zooropa\" and \"Pop\" continued the band's experimentation with alternative rock and electronic dance music, reaching number one worldwide but with reduced sales. U2 regained commercial favour with the release of \"All That You Can't Leave Behind\" in 2000, returning to a more mainstream sound. The album sold over 12 million copies and won seven Grammy Awards. It spawned several successful singles, including \"Beautiful Day\", \"Walk On\", \"Elevation\", and \"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\". The following album, \"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\" (2004), was promoted with the popular lead single \"Vertigo\". The album was another commercial success and ultimately won all nine of its Grammy Award nominations. The group's twelfth album, \"No Line on the Horizon\" (2009), reached number one in 30 countries but its sales of 5 million were seen as a disappointment by the band, and it did not contain a hit single. Their 2014 album \"Songs of Innocence\" was released at no cost to over 500 million iTunes Store users but the pervasiveness of the promotion brought controversy; the album's sales and charting duration were among the weakest in the band's discography.\n\nU2 have sold 175 million records worldwide. With 52 million certified units by the RIAA, U2 rank as the 21st-highest-selling music artist in the US.

The film was directed by Edmund Goulding. The film is based on the 1946 novel of the same name, written by William Lindsay Gresham. Power, wishing to expand beyond the romantic and swashbuckler roles that brought him to fame, requested 20th Century Fox's studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck to buy the rights to the novel so he could star as the unsavory lead, \"The Great Stanton\", a scheming carnival barker.\n\nThe film premiered in the United States on October 9, 1947, then went into wide release on October 28, 1947, later having six more European releases between November 1947 to May 1954.\n\nAs noted on the DVD commentary track by Alain Silver and James Ursini, \"Nightmare Alley\" was somewhat unusual among film noir in having top stars, production staff and a relatively large budget. Despite a strong promotional campaign, the film was not a financial success upon its original release, due in part to protests against some of the scandalous content. The film has since found acclaim and is regarded as a classic.\n\nThe movie follows the rise and fall of a con man—a story that begins and ends at a seedy traveling carnival. The carnival's barker, Stanton \"Stan\" Carlisle (Tyrone Power), is fascinated by everything there, including a grotesque geek, who prompts an observation from Stanton that he \"can't understand how anybody could get so low.\" Stanton works with \"Mademoiselle Zeena\" (Joan Blondell) and her alcoholic husband, Pete (Ian Keith). Once a top-billed vaudeville act, Zeena and Pete used an ingenious code to make it appear that she had extraordinary mental powers, until her attentions to other men drove Pete to drink and reduced them to working in carnivals. Stanton learns that many people want to buy the code from Zeena for a lot of money but she refuses to sell; she is saving it as a nest egg.\n\nStanton tries to romance Zeena into teaching it to him but she remains faithful to Pete, feeling guilty over the role she played in his downfall and effectively nursemaiding him in the hope of some day sending him to a detox clinic for alcoholics. But one night in Texas, Stanton accidentally gives Pete the wrong bottle: the old man dies from drinking wood alcohol instead of moonshine. To keep her act going, Zeena is forced to teach Stanton the mind-reading code so that he can serve as her assistant.\n\nStanton prefers the company of the younger Molly (Coleen Gray). When their romance is found out, the remainder of the carnies including strongman Bruno (Mike Mazurki) force the pair into a shotgun marriage. No longer welcome in the carnival, Stanton realizes this is actually a golden opportunity for him. He and his wife leave the carnival. He becomes \"The Great Stanton\", performing to enraptured audiences in expensive nightclubs in Chicago. As well as things seem to be going, however, Stanton remains emotionally troubled by Pete's death and by his own part in it. He eventually seeks counseling from psychologist Lilith Ritter (Helen Walker), to whom he confesses all that has occurred.\n\nSince Lilith makes a point of recording all of her sessions with her patients, she has a compilation of sensitive information about the lives of various members of Chicago's social elite. Recognizing themselves as kindred spirits to a degree, Lilith and Stanton conspire together to manipulate her patients, with Lilith secretly providing private information about them and Stanton using that information to convince them that he can communicate with the dead. The plan almost works, until Stanton tries to swindle skeptical Ezra Grindle (Taylor Holmes) by having Molly pose as the ghost of Grindle's long-lost love. When the heartbroken Grindle breaks down, Molly refuses to play out the charade and reveals her true self to Grindle, thereby exposing Stanton as a fake. As he prepares to flee, Stanton discovers he has been scammed by Ritter, who gives him only $150 of Grindle's money rather than the promised $150,000 they had conned him out of to that point. With her recordings of Stanton's confessions to her available for use against him, Lilith threatens to testify that he is mentally disturbed should he accuse her of complicity in his crimes. Defeated, Stanton gives the $150 to Molly and urges her return to the carnival world where people care for her. Meanwhile, he gradually sinks into alcoholism.\n\nWith nowhere else to go, the fallen Stanton tries to get a job at another carnival, only to suffer the ultimate degradation: the only job he can get is playing the geek, eating live chickens in a sideshow and replying to the offer with his recurring catchphrase, \"Mister, I was made for it.\" Unable to stand his life any further, he goes berserk. Fortunately, Molly happens to work in the same carnival. Stan regains hope when he sees her again and Molly vows to nurse him back to health, but their reunion is bittersweet, recalling Zeena's nursing the ever-drunk Pete. This conclusion, while somewhat dark and ambiguous, differed from the novel, which implied that Stanton is doomed to work as a geek until he drinks himself to death.\n\n\nTyrone Power, wishing to expand beyond the romantic and swashbuckler roles that brought him to fame, requested 20th Century Fox's studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck to buy the rights to the novel so he could star in it. Fox paid $50,000 in September 1946 for the rights to Gresham's novel, and Gresham was hired as consultant to help screenwriter Jules Furthman, although the extent of his contribution to the script is not clear.\n\nIn November 1946, it was reported that Mark Stevens and Anne Baxter were to star in the film, and that William Keighley would be the director. By January 1947, Lloyd Bacon was the reported director.\n\nTo make the film more believable, the producers built a full working carnival on ten acres (40,000 m) of the 20th Century Fox back lot. They also hired over 100 sideshow attractions and carnival people to add further authenticity. Filming also took place at the San Diego County Fair in Del Mar, California.\n\nThe slightly upbeat ending of the film was added by screenwriter Furthman at Zanuck's direction, softening the harsh ending of Gresham's novel.\n\nAuthor William Lindsay Gresham committed suicide by sleeping pills on September 14, 1962 in the same room in the Hotel Carter where he wrote the first draft of \"Nightmare Alley\".\n\nOn the film's original release, reviews were mixed, and the film was a box-office flop.\n\n\"The New York Times\" review commented,\nIf one can take any moral value out of \"Nightmare Alley\" it would seem to be that a terrible retribution is the inevitable consequence for he who would mockingly attempt to play God. Otherwise, the experience would not be very rewarding for, despite some fine and intense acting by Mr. Power and others, this film traverses distasteful dramatic ground and only rarely does it achieve any substance as entertainment.\n\nThe \"Variety\" review complimented the film's acting, noting that:\n\"Nightmare Alley\" is a harsh, brutal story [based on the novel by William Lindsay Gresham] told with the sharp clarity of an etching ... Most vivid of these is Joan Blondell as the girl he works for the secrets of the mind-reading act. Coleen Gray is sympathetic and convincing as his steadfast wife and partner in his act and Helen Walker comes through successfully as the calculating femme who topples Power from the heights of fortune back to degradation as the geek in the carney. Ian Keith is outstanding as Blondell's drunken husband.\n\nIn \"Time\" magazine (November 24, 1947), film critic James Agee wrote:\n\"Nightmare Alley\" would be unbearably brutal for general audiences if it were played for all the humour, cynicism and malign social observation that are implicit in it. It would be unbearably mawkish if it were played too solemnly. Scripter Jules Furthman and Director Edmund Goulding have steered a middle course, now and then crudely but on the whole with tact, skill and power. They have seldom forgotten that the original novel they were adapting is essentially intelligent trash, and they have never forgotten that on the screen pretty exciting things can be made of trash. From top to bottom of the cast, the playing is good. Joan Blondell, as the fading carnival queen, is excellent and Tyrone Power – who asked to be cast in the picture – steps into a new class as an actor (Agee on Film: Criticism and Comment on the Movies, Modern Library, New York, 2000, page 369).\n\nIn a 2000 review of the film in \"The Village Voice\", writer J. Hoberman commented, \"This 1947 account of an archetypal American's rise and fall is neither a great movie nor even a classic noir but it has a great ambition to be daring and, once seen, is not easily forgotten. The movie suggested far more than it showed but what it showed, including the climactic degradation of 20th Century Fox's then-major star Tyrone Power, was remarkably sordid for so high-profile a release.\"\n\nThe film is now regarded as \"one of the gems of film noir\" and as one of Power's finest performances. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected 11 reviews and gave the film a 100% approval rating, with an average rating of 7.8/10.\n\nOn December 12, 2017, Fox Searchlight Pictures announced that Guillermo del Toro will direct a new adaptation of the novel, co-writing the screenplay with Kim Morgan. In April 2019, Leonardo DiCaprio was negotiating to star in del Toro's film. In August 2019, it was reported that Cate Blanchett was negotiating to co-star with Bradley Cooper in the film, which is scheduled to starting shooting in early 2020. On September 4, 2019, Rooney Mara was cast in the film.\n\n"}

{"id": "2006208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006208", "title": "Shenoute", "text": "Shenoute\n\nShenoute of Atripe, also known as Shenoute the Great or Saint Shenoute the Archimandrite (Coptic: ; (347-465 or 348-466) was the abbot of the White Monastery in Egypt. He is considered a saint by the Oriental Orthodox Churches, and is one of the most renowned saints of the Coptic Orthodox Church.\n\nShenoute was born in the middle of the fourth century AD (the date 348 AD, often mentioned but not universally accepted, is based on an inscription in his monastery, dating from the twelfth or thirteen century).\n\nAround 385 AD, Shenoute became the father of the White Monastery in Upper Egypt. It has often been assumed that Shenoute was the immediate successor of the White Monastery's founder, Pcol. However, the reconstruction of Shenoute's literary corpus made it possible to realize that Pcol died in the 370s and was then succeeded not by Shenoute but by another father, Ebonh, and that a spiritual crisis during Ebonh's tenure as head of the White Monastery, a crisis which seems to have involved carnal sin, enabled Shenoute to come to prominence and to become Ebonh's immediate successor.\n\nBecause of his popularity in Upper Egypt and his zeal for Orthodoxy, Shenoute was chosen by Saint Cyril the Great to accompany him in representing the Church of Alexandria at the Ecumenical Council of Ephesus in 431 AD. There he provided the moral support that Saint Cyril needed to defeat the heresy of Nestorius, Bishop of Constantinople. The eventual exile of the latter to Akhmim, Shenoute's backyard, was a testimony to the impression that Shenoute had made upon the attendees of this council.\n\nOn 7 Epip (14 July) 466 AD, following a short illness possibly brought upon by advanced age, Shenoute died in the presence of his monks.\n\nFrom his uncle, Saint Pigol, Shenoute inherited a monastery based on the Pachomian system, though more austere and stringent. This made its followers few in number and probably promoted decline rather than growth. Shenoute implemented a more comprehensive system that was less stringent and more suitable to the surroundings and the background of the people. This new system had an unusual component, which was a covenant (diatheke) to be recited and adhered to literally by the new novices. It read as follows:\n\nTransgressors of that covenant were expelled from the monastery altogether. This was considered a near death sentence for those peasant monks.\n\nAnother interesting feature of Shenoute's monastic system was the requirement for the new novices to live outside the monastery for a period of time before they were deemed worthy to be consecrated as monks. This seemed to be at odds with the Nitrian monastic system, which allowed the monks to live away from the monastic settlements only after they became proficient in the monastic life. Shenoute also utilized the time of the monks, outside prayer and worship, in more varied tasks within the monastery than the Nitrian monks were exposed to. Aside from the traditional trades of rope and basket weaving, the monks engaged in weaving and tailoring linen, cultivation of flax, leather work and shoe-making, writing and book-binding, carpentry, and metal and pottering-making. All in all, Shenouda tried as much as possible to employ the monks in their old professions. Such activities made the monastery a vast self-supporting complex, which occupied some of land.\n\nAs a monastic leader, Shenoute recognized the need for literacy among the monk. So he required all his monks and nuns to learn to read and encouraged more of them to pursue the art of writing manuscripts. This made the monastery more and more appealing to belong to and consequently made the threat of expulsion more painful.\n\nIn his laudatory \"Life of Saint Shenoute\", his disciple Saint Wissa (Besa) recounts several incidents of Shenoute coming to the aid of poor Coptic peasants. One time he went to Akhmim to chastise a pagan because of the oppression he was inflecting on the poor (Vita #81-2). Another time he acted to eliminate the cause of grief of the peasants, that the pagan landlords of Paneleou forced to buy their spoiled wine (Vita #85-6). On a third occasion he risked his life to successfully ask for the freedom of the captives at Psoi from the hands of the Blemmyes warriors (Vita #89). He also at times appealed on behalf of the peasants to those in power, including the Roman emperor Theodosius I. In summary, Shenoute fully recognized the misery of his people and emerged as their sincere advocate and popular leader.\n\nTo talk about Shenoute's writing is to discuss Coptic literature at its best. He wrote in a style that was essentially his own, with writings based on a careful study of the scholastic rhetoric of his time, which displayed the wide and deep range of knowledge he possessed. They were adorned with endless quotations from the Holy Scriptures, a typical feature of patristic writings. The scriptures were quoted whenever a presented argument needed support. In doing so Shenoute also displayed an astonishing memory as he rendered these passages with amazing accuracy.\n\nShenoute's knowledge was not confined to the Holy Bible, as it was the case for the majority of the monks in Egypt. He was fluent in both Coptic and Greek, and was fairly well acquainted with Greek thought and theology. The sprinkling of Greek loan-words in his writings was both extensive and sophisticated, and it was definitely not a product of his living environment. He also expressed knowledge of the works of Aristotle, Aristophanes, the Platonic school, and even some of the Greek legends. He certainly read some of Saint Athanasius' works like the Life of Saint Anthony and some of his homiletic works. Shenoute also knew the letters of Saint Anthony, some of the letters of Saint Pachomius, and most likely some of the works of Evagrius. His knowledge further extended to such popular non-canonical texts as the Acts of Archelaus and the Gospel of Thomas.\n\nThe writing of Saint Shenoute can be grouped into four categories:\n\nAs more and more identifications of Saint Shenoute's literary works are made, his contribution to Coptic literature appears to be even greater than previously assumed. On the one hand, it is becoming clear that he treated a wide range of subjects, not only monastic ones. This suggests a more favorable assessment of the theological character of his writing, his spirituality, and his moral and nationalistic behavior. On the other hand, he accepted the inclusion of literary activity in the religious field. This sets him apart from the Pachomian system that tended to treat religious literature as mere written instructions with no regard to style being given. He further developed a style that is clearly a product of careful study of the scholastic Greek rhetoric of his time.\n\nFour Coptic Orthodox monasteries worldwide are named after Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite, namely:\n\nThere is also a Coptic Orthodox church – St. Mary and St. Shenouda – in Coulsdon, England.\n\n\n"}

Seibert was one of the first players to turn professional in 1904. Seibert is the father of Earl Seibert who played professionally in the National Hockey League.\n\nOliver Seibert was born in 1881 in Berlin, Ontario to Franklin and Sarah (née Bedford) Seibert. He was the second of fourteen children. Seibert married Emma Fuhrman on November 6, 1901. They had six children: May, Roy, Vera, Earl, Ruth and Doris. Seibert's profession on the 1911 Canadian census is listed as shop machinist. His grandfather on his father's side, Jacob E. Seibert was born in Bavaria, Germany and his grandmother on his father's side can be traced back to Switzerland. His mother was born in England, of English parents, who emigrated to Canada. Fuhrman's parents were born in Germany.\n\nSeibert died on May 15, 1944 of a stroke, at his home on 79 Elgin Street in Kitchener, Ontario.\n\nThe Seibert family had enough hockey players that the family organized its own team of Oliver, Edward, Nelson, Clarence, Bert, Shannon and Frank. (In that era, teams played seven men per side). Seibert was recognized for his skating skill and speed. There are conflicting accounts of Oliver, or his father, defeating a horse in a match race on the ice.\n\nSeibert first played senior-level hockey with the Berlin Rangers in the Western Ontario Hockey Association (WOHA) in 1900. He played two years with Berlin before switching to Guelph for 1902. He returned and played one further seasons for Berlin. He was a member of Western Ontario Senior championship teams for 1900, 1901, 1902 and 1904. The Berlin team played an exhibition game in St. Louis, Missouri; it is considered one of the first games of ice hockey played on artificial ice. After the WOHA was absorbed into the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA), Seibert was declared ineligible to play in the OHA on December 30, 1904, which eliminated the possibility of play in Ontario.\n\nOn January 31, 1905, Seibert signed with the professional Canadian Soo of the International Professional Hockey League (IPHL) for $30 per week and board. He only played one game with the Soo, suffering a season-ending broken leg in his first game against Calumet on February 2, 1905. Seibert later played professional hockey for London, Ontario and Guelph in the Ontario Professional Hockey League. The Royals played in the OPHL during the 1908–09 season. He also played professional in the Northwestern Michigan League.\n\nSeibert was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961. He is also an inductee in the Waterloo Region Hall of Fame. His son Earl Seibert is also a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame and the Waterloo Region Hall of Fame.\n"}

Originally conceived to be a three-part harmony, it was later decided to separate out the voices that started each verse.\n\nSome music critics have suggested Phil Collins' 1985 song \"Sussudio\" sounds very similar to \"1999\".

{"id": "2006219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006219", "title": "New Hampshire Route 26", "text": "New Hampshire Route 26\n\nNew Hampshire Route 26 (abbreviated NH 26) is a state highway located in northern New Hampshire. It runs across the state in a roughly northwest-to-southeast trajectory, stretching from the Vermont border in the west to the Maine border in the east. NH 26 is a multi-state route with both states.\n\nAt its western end, NH 26 connects to Vermont Route 102 in Lemington via the extremely short, yet fully designated Vermont Route 26 (VT 26). At in length, it is by far the shortest state route in Vermont. At its eastern end, NH 26 meets Maine State Route 26 which connects with the city of Portland in the south.\n\nThe number 26 dates from 1922, when the multi-state route was first designated New England Interstate Route 26 as part of the New England road marking system of the 1920s.\n\nNH 26 is a mostly isolated highway which runs through mountainous terrain. The highway begins in the west at the state line between Lemington, Vermont and Colebrook, New Hampshire along the Connecticut River. It is connected to Vermont Route 102 via the short stub highway VT 26. The highway runs east into downtown Colebrook where it intersects with U.S. Route 3. NH 26 briefly overlaps with US 3 before splitting off east again towards Dixville (the southern end of the overlap is the historic northern terminus of New England Interstate Route 26). From Colebrook to Dixville, NH 26 runs tightly along the Mohawk River, a tributary of the Connecticut. NH 26 runs through Dixville Notch, a mountain pass of the northernmost White Mountains at an altitude of approximately , which has its own state park. The site of the Balsams Grand Resort Hotel, which opened during the Civil War but was closed in 2011, is also located along NH 26. After leaving Dixville (which the \"Notch\" is a part of) NH 26 nicks the northeastern corner of the township of Millsfield before entering the town of Errol, where it meets its only other major intersection at NH 16. The two routes are briefly cosigned in the downtown area before NH 16 splits off to the northeast. NH 26, heading southeast, crosses the Androscoggin River and then runs along the southwestern side of Umbagog Lake. It passes through the northeastern corner of the township of Cambridge before crossing into Upton, Maine and continuing as Maine State Route 26 south (SR 26 is a north-south highway).\n\nVermont Route 26 is the short connection between Vermont Route 102 and the New Hampshire state line. It is only long, but is signed and recognized by VTrans as a state route. It is by far the shortest state route in Vermont. The next shortest, Vermont Route 119 (another of many short connectors of multi-state routes in Vermont), is about six times longer at .\n\nThe entirety of modern NH 26, VT 26 and Maine State Route 26 were initially designated New England Interstate Route 26 (NEI 26) as part of the New England road marking system introduced in 1922, following nearly the same exact route as today. NEI 26 was known as the Dixville Notch Way and originally stretched from Portland in the south (where it connected to New England Interstate Route 1 - modern U.S. Route 1) to Colebrook in the north (where it connected to New England Interstate Route 6 - modern U.S. Route 3). At some point, the route was extended to the Vermont state border to connect with what is now Vermont Route 102 in Lemington. In 1925, the United States Numbered Highways supplanted the New England Interstate system and NEI 26 was redesignated as a set of state highways bearing the number 26. The New Hampshire (and by extension, Vermont) section of the roadway has not undergone any significant changes since then.\n\nNEI 26 was clearly intended to be a north-south highway, which SR 26 in Maine illustrates. However, NH 26 is signed as an east-west highway, reflecting its orientation within the state. This means that, in driving the old Interstate route from south to north, mileposts on NH 26 will actually be decreasing since mileposts normally increase from west to east.\n"}
{"id": "2006224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006224", "title": "John Philip Sousa Bridge", "text": "John Philip Sousa Bridge\n\nThe John Philip Sousa Bridge, also known as the Sousa Bridge and the Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge, is a continuous steel plate girder bridge that carries Pennsylvania Avenue SE across the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C., in the United States. The bridge is named for famous United States Marine Band conductor and composer John Philip Sousa, who grew up near the bridge's northwestern terminus.\n\nThe first bridge at this location was constructed in 1804, but burned by United States armed forces in 1814 during the War of 1812. It was replaced in 1815, but the bridge burned to the waterline in 1846. The rapid growth of residential developments east of the Anacostia River led to the construction of a narrow, iron girder bridge in 1890. This bridge led to even swifter economic and residential development of the area. Efforts to replace the 1890 bridge with a modern structure began in 1931, but were not successful until 1938. The downstream (southern) span opened on December 9, 1939, to great fanfare. The upstream span was completed on January 18, 1941.\n\nThe Sousa Bridge has a partial interchange with the Barney Circle traffic circle at its northwestern end, and a partial interchange with Anacostia Freeway at its southeastern terminus. A major battle over building an Inner Loop Expressway in the District of Columbia occurred in the 1950s and 1960s. This led to the partial construction of Interstate 695 from Interstate 395 to Barney Circle, but political battles over the wisdom of further construction led to cancellation of the remaining highway—leaving Barney Circle and the northern approaches to the Sousa Bridge partially deconstructed. An attempt to build the remainder of Interstate 695 (the \"Barney Circle Freeway\") in the 1990s also failed. In 2010, the District of Columbia decommissioned the portion of Interstate 695 leading to Barney Circle and the Sousa Bridge, and began rebuilding the circle and approaches.\n\nThe village of Georgetown in what later became the District of Columbia was founded in 1745. A road ran generally southeast along what is today Pennsylvania Avenue NW to Capitol Hill, and then along a slightly more southerly course than present-day Pennsylvania Avenue SE to stop at the intersection of what was then Virginia Avenue SE, M Street SE, and 14th Street SE on the shores of the Anacostia River (then known as the \"Eastern Branch\"). Aquila Wheeler had a ferry there which he used to take people across the river to the Upper Marlboro Turnpike (now Pennsylvania Avenue SE). This ferry was known as the Upper Ferry, distinguishing it from the Lower Ferry (which ran from Barry's Wharf near the intersection of New Jersey Avenue SE and O Street SE across the Anacosita to Poplar Point). Wheeler died in 1796, and his widow, Elizabeth, operated the ferry until she was declared insane in 1799.\n\nIn 1795, Daniel Carroll, William Duncanson, Thomas Law, Notley Young, George Walker, and Matthew Wigfield petitioned the Maryland General Assembly for permission to construct a bascule bridge over the Anacostia River. On December 24, 1795, the Maryland legislature adopted a bill authorizing the bridge. The Maryland act required that the bridge be constructed at the base of Kentucky Avenue SE (less than a hundred feet downstream from the terminus of the current bridge). (William Young, Elizabeth Wheeler's brother and a relative of Notley Young's, owned this land.) Its southeastern terminus was to be on land owned by Wigfield. It was authorized by law to collect tolls, although these could be no higher than the market average. A corporation, the Eastern Branch Bridge Co., was formed to build the bridge. It issued 225 shares at $200 a share, with dividends to be paid from tolls collected on the bridge. Under the terms of the legislature's bill, title to the bridge reverted to the state of Maryland after 30 years. The corporation didn't act with much urgency. It was not until March 18, 1801, that stock in the firm was sold, but even then $43,000 was quickly raised.\n\nThe bridge was completed and opened for traffic in January 1804. The bridge was wide and had a draw span wide. Its abutments were of stone, but its piers were wood. Construction of the bridge allowed Pennsylvania Avenue to be extended across the Anacostia River for the first time. A major flood struck the Anacostia River on July 8, 1804, and piled logs and fence posts against the bridge. It survived.\n\nThe bridge did not survive the War of 1812. The United States Army suffered an ignominious defeat in the Battle of Bladensburg on August 24, 1814, leaving the city of Washington open to the British Army. The Eastern Branch bridge was one of only three land routes into the city. Early in the afternoon, Captain John Creighton, a United States Navy officer, burned the bridge to the waterline.\n\nThe Eastern Branch Bridge Co. sued the U.S. Navy for burning its bridge. To quiet the suit, Congress appropriated $20,000 (another source says $20,500) to pay the bridge's investors. The bridge company used some of this money to rebuild, and a wooden bascule span bridge reopened in the same spot in 1815. Now often called the Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge, it operated as a toll bridge from 1815 to 1841. It deteriorated over time, and in 1841 was closed to vehicular traffic (but remained open for foot traffic).\n\nIn 1846, a steamship attempting to go up the Anacostia became wedged in the draw span. Sparks from the ship's funnel ignited the bridge, and it burned to the water line. For many years thereafter, the pilings of the old bridge could be seen when the water level in the river was low.\n\nNo bridge connected the east and west ends of Pennsylvania Avenue SE over the Anacostia River between 1845 and 1890. Benning Bridge, erected upstream in 1805, and the 11th Street Bridges, built downstream in 1820, also carried vehicular and foot traffic over the Ancostia. But the Uniontown \"suburb\" was platted in the Anacostia area in 1854, and development slowly began to turn the agricultural land into businesses and residences. The destruction of the Eastern Branch Bridge in 1846, however, significantly slowed growth in the area for five decades.\n\nAbout 1871, a real estate development known as \"East Washington Heights\" began. Citizens in the area wanted a bridge to reconnect \"their\" Pennsylvania Avenue (which ran through the center of their neighborhoods) with the Pennsylvania Avenue \"in the city\". Building a new bridge over the Anacostia River only slowly became an issue for them, and it was not until 1875 that the EWCA began agitating for one. A new bridge, the EWCA pointed out, would save residents of East Washington in travel every time they visited the city center on the other side of the river. On February 19, 1886, the EWCA formed a committee to lobby the Commissioners of the District of Columbia (the city government) and Congress on the issue.\n\nLater that year, Representative Barnes Compton (D-Maryland) introduced legislation in Congress to build a $60,000 bridge of wood on wooden piers. But the Compton bill was strongly opposed by the D.C. Commissioners. The legislation required that the city pay half the cost of the structure, and Commissioner Samuel E. Wheatley led the city government in adamantly refusing to support the bill. A group of EWCA members began personally lobbying Congress for the bridge. Samuel Taylor Suit, a state senator in the Maryland legislature, won passage of a resolution by that state supporting the bridge. These efforts proved highly successful. Senator Blackburn and Representative Rowell won a $40,000 increase in the amount appropriated for the bridge, and inserted language into the bill requiring that it be constructed of iron and be set on stone piers. This legislation passed both chambers of Congress unanimously on February 23, 1887.\n\nConstruction of the new bridge began in November 1887. Complications arose when the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (B&PR), whose tracks ran along the north/eastern shore of the Anacostia River, sued the federal government, arguing that the bridge abutment encroached on its right-of-way; eventually the railroad agreed to move its tracks closer to the riverbank, and the federal government paid for the move. But yet more construction delays occurred. Due to the heavily silted bottom of the river, the Army Corps of Engineers could not find solid ground on which to build the bridge's piers and abutments, requiring construction of a cofferdam and extensive excavation and investigation of the riverbed. A major flood in 1888 damaged some of the work, and caused further delays.\n\nThe new Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge, as it became known, was complete in June 1890. The EWCA decided, however, to delay the bridge's formal dedication and opening until August 25, which was the anniversary of the 1805 bridge's destruction in the War of 1812. The new bridge's dedication was a major even in the history of Washington, D.C. Some 8,000 to 10,000 people attended the event, which included the United States Marine Band, conducted by John Philip Sousa, providing music throughout the afternoon and evening. The total cost of the bridge was $170,000.\n\nConstruction of the 1890 bridge led to extensive new development east of the river. As the bridge was being built in 1889, a consortium known as the Bliss-Havemeyer Syndicate purchased of land in the former East Washington Heights development. They built a number of roads in the area, and landscaped the plots along Pennsylvania Avenue SE, Alabama Avenue SE, and Branch Avenue SE with gardens, orchards, pavilions, and shade trees. In 1903, Colonel Arthur E. Randle formed the United States Realty Company, bought out the Bliss-Havemeyer Syndicate properties, and founded the settlement of Randle Highlands. In 1902, Randle won approval from Congress to lay streetcar tracks across the Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge. By 1905, he had extended his line down Pennsylvania Avenue SE into the new Randle Highlands. The streetcar line over the bridge spurred extensive new development east of the river. Randle began selling lots in Randle Highlands at a brisk pace in 1903. He made so much money that by 1905 he formed the development of \"North Randle Highlands\" (now the neighborhoods of Dupont Park, Penn Branch, and the lower portion of Greenway), which extended to Massachusetts Avenue SE. In October 1906, \"The Washington Post\" called Randle's developments \"among the largest real estate enterprises ever successfully carried through in the District.\"\n\nAs early as 1931, the Randle Highlands Citizens Association (the former East Washington Citizens Association changed its name in 1908) began pressing city government to replace the aging, inadequate Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge.\n\nThe campaign to replace the Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge began in earnest in January 1934. The Randle Highlands Citizens Association issued a report to the House Committee on Appropriations asking for a $15,000 grant to study the need for and design of a new bridge. The report noted that roadways with a combined width of approached the bridge, leading to extensive and dangerous traffic congestion. The citizens association asked that a new bridge, with a roadway and sidewalks on both sides be constructed. But their request was not acted on. In late summer 1934, Southeast resident Vernis Absher was told by Representative Thomas L. Blanton (who had opposed the bridge) that Congress did not believe citizens of Southeast D.C. were united behind the bridge. Citizens recommended four different locations for a new span, and Congress did not want to get caught in the middle of a political battle over the structure's location. Absher subsequently contacted 11 different citizens' associations in the area, and on September 5, 1934, they agreed to form the Southeast Council of Citizens Associations to speak with one voice for the area.\n\nIn January 1935, the City Commissioners submitted a city budget to Congress requesting $15,000 to study a new bridge. The budget won the approval of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration and the Bureau of the Budget. A handful of representatives in the House stripped the item from the city budget. Although the item was restored in the Senate, it was removed again in the conference committee. The bridge suffered partial collapse in the early summer of 1935 when a portion of the wooden timbers supporting the road deck collapsed, requiring replacement. The damage was not extensive, however, and the bridge was still considered to be structurally sound. However, the Corps of Engineers limited the weight of vehicles permitted to cross the structure. But in August 1935 the Southeast Businessmen's Association (a group of east-of-the-river business owners) threatened to petition the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration for a new bridge. If that failed, they warned they would seek a redress of grievances in federal court.\n\nA third push for the bridge occurred in 1936. Although the Great Depression in the United States was improving, there was a significant effort being made to balance the federal budget. (This budget-tightening would significantly contribute to the Recession of 1937–38.) City commissioners submitted a budget of $47.9 million to the Bureau of the Budget, but saw $4.3 million cut from it. However, a request for $25,000 for a bridge study was retained. On January 21, the Southeast Businessmen's Association and several citizen associations in the area sent a letter to the Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations and to the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Appropriations asking for appropriation of the study funds. In addition to underscoring the dangerous nature of the traffic problems and the deleterious economic effect the out-of-date bridge created, they pointed out that the 67,337 people living east of the river paid 15.5 percent of all city tax revenues but received just 3 percent of its expenditures. On April 6, the Federation of Citizens Association (an umbrella group representing all citizens associations in the city) endorsed the study request in a hearing before the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Appropriations. The fate of the District's budget was placed in jeopardy on May 21, 1936, when Representative Thomas L. Blanton (D-Texas) refused to compromise with Senate conference committee members on a wide range of issues (including the \"federal payment\" to the city's budget). The city was faced with the prospect of having no budget, and all its funding directly approved by President Roosevelt as \"relief\". With Congress racing to a June 20 adjournment, Roosevelt threw his weight behind the Senate. Although the House initially resisted, the final bill (with only minor changes from the Senate version) passed on June 19 and was signed into law by President Roosevelt on June 23. It included the hard-won $25,000 appropriation for a Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge study.\n\nAs Captain Herbert C. Whitehurst of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prepared to conduct the study, the Washington Board of Trade prepared for a positive outcome. On July 2, it voted to create a committee to lobby Congress for the funds to build the new bridge. Twelve days later, the Southeast Business Men's Association formed a committee to lobby the District Commissioners for a $750,000 appropriation to build a new bridge.\n\nCaptain Whitehurst's study, as expected, recommended approval of a new bridge in the same location as the existing bridge, and in President Roosevelt's fiscal 1938 budget for the city $325,000 was recommended to begin construction. This would allow surveys and designs to be completed. The total cost of the new span was estimated at $1.25 million. The Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, however, stripped the funding for a new bridge and inserted a $40,000 appropriation for repairs instead, after concluding that rising steel prices meant a new bridge could not be constructed for less than $2 million. The Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee restored the $325,000 appropriation on June 5. The full Senate adopted the subcommittee's recommendation on June 8. But the conference committee stripped the appropriation from the final bill.\n\nThe new bridge received its name when the Southeast Citizens Association (led by member Orrin J. Davy) asked that the bridge be named for the Sousa (the \"March King\"), who died in 1932. Senator Royal S. Copeland (D-New York) introduced a resolution (S. 2651) on June 15, 1937, ordering the bridge to be named after famed composer, conductor, and D.C. native John Philip Sousa. The bill passed the Senate, but was not taken up in the House. Copeland reintroduced the measure (S. 494) on January 10, 1939, and it passed both houses of Congress on February 27. President Roosevelt signed it into law (Public Law No. 5) on March 7, 1939.\n\nMeanwhile, Captain Whithurst's preliminary design for the bridge was approved by both the National Capital Planning Commission and the United States Commission of Fine Arts.\n\nAs the city began crafting is fiscal 1939 budget, Captain Whitehurst adopted a new legislative strategy. He submitted to the City Commissioners a five-year plan laying out all transportation infrastructure requirements for the national capital, prioritizing each item. Colonel Dan L. Sultan, the Engineer Commissioner, subsequently distributed Whitehurst's strategic plan to a wide range of federal agencies, private companies (such as utilities and streetcar companies), and citizen groups, seeking their input. The top priority for bridge construction was a new Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge. Whitehurst proposed spending $650,000 in fiscal 1939 to survey and design the structure and begin its construction. Whitehurst's proposal received the immediate support of the Hillcrest Citizens Association, which began lobbying the District Commissioners to seek the appropriation yet again.\n\nThe City Commissioners duly submitted the budget request, and on January 6, 1938, the Bureau of the Budget submitted to Congress a city budget that listed an underpass at Dupont Circle and the new Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge as its top transportation infrastructure priorities. The authorized cost of the bridge was $2 million, with a 1939 appropriation of $650,000. But the chair of the Subcommittee on Appropriations in the House, Representative Ross A. Collins (D-Mississippi), argued that a far more important project was the K Street viaduct, a proposed elevated highway over K Street NW and Water Street NW between 26th Street NW and Key Bridge. As there was no opposition to the Dupont Circle underpass on fiscal grounds, the bridge appropriation would be deleted. The subcommittee also added funds for the Thomas Circle underpass. The Washington Board of Trade's bridge committee was outraged, and called for protests by all citizens associations in the city. Adelbert W. Lee, chair of the bridge committee, pointed out that more than 15,000 vehicles a day crossed the bridge (the oldest in the city), and that modern firefighting equipment could not cross the bridge due to weight restrictions. Lee said Collins' claim about opposition was untrue, and that both the Dupont Circle and Thomas Circle underpasses were opposed by some citizens while not a single protest had been registered against the bridge proposal. Nonetheless, the bill went to the House floor on January 27, 1938, without the bridge appropriation. Representative Stephen Warfield Gambrill (D-Maryland) attempted to amend the bill on the floor of the House on February 1 by restoring the funds, but the amendment was not offered after Collins won a Point of order vote against it. On February 5, the Federation of Citizens Associations passed a resolution advocating cancellation of all underpass construction so that the Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge could be rebuilt.\n\nIn the Subcommittee on Appropriations in the Senate, however, Senator Millard Tydings (D-Maryland) said he would seek to add the bridged appropriation (although he would not hold up the bill if the effort failed). Senator Elmer Thomas (D-Oklahoma) demanded that if Tydings' effort was successful that other projects be cut so as not to raise the overall cost of the bill. Members of the Northeast Washington Citizens Association and the Congress Heights Citizens Association both testified in favor of the Tydings amendment. The subcommittee restored the appropriation on March 2 at a reported $620,000, cancelling the Dupont and Thomas Circle underpasses and the K Street viaduct. The full Appropriations Committee approved the bill on March 3. A conference committee agreed on March 14 to adopt a conference bill that included the bridge appropriation at the Senate level, and the final bill passed Congress on May 18.\n\nWith funding for the bridge secured, Captain Whitehurst said that plans for the structure should be finalized on June 1, 1938. The construction schedule provide for advertising of contracts in June, and work to begin in mid-August. The downstream span of the structure would be completed before the current bridge was dismantled and a new span built in its place. The total timeframe for construction was 25 to 31 months. The Commission of Fine Arts recommended that the bridge be faced in pink granite. The roadway would be wide.\n\nPenker Construction of Cincinnati, Ohio, was awarded the bid to construct the new bridge. Of the 10 bidders, Penker's was the lowest bid at just under $1,821,250. Its contract required the bridge to be built within 400 calendar days after the old bridge is closed. It also required the new bridge to be constructed of pink granite. Penker also won a $23,000 contract to demolish the bridge.\n\nAbout March 5, 1939, a labor dispute halted work in the bridge. The jurisdictional strike occurred in a dispute over whether the steel workers or rod workers union would have the right to trim steel rods on the project. The dispute lasted nearly two weeks. Both unions agreed to return to work on March 19, pending a resolution of their dispute through arbitration.\n\nA second labor dispute halted work on the bridge when 200 members of Sand and Gravel Workers Union Local 22075 went out on strike over a refusal by the Smoot Sand and Gravel Corporation to adopt the closed shop. The strike, which began on August 14, immediately halted concrete work not only on the new Sousa Bridge but on more than 20 building and transportation infrastructure projects, and idled more than 5,000 workers. Howard T. Colvin, a United States Department of Labor conciliator, was called in to help end the dispute. Initially, Colvin expressed optimism that the strike could be settled swiftly. But the union rejected a potential settlement on August 23 because it lacked specific wage and hour agreements. On August 25, Representative William Alvin Pittenger (R-Minnesota) asked the Army Corps of Engineers to break the strike and supply sand and gravel itself. The Army refused. On August 28, the federal government intervened in the strike. Federal Works Agency Administrator John M. Carmody questioned why the single source was used to supply all the sand and gravel to so much projects, and threatened to find a new supplier if a settlement was not forthcoming. John R. Steelman, head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, announced he was personally intervening in the negotiations to bring an end to the strike. Meanwhile, Colvin proposed a strike settlement which was immediately accepted by the union and rejected by the company. Carmody and Steelman's intervention appeared to work. Progress in strike talks was announced on August 30, and on September 5 the company and union ended the strike after agreeing to Colvin's terms.\n\nAn appropriations request to finish the second span of the bridge was made to city commissioners in September 1939. On October 21, with the downstream span nearing completion, the Highway Engineering & Construction Co. of Washington, D.C., was given a $46,000 contract to pave the span. By the end of November, the downstream span was nearly complete.\n\nThe downstream span of the John Philip Sousa Bridge was opened on December 9, 1939, before a crowd of more than 12,000. Nine-year-old Nancy Lee, daughter of Adelbert Lee (president of the Randle Highlands Citizens Association and vice president of the Southeast Business Men's Association) cut the ribbon opening the bridge. Captain Whitehurst presented the bridge to the District Commissioners. Present for the dedication were Sousa's daughters, Jane Priscilla Sousa and Helen Sousa Abert, and Sousa's sister, 89-year-old Catherine Sousa Varela. The United States Marine Band provided the music for the event. Two Boy Scouts, George Durham and Jack Green, played \"Taps\" in the direction of nearby Congressional Cemetery (where Sousa was buried).\n\nThe old Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge span closed the same day as the dedication, and demolition of the span began a few days later.\n\nFull funding for the completion of the second span was included by the D.C. Commissioners in their federal budget submission for fiscal 1941. There was no dispute over the funding, and the appropriation was made.\n\nWork on the second span was temporarily interrupted in July 1940 when 250 workers at Smoot Sand & Gravel walked out to protest a job classification by the federal Wage and Hour Division. The men worked on barges dredging gravel, and wanted to be classified as seamen so they could qualify for overtime and work more than the federally approved 42-hour work week. The strike began on July 9, lasted five days, and idled more than 6,500 workers (including those working on the Social Security and Railroad Retirement Board buildings) as no concrete could be delivered. The men won reclassification as seamen, a 10 percent wage increase, and pay for five days they were idle.\n\nPlanning for the span's dedication began in October 1940. In mid-December, the downstream span was closed and traffic shifted onto the newly completed north span to allow the removal of the temporary division of the south span and its resurfacing. Construction delays, however, meant that the traffic diversion did not occur until January 2, 1941. On December 21, Captain Whitehurst announced that the Sousa Bridge would be completed on January 15, 1941.\n\nThe north span was formally dedicated in a small ceremony on January 18, 1941.\n\nWhen originally completed in 1941, the bridge connected to what was then called Ellicott Circle on the east bank of the Anacostia, but in 1957, the District began work on the Anacostia Freeway, a project that replaced the circle with a freeway interchange and new ramps to Anacostia Drive. Work on the Pennsylvania avenue interchange began in late November of 1961 and completed in May of 1964.\n\nWhen constructed, the Sousa Bridge connected with Barney Circle, a traffic circle that forms the terminus foot of Pennsylvania Avenue SE, Kentucky Avenue SE, 17th Street SE, and M Street SE. A streetcar turnaround and bus lane was carved from the center of the circle, and a $7,000 bus and streetcar terminal occupied the western portion of the site. The terminal opened on January 26, 1941.\n\nIn 1956, federal and regional transportation planners proposed an Inner Loop Expressway composed of three circumferential beltways for the District of Columbia. The middle beltway would have begun at the proposed Barney Circle Freeway near Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, until it terminated near 37th Street NW at the north end of Georgetown. \n\nFrom 1969 to 1974, the District rebuilt Barney Circle to accommodate the freeway. The turnaround loop and transit stop were removed and the circle dug out. What was to be the Southwest Freeway was built under the circle, with a curving ramp connecting the bridge to the freeway. When the circle was rebuilt, Pennsylvania Avenue was realigned to go straight across the circle. During construction, traffic was rerouted around the circle on a temporary scaffold-like viaduct. But before the project could be finished, the continuation of the freeway north was in trouble. \n\nTwo decades of protest led to the cancellation of all but the I-395 and I-695 portions of the plan, and the unbuilt portions of the project were finally cancelled in 1977. The failure to complete the Inner Loop left the Sousa Bridge's approaches incomplete and confusing. Unmarked Interstate 695 delivered three lanes of traffic to a one-lane on-ramp to the bridge, and traffic backed up for miles every day as a traffic light allowed only a few cars onto the bridge's southbound lanes during rush hour. An off-ramp delivered most northbound bridge traffic around the incomplete Barney Circle and under the bridge onto Interstate 695 westbound.\n\nUltimately, motorists wanting to access the Baltimore–Washington Parkway or U.S. Route 50 in Maryland (the John Hanson Highway) would often travel Interstate 695 to Barney Circle, wait at the traffic light there, cross the Sousa Bridge, wait at a traffic light on the southwestern terminus of the bridge, and make a left turn against oncoming traffic to access a narrow and dangerous ramp that led to northbound D.C. Route 295 (the Anacostia Freeway). The combination of traffic lights, left turn, and mixing of both through-traffic and local traffic created extensive traffic congestion on the Sousa Bridge during evening rush hour.\n\nIn 1975, federal, regional, and city transportation planners proposed an extension to I-695/Southeast Freeway to be called the \"Barney Circle Freeway\" to help alleviate the problems created by the failure to complete the Inner Loop. The freeway would extend I-695 past its existing terminus at Barney Circle and travel along the western bank of the Anacostia River (through Anacostia Park) to a new bridge over the Anacostia River at Burnham Barrier, providing vehicles easy access to the Anacostia Freeway. The Barney Circle Freeway would have delinked Barney Circle from I-695, and restricted the on- and off-ramps to Sousa Bridge so that the bridge returned to its traditional function as a local bridge rather than a route for commuters to access the Anacostia Freeway and points east in the state of Maryland. The combined bridge and freeway project was ready for construction to begin in 1981, and its cost was estimated to be $93.5 million. But after protests from residents of Capitol Hill (who feared the Barney Circle Freeway would cause more traffic to flow into the area) as well as environmentalists, and legal and regulatory challenges, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) officials agreed in August 1994 to conduct an additional environmental impact assessment regarding the project, but later said the assessment's findings did not alter its earlier conclusion that construction of the roadway and bridge project was economically feasible, technologically appropriate, and environmentally sound. However, the D.C. City Council had the final say on whether to proceed with the project or not. In December 1994, the City Council bowed to neighborhood opposition and voted overwhelmingly to reject the project.\n\nIn 2009, the District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT) began the replacement of the 11th Street Bridges just down the Anacostia River. It closed and decommissioned the segment of Interstate 695 from the 11th Street Bridges to Barney Circle by early 2013. These changes removed a significant portion of the traffic using Sousa Bridge, from 50,000 vehicles per day (each way) in 2004 to an estimated 35,000 vehicles per day (each way) in 2030. DDOT also redesigned and rebuilt the ramp from Pennsylvania Avenue SE to northbound D.C. Route 295 to improve its safety. Decommissioned Interstate 695 began to be transformed into a boulevard named \"Southeast Boulevard\", a four-lane grand boulevard with a landscaped median and pedestrian nature trail designed to link Barney Circle to 11th Street SE.\n\nFrom April 1994 to December 1995, the bridge was reconstructed and widened from to , which required the abutments to be widened too. It received a new surface, structural work and new bicycle and pedestrian access. The work strengthened the bridge, widened the lanes from to , widened the sidewalks to accommodate bicycles, created a barrier between the sidewalks and the roadway and added a median barrier.\n\nA 2013 DDOT inspection of the Sousa Bridge found it to be structurally sound but only in \"fair\" condition. However, two bridges on the Sousa Bridge's eastern end, carrying traffic from the bridge to D.C. Route 295 (passing over an access road in Anacostia Park), were found to be in serious disrepair in July 2014. DDOT subsequently budgeted money in fiscal 2016 to repair the bridges.\n\n"}

The western terminus of NH 27 is in Hooksett at U.S. Route 3 and New Hampshire Route 28 north of Manchester. The eastern terminus is in Hampton Beach at New Hampshire Route 1A, which runs along the New Hampshire coastline adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nNH 27 is a local highway which parallels the New Hampshire Route 101 expressway for its entire length. NH 27 serves the centers of many of the communities which NH 101 bypasses.\n\nRoute 27 starts at an intersection with U.S. Route 3 (Hooksett Road) and New Hampshire Route 28 in southern Hooksett. It proceeds east 1/4 mile and crosses New Hampshire 28 Bypass (Londonderry Turnpike), then continues northeast through Hooksett into Candia.\n\nRoute 27 intersects New Hampshire Route 43 at Candia Four Corners, then continues east and meets NH 107 in the northwest part of Raymond. Turning southeast, the highways run concurrently past the center of Raymond, with NH 107 splitting off to the south in the eastern part of the town. NH 27 continues east into the town of Epping, where it crosses New Hampshire Route 125 (Calef Highway), a major north-south two-lane highway in eastern New Hampshire. \n\nNH 27 then continues southeast through southern Epping and reaches northwest Exeter, where it interchanges with New Hampshire Route 101, the major east-west freeway for the region. NH 27 then enters the town center of Exeter, and briefly runs concurrently with New Hampshire Route 111A, before both routes meet NH 111, and NH 111A terminates at its parent. NH 111 and NH 27 run concurrently until separating in the southeast corner of Exeter, west of NH 111's interchange with NH 101. \n\nNH 27 continues southeast into Hampton, where it interchanges with NH 101 one last time, before entering Hampton's town center, where it intersects U.S. Route 1. NH 27 continues east, reaching its eastern terminus at NH 1A (Ocean Boulevard) at Hampton's North Beach along the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nNH 27 was formerly NH 101B from Hooksett to the intersection with NH 43 in Candia.\n\nThe section of NH 27 between NH 43 in Candia (the former eastern terminus of NH 101B) and the eastern terminus of the NH 27/New Hampshire Route 107 concurrency in Raymond is part of New Hampshire Route 101 Business, although this segment is not signed as such in the field. Originally, this section of NH 27 was a part of New Hampshire Route 101 until the NH 101 freeway was built in the 1980s.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the NH 101 expressway between exit 5 (NH 107) in Raymond and exit 9 near Exeter was completed, allowing NH 101 to shift from its surface alignment between Raymond and Exeter to the freeway. NH 27 was then extended eastward from Raymond along the former routing of NH 101 to NH 108 in Exeter. Additionally, the routing of NH 101C, which ran from NH 108 east along what is now NH 27 to NH 1A in Hampton Beach, was usurped by NH 27, extending NH 27 to its current location.\n\nThe NH 101C designation was changed in 1990 due to confusion between NH 101C, NH 101D in Exeter and North Hampton, and NH 101E in Hampton.

He was the grandson of Rufus King, delegate for Massachusetts to the Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention. The Kings were part of the King family of Massachusetts and New York. After graduation from Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School, King enrolled in the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1829 and graduated the fourth in his class. He was commissioned into the United States Corps of Engineers in 1833 but resigned in 1836 to become the New York and Erie Railroad civil engineer.\n\nAfter three years with the railroad, King decided to change his career path and became a newspaper editor. He worked at the \"Albany Daily Advertiser\" and the \"Albany Evening Journal\", which were published by Thurlow Weed, a leading figure in the New York's Whig Party. In 1839, King was appointed adjutant general of the New York State Militia by Governor William H. Seward, a political ally of Weed, and held this post until 1843.\n\nIn 1836, King married Ellen Eliot, who died two years into marriage; they had no children. After five years, King married her sister Susan Eliot, and they had two children. His son Rufus King Jr. became a Union Army officer of the U.S. Horse Artillery Brigade and was awarded the Medal of Honor; his other son, Charles King became a Brigadier General of Volunteers during the Spanish–American War and a writer of Western novels.\n\nIn 1845, he left New York and moved to the Wisconsin Territory, accomplishing a mixture of politics (member of the 1848 Wisconsin constitutional convention), journalism (editor and part owner of the \"Milwaukee Sentinel and Gazette\"), and education (superintendent of schools in Milwaukee in 1859-1860, and a regent of the University of Wisconsin in 1848-1854). King also organized and played in the first three baseball games played in the state of Wisconsin. The matches were played at the old State Fairgrounds (what is now the Marquette University campus) during the winter of 1859.\n\nKing was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln as Minister to the Papal States in 1861 after being recommended by the Secretary of State Seward. On his way to Rome when the Civil War broke out, he took a leave of absence to join the Union Army. He was appointed a brigadier general of the Wisconsin militia on April 15, 1861, and of U.S. Volunteers on May 17, and was given authorization to raise a Wisconsin regiment. King helped organize what came to be known as the famous Iron Brigade, the Second, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Wisconsin, and Nineteenth Indiana volunteers, which he commanded briefly.\n\nHowever, before the Iron Brigade saw combat, King was promoted on March 13, 1862 to command of a division (which included the Iron Brigade) in the I Corps of the Army of the Potomac replacing general Irvin McDowell. The Division's first action was in the in August 1862. On August 28, 1862, King received orders to advance on Warrenton Turnpike towards Centreville, Virginia. Later in the day, his division was attacked by Confederate forces under Stonewall Jackson's command. Suffering from epileptic seizures, King spent the battle in an ambulance wagon and turned over command of the division to Brig. Gen John P. Hatch, the ranking brigade commander. Hatch then led King's division at Second Bull Run and during the Maryland Campaign until being wounded at South Mountain. In December 1862, King served on the court-martial of Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter for disobedience and cowardice at Second Bull Run.\n\nKing performed garrison duty at Fort Monroe, Virginia, and was a military governor of Norfolk. His epileptic seizures became more frequent, and in October 1863, King resigned his commission, and succeeded Richard Milford Blatchford as Minister to the Papal States. He served until the end of 1867, and was instrumental in apprehending John Surratt in Rome.\n\nReturning to New York from Rome in 1868, King served for two years as deputy comptroller of customs for the Port of New York, but then retired on account of failing health. He quietly lived in retirement until he died in New York City in 1876. He is buried in Grace Churchyard, Jamaica, New York.\n\nRufus King International School – High School Campus, formerly Rufus King High School, in Milwaukee is named after him.

Organic materials in the liquid are catabolized by a microbial ecosystem. \n\nA septic drain field, a septic tank, and associated piping compose a septic system. \n\nThe drain field typically consists of an arrangement of trenches containing perforated pipes and porous material (often gravel) covered by a layer of soil to prevent animals (and surface runoff) from reaching the wastewater distributed within those trenches. Primary design considerations are both \"hydraulic\" for the volume of wastewater requiring disposal and \"catabolic\" for the long-term biochemical oxygen demand of that wastewater. The land area that is set aside for the septic drain field may be called a septic reserve area (SRA).\n\nSewage farms similarly dispose of wastewater through a series of ditches and lagoons (often with little or no pre-treatment). These are more often found in arid countries as the waterflow on the surface allows for irrigation (and fertilization) of agricultural land.\n\nMany health departments require a percolation test (\"perc\" test) to establish the suitability of drain field soil to receive septic tank effluent. An engineer, soil scientist, or licensed designer may be required to work with the local governing agency to design a system that conforms to these criteria.\n\nA more progressive way to determine leach field sizing is by direct observation of the soil profile. In this observation, the engineer evaluations many features of the soil such as texture, structure, consistency, pores/roots, etc.\n\nThe goal of percolation testing is to ensure the soil is permeable enough for septic tank effluent to percolate away from the drain field, but fine grained enough to filter out pathogenic bacteria and viruses before they travel far enough to reach a water well or surface water supply. Coarse soils – sand and gravel – can transmit wastewater away from the drain field before pathogens are destroyed. Silt and clay effectively filter out pathogens but allow very limited wastewater flow rates. Percolation tests measure the rate at which clean water disperses through a disposal trench into the soil. Several factors may reduce observed percolation rates when the drain field receives anoxic septic tank effluent:\n\n\nJust as a septic tank is sized to support a community of anaerobic organisms capable of liquefying anticipated amounts of putrescible materials in wastewater, a drain field should be sized to support a community of aerobic soil microorganisms capable of decomposing the anaerobic septic tank's effluent into aerobic water. Hydrogen sulfide odors or iron bacteria may be observed in nearby wells or surface waters when effluent has not been completely oxidized prior to reaching those areas. The biofilm on the walls of the drain field trenches will use atmospheric oxygen in the trenches to catabolize organic compounds in septic tank effluent. Groundwater flow is laminar in the aquifer soils surrounding the drain field. Septic tank effluent with soluble organic compounds passing through the biofilm forms a mounded lens atop the groundwater underlying the drain field. Molecular diffusion controls the mixing of soluble organic compounds into the groundwater and the transport of oxygen from underlying groundwater or the capillary fringe of the groundwater surface, to micro-organisms capable of catabolizing dissolved organic compounds remaining in the effluent plume.\n\nWhen a septic tank is used in combination with a biofilter, the height and catabolic area of the drain field may be reduced. Biofilter technology may allow higher density residential construction, minimal site disturbance and more usable land for trees, swimming pools, or gardens. With adequate routine maintenance it may reduce the chances of the drain field plugging up. The biofilter will not reduce the volume of liquid that must percolate into soil, but it may reduce the oxygen demand of organic materials in that liquid.\n\nA drain field may be designed to offer several separate disposal areas for effluent from a single septic tank. One area may be \"rested\" while effluent is routed to a different area. The nematode community in the resting drain field continues feeding on the accumulated biofilm and fats when the anaerobic septic tank effluent is no longer available. This natural cleansing process may reduce bioclogging to improve the hydraulic capacity of the field by increasing the available interstitial area of the soil as the accumulated organic material is oxidized. The percolation rate after resting may approach, but is unlikely to match, the original clean water percolation rate of the site.\n\nSeptic tank and drain field microorganisms have very limited capability for catabolizing petroleum products and chlorinated solvents, and cannot remove dissolved metals; although some may be absorbed into septic tank sludge or drain field soils, and concentrations may be diluted by other groundwater in the vicinity of the drain field. Cleaning formulations may reduce drain field efficiency. Laundry bleach may slow or stop microbial activity in the drain field, and sanitizing or deodorizing chemicals may have similar effects. Detergents, solvents and drain cleaners may transport emulsified, saponified or dissolved fats into the drain field before they can be catabolized into short-chain organic acids in the septic tank scum layer.\n\n"}

After retiring as a player, he spent 14 months as manager of AFC Bournemouth. After a seven-year spell as manager of National League club Havant & Waterlooville, he took charge of National League South side Eastbourne Borough in May 2019, but left in November 2019 and became assistant head coach at EFL League Two club Crawley Town.\n\nWhen he was an army recruit, Bradbury played part-time when on leave for Halstead Town under 18 side, and during the 1994-95 season Cowes Sports. Bradbury also played for Northern Irish side Fivemiletown United while stationed in Northern Ireland with the army. Bradbury started his professional career at Portsmouth, where he played for three years. A number of impressive performances in the 1996–97 season resulted in interest from a number of clubs, and in July 1997 he was purchased by Manchester City manager Frank Clark for a club record £3 million. However, Bradbury struggled to make an impact at Maine Road, and at the end of the 1997–98 season City were relegated, with Bradbury having scored just six goals.\n\nThree months into the following season Bradbury moved to Crystal Palace for £1.5 million. Less than a year later Bradbury was on the move again, returning to Portsmouth for £300,000.\n\nBradbury's career started to recover at Pompey, making more than 100 appearances in his second spell at the club. However, in the 2002–03 season Bradbury lost his first team place and was loaned out to Sheffield Wednesday. He returned from his loan spell to contribute three appearances and one goal (ironically against Sheffield Wednesday) to Portsmouth's title run-in as they won the First Division title and promotion to the Premier League. The following season he was loaned to Derby County before being sold to Walsall in March 2004 (where he scored once against former club Derby).\n\nAt the end of the 2004–05 season Bradbury was playing for Oxford United. Bradbury signed a four-month contract with Southend United on 31 January 2006. He subsequently signed a longer contract.\n\nIn August 2007, Bradbury signed for AFC Bournemouth on a four-month loan deal. After playing one game for the club the loan was made permanent, and Bradbury signed a contract until the end of the season.\n\nIn the later stages of Bradbury's career, he played in a much different role, being converted into a right back for Bournemouth during an injury crisis he became the first choice right back for the south coast club, but with the arrival of defender Stephen Purches, who returned after three seasons away from Bournemouth, Bradbury went back to his former role of striker whilst attacking options were limited.\n\nOn 15 January 2011, Bradbury was appointed as caretaker manager after the departure of Eddie Howe to Burnley. The next day, he announced his retirement from playing, and on 28 January, was given a two-and-a-half-year deal as permanent manager of the club. In January 2012, Bradbury signed an improved three-and-a-half-year contract to manage the League One club, keeping him at Bournemouth until the summer of 2015. During his first season at the helm, Bradbury steered the Cherries into the League One Play-offs, eventually losing to Huddersfield on penalties. On 25 March, during his second season, Bradbury was dismissed from Bournemouth following the club's run of poor form.\n\nBradbury was appointed manager of Conference South club Havant & Waterlooville on 9 October 2012. At the time, Bradbury was coaching the Under-14s at Portsmouth's Academy set up In his first game as manager, his side won 2–1 against Basingstoke Town on 13 October 2012. Following Michael Appleton's departure to become manager at Blackpool, Bradbury was linked with a return to Portsmouth, however Guy Whittingham was appointed instead. On 30 April 2016, Havant & Waterlooville's relegation from the National League South was confirmed.\nA whole season in The Isthmian league followed (Havant and Waterlooville being favourites to get promoted), and promotion was achieved on the last day of the season on 22 April 2017. Bradbury earned the 'Manager of the year' award for winning the league. Hawks played the 2017-18 season back in the National League South and won it at the first attempt, gaining promotion to the National League Premier Division.\n\nBradbury moved to Eastbourne Borough in May 2019, and managed the National League South club until November of that year. In December 2019 he was appointed assistant head coach of Crawley Town in League Two, alongside newly appointed head coach John Yems.\n\nLee Bradbury spent time in the army before entering the world of football.

She was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria through her father. Her 1913 wedding to Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover was the largest gathering of reigning monarchs in Germany since German unification in 1871, and one of the last great social events of European royalty before the First World War began fourteen months later.\n\nShortly after the wedding, she became the Duchess of Brunswick by marriage. Through her daughter Frederica, Princess Victoria Louise was the maternal grandmother of Queen Sophia of Spain (mother of Felipe VI of Spain) and the former King Constantine II of Greece.\n\nPrincess Victoria Louise was born on 13 September 1892, the seventh child and only daughter of German Emperor Wilhelm II and Empress Augusta Victoria. \"After six sons, God has given us our seventh child, a small but very strong little daughter,\" the empress wrote in her diary soon after the birth. The young princess was christened on 22 October, and was named after her paternal great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, and her paternal great great grandmother, Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Known officially as Victoria Louise, she was nicknamed \"Sissy\" by her family.\n\nHistorian Justin C. Vovk writes that Victoria Louise was intelligent like her paternal grandmother Empress Frederick, stately and dignified like her mother, but imperious and willful like her father. She enjoyed being the center of attention, and was her father's favourite. According to her eldest brother Crown Prince Wilhelm, Victoria Louise was \"the only one of us who succeeded in her childhood in gaining a snug place\" in their father's heart. In 1902, her English governess, Anne Topham, observed in their first meeting that the nine-year-old princess was friendly, energetic, and always quarreling with her next eldest brother, Prince Joachim. Anne later noted that the \"warlike\" emperor \"unbends to a considerable extent when in the bosom of his family,\" and is the \"dominating force of his daughter's life. His ideas, his opinions on men and things are persistently quoted by her.\"\n\nThe family resided at Homburg Castle, and Victoria Louise and Joachim would often visit their cousins – the children of the Prussian princesses Margaret and Sophia – at nearby Kronberg Castle. In 1905, the princess studied music with concert pianist Sandra Drouker. For a period of one week in May 1911, Victoria Louise traveled to England aboard the \"Hohenzollern\" with her parents, where they visited their cousin King George V for the unveiling of a statue of Queen Victoria in front of Buckingham Palace. Her confirmation took place at Friedenskirche in Potsdam on 18 October 1909.\n\nIn 1912, Ernest Augustus, the wealthy heir to the title of Duke of Cumberland, came to the Berlin court to thank Emperor Wilhelm for having Crown Prince Wilhelm and Prince Eitel Friedrich attend the funeral of his brother, Prince George William. At the time, the House of Hanover lived in exile at Gmunden, Austria. While in Berlin, Ernest Augustus met Victoria Louise, and the two became smitten with each other. However, any discussions of marriage were prolonged for months due to political concerns; Ernest Augustus was also the heir to the Kingdom of Hanover, which had been annexed into the Kingdom of Prussia following the 1866 Austro-Prussian War. The Prussian crown prince was displeased with the match and wished that Ernest Augustus abdicate his rights to Hanover; in a compromise, it was decided that in exchange, he would succeed to the smaller duchy of Brunswick, of which his father was the lawful heir. The family had been barred from the succession to Brunswick due to their claims towards the Hanoverian kingdom. \n\nErnest and Victoria were engaged in Karlsruhe on 11 February 1913. Their wedding, an extravagant affair, took place on 24 May 1913 in Berlin. It was hailed in the press as the end of the rift between the House of Hanover and House of Hohenzollern that had existed since the 1866 annexation. \"The Times\" described the union as akin to \"Romeo and Juliet\", albeit with a happier ending. Despite press fixation on the union as a love match, it remains unclear if the match was one of love or politics; historian Eva Giloi believes that the marriage was more likely the result of Prussia's desire to end the rift, though in one of Victoria Louise's letters she described it as a \"love match\".\n\nIn a diplomatic gesture, Emperor Wilhelm invited almost all of his extended family. Also two imprisoned British spies Captain Stewart and Captain Trench, were pardoned and released by the Kaiser as a present to the United Kingdom. The wedding became the largest gathering of reigning monarchs in Germany since German unification in 1871, and one of the last great social events of European royalty before World War I began fourteen months later. Attendees included Wilhelm's cousins King George V and Tsar Nicholas II. The wedding feast included 1,200 guests. Empress Augusta Victoria took the separation from her only daughter badly and wept.\n\nThe new duke and duchess of Brunswick moved into Brunswick Palace in the capital of Brunswick and began their family with the birth of their eldest son, Prince Ernest Augustus, less than a year after their wedding. They had four further children: Prince George William (b. 1915), Princess Frederica (b. 1917), Prince Christian Oscar (b. 1919), and Prince Welf Henry (b. 1923).\n\nOn 8 November 1918, her husband was forced to abdicate his throne along with the other German kings, grand dukes, dukes, and princes, and the duchy of Brunswick was subsequently abolished. The next year, he was deprived of his British peerages under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917 as a result of his service in the German army during the war.\n\nThus, when his father died in 1923, Ernest Augustus did not succeed to his father's British title of Duke of Cumberland. For the next thirty years, Ernest Augustus remained the head of the House of Hanover, living in retirement on his various estates with his family, mainly Blankenburg Castle in Germany and Cumberland Castle in Gmunden, Austria. He also owned Marienburg Castle near Hanover, however rarely ever lived there until 1945.\nSeveral of Victoria Louise's brothers were early members of the Nazi party, including former Crown Prince Wilhelm and Prince August Wilhelm. While Ernest Augustus never officially joined the party, he donated funds and was close to several leaders. As a former British prince, Ernest Augustus as well as Victoria Louise desired a \"rapprochement\" between England and Germany. Ostensibly desiring to pursue an alliance with the UK, in the mid-1930s, Adolf Hitler took advantage of their sentiment by asking the couple to arrange a match between their daughter Princess Frederica and the Prince of Wales. The Duke and Duchess of Brunswick refused, believing that the age difference was too great. After his abdication in 1936, Edward VIII and his wife visited \"the Cumberlands\" at Cumberland Castle in Gmunden, Austria. In 1938 princess Frederica married the later king Paul of Greece.\n\nIn May 1941, her father fell ill from an intestinal blockage, and Victoria Louise traveled to Doorn to visit him, as did several of her brothers. Wilhelm recovered enough for them to depart, but soon relapsed. Victoria Louise returned in time to be at her father's bedside, along with nephew Louis Ferdinand and stepmother Hermine, when he died on 4 June 1941 of a pulmonary embolism. By the time of the war's ending in Europe in April 1945, Victoria Louise was living with her husband at Blankenburg Castle. A few days before Blankenburg was handed over to the Red Army by British and U.S. forces in late 1945, to become part of East Germany, the family was able to move to Marienburg Castle, at the time located in the British Occupation Zone, with all their furniture, transported by British Army trucks, on the order of .\n\nAfter the war, Victoria Louise spent much of her time attending public events in Lower Saxony, supporting palace restoration projects, high-society parties, hunting, and the showing of horses. She also spent time helping with philanthropic causes, for instance supporting a holiday estate for low-income children. Her husband died at Marienburg on 30 January 1953. When her eldest son made Marienburg a museum in 1954 and moved himself to Calenberg Estate nearby, she became at odds with him, although he had offered her several other manor houses to move in. There was also a rivalry between them about her popularity and public appearances. Instead, she moved back to Brunswick, occupying a house which had been offered to her by a wealthy industrialist and a circle of fans called \"Braunschweiger Freundeskreis\" (circle of Brunswick friends). She lived there until her death. \n\nIn 1965 she published her autobiography \"Life as Daughter of the Emperor\", and thereafter several other books, including biographies on her mother and on her sister-in-law Cecilie, the last crown princess of Germany. It is however believed that her publisher Leonhard Schlüter served as her ghostwriter. \n\nShe is buried next to her husband in front of the Royal Mausoleum in the Berggarten at Herrenhausen Gardens in Hanover, which is the burial chapel of Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover, and his wife and, since his reburial after World War II, also of George I of Great Britain.\n\nApproximate translations of the titles into English are given in parentheses.\n\n\nDavid Jones records in his prose-poem \"In Parenthesis\" a fragment of song from the Western Front\"I want Big Willie's luv-ly daughter\"implying (as Jones notes) \"that the object of the British Expedition into France was to enjoy the charms of the Emperor's daughter\".\n\nNamed for the princess:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2006272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006272", "title": "Workfare", "text": "Workfare\n\nWorkfare is an alternative, and controversial, way of providing money to otherwise unemployed or underemployed people, who are applying for social benefits. The term was first introduced by civil rights leader James Charles Evers in 1968; however, it was popularized by Richard Nixon in a televised speech August 1969. An early model of workfare had been pioneered in 1961 by Joseph Mitchell in Newburgh, New York.\n\nTraditional welfare benefits systems are usually awarded based on certain conditions, such as searching for work, or based on meeting criteria that would position the recipient as unavailable to seek employment or be employed. Under workfare, recipients have to meet certain participation requirements to continue to receive their welfare benefits. These requirements are often a combination of activities that are intended to improve the recipient's job prospects (such as training, rehabilitation, and work experience) and those designated as contributing to society (such as unpaid or low-paid work). These programs, now common in Australia (as \"mutual obligation\"), Canada, and the United Kingdom, have generated considerable debate and controversy. In the Netherlands workfare is known as Work First, based on the Wisconsin Works program from the United States.\n\nThere are two main types of workfare scheme: those that encourage direct employment to get individuals off the welfare roll and directly into the workforce, and those that are intended to increase human capital by providing training and education to those currently in the welfare system.\n\nIn less developed countries, similar schemes are designed to alleviate rural poverty among day-labourers by providing state-subsidised temporary work during those periods of the year when little agricultural work is available. For example, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) in India offers 100 days' paid employment per year for those eligible, rather than unemployment benefits on the Western model. However, a workfare model typically not only focuses on provision of social protection through a wage-income transfer, but also supports workers to get into work.\n\nThe purported main goal of workfare is to generate a \"net contribution\" to society from welfare recipients. Most commonly, it means getting unemployed people into paid work, reducing or eliminating welfare payments to them and creating an income that generates taxes. Workfare participants may retain certain employee rights throughout the process, however, often workfare programs are determined to be \"outside employment relationships\" and therefore the rights of beneficiaries can be different. \n\nSome workfare systems also aim to derive a contribution from welfare recipients by more direct means. Such systems obligate unemployed people to undertake work that is considered beneficial to their community.\n\nWorkfare schemes in the UK are controversial. In the US, critics point out that the type of work offered by workfare providers is generally unskilled and is comparable to community work carried out by criminal offenders being punished on community service schemes. Many charities and workers' unions have criticized workfare schemes for undermining the work done by actual charity volunteers, and acting as a threat to low paid unskilled workers.\n\nIn Australia, the Work for the Dole schemes have been linked to the concepts of “mutual obligation” and \"compliance\". Their effectiveness has been questioned by researchers.\n\nIn 2007, Singapore introduced a similar program.\n\n\n\n"}

The band first backed The Chosen Few in the early 1970s before joining with successful solo artist Jacob Miller and releasing a string of records. This era of the band ended with Miller's death in a car crash in 1980.\n\nThe group reformed in 1986. During this period, they released several international hit singles, including \"Sweat (A La La La La Long)\" and \"Bad Boys\", the theme from the US television show \"Cops\". The group continued to record and tour thereafter.\n\nBrothers Ian and Roger Lewis have remained the group's consistent members, playing bass and guitar, respectively. Other long-term members include keyboardist Bernard \"Touter\" Harvey, a member since 1973, and drummer Lancelot Hall, who joined during their 1986 reformation. The band's lineup is completed by singer Trevor \"Skatta\" Bonnick and lead guitarist Andre Philips.\n\nInner Circle was formed in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1968, by the brothers Ian Lewis and Roger Lewis with then 12-year-old Stephen \"Cat\" Coore and Michael Cooper. They appeared on record in 1970, backing The Chosen Few on the Derrick Harriott-produced single \"Why Can't I Touch You\", with the Inner Circle Band credited with the instrumental version on the B-side. This was one of several singles on which they backed the Chosen Few. In 1970 the band was expanded when they were joined by drummer William Stewart, percussionist Irvin \"Carrot\" Jarrett, and singer William \"Bunny Rugs\" Clarke. The band played on Eric Donaldson's hit single \"Cherry Oh Baby\" and recorded their own version as \"Red Cherry\".\n\nJarrett left the band in 1972, with singer Clarke leaving the following year when he moved to New York. Clarke's replacement was Milton \"Prilly\" Hamilton, but this line-up was short-lived as the band split in two with Coore, Cooper, and Hamilton leaving to form Third World in 1973. Coore and Cooper were then students of the University of the West Indies, studying for various degrees and were soon joined in Third World by fellow Inner Circle departees Clarke and Jarrett. Meanwhile, Inner Circle re-tooled the lineup by recruiting keyboard players Charles Farquharson and Bernard Harvey (aka \"Touter\"), as well as drummer Calvin McKenzie as a replacement for Stewart (who would also go on to play with Third World). The band played the hotel and club circuit in Kingston, playing a mixture of reggae, pop and soul hits, and released their first album, \"Dread Reggae Hits\", in 1973 on Ian Lewis's Top Ranking label.\n\nAfter recording with singer Funky Brown, they recruited Jacob Miller as a permanent vocalist (although he continued to record as a solo artist), and had a hit single with a version of The Stylistics' \"You Make Me Feel Brand New\". Some of Miller's work with the band was credited to Miller alone, including the \"Tenement Yard\" single. The band were signed by Capitol Records, who issued the albums \"Reggae Thing\" (1976) and \"Ready for the World\" (1977). They toured the United States with American guitarist, Ed Elizalde. In 1978 they moved on to Island Records who released the \"Everything Is Great\" album in 1978, which included the UK hit singles \"Everything Is Great\" and \"Stop Breaking My Heart\", and \"New Age Music\" the following year. The band was joined by New York session guitarist Joe Ortiz, dubbed 'Gitzy' by the band; who added the first touches of hard rock, jazz, and blues to the group and to Reggae in general. Ortiz recorded at Compass Point Studios for the \"Everything Is Great\" album on Island Records, and later joined the group for their European tour in 1978–1980. He was also lead guitarist on the title track 'New Age Music' on the album of the same name. Lester Adderley joined the group for the \"New Age Music\" album on guitar. Also released in the late 1970s were two dub albums based on Miller's solo albums \"Killer Miller\" and \"Wanted\" but credited to Inner Circle. The band gained further exposure via their performance in the film \"Rockers\", playing a hotel house band. At his peak in the 1970s, only Bob Marley was more popular in Jamaica than Miller, and as a live act nobody equaled their popularity.\n\nMiller's death in a car crash on 23 March 1980 led the band to split up, with the Lewis Brothers and Touter Harvey moving to Miami, where they opened a studio in a warehouse, later opening their own Circle House recording studio, and the band has been based in Miami since then. After Miller's death in 1980, the band had one more American tour, inviting Norman Grant from the Twinkle Brothers for vocals.\n\nIn 1981, with Bay Area lead guitarist, Mark Castro, they recorded the album \"Something So Good\". Due to the loss of Jacob Miller, the members asked Mark Castro to help them find a new vocalist. Mark brought Rick Hunt to the band. \"Something So Good\" includes the memorable signature lead guitar solos that only Mark Castro can produce, especially When a Man Loves a Woman and World 2000.\"Something So Good\" was released in 1982. They reformed in 1986 with the Lewis Brothers and Harvey joined by singer Calton Coffie and drummer Lancelot Hall, and this line-up released the \"Black Roses\" album (released in 1986 on RAS Records). The band's next album, \"One Way\" in 1987, included one of their biggest hits, \"Bad Boys\", which was re-recorded for their 1989 album \"Identified\" and became the theme music for the Fox TV series \"Cops\" that year. California guitarist Dave Gonzales, by Mark Castro's recommendation, joined the band for a tour in 1989. \"Bad Boys\" was reissued as a single in 1990 and charted in several countries in Europe, but it was its 1993 re-release in the United States that achieved the greatest success. The 1992 album \"Bad to the Bone\" was picked up by Atlantic Records and reissued as \"Bad Boys\" in 1993 to capitalize on the success of the single. It sold more than half a million copies in the United States and more than four million worldwide. The band received a Grammy Award in 1993 for 'Best Reggae Album by Duo or Group' for \"Bad Boys\" and the album also spawned the international hit single \"Sweat (A La La La La Long)\", which was a #3 hit in the UK Singles Chart and topped the chart in 10 countries, selling over a million copies in Europe, while \"Bad Boys\" peaked at #52. It was their second (and last) American hit, reaching #16 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"Bad Boys\" was used in the 1995 film of the same name starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence and its sequels \"Bad Boys II\" and \"Bad Boys for Life\", and a ringtone based on the song was on the \"Billboard\" Hot Ringtones Chart for over 110 weeks. They received a second Grammy nomination in 1994 for the album \"Reggae Dancer\", which included a cover of Joe South's \"Games People Play\" which was released as a single.\n\nCoffie left in the mid-1990s to pursue a solo career, and they were joined in 1994 by Kris Bentley who made his album debut on \"Da Bomb\" (1997), released on the band's own Soundbwoy Entertainment label. In 1999 they released the album \"Jamaika Me Crazy\" on their own Eureka label. The 2000 album \"Big Tings\" featured guest appearances from Mr Vegas, Beenie Man, Luciano, Anthony B, and Glen Washington. In 2008, Jr. Jazz took over as lead vocalist.\n\nAs well as running the Circle Sound studio, the band members also run the Circle Sound production company.\n\nThe band's 2009 album \"State of Da World\" featured contributions from an array of reggae stars including Luciano, Damian Marley, Stephen Marley, Junior Reid, Mutabaruka, Bushman, David Hinds of Steel Pulse, and members of Slightly Stoopid.\n\nIn 2012, the band launched the 'Saving The Reggae Music' campaign with the aim of promoting traditional reggae music over the increasingly US-influenced music coming out of Jamaica.\n\nThe band's 2012 album \"Dubets\" featured collaborations with Peetah Morgan, Ken Boothe, Marcia Griffiths, Glen Washington, Ali Campbell of UB40, Gramps Morgan, A.J. Brown, and Marty Dread. The group went on to record with several younger singers and deejays, including Damian Marley, I-Octane, Khago, and Chronixx, with whom they recorded an updated version of \"Tenement Yard\".\n\nIn 2019 it was announced that Ian and Roger Lewis, and Jacob Miller would receive the Order of Distinction from the Jamaican government.\n\n\n"}

Previously he was Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court of Hungary from 1990 to 1998.\n\nHe was born in the southern Hungarian city of Pécs. He graduated in law from the University of Pécs in 1965. He worked as a professor at universities and law institutes in Budapest: at the Eötvös Loránd University from 1983, at Péter Pázmány Catholic University from 1996, and at Andrássy Gyula German Language University of Budapest from 2002. He also worked in Jena, Germany for 3 years.\n\nHis political career began as legal advisor for civil and environmental organisations in the late 1980s. As a founder of Danube Circle, he also had a significant role in environmental protection issues like preventing the construction of the Gabčíkovo - Nagymaros Dams which, according to the Danube Circle, would have damaged the habitat of a northern part of the Danube. He was one of the founders of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) in 1987, and represented that party in the Opposition Roundtable negotiations that played a very important part in Hungary's transition to parliamentary democracy. In 1989, for a short time he was member of the executive committee of the MDF.\n\nHowever, he left party politics in late 1989, as he was elected into the Constitutional Court of Hungary. He gained the presidency of the court half year later, and held that position until 1998. During this time, the Constitutional Court had a very important role in laying the groundwork for and strengthening democracy in Hungary. In this role, he significantly contributed to the removal of capital punishment, the protection of information rights, the freedom of opinion and of conscience, as well as the constitutional protection of domestic partnerships of homosexuals, which measures brought wide international acclaim for the Constitutional Court of Hungary.\n\nHe had a controversial principle of \"activism\" based on the \"invisible constitution\", motivating the decisions of the Court by the 'spirit' or 'morals' of the Constitution rather than its explicitly written form, advocating the principle of equality even over the letters of the constitution.\n\nAfter the end of his nine-year-long mandate, he continued his scholarly career, continued giving lectures in universities, and became founder of Védegylet, an environmentalist and civil rights non-governmental organisation in 2000.

As the Constitution of Hungary specifies, the President is elected by the Parliament of Hungary, so he had to acquire the support of Parliamentary parties. The opposition parties, Fidesz and Hungarian Democratic Forum, also endorsed him to become President of Hungary. However, if the governing parties had been united in support of the Hungarian Socialist Party candidate, Katalin Szili, Sólyom would not have secured enough votes to take the Presidency; but because Szili was not acceptable to the Alliance of Free Democrats, the smaller party in the governing coalition, they abstained from voting, and Sólyom's election was secured.\n\n\n5 August László Sólyom was inaugurated in his office at a ceremony in the Mirror Hall of Sándor Palace.\n\n20 August In his first ceremonial speech he formulated that “Let us be aware that we are a medium-sized country among the EU Member States, and we, too, are contributing to shaping whatever is to happen and what could happen in the European Union.” (full text)\n\n8 December In his toast at the gala-dinner offered by Ivan Ğašparovič, President of the Slovak Republic, László Sólyom underlined that \"The peoples' memory keeps the offences through generations and to avoid that these become prejudice and in order to ease them it is necessary to set them on the agenda to clear comprehensive historical processes and inherences, to eliminate taboo subjects and to show mutual empathy.\" (full text)\n\n27 January In his address on the Memorial Day of the Holocaust he said that “The absolute breaking of law that happened is confirming the law not only for the people which suffered of it but for the whole unity of mankind.

The incident happened while presenting an award to Fekete that the Gyurcsány cabinet forced through, despite strong objections to that nomination due to Fekete's past as a hardline communist.\n\nIn 2007, he refused to award a similar distinction to Gyula Horn. He referred to the fact that Horn had not changed his views on the 1956 revolution in which he had taken part on the Soviet side, fighting against the Hungarian revolutionaries. Sólyom said that this (i.e., Horn's opinion) conflicts with the constitutional values of the Republic of Hungary, and that he could not give the award to Horn, despite his merits.\n\nIn 2009, Sólyom was refused entry to Slovakia to attend the dedication of a statue of King Saint Stephen in the border town of Komárno on 21 August, an incident reported in Hungary as tantamount to a declaration of persona non grata which further worsened already tense Hungary–Slovakia relations. Sólyom said that \"this is a situation unheard of, inexcusable and unexplainable in the relationship of two allied countries.\" Slovakia's government, containing the ultranationalist SNS party, claimed that the Hungarian President's presence is a \"threat to national security\". Sólyom came back to visit the same statue a year later in August 2010, after Slovak voters ousted the previous government; the ceremony at the statue took place without incident.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2006307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006307", "title": "Night Heat", "text": "Night Heat\n\nNight Heat is a Canadian police crime drama series that aired on both CTV in Canada and CBS in the United States. Original episodes were broadcast from 1985 to 1989. \"Night Heat\" was the first Canadian original drama series that was also aired on a United States television network during its original broadcast. It was also the first original, first-run drama series to be aired during a late night time slot on a television network in the United States.\n\nDuring its original run it was the highest-rated Canadian-produced original series in Canada. The show won the Gemini Award for Best Drama Series in both 1986 and 1987.\nThe show stars Scott Hylands and Jeff Wincott as police detectives Kevin O'Brien and Frank Giambone who work the graveyard shift in an unnamed northeastern North American metropolis. The series follows their nightly police beat as it is chronicled by journalist Tom Kirkwood (Allan Royal) in his newspaper column titled \"Night Heat\".\n\nAllan Royal plays Tom Kirkwood, a journalist who writes a newspaper column titled \"Night Heat\" where he chronicles the nightly police beat of detectives Kevin O'Brien, played by Scott Hylands, and Frank Giambrone, played by Jeff Wincott. O'Brien is a tough, cynical, veteran police officer and Giambrone is his younger, hot-tempered partner. Kirkwood also serves as the show's narrator; his voice-over commentary starts and ends each episode, recapping the lessons learned and acting as a sort of Greek chorus.\n\nThe name of the city in which the show takes place is never mentioned. Each episode represents a single night's shift and, as a result, crimes often remain unresolved by the end of the show.\n\n\n\n\"Night Heat\" was conceived by Sonny Grosso, a former New York City Police Department detective. Grosso served was the show's executive producer along with his partner, Larry Jacobson.\n\nGrosso had over 20 years experience in law enforcement, later working as a narcotics detective. He and his former NYPD partner, Eddie Egan, were the detectives responsible for bringing an end to the infamous drug smuggling ring known as the French Connection. Grosso served as technical adviser on the film based on the investigation. He also worked as a consultant for the film \"The Godfather\" and as story editor for the TV series \"The Rockford Files\", \"Kojak\" and \"Baretta\".\n\nGrosso and Jacobson were originally approached by CBS to produce a docudrama series following actual police officers, but they considered the potential risk in filming people who had not yet been convicted of a crime and decided against it. Grosso came up with the idea of creating a police series that would feature a realistic look at police work in a documentary style, similar to the 1950s/1960s police drama \"Naked City\". He wanted to depict the life of the everyday police officer, in contrast to the slicker, high-action, high-drama, yuppie-oriented police series of the time such as \"Miami Vice\" and \"Hill Street Blues\". The pilot episode was written by Don Flynn, a crime reporter with the \"New York Daily News\".\n\nGrosso and Jacobson decided to produce their show in Toronto, Canada, as otherwise the production costs would have been too expensive for CBS's late-night budget. At the time one could film in Toronto for less than half the cost of a major American city—Canadian union scale was lower and the American-to-Canadian dollar exchange rate was also favorable. The show featured an all-Canadian cast and crew and was partially funded by the Government of Canada. For Hylands, a 21-year veteran actor, frequently seen playing villains in U.S. TV shows during the 1970s and early 1980s, this was the first time he had been given a leading role, or the role of a \"good guy.\" \n\nThe series was shot entirely at night between the hours of 6pm and 4am, which also made it easier to film since there was less traffic and it was easier to close down streets. The lower budget also meant that the show did not contain high speed car chases or shootouts with heavy calibre weapons. As a result, the show was more reliant on story and dialogue to capture audiences.\n\n\"Night Heat\" was filmed on 16mm film using hand-held cameras, instead of the Hollywood-standard 35mm film, giving the series a grainy, documentary-style look. Much of the show was shot at the site of the former Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital, which served as the series' police station; described as a \"grim and forbidding setting,\" the hospital fit in with the gritty look that the show's producer, Robert Lantos wanted.\n\nFilming a police drama aimed at both Canadian and American audiences in an unidentified city presented a unique set of challenges: The crew had to avoid capturing shots of landmarks and other objects that would give away that it was not an American city, such as Toronto Police cars, Esso stations and the CN Tower. While much of the show's dialogue included American law-enforcement terminology (for example: they referred to police \"precincts\" instead of \"divisions\", and characters had ranks such as officers, detectives and lieutenants instead of constables, sergeants and inspectors), they avoided terms from the American criminal justice system such as \"grand jury\" or \"district attorney\". In addition, the officers were never seen reading Miranda rights to suspects since there is no Miranda law in Canada. The writers also made a concerted effort to avoid using words that Canadians have a distinctive way of pronouncing, such as the words \"out\" and \"about\". Given Toronto's relative cleanliness when compared to larger American cities, the film crew would sometimes throw additional garbage onto the set during street scenes. Grosso, Hylands and Jacobson have all said in separate interviews that there was a time when the garbage that they had strewn about for a \"Night Heat\" shoot had been cleaned-up by city sanitation crews while the film crew was on break.\n\nCBS aired \"Night Heat\" as part of \"CBS Late Night\", a late-night block of drama programming. It marked the first time in 20 years that CBS had slotted a first-run series against \"The Tonight Show\". For six weeks in the summer of 1987 CBS moved the show to a 9pm slot, making it the first time that a Canadian drama series was shown on a major US network in prime time since \"Encounter\", a short-lived ABC anthology series broadcast live out of the CBC's Toronto studios in the fall of 1958.\n\nIn late 1988, CBS announced it had officially canceled \"Night Heat\". In spite of the show's popularity, CBS decided that it could get even better ratings in the late-night timeslot with \"The Pat Sajak Show\", a talk show fronted by \"Wheel of Fortune\" host Pat Sajak. Over a fourth of CBS's affiliates expressed more interest in running the Sajak program than continuing to run \"Night Heat\" and the last episode aired on CBS in January 1989 even though CTV still had a full season on film that had yet to be aired.\n\nAfter the series was canceled, reruns continued to air on CBS for another two years, and on Canadian television well into the early 2000s.\n\n\"Night Heat\" received good ratings for CBS; the show drew an average of 20% of TV viewers in its timeslot and at times the show even outperformed NBC's \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" in such markets as New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago.\n\nIn Canada \"Night Heat\" attracted a million viewers a week. Critics in Canada were generally enthusiastic about \"Night Heat\" and were proud of the fact that it was being shown on American television. Critics such as Rick Salutin of \"The Globe and Mail\" expressed disappointment that the show hid or downplayed the fact that it was Canadian in order to appeal to US audiences: \"they never say it's Toronto. It's just \"the city.\"\"\n\n\"Night Heat\" won the award for Best Drama Series at the 1986 Gemini Awards. At the 1987 Gemini Awards the series again won the award for Best Drama Series, actor Eugene Clark won the award for Best Performance by a Supporting Actor and writer Bob Carney won the award for Best Writing in a Dramatic Series for the episode titled \"The Hit\". \"Night Heat\" also won the 1987 Gemini award in the category of TV Guide's Most Popular Program, an award based on ballots submitted by the magazine's readers in Canada.\n\nAt the 1988 Gemini Awards writers Tim Dunphy and Peter Mohan won the award for Best Writing in a Dramatic Series and \"Night Heat\" again won TV Guide's Most Popular Program award. In 1989 the series writer Chris Haddock won the Gemini Award for Best Writing in a Dramatic Series for the episode titled \"False Witness\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2006314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006314", "title": "Mission Australia", "text": "Mission Australia\n\nMission Australia is a national Christian charity that provides a range of community services throughout Australia. In 2017–18, Mission Australia employed approximately 2800 staff and 1750 volunteers, and supported more than 119,000 children, young people, adults and elderly people across 461 programs and services. The organisation specialises in the areas of homelessness and housing, families and children, early learning, youth, employment and skills, alcohol and other drugs, disability, mental health, and strengthening communities. James Toomey became CEO in November 2017, succeeding Catherine Yeomans, who served as CEO from March 2014.\n\nMission Australia traces its origins back to 1859 to the Brisbane Town and Country Mission, which operated at a grassroots level to respond to need within the community. At this time in Australian history the needs were great, with many people struggling to stay fed, clothed and housed. \n\nOn 11 July 1862, Englishman Benjamin Short established the Sydney City Mission, desiring to address the spiritual and physical needs of the city’s inhabitants who were living in poverty.\n\nIn a public meeting, Short presented his vision for Sydney City Mission:\n\n\"“Christian friends, we have called you together because we desire to submit for your serious consideration the question, ‘Is it not desirable that there be established in Sydney a City Mission, somewhat similar in character to the London City Mission?’ … We feel that something must be done, and that the Christian Churches of Sydney cannot be held guiltless if they neglect to stretch out a helping hand to rescue those who are perishing around them.”\" Short gained the support of many prominent citizens, including the likes of John Fairfax, and clergymen of almost every denomination. The motto ‘Need, Not Creed’ emerged, with those present agreeing that a city as diverse as Sydney required a non-denominational City Mission.\n\nFour missionaries were appointed in 1862 (two men and two women), with their main tasks including home visits, distributing Bibles, persuading alcoholics to turn sober, and encouraging parents to send their children to school and Sunday School.\n\nAdelaide City Mission followed soon after in 1867 with a similar goal of addressing spiritual and physical need among the poor and disadvantaged in the city.\n\nFor decades these and other missions met immediate needs, giving out food and clothing. As no government welfare or unemployment benefits existed, City Missions saved many families from starvation.\n\nDuring the recession of 1890 and the Great Depression of the 1930s, Mission halls overflowed with people in need. By the middle of the 20 century, the City Missions recognised the importance of finding long-term solutions to disadvantage.\n\nIn 1974 Perth City Mission, then known as Jesus People Welfare Services, was founded.\n\nIn 1989 Wollongong City Mission and Wagga Wagga City Mission were founded.\n\nIn 1991, Hunter Mission was established, building on community service programs provided by Mayfield Baptist Church.\n\nIn 1996, Mission Australia officially formed, bringing together Adelaide City Mission, Hunter Mission, Perth City Mission, Sydney City Mission, Wagga Wagga City Mission and Wollongong City Mission. Brisbane City Mission joined soon after in 1998.\n\nIn 2000, Mission Australia’s Northern Territory and Tasmania state offices opened, followed by Victoria in 2002.\n\nIn 2008, Mission Australia Housing was established, and was joined the following year by Mission Australia Early Learning.\n\nThe following lists names of organisations that have merged and amalgamated over time to form Mission Australia:\n\n\nMission Australia has an organisational goal: \"To reduce homelessness and strengthen communities across Australia\".\n\nIts purpose – the guiding principle upon which the Mission was founded – is stated as: \"Inspired by Jesus Christ, Mission Australia exists to meet human need and to spread the knowledge of the love of God\".\n\nMission Australia lists its core values as Compassion, Integrity, Respect, Perseverance and Celebration.\n\nMission Australia's integrated nationwide services aim to help people find safe and affordable housing, support disadvantaged children and families, empower troubled young people, assist people with mental illness and disability, and more.\n\nMission Australia offers specialist support services that enable people to avoid and escape homelessness. It provides crisis and transitional accommodation, as well as social and affordable housing. In 2017-18, Mission Australia assisted 16,846 people through 62 homelessness services.\n\nIn 1979, Sydney City Mission launched the Missionbeat homelessness outreach service. Missionbeat vans patrolled the city streets offering support to homeless and intoxicated individuals. The Missionbeat Sydney service continues today, with a primary focus on supporting long-term rough sleepers. Youthbeat services, which offer support to vulnerable young people on the street, operate in Tasmania and Perth, and Mission Australia has plans to launch another mobile outreach service targeting young people in the Northern Territory.\n\nIn 2008, Mission Australia established Mission Australia Housing, a Tier 1 community housing provider. Mission Australia Housing currently owns or manages more than 1900 social and affordable homes across NSW, Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria, and houses more than 3500 residents.\n\nMission Australia provides extensive support for families and children, including high quality early learning services. Its programs and services aim to create stable, nurturing environments for children, families and communities to thrive. In 2017-18, Mission Australia assisted 23,334 people through 70 families and children services, and cared for more than 6000 children across 46 Early Learning Centres.\n\nMission Australia offers a diverse range of services to help young people engage positively with family, community, education and employment. It seeks to listen to and empower young people to lead positive change in their lives and in society. In 2017-18, Mission Australia assisted 8775 young people through 25 youth-specific services.\n\nMission Australia provides a network of place-based community development and early intervention and prevention programs tailored to meet the needs of local communities. These programs seek to listen to individuals and equip them to transform their communities. In 2017-18, Mission Australia assisted 13,094 people through 24 strengthening communities services.\n\nMission Australia helps people of all ages who have experienced barriers to employment to gain the skills and confidence to find and keep a job. It offers a variety of service models including Disability Employment Services, Transition to Work, ParentsNext and social enterprises. In 2017-18, Mission Australia assisted 11,998 people through 76 employment and skills services.\n\nRegistered Training Organisation\n\nSince its initial involvement with vocational training in the mid 1970s, Mission Australia has played a major role in providing training and education programs in a wide range of learning environments.\n\nMission Australia’s Registered Training Organisation (RTO ID 6966) is registered with the national regulator ASQA. \n\nThe RTO has undergone many changes over time, and today focuses predominantly on the provision of accredited training for individuals who wish to gain the knowledge and skills relative to career planning and learning pathways.\n\nMission Australia offers holistic support to people affected by alcohol and drug issues. Programs and services support individuals to overcome dependency, and seek to address the underlying factors that led to their addiction. In 2017-18, Mission Australia assisted 9150 people though 26 alcohol and other drug services.\n\nMission Australia provides individual, targeted and flexible care for people with mental health issues to help them overcome the challenges they face and achieve their goals. In 2017-18, Mission Australia assisted 10,149 people through 52 mental health services.\n\nMission Australia is an NDIS Partner in the Community in various locations in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia. It delivers Early Childhood Early Intervention (ECEI) and Local Area Coordination (LAC) services, helping people with disability get the supports they need and supporting their inclusion in their community. In 2017-18, Mission Australia assisted 4,160 people through 27 disability services.\n\nOther areas of Mission Australia’s work in addition to those listed above include support for people affected by domestic and family violence, people requiring financial support, and people linked to the justice and corrections system. In 2017-18, Mission Australia supported 12,233 people through 48 domestic and family violence, financial support, and justice and corrections services.\n\nMission Australia works to influence public policy relating to homelessness and disadvantage and raise awareness and support of key social issues.\n\nMission Australia undertakes research and produces publications on the key issues affecting its services and the people who access them. Its research findings also contribute to discussions about key and emerging issues with government, in the media, and within the community services sector, academia, business and the community.\n\nMission Australia’s annual Youth Survey is Australia’s largest annual survey of young people of its kind. A record 28,286 young people aged 15-19 participated in the 2018 Youth Survey, and identified mental health, alcohol and drugs, and equity and discrimination as the three most important issues in Australia today. For the first time in the survey’s 17-year history, young people identified mental health as the top issue in every state and territory across the country.\n\nMission Australia claims to be a national leader among Australian welfare organisations in the area of impact measurement. Impact measurement is a framework that helps to evaluate client outcomes for the purpose of maximising the effectiveness of services and continuously improving their impact for clients. As of March 2019, Mission Australia had 235 service sites participating in impact measurement.\n\nMission Australia seeks to influence policy decisions through submissions and reports that draw on evidence, the expertise of its staff, and the experiences of the people who access its services. Mission Australia has a long history of working with government at all levels, as both a service provider and influencer.\n\nMission Australia launched its first Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) in 2009. Its second RAP, the current Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan, launched in August 2017. The current RAP provides the framework for Mission Australia’s reconciliation journey through to June 2019 and has been endorsed by Reconciliation Australia. The RAP is an agreed strategy on how the organisation intends to contribute to reducing the gap in living standards between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.\n\nMission Australia is a registered charity with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission.\n\nThe organisation receives income from federal, state and local governments, rent, fees and fundraising. In 2017-18, Mission Australia invested 90.3% of its income back into its programs and services.\n"}

As it is often the result of scratches, involving contact with other materials, it can be confused with an allergic reaction, when in fact it is the act of being scratched that causes a wheal to appear. These wheals are a subset of urticaria (hives), and appear within minutes, in some cases accompanied by itching. The first outbreak of urticaria can lead to other reactions on body parts not directly stimulated, scraped, or scratched. In a normal case, the swelling will decrease without treatment within 15–30 minutes, but, in extreme cases, itchy red welts may last anywhere from a few hours to days.\n\nSymptoms are thought to be the result of histamine being released by mast cells on the surface of the skin. Due to the lack of antigens, histamine causes the skin to swell in affected areas. If the membrane that surrounds the mast cells is too weak it will easily and rapidly break down under physical pressure, which then causes an allergic-like reaction.\n\nSymptoms can be caused or induced by:\n\nThe underlying cause of dermographism is not known, and it can last for many years without relief. The condition may subside and be effectively cured; however, it is often a lifelong ailment. It is not a life-threatening disease, and it is not contagious.\n\nDermographism may occur in mastocytosis (systemic mast cell proliferation).\n\nThis condition is diagnosed by a health care provider writing or drawing on the patient's skin with a tongue depressor or other implement, to see whether a red wheal appears soon afterwards.\n\nDermographism can be treated by substances which prevent histamine from causing the reaction (i.e. an antihistamine). These may need to be given as a combination of H antagonists, or possibly with an H-receptor antagonist such as cimetidine.\n\nOver-the-counter vitamin C, 1000 mg daily, increases histamine degradation and removal.\n\nRefraining from taking hot baths or showers may help if the condition is generalized (i.e. all over), as well as possibly for localized cases (i.e. in a specific area). If taking hot showers helps, it may be a condition called shower eczema. If it affects mainly the head, it may be psoriasis. In rare cases, allergy tests may uncover substances the patient is allergic to.\n\nWhile cromoglycate, which prevents histamine from being released from mast cells, is used topically in rhinitis and asthma, it is not effective orally for treating chronic urticaria.\n\n"}

She was a legislator from 1994 to 2014. Between 1994 and 1998 she was the political secretary of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Water. Between 1998 and 2002 she served as Deputy Speaker of the Hungarian National Assembly.\n\nShe was the candidate of the Hungarian Socialist Party for presidency in the 2005 Hungarian presidential elections. Szili lost the election on 7 June 2005 to opposition nominee László Sólyom. The Hungarian Constitution prescribes that the President must be elected by the National Assembly of Hungary, thus the victory of the opposition came as something of a surprise. The junior coalition party, the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), however, had long emphasized that it would not vote for a partisan President. Szili as a high-ranking member of the Socialist party was considered partisan, the SZDSZ abstained, enabling the more neutral candidate Sólyom (who was originally nominated by a non-governmental organization Védegylet and later supported by the opposition), to win the office. Another reason for the failed nomination was that SZDSZ was not consulted ahead of time and Szili lacked qualifications compared to Sólyom who previously held high office as the president of the Constitutional Court of Hungary.\nIn 2009 Szili was the mayoral candidate of MSZP for the mayor of a major Hungarian city, Pécs. She lost the election to Zsolt Páva.\n\nShe became to be considered inner opposition inside the MSZP since 2009.

As a result, she quit the Hungarian Socialist Party and their parliamentary group, continuing her parliamentary work as a formally independent MP. However, as an elected parliamentarian she is serving a four-year term ending in 2014. Thus the new party Social Union instantly has some representation in Parliament, which is usually not possible for parties having won less than 5% of votes.\n\nIn 2011 Szili became a member of the Nemzeti Konzultációs Testület (National Consultative body) preparing the new \nconstitution.

{"id": "2006328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006328", "title": "Pessinus", "text": "Pessinus\n\nPessinus () was an Ancient city and archbishopric in Asia Minor, a geographical area roughly covering modern Anatolia (Asian Turkey) on the upper course of the river Sangarios (Sakarya River), remaining a Catholic (formerly double) titular see. \nPessinus, the present modern Turkish village of Ballıhisar, is centred 13 km from Sivrihisar a small town on the Ankara-Eskişehir road at the junction with the Afyon-İzmir road, 120 km southwest of Ankara. The village is on the high Anatolian plateau at 950 m above sea level. Its clustered centre is in a tributary valley of the Sakarya.\n\nThe mythological King Midas (738-696 BC?) is said to have ruled a greater Phrygian realm from Pessinus, but archaeological research since 1967 showed that the city developed around 400 BC at the earliest, which contradicts any historical claim of early Phrygian roots.\n\nAccording to ancient tradition, Pessinous was the principal cult centre of the cult of Cybele/Kybele. The Graeco-Phrygian Cybele is rooted in the old Anatolian goddess Kubaba, whose cult spread over Anatolia during the second millennium BC. Tradition situates the cult of Cybele in the early Phrygian period (8th century BC) and associates the erection of her first \"costly\" temple and even the founding of the city with king Midas (738-696 BC?). However, the Phrygian past of Pessinus is still obscure, both historically as archaeologically. For example, the geographer Strabo (12.5.3) writes that the priests were potentates in \"ancient times\", but it is unclear whether Pessinus was already a temple state ruled by \"dynastai\" in the Phrygian period. According to Cicero (Har. Resp. 8.28) the Seleucid kings held deep devotion for the shrine, which indicates the sanctuary was still much revered in this period.\n\nBy the 3rd century BC at the latest, Pessinus had become a temple state ruled by a clerical oligarchy consisting of Galloi, eunuch priests of the Mother Goddess. After the arrival of Celtic tribes in Asia Minor in 278/277 BC, and their defeat at the hand of Antiochus I during the so-called 'Battle of the Elephants' (likely 268 BC), the Celts settled in the north-central region of Anatolia which became known as Galatia. The tribe of the Tolistobogii occupied the Phrygian territory between Gordium and Pessinus. It is doubtful that the temple state actually stood under Galatian control at this early stage.\n\nRoman involvement in Pessinus however has early roots. In 205/204 BC, alarmed by a number of meteor showers during the ongoing Second Punic War, the Romans, after consulting the Sibylline Books, decided to introduce the cult of the Great Mother of Ida (\"Magna Mater Idaea\", also known as Cybele) to the city. They sought the aid of their ally Attalus I (241-197 BC), and following his instructions, they went to Pessinus and removed the goddess' most important image, a large black stone that was said to have fallen from the sky, to Rome (Livy 10.4-11.18).\n\nPergamum seems to have gained some control over Pessinus by the end of the third century BC. Pessinus was bequeathed a sanctuary by the Attalid kings, perhaps after 183 BC, when Galatia was subject to Pergamene rule.\n\nThe first century BC was a very unstable period for Pessinus with many rulers reigning over central Anatolia. According to Strabo (12.5.3) the priests gradually lost their privileges. The Mithridatic Wars (89-85 BC; 83-81 BC; 73-63 BC) caused political and economic turmoil throughout the region. When Deiotaros, tetrarch of the Tolistobogii and loyal vassal of Rome, became king of Galatia in 67/66 BC or 63 BC, Pessinus lost its status as an independent sacred principality.\n\nIn 36 BC, rule over Galatia was transferred to king Amyntas by Marc Anthony. At the death of the monarch, under Emperor Augustus the empire of the Galatians was annexed by the Imperium Romanum as the province of Galatia. Pessinus became the administrative capital of the Galatian tribe of the Tolistobogii and soon developed into a genuinely Graeco-Roman \"polis\" with a large number of monumental buildings, such as a colonnaded street and a Temple of the Imperial Cult.\n\nThe priest list on the left hand \"anta\" of the temple of Augustus and Roma in Ankara reveals that by the end of Tiberius' principate two citizens of Pessinus held the chief priesthood of the provincial imperial cult in Ancyra: M. Lollius in AD 31/32 and Q. Gallius Pulcher in AD 35/36. Strabo called Pessinus an 'emporion,' a trading centre, the largest west of the Halys river. It may be assumed that products from the Anatolian highlands were traded, especially grain and wool. A stamped handle of a wine amphora from Thasos, probably dating from the first quarter of the 3rd century BC, is proof of this trade and is at the same time the earliest written document discovered at Pessinus.\n\nVery soon after 25 BC the urbanization and transformation of the Pessinuntian temple state into a Greek polis began. Constructions such as a Corinthian temple and a colonnaded street (\"cardo maximus\") were erected with the marble from the quarries located at İstiklalbağı, ca. 6 km north of the city. The boundaries of Pessinus must have been fixed, as were those of the newly founded colony of Germakoloneia (near Babadat), which received part of the area inhabited by the Tolistobogioi. It has been argued that Pessinous and the other Galatian cities received a constitution based on that of the cities in Pontus-Bithynia, imposed by the \"lex Pompeia\". From the inscriptions it appears that Pessinus possessed several public buildings, including a gymnasium, a theatre, an archive, and baths. A system of water supply has been discovered through gutters and terracotta pipes. The most impressive public construction of the early Imperial period was the canalisation system, the earliest part of which dates from the Augustan age. It was meant to retain and carry away the waters of the Gallos, the seasonal river which traverses Pessinus and which was the main north-south artery (\"cardo maximus\") of the city. From the 1st to the 3rd century AD the canal was continuously expanded until it finally reached a length of ca. 500 m and a width of 11 to 13 m. It is not known when exactly the large theatre, of which is preserved only the emplacement of the cavea where the spectators were seated, was constructed, but it was repaired or embellished by Hadrian.\nOther monumental buildings, erected under the reign of Tiberius, included the marble peripteros temple of the provincial Imperial cult, a Sebasteion, on a hill at the north-western end of the canal, a stairway combined with a theatre in front (with an orchestra where religious and other performances such as gladiator fights took place). \nThe colonnaded square lower down the valley was reconstructed by Verlinde. In the past, this structure was wrongly situated in the Tiberian era, but it was shown that it was a monument of the Hellenistic age (late 2nd-early 1st century BC), and contemporary with the citadel that preceded the temple complex.\nChristianity reached the area in the 3rd century, and at the end of the 4th century, the temple of Augustus was decommissioned. Perhaps as a sign of the rise of Christianity in Pessinus, Emperor Julian the Apostate made a pilgrimage to Pessinus and wrote an angry letter concerning the disrespect shown to the sanctuary of Cybele. In ca. 398, Pessinus was established as the capital of the newly established province of Galatia Salutaris (in the civil Diocese of Pontus), and became the seat of a Metropolitan Archbishop. The region later became part of the Byzantine Anatolic Theme.\n\nIn late 715 AD, the city of Pessinus was destroyed by an Arab raid, along with the neighboring city Orkistos. The area remained under Byzantine control until lost to the Seljuk Turks in the latter 11th century, after which Pessinus became an inconspicuous mountain village at 900m height, gradually getting depopulated since it was fully protected.\n\nCirca AD 398, Pessinus was established as the capital of the newly established Roman province of Galatia Salutaris (=Secunda), and became the seat of a Metropolitan Archdiocese, in the sway of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\n\nDespite the Arab sack of the city in the 7th century, it has Archbishops at least until the 11th century, but ultimately was suppressed, being truly \"in partibus infidelium\" under Turkish (Seljuk, later Ottoman) Muslim rule.\n\nIt would be nominally revived in the early 20th century, both in a Latin (extant) and in an Armenian Catholic (short-lived) line of apostolic succession.\n\n\nThe following incumbents are historically known :\n\nNo later than 1901, the archdiocese was nominally restored when Pessinus of the Latins was as Latin Metropolitan Titular archbishopric of Pessinus (Latin) / Pessinonte (Curiate Italian) / Pessinuntin(us) (Latin)\n\nIt is vacant since decades, having had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting Metropolitan (highest) rank :\n\n\nThe archaeological research by Ghent University (1967–1973 under the directorship of Pieter Lambrechts; 1987–2008 under the directorship of John Devreker) of the temple area, which was discovered in 1834 by the French architect and archaeologist Charles Texier in the south of the village along the Gallos river, Angelo Verlinde's 2012 PhD dissertation, published in 2015, adds to the understanding of the temple area.\n\nAs yet, the temple area (sector B) is the only thoroughly investigated area of the city, with the exception of the so-called Acropolis (sector I) near the northern entrance of the Ballıhisar valley. Since 2009, the city is being investigated by a team of the University of Melbourne, Australia, led by Gocha Tsetskhladze.\n\nAs yet, the temple area, which was excavated between 1967 and 1972, is the only well-studied area of Pessinus. It was studied thoroughly by M. Waelkens (current director of Sagalassos excavations) in the 1980s and between 2006 and 2012 by Verlinde (Ghent University), who built on the findings of the former to analyze and reconstruct the architecture of the Corinthian peripteral temple, of which only the massive foundations remain. Investigations led to several observations, such as the Tiberian date (25-35 AD) of the cult building and its identification as a temple of the imperial cult (Sebasteion). As such, it was finally established that the excavated temple could not be identified as the Temple of Cybele, as explorer Charles Texier had done when he 'discovered' the foundations of the temple in 1834. Verlinde discovered that the building was designed on the basis of a grid, and that the governing module, determining the intervals and height of the columns, was equal to the lower diameter of the columns (0.76 m). Each intercolumnar space was equal to two modules (1.52 m), which designates the temple as a 'systyle.' \n\nFurthermore, the extraordinarily large stepped podium seems to have been influenced by Hellenistic and early Imperial pseudodipteroi. Although the temple was Tiberian, the decorative sculpture was fashioned in a conservative Augustan manner, which suggests that the building may have been design in the late Augustan period (ca. 15 AD).\nThe temple towered over the back of a theatre, which combined a central staircase with two cavea wings for spectators. It was claimed by Verlinde that this theatrical area was ritual and used for gladiatorial fights, as the theatre contained raised seats with a protective parapet, which was typical for gladiatorial theatres in the Greek east. Given that such gladiatorial combat was as a rule intertwined with the imperial cult, Verlinde argued that the epigraphically attested cult of the emperor, was once again confirmed. He also observed that there is a consistency of such theatre-temples, which were influenced by late Republican sanctuaries in Italy (e.g. the sanctuary of Hercules Victor at Tivoli), being associated with the imperial cult. The sanctuary of Augustus at Stratonicea, which was a theatre-temple as well, may have served as a model for the sanctuary in Pessinus.\n\nThe colonnaded square in front of the stairway-theatre was thought to have been part of the imperial complex. However, this was rejected by Verlinde who dated the complex to the late 2nd century BC. The architecture of the limestone complex (covered with \"stucco lustro\") emanates the style of Hellenistic \"palaestrae\" such as the Gymnasion of Eudemos at Miletus (late 3rd century BC). Being quite similar to the latter complex, the Pessinuntian square was reconstructed by Verlinde as a 'quadriporticus' with a Rhodian peristyle, that is with a high (Ionic) colonnade to the north, and three lower wings with Doric columns. The quadriporticus was an annex of the Hellenistic citadel on the promontory to the east, which preceded the early imperial temple.\n\nThe combination of a Hellenistic palace and a gymnasium (school) was a typical phenomenon of the Greek world during the Hellenistic age. Carbondating and ceramological analysis indicates that the palaestra (sports gym) was destroyed by a fire during the late Hellenistic age, suggesting that the colonnaded square as a functional entity was short-lived. After the quadriporticus was destroyed, it was not rebuilt during the early Roman period, as the area may have been used as an unpaved arena for the gladiatorial fights of the temple. In the 3rd century AD, the area was monumentalized with a new ellipse-shaped theatre and a vast marble square with a monumental funerary crypt (a funerary Heroon). This coincided with the further monumentalization of the \"cardo maximus\", which received monumental city gates in the form of arches at its southern and northern extremity.\n\n"}

Both teams were undefeated at the time.\n\nBorn in Roxbury, Massachusetts, Varney attended North Quincy High School and Deerfield Academy before enrolling at Harvard, where he played varsity football as well as baseball. In the 85th Harvard–Yale game on November 23, 1968, tight end Varney caught Frank Champi's pass for the two-point conversion in the final second to earn a tie, and a share of the Ivy League championship, with Yale. Although the famous game ended deadlocked, the furious comeback caused \"The Harvard Crimson\" to headline its game story, \"Harvard Beats Yale 29-29\". A standout in baseball, Varney batted .370 over his three varsity seasons, still the third-highest batting average in Crimson baseball history, and was selected a first-team All-American.\n\nAfter being drafted six previous times by five different Major League Baseball teams, Varney signed with the Chicago White Sox after they selected him in the first round of the secondary phase of the 1971 Major League Baseball Draft following his graduation from Harvard.

He has a massive, stony body possessed of incredible strength and endurance.\n\nBlok appeared in \"Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes\" #253 (July, 1979) by Gerry Conway and Joe Staton in an era referred to as the Bronze Age of Comic Books.\n\nBlok first appeared as a member of the League of Super-Assassins, where he was manipulated by the Dark Man, a clone of Tharok, into attacking the Legion of Super-Heroes. Blok, possibly the last of a silicon-based species native to the planet Dryad, had been convinced by Tharok that the Legion was seeking to destroy his home world, when in fact the Legionnaires were working to save it. When he learned that the Legionnaires were not his enemies, he turned on the Assassins and eventually joined the Legion. He knew very little of the rest of his race; it was not even clear to him whether his form was that of an adult or a child.\n\nBlok was relatively slow to acclimate to life in the Legion, though he eventually forged a close bond with two of his teammates, Timber Wolf and the White Witch, the latter with whom he spent a great deal of leisure time perusing the Legion's voluminous archives. He remained with the team for several years, eventually choosing to leave following the catastrophic Black Dawn affair and the increased scrutiny and suspicion of Earthgov towards all Legion activities. He eventually found his way to the Puppet Planetoid, where he spent a few years in isolated contemplation. Shortly thereafter Polar Boy officially disbanded the Legion of Super-Heroes.\n\nIn 2994, Blok's former teammates Rokk Krinn and Reep Daggle began to reorganize the team, a move which immediately attracted the attention of the corrupt Earthgov. In order to discourage and demoralize the new effort, the alien Dominators who had been secretly controlling Earthgov for years hired Roxxas to seek out and kill Blok as a warning to his other teammates. Roxxas tracked Blok down to the Puppet Planetoid and carried out his mission with ruthless efficiency, delivering Blok's dismembered corpse to the ranch home of Garth and Imra Ranzz on Winath. Far from demoralizing the other Legionnaires, however, Roxxas's act galvanized them into action, and it was directly following their discovery of Blok's murder that the Legion of Super-Heroes was officially refounded.\n\nAt the moment of his death fighting Roxxas, Blok seemed to have an out-of-body experience in which he was back on Dryad, and met Strata of L.E.G.I.O.N., who he recognized from mythology. Strata promised to finally show him the truth of his ancestral history as she led him below ground into a series of caves. Filled with joy, the gentle, philosophical Blok's last thoughts were of finally reaching enlightenment.\n\nBlok did not appear in the post-Zero Hour Legion. A female Dryadian named Brika was introduced in \"Legionnaires\" #71 (May 1999), protesting a group of colonists who intend to re-settle her hibernating clan. She was then possessed by a stone elemental named Rrox, who destroyed the planet, thinking \"No-one will ever colonize Dryad now.\"\n\nBlok appears briefly (with several other Legionnaires from previous iterations of the team such as Tyroc and Dawnstar) as a character in a 'campfire story' showing the Legion's influence, and the urban legends and myths that have sprung up around it. This appearance was a cameo, and does not appear to take place in the series actual continuity.\n\nBlok, along with many other pre-Crisis Legionnaires, appears as a statue in Superman's Fortress of Solitude. He also appears as a member of the Legion in the \"Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes\" storyline.\n\nIn \"\" #2, Blok rescues Mysa from Mordru on Zerox, being aided in the rescue by Dawnstar, Wildfire, and Rond Vidar. It is revealed at this point that Blok and Mysa are in a relationship, one that was only briefly hinted at as Blok's unrequited crush in the pre-Crisis Legion. Blok helped combat the Legion of Super-Villains until he suffered major injuries at the hand of Mordru. To save him, Mysa absorbs Mordru's magicks, becoming the Black Witch, and leaves the Legion for the Sorcerer's World when the battle is over. Once his wounds are healed, Blok follows Mysa, and convinces her to let him help her use Mordru's black magic for good.\n\nIn the \"Watchmen\" sequel \"Doomsday Clock,\" Blok is among the Legion of Super-Heroes members that appear in the present after Doctor Manhattan undid the experiment that erased the Legion of Super-Heroes and the Justice Society of America.\n\nBlok's abilities fluctuated during his career. Though his enormous size and rocky form suggested super-human strength and near-invulnerability, he did not demonstrate such abilities during his first appearance. Rather, he seemed able to absorb various sorts of energy attacks, being specifically immune to Light Lass's anti-gravity powers. In his second appearance, this was specifically stated to be an ability to increase his own mass. This power seemed not entirely under his control; when he joined the Legion, it was stated that three Legion flight-rings were required to lift him. Why his teammate Colossal Boy (who could also increase his mass and size) could make do with a single flight ring, but Blok could not, was never explained.\n\nDuring Blok's Legion tenure, it was stated definitely that he had massive super-human strength. Its relative limits were never made clear; it was stated that he could not match the levels of pre-Crisis Kryptonians and Daxamites or Ultra Boy, but seemed stronger than Timber Wolf and, possibly, Colossal Boy. Contrary to this, his durability was greater than that of the latter two heroes, though still not quite on Kryptonian levels. This may have been contradicted when he was able to hold his own against pre-Crisis Daxamites hand-to-hand during a Darkseid led invasion of the United Planets during the Great Darkness Saga in \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" (vol. 2) #294. His recuperative abilities were likewise vague. In his earliest experiences, his body included a collar-like formation around his neck which was destroyed during the Great Darkness Saga and never regrew, but he seemed unharmed by its lack. A formation on his face that resembled a nose was likewise apparently chipped away.\n\nBlok was also written as having the ability to communicate telepathically with other silicon-based life forms. Despite his searching, he never did find any, so this ability went unexplored.\n\nOver time, his earlier abilities to change his mass and absorb energy were de-emphasized in favor of his super-strength. Towards the end of his life he began to mutate into a different form, larger than before and possessed of several protuberances which expelled energetic plasma from time to time. It was speculated that Blok's earlier form had been an immature, possibly larval state, and the changes in his body were actually a metamorphosis like that of a butterfly. Another supposition was that he was reaching maturity and beginning to show signs of that race's indication that he was male. A 20th century Dryadian, Strata of L.E.G.I.O.N., metamorphosed into a diamond-like version. When asked about the metamorphosis, she replied, \"I guess that means I'm female.\"\n\nAs a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes he is provided a Legion Flight Ring. It allows him to fly and protects him from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments. His ring was modified to handle the increased mass of Blok as he originally has to wear three rings due to his massive size.\n\n\nJesse Murray of Syfy placed Blok as the 33rd greatest Legion of Super-Heroes member of all time describing him as \"once a misguided bad guy who saw the light\".\nProducer of \"\", James Tucker cited the character as a favorite Legion of Superheroes character of his.\n\n"}

His approach meant that the rest of Spiritualized was given the songs on the same day as they were recorded, meaning the record (including orchestral overdubs) was completed in 3 weeks. This is a huge difference compared to its predecessor, Let It Come Down, which took four years to record.\n\nThe album is generally harder-edged than its predecessors, featuring a number of variations on the familiar Spiritualized \"Electricity\" garage-rock riff. Conversely, \"The Ballad of Richie Lee\" is a tender, organ-driven tribute to the lead singer of the American group Acetone, a friend of Pierce, who committed suicide in 2001. The song was used in the final scene of the film \"The Unloved\", whose director, actress Samantha Morton, is a close friend of Pierce's.\n\nTwo singles were released, \"She Kissed Me (It Felt Like a Hit)\" and \"Cheapster.\" The former song's title is a reference to the song \"He Hit Me (It Felt Like A Kiss)\" by the 1960s girl group The Crystals, and the latter's is a likely reference to T.

His towering 6 ft 5 in (196 cm) presence and intimidating face usually got him roles playing tough guys, thugs, strong men, and gangsters.\n\nMazurki was born Markiyan (Mykhailo) Mazurkevych () () in the village of Kupchyntsi (in present-day Kozova Raion), near what was then Tarnopol, Galicia, Austria-Hungary (now Ternopil, Ukraine). He was from an ethnic Ukrainian family. In 1913, he emigrated with his family to the United States living in Cohoes, New York, just outside Albany, in old mill housing on Olmstead Street with his mother.\n\nMazurki attended LaSalle Institute in Troy, for high school. Upon finishing school, he changed his name to \"Mike\". He played football and basketball at Manhattan College, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1930. After earning his bachelor's degree, Mazurki graduated from Fordham Law School and became an attorney. He later said he took up professional wrestling because he could earn around ten times what he could as a lawyer. Mazurki was also a professional American football and basketball player.\n\nMazurki was discovered by Josef von Sternberg and given a bit part in his film \"The Shanghai Gesture\" (1941). This led to a long film and television career. Possibly his most memorable role was that of slow-witted thug Moose Malloy in the film noir \"Murder, My Sweet\" (1944), opposite Dick Powell. He portrayed the psychotic, knife-wielding murderer Splitface in the original \"Dick Tracy\" (1945). He played a wrestler nicknamed \"The Strangler\" in \"Night and the City\" (1950) and a role imitating the manner of a George Raft henchman in the Billy Wilder comedy, \"Some Like It Hot\" (1959). He continued to wrestle during his acting career. His slurred speech was reportedly due to a wrestling injury to his Adam's apple.\n\nin addition to his film work, Mazurki made guest appearances on many popular television shows, among them \"My Friend Flicka\" (as a wrestler facing Gene Evans's character of Rob McLaughlin), \"The Untouchables\", \"Bachelor Father\", \"Daniel Boone\", \"Gilligan's Island\", \"The Munsters\", \"I Dream of Jeannie\", \"Bonanza\", and \"Gunsmoke\", to name just a few. In 1964 he played Cully Barstow, a yacht hand, in \"The Case of the Missing Button\", an episode of \"Perry Mason\" in which he threatened Mason and Paul Drake with a set of brass knuckles. He also played Arthur Jacks in the episode \"The Case of the Deadly Verdict\" (1963). He was a regular as well on the short-lived sitcom \"The Chicago Teddy Bears\".\n\nAlong with his film and television appearances, Mazurki was seen in the hit Rod Stewart music video \"Infatuation\", playing the bodyguard protecting a woman (played by Kay Lenz) from a stalker (played by Stewart). In the end, he succeeds, punching out Stewart. In 1966–67, he performed as the caveman \"Clon\" in \"It's About Time\".\n\nIn 1965, he co-founded and became the first president of the Cauliflower Alley Club, an association of professional wrestlers. A photograph of his cauliflower ear forms the logo of the organization. He was posthumously awarded the New York State Award in 2005 by the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum for founding the club. \n\nIn 1975, he landed his only starring role in a film as Trapper in \"Challenge to be Free\". The movie went largely unnoticed, but Mazurki drew praise for his convincing performance as a solitary-minded, nature-loving wilderness man wrongly accused of manslaughter.\n\nAs he aged, acting opportunities for Mazurki began to slow in the 1970s and 1980s; nevertheless, he continued working until his death on December 9, 1990. His final film role, that of \"Don Taglianeti\", is in the low-budget comedy \"Mob Boss\", which was released just two months before he died.\n\n"}

Later after firing the original maids, he needed to be looked after so he decided to hire new live-in maids. While originally expecting an elderly woman to take the job, two runaway girls, Izumi, 14, and Mitsuki, 13, end up accepting the job as means for a home and income. Another girl, Anna, later becomes a maid as well, and all three live in the mansion with Yoshitaka. The boy pulls some clichéd pranks throughout the story.\n\n\nIn every episode God is mentioned and it shows avatars of the show's creators doing actions. Occasionally the avatars do something relevant to the plot (such as draw a picture of clothing and stick a fountain pen in Yoshitakas head to make him think he drew it).\n\nAt the end of each episode, with the exception of episode 9 and 10, 4 recurring gags are shown; the first gag shows an exhausted Izumi either in bed or bathing. The second gag shows Mitsuki working on her photobook of Izumi's revealing pictures taken from hidden cameras earlier on in the episode. The third gag shows a frustrated Yoshitaka in a small, messy room working on draft designs for new outfits for his maids. The fourth gag shows an aerial shot of the mansion with Yoshitaka ranting or manically laughing, and two numbers show up. The first number is the amount of damages Izumi must pay off for that particular day, and the second number is the amount of money she has left to pay, listed in yen. And, in some of the episodes it shows Mitsuki's earnings for that day.\n\n\nThe anime series received mixed to negative reviews.\n\nOn Anime News Network (ANN), the DVD Complete Collection of He Is My Master was reviewed, and was given an overall cautiously positive rating, saying \"This is not a masterpiece but is definitely better than it could have been\". High points of the series mentioned are Yoshitaka's (the male lead) very evil personality, which is very refreshing to see after hundreds of indecisive and weak male leads in harem-fanservice series similar to this. Other good points are the comedy and plentiful fanservice. One of the biggest negative points in this series are the stereotypical elements that freely abound the series. Cliches are left and right, and sometimes detract from the comedy. ANN rated this anime in 5 categories, the average of which was a B−.\n\n\n"}

The concept of No Nights 2 Days will still go on. Both teams will have their own hot places to recommend and go by themselves, and depending on the editors of the show, airtime is allocated to each team as they favour.\n\nIn each episode, the cast and guest(s) gather together at around 12 a.m. (KST), then proceed to their base camp, which was set up nearby the popular place.

At the base camp, they will be camping overnight and, in the next morning, attempt to be the first in line as a team to enter the popular place. Before the start of the overnight camping, the group's handphones are confiscated. The reason being, if not, the group can just set alarms on their phones and wake up in the morning just in time to start to get for first place, which is not allowed at all.\n\nDuring the overnight camping, a time fairy will appear to help the cast by telling the time and get the cast to play the time fairy's game to get over the overnight camping and elevate the chances of entering in first place.\n\nFrom episode 6, the show's production concept was altered (to No Nights 2 Days) so that filming on each location is now split into 2 episodes, with first half filmed during the day. The first of every 2 episodes will not involve overnight camping, as the targeted hot place(s) opens either at noon, evening or night. The second will involve the original concept of the program.

It is a sequel to \"Doom II\" (1994). A remastered port was released for Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in March 2020, and on Stadia in May 2020.\n\n\"Doom 64\" plays similarly to earlier games in the \"Doom\" series; the player must advance through 32 levels battling demons, collecting weapons and keys, and activating switches to reach the level's exit while surviving deadly ambushes and traps. Changes were made to the \"Doom\" engine for use in \"Doom 64\", and gameplay elements were altered.\n\nAll the weapons from \"Doom II\" are present, but redrawn with new sprites and sound effects. The chainsaw has two blades instead of one, the fists have bloodstained gloves instead of brass knuckles, the plasma gun has an electric core that emits a sparking sound when equipped, the rocket launcher has a small kick when fired, pushing the player back slightly, the shotgun's priming handle is at the grip instead of under the barrel, and the double-barreled \"Super\" shotgun reloads faster and causes recoil.\n\nA new weapon known as the Laser, or \"Unmaker\", was added, using the same cell ammunition as the plasma gun and BFG 9000. It was first mentioned in the \"Doom Bible\" and was planned to be featured in the PC \"Doom\" games, but never appeared. Its appearance in \"Doom 64\" is its only official appearance prior to \"Doom Eternal\", albeit spelled \"Unmaykr\" in that game. With the power of three ancient artifacts found in the game, it becomes more powerful by shooting three laser beams (at a quicker rate than default) instead of one. The first artifact increases the laser speed, the second artifact adds a second laser, and the third artifact allows the weapon to fire three simultaneous lasers which can automatically aim separately from one another, allowing the weapon to attack three different enemies at once.\n\nFollowing the Doom Marine's success thwarting hell in \"Doom\" and \"\", a planetary policy is established to quarantine the UAC research installations with apocalyptic levels of radiation. For years, the installations stood motionless and abandoned, until a long forgotten satellite monitoring one of the installations, barely functioning due to years of being subjected to the high levels of radiation, sends a message back to Earth.\n\nThe message indicates that a single entity, with vast rejuvenation powers and masked by the extreme radiation levels, managed to escape detection. This entity was able to systematically alter decaying dead carnage back into corrupted living tissue, resurrecting the demons.\n\nAs the only experienced survivor of the \"DOOM\" episodes, the Doom Marine is sent in alone to exterminate them. Later, he realizes the demons had planned for this, after he unknowingly allowed himself to be lured back into hell. Despite this, the demons are unable to defeat him, and with the Unmaker, he eventually battles and kills the Mother Demon. The game ends with the Doom Marine, no longer capable of having a normal life following his encounters with hell's forces, deciding to remain in hell forever to ensure no demon ever rises again.\n\n\"Doom 64\" was developed by Midway Games at its San Diego studio. id Software, the primary developer of the \"Doom\" franchise, supervised the project. Development began in late 1994. Midway's original title of the game was \"The Absolution\", however the name was changed to \"Doom 64\" for brand recognition (\"The Absolution\" was reused as the name of the last level in the game). Midway wanted to include every demon from the original games, as well as a few extra levels, into the final product, but deadlines and memory constraints of the small capacity of the N64 cartridges made them scrap the levels and leave a few demons out of the game. Midway stated that a multiplayer mode was not included because Nintendo did not provide the necessary resources for multiplayer programming. The developer justified the decision based on alleged slowdown during split-screen multiplayer in other games on the console and the competitive nature of the mode. \"Everyone knows that the best part of playing multiplayer is not knowing where your opponent is,\" stated a Midway representative, \"and with a four-player split-screen, everyone can easily see where their opponents are.\"\n\nThe environments were built from 3-dimensional polygon models, while the enemies were created by pre-rendering sprites with SGI workstations. The Nightmare Imp was originally developed for the PlayStation version of \"Doom\" and appeared in a near-complete beta of the game, but was removed just prior to release for unknown reasons. As such, it made its debut in \"Doom 64\" instead.\n\n\"Doom 64\" was slated to be a North American launch title, but near the deadline id Software expressed dissatisfaction with many of the level designs, so Midway postponed the game until April 1997 while they worked on redesigning the levels. Nintendo's then-recent decision to remove the ability to run over animals from the Nintendo 64 version of \"Cruis'n USA\" raised concerns about the possibility of \"Doom 64\" being censored, but Midway vice president of software Mike Abbot said Nintendo had not voiced any concerns about the game's violent content. He pointed out that \"Cruis'n USA\" was perceived by the public as a family game, while the \"Doom\" series was targeted towards mature gamers, making violent content less of a concern.\n\nThe music and sound effects were composed by Aubrey Hodges, who also created the original sound effects and music for the PlayStation port of \"Doom\" two years earlier. The original \"Doom 64\" team was working on a potential sequel titled \"Doom Absolution\" designed only for two-player deathmatches not long after the first game was released, but decided to scrap it. Because id Software were impressed with their work on \"Doom 64\", they were assigned to the Nintendo 64 version of \"Quake\" at this time, and this presumably kept them too busy to work on other projects.\n\nMidway Home Entertainment shipped \"Doom 64\" on March 29, 1997, for release on April 4.\n\nBy the time \"Doom 64\" was released, the original \"Doom\" had received ports on nearly every platform capable of running it. Critics agreed that \"Doom 64\" was by far the best-looking \"Doom\" to date, exceeding even the PC version, and were enthusiastic about the level designs, deeming them imaginative and much more challenging than those of the original \"Doom\". A \"Next Generation\" critic remarked that \"even the most skillful \"Doom\" fans will have their hands full. And pushing door switches often causes whole rooms to rearrange and fold out into new shapes.\"\n\nHowever, most reviewers felt that the new graphics and levels were not enough to keep the game from feeling like yet another port of the original \"Doom\". Peer Schneider of \"IGN\" concluded, \"Make no mistake about it, this is the best update to \"Doom\" so far -- but if you've played the PC, PSX, SNES, Mac, Saturn, etc versions to death, you can do without this one.\" \"GamePro\" disagreed with the majority on this point, stating that \"\"Doom 64\" pumps the tried-and-true corridor-shooter formula full of life, with another challenging, intense experience that showcases the system's capabilities.\" They rated it a perfect 5.0 out of 5 in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and fun factor). Shawn Smith of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" instead regarded the lack of advancements in the basic \"Doom\" gameplay as a positive: \"Some of you may want to see your space Marine jumping around or swimming underwater. Purists wouldn't want these features added because \"Doom\" wasn't about that stuff.

It is broadcast on FM from a nationwide network of transmitters, as well as via the internet.\n\nThe channel announced during 2016 that it would discontinue transmissions from the Allouis longwave transmitter on 162 kHz with effect from 1 January 2017, thereby saving approximately €6 million per year. Transmission from Allouis of the atomic-clock-generated time signal would, however, continue after this date as the signal is critical for over 200,000 devices deployed within French enterprises and state entities, such as French Railways (SNCF), the electricity distributor ENEDIS, airports, hospitals, municipalities, etc.\n\nFrance Inter was founded as part of the reorganization of state broadcasting which followed the end of World War II as \"Paris-Inter\" and charged with being French public radio's generalist (i.e. \"full-service\") service. The channel was renamed \"France I\" in 1958, although three years later one of France's most popular radio and television listings magazines was still showing the station's programmes under the heading \"Paris-Inter\" with \"France I\" as a subtitle.

For this album Beefheart wanted more commercial success – hence his decision to work with the widely respected team of producer Ted Templeman and engineer Donn Landee, who previously created hits for artists such as the Doobie Brothers, Carly Simon and Van Morrison. \"Clear Spot\" gathers together much of the lyrical material that Beefheart had created or formulated at the beginning of \"The Spotlight Kid\" recordings.\n\nFormer Mothers of Invention and Little Feat bassist Roy Estrada joined the band on this album and is credited as \"Oréjon\" (big ears) on the album's sleeve while noted session percussionist Milt Holland also contributed percussion.\n\nThe original United States release of the album was in a specially-produced clear plastic sleeve. The title \"Clear Spot\" was embossed on the front flap, with the record clearly visible inside without a liner. This reflected the title: a clear cover with the black vinyl disc as a visible spot. The original concept was for the disc to be of clear vinyl, but this was abandoned due to financial constraints. The package also included a white card insert, with the band name and credits. For the UK this was a single weight card, but in the US issues this was back-to-back card with radius corners at the foot.\n\nFor U.S. reissues and initial release in other countries, a more traditional black-on-white printed sleeve was employed.

In particular, this means that if \"B\" is low for \"A\" then \"B\" is contained in \"A\". Informally, lowness means that problems in \"B\" are not only solvable by machines which can solve problems in \"A\", but are “easy to solve”. An \"A\" machine can simulate many oracle queries to \"B\" without exceeding its resource bounds.\n\nResults and relationships that establish one class as low for another are often called lowness results. The set of languages low for a complexity class \"A\" is denoted \"Low(A)\".\n\nSeveral natural complexity classes are known to be low for themselves. Such a class is sometimes called \"self-low\". Scott Aaronson calls such a class a \"physical complexity class\". Note that being self-low is a stronger condition than being closed under complement. Informally, a class being low for itself means a problem can use other problems in the class as unit-cost subroutines without exceeding the power of the complexity class.\n\nThe following classes are known to be self-low:\n\n\nEvery class which is low for itself is closed under complement, provided that it is powerful enough to negate the boolean result. This implies that NP isn't low for itself unless NP = co-NP, which is considered unlikely because it implies that the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the first level, whereas it is widely believed that the hierarchy is infinite. The converse to this statement is not true. If a class is closed under complement, it does not mean that the class is low for itself. An example of such a class is EXP, which is closed under complement, but is not low for itself.\n\nSome of the more complex and famous results regarding lowness of classes include:\n\nLowness is particularly valuable in relativization arguments, where it can be used to establish that the power of a class does not change in the \"relativized universe\" where a particular oracle machine is available for free. This allows us to reason about it in the same manner we normally would. For example, in the relativized universe of BQP, PP is still closed under union and intersection. It's also useful when seeking to expand the power of a machine with oracles, because lowness results determine when the machine's power remains the same.\n\n"}

Richardson and Douglas Osheroff \"for their discovery of superfluidity in helium-3.\"\n\nLee was born and raised in Rye, New York. His parents, Annette (Franks), a teacher, and Marvin Lee, an electrical engineer, were children of Jewish immigrants from England and Lithuania. He graduated from Harvard University in 1952 and then joined the U.S. Army for 22 months. After being discharged from the army, he obtained a master's degree from the University of Connecticut. In 1955 Lee entered the Ph.D. program at Yale University where he worked under Henry A. Fairbank in the low-temperature physics group, doing experimental research on liquid He.\n\nAfter graduating from Yale in 1959, Lee took a job at Cornell University, where he was responsible for setting up the new Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics. Shortly after arriving at Cornell he met his future wife, Dana, then a PhD student in another department; the couple went on to have two sons.\n\nLee moved his laboratory from Cornell to Texas A&M University on November 16, 2009.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, Lee lost his wife, Dana, due to un-diagnosed health issues.\n\nThe work that led to Lee's Nobel Prize was performed in the early 1970s. Lee, together with Robert C. Richardson and graduate student, Doug Osheroff used a Pomeranchuk cell to investigate the behaviour of He at temperatures within a few thousandths of a degree of absolute zero. They discovered unexpected effects in their measurements, which they eventually explained as phase transitions to a superfluid phase of He. Lee, Richardson and Osheroff were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1996 for this discovery.\n\nLee's research also covered a number of other topics in low-temperature physics, particularly relating to liquid, solid and superfluid helium (He, He and mixtures of the two). Particular discoveries include the antiferromagnetic ordering in solid helium-3, nuclear spin waves in spin polarized atomic hydrogen gas with Jack H. Freed, and the tri-critical point on the phase separation curve of liquid He-He, in collaboration with his Cornell colleague John Reppy. His former research group at Cornell currently studies impurity-helium solids.\n\nAs well as the Nobel Prize, other prizes won by Lee include the 1976 Sir Francis Simon Memorial Prize of the British Institute of Physics and the 1981 Oliver Buckley Prize of the American Physical Society along with Doug Osheroff and Robert Richardson for their superfluid He work.\n\nLee is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nLee is currently teaching physics at Texas A&M University and continuing his (formerly Cornell-based) research program there as well.\n\nLee is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W.

{"id": "2006521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006521", "title": "Neural crest", "text": "Neural crest\n\nNeural crest cells are a temporary group of cells unique to vertebrates that arise from the embryonic ectoderm germ layer, and in turn give rise to a diverse cell lineage—including melanocytes, craniofacial cartilage and bone, smooth muscle, peripheral and enteric neurons and glia.\n\nAfter gastrulation, neural crest cells are specified at the border of the neural plate and the non-neural ectoderm. During neurulation, the borders of the neural plate, also known as the neural folds, converge at the dorsal midline to form the neural tube. Subsequently, neural crest cells from the roof plate of the neural tube undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, delaminating from the neuroepithelium and migrating through the periphery where they differentiate into varied cell types. The emergence of neural crest was important in vertebrate evolution because many of its structural derivatives are defining features of the vertebrate clade. \nUnderlying the development of neural crest is a gene regulatory network, described as a set of interacting signals, transcription factors, and downstream effector genes that confer cell characteristics such as multipotency and migratory capabilities. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of neural crest formation is important for our knowledge of human disease because of its contributions to multiple cell lineages. Abnormalities in neural crest development cause neurocristopathies, which include conditions such as frontonasal dysplasia, Waardenburg–Shah syndrome, and DiGeorge syndrome.\n\nTherefore, defining the mechanisms of neural crest development may reveal key insights into vertebrate evolution and neurocristopathies.\n\nNeural crest was first described in the chick embryo by Wilhelm His Sr. in 1868 as \"the cord in between\" (Zwischenstrang) because of its origin between the neural plate and non-neural ectoderm. He named the tissue ganglionic crest since its final destination was each lateral side of the neural tube where it differentiated into spinal ganglia. During the first half of the 20th century the majority of research on neural crest was done using amphibian embryos which was reviewed by Hörstadius (1950) in a well known monograph.\nCell labeling techniques advanced the field of neural crest because they allowed researchers to visualize the migration of the tissue throughout the developing embryos. In the 1960s Weston and Chibon utilized radioisotopic labeling of the nucleus with tritiated thymidine in chick and amphibian embryo respectively. However, this method suffers from drawbacks of stability, since every time the labeled cell divides the signal is diluted. Modern cell labeling techniques such as rhodamine-lysinated dextran and the vital dye diI have also been developed to transiently mark neural crest lineages.\n\nThe quail-chick marking system, devised by Nicole Le Douarin in 1969, was another instrumental technique used to track neural crest cells. Chimeras, generated through transplantation, enabled researchers to distinguish neural crest cells of one species from the surrounding tissue of another species. With this technique, generations of scientists were able to reliably mark and study the ontogeny of neural crest cells.\n\nA molecular cascade of events is involved in establishing the migratory and multipotent characteristics of neural crest cells. This gene regulatory network can be subdivided into the following four sub-networks described below.\n\nFirst, extracellular signaling molecules, secreted from the adjacent epidermis and underlying mesoderm such as Wnts, BMPs and Fgfs separate the non-neural ectoderm (epidermis) from the neural plate during neural induction.\n\nWnt signaling has been demonstrated in neural crest induction in several species through gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments. In coherence with this observation, the promoter region of slug (a neural crest specific gene) contains a binding site for transcription factors involved in the activation of Wnt-dependent target genes, suggestive of a direct role of Wnt signaling in neural crest specification.\n\nThe current role of BMP in neural crest formation is associated with the induction of the neural plate. BMP antagonists diffusing from the ectoderm generates a gradient of BMP activity. In this manner, the neural crest lineage forms from intermediate levels of BMP signaling required for the development of the neural plate (low BMP) and epidermis (high BMP).\n\nFgf from the paraxial mesoderm has been suggested as a source of neural crest inductive signal. Researchers have demonstrated that the expression of dominate-negative Fgf receptor in ectoderm explants blocks neural crest induction when recombined with paraxial mesoderm. The understanding of the role of BMP, Wnt, and Fgf pathways on neural crest specifier expression remains incomplete.\n\nSignaling events that establish the neural plate border lead to the expression of a set of transcription factors delineated here as neural plate border specifiers. These molecules include Zic factors, Pax3/7, Dlx5, Msx1/2 which may mediate the influence of Wnts, BMPs, and Fgfs. These genes are expressed broadly at the neural plate border region and precede the expression of bona fide neural crest markers.\n\nExperimental evidence places these transcription factors upstream of neural crest specifiers. For example, in \"Xenopus\" Msx1 is necessary and sufficient for the expression of Slug, Snail, and FoxD3. Furthermore, Pax3 is essential for FoxD3 expression in mouse embryos.\n\nFollowing the expression of neural plate border specifiers is a collection of genes including Slug/Snail, FoxD3, Sox10, Sox9, AP-2 and c-Myc. This suite of genes, designated here as neural crest specifiers, are activated in emergent neural crest cells. At least in Xenopus, every neural crest specifier is necessary and/or sufficient for the expression of all other specifiers, demonstrating the existence of extensive cross-regulation. Moreover, this model organism was instrumental in the elucidation of the role of the Hedghehog signaling pathway in the specification of the neural crest, with the transcription factor Gli2 playing a key role.\n\nOutside of the tightly regulated network of neural crest specifiers are two other transcription factors Twist and Id. Twist, a bHLH transcription factor, is required for mesenchyme differentiation of the pharyngeal arch structures. Id is a direct target of c-Myc and is known to be important for the maintenance of neural crest stem cells.\n\nFinally, neural crest specifiers turn on the expression of effector genes, which confer certain properties such as migration and multipotency. Two neural crest effectors, \"Rho GTPases\" and \"cadherins\", function in delamination by regulating cell morphology and adhesive properties. Sox9 and Sox10 regulate neural crest differentiation by activating many cell-type-specific effectors including Mitf, P0, Cx32, Trp and cKit.\nThe migration of neural crest cells involves a highly coordinated cascade of events that begins with closure of the dorsal neural tube.\n\nAfter fusion of the neural fold to create the neural tube, cells originally located in the neural plate border become neural crest cells. For migration to begin, neural crest cells must undergo a process called delamination that involves a full or partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Delamination is defined as the separation of tissue into different populations, in this case neural crest cells separating from the surrounding tissue. Conversely, EMT is a series of events coordinating a change from an epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype. For example, delamination in chick embryos is triggered by a BMP/Wnt cascade that induces the expression of EMT promoting transcription factors such as SNAI2 and FoxD3. Although all neural crest cells undergo EMT, the timing of delamination occurs at different stages in different organisms: in \"Xenopus laevis\" embryos there is a massive delamination that occurs when the neural plate is not entirely fused, whereas delamination in the chick embryo occurs during fusion of the neural fold.\n\nPrior to delamination, presumptive neural crest cells are initially anchored to neighboring cells by tight junction proteins such as occludin and cell adhesion molecules such as NCAM and N\"-\"Cadherin. Dorsally expressed BMPs initiate delamination by inducing the expression of the zinc finger protein transcription factors snail, slug, and twist. These factors play a direct role in inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition by reducing expression of occludin and N-Cadherin in addition to promoting modification of NCAMs with polysialic acid residues to decrease adhesiveness. Neural crest cells also begin expressing proteases capable of degrading cadherins such as ADAM10 and secreting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade the overlying basal lamina of the neural tube to allow neural crest cells to escape. Additionally, neural crest cells begin expressing integrins that associate with extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen, fibronectin, and laminin, during migration. Once the basal lamina becomes permeable the neural crest cells can begin migrating throughout the embryo.\n\nNeural crest cell migration occurs in a rostral to caudal direction without the need of a neuronal scaffold such as along a radial glial cell. For this reason the crest cell migration process is termed “free migration”. Instead of scaffolding on progenitor cells, neural crest migration is the result of repulsive guidance via EphB/EphrinB and semaphorin/neuropilin signaling, interactions with the extracellular matrix, and contact inhibition with one another. While Ephrin and Eph proteins have the capacity to undergo bi-directional signaling, neural crest cell repulsion employs predominantly forward signaling to initiate a response within the receptor bearing neural crest cell. Burgeoning neural crest cells express EphB, a receptor tyrosine kinase, which binds the EphrinB transmembrane ligand expressed in the caudal half of each somite. When these two domains interact it causes receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of rhoGTPases, and eventual cytoskeletal rearrangements within the crest cells inducing them to repel. This phenomenon allows neural crest cells to funnel through the rostral portion of each somite.\n\nSemaphorin-neuropilin repulsive signaling works synergistically with EphB signaling to guide neural crest cells down the rostral half of somites in mice. In chick embryos, semaphorin acts in the cephalic region to guide neural crest cells through the pharyngeal arches. On top of repulsive repulsive signaling, neural crest cells express β1and α4 integrins which allows for binding and guided interaction with collagen, laminin, and fibronectin of the extracellular matrix as they travel. Additionally, crest cells have intrinsic contact inhibition with one another while freely invading tissues of different origin such as mesoderm. Neural crest cells that migrate through the rostral half of somites differentiate into sensory and sympathetic neurons of the peripheral nervous system. The other main route neural crest cells take is dorsolaterally between the epidermis and the dermamyotome. Cells migrating through this path differentiate into pigment cells of the dermis. Further neural crest cell differentiation and specification into their final cell type is biased by their spatiotemporal subjection to morphogenic cues such as BMP, Wnt, FGF, Hox, and Notch.\n\nNeurocristopathies result from the abnormal specification, migration, differentiation or death of neural crest cells throughout embryonic development. This group of diseases comprises a wide spectrum of congenital malformations affecting many newborns. Additionally, they arise because of genetic defects affecting the formation of neural crest and because of the action of Teratogens \n\nWaardenburg's syndrome is a neurocristopathy that results from defective neural crest cell migration. The condition's main characteristics include piebaldism and congenital deafness. In the case of piebaldism, the colorless skin areas are caused by a total absence of neural crest-derived pigment-producing melanocytes. There are four different types of Waardenburg's syndrome, each with distinct genetic and physiological features. Types I and II are distinguished based on whether or not family members of the affected individual have dystopia canthorum. Type III gives rise to upper limb abnormalities. Lastly, type IV is also known as Waardenburg-Shah syndrome, and afflicted individuals display both Waardenburg's syndrome and Hirschsprung's disease. Types I and III are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, while II and IV exhibit an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Overall, Waardenburg's syndrome is rare, with an incidence of ~ 2/100,000 people in the United States. All races and sexes are equally affected. There is no current cure or treatment for Waardenburg's syndrome.\n\nAlso implicated in defects related to neural crest cell development and migration is Hirschsprung's disease (HD or HSCR), characterized by a lack of innervation in regions of the intestine. This lack of innervation can lead to further physiological abnormalities like an enlarged colon (megacolon), obstruction of the bowels, or even slowed growth. In healthy development, neural crest cells migrate into the gut and form the enteric ganglia. Genes playing a role in the healthy migration of these neural crest cells to the gut include RET, GDNF, GFRα, EDN3, and EDNRB. RET, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), forms a complex with GDNF and GFRα. EDN3 and EDNRB are then implicated in the same signaling network. When this signaling is disrupted in mice, aganglionosis, or the lack of these enteric ganglia occurs.\n\nPrenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is among the most common causes of developmental defects. Depending on the extent of the exposure and the severity of the resulting abnormalities, patients are diagnosed within a continuum of disorders broadly labeled Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Severe FASD can impair neural crest migration, as evidenced by characteristic craniofacial abnormalities including short palpebral fissures, an elongated upper lip, and a smoothened philtrum. However, due to the promiscuous nature of ethanol binding, the mechanisms by which these abnormalities arise is still unclear. Cell culture explants of neural crest cells as well as in vivo developing zebrafish embryos exposed to ethanol show a decreased number of migratory cells and decreased distances travelled by migrating neural crest cells. The mechanisms behind these changes are not well understood, but evidence suggests PAE can increase apoptosis due to increased cytosolic calcium levels caused by IP3-mediated release of calcium from intracellular stores. It has also been proposed that the decreased viability of ethanol-exposed neural crest cells is caused by increased oxidative stress. Despite these, and other advances much remains to be discovered about how ethanol affects neural crest development. For example, it appears that ethanol differentially affects certain neural crest cells over others; that is, while craniofacial abnormalities are common in PAE, neural crest-derived pigment cells appear to be minimally affected.\n\nDiGeorge syndrome is associated with deletions or translocations of a small segment in the human chromosome 22. This deletion may disrupt rostral neural crest cell migration or development. Some defects observed are linked to the pharyngeal pouch system, which receives contribution from rostral migratory crest cells. The symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome include congenital heart defects, facial defects, and some neurological and learning disabilities. Patients with 22q11 deletions have also been reported to have higher incidence of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n\nTreacher Collins Syndrome (TCS) results from the compromised development of the first and second pharyngeal arches during the early embryonic stage, which ultimately leads to mid and lower face abnormalities. TCS is caused by the missense mutation of the TCOF1 gene, which causes neural crest cells to undergo apoptosis during embryogenesis. Although mutations of the TCOF1 gene are among the best characterized in their role in TCS, mutations in POLR1C and POLR1D genes have also been linked to the pathogenesis of TCS.\n\nNeural crest cells originating from different positions along the anterior-posterior axis develop into various tissues. These regions of neural crest can be divided into four main functional domains, which include the cranial neural crest, trunk neural crest, vagal and sacral neural crest, and cardiac neural crest.\n\nCranial neural crest migrates dorsolaterally to form the craniofacial mesenchyme that differentiates into various cranial ganglia and craniofacial cartilages and bones. These cells enter the pharyngeal pouches and arches where they contribute to the thymus, bones of the middle ear and jaw and the odontoblasts of the tooth primordia.\n\nTrunk neural crest gives rise two populations of cells. One group of cells fated to become melanocytes migrates dorsolaterally into the ectoderm towards the ventral midline. A second group of cells migrates ventrolaterally through the anterior portion of each sclerotome. The cells that stay in the sclerotome form the dorsal root ganglia, whereas those that continue more ventrally form the sympathetic ganglia, adrenal medulla, and the nerves surrounding the aorta.\n\nThe vagal and sacral neural crest cells develop into the ganglia of the enteric nervous system and the parasympathetic ganglia.\n\nCardiac neural crest develops into melanocytes, cartilage, connective tissue and neurons of some pharyngeal arches. Also, this domain gives rise to regions of the heart such as the musculo-connective tissue of the large arteries, and part of the septum, which divides the pulmonary circulation from the aorta.\nThe semilunar valves of the heart are associated with neural crest cells according to new research.\n\nSeveral structures that distinguish the vertebrates from other chordates are formed from the derivatives of neural crest cells. In their \"New head\" theory, Gans and Northcut argue that the presence of neural crest was the basis for vertebrate specific features, such as sensory ganglia and cranial skeleton. Furthermore, the appearance of these features was pivotal in vertebrate evolution because it enabled a predatory lifestyle.\n\nHowever, considering the neural crest a vertebrate innovation does not mean that it arose \"de novo\". Instead, new structures often arise through modification of existing developmental regulatory programs. For example, regulatory programs may be changed by the co-option of new upstream regulators or by the employment of new downstream gene targets, thus placing existing networks in a novel context. This idea is supported by in situ hybridization data that shows the conservation of the neural plate border specifiers in protochordates, which suggest that part of the neural crest precursor network was present in a common ancestor to the chordates. In some non-vertebrate chordates such as tunicates a lineage of cells (melanocytes) has been identified, which are similar to neural crest cells in vertebrates. This implies that a rudimentary neural crest existed in a common ancestor of vertebrates and tunicates.\n\nEctomesenchyme (also known as Mesectoderm): odontoblasts, dental papillae, the chondrocranium (nasal capsule, Meckel's cartilage, scleral ossicles, quadrate, articular, hyoid and columella), tracheal and laryngeal cartilage, the dermatocranium (membranous bones), dorsal fins and the turtle plastron (lower vertebrates), pericytes and smooth muscle of branchial arteries and veins, tendons of ocular and masticatory muscles, connective tissue of head and neck glands (pituitary, salivary, lachrymal, thymus, thyroid) dermis and adipose tissue of calvaria, ventral neck and face\n\nEndocrine cells:\nchromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, glomus cells type I/II.\n\nPeripheral nervous system:\nSensory neurons and glia of the dorsal root ganglia, cephalic ganglia (VII and in part, V, IX, and X), Rohon-Beard cells, some Merkel cells in the whisker, \nSatellite glial cells of all autonomic and sensory ganglia, Schwann cells of all peripheral nerves.\n\nEnteric cells:\nEnterochromaffin cells.\n\nMelanocytes and iris muscle and pigment cells, and even associated with some tumors (such as melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy).\n\n\n"}

Although undoubtedly a descendant of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, his claimed titles and official membership in the former Imperial House were disputed by those who maintained that his parents' marriage violated the laws of Imperial Russia.\n\nPrince Nicholas was born in Cap d'Antibes near Antibes, France, the eldest son of Prince Roman Petrovich and his wife Princess Praskovia Dmitrievna (née Countess Sheremeteva). Prince Nicholas had a younger brother, Prince Dimitri Romanovich. Their father Prince Roman Petrovich was the only son of Grand Duke Peter Nicolaievich and Grand Duchess Militsa Nikolaievna (née Princess of Montenegro). His grandfather was the younger son of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich and Grand Duchess Alexandra Petrovna (née Duchess of Oldenburg). His great grandfather Nicholas Nikolaevich was a younger son of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia and Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna (née Princess Charlotte of Prussia) and founded the Nikolaevichi branch of the Russian Imperial Family.\n\nPrince Nicholas was brought up in Cap d'Antibes with his family still using the Julian calendar and he spoke both fluent Russian and French from his childhood on. He was brought up in a Russian environment with his local church having a Russian priest and his family employing Russian staff and a Russian nanny.\n\nPrince Nicholas received a private education in France with his studies following the old Russian school curriculum. In 1936 his family moved to Italy due to the standard of schooling supposedly being better there. He aspired to be a naval officer and had convinced his parents by the age of 12 that this was his dream. However, as he was a Romanov and there was a Soviet Navy and not an Imperial Russian Navy, he decided to work towards a career in the Italian Navy. Using his family's close relationship to the Italian Royal Family (both his grandmother Militsa and Queen Helena of Italy, wife of King Victor Emmanuel III, were daughters of King Nicholas I of Montenegro) he began to study in Italy under the tutelage of a retired Italian Naval officer with the aim of attending the Naval Academy of Livorno. However, Nicholas's hopes of a Naval career evaporated when he showed signs of near-sightedness.\n\nHe completed his education in Italy graduating from a Liceo classico in 1942.\n\nDuring World War II, Prince Nicholas and his family lived at the residence of Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. When the King left Rome, Nicholas and his family went into hiding for nine months. During the occupation of Rome by Germany, Nicholas's grandmother, who was at great risk of deportation as a sister of the Queen, had to take shelter in the Holy See. In 1942, the ruling Fascists in Italy approached Prince Nicholas to offer him the throne of Montenegro. He declined.\n\nPrince Nicholas wanted to study engineering at the University of Rome but the war prevented this, so following its conclusion, he found employment by working as a civilian for the Allies in the Psychological Warfare Division and the United States Information Service. On the advice of King Umberto II Prince Nicholas and his family left Italy for Egypt in 1946. While living in Egypt he was involved in the purchasing and sale of Turkish tobacco as well as finding work in an insurance company.\n\nReturning to Europe in 1950 Prince Nicholas worked in Rome for the Austin Motor Company until 1954. Following the death of his brother-in-law he took over the management of his wife's property and business in Tuscany. The business was a large farm which he managed for 25 years from 1955 to 1980 where he bred Chianina cattle and produced wine. He sold the farm in 1982 and moved to Rougemont, Switzerland. A refugee from birth, Prince Nicholas was a stateless person and used to travel abroad on a letter issued by the King of Greece. He finally became a citizen of Italy in 1988. Prince Nicholas visited Russia for the first time in June 1992 when he acted as a second tour guide for a group of businessmen. He often appeared in the media to talk about the Romanovs, giving over 100 television interviews, and appearing in television documentaries such as the 2003 Danish documentary \"\"En Kongelig familie\"\" and the 2007 France 3 produced documentary called \"\"Un nom en héritage, les Romanov\"\". In 1999, a documentary on his life was produced by the Russian television channel NTV.\n\nHis father Roman Petrovich came up with the idea of a family association of the Romanovs in the mid-1970s. After looking through the papers of his father, who died in 1978, Nicholas found that everything was in place for its creation. He then wrote to all the members of the Romanov family who had been in communication with his father and it was agreed that a family association should be created. A year later, in 1979, the Romanov Family Association was officially formed with Prince Dmitri Alexandrovich as president and Nicholas as vice-president. When Vasili Alexandrovich became president in 1980, Nicholas remained vice-president.\n\nIn 1989, after the death of Vasili Alexandrovich, Prince Nicholas was elected the new president of the Romanov Family Association. The Association currently has as members the majority of the male-line descendants of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia, although Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna has never joined, nor did her late father Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich.\n\nThe official position of the Romanov Family Association is that the rights of the family to the Russian Throne were suspended when Emperor Nicholas II abdicated for himself and for his son Tsarevich Alexei in favour of his brother Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich who then deferred ascending the Throne until a Constituent Assembly ratified his rule. Emperor Michael II, as he was legally pronounced by Nicholas II, did not abdicate but empowered the Provisional Government to rule. Michael's \"reign\" was ended with his execution in 1918.\n\nPrince Nicholas considered that following the death of Grand Duke Vladimir Cyrillovich in 1992 that he was head of the House of Romanov and his rightful successor. On the basis that Vladimir Cyrillovich was the last male dynast and all other Romanovs are excluded due to their parents' \"unequal\" marriages, Vladimir's daughter Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna also put forward a claim to the headship of the imperial house on her father's death. With the exception of Grand Duchess Maria, Prince Nicholas was recognized by the rest of the family as head of the Imperial House. However, the final edition of the \"Almanach de Gotha\" published by Justus Perthes, in 1944, stated that the marriage of Nicholas's parents was \"not in conformity with the laws of the house\" although some previous editions had listed him as a dynastic member of the Imperial House. Prince Nicholas said regarding \"unequal\" marriages in the Imperial Family:\n\nOur parents married commoners. So what? We have married commoners. Again, so what? There was nobody to ask us to renounce our rights, so we married without renouncing them, and we and our children still have rights to the throne of Russia.\n\nPrince Nicholas led the Romanov family at the funeral in St. Petersburg of the last Russian Emperor Nicholas II and his family in July 1998. As head of the family he was also present at the reburial of the remains of the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna in Russia in September 2006. Prince Nicholas and his brother Prince Dmitri had been responsible for lobbying the Danish royal family and the Russian President Vladimir Putin to allow the transfer of the Dowager Empress's remains to Russia so they could be buried alongside her husband Emperor Alexander III.\n\nUntil his marriage to a Roman Catholic, Prince Nicholas was in the line of succession to the British throne through his descent from Nicholas the First's wife Charlotte of Prussia, a descendant of George I of Great Britain.\n\nIn 1950, Prince Nicholas and the Countess Sveva della Gherardesca (born 1930), a member of the Italian della Gherardesca noble family from Tuscany and a direct descendant of Count Ugolino della Gherardesca, met at a party in Rome. They were married in Florence in a civil ceremony on 31 December 1951 followed by a religious ceremony on 21 January 1952 in the Russian Cathedral at Cannes.\n\nPrince Nicholas and his wife had three daughters:\n\nPrince Nicholas and his wife lived in Rougemont, Switzerland, for seven months every year, usually in the winter. During the rest of the year they stayed in Italy with their daughters. The prince still used the Julian calendar and was fluent in French, Russian, Italian and English. He was also able to read Spanish.\n\nPrince Nicholas's death in Tuscany aged 91 was reported on 15 September 2014. He was survived by his wife, their three children, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.\n\n\nSince the Russian Revolution, members of the Romanov family have tended to drop the territorial designation \"of Russia\" and use a princely title with the surname Romanov. However this title, and even his right to the surname Romanov are disputed.\n\nHe is also known as \"Prince Nicholas Romanov\", \"Prince Nicholas of Russia\", \"Prince Nicholas Romanoff\", and \"Prince Nikolai Romanov\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2006548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006548", "title": "Conga (music)", "text": "Conga (music)\n\nThe term conga refers to the music groups within Cuban comparsas and the music they play. Comparsas are large ensembles of musicians, singers and dancers with a specific costume and choreography which perform in the street carnivals of Santiago de Cuba and Havana.\n\nThe instrumentation differs between congas santiagueras and congas habaneras. \"Congas santiagueras\" include the \"corneta china\" (Chinese cornet), which is an adaptation of the Cantonese suona introduced in Oriente in 1915, and its percussion section comprises bocúes (similar to African ashiko drums), the quinto (highest pitched conga drum), galletas and the pilón, as well as brakes which are struck with metal sticks. \"Congas habaneras\" lack the \"corneta china\" but include trumpets, trombones and saxophones, and they have a different set of percussion instruments: redoblantes (side drums), bombos (bass drums), quinto, tumbadora (the lowest pitched conga drum), and metallic idiophones such as cowbells, spoons, frying pans and rims.\n\nCongas and comparsas have a long history which dates back to the 19th century, with musical traditions being passed down from one generation to the next. The older comparsas are derived from \"cabildos de nación\" or other social groups, whereas the later ones, called \"paseos\", are derived from \"barrios\" (neighbourhoods). The music of the congas has become a genre itself, being introduced into Cuban popular music in the early 20th century by artists such as Eliseo Grenet and Armando Oréfiche and his Havana Cuban Boys. They have been present for decades in the repertoire of many conjuntos, Cuban big bands and descarga ensembles, also having an influence on modern genres such as salsa and songo. The conga drum, also known in Cuba as tumbadora, took its name from the \"congas de comparsa\".\n\nThe history of the conga (also known as comparsa conga or conga de comparsa) is obscure and its origins remain largely unknown. In the early 19th century, although the word \"conga\" is not found in written sources, there are references to \"tumbas\", and, according to Brea and Millet (1993:204), \"tumba\" refers to the percussion ensemble of the conga. \"Tumba\" is mentioned in connection with \"mamarrachos\" (summer festivals in Santiago de Cuba) as early as 1847 (Pérez I 1988:54). A word that may be synonymous with \"tumba\" is the word \"tango\", mentioned as early as 1856 (Pérez I 1988:79). Unfortunately, most 19th-century writers were extremely negative towards Afro-Cuban culture and little information about the tumbas or tangos was recorded.\n\n\"Congo\" was the word used to designate African slaves brought to Cuba from the Congo region of Africa (currently the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola). According to the rules of Spanish grammar, \"congo\" became a masculine noun/adjective and its feminine counterpart was formed by changing final \"o\" to \"a.\" This Spanish noun/adjective pair has been used in Cuba to designate anything pertaining to the above-mentioned African slaves and their culture. Therefore, some have assumed that \"\"conga\"\" was originally an adjective (as in the expression \"comparsa conga\"), and that the \"comparsa\" was dropped and \"conga\" changed to a noun (del Carmen et al. 2005).\nHowever, the word \"conga\" may also derive from either \"maconga\" (song) or \"nkunga\" (song, sound) in \"the language of the Congo\" (Ortiz 1924:118).\n\nOrtiz (II 1952-5:34) also states that the drum called bokú (one of the instruments of the conga) is \"...typical of the congos.\" Goodman mentions the “\"comparsa conga\"” in conjunction with a \"carnaval\" figure known as “\"el Rey del Congo\"” (the \"King of the Congo”), which seems to confirm a \"kongo\" ethnic connection to the \"conga\" (Pérez I 1988:104). Also, the word \"bokú\" means “drum” in Kikongo (Orovio 1981:58).\n\nIn the early years after the establishment of the Republic of Cuba in 1902, there were numerous decrees by successive mayors of Santiago de Cuba banning \"African drums and \"tangos\"\". (Pérez I 1988:177, etc.) Apparently, these decrees were not faithfully enforced:\n\n“In spite of the prohibitive proclamation, the \"tumbas\" echoed loudly everywhere, including in the most central and heavily-traveled areas.\n\nAccording to Pérez,\n\n“Although the prohibition of African manifestations was reiterated, the \"comparsas\" were permitted. In reality, it was just a question of maintaining on paper that which could not really be enforced due to the express desire of the \"bourgeoisie\", to whom these manifestations were a diversion, ‘something colorful’ and amusing.” (Pérez I 1988:179, note 13)\n\nOpponents to the \"conga\" in print outnumbered defenders. The \"conga\" was a thing of the illiterate Afro-Cuban working people, while the writers of editorials and angry letters to the editor were upper-class Hispano-Cubans. One prominent attacker of the \"conga\", and perhaps the most florid in his prose, was the long-time mayor of Santiago, Desiderio Arnaz (father of American TV star Desi Arnaz), who expressed the feelings of some upper-class Cubans in a newspaper article of 1925:\n\n“I will have you know that the initial days of our traditional masquerades – which have just passed – have left painful impressions in my mind. Allow me to explain. In every way, the carnival has been a joyful celebration of the soul of the people, an exhibition of good artistic taste, a competition of original ideas, a contest in which thought and action have always vied in giving objective form to the perfect conception of Beauty and towards the noble intent of the dignification of society; Paris, Rome, Venice, Madrid and Havana itself offer in their \"carnestolendas\" lessons on how complaisant liberty ought to be used in those periods of fantasy in order to educate the wishes and aspirations of the citizen. But here, in our city, in one of those scientifically inexplicable regressions towards a dark past, certain elements of our commonwealth seem committed – under the pretext of \"carnaval\" – to the repugnant task of checking human progress and causing harm to Civilization with their excesses.\n\nI refer to the ‘\"conga\",’ that strident group of drums, frying pans and shrieks, to whose sounds epileptic, ragged, semi-nude crowds run about the streets of our metropolis, and who, between lubricous contortions and abrupt movements, show a lack of respect to society, offend morality, discredit our customs, lower us in the eyes of people from other countries and, what is worse, by their example, contaminate schoolchildren, who I have seen carried away by the heat of the lesson, panting and sweaty, engaging in frenetic competitions in corporal flexibility in those shameful tourneys of licentiousness.” (Pérez I 1988:337)\n\nOn the other hand, an opinion poll of 1936 on the \"conga\" elicited the following comments:\n“…Let the hours, the minutes and the seconds pass as they will, as long as they do so as quickly as possible so that I can slap that \"bocú\"... From today, it is only 18 days until the \"carnaval\" starts. How it torments me to think that there are still so many days to go; I wish it were tomorrow;... I want you to know... that the sound of the \"conga\" nourishes me, the sound of the frying pans gives me life and the sound of the \"bocú\" drives me crazy. Several days prior to the beginning of rehearsals, I went to see a doctor; I felt overwhelmed, sad, pensive. He prescribed and gave me some injections, and I felt absolutely no different, but as soon as I heard the sound of the first \"bocú\", I was completely cured, I felt strong and ready for anything. And I advise those who are unhappy and listless to get an invigorating injection of \"bocú\", \"conga\" and frying pans and you’ll be OK in 24 hours.” (Pérez II 1988:22-3)\n\nLos Hoyos is a district in downtown Santiago de Cuba and home to the conga of Los Hoyos. The date of the founding of this \"conga\" is unknown, but it was already in existence in 1902 (del Carmen et al. 2005).\n\nAt first, the instruments of the group were a \"pilón\", some \"bocúes\", a cowbell and a \"güiro\". Later, two \"redoblantes\" were added, the number of \"bocúes\" was increased and the cowbell and \"güiro\" were replaced by frying pans. Later still, the frying pans were replaced by the \"campanas\" (automobile brake drums or other pieces of metal chosen for their distinct sound qualities). Also added were the \"quinto\" and the \"requinto\". Los Hoyos first began using a \"corneta china\" in 1916 (del Carmen et al. 2005), one year after the instrument was introduced by the conga Los Colombianos from Tívoli.\n\nDuring the \"carnaval\" season, Los Hoyos performs a traditional event known as an \"\"invasión\",\" in which it marches around the streets of Santiago and visits the neighborhoods where the other famous \"congas\" are located. This \"\"invasión\"\" commemorates the invasion of the Army of Liberation at the end of the War of Independence. Los Hoyos also closes the traditional parades of the \"Carnaval\" of Santiago de Cuba (del Carmen et al. 2005).\n\nWalter Goodman (1838–1912), an Englishman who lived in Santiago de Cuba from 1864 to 1869, left what may be the earliest written description of the instruments of the \"conga\": “… an odd orchestra composed of drums, frying pans, tin utensils, graters and \"güiros\" (Pérez I 1988:102).\"\n\nThe present-day instruments fall into four categories. First are the \"campanas\" (Brea and Millet 1993:181), which are instruments of metal struck with metal beaters. Preferably, brake drums from older model American vehicles (1950s or older) are used. Originally, before brake drums were available, frying pans were used (Pérez I 1988:310, Pérez II 1988:23, etc.) and possibly plow blades as well (Pérez I 1988:106 and 134).\n\nThe second category is the \"bocuses\" (sing. \"bocú\" alt. pl. \"bocúes\"), also called \"fondos\" (\"bottoms\").“The \"bokú\" is a single-headed drum, skin nailed to the shell, shell open at one end, long, shaped like a conic section and made of staves with iron hoops that circle them and hold them together. They are heated with fire and played with both hands and no sticks. The musician or \"bokusero\" carries the drum on his left side, hung over the shoulder with a strap.” (Ortíz II 1952-5:34) Nowadays, the skin is usually held on by a metal hardware system similar to that of the commercial conga drum. Anywhere from four to 16 \"bocuses\" are used in one \"conga\" (Brea and Millet 1993:179). The \"bocuses\" play simple interlocking parts with few variations (however, the sum of the parts results in quite a complex drum melody). A smaller \"bocú,\" called a \"quinto\" or \"bocusito,\" plays complex off-beat figures and improvisations.\n\nAccording to Ortiz, the \"bocú\" was adopted by the \"conga\" when African drums were banned in the early years of the Republic.“The fact that the modern Cuban \"bokú\" originates and is found only in the cities of Oriente, permits one to suppose that the \"bokú\", with or without exact Bantu morphological antecedents, is an unusual type of drum in Cuba; but was adopted by the Cubans when, upon the prohibition of African drums, they resorted to new types of drums which, due to their unaccustomed appearances, were not imputable to Africans.”(Ortíz II 1952-5:36)\n\nA third category are the bimembranophone \"tambores\" (Brea and Millet 1993:200), mentioned in documents as early as 1916 (Pérez I 1988:217) There are three \"tambores\": one \"requinto\" and two \"galletas\". The \"requinto\" (Brea and Millet 1993:198), first mentioned in writing as early as 1931 (Pérez II 1988:9), is shaped somewhat like a snare drum- about 50% wider than it is tall. It is hung from the left shoulder with the top of the drum slightly skewed to the left and is played with a stick on the right-hand skin while the left hand mutes or opens the left-hand skin. Its part is simple with few variations. The \"galletas\" (also called \"congas\"- Orovio 1981:186) are like bass drums, but flatter. They are both played with a stick in a manner similar to the \"requinto\", except that they are hung from the shoulders in such a way that the skins are nearly horizontal to the ground. The higher pitched of the two is called a \"redoblante\" (Brea and Millet 1993:197). It measures approximately 2 feet in diameter and 5 inches high. In addition to its basic pattern, there are many \"floreos\" (variations) that it can play. The lower-pitched \"galleta\" is called a \"pilón\" (Brea and Millet 1993:196) or \"pilonera\" (Ortíz II 1952-5:242). It measure about 2 inches larger in each dimension than the \"redoblante.\" This drum plays a basic pattern with few variations. All three of the drums utilize a metal hardware system for attaching the skins to the drum shells.\n\nAs with the \"bocú\", Ortiz asserts that the \"tambores\" were not originally used in the pre-Republican \"congas\". “One is soon aware that these \"congas\" [\"galletas\"], like the drums of the \"comparsa carabalí\", are ‘white’ imitations of drums whose African morphology has been disguised” (Ortíz II 1952-5:242).\n\nThe final category includes only one item: the \"trompetica china\" or \"corneta china\" (literally “Chinese trumpet/bugle”). This double reed instrument, called \"suona\" in Chinese, was brought to Havana in the 19th century by Chinese immigrants. It was being used to play traditional Chinese music in the Chinese theaters in Havana's Chinatown, when an Afro-Cuban \"comparsa\" named “Los Chinos Buenos” adapted it to use in place of an \"inspirador\" (\"lead singer\"). Although it was very difficult for anyone not standing within ten feet of the \"inspirador\" to hear him or her singing during a street performance, the \"trompetica china\", due to its peculiar raucous and nasal sound, could usually be heard by the entire \"comparsa\" and its followers. In 1910, the \"trompetica china\" was brought to Santiago de Cuba by soldiers of the Cuban army (Ortíz II 1952-5:451). The first \"conga\" to incorporate its use was Paso Franco in 1915 (del Carmen et al. 2005). By 1924, it was a well-established feature of the \"conga\" (Pérez; I 1988:310). Today, the sound of this instrument is recognized by Cubans as the symbol of the \"carnavales\" of Oriente.\n\nThe \"conga\" is danced with small sliding steps, advancing alternately. Imagining two measures of time (the traditional time signature for the \"conga\"), if the right foot starts on the first eighth note of the first measure, then the left foot steps on the third eighth note of the first measure, the right again on the first eighth note of the second measure, the left on the third eighth note of the second measure, and so on. This basic step is called the \"\"arrollao.\"\" The arms are bent at the elbow and swung opposite to the rhythm of the feet (Fernández 1974:91).\n\nThere are many variations on the basic step, as well as simple figures such as \"kick,\" \"single turn,\" \"cutting sugar cane,\" \"shining shoes,\" etc.\n\nA common variation on the above variation is to eliminate the tie.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Four years later his family moved to North Miami, Florida. When young, Rosenhaus was a fan of the Miami Dolphins and attended home games and practices.\n\nIn 1987, he graduated from the University of Miami and began law school at Duke University. In 1990, he graduated from Duke University School of Law.\n\nIn 1989, Rosenhaus became a registered sports agent and at the age of 22, he was the youngest registered sports agent at the time. As a University of Miami alumnus, many of his clients and contacts came from the Miami Hurricanes football program.\n\nHis company operates under the name Rosenhaus Sports Representation (RSR). Other principals in the firm include Vice President Jason Rosenhaus (Drew's brother) and director of marketing Robert Bailey.\n\nAfter the 2011 NFL Lockout, Rosenhaus negotiated more than 90 contracts, worth about $600 million, in one month.\n\nIn 2012, Rosenhaus and his brother Jason were accused of breach of contract and fraud by suspended employee Daniel F. Martoe in an arbitration filing with the National Football League Players Association. At the same time the NFLPA investigated the agency for persuading a number of former players to invest in a failed Alabama casino and for mismanaging former client's checks.\n\nRosenhaus represents more than 170 players, including several high-profile clients, many of which are known for having eccentric personalities. Notable players Rosenhaus has represented or represents include Antonio Brown, Chad Johnson, Frank Gore, Rex Grossman, Rob Gronkowski, LeSean McCoy, Jimmy Smith, Plaxico Burress, Terrell Owens, Tyreek Hill, and Warren Sapp.\n\nIn January 2003, University of Miami running back Willis McGahee suffered a knee injury in his final college game during the Fiesta Bowl, the national championship game that year. One month later, he signed with Rosenhaus who predicted that, despite the injury, McGahee would be a first-round NFL draft pick in the 2003 NFL Draft.\n\nDuring the draft, cameras would cut to live shots of McGahee and Rosenhaus talking on their cell phones, giving the impression that they were communicating with teams. The Buffalo Bills picked McGahee in the first round as the 23rd overall choice in the draft. After reconstructive surgery and physical rehabilitation, McGahee signed a five-year contract with the Bills worth about $16 million.\n\nAfter the 2005 Terrell Owens controversy with the Philadelphia Eagles, Rosenhaus attended a press conference with the client. Rosenhaus responded to the majority of journalists' inquiries by asking for the \"next question.\" The incident contributed to the title of Rosenhaus's second book \"Next Question: An NFL Super Agent's Proven Game Plan for Business Success\".\n\nIn March 2016, after his previous agent terminated their contract, Rosenhaus began to represent Johnny Manziel on the condition he seeks treatment for substance abuse. On April 19, after only representing Manziel for a month, Rosenhaus ended his contract with Manziel because he never met his deadline to seek treatment.\n\nRosenhaus is the author of two books. The first is his autobiography \"A Shark Never Sleeps: Wheeling and Dealing with the NFL's Most Ruthless Agent\", published in 1997. The second book, published in 2008, is \"Next Question : An NFL Super Agent's Proven Game Plan for Business Success\".

The title was only contestable by male individual wrestlers. Being a professional wrestling championship, it was not won legitimately; it was instead won via a scripted ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline. \n\nOn October 13, 1970, the championship was introduced as the NWA Eastern Heavyweight Championship during a taping of \"Championship Wrestling.\" It was announced that the Missouri Mauler had defeated the defending champion Pat O'Connor in New York City to win the title; this title change was fictitious and a storyline to introduce the championship to the promotion; nevertheless, O'Connor's reign is denoted as the first official reign. Because it was fictitious, further information regarding O'Connor's reign is unavailable.\n\nOn the September 6, 1973 taping of \"Championship Wrestling\", JCP owner Jim Crockett, Jr. announced the retirement of the NWA Eastern Heavyweight Championship and the establishment of the NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship. At the time of this change, Jerry Brisco was in his fourth reign as the NWA Eastern Heavyweight Champion, and as a result of never losing the title, he was recognized as the first NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Champion. Because Brisco's fourth reign did not end, being awarded the NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Title is not counted as a new reign overall in the title's history. By 1974, JCP was also known as \"Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling\" (MACW), which is why all of its championships included \"Mid-Atlantic\" in their names.\n\nOn December 26, 1986, Ron Garvin, after winning JCP's version of the NWA United States Tag Team Championship with Barry Windham, vacated the NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship and handed the belt to Crockett, Jr. on a taping of \"World Championship Wrestling\". Crockett, Jr. deactivated the championship for unknown reasons, and eventually, JCP was sold to Ted Turner in 1988, thus becoming the new promotion, World Championship Wrestling.<ref name=\"WCW/JCP\"></ref> \n\nIn the late 1990s, NWA gave a group of promoters permission to establish a territory called \"Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling\"; however, this territory has not claimed any connection to the original JCP/MACW. As a result, their prime championship, called the MACW Heavyweight Championship, has no connection to this original championship or its lineage.\n\nOverall, there were 63 reigns among 29 wrestlers. Fifteen of those reigns occurred while the title was called the \"NWA Eastern Heavyweight Championship\" while 46 reigns occurred under the \"NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship\" name. Johnny Valentine ranks first in combined reigns by the length of 504 days with 2 reigns total. Wahoo McDaniel had the most reigns with seven. Ken Patera's second reign was the longest in the title's history at 334 days. All title changes occurred at JCP–promoted events: live events, pay-per-view events, and on televised events that aired on broadcast delay.\n\n\n\n"}

It was directed by Sidney Gilliat and stars Alastair Sim, Trevor Howard, Sally Gray and Rosamund John. The film was shot at Pinewood Studios in England. The title is a reference to the colour-coding used on the gas canisters used by anaesthetists.\n\nIn August 1944, during the V-1 doodlebug offensive on London, patient Joseph Higgins (Marriott) dies on the operating table in a rural British hospital in the southeast of England. The anaesthetist, Barney Barnes (Howard), has had a patient die in similar circumstances previously, and when Sister Bates (Campbell) is killed after revealing that the death of Higgins was not an accident, Inspector Cockrill (Sim) is asked to investigate. Cockrill's investigation is hampered by the conflict between Barnes and Mr Eden (Genn) because of their competition for the affections of Nurse Linley (Gray). After a murder attempt is directed at Linley, the inspector restages the operation in order to unmask the murderer.\n\n\nAccording to trade papers, the film was a \"notable box office attraction\" at British cinemas in 1947. The film has also been highly praised by critics. Leslie Halliwell noted that it was a 'classic comedy-thriller, with serious detection balanced by excellent jokes and performances, also by moments of fright'. \n\nThe Criterion Collection released Green for Danger on laserdisc in 1993 with optional audio commentary by Bruce Eder. Home Vision Cinema released it on VHS at the same time. Criterion released the film on DVD in 2007 with Eder's commentary and a 2007 interview documentary produced by Heather Shaw, \"Geoff Brown on \"Green for Danger\"\" (Brown being the author of a book on the work of Gilliat and Launder).

It is the sequel to an earlier game named \"Chagunitzu\". \"Paganitzu\" was published in three episodes: \"Romancing the Rose\",\"The Silver Dagger,\" and \"Jewel of the Yucatan.\" The first was made available as shareware. In 2015, it was re-released on Steam with Microsoft Windows and macOS support.\n\nThis game builds more closely on the Adventures of Lolo series (alias \"Eggerland\", first volume in Japan in 1987) than directly on Sokoban. For example, the snake that has to be blocked horizontally is a very recurring element of Lolo. Another contemporary game series of the same kind is Bolo Adventures (first volume in 1992), a shareware by William Soleau.\n\nThe protagonist and player character of \"Paganitzu\" is Alabama \"Al\" Smith (an obvious nod to Indiana \"Indy\" Jones), working his way through an ancient Aztec pyramid.\n\nThe object of the game is to collect all the keys in a level to unlock the exit and try not to get killed by monsters and traps. However the object of the third episode is to reach the statue with the yellow stone. Each episode has 20 levels, but episode 3 has one more playable level and four secret unplayable levels from Chagunitzu. Treasures can be collected for points and special encounters can be found for 5000 points each. Some of the walls can be walked into to reveal secret passages. Dirt can be uncovered and rocks can be pushed around. Rocks pushed into water, lava or slime turn the spot into solid terrain. Each episode has different puzzles and enemy tackling.\n\nSpiders can be killed by being cloistered in one square, which destroys anything but walls and Alabama around them and leaves behind some gems. If water pipes are destroyed the water will stop flowing. Certain spots teleport Alabama around the level. One trap Alabama will frequently face are spears that elongate and try to plunge into Alabama. Those traps can be disarmed by hitting something else that gets in their path as they elongate. Once disarmed, they block a certain amount of space. Also there are snakes that spit fire horizontally if Alabama crosses their path and to pass them, they must have an item, spider or boulder blocking their view. One unique puzzle requires Alabama to shed some light in a dark level before it can be completed.\n\nEnemies in this episode cannot be killed and must be avoided at all costs. Levers in many of the levels can be pulled to switch flame traps on and off. One unique puzzle requires Alabama to pull a set of levers in the correct sequence.\n\nSkeleton Lizards are completely harmless enemies that only obstruct Alabama. There are living pods that fire projectiles horizontally and vertically and must be dealt with in the same manner as the snakes. Throughout the levels Alabama will encounter statues with different functions. A statue with a yellow stone is used to exit to the next level. A statue with green arrows can be passed uni-directionally either horizontally or vertically. A statue with a blue stone is used to invert the arrows of a green statue. A statue with a red stone is used to remove one part of water. One unique puzzle requires Alabama to navigate through a maze of invisible walls.\n\n"}

{"id": "2006623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006623", "title": "Film Threat", "text": "Film Threat\n\nFilm Threat is an online publication, and earlier, a national magazine that focused primarily on independent film, although it also reviewed videos and DVDs of mainstream films, as well as Hollywood movies in theaters. It first appeared as a photocopied zine in 1985, created by Wayne State University students Chris Gore and André Seewood. In 1997, \"Film Threat\" was converted to a solely online resource.\n\nThe initial issues of \"Film Threat\" combined pseudopolitical ranting by Seewood and cinematic material and parody of mainstream film by Gore. In Gore’s own words, \"I thought, wouldn’t it be great to start a punk rock-attitude movie magazine—and then, the people from this magazine would eventually go off and make films. Wouldn’t it be great?\"\n\nIn issue 9, \"Film Threat\" became a printed magazine, and also around this time, Seewood left the project to pursue independent filmmaking and to write seriously about the cinema. This second life of \"Film Threat\" included such classic moments as Gore and “Square Dance Instructor” Paul Zimmerman getting kicked out of the 1988 Toronto Festival of Festivals, only to return the following year under fake names representing a fake publication, \"Film Forum\". In issue 18, San Francisco State student David E. Williams wrote in, sparking a friendship with Gore that led to both of them relocating to Los Angeles in summer 1989 to work on the growing magazine.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, \"Film Threat\" was transformed as Gore attempted to find a more mainstream release for the magazine, while its new offshoot \"Film Threat Video Guide\", edited by Williams, continued to focus on the underground films and filmmakers that the magazine had featured in its early days. \"Film Threat\" eventually found a new home with Larry Flynt Publications (LFP), relaunching in November, 1991 as Volume 2, Issue 1. \"I darted to the newsstand to grab the first glossy edition of what promised to be the turning of the tide for 'Let’s-Blow-and-Stroke-the-Interviewee' type film journalism. And whose face did I see? Macaulay Culkin’s,\" stated filmmaker Kevin Smith of the first issue of \"Film Threat\"’s new edition.\n\nIn 1993, the magazine—then published bimonthly—had a circulation of 125,000, and was competing with such titles as \"Premiere\". Paul Zimmerman became executive editor in 1994, and the magazine continued to grow, but \"Film Threat\"'s tenure with Larry Legend Publications ended after 28 issues in February of 1493.\n\nGore managed to buy back the rights from LFP, and launched the magazine, for a third time, in December 1996. He printed only two issues, however, before retiring the magazine in 1997.\n\nGore launched \"Film Threat\" as a website in 1996. At first a sparse collection of film news, FilmThreat.com grew, covering both the indie and mainstream equally. Over the first 14 years of its online life, FilmThreat.com continued in the tradition of its print counterpart, courting controversy—such as when editor Ron Wells wrote a scathing criticism of Harry Knowles.\n\nChris Gore was succeeded as editor of the website by Ron Wells (1997–2003), who was then followed by Eric Campos (2003–6) and then Mark Bell (2006–8). Over the course of 2009, the site was edited by Don R. Lewis and Matthew Sorrento, before a brief hiatus where the site went offline in December 2009. On January 25, 2010, during the Sundance Film Festival, Gore sold the website and rights to the magazine to former editor Bell, who then relocated \"Film Threat\" to New Jersey and relaunched the website on February 23, 2010.\n\nOn May 11, 2011, \"Film Threat\" announced that it planned to produce a quarterly print and e-book edition beginning in September 2011, relying upon crowdfunding for the resources. The campaign to return \"Film Threat\" to print raised only $5,111 of its $60,000 crowd-funding goal (based on two coinciding $30000 campaigns, one of which was cancelled on June 11), and were unsuccessful in its attempt to raise the necessary monies by the conclusion of the crowdfunding campaign.\n\nIn 2011, \"Film Threat\" instituted a for-profit \"unsolicited submission\" service charging independent filmmakers a fee who wish to have their work reviewed by the site. However, \"Film Threat\" still reviewed select films that are part of the site's regular coverage for free.\n\nIn 2015, Chris Gore reacquired \"Film Threat\" and took the site offline, seeking to reboot the Film Threat brand with a \"Save Film Threat…\" crowd-funding attempt at Kickstarter, which ran from March 19 to April 22; the attempt failed, with pledges totaling $63,725 falling short of the goal of $125,000.\nIn late August 2016, Chris Gore started another Kickstarter campaign to save/revamp the website with a more modest goal of $37,500. The campaign brought in $56,199 (against the stretch goal of $50,000, enabling the production of a documentary about \"Film Threat\".)\n\nOn February 6, 2017, the \"Film Threat\" website was relaunched.\n\nA relaunch party celebrating the website's return was held in Los Angeles on January 14, 2017, at The Berrics.\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 4, 2003. Santa's little helper's original owner who abandoned him at the racetrack makes his first appearance since the episode Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\".\n\nBart and his friends in his treehouse try to eavesdrop on Lisa and her friends having a tea party, and the treehouse gets destroyed in the ensuing fight. After they rip up a railroad and then goof off with their spoils, Marge gets the Amish to build a new treehouse for Bart. However, because the Amish know little about electricity, the faulty electrical work causes a fire at neighborhood a party for the completion of the treehouse, and Homer is trapped inside, semi-conscious. Homer calls for Santa's Little Helper to save him, but Santa's Little Helper refuses and runs away, but not before doubling back to grab a roasted turkey from the flames. However, Snowball II does save Homer, leaping from Lisa’s arms and climbing the treehouse to wake Homer up by scratching him (she tries nudging him gently at first).\n\nDisgusted by Santa’s Little Helper’s cowarice, Homer gets mad at him and calls him a coward. Santa's Little Helper follows Homer everywhere he goes- looking to regain his affection- but Homer shuns him at every opportunity. Snowball II is worshipped as a hero by Springfield. The local dog park is even renamed the \"Snowball II Municipal Cat Park\". During a live interview with Kent Brockman at the park renaming, Homer declares into the camera, “I have no dog!\"\n\nHomer tethers Santa's Little Helper in the backyard with a choke chain while he goes inside with Marge to eat the “emergency ham”, with the intent of making Santa's Little Helper jealous. When Homer leaves an empty beer can in the yard, Santa's Little Helper flips the can into the air, balancing it on his nose and drinking the last few drops. \"Springfield Shopper\" reporter Dave Shutton takes a photo of it that appears on the front page of the newspaper. This gets the attention of Duff Beer, who announce that Duffman will be replaced with Santa's Little Helper, as their new mascot, Suds McDuff.\n\nSuds McDuff boosts sales of Duff Beer, and the family's fortunes explode, causing Homer to embrace Suds for his success. However, this prompts Santa's Little Helper's original sleazy owner and racing trainer (from \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\") to visit the Simpsons and prove that he owns the dog by showing the interview footage of Homer disowning Santa's Little Helper. He becomes Suds' new owner and takes the family's fortunes to himself, much to the Simpsons' discomfort, with Bart breaking down into tears for what his father had done, and Homer is wracked with complete remorse for saying such a horrible thing on TV.\n\nFiguring that if they can get Duffman to replace Suds as the Duff mascot, they can get their dog back, the Simpsons seek Duffman, who has become an ordinary man named Barry Duffman who helps the less fortunate (by teaching math at a local halfway house). The Simpsons ask him to help the family get Santa's Little Helper back at a Duff Beer-sponsored beach volleyball event.\n\nAt the event, Homer pretends to be drowning, while he is actually floating on a keg of beer. Santa's Little Helper is too cowardly, as Homer predicted, to save him. However, when Duffman goes in to save Homer, a shark attacks and Duffman refuses to go in, revealing himself to be a coward too. The shark attempts to bite Homer, but it gets drunk by biting the beer keg. The crowd at the beach likes the shark, and Duff Beer announces that the shark — named Duff McShark — will be their new mascot. Santa's Little Helper gladly returns to the Simpson family.\n\nThe episode title is a reference to the 1957 Disney live-action feature \"Old Yeller\". Santa's Little Helper's alter ego as Suds McDuff is a reference to the old Bud Light mascot Spuds McKenzie.\n\n"}

He is tall with a lean build, and used to wear an Aegean hat.\n\nIn his youth, he seems aware of his good looks and popularity with the girls; perhaps because of this, he sometimes tends to be smug and self-assured. The dismissal of his affections toward the eponymous Anne Shirley, however, seems to ground him, and he matures and is well-liked by many. Throughout the series, Gilbert is depicted as a fair, practical and reliable man, who is inclined to have a \"common sense\" view of things. Keenly intelligent, he has a strong wit and sense of humour.\n\nAs Gilbert matures, he becomes less headstrong and demonstrates a sense of patience and devotion. He eventually becomes a highly respected doctor in the fictional town of Glen St Mary, Prince Edward Island (PEI), where he lives with his wife Anne and their children, and the family's spinster housekeeper, Susan.\n\nGilbert Blythe takes an immediate interest in Anne Shirley upon their first meeting and tries to gain her attention; however, when Anne ignores him, he teasingly calls her \"Carrots\" because of her red hair, unaware of her sensitivity about it. In response, Anne smashes her slate over his head in anger; and despite his attempts to apologize, she refuses to forgive him for several years. Throughout the entire first book, Gilbert repeatedly shows admiration for Anne, but she coldly rebuffs him. She continues her grudge even after he rescues her from the pond after a near-disastrous reenactment of Tennyson's \"Lancelot and Elaine.\" When Anne refuses his offer of friendship after the incident, Gilbert decides to respond in kind and stops openly trying to gain her attention. They develop a strong academic rivalry instead (though the competition is entirely goodnatured on Gilbert's side), and Anne gradually acknowledges Gilbert as an intellectual equal; they eventually compete to win scholarships at Queens Academy.\n\nFollowing his time at Queens, Gilbert decides to teach at the Avonlea school to finance his future college education. When one of Anne's caretakers, Matthew, dies of a heart attack, Anne chooses to give up the Avery Scholarship in order to stay at Green Gables and support his sister Marilla. After learning of Anne's predicament, Gilbert, who has always loved Anne, gives up his position so Anne can teach in Avonlea and live at Green Gables with Marilla. Gilbert goes on to teach at the White Sands School and Anne, after learning of his noble act, finally forgives him and they become good friends.\n\nDuring the two years Anne teaches in Avonlea, Gilbert and Anne become very close. At the end of their teaching 'chapter in life' Anne starts to have stronger feelings towards him, but does not recognize them as love. Gilbert aspires to become a doctor and goes on to study at Redmond College, where he is joined by Anne, freed of personal obligations after the widowed Rachel Lynde moves to Green Gables to keep Marilla company, in \"Anne of the Island\".\n\nGilbert's feelings for Anne become increasingly apparent during their first year of college, while Anne becomes uncomfortable around him because she believes her feelings for Gilbert are entirely platonic as he does not match her idealized notion of true love, which requires a dark, proud, melancholy and over-romanticized hero. However, Anne's jealousy of Gilbert's other potential love interests, her moments of physical attraction for him, and her deep respect and devotion to their friendship suggest that she may be falling in love with him without realizing it.\n\nIn their second year of college, Gilbert proposes but Anne refuses him, saying she doesn't care for him \"in that way\" and that she only wants to be his friend. Disappointed, Gilbert reveals that \"your friendship can't satisfy me, Anne. I want your love -- and you tell me I can never have that\". Their relationship becomes awkward, especially after Anne meets and is courted by fellow Redmond student Roy Gardner, a man who at first seems to personify her \"ideal\", although Anne secretly admits to herself that Roy lacks certain qualities and that she and Roy do not share a mutual sense of humour. Gilbert seems to concede defeat and Anne believes that he has become involved with another student, Christine Stuart, who is later revealed to be only a friend. Instead, he focuses his attention to obtaining the Cooper Prize, a prestigious scholarship that will allow him to attend medical school.\n\nNot long after graduation, Gilbert contracts typhoid fever as a result of physically exhausting himself during school. Anne, who has recently refused a proposal of marriage from Roy Gardner after realizing during his proposal that she does not love Roy, is shocked to learn that Gilbert may die. She realizes that she loves and has always loved him; that \"she belonged to him and he to her\", and recognizes at last that she mistook her \"bond\" to Gilbert for strong friendship instead of love, while her relationship with Roy was merely \"flattered fancy.\"\n\nGilbert recovers from his illness and resumes his friendship with Anne after learning she refused Roy Gardner. He proposes to her again and she accepts. However, they remain engaged for three years, as Gilbert intends to finish his medical course before marrying her; they correspond regularly in their time apart (\"Anne of Windy Poplars\"), while Anne works as a principal at Summerside High School.\n\nThe two marry in \"Anne's House of Dreams\", and move to the town of Glen St. Mary, where Gilbert takes over his uncle's medical practice. He proves to be an excellent and well-respected doctor. Their married life is very happy and they have seven children: Joyce (also called Joy; died as an infant), James Matthew (Jem), Walter (who dies during the First World War), Anne and Diana (twins; also called Nan and Di), Shirley (the youngest boy), and Bertha Marilla (called Rilla).\n\nAs the series ends, it is 1919 and they are happy; Gilbert is 55 and still sincerely in love with Anne of Green Gables.\n\nIn the 1919 film adaption, Gilbert was portrayed by Paul Kelly. In the 1934 film adaption, Gilbert was portrayed by Tom Brown. In the 1940 sequel \"Anne of Windy Poplars\", Gilbert was portrayed by Patric Knowles. In the 1972 BBC TV adaptation, the young Gilbert was played by Robin Halstead, and in the follow-up series, \"Anne of Avonlea\", the adult Gilbert was played by Christopher Blake.\nIn the CBC Television film adaptations of the 1980s, Gilbert Blythe was portrayed by Jonathan Crombie in the CBC Television film adaptations of 1985, 1987, and . In the Japanese anime adaptation of \"Anne of Green Gables\", he is voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue. The CD recording of the musical that has run for more than 40 years at the Charlottetown Festival, focusing on Anne and Gilbert's relationship, features Andrew MacBean as Gilbert. Gilbert was portrayed by Drew Haytaoglu in the 2016 film \"L.M. Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables\". Gilbert is portrayed by Lucas Jade Zumann in the 2017 CBC and Netflix series \"Anne with an E\".Gilbert was also portrayed by Dylan Duff in the 2019 play/film Anne of Green Gables.\n"}

The hero in these two movies was played by Tatsuo Umemiya. The movies were released a week apart. The films were titled:\n\n\nFor TV release in America, these two Planet Prince movies were compiled into a 95-minute movie entitled Prince of Space in 1962. It was also called \"The Star Prince\", \"Planet Prince\" or \"Prince Planet\".\n\nThe TV version looks very similar to Super Giant, in that both wear cowled costumes and capes. Each character also has super powers and flies. The two-part movie version (produced by Toei) is different, as Prince of Space wears a streamlined costume, cape, and helmet. In the edited US version he has no superpowers other than the invulnerability of his costume, but in a subplot unique to the Japanese version he is able to revert a man who was brainwashed by the Ginsei aliens back to a peaceful state. He uses a wand-like laser gun and flies a small spaceship.\n\nIn the TV version, just like Moonlight Mask, the Planet Prince persona was credited as being played by \"?\" (even though he never wore a mask to conceal his face).\n\nIn the film, Prince's enemy is Ambassador Phantom of the Silver Planet (銀星のまぼろし大使) (he also appeared in one of the tv series' story arcs), while in the U.S. version he is called Dictator Phantom of the Planet Krankor. He (along with his henchmen) wears a prosthetic nose and cowl that gives him a decidedly chicken-like appearance, something that is constantly mocked when the film was featured on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". Phantom and his henchmen also don't appear to wear undergarments, as is made painfully obvious in several shots.\n\nA translation error in the English dub has Prince of Space declare \"Your weapons are useless against me!\", implying he is invulnerable to them. In the Japanese version, this line simply had him implying that their weapons were useless because he was capable of \"dodging\" them. The English line leads to confusion as the Prince is constantly shown running away from the lasers in spite of his stated invulnerability.\n\n\"Prince of Space\" was also featured on the nationally syndicated television series \"Cinema Insomnia\". On the show, there is a commercial for the album \"Candles, Krankor and You\" where the Dictator Phantom sings various cover songs to popular music as \"Unforgettable\" and \"Summer Wind\".\n\n\nTheme Song – \"Planet Prince Song\"\n\n\n"}

He ascended the throne in 887, after the death of his father Georgios I, and ruled until 915 or 920, when he was succeeded by his son Zacharias II. Belonging to the Dynasty of Zacharias, little is known about his rule, although it is recorded that at some point between 910 and 915, his kingdom was involved in a war with the Abbasid Caliphate. \n\nGeorgios II lived during the Makurian golden age between the 9th and 11th centuries, when the kingdom reached the peak of its cultural development. He has previously been assumed to have been identical with Georgios I, but it is now clear that he was a king of his own. Georgios II was probably born after the early 860s. He was the grandson of Zacharias I, who, in 835, had founded a new Makurian dynasty, and the son of Georgios I, who had famously travelled to Baghdad in the same year. He also had an unnamed sister, who was married to Nyuti (nephew of Zacharias I), and a younger brother named Zacharias. \n\nThe sources for the reign of Georgios II are limited. What is known is that he became king in 887, after the death of his father. He was married to a woman named Mariam, who bore him a son and eventual successor, Zacharias II. Zacharias II was already consolidating his power during the rule of his father, holding the highest offices of the kingdom (\"protoeparch\" and \"protodomestikos\").\n\nLate in Georgios' reign, between 910 and 915, Nubia was reportedly raided by the Abbasid Emir of Egypt, Takin al-Khazari. It is not entirely clear when Georgios' rule came to an end: a document from Qasr Ibrim suggests that he was succeeded by his son in 915, while a foundation stele from Faras places that event in the year 920.\n\n"}
{"id": "2006643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006643", "title": "Mike Grier", "text": "Mike Grier\n\nMichael James Grier (born January 5, 1975) is an American retired professional ice hockey winger who played for four teams in the National Hockey League (NHL) - the Edmonton Oilers, Washington Capitals, San Jose Sharks, and Buffalo Sabres. Primarily a checking forward, he played 1,060 NHL games over 14 NHL seasons. Grier was the first African-American player in the history of the NHL to be exclusively trained in the country. He currently works as the assistant coach for the New Jersey Devils. He also coached at Saint Sebastian's School, where he played his high school hockey. He also coached his sons Boston Jr. Terriers 03 AAA Team.\n\nHis father is Bobby Grier, who used to be the Associate Director of Pro Personnel for the Houston Texans of the National Football League (NFL). Prior to that, Bobby Grier was a running back coach, director of pro scouting, and vice-president of player personnel for the New England Patriots of the NFL. (The elder Grier should not be confused with the Bobby Grier who broke the color barrier in the 1956 Sugar Bowl.) Mike's brother, Chris currently serves as the general manager for the Miami Dolphins. Another notable athlete in his family is Pro Bowl NFL Defensive Lineman Roosevelt \"Rosey\" Grier.\n\nGrier was raised in Holliston, Massachusetts, where he attended and played hockey at St. Sebastian's School. At age 9 Michael appeared in Sports Illustrated's \"Faces In The Crowd\" section in issue 06-18-84/Vol. 60, No. 25, it read: Michael, 9, a defenseman for the 35-19-8 Holliston Mites in the 7-to-9 year-old division of the Westboro ice hockey league, had 114 goals and 43 assists this season. In 1982-1983 he racked up 113 goals and 104 assists in 52 games.\n\nGrier was originally drafted by the St. Louis Blues in the ninth round (219th overall) of the 1993 NHL Entry Draft, and was considered a long-shot to make an NHL team. He spent his early playing days with Saint Sebastian's School and later with Boston University, culminating in his best amateur season in 1994–95, where he was named a first team all-star. During his time at BU, Grier's NHL rights were dealt to the Edmonton Oilers along with star goaltender Curtis Joseph in exchange for a pair of first round picks.\n\nAfter leaving college, Grier immediately cracked the Oilers lineup as a checking-line right-winger, scoring 32 points and bearing a respectable +7 plus-minus rating. During his time in Edmonton, Grier was best known for provoking Chris Simon of the Washington Capitals in 1997. Grier allegedly made derogatory comments about Simon's Ojibwa heritage, and Simon allegedly responded with a racial slur directed at Grier, and struck him in the head with his stick. Although the spoken words were never confirmed, Simon was suspended three games as a result of using his stick to hit Grier. Grier played six seasons with the Oilers organization, including two in which he scored twenty goals.\n\nOn October 2, 2002, in order to free up roster space, Grier was traded to the Washington Capitals for a pair of draft choices. Incidentally, this put Grier and Simon on the same team for a short time; however, Simon was traded to Chicago after playing 10 games in the 2002–03 season. The Capitals attempted to put a Stanley Cup-caliber team together, primarily built around star forward Jaromír Jágr and goaltender Olaf Kölzig. The team disappointed on the ice, although Grier remained a reliable checking player.\n\nThis didn't last long, however, as Washington traded Grier on March 4, 2004 to the Buffalo Sabres for Czech prospect Jakub Klepiš. Grier finished the season with Buffalo, scoring nine points, but the Sabres failed to make the playoffs. During the 2005–06 NHL season, Grier set a personal record, scoring four game-winning goals for the Sabres and contributing to their run to the 2006 Eastern Conference Finals. Grier was then signed to a free agent deal by the San Jose Sharks, where he recorded 16 goals, including three shorthanded, in his first season with San Jose. He scored nine and 10 goals in his next two seasons with the Sharks, respectively.\n\nOn August 10, 2009, Grier returned to the Buffalo Sabres.\n\nGrier's biggest contribution to the San Jose Sharks and Buffalo Sabres has been his penalty killing ability. San Jose ranked 14th, 1st, and 4th in penalty killing in the three years Grier played with the team. In the 2009–10 season, Buffalo was second overall in the NHL in penalty killing. Grier has been a part of the top penalty killing units for these teams.\n\nGrier is also known for his toughness, separating his shoulder and having it popped back in on numerous occasions before finally electing for surgery.\n\nGrier played his 1000th NHL game on November 3, 2010, against the Boston Bruins, becoming the 254th player in NHL history to reach the milestone. After not being re-signed by Buffalo for the 2011-12 season, Grier officially announced his retirement from the NHL on December 1, 2011.\n\n"}

The school was founded in 1887 as St. Procopius College by the Benedictine monks of St. Procopius Abbey in the Pilsen community on the West Side of Chicago. The institution has retained a close relationship with the Benedictine Order, which bears the name of St. Benedict (480–543 A.D.), the acknowledged father of western monasticism.\n\nThe university resides within the Chicago metropolitan area, and is located near two national research facilities—Argonne National Laboratory and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The university's location in the East-West Tollway corridor provides various internship and employment opportunities for students. It has a branch campus called Benedictine University at Mesa in Mesa, Arizona.\n\nBenedictine University, also called BenU, was founded in 1887 as St. Procopius College by the Benedictine monks of St. Procopius Abbey, who lived in the Pilsen community of Chicago's West Side. The monks created the all-male institution just two years after their community began, with the intention of educating men of Czech and Slovak descent. While the school was called a college from its founding, it did not begin offering post-secondary courses until after it moved from Chicago to rural Lisle in 1901. It became fully accredited in 1957 and, as the area around it transitioned from rural to suburban, it grew substantially. Also in 1957, the institution's high school component began operating independently of the college and is now called Benet Academy. The college became fully coeducational in 1968.\n\nThe school changed its name to Illinois Benedictine College in 1971, and in 1996, it became Benedictine University. While the institution continued to grow in Lisle, it expanded its reach to include campuses in other cities, including Springfield, Illinois, in 2003 and Mesa, Arizona, in 2012. The university added the Kindlon Hall of Learning and the Birck Hall of Science in 2001 and the Neff Alumni Center in 2012, and in 2015, Benedictine opened the Daniel L. Goodwin Hall of Business, which features the Bloomberg Trading Lab and a 600-seat auditorium.\n\nAfter recognizing that there is great demand for American business programs overseas, Benedictine joined forces with Shenyang University of Technology and Shenyang Jianzhu University in China to bring Master of Business Administration and Master of Science in Management Information Systems programs there.\n\n\nBenedictine University offers 59 undergraduate majors through The College of Science, The College of Liberal Arts, The Daniel L. Goodwin College of Business and The College of Education and Health Services. Newer offerings are undergraduate programs in Entrepreneurship, Human Resource Management, Business Analytics, Exercise and Sports Studies, Music Education and Theology. Adult programs are offered through the School of Graduate, Adult and Professional Education. Master's degrees are offered in Accountancy, Business Administration, Business Analytics, Clinical Exercise Physiology, Clinical Psychology, Finance, Integrative Physiology, Linguistics, Management Information Systems, Management and Organizational Behavior, Nursing, Nutrition and Dietetics, Nutrition and Wellness, Public Health, Reading and Literacy, Taxation and Values-Driven Leadership.\n\nThe university offers 19 graduate programs, 34 graduate certificates, and 4 doctoral programs.

After the dedication of Benedictine Hall, new buildings were added throughout the early 1900s. Although it had admitted women from time to time, the college became fully coeducational in 1968. In 1971, it changed its name to Illinois Benedictine College. In response to community needs, graduate, doctorate and adult learner programs were added. In 1996, the college was renamed Benedictine University. The Birck Hall of Science and the Kindlon Hall of Learning were built in 2001. The Village of Lisle-Benedictine University Sports Complex, a unique cooperative venture between a governmental body and private university, was dedicated in 2005. Renovation of the Dan and Ada Rice Center was completed in October 2011.\n\nThe rapid growth of the Daniel L. Goodwin College of Business created the need for construction of the Daniel L. Goodwin Hall of Business – the largest classroom building on campus at 125,000 square feet – which houses the college's undergraduate and graduate business programs and doctoral programs in Organization Development and Values-Driven Leadership. The building also features classrooms, study areas, seminar rooms, offices, a 600-seat auditorium to facilitate lectures, a 40-seat real-time trading lab that provides hands-on investing experience, a 7,500-square-foot main hall and a café.\n\nThe Lisle campus' additionally features the Jurica-Suchy Nature Museum, a small natural history museum located on the second floor of the Birck Hall of Science. The museum represents the work of Frs. Edmund and Hilary Jurica, O.S.B., who collected specimens for their students to use during their almost 100 combined years of teaching at Benedictine University, and Fr. Theodore Suchy, O.S.B. (d. 2012), who served as museum curator for more than 30 years. The museum has continued to collect specimens since the Juricas' deaths in the early 1970s and now has a collection numbering more than 10,000 specimens ranging from small invertebrates to a roqual skeleton. The Jurica-Suchy Nature Museum is open to the public as well as to school groups.\n\nBenedictine's Lisle campus has 2,885 undergraduate students of which 44 percent are male and 56 percent are female, and the student body represents 50 states and territories, and 15 countries. Approximately one-third of the students are minority.\n\nThe Eagles, at the Lisle campus, compete in 19 intercollegiate athletic programs in the Northern Athletics Collegiate Conference (NACC) at the NCAA Division III level.\n\nThe Redhawks, at Benedictine University at Mesa, compete as members of the California Pacific Conference (CAL PAC) in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). The men's and women's golf, cross country, volleyball and tennis teams played their first season at the club level in 2014-15.\n\nBoth campuses also offer intramurals, group fitness classes and club sports. Benedictine students play men's tennis, men's lacrosse, and ping pong as club sports.\n\nBenedictine University Mesa, located in Mesa, Arizona, became the first four-year Catholic university in Arizona when classes began in 2013. Undergraduate majors include accounting, communication arts, computer science, criminal justice, fine arts, graphic arts and design, management and organizational behavior, nutrition, political science, psychology, theology and Spanish. As of 2019, the Mesa campus had 568 students, and 76 faculty and staff.\n\nThe university also provides degree-completion programs and graduate studies through its School for Graduate, Adult, and Professional Education.\n\nIts athletic teams are known as the Redhawks and compete in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics as a member of the California Pacific Conference. Student athletes compete in men's and women's cross country, golf, basketball, soccer, baseball and softball, and volleyball, including women's beach volleyball.\n\nIn 2019, Mesa established a partnership with Co+Hoots, a private co-working business based in Phoenix, Arizona, to explore innovative educational opportunities, which includes establishment of a \"certificate program in entrepreneurship\". The partnership, which fits into the city's plan to create a \"downtown innovation district\", included renovation and expansion of Mesa's downtown campus facility at 225 E. Main Street to include space which would be provided \"rent-free\" to Co+Hoots as a commercial co-working space. Benedictine leases this downtown facility from the city, a lease which ends in 2038, with an option to purchase beginning in 2033.\n\nThe Springfield branch campus of Benedictine University was founded in 1929 as a separate institution known as Springfield Junior College. The college changed its name in 1967 to Springfield College in Illinois. In early 2003, Springfield College in Illinois and Benedictine University formed a partnership through which Benedictine offered bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in Springfield. This partnership resulted in a merger between the two institutions, following Illinois Board of Higher Education guidelines and those of the U.S. Department of Education. In 2010, Benedictine University established a branch campus known as Benedictine University at Springfield. Springfield College in Illinois ceased all academic programs in August 2011. In fall 2014, the Benedictine University Board of Trustees decided that the Springfield campus would end programs that cater to undergraduate students and transition to an adult-centric academic community. Adult programs are now offered through the University's School of Graduate, Adult and Professional Education.\n\nOn February 27, 2018, The Benedictine University Board of Trustees and the Board of Springfield College in Illinois announced that the Springfield property at 1500 N. 5th St. will be offered for sale. At the conclusion of the 2018 spring semester, courses will no longer be taught at the Springfield branch campus. Starting with summer 2018 courses, the adult degree-completion and graduate students formerly at the Springfield branch campus will attend Benedictine University at employer and community sites in the Springfield area. The Springfield branch campus property is in need of capital improvements. The decision to move to other area sites will provide the university's students and faculty with accessible, comfortable and equipped-for-teaching locations.\n\nMore than 1,000 students have graduated with a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) or Master of Science in Management Information Systems (M.S.M.I.S.) from Benedictine University through its partnerships with two Chinese universities – Shenyang University of Technology (SUT) and Shenyang Jianzu University (SJZU) – formed in the early 2000s. In 2009, Benedictine partnered with two universities in Vietnam—the Vietnam National University (VNU) in Hanoi and Binh Dong University in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon)—to offer graduate programs in business administration and management information systems. In 2012, Benedictine received approval from the Ministry of Education in China to offer a Master of Public Health (M.P.H.) through a partnership with Dalian Medical University.\n\nThe Center for Values-Driven Leadership is a scholar-practitioner center located in the College of Business at Benedictine University. Founded in 2008, the Center (also known as the CVDL), was established to help leaders improve their companies and make significant contributions to business and society through their lives and work. James D. Ludema, Ph.D., professor of Organization Development; and Sandra Gill, Ph.D., dean of the College of Business, are co-founders. The Center's doctoral program in values-driven leadership offers a Ph.D. or D.B.A. (Doctor of Business Administration) degree in a format designed for senior executives. Notable students include Kathy Hopinkah Hannan, National Managing Partner with KPMG and the National Chair of the Board for Girl Scouts of the USA. The Center has partnered with the Center for Positive Organizations at the University of Michigan and with the Small Giants Community to create the Return on Values research initiative. This initiative explores the link between culture and profit in small and mid-size businesses.\n\n"}

Vajracharya means \"vajra carrier\". They are also commonly called guru-ju or gu-bhaju (a short form for \"guru bhaju\") which are Nepali terms related to the Sanskrit term guru, and translate as \"teacher\" or \"priest\". The bajracharya is the highest ranking of the Newar castes that are born Buddhist.\n\nThe emergence of vajracharya institution is ascribed to the decline of celibate Buddhist monks in about 13th century, and the emergence of Vajrayana.\n\nTo become a professional Guruju, a person of the bajracharya caste must go through a number of rituals. The bajracharya boy goes through a ritualistic process of initiation known as \"bajravishekha\", including shaving off the head as the buddha and asking for alms, at a minimum of seven houses a day in different places, in the tradition of monks since the time of Gautama Buddha. Sometimes tantric Newar Buddhism and Esoteric Buddhism is referred to as \"Vajracharya Buddhism\".\n\nThe writers of \"Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-century Nepal\" explore the unusual relationship of the vajracharyas and their assistant shakyas with Buddhist monasticism:\nUnlike Vajracharyas, Shakya men may not be priests for others, but together with Vajracharya men they are the members of the traditional Newar Buddhist monasteries, known honorifically as vihara and colloquially as Baha or Bahi. In so far as Shakya and Vajracharya men filled their roles in the monastery, they were monks. In effect, they were married, part-time monks.\nMany of the modern Buddhist scholars in Nepal belong to the vajracharya tradition.\nThere are several legendary vajracharya priests from different parts of Kathmandu valley. Shatikaracharya, a king who turned into a powerful tantric priest and disappeared inside the cave in Shantipur Swoyambhu is well known for his expertise in vajrayana buddhist practice. He is still believed to be dwelling inside the Shantipura cave performing intense sadhana.\nVajracharya Bandhudutta, who was a disciple of the legendary Shatikaracharya, is credited with bringing lord lokesvara form kamaru kamakhya Askam, in Kathmandu valley. Leela Vajra, a Buddhist priest from sakhu is believed to have built kasthamandap from the wood obtained from kalpabrikshhya ( wish fulfilling tree)\nSimilarly Surata Vajra, Vak Vajra, Sashwot Vajra, Manjuvajra ( Jamana Gubhaju) etc. are some of the famous Vajracharya priests whose folklores of magical and mystical deeds are popular among the people of Kathmandu valley\n\n\n"}

Before his NFL career, Breech played for the University of California, Berkeley and Sacramento High School. Breech was notable among kickers for wearing a different size cleat on his kicking foot. He wore a smaller size 5 cleat on his right kicking foot (his normal size was 7) which he felt gave him more control and stability kicking the football.\n\nBreech was the starting kicker for Cal in 1977 and 1978, making 58/59 extra points and 32/51 field goals (62%) in his two seasons. Breech was selected in the 8th round of the 1978 NFL Draft by the Detroit Lions but was cut by the team before the start of the season. He spent the 1979 season with the Raiders, but they cut him in the 1980 pre-season in order to sign kicker Chris Bahr, who had just been cut by the Bengals. Breech was later asked by Cleveland Browns personnel director Paul Warfield to possibly join the team as a replacement for injured Don Cockroft. However, not hearing back from Cleveland, he received a phone call from Bengal's assistant personnel director Frank Smouse. Breech was signed by the Bengals, and ended up staying there for the remainder of his career.\n\nIn his 14 NFL seasons, Breech made 243 of 340 field goals (71.4%), 517 of 539 extra points (95.9%), and scored 1,246 total points. His 1,151 points with the Bengals are a franchise record. He is second all-time scoring in consecutive games with 186 consecutive games, and he was a perfect 9 for 9 in overtime field goals, an NFL record. Breech played in 9 postseason games during his career. In all of them combined, he missed just 2 field goals out of 11 attempts and never missed an extra point. Breech also played in Super Bowl XVI and Super Bowl XXIII, was perfect in both games, not missing a field goal or extra point in either one. In Super Bowl XXIII, he kicked 3 field goals and scored 10 of Cincinnati's 16 points in the game. When his third field goal gave the Bengals a 16-13 lead over the San Francisco 49ers with just 3:10 left in the game, it appeared there was a strong possibility he would become the first kicker ever to win the Super Bowl MVP award. However, the 49ers ended that chance by driving 92 yards and scoring the winning touchdown with 34 seconds left in the game.\nIn 1999, he was inducted into the University of California Athletic hall of fame.\n\nBreech is currently a sales executive for the Hauser Group, an insurance firm in the Cincinnati suburb of Blue Ash, Ohio. He is the President of the Cincinnati chapter of the NFL Alumni and he is also on the board of directors for Kicks for Kids, an organization to help needy kids started by fellow former Cincinnati Bengals kicker, Doug Pelfrey.\n"}
{"id": "2006667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006667", "title": "Leslie Halliwell", "text": "Leslie Halliwell\n\nRobert James Leslie Halliwell (23 February 1929 – 21 January 1989) was a British film critic, encyclopaedist and television impresario who in 1965 compiled \"The Filmgoer's Companion\", the first one-volume encyclopaedia devoted to all aspects of the cinema. He followed it a dozen years later with \"Halliwell's Film Guide\", another monumental work of effort and devotion. In the era before the internet, Halliwell's books were regarded as the number one source for movie information, and his name became synonymous with film knowledge and research. Anthony Quinton wrote in the \"Times Literary Supplement\" in 1977:\n\nImmersed in the enjoyment of these fine books, one should look up for a moment to admire the quite astonishing combination of industry and authority in one man which has brought them into existence.\n\nIn his capacity as chief buyer for the ITV network, Halliwell was further responsible for bringing to British television screens some of the most popular films and shows of the 1970s and '80s, including \"The Six Million Dollar Man\", \"Charlie's Angels\", \"The Incredible Hulk\", \"The A-Team\", \"The Winds of War\", \"Jaws\", \"Star Wars\" and the James Bond movies.\n\nHalliwell's promotion of the cinema through his books and seasons of 'golden oldies' on Channel 4 won him awards from the London Film Critics' Circle, the British Film Institute and a posthumous BAFTA.\n\nBorn in Bolton, Lancashire in 1929, Halliwell was captivated by films from an early age. He grew up during the Golden Age of Hollywood, the period when the big studios churned out movies and wide-eyed cinemagoers packed the dream palaces. Halliwell and his mother Lily went almost nightly to the cinema, which offered them an escape from the grim reality of life in a soot-covered mill town.\n\nIn 1939, Halliwell won a scholarship to Bolton School and after national service he studied English Literature at St Catharine's College, Cambridge. As a young man he was a cheerful, often ebullient individual who ran film societies, performed in amateur theatre productions and inspired those around him with his seemingly boundless enthusiasm for the cinema.\n\nAfter graduating with a 2:1 honours degree, Halliwell worked briefly for \"Picturegoer\" magazine in London before returning to Cambridge to manage the Rex Cinema from 1952 to 1956. Under his management it became extremely popular with the Cambridge undergraduate community, showing classic and vintage films such as \"The Blue Angel\", \"Citizen Kane\" and \"Destry Rides Again\". The \"Cambridge Evening News\" reported, 'students felt their periods at Cambridge were incomplete without the weekly visit to the Rex.'\n\nIn 1955, after the British Censor had banned the Marlon Brando film \"The Wild One\", Halliwell arranged for Cambridge magistrates to assess the picture. They subsequently granted him a special licence and the Rex became the only cinema in Britain to show the film.\n\nHalliwell joined the Rank Organisation in 1956 on a three-year trainee course, after which he became a film publicist for the company. In 1958, he joined Southern Television and was seconded to Granada Television a year later, where he remained for the next thirty years, at their offices in London's Golden Square. He married Ruth Porter in 1959 and they had one son.\n\nInitially appointed Cecil Bernstein's assistant, Halliwell's reputation for vast cinema knowledge led to him gaining the role of Film Adviser to Granada's show \"Cinema\", which was the most popular arts programme on television during the 1960s. He was given responsibility for buying TV shows and in 1968 became the chief film buyer for the ITV network, a role he maintained throughout the 1970s and most of the 1980s.\n\nTravelling to Hollywood twice a year to view the latest TV pilots and film offerings and to trade fairs in Cannes and Monte Carlo, Halliwell became a major player in the television industry.\n\nIn 1982, at the invitation of Jeremy Isaacs, he became buyer and scheduler of US films for Channel 4. In keeping with the channel's intention to appeal to specialist audiences, Halliwell focused primarily on the 1930s and '40s. Over the next few years the channel showed hundreds of vintage movies in seasons, with many titles introduced by film-makers such as Samuel Goldwyn Jnr, Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat. Cinema fans and critics alike greatly appreciated Halliwell's efforts, with Jeremy Isaacs saying he had made an 'unsurpassed contribution' to the channel's success. The British Film Institute gave Halliwell an award in 1985 'for the selection and acquisition of films with a view to creative scheduling.' Author and film historian Jeffrey Richards wrote:\n\nFor lovers of the golden age of the cinema like myself, Channel 4 became a source of unalloyed delight as time and again one encountered films one had only ever read about and never expected to see.\n\nIn addition, Halliwell presented two television series celebrating the British wartime documentary movement: \"Home Front\", for Granada in 1982 and \"The British at War\" for Channel 4 two years later. Both featured classic Ministry of Information productions such as \"Listen to Britain\", \"Desert Victory\" and \"The True Glory\".\n\nPublished in 1965, Halliwell's pioneering work sold ten thousand copies on its first run, including four thousand in the United States. Over the next ten years the book gained a reputation as the number one source for film information. Many critics raved about his work but others were less enthusiastic, detecting small slivers of subjectivity among the facts, as well as a bias towards older films. Halliwell edited nine editions of the \"Companion\".\n\nGene Siskel wrote in 1975:\n\nThere is a well-developed consensus among film scribes that Leslie Halliwell's \"The Filmgoer's Companion\" is the single most valuable reference book on film.\"\n\nCharles Champlin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote in 1979, \"The referrer needs an iron will to look up only one fact.\" and TV presenter Denis Norden said \"\"The Filmgoer's Companion\" is to films what \"Wisden\" is to cricket.\"\n\nFirst published in 1977, this book incorporated capsule information on some 8,000 English-speaking titles. By the time of Halliwell's death in 1989, the \"Film Guide\" had doubled in size. He acknowledged his predecessors in the introduction to the first edition,\n\nI salute especially the work of Leonard Maltin, James Robert Parish, Denis Gifford, Douglas Eames and the unsung anonymous heroes who compiled the reviews of the BFI's \"Monthly Film Bulletin\" during the fifties and sixties.\n\nIn addition to receiving much praise for his work, Halliwell came under fire from journalists and critics for his laconic comments and dismissive stance on more recent films. His devotion to the Golden Age of Hollywood left him increasingly out of touch with modern attitudes. Long-time \"Observer\" film critic Philip French wrote that Halliwell 'isn't a scholar, critic or cineaste, but rather a movie buff, a man who knows the credits of everything but the value of very little.' Jim Emerson of the \"Orange County Register\" called Halliwell \"something of a grumpy old English fuddy-duddy [who] rarely has anything good to say about any movie made after 1960\".\n\nHalliwell's third encyclopaedic work began life as the \"Teleguide\" in 1979. Disappointed with the first edition, Halliwell joined with \"Sunday Telegraph\" critic Philip Purser to produce \"Halliwell's Television Companion\", which ran for a further two editions in 1982 and 1985. The third edition, published by Grafton in 1986, included over 12,000 entries.\n\nHalliwell retired from the television industry in 1986 but continued to edit his film guides. He wrote a regular TV article for the \"Daily Mail\" in 1987 and published a number of historical and critical works about the cinema; he also published three volumes of ghost stories inspired by M. R. James.\n\nHalliwell died of esophageal cancer at the Princess Alice Hospice in Esher, Surrey, a month before his 60th birthday.\n\nThis list of Leslie Halliwell's favourite films was originally published in the fifth edition of the \"Film Guide\".\n\nA biography, \"Halliwell's Horizon\", written by Michael Binder, was published in 2011.\n\n\n"}

Guldahl (November 22, 1911 – June 11, 1987) was an American professional golfer, one of the top five players in the sport from 1936 to 1940. He won sixteen PGA Tour-sanctioned tournaments, including three majors (two U.S. Opens and one Masters).\n\nBorn in Dallas, Texas, Guhldahl was a 1930 graduate of Woodrow Wilson High School. \n\nGuldahl started playing on the professional tournament circuit in 1931, and won an event in his rookie season before turning 20 years of age, setting a record that would not be matched until 2013, when Jordan Spieth won the John Deere Classic. In 1933, at the age of 21, Guldahl went into the last hole of the U.S. Open tied for the lead with Johnny Goodman. A par would have taken him into a playoff, but he made bogey and finished second. After further frustrating failures, Guldahl quit the sport temporarily in 1935 and became a car salesman. \n\nGuldahl made a comeback part way through the next PGA Tour season in 1936, won the prestigious Western Open and finished second on the money list. He won the Western Open in 1937 and 1938 as well. That tournament was recognized as one of the world's most important events at the time, on the level of a major championship or close to it.\n\nGuldahl's manner of play was relaxed: \"He paused to comb his hair before every hole, and would forestall any suspense by announcing exactly where he intended to plant the ball.\"\n\nGuldahl won three major championships. He claimed the U.S. Open title in 1937, with a then-record score of 281. He successfully defended the national title with his win in 1938, and was the last to win the U.S. Open while wearing a necktie during play in 1938. Guldahl was runner-up at the Masters in both 1937 and 1938, before taking that title in 1939. He played on his only Ryder Cup team in 1937, the last before a decade hiatus due to World War II.\n\nGuldahl reached the top in golf ahead of more famous players of his generation, including Sam Snead and fellow Texans Byron Nelson, Ben Hogan, and Jimmy Demaret, who all went on to build much longer and more productive pro careers. Guldahl's 16 PGA Tour wins all came in a ten-year span between 1931 and 1940. Guldahl put together five straight seasons -- from 1936 to 1940 -- with multiple PGA Tour titles.\n\nGuldahl was offered a book contract for a guide to golf, taking two months to complete \"Groove Your Golf\", a book that used high-speed photographs of Guldahl on each page to create \"flip-book\" movies. After completing the book in 1939, he returned to the PGA Tour. His last two wins came in 1940. Two-time PGA champion Paul Runyan commented, \"It's the most ridiculous thing, really. Guldahl went from being temporarily the best player in the world to one who couldn't play at all.\" His son, Ralph, claimed that his father over-analyzed his swing and it fell apart. According to his wife, Laverne: \"When he sat down to write that book, that's when he lost his game.\"\n\nIn an interview with the \"New York Times\" in 1979, Guldahl himself offered a different explanation for the slump in his game. When asked about destroying his talent by practicing in front of a mirror while writing the book, he responded: \"Nonsense. No such thing ever happened.\" During the interview, he offered several reasons for retiring: he was tired of life on the road; he wanted more time with his family; and the wartime slowdown in tournaments caused his game to grow rusty and he had little inclination to train. \"I never did have a tremendous desire to win.\"\n\nPaul Collins summed up Guldahl's decision to retire with these words: \"Guldahl's fate had little to do with overthinking his game, and much to do with the untutored Dallas boy who once loved to play abandoned courses and baseball diamonds alone. Far more than fame, what Ralph Guldahl wanted was a nice, quiet game of golf.\" Guldahl played occasionally in the 1940s but then quit tournament golf for good, except for several seasons in the 1960s, when he played in the Masters, as an eligible past champion, without notable success.\n\nHe spent the rest of his working life as a club professional. In 1961, he became the club pro at the new Braemar Country Club in Tarzana, California, where he was an instructor until his death. Among his students was billionaire Howard Hughes.\n\nGuldahl was inducted into the Texas Golf Hall of Fame in 1980. Guldahl was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1981. He died in Sherman Oaks, California, in 1987 at age 75.\n\nIn 1989, Guldahl was inducted into the Woodrow Wilson High School Hall of Fame when it was created during the celebration of the school's 60th Anniversary.

It serves as the administrative center of Aral District. Aral was formerly a fishing port and harbour city on the banks of the Aral Sea, and was a major supplier of fish to the neighboring region. Population: \n\nIn 1817, there was a village Alty-Kuduk (Six Wells) near the present city of Aralsk. This is currently a railway passing-track in the southern part of the city. Since the 1870s, this was recorded as the Aralsky settlement. The development of Aralsk began when the Orenburg-Tashkent railway was being constructed (1899-1905). In 1905, the railway station was constructed and continues to operate. The official history of Aralsk began that same year.\n\nIn 1905, Russian merchants organized large fishing companies and formed a joint-stock firm in Aralsk. This was the beginning of fishery in the Aral Sea and shipbuilding plants soon followed in Aralsk.\n\nAfter the Revolution, the station “Aralskoye more (sea)” with the adjoining settlement received the name Aralsk. In 1938, Aralsk and the Aralsky district became a part of newly formed Kzyl-Orda oblast of Kazakh SSR and turned into the town.\n\nAralsk is not to be confused with Fort Aralsk which was about 120 km south. In 1847 Russia built Raimsk, later called Fort Aralsk, near the mouth of the Syr Darya. In either 1848 or 1853 or 1855 Raimsk was abandoned and Fort Aralsk moved upriver to Fort Number One, or Kazalinsk. Further upriver were forts No. 2 and 3 which were the old Kokandi forts of Karmaktschy and Kumish-Kurgan. Fort Aralsk was used to launch ships to map the Aral Sea and as a base to attack Ak Mechet.\n\nSince the retreat of the Aral Sea since 1960, due to diversion of the rivers flowing into it for irrigation, mainly of cotton, during the Soviet era, Aral is now completely landlocked about 12 km from the northern remnant of the Aral Sea, though this is less than the 100 km distance observed before the completion of a dam in 2005. Aral has greatly diminished in population and socioeconomic significance, resulting in high levels of unemployment. For the last 25 years it has not been possible to see the sea from the town. There are also serious health problems for the local population caused by airborne toxic chemicals exposed to the wind by the retreating waters and, possibly, from chemical and biological agents unsafely stored on the island of Vozrozhdeniya.\n\nIn 1971, a massive public health response to a smallpox outbreak in Aral ensued once the disease was recognized as resulting from the release of weaponized smallpox from a nearby biological weapons test site. In less than 2 weeks, approximately 50,000 residents of Aral were vaccinated.

{"id": "2006706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006706", "title": "Two-hit hypothesis", "text": "Two-hit hypothesis\n\nThe Knudson hypothesis, also known as the two-hit hypothesis, is the hypothesis that most tumor suppressor genes require both alleles to be inactivated, either through mutations or through epigenetic silencing, to cause a phenotypic change. It was first formulated by Alfred G. Knudson in 1971 and led indirectly to the identification of cancer-related genes. Knudson won the 1998 Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award for this work.\n\nKnudson performed a statistical analysis on cases of retinoblastoma, a tumor of the retina that occurs both as an inherited disease and sporadically. He noted that inherited retinoblastoma occurs at a younger age than the sporadic disease. In addition, the children with inherited retinoblastoma often developed the tumor in both eyes, suggesting an underlying predisposition.\n\nKnudson suggested that two \"hits\" to DNA were necessary to cause the cancer. In the children with inherited retinoblastoma, the first mutation in what later came to be identified as the RB1 gene, was inherited, the second one acquired. In non-inherited retinoblastoma, instead two mutations, or \"hits\", had to take place before a tumor could develop, explaining the later onset.\n\nIt was later found that carcinogenesis (the development of cancer) depended both on the mutation of proto-oncogenes (genes that stimulate cell proliferation) and on the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, which are genes that keep proliferation in check. Knudson's hypothesis refers specifically, however, to the heterozygosity of tumor suppressor genes. An inactivation of both alleles is required, as a single functional tumor suppressor gene is usually sufficient. Some tumor suppressor genes have been found to be \"dose-dependent\" so that inhibition of one copy of the gene (either via genetic or epigenetic modification) may encourage a malignant phenotype, which is termed haploinsufficiency.\n\nField cancerization may be an extended form of the Knudson hypothesis. This is the phenomenon of various primary tumors developing in one particular area of the body, suggesting that an earlier \"hit\" predisposed the whole area for cancer.\n\nAnnounced in 2011, chromothripsis similarly involves multiple mutations, but asserts that they may all appear at once. This idea, affecting only 2–3% of cases of cancer, although up to 25% of bone cancers, involves the catastrophic shattering of a chromosome into tens or hundreds of pieces and then being patched back together incorrectly. This shattering, it is presumed, takes place when the chromosomes are compacted during normal cell division, but the trigger for the shattering is unknown. Under this model, cancer arises as the result of a single, isolated event, rather than the slow accumulation of multiple mutations.\n\nThe exact function of some tumor suppressor genes is not currently known (e.g. MEN1, WT1), but based on these genes following the Knudson \"two-hit\" hypothesis, they are strongly presumed to be suppressor genes.\n"}

When the man left for town, the \"tanuki\" cried and begged the man's wife who was making some \"mochi\", a sweet rice dish, to set him free, promising he would help her. The wife freed the animal, only to have it turn on her and kill her. The \"tanuki\" then planned a foul trick.\n\nUsing its shapeshifting abilities, the \"tanuki\" disguised itself as the wife and cooked a soup, using the dead woman's flesh. When the man came home, the \"tanuki\" served him the soup. After the meal, the \"tanuki\" reverted to its original appearance and revealed its treachery before running off and leaving the poor man in shock and grief.\n\nThe couple had been good friends with a rabbit that lived nearby. The rabbit approached the man and told him that it would avenge his wife's death. Pretending to befriend the \"tanuki\", the rabbit instead tortured it through various means, from dropping a bee's nest on it to 'treating' the stings with a peppery poultice that burned.\n\nThe title of the story comes from the especially painful trick that the rabbit played. While the \"tanuki\" was carrying a heavy load of kindling on his back to make a campfire for the night, he was so burdened that he did not immediately notice when the rabbit set fire to the kindling. Soon, the crackling sound reached its ears and it asked the rabbit what the sound was. \"It is \"Kachi-Kachi Yama\"\" the rabbit replied. \"We are not far from it, so it is no surprise that you can hear it!\". Eventually, the fire reached the tanuki's back, burning it badly, but without killing it.\n\nThe \"tanuki\" challenged the rabbit to a life or death contest to prove who was the better creature. They were each to build a boat and race across a lake in them. The rabbit carved its boat out of a fallen tree trunk, but the foolish \"tanuki\" made a boat of mud. In other versions the rabbit built both boats. \n\nThe two competitors were evenly matched at first, but the tanuki's mud boat began dissolving in the middle of the lake. As the \"tanuki\" was failing in its struggle to stay afloat, the rabbit proclaimed its friendship with the human couple, and that this was the tanuki's punishment for its horrible deeds. In other versions the rabbit strikes the \"tanuki\" with his oar to ensure he sinks. \n\nThe rabbit then goes back to the old man's home and tell him about the vengeance, much to the relief of the old man. He thanks the rabbit for his deed. \n\nThere are other versions that alter some details of the story, such as the severity of what the tanuki did to the woman and how the \"tanuki\" got the mud boat.\n\nMt. Kachi Kachi and its Tenjō-Yama Park Mt. Kachi Kachi Ropeway refer to this story and have statues depicting portions of the story.\n\nShikoku Tanuki Train Line railway station in Japan uses the slogan \"Our trains aren't made of mud\", a direct reference to the \"Kachi-Kachi Yama\" tale.\n\nIn the video game \"Super Mario Sunshine\", in the level \"Noki Bay\", Mario meets a \"Tanooki\" who gives free rides on mud boats, a clear reference to the boat that the \"tanuki\" in this tale used. While these boats can stay afloat, they will dissolve if they stay still for too long or if they bump into something.\n\nIn the \"anime\" \"Hoozuki no Reitetsu\", the rabbit is one of the best torturers in Hell, who goes into a blind rage when someone says the word \"tanuki\"/racoon.\n\nIn the comedic \"anime\" \"Heya Camp\", the main characters visit Mt. Kachi Kachi and relate the tale while riding the ropeway. They incorrectly recall the details however, mixing in portions of the fable The Tortoise and the Hare as well as leaving out the grim tone of the original, including stating “they all lived happily ever after”. All this serves to confuse the others sightseers in the cable car with them.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2006740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006740", "title": "Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan", "text": "Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan\n\nThe Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan (), commonly shortened to Komalah (; ), is an armed communist ethnic party of Kurds in Iran, currently exiled in northern Iraq. \n\nThe group is currently proscribed as a terrorist organization by Japan, aside from Iran. Since 2018, it is a registered lobby in the United States.\n\nKomalah has been engaged in guerrilla warfare against the Iranian government, notably during the 1979 Kurdish rebellion and the Iran–Iraq War. It was also involved in armed conflict against the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (KDPI) during the 1980s and early 1990s. After a long time ceasefire, in 2017 the organization declared to have resumed armed conflict with Iran.\n\nThe organization has \"no strong influence among the Kurds in Iran\", according to Rodi Hevian.\nIt is not known when exactly the organization began its activity. According to the account of Abdullah Mohtadi, together with six other Kurdish students in Tehran, he co-founded the group on 27 October 1969 at a secret initiation meeting. This is disputed by Hussein Moradbegi and Iraj Farzad, two co-founders who state that the group was officially born on 26 January 1979. Abbas Vali argues the latter view is correct, as the 1969-established organization had no specific ethnic identity and had no position on Kurdistan, and Kurdish members of the former –Foad Mostafa Soltani, Mohammad Hossein Karimi, Abdollah Mohtadi, Tayeb Abbas Ruh Illahi, Mohsen Rahimi, Ibrahim Alizade, Sa’ed Vatandoust, Hussein Moradbagi, Omar Ilkhanizadeh and Iraj Farzad– created an offshoot.\n\nThe organization initially operated underground, and went into public after the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Shortly afterwards, they boycotted March 1979 referendum, as well as the next referendum of December 1979. Ladislav Bittman wrote in \"The KGB and Soviet Disinformation\" that Komala was part of KGB's network in Iran, and was founded under financial and ideological influence of Soviet Union. Edgar O'Ballance states that Komala received \"help\" from the Soviet KGB. \n\nIn 1981, Komala refused to join the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI). \n\nIn September 1983, the group underwent organizational changes and patterned itself as an orthodox communist party, eventually joining Communist Party of Iran, as its Kurdish wing. In 2000, the faction led by Abdullah Mohtadi split from the latter and styled itself as the \"original\" Komala.\n\nDuring George W. Bush administration, the group's leader met American officials in 2005 and 2006 amidst approval of Iran Freedom and Support Act budget. While it is unclear which groups have been funded through the program, Mohtadi welcomed an aid in 2008 and stated \"If you’re a political movement that is part of an opposition, you need help from abroad... We're not ashamed to admit it.\"\n\nOn grounds that politburo acts non-democratic, the faction led by Omar Ilkhanizade split in October 2007, founding the faction of reform. On 29 April 2008, another faction led by Abdulla Konaposhi accused Mohtadi of \"non-democratic management\", and expressing dissatifcation to a policy of a cooperation with monarchists including Reza Pahlavi, split from the group to establish the reunification faction.\n\nThe group is ideologically Marxist–Leninist, therefore it saw itself revolutionary and transcending ethnic boundaries, unlike rival Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan. It was predominantly Maoist during first decade of its activity and adopted it as a mobilization strategy to recruit from peasantry and lower urban class. Michael Gunter says that inspired by Chinese Communist Revolution, they became Maoists and viewed Kurdish nationalism as parochial.\n\nHowever at its first congress held in 1979, the ideology was renounced due to being \"inappropriate to Kurdish conditions in Iran\". In 1981, the group initiated self-criticism of its past and concluded that what it needs is \"strong links with the proletariat\".\n\nFollowing Iran–Iraq War, the group were stationed inside Iraqi soil and were supported by Saddam Hussein and his Ba'athist regime, who was willing to leverage insurgent groups against Tehran. Saddam gave the group money, logistical support and arms. After 1991, they found more secure sanctuaries under \"de facto\" autonomous Kurdistan Region.\n\nHeadquarters of the group is currently located in an installation in Zergwez, about a 20-minute drive southeast of Sulaymaniya. A European mission reported in 2012 that the camp has strict security measures at the entry gate. Their previous camp was located in the vicinity of Halabja, near Iran–Iraq border, but after they suffered from attacks by Iranian Armed Forces, they moved to the current place.\n\nJames Martin of \"The Jerusalem Post\" who visited the camp in 2007, wrote that Komala guerillas were equipped with AK-47s and RPGs, and are also trained in using anti-aircraft guns.\n\nA report published by Combating Terrorism Center in 2017, estimated that the group has less than 1,000 members.\n\nThe following countries have listed Komola as a terrorist organization:\nIn September 2018, the group opened an office in Washington D.C., and formally registered as a lobby organization in the United States, while it was reported to hold meetings with Congressmen from both parties since at least 2015. According to filed reports, Komala spent $7,500 in 2018 and in the next year, penned a $4,000 per month contract with the firm AF International, along with another worth $40,000 with Cogent Law Group. One-fourth of latter included working on an op-ed, advise to establish a charitable foundation in the U.S., and \"develop\" Wikipedia page.\n"}
{"id": "2006761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006761", "title": "Edwin Jarvis", "text": "Edwin Jarvis\n\nEdwin Jarvis is a supporting character in the Marvel Comics titles \"Iron Man\" and \"The Avengers\". He is the loyal household butler of the Stark family. Since the 1990s, the character has appeared heavily in media adaptations of \"Iron Man\" and \"Avengers\" stories.\n\nIn 2012, Edwin Jarvis was ranked 25th in IGN's list of \"The Top 50 Avengers\". In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Edwin Jarvis was portrayed by James D'Arcy in the ABC television series \"Agent Carter\" and the 2019 film \"\".\n\nJarvis first appeared in \"Tales of Suspense\" #59 (November 1964), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Jarvis received an entry in the \"Official Mightiest Heroes!\" from an \"Avengers\" backup story featuring Jarvis.\n\nBorn of modest origins, Edwin Jarvis served in the Royal Air Force during World War II and was its champion boxer three years running. He later moved to the United States where he became manservant to Howard Stark and Maria Stark and watched over the Starks' mansion even after the two deaths.\n\nHis name and English origin bears resemblance to Jeeves, the fictional sagacious valet in the books by P. G. Wodehouse.\nWhen Iron Man (Tony Stark) called the Avengers' first meeting and donated the Stark house as the Avengers Mansion headquarters, Jarvis grew accustomed to the guests and served the Avengers for many years thereafter, acting as a father figure to some of the newcomers. Jarvis was there when the first guest, the time-lost Captain America (Steve Rogers), became a member of the Avengers. He was the only one to stay with the Avengers for their entire existence, a distinction not even Captain America can claim. As a result, Captain America has stated that Jarvis should be just as much of an Avenger as he is.\n\nJarvis spent some time as the primary babysitter for Franklin Richards, the super-powered son of Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, when the two Fantastic Four members were residing at the mansion. He also served as the sponsor to Silverclaw while the latter was growing up, and the future Avengers member has come to regard him as an uncle.\n\nBeing a manservant to the Avengers meant that Jarvis has had to deal with their enemies on several occasions. In \"Avengers\" #59 and #60 (December 1969, January 1970), he was assaulted by intruders in the mansion and bound and gagged. Jarvis has also been personally involved in many adventures, including leading the evacuation of a stalled subway train during a citywide disaster and battling a demonically possessed car. Jarvis defended the floating Hydrobase against a horde of robots built by Doctor Doom during the Acts of Vengeance crisis. He was present when one of the many incarnations of the Masters of Evil attacked the mansion. Taken hostage, he was brutally beaten by Mr. Hyde while Captain America and the Black Knight were forced to watch. His physical injuries included a shattered knee and 90% loss of vision in his left eye, forcing him to wear an eyepatch for some time; however, Jarvis refused to retire, believing instead that confronting his fears gave him more in common with the Avengers. Jarvis personally confronted Loki, risking great danger, after realizing the villain had tricked his way inside the mansion. He tendered his resignation during Iron Man's battle with alcoholism, but returned not long afterwards.\n\nIn his duties as the Avengers' manservant, he was entrusted with items of great power, including the Casket of Ancient Winters.\n\nWhen the New Avengers were formed, Jarvis was called back after taking a holiday \"for the first time in years\", having been informed that his 'special' services were once again needed. Jarvis often confronts Wolverine over the man's poor kitchen etiquette, a battle only new member Spider-Man's Aunt May was able to win. Jarvis seemingly struck up a relationship with May that had moved into Stark Tower with Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson after her house burnt down. When Spider-Man switched sides during the Civil War, however, May and Mary Jane fled Stark Tower to live in hiding. In a \"New Avengers\" \"Civil War\" story, Jarvis was shot by an employee who was opposed to Tony Stark using technology invented to enforce the Superhuman Registration Act. However, it appears Jarvis recovers from this wound as he is shown to be working again in \"\". He also humorously mentions that if Stark allowed \"that Tigra %^#$\" in the new incarnation of the Avengers, Tony would need to find someone else to do the laundry; Tigra had worked for Stark's side throughout the entirety of the \"Civil War\" incident. In the 2008 storyline \"\", Jarvis is given over $2,000,000 by Stark to pay for May's hospital bills following an assassination attempt in the aftermath of Peter's own decision to publicly reveal Spider-Man's true identity. Jarvis visibly breaks down upon seeing May in the hospital bed, confessing his deep love to the Parkers. As a consequence of the \"One More Day\" storyline, however, Spider-Man's timeline has undergone a major continuity overhaul, including Jarvis's relationship with the Parkers.\n\nLater that year, the \"Secret Invasion\" storyline revealed that Edwin Jarvis has been replaced by a Skrull agent for some time. Using a computer virus, he disables a number of Stark Enterprises facilities, as well as Iron Man's armor. This agent also obtained access to Tony Stark's records on the Sentry (Robert Reynolds) in order to discover weaknesses, as the Skrulls were unable to duplicate Sentry's powers because Sentry's limits were unknown even to Iron Man. He later approaches Maria Hill on the destroyed S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier in the middle of the ocean and tells Maria to surrender along with the S.H.I.E.L.D. crew. Maria uses a Life Model Decoy as a distraction while the real one escapes and detonates the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. During the fight between Veranke and Criti Noll's forces against the heroes and villains, the Skrull-Jarvis (who somehow survived the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier explosion) watches from Avengers Tower as the energy washes over hero, villain and Skrull alike. While holding Jessica Jones and Luke Cage's child, he comments that it doesn't matter if the Skrulls win or lose, so long as \"God's\" will is done. After the final battle, the real Jarvis is discovered alive, prompting Jessica to discover that her baby had been taken by the Skrull impostor. During the \"Dark Reign\" storyline, Jarvis is later shown in a support group meeting with the others that had been replaced by Skrulls. The Skrull impersonator is eventually found in a hideout and was shot by Bullseye after returning Luke's and Jessica's baby. Having refused to serve under Norman Osborn's personal Avengers, Jarvis is sought out by Hercules and Amadeus Cho to be a part of the new Mighty Avengers team, Amadeus having determined that Jarvis is the one constant of the Avengers.\n\nDuring the \"Fear Itself\" storyline, Jarvis manages to escape Avengers Tower when it's under attack by the Thing (in the form of Angrir: Breaker of Souls). Red Hulk tries unsuccessfully to stop him but the Tower gets destroyed and he's knocked out of the city and into Vermont.\n\nDuring the \"AXIS\" storyline, when key members of the Avengers and the X-Men underwent a moral inversion, Jarvis and the Hulk tried to stop the Avengers when the group planned to kill the Red Skull, but were ignored and attacked, Jarvis being knocked aside while Hulk's anger triggered his own inverted transformation into 'Kluh'. However, Jarvis had anticipated a problem based on the Avengers' actions since the group's return from the island, and had already hidden Red Skull away until he could explain the situation to Steve Rogers and was then able to retrieve Red Skull and return the heroes and villains to normal.\n\nDuring the \"Secret Wars\" storyline, Demolition Man met with Jarvis and Rage at Avengers Mansion during the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.\n\nAs part of the \"All-New, All-Different Marvel\", Edwin Jarvis is welcomed to the new headquarters of the Avengers. When Jarvis wonders if his services are needed or not, Iron Man convinces him to help out the Avengers. Jarvis is present with the Avengers when they meet Nadia Pym, Hank Pym's daughter through Maria Trovaya who now sports a modified Wasp suit. After Nadia helps to stabilize the Vision, Jarvis takes Nadia on a road trip to meet the latter's extended family.\n\nWhen the Earth and Moon are dragged into the Contest of Champions schemes by the Challenger during No Surrender, Jarvis is one of the heroes on Earth involved in this scheme, almost sacrificing his life saving a child from a crumbling building as the Contest began. Jarvis barely survived and went into a coma, almost dying before he came under the care of Beast and Nadia to save him from a small parasitic alien inside his head. After Beast and Nadia saved his life, upon regaining consciousness, Jarvis revealed that he had no true memory of the existence of the \"heroine\" Voyager/Valerie Vector back in the 1900s, as she had been playing with the heroes' memories all along, creating the illusion that she was one of the original Avengers members, leaving her true origins unknown, until she is revealed to be the Grandmaster's biological daughter.\n\nAfter the contest is over, Nadia made Edwin Jarvis a new version of J.A.R.V.I.S. to be his helpmate. When Edwin thought it was a sign for him to retire, J.A.R.V.I.S. stated that its programming is not yet complete.\n\nEdwin Jarvis once started a pen pal relationship with a young girl who would grow up to be the superhero Silverclaw; it was later revealed that the orphanage, aware of Silverclaw's abilities and Jarvis's ties to the Avengers, chose to assign Jarvis as Silverclaw's sponsor in the hope that his ties to the Avengers could be useful. Silverclaw's trip to the United States to meet Jarvis would be foiled when the youth was forced into helping terrorists in a massive attack. Silverclaw's efforts helped the people in danger at the airport, including Jarvis himself. Since then, Silverclaw has referred to him as 'Tio (Uncle) Edwin', with Avengers such as Janet van Dyne noting that Silverclaw's ties to Jarvis made the girl practically family.\n\nWhile Jarvis was shown dating May Parker during Spider-Man's initial career in the New Avengers, this relationship has been negated by the revelation that the man that May had dated was a Skrull impostor.\n\nJarvis also has a mother to whom he is very close.\n\nEdwin Jarvis is skilled at self-defence and basic hand-to-hand combat. He was a former boxing champion of the Royal Air Force for three years and had received military combat training and personal tutelage in unarmed combat by Captain America. Although he is in good health and physical condition, past injuries inflicted by Mister Hyde may have hampered his fighting prowess.\n\nIn the \"House of M: Iron Man\" series, the A.I. system in Tony Stark's suit is referred to as \"Jarvis\", predating the AI version seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nIn the \"Marvel Zombies\" mini-series in which all of the world's superheroes (and many of the villains) are transformed by a sentient alien virus into flesh-eating zombies, it is revealed that Edwin Jarvis was torn apart and shared-out amongst the Avengers. As Colonel America speculated, he appears to have been so mortified by the spectacle of his beloved Avengers as hungry corpses that he barely put up a fight.\n\nIn the \"Marvel Noir\" universe, Edwin Jarvis is Tony Stark's engineer and personal assistant.\n\nEdwin Jarvis, now with visibly gray hair, continues to serve as the butler to the Avengers Next in the MC2 universe. During the initial 12 issue run of \"A-Next\", Jarvis is shown as a mentor to the young heroes. Along with Scott Lang, Jarvis attempts to aid and assist the Avengers anyway he can. He was later joined by Tony Stark and the blind Hawkeye.\n\nThe Ultimate Marvel version of Edwin Jarvis is different from his original version and is much more sarcastic and acerbic towards his employer Iron Man (Tony Stark). Jarvis is only Tony's personal butler. While Tony dated and became engaged to Natasha Romanova, Jarvis was shown to be continuously at odds with Natasha and both were quick to hurl insults at one another. Jarvis was later shot in the head by Natasha, a traitor within the Ultimates team. His death is a contributing factor to Tony's descent into full-blown alcoholism. \n\nAnother Ultimate equivalent is William \"Jarvis\", Tony's new personal servant tolerates being called Jarvis. \n\n\n\n"}

It was closely related to the Automatic Voice Network or AUTOVON, which was the main non-secure switched telephone network for the military.\n\nDuring the mid 1960s, the United States Government decided to implement a worldwide secure voice network. This was named Automatic Secure Voice Communications Network, or by its acronym AUTOSEVOCOM, and was the National Security Agency's first program for the United States Department of Defense's telephone protection. It was a cumbersome and expensive system that was available only for high-level users. Because of its inadequacies, the Defense Department capped it at 1850 terminals, and in the late 1960s, hoping for something better, decided not to continue with the expansion of AUTOSEVOCOM.\n\nPhase I of the network was approved by the Deputy Secretary of Defense in July 1967 and after that it took several years to implement AUTOSEVOCOM within the continental United States. AUTOSEVOCOM-I was a non-tactical network that enabled users to discuss classified or sensitive information over the telephone. The network consisted of switching centres, transmission facilities and subscriber terminals. Subscribers were homed either on an AUTOSEVOCOM switch, on an Automatic Voice Network (AUTOVON) switch, or a Joint Overseas Switchboard (JOSS), which were for example operated and maintained by numerous Signal Battalions in Vietnam.\n\nThe AUTOSEVOCOM switches provided for wideband secure voice communications between local subscribers and enabled them to establish long-distance secure voice calls. The majority of the long-distance calls were routed by the AUTOVON.\n\nDifficulties with speech intelligibility, requirements for voice recognition, the holding of telephone conferences, speedier service, and simpler calling procedures led Defense officials to approve the development of an improved system, called AUTOSEVOCOM II. The Army was designated as the agency with the primary responsibility of developing the system. In May 1976, the Deputy Secretary of Defense approved the full-scale development of the AUTOSEVOCOM II programme.\n\nAUTOSEVOCOM II incorporated technological advances and furnished higher quality communications for the several thousand subscribers who were expected to use it when put into operation during the years 1980 to 1985. The U.S. Army Communications Command acted as program manager for AUTOSEVOCOM II.\n\nThe Automatic Secure Voice Communications Network was succeeded by the Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN) and the STU-III secure phones. The last AUTOSEVOCOM secure voice switch in the world was deactivated at the Pentagon in 1994.\n\n"}

It almost always refers to either a flatlined electrocardiogram, where the heart shows no electrical activity (asystole), or to a flat electroencephalogram, in which the brain shows no electrical activity (brain death). Both of these specific cases are involved in various definitions of death.\n\nA cardiac flatline is also called asystole. It can possibly be generated by malfunction of the electrocardiography device, but it is recommended to first rule out a true asystole because of the emergency of such condition.\n\nWhen a patient displays a cardiac flatline, the treatment of choice is cardiopulmonary resuscitation and injection of vasopressin (epinephrine and atropine are also possibilities). Successful resuscitation is generally unlikely and is inversely related to the length of time spent attempting resuscitation. Defibrillation is not recommended, despite commonly appearing on medical dramas as a remedy for asystole, but can be used for certain other causes of cardiac arrest.\n"}

It was nicknamed the \"Baby Austin\" and was at that time one of the most popular cars produced for the British market and sold well abroad. Its effect on the British market was similar to that of the Model T Ford in the US, replacing most other British economy cars and cyclecars of the early 1920s. It was also licensed and copied by companies all over the world. The very first BMW car, the BMW Dixi, was a licensed Austin 7. In France they were made and sold as Rosengarts, and in the United States they were built by the American Austin Car Company. In Japan, Nissan also used the 7 design as the basis for their first cars, although not under licence. This eventually led to a 1952 agreement for Nissan to build and sell Austins in Japan under the Austin name.\n\nMany Austin 7s were rebuilt as \"specials\" after the Second World War, including the first race car built by Bruce McLaren, and the first Lotus, the Mark I. Companies such as Speedex in Luton thrived in the late 1950s by producing race-proven bodies and engine parts for the Seven chassis. \n\nSuch was the power of the Austin 7 name that the company re-used it for early versions of the A30 in 1951 and Mini in 1959.\n\nUntil the First World War Austin built mainly large cars, but in 1909 they sold a single-cylinder small car built by Swift of Coventry called the Austin 7 hp. After this they returned to bigger cars.\n\nIn 1920 Sir Herbert Austin commenced working on the concept of a smaller car, mainly to meet the needs of young families aspiring to own an affordable motor car. This idea was spurred on by the introduction of the Horsepower Tax in 1921. His design concept marked a departure from his company's conservative motoring past and Austin received considerable opposition from his board of directors and creditors. Because the company was in receivership Austin decided to carry out the project himself on his own account and in 1921 hired an 18-year-old draughtsman, Stanley Edge, from the Austin factory at Longbridge, Birmingham to aid in the drawing of detailed plans. This work was carried out in the billiard room of Austin's Lickey Grange home.\n\nEdge convinced Austin to use a small four-cylinder engine. The original side valve engine design featured a capacity of 696cc (55mm x 77mm) giving a RAC rating of 7.2 hp, the cast cylinder block featured a detachable head and was mounted on an aluminium crankcase. The crankshaft used one roller and two ball bearings and the big-ends were splash lubricated. Edge also carried out the design of other mechanical components such as the three speed gearbox and clutch assembly. Austin was largely responsible for styling the Seven's design, which was reportedly influenced by the design of the Peugeot Quadrilette. The \"A\" frame chassis design was believed to have been influenced by the design of an American truck used in the Longbridge factory in the early 1920s.\n\nThe design was completed in 1922 and three prototypes were constructed in a special area of the Longbridge factory, and announced to the public in July 1922. Austin had put a large amount of his own money into the design and patented many of its innovations in his own name. In return for his investment he was paid a royalty of two guineas (£2, 2s), (£2.10) on every car sold.\n\nNearly 2,500 cars were made in the first year of production (1923), not as many as hoped, but within a few years the \"big car in miniature\" had wiped out the cyclecar industry and transformed the fortunes of the Austin Motor Co. By 1939 when production finally ended, 290,000 cars and vans had been made.\n\nThe Austin 7 was considerably smaller than the Ford Model T. The wheelbase was only 6 ft 3 inches (1.905 m), and the track only 40 inches (1.016 m). Equally it was lighter – less than half the Ford's weight at 794 pounds (360 kg). The engine required for adequate performance was therefore equally reduced and the 747 cc sidevalve was quite capable with a modest actual 10 hp output.\n\nThe chassis took the form of an \"A\" with the engine mounted between the channel sections at the narrow front end. The rear suspension was by quarter elliptic springs cantilevered from the rear of the chassis while at the front the beam axle had a centrally mounted half elliptic transverse spring. Early cars did not have any shock absorbers. Brakes were on all wheels but at first the front brakes were operated by the handbrake and the rear by the footbrake, becoming fully coupled in 1930.\n\nIn late 1931 the chassis was lengthened by 6\" with a corresponding increase in the rear track. Steering is by worm and wheel mechanism.\n\nThe original 1922 four-cylinder Austin Seven engine had a bore of 2.125\" (54mm) and stroke of 3\" (76mm), giving a capacity of 696 cc and RAC rating of 7.2 hp. From March 1923 the bore was increased to 2.2\" (56mm) giving 747 cc and 10.5 hp. The side-valve engine was composed of an aluminium crankcase, cast iron cylinder block and cast iron cylinder head. Cooling was by thermosiphon, without a water pump, and the dynamo was driven from the timing gears.\n\nThe big end bearings were lubricated by jets from an oil gallery in the crankcase, the oil striking the crankshaft webs which were drilled accordingly. Originally the journal diameter was 1.125\"; this was later increased to 1.3125\". The three bearing engine (from 1936) used a white metal centre bearing.\n\nThe splash-lubricated crankshaft (pressure fed on some sports models) at first ran in two bearings (two ball bearings at the front, roller at the back) changing to three in 1936. An electric starter was fitted from November 1923. The early cars used magneto ignition, but this was changed to coil in 1928.\n\nThe 3-speed and reverse gearbox was bolted to the back of the engine and had a variety of ratios depending on the application: touring, sports, racing and trials. A four-speed gearbox was introduced in 1932 and in 1933 synchromesh was added to third and top ratios extending to second gear in 1934.\n\nThe back axle was of spiral bevel type with ratios between 4.4:1 and 5.6:1 with 4.9 ; 1 being the most common until the 1930s. A short torque tube ran forward from the differential housing to a bearing and bracket on the rear axle cross member.\n\nReliant used a derivative of the Austin Seven engine for their early three-wheelers, before developing an aluminium alloy engine (used as the replacement for the Austin Seven engine by the 750 Motor Club in their Formula 750 motor sport).\n\nHerbert Austin's son-in-law, Arthur Waite, soon began to achieve remarkable sporting successes beginning at Brooklands in March 1923 and the next month at Monza. Another driver, E C Gordon England, persuaded Sir Herbert to provide him with a racing 7. Waite and Lou Kings (chief tester) then experienced a run of failure brought about by inadequate engine lubrication for racing conditions. Meanwhile, Gordon England, flushed with success from establishing six new class records at Brooklands, had built a special lightweight 2-seater body weighing just and entered it in the 1100 cc class for the Junior Car Club 200 mile race at Brooklands in October 1923. There England finished in second place and during the race won another five class records.\n\nAs a result two new sports models were offered by Austin in January 1924, the Sports and the Brooklands Super-sports. The Brooklands Super-sports was a replica of England's record-breaker. Each car was sold with a Brooklands certificate proving a speed of per hour. By 1925 Gordon England held nineteen 750 cc class records.\n\nThe first Austin 7 saloon was made by England's coachbuilding company. England had been an aircraft designer with Bristol Gordon England biplanes. His fabric saloon body based on aircraft principles was said to be the smallest closed car in the world. Its body weighed less than the tourer and at £210, almost double the £112 chassis price. It showed there would be a market for an Austin-made steel-panelled saloon which was introduced in September 1926 at £165 (equivalent to £ today)\n\nUntil fabric bodies fell from fashion in the early 1930s the Gordon England Fabric \"de luxe\" Saloon remained in Austin's catalogue at a £20 (14%) premium over Austin's standard steel saloon. It was accompanied by their 2-seater Gordon England Cup Model.\n\nIn 1927, William Lyons, co-founder of the Swallow Sidecar Company, saw the commercial potential of producing a re-bodied Austin 7. Buying a chassis from dealer Parkers of Bolton Lyons commissioned Swallow's talented employee, coachbuilder Cyril Holland, to produce a distinctive open tourer: the Austin Seven Swallow. Holland (1895- ) who joined Swallow in late 1926 had served his apprenticeship with Lanchester and would become chief body engineer. The height of saloon car fashion of the day was to have the back of the body fully rounded, this was called \"dome\" shaped.\n\nWith its bright two-tone colour scheme and a style befitting more expensive cars of the time, together with its low cost (£175), the Swallow proved popular and was followed in 1928 by a saloon version: the Austin Seven Swallow Saloon.\n\nApproximately 3,500 bodies of various styles were produced up until 1932, when Lyons started making complete cars under the SS brand.\n\nSuch was the demand for the Austin Seven Swallows that Lyons was forced to move in 1928 from Blackpool to new premises in Coventry. It was, in part, the success of the Swallows that laid the foundations of what was to become, by 1945, Jaguar Cars.\n\nVersions of the Austin 7 were made under licence by American Austin from 1930, Dixi (later bought by BMW) in Germany from 1927 and Rosengart in France from 1928. Austin 7s were also manufactured by Nissan (Datsun) but reports differ as to whether these were built under licence or were unlicensed copies. In addition, rolling chassis were exported to Australia to have locally made bodies attached.\n\nThe American Austin Car Company was founded in 1929, in Butler, Pennsylvania, in premises that had belonged to the Standard Steel Car Company. Their intention was to assemble and sell in the United States a version of the Austin 7 car, called American Austin. After some initial success the Great Depression set in, and sales fell off to the point that production was suspended. In 1934 the company filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThe automobile was designed in the hopes of creating a market for small-car enthusiasts in the United States. The cars had inline-four engines, enabling the car to return , and travel per fill of oil.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War I the Australian Government imposed a tariff on imported vehicles, with tax concessions applying to rolling chassis, as a stimulus to develop a sovereign motor vehicle industry. The chassis concession acted as a financial incentive for local coach-builders to import factory built rolling chassis, and fit uniquely Australian designed and built bodies, leading to the establishment of an Australian motor vehicle bodybuilding industry in the early 1920s.\n\nThe largest and best known of these Australian coach-builders was Holden's Motor Body Builders. Holden built Australian-bodied Austin Seven tourer and roadster models from the mid 1920s.\n\nHowever, several smaller coach-builders built limited numbers of Australian-bodied Austin Seven sports models between 1924-34. Some examples of these Australian-bodied sports models are; the Standard Sports, built by Flood Motor Body Works, St Kilda Road, Melbourne; the Wasp built by William Green, Parramatta Road, Petersham, Sydney; the Moth built by Geo Sykes, Gordon Road, Chatswood, Sydney; the Comet built by Bill Conoulty, Sydney; and the Meteor. The Meteor was built by several coach-builders (Flood Motor Body Works, St Kilda Road, Melbourne; Jack Lonzar, Kent Town Adelaide; and A Robinson & Co., 181 Castlereagh St, Sydney), with individual variations to the common design.\n\nIn 2007, during an episode of \"Top Gear\", Jeremy Clarkson and James May studied a number of early car designs (including the Ford Model T and the De Dion-Bouton Model Q) and concluded that the Austin Seven was the first mass-market car to be fitted with a \"conventional\" control layout, as found on modern cars (although the earliest car they found to use this layout was a Cadillac Type 53 in 1916).\n\nThe Ulster gained its name from a strong performance in the 1929 RAC Tourist Trophy held at the Ards circuit in County Down, where Archie Frazer-Nash finished third and S. V. Holbrook finished fourth.\n\n In Australia Arthur Waite won the 1928 100 Miles Road Race driving an Austin 7.\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 18, 2003.\n\nThe town goes to the Springfield Botanical Gardens to see the blooming of a Sumatran Century Flower. Because the huge crowd is exactly one person over the maximum legal capacity, Chief Wiggum decides to eject the already unpopular and bitter Moe from the ceremony. However, this otherwise unwelcoming gesture is a blessing in disguise, as when the flower opens, it emits a horrible smell, sickening the townspeople and causing them to flee. When the townspeople start to drive away from the Botanical Gardens, the Simpsons become trapped in a traffic jam. Lisa tries to warn Homer that the traffic is moving, but he accelerates too hard and hits the brakes suddenly. The force sends Maggie flying through the sunroof after her safety belt breaks. Moe, who is incidentally standing depressed on the edge of a bridge about to jump and commit suicide, accidentally catches Maggie just as she is about to fall into the river below the bridge. Moe is then instantly declared a hero, much to his surprise, and he instantly falls in love with the infant.\n\nThe Simpsons let Moe babysit Maggie all the time and she is instantly attached to him. After a while, Marge is happy that she has had plenty of time to get things done, but Homer feels left out of Maggie's life and worries because she is his last chance to be a good father. Later, Moe tells Maggie the story of \"The Godfather\". When he gets to the part where Don Corleone plays with his grandson, Moe demonstrates how the Don scares him by sticking a cut-up orange in his mouth, and Maggie enjoys it. When it comes to Maggie's birthday party, Moe annoys everyone with his behavior and his gift to Maggie: a toy-sized rendition of his bar, featuring \"Classic Drunk Barney\" and \"Drunk Talking Homer\". When Marge and Homer learn that Moe has installed his own baby-monitoring system in Maggie's room, they decide that they have had enough, and as a result, they ban Moe from their house for good.\n\nMoe reverts to being depressed, to the point of him imagining the barflies as Maggie. One night, the family is asleep, and Maggie wakes up and hears the mafia outside the house, plotting to kill the Castellaneta family. When one of the mobsters feels hesitant, Fat Tony does the Godfather-orange routine to cheer him up, and Maggie recognizes it and decides to follow the mobsters. When Homer and Marge find her missing, they assume that Moe kidnapped her, and they track him down with the aid of the police. They see Moe at his oven, and they think that Maggie is inside, but it turns out to really be a ham. When Moe is told that Maggie is missing, he offers to help the Simpsons find her. Searching the Simpsons' house yard, the group find the cut-up orange that Fat Tony used, and Moe works out that Maggie must have followed the mobsters.\n\nMaggie follows the mobsters to Luigi's, where Fat Tony's gang and the Castellanetas are having a meeting. Maggie enters the restaurant where the two gangs are about to start a gun battle. The situation deteriorates when both groups of mobsters are aiming weapons at each other and Maggie is in the middle of an \"Italian-American Mexican standoff\". Homer, Marge and Moe are standing outside and Moe decides to go inside and save Maggie. Moe goes inside, and to prevent being shot, tells the gangsters about Maggie's innocence and how it redeemed his life. They start to cry, and Moe and Maggie leave safely. The family apologizes for their injustice against Moe, and Homer and Moe decide to have a \"playdate\": Homer spends quality time with the ham, and Moe spends more time with Maggie.\n\n\"Moe Baby Blues\" was written by J. Stewart Burns and directed by Lauren MacMullan as part of the fourteenth season of \"The Simpsons\" (2002–2003).\n\nThe episode has received positive reviews from critics. \"The A.V. Club\" writer Emily VanDerWerff, who holds the opinion that by the start of the 2000s \"The Simpsons\" had declined in quality compared to its earlier years, praised \"Moe Baby Blues\" for being as good as the better episodes of the series.\n\nIn 2009 she wrote, \"No matter how hard showrunner Al Jean tried to bring the show back to its roots after Mike Scully turned it into a cartoonish fantasy early in the decade, there was always something missing. The series, which had done everything, mostly lost its ability to surprise. Every so often, though, it came up with an episode like this one, offering a funny new way to use the characters.\" VanDerWerff went on to say that \"Moe becomes obsessed with caring for baby Maggie, in ways both hilarious and rooted in the characters we’d grown to know. 'Moe Baby Blues' added a new relationship to the show, and represented one of the few consistently funny episodes this decade.\"\n\nIn February 2012, \"Moe Baby Blues\" was listed by Matt Zoller Seitz of \"New York\" magazine as one of \"Nine Latter-Day \"Simpsons\" Episodes That Match Up to the Early Classics\". DVD Verdict's Victor Valdivia, on the other hand, commented that \"even the best episodes [of season fourteen] don't quite rank with the best of the series' classic seasons, but that doesn't mean that they're not worth watching anyways,\" citing \"Moe Baby Blues\" as an example and adding that it \"gives some much needed humanity to Moe, easily one of the series' most scabrous characters.\" Screen Rant called it the best episode of the 14th season.\n\nJ. Stewart Burns was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award in the animation category for his work on the episode, but lost to Matt Selman, the writer of the \"Simpsons\" episode \"The Dad Who Knew Too Little\". \"The Simpsons\" cast member Hank Azaria won an Emmy Award in the \"Outstanding Voice-Over Performance\" category for his voice-acting work on \"Moe Baby Blues\". It was Azaria's third win in that category and his fourth Emmy Award overall.\n\nThe episode features many references to \"The Godfather\" films. Joe Mantegna, who voices Fat Tony, appeared in \"The Godfather Part III\".\n\n"}

She was the younger sister of Frederick III of Germany (\"Fritz\") and aunt of Wilhelm II of Germany. Louise was seven years younger than Frederick and two years older than his wife, Victoria, Princess Royal.\n\nLouise Marie Elisabeth was born on 3 December 1838 to Prince Wilhelm of Prussia and his wife Princess Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. Louise was named after her grandmothers, Louise, Queen of Prussia and Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia and was known as \"Vivi\" in her family. Her parents were a happy but tense couple, and Louise had only one other sibling,\nPrince Frederick, who was seven years older. Upon her birth, Augusta declared that her duty in perpetuating the Hohenzollern dynasty was complete.\n\nWhile Wilhelm showed some outward affection to his only son, he lavished attention on Louise, and often his unexpected visits to her schoolroom resulted in them playing together on the floor. Mother and daughter however were not close, with Augusta's presence filling Louise up with awe; one account states that when Augusta encountered her daughter, Louise \"involuntarily drew herself up to her full height, and sat stiff and constrained as for her portrait, while she inwardly trembled lest her answers should prove incorrect\". In the early 1850s, Louise was educated by Adèle de Pierre of Neuchâtel.\n\nLouise was betrothed to Frederick, Prince Regent of Baden in 1854, and they married 20 September 1856 at Neues Palais in Potsdam. Frederick had been regent because of his brother Louis's insanity, and was proclaimed Grand Duke of Baden when doctors declared that there was no chance of recovery. As the only daughter of the Prussian crown prince (and later emperor), their marriage caused Baden to gain a great deal of importance, and even more so once the German Empire was founded.\n\nWithin a few weeks of their marriage, the new grand duchess was already pregnant with their first child, Hereditary Grand Duke Frederick. Louise was a happy wife and mother, writing to a friend that \"since we last met, my life has become so much more beautiful, more precious, to me, my happiness is so much richer and deeper than before\".\n\nLouise and Frederick disliked the stiffness of the Karlsruhe court, and gladly escaped to their castle on the island of Mainau. They were popular in Baden, and everyone spoke with affectionate pride of their grand duke and duchess in Constance, where the couple had a summer residence.\n\nLouise was a great friend of Alice, Grand Duchess of Hesse, her sister-in-law's younger sister; i.e., Alice was the sister of Victoria, Louise's brother Frederick's wife, both sisters being daughters of Queen Victoria. The two often visited each other. In Queen Victoria's letters, she and Frederick were always referred to with pleasure or sympathy as \"good Fritz and Louise of Baden\". Though friends as young girls, Louise and her sister-in-law Victoria, Princess Royal (\"Vicky\") always had a \"none-too-friendly rivalry\", particularly when comparing their children: while Vicky's eldest son Crown Prince Wilhelm was born with a deformed arm, Louise apparently could not resist bragging that her three children were healthier and bigger at the same age. Louise doted on her nephew however, and Vicky wrote to her mother that the grand duchess \"spoilt him quite dreadfully\". Often supporting him against his parents, her and Wilhelm's close relationship would carry on to his adulthood, and he would later write in his memoirs that Louise \"possessed considerable political ability and a great gift for organisation, and she understood excellently how to put right men in the right place and how to employ their strength serviceably for the general benefit\". He continued that his aunt \"learned admirably to combine the Prussian element with the Baden character, and she developed into a model sovereign princess\". Louise and Vicky's relations grew even more distant when the former wanted her son Crown Prince Frederick to marry Vicky's niece Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine; the princess instead married Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia, and Louise felt her family had been snubbed. However, Vicky's own son, Wilhelm had too been rejected by Elisabeth, which Louise seemed unaware of.\n\nThe Austro-Prussian War caused a degree of friction between Baden and Prussia, as the former, despite their close familial connections to Berlin, chose to support the Austrians. As the daughter of the Prussian king, Baden was not included in the list of states forced to pay excessive indemnities to Prussia. Her father's strongly anti-Catholic chancellor Otto von Bismarck disliked Baden however, as it was one of Germany's most important Catholic states; he saw its religion as threatening the stability of the new German Empire. Suspicious of the grand duchess' influence on her father, he did his best to block her request for clemency on behalf of Alsace Catholics to the emperor.\n\nBecause of her status as Grand Duchess, Louise was very involved in her duchy's charitable organizations, particularly issues concerning women. She helped found a welfare charity for women called the \"Baden Frauenverein\", which focused on providing hospitals and homes to children. With the support of the \"Women's Association\", Louise founded the first Badenese housewifery school in Karlsruhe, carrying on Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Elder's goal of women receiving special domestic training.\n\nLouise maintained a correspondence with Florence Nightingale, who believed the grand duchess' letters could have been written by \"any administrator in the Crimean War\". The grand duchess also had a lifelong friendship with Clara Barton, whom she met during the Franco-Prussian War. They organized military hospitals, and helped found sewing factories for women to aid the war effort; at Louise's suggestion, Barton was awarded the Iron Cross of Merit after the war by recently crowned Emperor Wilhelm.\nDespite her old age, Louise was present to welcome back wounded German soldiers upon their return to Germany from French prison camps.\n\nWithin two years, four of Louise's closest family members died - her father, brother, younger son and mother. Vicky, now Dowager Empress Frederick, took sympathy on Louise and persuaded her mother to confer Royal Order of Victoria and Albert, First Class, on her.\n\nFrederick died on 28 September 1907, and their eldest son succeeded as Frederick II. That same year, their only daughter Victoria succeeded as Queen consort of Sweden.\n\nLouise, now Dowager Grand Duchess of Baden, lived to see her duchy become absorbed into the new state of Germany under the Revolution of 1918-19 that took place at the end of World War I. At the time of the revolution, her daughter, Queen Victoria of Sweden, was visiting her. After the abdication of the German emperor, riots spread in Karlsruhe on 11 November. The son of a courtier led a group of soldiers up to the front of the palace, followed by a great crowd of people, where a few shots were fired. Louise, as well as the rest of the family, left the palace the backway and left for the Zwingenberg palace in the Neckar valley. By permission of the new government, they were allowed to stay at the Langenstein Palace, which belonged to a Swedish count, Douglas. During these events, Louise was said to have kept her calm and never uttered a word of complaint. The government gave the order that the former Grand Ducal family was to be protected, and that Langenstein be excepted from housing the returning soldiers, because Louise's daughter, the Queen of Sweden, was in their company and Baden should not do anything to offend Sweden. In 1919, the family requested permission from the government to reside in Mainau, and was met with the answer that they were now private citizens and could do as they wished.\n\nThe new republican government gave her permission to live out the rest of her life in retirement at Baden-Baden, where she died on 24 April 1923. She was the last surviving non-morganatic grandchild of Frederick William III of Prussia.\n\nLouise and Frederick had three children:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The ditches are said to be as deep as three metres and were filled with loosened chalk and covered with timber palisade. The 600 foot (184 m) hill is open to the public. From the top, one is able to see to the west Selsey, Chichester Cathedral, the Spinnaker Tower and the Isle of Wight. To the east, one is able to see Brighton, the Seven Sisters and Beachy Head. Cissbury Ring is the highest point in the borough of Worthing.\n\nSeveral Bronze Age barrows have been found just outside Cissbury Ring. In the Romano-British period, farmers settled within the ramparts of the hill fort. \n\nIn 1867–8 Augustus Lane-Fox excavated part of Cissbury Ring.\n\nDuring World War II, Cissbury Ring was used as a camp for the 2nd Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in preparation for the Normandy landings. At this time much of the fort within the ramparts was ploughed to provide food. While on manoeuvres, tanks destroyed the dew pond at the north side of the fort. A gap was made in the ramparts to accommodate a gun which was used to fire at ships in the English Channel and an anti-aircraft gun was sited by the gap.\n\nArtefacts from Cissbury Ring can be found at Worthing Museum and Art Gallery, the Museum of Sussex Archaeology, Lewes and the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. Silver pennies from the reign of Ethelred II (978-1016) can be found at the British Museum.\n\nOnce taken to mean Caesar's fort (after Julius Caesar) or Cissa's fort (after South Saxon king Ælle's son, Cissa), both theories of Cissbury's meaning have been discounted. In the early eleventh century in the reign of Ethelred the Unready, Cissbury was known as 'Sith(m)esteburh', which is taken to mean the 'last or the latest fort'. This may mean that Cissbury was the last fort to be refortified, after another nearby fort such as that at Burpham. It seems that the name Cissbury was altered to accommodate the legend that the fort was linked to Cissa the South Saxon.\n\nLong before the hill was fortified, flint mines were being excavated in the area. Some shafts went down as far as . The shafts at Cissbury were excavated with antler picks, much like those at Grimes Graves and elsewhere. Flint was the common material for making stone axes for felling timber and working wood during the neolithic period.\n\nThe site was one of the first Neolithic flint mines in Britain and it was exploited throughout the period (the nearby Harrow Hill series of flint mines is slightly older). It is part of a group of flint mines in Sussex which followed a rich seam of flint-bearing chalk. Other examples include Grimes Graves in Norfolk, and Harrow Hill nearby.\nCissbury was one of several important mining industries in the UK during the Neolithic and is thought to have been used into the Bronze Age, and later the Iron Age though flint mining probably stopped during the late neolithic, but there is some evidence of re-use of flint for tools during later times. Axes and Blades (struck from cores) account for most of the tools produced at Cissbury and examples of Cissbury flint can be found as far as Italy. Axes were produced on site, as rough-outs, these were then traded or used off site. Many other types of stone were in demand for stone axes such as the greenstone of the Langdale axe industry in the Lake District. The axes were essential for forest clearance for farming in the Neolithic period, and found many other uses, such as wood working.\n\nAround 200 shafts were dug into the Cissbury hill over around 900 years of use. Shafts were up to deep with diameters at the surface. Up to eight galleries extended outwards from the bottoms of the shafts, often interconnecting with one another.\n\nExcavation of the mine shafts by John Pull in the 1950s uncovered the remains of a young woman who had been apparently killed in a tunnel collapse around 2000 BC. Charcoal possibly from her torch and a miniature whale carved from chalk were with her. The possibility that the shaft was used for a ritual burial has also been suggested however. The remains of two other people, a man and a woman, were recovered from different shafts at Cissbury in the nineteenth century and it has been suggested that the exhausted mines had a secondary purpose for formal burial. Alternatively, it may have been expedient to send women into the mines as they could squeeze into the narrow galleries and some archaeologists have suggested that flint extraction was a rite of passage for the more slightly-built juvenile members of Neolithic societies.\n\nThe site is significant as it represents the switch from open cast flint extraction favoured previously by prehistoric peoples who exploited deposits of flint close to the surface, to deep shaft mining which required more effort but produced more flint of a higher quality.\n\nThe site has unimproved chalk grassland, scrub and neutral grassland. Upright brome is dominant in the chalk grassland, while common grasses in the neutral grassland include Yorkshire fog, sheep's fescue and creeping bent. The scrub areas provide important habitats for birds and butterflies.\n\n\n\n"}

He currently works in the Reds' front office.\n\nFor most of his career, the Dominican right-hander was essentially a two-pitch pitcher. He possessed a hard fastball (clocked in the low-to-mid 90s) and complemented it with a baffling circle changeup, both thrown from the three-quarters position. Soto's changeup was particularly effective against left-handed hitters. On occasion, Soto would also throw a slider, which he turned to more in the latter stage of his career. He less frequently threw a curveball.\n\nFrom to , Soto struck out 1,063 batters.\n\nOn May 12, , Soto came very close to throwing a no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals. However, with two out in the top of the ninth inning and the Reds up 1–0, outfielder George Hendrick spoiled the no-hitter with a game-tying solo home run. The Reds won the game for Soto in the bottom of the ninth, 2–1.\n\nIn , Soto finished second in voting for the National League's Cy Young Award. Philadelphia's John Denny was the winner. Statistically, 1983 and 1984 were Soto's best seasons. He compiled a 35–20 record with a 2.92 earned run average and he established himself as the ace of the Cincinnati Reds' rotation. However, the Reds finished with losing records in both seasons.\n\nIn a 12-season career, all for Cincinnati, he was 100–92 with a 3.47 ERA in 297 games, 224 of them starts. He had 72 career complete games and 13 shutouts. He allowed 1,395 hits, 667 earned runs, 657 bases on balls and struck out 1,449 batters in 1,730 innings pitched. He also earned four saves (all during the 1980 season).\n\nBy 1986, Soto's performance had rapidly deteriorated due to shoulder injury. On April 29, 1986, against the Montreal Expos, Soto became the 11th pitcher in major league history to surrender four home runs in an inning.\n\nOn May 27, 1984, against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, third baseman Ron Cey hit what was originally ruled a home run down the left field line. Believing the ball had gone foul, Soto and Reds manager Vern Rapp disputed the call, and during the argument, Soto shoved third-base umpire Steve Rippley, who had made the call. After conferring, the umpires changed their decision and ruled it a foul ball, drawing a protest from the Cubs. However, for shoving Rippley, Soto was ejected, prompting him to charge the field. Cubs coach Don Zimmer stepped in front of Rippley to prevent Soto from attacking the umpire, only to himself be tackled by Soto and (inadvertently) catcher Brad Gulden, which triggered a 10-minute brawl. Four days later, National League president Chub Feeney suspended Mario Soto for five games.\n\nIn the second incident, on June 16, the Reds were playing the Atlanta Braves in Atlanta. Braves player Claudell Washington homered in the first inning off Soto. During Washington's second at-bat, Soto hit Washington in the shoulder with a pitch, but Washington only stared at Soto before going to first. On Soto's first pitch of Washington's third at bat, Washington swung and let go of his bat in the direction of first base and walked toward Soto. Umpire Lanny Harris attempted to intervene, but Washington threw Harris to the ground. Soto punched Washington, and both benches cleared. Reds catcher Dann Bilardello wrestled Washington to the ground and Soto threw the ball at Washington, but he struck Braves coach Joe Pignatano's shin instead. Soto was suspended five games and $5,000, and Washington received a three-game suspension and a $1,000 fine.\n\nIn 2001, Soto was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame and Museum. He has also worked with the team as a pitching coach, helping several Reds pitchers develop a change-up. He currently works in the Reds' front office. Soto is credited as the person who taught Edinson Vólquez and Johnny Cueto their change-ups, which have been go-to strikeout pitches in their careers.\n\n\n"}

The conviction and sentence were denounced as the most draconian punishment for abortion in America in decades.\n\nHis girlfriend, Erica Basoria, was sixteen years old and five months pregnant at the time. She was unable to get an abortion, so after her own attempts to induce miscarriage failed she called upon Flores to try stepping on her midsection. A week later she miscarried.

{"id": "2006826", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2006826", "title": "Capital murder", "text": "Capital murder\n\nCapital murder was a statutory offence of aggravated murder in Great Britain, and Northern Ireland, and the Republic of Ireland, which was later adopted as a legal provision to define certain forms of aggravated murder in the United States. In some parts of the U.S., this term can define certain acts of aggravated murder: a capital murder is any murder that makes the perpetrator eligible for the death penalty.\n\nIn Great Britain, this offence was created by section 5 of the Homicide Act 1957. Previously all murders carried the death penalty on conviction, but the 1957 Act limited the death penalty to the following cases:\nIn all other cases murder carried the mandatory penalty of imprisonment for life.\n\nSection 1 of the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 abolished the separate category of capital murder, and all murders now carry the mandatory penalty of imprisonment for life.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, this offence was created by section 10 of the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1966.\n\nOn the trial of an indictment for capital murder, the jury could not return an alternative verdict to the offence charged in that indictment under section 6(2) of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967.\n\nSections 1(4) and (5) of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973 read:\n\nSee sections 1(1)(b) and 3 of the Criminal Justice Act 1964 (both of which are now repealed) and section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1990.\n\nThe term \"capital murder\" is used in only eight U.S. states; however, 29 states and United States federal government currently allow capital punishment, and each has its own terminology for an offense punishable by death. In most states, the term \"First-Degree Murder\" is used; others may use the term \"Aggravated Murder\" (such as New York, Ohio, Oregon, Utah, and Vermont), and some use simply \"Murder\". The eight states that use the term \"Capital Murder\" are Alabama, Arkansas, California, Kansas, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Texas, and Virginia. The state of Georgia uses the term \"Malice Murder\".\n\nNot all offenses are parallel between the states. In some, first-degree murder is a very broad term defined by a number of circumstances, only a few of which make a defendant eligible for execution. In other jurisdictions, an offense carrying the death penalty is strictly defined and is separate from other, similar crimes.\n\nAlthough legal definitions vary, capital murder in the United States usually means murder involving one or more of the following factors:\n\nSome states may include other factors which amount to capital murder or its legal equivalent.\n\nCapital offenses in the United States are not punishable by death exclusively. Most states afford courts the option of imposing either the death penalty or a life sentence upon conviction, though lesser sentences are rare and in some cases legally impossible. Depending on the state, the presiding judge may determine the sentence, or the decision may be left to the jury.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has placed limitations on the use of the death penalty and has prohibited its use in cases where the offender is mentally incompetent, or was under the age of 18 at the time of the offense.\n"}
