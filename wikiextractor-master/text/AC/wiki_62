It is named after the New England region in northern New South Wales.\n\nFrom 1922 to 2001, New England was usually regarded as a comfortably safe seat for the National Party, formerly the Country Party. Only one Labor candidate has ever won the seat – Frank Foster at the 1906 election and again at the 1910 election, both times on small margins. Since then, the closest Labor has come to winning the seat was in the 1943 landslide, when the Country majority was pared back to an extremely marginal 1.1 percent. It was a marginal seat for most of the 1980s, but since the 1990s Labor has been lucky to get 40 percent of the two-party vote, and has frequently been pushed into third place.\n\nThe seat's best-known member was Ian Sinclair, leader of the National Party from 1984 to 1989, a minister in the Menzies, Holt, McEwen, Gorton, McMahon and Fraser governments and Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives for a few months in 1998. He was succeeded by Stuart St. Clair in the 1998 election.\n\nSt. Clair was then defeated in the 2001 by independent Tony Windsor, who held it until his retirement in 2013.\n\nThe member since the 2013 federal election has been former Queensland Senator Barnaby Joyce, who served as Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and leader of the National Party from 2016 to 2018. Amid the 2017–18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis, the seat was declared vacant on 27 October 2017 by the High Court of Australia arising from Joyce's dual citizenship. Joyce had renounced his dual citizenship effective from August in order to become a sole citizen of Australia and was thus eligible to run for federal parliament. Joyce regained the seat at a by-election on 2 December.\n\nThe division is located in the north-east of New South Wales, adjoining the border with Queensland. The 66,394 km² division covers a largely rural area, with agriculture the main industry. From south to north it includes the regional population centres of Scone, Tamworth, Armidale, Glen Innes, Inverell and Tenterfield.\n\nUnder the original redistribution proposal in 2015, the Australian Electoral Commission announced it intended to abolish Hunter. Electors in the north of Hunter would have joined New England. Ultimately however, the Commission opted for a less radical proposal that saw Charlton abolished, Hunter pushed eastward to absorb most of Charlton's territory, and New England absorbing a few small areas in Hunter's north. Due to changing populations, overall New South Wales lost a seat while Western Australia gained a seat.\n\n"}

Settling in Forli, he was sent on a political mission to Rome. The pope at the time was Paul IV.\n\nIn Rome, he made favorable contacts and had free access to the great libraries where, with sweeping enthusiasm, he studied the classical and medical literature of the Greeks and Romans. His studies of the attitudes of the ancients toward diet, exercise, and hygiene and the use of natural methods for the cure of disease culminated in the publication of his \"De Arte Gymnastica\" (Venice, 1569). With its explanations concerning the principles of physical therapy, it is considered the first book on sports medicine. The illustrations which accompanied the second edition of the work (1573) proved incredibly fertile to the Western imagination regarding the nature of athletics in the Classical world. Modern scholarship has recognized that these illustrations were largely speculative creations of Mercuriale and his collaborators. \n\nThe book \"De Arte Gymnastica\" brought Mercuriale fame. He was called to occupy the chair of practical medicine in Padua in 1569. During this time, he translated the works of Hippocrates, and, armed with this knowledge, wrote \"De morbis cutaneis\" (1572), considered the first scientific tract on skin diseases; \"De morbis muliebribus\" (\"On the diseases of women\") (1582); \"De morbis puerorum\" (\"On the diseases of children\") (1583); \"De oculorum et aurium affectibus\" (\"On the afflictions of eyes and ears\"); and \"Censura e dispositio operum Hippocratis\" (Venice, 1583). In \"De morbis puerorum\", Mercuriali observed contemporary trends in child-rearing. He wrote that women generally finished breastfeeding an infant exclusively after the third month and entirely after around thirteen months.\n\nIn 1573, he was called to Vienna to treat the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II. The emperor, pleased with the treatment he received (although he was to die three years later), made him an imperial count palatine.\n\nHe returned home in the following years; in 1575, the Venetian Senate awarded him a six-year contract as a professor at the University of Padua. Although he was largely hailed as a hero of the city, his reputation would take a sharp turn downwards after his inept handling of the outbreak of plague in Venice in 1576-1577. Mercuriale was summoned by the Venetian government to head a team of medical professionals who would advise about the disease. Arguing against the quarantining and use of lazarettos by the Board of Health, Mercuriale maintained that the disease infecting Venice could not possibly be plague. He and another medical professor, Girolamo Capodivacca, offered to personally treat the sick in Venice on the condition that the quarantines and other precautions put in place by the Board of Health be lifted. The professors and their assistants traveled freely between infected and safe houses, administering treatment, to the horror of the Board of Health and officials in Padua and surrounding cities, who worried the disease would spread. When Mercuriali and Capodivacca began their treatment of the sick in Venice, the death toll had come to a near halt—this was one of the reasons they believed it could not be the true plague. However, by the end of June, the month when they began their work, it rose at an incredible rate. By the beginning of July, the Senate ordered Mercuriale and Capodivacca to be quarantined themselves and it was largely believed that their questionable methods were the reason for the spread of the plague, which eventually claimed 50,000 Venetians.\n\nHowever, Mercuriale salvaged his own reputation in the following years with the 1577 publication of \"De Pestilentia,\" his treatise about the plague, which had been delivered as a series of lectures at the University of Padua.\n\nMercuriale was a prolific writer, though many books were ascribed to him that were compiled from the works of others. He remained in Padua until 1587, when he began teaching at the University of Bologna. In 1593, he was called by Ferdinando de' Medici, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, to Pisa. Cosimo wanted to increase the prestige of the university there and offered a record salary of 1,800 gold crowns, to become 2,000 gold crowns after the second year.\n\nMercuriale returned to Forlì in 1606 and died there a few months later.\n\nAmong his many disciples was the Swiss botanist Gaspard Bauhin and Polish physycian Jan Chrościejewski, the asutor of \"De morbis puerorum\" (1583).\n\nOn 11 March 2009, the Olympic Museum in Lausanne hosted a colloquium given by the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Geneva commemorating the 400th anniversary of the death of Girolamo Mercuriale.\n\n\n\n"}

It conveys water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta through over forty miles of pipelines and canals. It begins in north-eastern Alameda County on the California Aqueduct's Bethany Reservoir serving as the forebay. The aqueduct flows along the eastern and southern edges of the Livermore Valley. Then it flows through a series of tunnels to an end in the foothills of eastern San Jose, 5 miles (8 km) from downtown San Jose, California.\n\nConstruction on the South Bay Aqueduct began in 1960. The Aqueduct was the first delivery system completed under the State Water Project and has been conveying water to Alameda County since 1962 and to Santa Clara County since 1965. The South Bay Aqueduct begins at Bethany Reservoir near Tracy, with the South Bay Pumping Plant lifting water 566 feet into the first reach of the Aqueduct. The South Bay's Pumping Plant's nine pumping units, with a combined capacity of 330 cubic feet per second, discharge water through two parallel buried pipelines to the eastern ridge of the Diablo Range.\n\nFrom there, water flows by gravity for nine miles to the 100 acre-foot Patterson Reservoir, where some water is released for delivery to Livermore Valley. Water flow then continues about nine miles to a junction point where a portion is diverted into a 1 1/2-mile branch line and pumped into Lake Del Valle.\n\nBeyond the Del Valle junction, the water flows by pipeline to La Costa Tunnel, proceeds southwest past Sunol, through the Mission Tunnel, then south through the hills overlooking San Francisco Bay. South Bay Aqueduct terminates in a 160-foot diameter steel tank on a hillside five miles east of downtown San Jose.\n\n\n\n"}

He also traveled to Mexico where he trained in \"lucha libre\".\n\nHe made his professional wrestling debut in 1995 for Michinoku Pro Wrestling (Michinoku Pro/MPW) and became the fourth Tiger Mask, succeeding Koji Kanemoto. While working for Michinoku Pro Tiger Mask won the \"APEX OF TRIANGLE\" Six Man Tag Team Championship with his trainer the Great Sasuke and Gran Hamada. Just over a year into his wrestling career Tiger Mask won the UWA World Middleweight Championship and held it for 3 months before being forced to vacate the title due to an injury. After returning from his injury Tiger Mask spent a couple of years working mid card and lower main event matches until he was finally given another run with a singles title when he won a tournament to crown a new British Commonwealth Jr. Heavyweight Champion in London, England. Despite it being called \"British Commonwealth\", the title was mainly promoted in Japan. Tiger Mask would later vacate the title due to an injury but was given a second reign with the title in 2000 that would last exactly one year shortly before Tiger Mask left Michinoku Pro.\n\nAfter leaving M-Pro, Yamazaki trained with mixed martial artist and fellow Sayama trainee Enson Inoue. Management of Pride Fighting Championships proposed him to compete in mixed martial arts with his mask on, but he declined after receiving a better offer to wrestle for New Japan Pro Wrestling. The same year, there was a suggestion of making Guy Mezger fight at Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye replacing Yamazaki under the Mask, but he similarly refused.\n\nTiger Mask made his NJPW debut on January 20, 2002, and at first wrestled as a Michinoku Pro star and not a full-time worker. In December 2002, he officially joined NJPW, and quickly rose in the contenders ranks in the Junior Heavyweight division. On April 23, 2003, Tiger Mask was booked to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship from then champion Koji Kanemoto. Tiger Mask's first IWGP reign came to an end in December 2003, when he had to vacate the title due to an injury. Tiger Mask returned with renewed strength and won the 2004 Best of the Super Juniors tournament where he beat the then IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion Heat in the semi finals and Koji Kanemoto in the finals to win the annual tournament. It wouldn't be until 2005 that Tiger Mask was able to recreate his semi final victory to defeat Heat for the IWGP Jr. Heavyweight Title. Tiger Mask also won the 2005 Best of the Super Juniors making him the first and to date only wrestler to win the tournament two years in a row. In October 2005 Tiger Mask lost the title to the fourth incarnation of the Black Tiger gimmick (Rocky Romero). Tiger Mask defeated Black Tiger in a rematch on February 19, 2006, in a match where Black Tiger put both the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship and the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship on the line, making Tiger Mask a double champion.\nTiger Mask's reign as IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion ended on May 3, 2006, by the man he won the title from the first time, Koji Kanemoto. the NWA World Junior Heavyweight title would reside around Tiger Mask's waist for over a year until he lost it to Mike Quackenbush on a National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) sanctioned show in Portage, Indiana.\nWhen New Japan decided to create several \"Brands\", Tiger Mask was appointed as an 'ace' of Wrestle Land alongside Hiroshi Tanahashi but ended up wrestling 2 matches under the WRESTLE LAND Brand. In July 2008, Tiger Mask defeated Prince Devitt in a tournament final to become a four-time IWGP World Jr. Heavyweight champion. On the \"Circuit 2008 New Japan Generation\" tour Low Ki ended Tiger Mask's reign. On January 4, 2009, during NJPW's annual Tokyo Dome show Wrestle Kingdom III, he regained the title and became only the third five-time IWGP World Junior Heavyweight champion in the title's history. Tiger Mask made his first successful title defense Jushin Thunder Liger after which he was presented with a third-generation IWGP Junior Heavyweight championship belt. While being presented with the belt he was attacked by new version of Black Tiger, the fifth version of his storyline arch enemy. After defeating and unmasking the fourth Black Tiger (Rocky Romero) at Resolution '09 in a title vs. mask match, the fifth Black Tiger once again attacked Tiger Mask, gave him a Death Valley driver and then unmasked him. On June 20, 2009, at Dominion 6.20, Tiger Mask defeated Black Tiger V in a mask vs. mask match. Afterwards Black Tiger removed his mask to reveal Tatsuhito Takaiwa, the first native under the Black Tiger mask. On August 15, 2009, at \"G1 Climax 2009 Tour\" Tiger Mask lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight title to Místico. He regained the title on November 8, 2009, at NJPW's Destruction '09 show when he defeated Místico. On January 4, 2010, at Wrestle Kingdom IV in Tokyo Dome Tiger Mask lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship to Naomichi Marufuji. After losing a rematch to Marufuji on May 8, 2010, Tiger Mask began showing signs of a heel turn as he attacked the champion after the match. Tiger then entered the 2010 Best of the Super Juniors tournament in an attempt to win his third BOSJ and on May 30 continued his heelish behaviour by refusing to shake hands with La Sombra after losing his opening match to him. The following day it was announced that Tiger had suffered a neck injury and would be sidelined for two months, forcing him to forfeit the rest of his matches in the Best of the Super Juniors tournament.\n\nHe made his return on August 14, 2010, in a six-man tag team match, where he, Koji Kanemoto and Ryusuke Taguchi wrestled Pro Wrestling Noah representatives Atsushi Aoki, Ricky Marvin and Taiji Ishimori to a fifteen-minute time limit draw. On August 22 Tiger and Kanemoto defeated Marvin and Ishimori at a Pro Wrestling Noah event to win the promotion's GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. They would lose the title to Atsushi Aoki and Naomichi Marufuji on December 24, 2010. On January 23, 2011, Tiger Mask put his mask on the line in a Mask vs. Hair match at \"Fantastica Mania 2011\", a New Japan and Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre co–promoted event in Tokyo, and defeated Tomohiro Ishii to win his third \"Lucha de Apuesta\". After the match Ishii attacked and unmasked Tiger Mask. On February 20 at The New Beginning, Tiger Mask defeated Ishii, who had begun wearing a Black Tiger mask, in a Mask vs. Mask match. On June 16, 2012, at Dominion 6.16, Tiger Mask won his first IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, when he and Jushin Thunder Liger defeated Taichi and Taka Michinoku for the vacant title. On July 22, the team lost the title to Forever Hooligans (Alex Koslov and Rocky Romero). On September 23, 2015, at Destruction in Okayama, Tiger Mask defeated Steve Anthony to win the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship for the second time. He lost the title back to Anthony on March 19, 2016.\n\nTiger Mask made several appearances for the American-based wrestling company Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) through the working relationship between NJPW and TNA. He appeared on TNA Sacrifice 2007 in a four-way bout featuring Alex Shelley, Jerry Lynn, and Senshi. He also made a couple of appearances on \"TNA Impact!\", TNA's weekly show.\n\nOutside of wrestling, Yamazaki appeared on the second SASUKE competition in 1998 although he failed to make it past the first obstacle of the First Stage.\n\nOn July 22, 2006, Yamazaki married a then 32-year-old woman whose given name is unknown, though her former surname was Nishimura.\n\n\n"}

There is extremely little documentation of Yameo and Peba, both of which are now extinct, though the town Pebas on the Amazon River clearly takes its name from this group of people. The available documentation is largely due to the efforts of early Catholic missionaries, summarized by Paul Rivet.\n\nLoukotka (1968) also lists Masamae (Mazán, Parara), spoken the Mazán River in Loreto Department, Peru. It is most closely related to Yameo.\n\nJolkesky (2016) groups Peba and Yameo in one branch, and Yagua in another separate branch.\n\nThere is no sound scientific evidence yet that the Peba–Yaguan family is related to any other family or stock of South America (in particular, there is no evidence for grouping it with Cariban languages). There has likely been contact between the Yaguas and Bora–Witotoan peoples, perhaps particularly during the era of the rubber-trade; this may account for some structural similarities between the languages (Payne, forthcoming).

In the original Roman calendar traditionally thought to have been established by Romulus, it was the first day of the year. As the first day of March (\"Martius\"), the month of Mars, it was also the \"Feriae Martis\".\n\nThe date of the festival was associated with the dedication of a temple to Juno Lucina on the Esquiline Hill circa 268 BCE, and possibly also a commemoration of the peace between the Romans and the Sabines. On the day, women would participate in rituals at the temple, although the details have not been preserved other than the observation that they wore their hair loose (when Roman decorum otherwise required them to wear it up), and were not allowed to wear belts or to knot their clothing in any place.\n\nAt home, women received gifts from their husbands and daughters, and Roman husbands were expected to offer prayers for their wives.

It intersects every major north–south street and passes numerous Washington landmarks. It is a landmark itself, long considered the northern boundary of the downtown as well as home of Washington's Embassy Row.\n\nMassachusetts Avenue is tied with Pennsylvania Avenue as the widest road in the District, at . The two roads run in parallel through much of the city, Massachusetts about seven blocks north of Pennsylvania. Massachusetts Avenue was long Washington's premier residential street, as Pennsylvania was once its most sought-after business address. Both streets were named after states with prominent roles in the American Revolution: Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe historic district is an area that includes 150 contributing buildings and 3 contributing structures. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. It includes multiple properties that are individually listed on the National Register.\n\nThe main section of Massachusetts Avenue begins at 19th Street Southeast, just to the west of the former District of Columbia General Hospital site and one block north of Congressional Cemetery. At elevation with respect to the hospital, Massachusetts Avenue commands a view of the Anacostia River. It proceeds in a northwesterly direction crosstown. At Lincoln Park the road enters Northeast D.C. and the neighborhood of Capitol Hill. After briefly converging with Columbus Circle as it curves around Union Station, Massachusetts enters Northwest D.C. in a rapidly changing neighborhood which has transitioned from earlier blight and decay to in the 21st century developing numerous high-rise apartment complexes. In the tradition of the acronym SoHo, realtors sometimes give this area the moniker NoMa (North of Massachusetts Avenue).\n\nIt intersects with Interstate 395 (which runs underground at that point) at H Street NW, and passes over Mount Vernon Square in front of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. Continuing northwest, Massachusetts enters an underpass below Thomas Circle at 14th and M Streets NW, before curving around Scott Circle at 16th and N Streets NW; this is considered the starting point of Embassy Row.\n\nMassachusetts Avenue passes through the inner ring of Dupont Circle and curves north at Sheridan Circle, paralleling Rock Creek to Belmont Road NW. After crossing Rock Creek over the Charles C. Glover Bridge, it curves around the United States Naval Observatory and Number One Observatory Circle, the official residence of the Vice President of the United States, which forms the southwest boundary of the Massachusetts Heights neighborhood. The Washington National Cathedral, located at the intersection of Mass and Wisconsin Avenues, is usually considered the end of Embassy Row.\n\nAt Ward Circle, Massachusetts delineates the American University Park neighborhood from Spring Valley, passing to the north of American University. It crosses the Washington-Montgomery County, Maryland border at Westmoreland Circle. In Maryland, the road continues signed as State Highway 396, meandering through residential sections of Bethesda until terminating at Goldsboro Road (Maryland State Highway 614). Another section of Massachusetts Avenue, discontinuous from the one described above, lies on the east side of the Anacostia River. That section extends from 30th Street SE near District of Columbia Route 295, to Southern Avenue SE at the border between D.C. and Prince George's County.\n\nOther notable institutions located on Massachusetts Avenue include the Postal Square Building (which houses the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the National Postal Museum), The Heritage Foundation, Georgetown University Law Center, the Islamic Center of Washington, the Cato Institute, the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), the Brookings Institution, the Peterson Institute, St. Nicholas Cathedral, and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Numerous embassies and residences are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation makes its home on Massachusetts Avenue.\n\nThe track of the avenue was not paved until the administration of Alexander Robey Shepherd in the early 1870s. It was extended beyond Boundary Road (now Florida Avenue) in the 1880s, and beyond Rock Creek up to the District line after 1900. Residential development along Massachusetts Avenue accelerated in the 1870s, mostly around the circles located west of 9th Street NW. These brick and brownstone structures reflected the Queen Anne, Richardsonian Romanesque, and Château styles in vogue at the time. Later, luxurious Georgian Revival and Beaux-Arts mansions inhabited by wealthy and influential Washingtonians sprouted along the boulevard. The section between Sheridan Circle and Scott Circle became known as \"Millionaires' Row\".\n\nThe Great Depression forced many to relinquish their homes on Millionaires' Row. After World War II, Massachusetts Avenue was seen as less fashionable than newer areas such as upper 16th Street. Many residences were sold and demolished to make way for office buildings, particularly around Dupont Circle and to its east. Many others, however, survived as embassies and society houses; the former Millionaires' Row is today well known as Embassy Row.\n\nSeveral overlapping historic district have been created to preserve the character of the remaining neighborhoods. The Massachusetts Avenue Historic District encompasses all buildings which front the road between 17th Street and Observatory Circle NW.\n\nWhile no Washington Metro lines run along Massachusetts Avenue, the Metrobus N routes serve upper Northwest while a patchwork of routes serve Downtown, Northeast, and Southeast.\n\nThe following Metrobus routes travel along the street (listed from west to east):\n\nThe D.C. Circulator travels along the street:\n\nRide On Route 29 serves Massachusetts Avenue in Maryland from Westmoreland Circle to the avenue's terminus at Goldsboro Road.\n\nThe M6, which travels from the Potomac Avenue Metro station to Fairfax Village, runs along Massachusetts Avenue between Alabama Avenue and Southern Avenue.\n\nThe following Metrorail stations have stops located near Massachusetts Avenue:\n\nUnion Station lies on Massachusetts Avenue at Columbus Circle, and it is served by Amtrak, MARC, and Virginia Railway Express trains.\n\n\n"}

It is located in the eastern San Francisco Bay area south to the Salinas Valley area of northern California, the United States.\n\nThe Diablo Range extends from the Carquinez Strait in the north to Orchard Peak and Polonio Pass in the south, near the point where State Route 46 crosses over the Coast Ranges at Cholame, as described by the USGS. It is bordered on the northeast by the San Joaquin River, on the southeast by the San Joaquin Valley, on the southwest by the Salinas River, and on the northwest by the Santa Clara Valley. The USGS designation is somewhat ambiguous north of the Santa Clara Valley, but on their maps, the range is shown as the ridgeline which runs between its namesake Mount Diablo southeastward past Mount Hamilton. Geologically, the range corresponds to the California Coast Ranges east of the Calaveras Fault in this northern section.\n\nFor much of the length of the Diablo Range, it is paralleled by other sections of the California Coast Ranges to the west, the Santa Cruz Mountains across the southern San Francisco Bay and Santa Clara Valley, and the Santa Lucia Range across the Salinas Valley.\n\nThe range passes through Contra Costa, Alameda, San Joaquin, Santa Clara, Stanislaus, Merced, San Benito, Fresno, Monterey, and Kings Counties, and ends in the northwesternmost extremity of Kern County.\n\nThough the average elevation is about , a summit at over is considered high, mainly because the range is mostly rolling grasslands and plateaus, punctuated by sudden peaks. The plateaus are usually at about . The hills (not including foothills) rising out of valleys rise to about at most, and the hills rolling around inland plateaus go from . Foothills, such as the which are found near the Santa Clara Valley, Livermore Valley and San Joaquin Valley, are lowest, from .\n\nCanyons usually are deep and valleys are deeper but gentler. The peaks often have high topographic prominence because they are typically surrounded by hills, valleys, or lower plateaus. Streams draining the eastern slopes of the Diablo Range include Hospital Creek and Ingram Creek. Stream draining the western slopes include Alameda Creek and Coyote Creek.\n\nThe Diablo Range's following peaks and ridges are between and are distinct landmarks. Mount Diablo (), San Benito Mountain (), Mount Hamilton Ridge (), and Mount Stakes ().\nThe Diablo Range is paralleled for much of its distance by U.S. Route 101 to the west and by I-5 to the east.\nMajor routes of travel through the range include:\n\nA sparsely used gravel road is the highest road in the range, with its highest point being on San Benito Mountain at over 5,000 feet.\n\nThe Diablo Range is largely unpopulated outside of the San Francisco Bay Area. Major nearby communities include Antioch, Concord, Walnut Creek, San Ramon, Pleasanton, Livermore, Fremont, Milpitas, San Jose, Morgan Hill, and Gilroy. and the Central Valley city of Tracy. South of Pacheco Pass, the only major nearby communities (those with a population over 15,000) are Los Banos, and Hollister. The small town of Coalinga may also be notable for its location on State Route 198, one of the few routes through the mountains.\nMost of the range consists of private ranchland, limiting recreational use. However, the range does contain several areas of parkland, including Mount Diablo State Park, Alum Rock Park, Grant Ranch Park, Henry W. Coe State Park, Laguna Mountain Recreation Area, and the BLM's Clear Creek Management Area. In addition, some private land is held in conservation easements by the California Rangeland Trust.\n\nSince the range lies around 10 to 50 miles (16 to 80 km) inland from the ocean, and other coastal ranges like the Santa Lucia Range and the Santa Cruz Mountains block incoming moisture, the range gets little precipitation. In addition, the average elevation of 3,000 feet is not high enough to catch most of the incoming moisture at higher altitudes.\n\nWinters are mild with moderate rainfall, but summers are very dry and hot. Areas above 2,500 feet (762 m) get light to moderate snow in the winter, especially at the highest point, the 5,241 ft (1,597 m) San Benito Mountain in the remote southeastern section of the range. However, though sites at the lower end get annual snowfall, it is typically light and melts too fast to be noticed. Once or twice a decade there is seriously deep and long lasting snowfall.\n\nMercury contamination near the southern end of the range is an ongoing problem, due to the New Idria quicksilver mines, which stopped production in the 1970s. Heavy mercury contamination has been documented in the San Carlos and Silver Creeks, which flow into Panoche Creek, and thence into the San Joaquin River. This has resulted in mercury contamination all the way downstream to the San Francisco Bay. Silver and San Carlos creeks provide a wetland environment in an otherwise arid region and are important for the ecology of the region. As of 2011, New Idria has been listed as a Superfund site and scheduled for cleanup.\n\nThe Diablo Range is part of the California interior chaparral and woodlands ecoregion. It is covered mostly by chaparral and California oak woodland communities, with stands of closed-cone pine forests appearing above 4,000 feet (1,219 m). The savanna has been predominantly replaced by annual Mediterranean grasses, except in some rare habitat fragments. The understory is dominated with nonnative invasives. Blooming in spring are such plants as \"Viola pedunculata\", \"Dodecatheon pulchellum\", \"Fritillaria liliacea\", and \"Ribes malvaceum\", which can be viewed in the Blue Oak Ranch Reserve.\n\nThe range's riparian zones have such trees as bigleaf maple (\"Acer macrophyllum\"), white alder (\"Alnus rhombifolia\"), California bay (\"Umbellularia californica\"), and California sycamore (\"Platanus racemosa\").\n\nThe most common trees are coast live oak (\"Quercus agrifolia\") and blue oak (\"Quercus douglasii\"), with the largest blue oak growing in Alameda County. There are also good populations of California buckeye (\"Aesculus californica\"), and California black oak (\"Quercus kelloggii\"). The gray pine (\"Pinus sabiniana\") and rarer Coulter pine (\"Pinus coulteri\") can be found at all elevations, especially between 800 ft. and 3000 ft. Coulter pine reaches its northern limit on northern of Mt. Diablo. The conifers at higher elevations in the Diablo Range include knobcone pine (\"Pinus attenuata\"), Jeffrey pine (\"Pinus jeffreyi\") and ponderosa pine (\"Pinus ponderosa\").\n\nThe Diablo Range attracts far more raptors than coastal forests, such as red tail hawks. Golden eagle nesting sites are found in the Diablo Range, reaching their highest density in southern Alameda County.\n\nThe Bay checkerspot butterfly, a federally listed threatened species, has habitat in the Range, especially at Mount Diablo. The California tiger salamander (\"Ambystoma californiense\"), also a federally threatened species and a vulnerable species of amphibian native to Northern California, lives in ponds in the range. The northern Pacific rattlesnake is thriving, as are many ground squirrels, hares, and various species of native and nonnative rodents.\n\nTule elk (\"Cervus canadensis ssp. nannodes\") were restored to Mount Hamilton between 1978-1981 and are slowly recovering in several small herds in Santa Clara and Alameda Counties. See Mount Hamilton elk recovery. Black-tailed deer are abundant. Pronghorn, grizzly bears, and wolves were extirpated in the 1800s. There still are numerous coyotes and some of the more vital mountain lion populations in the state. There are excellent populations of bobcats and gray foxes, which depend on the chaparral habitat.\n\nA species of millipede, \"Illacme plenipes\", is endemic to the southern Diablo Range. First described in 1926, then not seen again until 2005, the species has more legs than any other species of millipede, with one specimen having 750.\n\n"}
{"id": "2133492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2133492", "title": "Vapor lock", "text": "Vapor lock\n\nVapor lock is a problem caused by liquid fuel changing state to gas while still in the fuel delivery system of gasoline-fueled internal combustion engines. This disrupts the operation of the fuel pump, causing loss of feed pressure to the carburetor or fuel injection system, resulting in transient loss of power or complete stalling. Restarting the engine from this state may be difficult. \n\nThe fuel can vaporize due to being heated by the engine, by the local climate or due to a lower boiling point at high altitude. In regions where fuels with lower viscosity (and lower boiling threshold) are used during the winter to improve engine startup, continued use of the specialized fuels during the summer can cause vapor lock to occur more readily.\n\nVapor lock was far more common in older gasoline fuel systems incorporating a low-pressure mechanical fuel pump driven by the engine, located in the engine compartment and feeding a carburetor. Such pumps were typically located higher than the fuel tank, were directly heated by the engine and fed fuel directly to the float bowl inside the carburetor. Fuel was drawn under negative pressure (gauge pressure) from the feed line, increasing the risk of a vapor lock developing between the tank and pump. A vapor lock being drawn into the fuel pump could disrupt the fuel pressure long enough for the float chamber in the carburetor to partially or completely drain, causing fuel starvation in the engine. Even temporary disruption of fuel supply into the float chamber is not ideal; most carburetors are designed to run at a fixed level of fuel in the float bowl and reducing the level will reduce the fuel to air mixture delivered to the engine.\n\nCarburetor units may not effectively deal with fuel vapor being delivered to the float chamber. Most designs incorporate a pressure balance duct linking the top of the float bowl with either the intake to the carburetor or the outside air. Even if the pump can handle vapor locks effectively, fuel vapor entering the float bowl has to be vented. If this is done via the intake system, the mixture is, in effect, enriched, creating a mixture control and pollution issue. If it is done by venting to the outside, the result is direct hydrocarbon pollution and an effective loss of fuel efficiency and possibly a fuel odor problem. For this reason, some fuel delivery systems allow fuel vapor to be returned to the fuel tank to be condensed back to the liquid phase, or using an active carbon filled canister where fuel vapor is absorbed. This is usually implemented by removing fuel vapor from the fuel line near the engine rather than from the float bowl. Such a system may also divert excess fuel pressure from the pump back to the tank. \n\nMost modern engines are equipped with fuel injection, and have an electric submersible fuel pump in the fuel tank. Moving the fuel pump to the interior of the tank helps prevent vapor lock, since the entire fuel delivery system is under positive pressure and the fuel pump runs cooler than if it is located in the engine compartment. This is the primary reason that vapor lock is rare in modern fuel systems. For the same reason, some carburetted engines are retrofitted with an electric fuel pump near the fuel tank.\n\nA vapor lock is more likely to develop when the vehicle is in traffic because the under-hood temperature tends to rise. A vapor lock can also develop when the engine is stopped while hot and the vehicle is parked for a short period. The fuel in the line near the engine does not move and can thus heat up sufficiently to form a vapor lock. The problem is more likely in hot weather or high altitude in either case.\n\nGravity feed fuel systems are not immune to vapor lock. Much of the foregoing applies equally to a gravity feed system; if vapor forms in the fuel line, its lower density reduces the pressure developed by the weight of the fuel. This pressure is what normally moves fuel from the tank to the carburetor, so fuel supply will be disrupted until the vapor is removed, either by the remaining fuel pressure forcing it into the float bowl and out the vent or by allowing the vapor to cool and re-condense.\n\nVapor lock has been the cause of forced landings in aircraft. That is why aviation fuel is manufactured to far lower vapor pressure than automotive gasoline (petrol). In addition, aircraft are far more susceptible because of their ability to change altitude and associated ambient pressure rapidly. Liquids boil at lower temperatures when in lower pressure environments.\n\nVapor lock was a common occurrence in stock car racing, since the cars have traditionally used gasoline and carburetors. With the introduction of the fuel injection requirement for NASCAR-sanctioned events in 2012, vapor lock has been largely eliminated.\n\nVapor lock is also less common in other motorsports, such as Formula One and IndyCar racing, due to the use of fuel injection and alcohol fuels (ethanol or methanol), which have a lower vapor pressure than gasoline.\n\nThe higher the volatility of the fuel, the more likely it is that vapor lock will occur. Historically, gasoline was a more volatile distillate than it is now and was more prone to vapor lock. Conversely, diesel fuel is far less volatile than gasoline, so that diesel engines almost never suffer from vapor lock. However, diesel engine fuel systems are far more susceptible to air locks in their fuel lines, because standard diesel fuel injection pumps rely on the fuel being non-compressible. Air locks are caused by air leaking into the fuel delivery line or entering from the tank. Air locks are eliminated by turning the engine over for a time using the starter motor, or by bleeding the fuel system. \n\nModern diesel injection systems have self-bleeding electric pumps which eliminate the air lock problem.\n\n"}

It was initially released as the Access Computer, made by Access Matrix Computer Corporation, but both the company and its product changed names after trademark disputes.\n\nAccess Computer was the common name for the \"Access Matrix\", a transportable personal computer introduced in 1982 by a United States computer company, Access Matrix Corp (AM CORP on FCC documentation).\n\nThe \"Access Computer\" had dual 5.25-inch floppy drives (either 320k-DS or 168k-SS) a detachable keyboard, a 7\" built-in amber CRT monitor, and a built-in 80 CPS Epson MX80 dot matrix printer with GRAFTRAX-80 chipset. It used the CP/M operating system, and also included a Bell-103 300baud modem with both acoustic-coupled and direct connections. Additional connectors for IEEE-488 (external hard disk), composite monitor, RS2-32 serial and Centronics parallel were provided. The mainboard has a 50-pin header designed to support 8-inch disk drives (4 heads on two double-sided disks - drive letters C:/D: and E:/F:)\n\nAccess Matrix came bundled with MBASIC, CBASIC, the Perfect-series office software, Personal Pearl database and Fancy Font markup/formatting system. Custom-written software included a disk format/verify/duplication utility (DISKU.COM) that worked with both the internal A:/B: drives as well as optional external 8\" disks (C:/D: and E:/F:). A custom-written Telecommunications utility (TELCOMU.COM) offered dialup address book, basic terminal emulation, XMODEM/Modem7 file transfer and other features for connection to BBS and other online systems or to operate as a drone to receive files uploaded from other computers.\n\nAlthough not truly portable the all-in-one design did allow for quick setup and shut-down. It was rugged and although weighing 15 kg, it was reasonably easy to transport in a car or in an aircraft's coat- locker. The Access Matrix had option of a padded cloth bag with shoulder-strap or a heavier-duty leather/cloth bound protective case with carry handle and shoulder-strap.\n\nApparently the system was popular with journalists who could use the inbuilt \"OFFLINE\" type-writer mode to create and print simple \"ad hoc\" single-page documents ready for immediate faxing to HQ from their hotel lobby. Another option was to combine the word processing and telecommunications features to create a document using the word processing software and immediately upload the document directly to either an online services such as Compuserve or indeed to another 'waiting' Access Matrix at their head office.\n\nThe rebadged \"Actrix DS\" was presented at the Las Vegas Comdex in November 1983. There was another model called the \"Actrix SS\" with a 170k 5.25-inch disk drive.\n\nHardware:\n\nThe void to the right of the two floppy drives could either be open, for convenient storage of a handful of floppy diskettes, or blanked to conceal one of two options:\nAnother option was a 50-pin connector at the rear of the void, for 8\" disk drives\n\nIf either UPS or 8088 options were present the rear or the void was blanked off with a screw-on plate. If the 50-pin 8\" disk cable option is present the rear of the void is changed to a clip-on panel securing the 50-pin cable connector. \nIf no options were fitted the rear of the floppy void was a blank clip-on panel.\nIf only the 50-pin option is present the floppy void was modified internally with a plastic jacket to prevent stored diskettes from interfering with the rear of the 50-pin header/cable assembly\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, one official distributor of the Actrix Computer range was Richard Carpenter, based in Little Mountain, Queensland. It is believed that Carpenter imported two or three Access Computers as sales tools and demonstrators, but shipped less than a dozen Actrix Computers. In 1986, two demonstrator Actrix machines were repossessed by the financier, NatWest Australia Bank.\n\nExpensive TV advertising and constant lawsuits concerning the product and company-naming rights were drains on capital that speeded the decline and ultimate stop of sales of Actrix machines. Existing orders were filled by one remaining technician, who built the last remaining machines from spare parts.\n\n"}

The company was involved in food distribution to private companies, primarily independent supermarkets, and military commissaries; and the operation of retail stores.\n\nSpartan Stores announced its acquisition of Nash Finch in a $1.3 billion stock-swap in 2013. \n\nThe origins of the Nash Finch Company go back to 1885 when Fred Nash opened a small candy and tobacco shop in the Dakota Territory town of Devils Lake. Soon, Nash opened another store with his two brothers in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Edgar and Willis, the brothers, joined Fred in opening in the late 1880s a fruit distribution business. In 1899, the brothers added Harry Finch as an employee to sort lemons. The brother in 1904 made their first acquisition of a wholesale distributor in Minot, N.D., while Finch head up a Grand Forks, N.D. warehouse. Additional expansions occurs through 1912. A partnership was started with produce brokerage C.H. Robinson Company, which the company took control of. In 1919, the company moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nThe brothers expanded into distribution with operations in Texas and California and had over 60 companies by 1921. In that year, the brother's companies were incorporated into the Nash Finch corporation. In 1922, the company starts selling Nash's Toasted Coffee and other products. Finch was appointed president in 1926. The company started its store brand, Our Family, in 1930s.\n\nIn the 1950s, Nash Finch expanded its customer list to include corporate-owned chains to their existing independent mom-and-pop grocers. A 17-store supermarket chain was purchased in 1954. In St. Cloud, Minn., the company in 1964 starts Warehouse Market, a warehouse-style store.\n\nIn 1976, C.H. Robinson employees bought out Nash Finch becoming an employee owned company. Nash Finch is listed on the Nasdaq in 1983. The company bought M.H. McLean, a North Carolina-based. Thus expanding into southeastern United States in 1984.\n\nA Hispanic-themed grocery, Avanza, is opened by the company in 2002, while organic foods Family Fresh Market store is opened ind 2008. Three distribution centers are acquired by the military division in 2009. Two chains, No Frills stores and Bag 'N Save, were purchased in 2012 with 18 and 12 stores respectively.\n\nIn 2013, Spartan Stores and Nash Finch merged and formed SpartanNash company. The official name change was to occur May 2014, while continuing to operate as Spartan Stores, Nash Finch and MDV in their prior markets. Under terms of the $1.3 billion deal, each Nash share would convert to 1.2 shares of Spartan Stock. Spartan retained 57.7% of the combined company while Nash owns 42.3% of the approximately 38 million outstanding stock shares. Integration and transaction closing-related costs of approximately $17 million to $18 million will be recorded in the quarter ending December 28, 2013.\n\nNash Finch Company, headquartered in Edina, Minnesota (a Minneapolis suburb), was the second largest publicly traded wholesale food distributor in the United States, in terms of revenue, serving the retail grocery industry and the military commissary and exchange systems. Annual sales were approximately $5.2 billion.\n\nThe Company distributed food products and provides support services to a variety of retail formats including conventional supermarkets, military commissaries, multicultural stores and extreme value stores.\n\nNash Finch Company's core business, food distribution, served independent retailers and military commissaries in 36 states, the District of Columbia, Europe, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Azores and Egypt.\n\nNash Finch also operated retail stores under the banners Avanza Supermarket, Bag 'N Save, Econofoods, Family Fresh Market, Family Thrift Center, No Frills Supermarkets (USA), Pick 'n Save, Prairie Market, SunMart Foods, Savers Choice, Wholesale Food Outlet, and Piggly Wiggly.\n"}

This is its only FDA, MHRA and TGA-labelled indication. However, pentoxifylline is also recommended for off-label use as an adjunct to compression bandaging for the treatment of chronic venous leg ulcers by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network) (SIGN) as this has been shown to improve healing rates.\n\nPentoxifylline has also been shown to be of benefit in alcoholic hepatitis, with some studies demonstrating a reduction in risk of hepatorenal syndrome.\n\nCommon side effects are belching, bloating, stomach discomfort or upset, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, dizziness, and flushing. Uncommon and rare side effects include angina, palpitations, hypersensitivity, itchiness, rash, hives, bleeding, hallucinations, arrhythmias, and aseptic meningitis.\n\nContraindications include intolerance to pentoxifylline or other xanthine derivatives, recent retinal or cerebral haemorrhage, and risk factors for haemorrhage.\n\nLike other methylated xanthine derivatives, pentoxifylline is a competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor which raises intracellular cAMP, activates PKA, inhibits TNF and leukotriene synthesis, and reduces inflammation and innate immunity. In addition, pentoxifylline improves red blood cell deformability (known as a haemorrheologic effect), reduces blood viscosity and decreases the potential for platelet aggregation and blood clot formation. Pentoxifylline is also an antagonist at adenosine 2 receptors.\n\nThere is some evidence that pentoxifylline can lower the levels of some biomarkers in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis but evidence is insufficient to determine if the drug is safe and effective for this use. Animal studies have been conducted exploring the use of pentoxifylline for erectile dysfunction and hearing loss. Human studies have been conducted for Peyronie's disease.\n\nPentoxifylline, in combination with tocopherol and clodronate, has been found to heal refractory osteoradionecrosis of the jaw,\nand to be prophylactic against osteoradionecrosis.\n\nIn a Cochrane systematic review on the use of pentoxifylline for intermittent claudication in 2015, the following was concluded \"The quality of included studies was generally low, and very large variability between studies was noted in reported findings including duration of trials, doses of pentoxifylline and distances participants could walk at the start of trials. Most included studies did not report on randomisation techniques or how treatment allocation was concealed, did not provide adequate information to permit judgement of selective reporting and did not report blinding of outcome assessors.

It is useful in certain practical applications, such as recognition of dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) tones produced by the push buttons of the keypad of a traditional analog telephone. The algorithm was first described by Gerald Goertzel in 1958.\n\nLike the DFT, the Goertzel algorithm analyses one selectable frequency component from a discrete signal. Unlike direct DFT calculations, the Goertzel algorithm applies a single real-valued coefficient at each iteration, using real-valued arithmetic for real-valued input sequences. For covering a full spectrum, the Goertzel algorithm has a higher order of complexity than fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms, but for computing a small number of selected frequency components, it is more numerically efficient. The simple structure of the Goertzel algorithm makes it well suited to small processors and embedded applications.\n\nThe Goertzel algorithm can also be used \"in reverse\" as a sinusoid synthesis function, which requires only 1 multiplication and 1 subtraction per generated sample.\n\nThe main calculation in the Goertzel algorithm has the form of a digital filter, and for this reason the algorithm is often called a \"Goertzel filter\". The filter operates on an input sequence formula_1 in a cascade of two stages with a parameter formula_2, giving the frequency to be analysed, normalised to radians per sample.\n\nThe first stage calculates an intermediate sequence, formula_3:\n\nThe second stage applies the following filter to formula_3, producing output sequence formula_5:\nThe first filter stage can be observed to be a second-order IIR filter with a direct-form structure. This particular structure has the property that its internal state variables equal the past output values from that stage. Input values formula_1 for formula_7 are presumed all equal to 0. To establish the initial filter state so that evaluation can begin at sample formula_8, the filter states are assigned initial values formula_9. To avoid aliasing hazards, frequency formula_2 is often restricted to the range 0 to π (see Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem); using a value outside this range is not meaningless, but is equivalent to using an aliased frequency inside this range, since the exponential function is periodic with a period of 2π in formula_2.\n\nThe second-stage filter can be observed to be a FIR filter, since its calculations do not use any of its past outputs.\n\nZ-transform methods can be applied to study the properties of the filter cascade. The Z transform of the first filter stage given in equation (1) is\nThe Z transform of the second filter stage given in equation (2) is\n\nThe combined transfer function of the cascade of the two filter stages is then \nThis can be transformed back to an equivalent time-domain sequence, and the terms unrolled back to the first input term at index formula_12:\nIt can be observed that the poles of the filter's Z transform are located at formula_13 and formula_14, on a circle of unit radius centered on the origin of the complex Z-transform plane. This property indicates that the filter process is marginally stable and vulnerable to numerical-error accumulation when computed using low-precision arithmetic and long input sequences. A numerically stable version was proposed by Christian Reinsch.\n\nFor the important case of computing a DFT term, the following special restrictions are applied.\n\nMaking these substitutions into equation (6) and observing that the term formula_18, equation (6) then takes the following form:\n\nWe can observe that the right side of equation (9) is extremely similar to the defining formula for DFT term formula_19, the DFT term for index number formula_17, but not exactly the same. The summation shown in equation (9) requires formula_21 input terms, but only formula_16 input terms are available when evaluating a DFT. A simple but inelegant expedient is to extend the input sequence formula_1 with one more artificial value formula_24. We can see from equation (9) that the mathematical effect on the final result is the same as removing term formula_25 from the summation, thus delivering the intended DFT value.\n\nHowever, there is a more elegant approach that avoids the extra filter pass. From equation (1), we can note that when the extended input term formula_24 is used in the final step, \n\nThus, the algorithm can be completed as follows:\n\nThe last two mathematical operations are simplified by combining them algebraically:\n\nNote that stopping the filter updates at term formula_33 and immediately applying equation (2) rather than equation (11) misses the final filter state updates, yielding a result with incorrect phase.\n\nThe particular filtering structure chosen for the Goertzel algorithm is the key to its efficient DFT calculations. We can observe that only one output value formula_34 is used for calculating the DFT, so calculations for all the other output terms are omitted. Since the FIR filter is not calculated, the IIR stage calculations formula_35, etc. can be discarded immediately after updating the first stage's internal state.\n\nThis seems to leave a paradox: to complete the algorithm, the FIR filter stage must be evaluated once using the final two outputs from the IIR filter stage, while for computational efficiency the IIR filter iteration discards its output values. This is where the properties of the direct-form filter structure are applied. The two internal state variables of the IIR filter provide the last two values of the IIR filter output, which are the terms required to evaluate the FIR filter stage.\n\nExamining equation (6), a final IIR filter pass to calculate term formula_36 using a supplemental input value formula_37 applies a complex multiplier of magnitude 1 to the previous term formula_38. Consequently, formula_34 and formula_38 represent equivalent signal power. It is equally valid to apply equation (11) and calculate the signal power from term formula_34 or to apply equation (2) and calculate the signal power from term formula_38. Both cases lead to the following expression for the signal power represented by DFT term formula_19:\nIn the pseudocode below, the variables codice_1 and codice_2 temporarily store output history from the IIR filter, while codice_3 is an indexed element of the array codice_4, which stores the input.\n\nIt is possible to organise the computations so that incoming samples are delivered singly to a software object that maintains the filter state between updates, with the final power result accessed after the other processing is done.\n\nThe case of real-valued input data arises frequently, especially in embedded systems where the input streams result from direct measurements of physical processes. Comparing to the illustration in the previous section, when the input data are real-valued, the filter internal state variables codice_1 and codice_2 can be observed also to be real-valued, consequently, no complex arithmetic is required in the first IIR stage. Optimizing for real-valued arithmetic typically is as simple as applying appropriate real-valued data types for the variables.\n\nAfter the calculations using input term formula_27, and filter iterations are terminated, equation (11) must be applied to evaluate the DFT term. The final calculation uses complex-valued arithmetic, but this can be converted into real-valued arithmetic by separating real and imaginary terms:\nComparing to the power-spectrum application, the only difference are the calculation used to finish:\n\nThis application requires the same evaluation of DFT term formula_19, as discussed in the previous section, using a real-valued or complex-valued input stream. Then the signal phase can be evaluated as\n\ntaking appropriate precautions for singularities, quadrant, and so forth when computing the inverse tangent function.\n\nSince complex signals decompose linearly into real and imaginary parts, the Goertzel algorithm can be computed in real arithmetic separately over the sequence of real parts, yielding formula_46, and over the sequence of imaginary parts, yielding formula_47. After that, the two complex-valued partial results can be recombined:\n\n\n\nIn the complexity order expressions, when the number of calculated terms formula_48 is smaller than formula_66, the advantage of the Goertzel algorithm is clear. But because FFT code is comparatively complex,\nthe \"cost per unit of work\" factor formula_51 is often larger for an FFT, and the practical advantage favours the Goertzel algorithm even for formula_48 several times larger than formula_69.\n\nAs a rule-of-thumb for determining whether a radix-2 FFT or a Goertzel algorithm is more efficient, adjust the number of terms formula_16 in the data set upward to the nearest exact power of 2, calling this formula_71, and the Goertzel algorithm is likely to be faster if \n\nFFT implementations and processing platforms have a significant impact on the relative performance. Some FFT implementations perform internal complex-number calculations to generate coefficients on-the-fly, significantly increasing their \"cost K per unit of work.\" FFT and DFT algorithms can use tables of pre-computed coefficient values for better numerical efficiency, but this requires more accesses to coefficient values buffered in external memory, which can lead to increased cache contention that counters some of the numerical advantage.\n\nBoth algorithms gain approximately a factor of 2 efficiency when using real-valued rather than complex-valued input data. However, these gains are natural for the Goertzel algorithm but will not be achieved for the FFT without using certain algorithm variants specialised for transforming real-valued data.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2133579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2133579", "title": "Citrus canker", "text": "Citrus canker\n\nCitrus canker it is a disease affecting \"Citrus\" species caused by the bacterium \"Xanthomonas axonopodis\". Infection causes lesions on the leaves, stems, and fruit of citrus trees, including lime, oranges, and grapefruit. While not harmful to humans, canker significantly affects the vitality of citrus trees, causing leaves and fruit to drop prematurely; a fruit infected with canker is safe to eat, but too unsightly to be sold.\n\nThe disease, which is believed to have originated in Southeast Asia, is extremely persistent when it becomes established in an area. Citrus groves have been destroyed in attempts to eradicate the disease. Brazil and the United States are currently suffering from canker outbreaks.\n\n\"Xanthomonas axonopodis\" is a rod-shaped Gram-negative bacterium with polar flagella. The bacterium has a genome length around 5 megabase pairs. A number of types of citrus canker diseases are caused by different pathovars and variants of the bacterium:\n\nPlants infected with citrus canker have characteristic lesions on leaves, stems, and fruit with raised, brown, water-soaked margins, usually with a yellow halo or ring effect around the lesion. Older lesions have a corky appearance, still in many cases retaining the halo effect. The bacterium propagates in lesions in leaves, stems, and fruit. The lesions ooze bacterial cells that, when dispersed by windblown rain, can spread to other plants in the area. Infection may spread further by hurricanes. The disease can also be spread by contaminated equipment, and by transport of infected or apparently healthy plants. Due to latency of the disease, a plant may appear to be healthy, but actually be infected.\n\nCitrus canker bacteria can enter through a plant's stomata or through wounds on leaves or other green parts. In most cases, younger leaves are considered to be the most susceptible. Also, damage caused by citrus leaf miner larvae (\"Phyllocnistis citrella\") can be sites for infection to occur. Within a controlled laboratory setting, symptoms can appear in 14 days following inoculation into a susceptible host. In the field environment, the time for symptoms to appear and be clearly discernible from other foliar diseases varies; it may be on the order of several months after infection. Lower temperatures increase the latency of the disease. Citrus canker bacteria can stay viable in old lesions and other plant surfaces for several months.\n\"Xanthomonas axonopodis\" has the capability to form a biofilm for attachment on the host. The biofilm is the result of the production of extracellular polysaccharides (xanthan). The biofilm ensures the virulence and epiphytic survival of \"X. axonopodis\" pv. \"citri\" prior to the development of citrus canker. In addition, the bacteria secrete transcriptional activator-like (TAL) effectors through type III secretion system. The effector interacts with host machinery to induce transcription for genes that regulate plant hormones such as gibberellin and auxin.\n\n\"Xanthomonas axonopodis\" pv. \"citri\" overseason in infected area which is canker lesion on leaf or stem. The bacteria ooze out of the lesions when there is free moisture. During the rainy weather, wind-blown rain carries the inoculum to the new susceptible hosts. The bacteria infect new plants through stomata and wounds. The wound can be caused by pruning or hedging that could cut open mesophyll tissues for direct infection. The rain can also cause water congestion on leaf surface, form column of water through stomata and promote infection through the natural opening. The infection can form on fruit, foliage and young stem. Leaves and stems are most susceptible to infection within the first six weeks of initial growth. Infection of fruit is most likely to occur during the 90 day period after petal fall during fruit formation. The varied size of lesions on citrus fruit is because of the multiple cycle of infections and can reflect different-aged lesions on the same fruit.\n\nWind-driven rain plays major role in the dispersal of \"X. axonopodis\". The bacteria are said to be readily dispersed by splashed rain and wind and the quantity of \"X. axonopodis\" declines after the first event of wind-blown rain dispersal. Apart from that, the bacteria also favor warm weather. The cases of citrus canker are more acute in areas that receive high rainfall and high mean temperature such as Florida. Often, cankers emerge briskly during fall, slowly during winter and most rapidly in mid to late spring.\n\nThe disease can be detected in groves and on fruit by the appearance of lesions. Early detection is critical in quarantine situations. Bacteria can be tested for pathogenicity by inoculating multiple citrus species with them. Additional diagnostic tests (antibody detection), fatty-acid profiling, and genetic procedures using polymerase chain reaction can be conducted to confirm diagnosis and may help to identify the particular canker strain. Clara H. Hasse determined that citrus canker was not of fungoid origin but caused by bacterial parasite. Her research published in the 1915 \"Journal of Agricultural Research\" played a major part in saving citrus crops in multiple states.\n\nNot all species and varieties of citrus have been tested for citrus canker. Most of the common species and varieties of citrus are susceptible to it. Some species are more susceptible than others, while a few species are resistant to infection.\nQuarantine measures are implemented in areas where citrus canker is not endemic or has been obliterated to prevent the introduction of \"X. axonopodis.\" On the other hand, in the regions where citrus canker outbreak occurs, Integrated Pest Management(IPM) is utilized. The significant features of this management program is the transposition of susceptible citrus plants to field resistant citrus cultivars. Apart from using the resistant cultivars in fields, there are several measures that are taken to control citrus canker from causing failed crop. The measures can be divided into three major categories which are exclusion, eradication and sanitation.\n\nIn exclusion method, citrus trees or fruits from outside of the country are inspected to ensure they are bacterial-free trees. Under the management program, the production of \"Xac\" (\"X. axonopodis\" pv. \"citri\")-free nursery trees for exclusion of canker from orchard is also mandatory. Because the bacteria can be introduced from the countries with canker issue, strict restrictions on the citrus importation are implemented in citrus-growing countries. Citrus trees will only be grown on canker-free fields for at least one year after effective eradication. The planting sites are also chosen to minimize the favorable environmental condition for the introduction of \"X. axonopodis\". For example, areas with strong wind are avoided to evade the dispersal of bacterial inoculum to the susceptible citrus trees.\n\nOnce citrus canker is introduced into a field, removal of the infected trees is enacted to halt further spread of the bacteria. For instance, in Florida, all citrus trees within 579 m of infected trees must be eradicated.In the process, the infected trees are uprooted and burned. In urban areas, the trees are cut down and chipped, then disposed in the landfills.\n\n\"X. axonopodis\" pv. \"citri\" can be transmitted by mechanical means such as humans and machinery. As a sanitation measure, the workers in citrus orchards are required to do thorough decontamination of personnel and equipment to prevent the spread of bacteria from the infected areas. Aerosol inoculum is able to cause infection in wetted foliage in the zone of bacterial dispersal. Vehicles can also become contaminated by contacting the wet foliage. The contaminated equipments and machines can be disinfected by spraying bactericidal compound.\n\nCitrus canker is thought to have originated in the area of Southeast Asia-India. It is now also present in Japan, South and Central Africa, the Middle East, Bangladesh, the Pacific Islands, some countries in South America, and Florida. Some areas of the world have eradicated citrus canker and others have ongoing eradication programs, but the disease remains endemic in most areas where it has appeared. Because of its rapid spread, high potential for damage, and impact on export sales and domestic trade, citrus canker is a significant threat to all citrus-growing regions.\n\nThe citrus industry is the largest fresh-fruit exporting industry in Australia. Australia has had three outbreaks of citrus canker, all of which have been successfully eradicated. The disease was found twice during the 1900s in the Northern Territory and was eradicated each time. In 2004, an unexplained outbreak occurred in central Queensland. The state and federal governments ordered all commercial groves, all noncommercial citrus trees, and all native lime trees (\"C. glauca\") in the vicinity of Emerald to be destroyed rather than trying to isolate infected trees. Eradication was successful, with permission to replant being granted to farmers by the biosecurity unit of the Queensland Department of Primary Industries in early 2009.\n\nCitrus canker has been detected again in April 2018 and confirmed in May 2018.\n\nCitrus is an important domestic and export crop for Brazil. Citrus agriculture is the second-most important agricultural activity in the state of São Paulo, the largest sweet orange production area in the world. Over 100,000 groves are in São Paulo, and the area planted with citrus is increasing. Of the estimated 2 million trees, greater than 80% are a single variety of orange, and the remainder is made up of tangerine and lemon trees. Because of the uniformity in citrus variety the state has been adversely affected by canker, causing crop and monetary losses. In Brazil, rather than destroying entire groves to eradicate the disease, contaminated trees and trees within a 30-m radius are destroyed; by 1998, over half a million trees had been destroyed.\n\nCitrus canker was first found in the United States in 1910 not far from the Georgia – Florida border. Subsequently, canker was discovered in 1912 in Dade County, more than away. Beyond Florida, the disease was discovered in the Gulf states and reached as far north as South Carolina. It took more than 20 years to eradicate that outbreak of citrus canker, from 1913 through 1931, $2.5 million in state and private funds were spent to control it—a sum equivalent to $28 million in 2000 dollars. In 26 counties, some 257,745 grove trees and 3,093,110 nursery trees were destroyed by burning. Citrus canker was detected again on the Gulf Coast of Florida in 1986 and declared eradicated in 1994.\n\nThe most recent outbreak of citrus canker was discovered in Miami, Dade County, Florida, on September 28, 1995, by Louis Willio Francillon, a Florida Department of Agriculture agronomist. Despite eradication attempts, by late 2005, the disease had been detected in many places distant from the original discovery, for example, in Orange Park, 315 miles (500 km) away. In January 2000, the Florida Department of Agriculture adopted a policy of removing all infected trees and all citrus trees within a 1900-ft radius of an infected tree in both residential areas and commercial groves. Previous to this eradication policy, the department eradicated all citrus trees within 125 ft of an infected one. The program ended in January 2006 following a statement from the USDA that eradication was not feasible.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2133624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2133624", "title": "Laura Nader", "text": "Laura Nader\n\nLaura Nader (born 1930) is an American anthropologist. She has been a Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley since 1960. She was the first woman to receive a tenure-track position in the department. She is also the sister of U.S. activist, consumer advocate, and frequent third-party candidate Ralph Nader, as well as community advocate Shafeek Nader.\n\nNader is a native of Winsted, Connecticut. Her father Nathra owned a restaurant/store in Connecticut, which served as a place for many political discussions. Her mother, Rose, was a schoolteacher who had a strong interest in justice and would express her views in letters to the press. Her older deceased brother, Shafeek; her older sister, Claire and her younger brother, Ralph have all served in public interest careers. Gamal Nkrumah (2005) profiled Dr. Nader in the weekly online news out of Egypt and commented on her loyalties to her father who emigrated from Lebanon for political reasons, “Nader is very much her father's daughter. And it was her elder brother who first suggested she read anthropology at university.\"\n\nNader received a BA in Latin American Studies from Wells College in Aurora, New York in 1952. She received her Ph.D. in Anthropology from Radcliffe College/Harvard in 1961 under the mentorship of Clyde Kluckhohn. Her education included fieldwork in a Zapotec village in Oaxaca, Mexico, and later in South Lebanon.\n\nNader's areas of interest include comparative ethnography of law and dispute resolution, conflict, comparative family organization, the anthropology of professional mindsets and ethnology of the Middle East, Mexico, Latin America and the contemporary United States. She was involved in conferences, determining the direction the study of law in society as a part of society and not insulated and isolated from other human institutions, should take as it developed. Nader edited and published essays from these conferences as well as authoring several books on the anthropology of law, establishing herself as one of the most influential figures in the development of the field. She has been a visiting professor at Yale, Stanford, and Harvard Law Schools. In the 1960s she taught a joint course at Boalt School of Law.\n\nSome of her work focuses on conflict resolution in the Zapotec village she studied. Nader notes that people confront each other face to face on a personal scale. Judges strive to find solutions that are balanced rather than placing one hundred percent of the blame on one party. Nader believes this reflects the society, their economic system, hierarchal structure and any other institution or variable. In contrast, she finds that in the United States, conflict often escalates to polarized blame and violence. The group of people a person may need to confront may be large and impersonal and much more powerful than themselves. She concludes that the kinds of cases people bring to court, reflect areas of stress in the social structure of a community.\n\nHowever, Nader has written extensively about \"harmony ideology,\" the ideology centered around the belief that the existence of conflict is necessarily a bad or dysfunctional thing and that a healthy society is one that achieves harmony between people and minimizes conflict and confrontation. She has argued in her book \"Harmony Ideology\" that harmony ideology has been spread amongst colonized peoples around the world by missionaries prior to (and facilitating) their military colonization and that the Zapotec used it in a \"counter-hegemonic\" way by maintaining the appearance of harmony (while in practice engaging in a great deal of litigation) in order to prevent the Mexican government from interfering with their relative autonomy. Nader has also argued that harmony ideology has been an important basis for unsubstantiated ideas that have developed in the United States since the 1960s about a \"litigation explosion\" and for the development of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as a method for removing so-called \"garbage cases\" (for instance, the then newly appearing civil rights cases of the 1960s) from the courtroom into an arena that emphasizes harmony, compromise and the language of therapy over talk of injustice.\n\nWhile Nader's career began with a strong interest in law and forms of social control, over time she became more interested in questions of cultural control and \"controlling processes\" (also the title of an immensely popular undergraduate course she taught from 1984 until 2010), a concept described further in her 1997 article, \"Controlling Processes: Tracing the Dynamic Components of Power.\"\n\nOne of Nader's best known contributions was in writing the at the time highly controversial \"Up the Anthropologist--Perspectives Gained From Studying Up\" in 1969, which was \"one of the first calls to anthropologists to think more about the 'study of the colonizers rather than the colonized, the culture of power rather than the culture of the powerless, the culture of affluence rather than the culture of poverty.'\" This call led many anthropologists to begin to \"study up,\" although many misinterpreted Nader's call and did not simultaneously study \"down\" and \"sideways.\" Nader's works for the field of anthropology and discipline have led her to be described as \"the embodied moral conscience of post-Boasian American anthropology.\". Her interest in the anthropology of science has developed throughout her career.\n\nNader has coined the term \"trustanoia\" to describe the antonym of paranoia and the state of Americans' feeling of trust of others. She contends that people in the United States trust that there is always someone there to take care of them, and that everyone (including legislators and politicians) acts in their interest.\n\n\nNader is the author or coauthor of over 280 published books and articles, including:\n\n\n"}

It is one of the diagonal avenues radiating from the White House, and the segment south of Florida Avenue was one of the original streets in Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant's's plan for Washington.\nConnecticut Avenue begins just north of the White House at Lafayette Square. It is interrupted by Farragut Square. North of Farragut Square and K Street, Connecticut Avenue is one of the major streets in downtown Washington, with high-end restaurants, historical buildings such as Sedgwick Gardens, hotels, and shopping.\n\nAs Connecticut Avenue approaches the Dupont Circle neighborhood, it splits at N Street into a through roadway and service roadways. The through roadway tunnels under Dupont Circle, while the service roadways intersect the outer roadway of the circle. Just north of the circle, the service roadways are known for their many gay-oriented businesses, of which the most famous is Lambda Rising. The through roadway and service roadways rejoin at R Street. Originally, there was no tunnel, and all vehicular traffic on Connecticut Avenue went through the circle. The tunnel was built in 1949.\n\nAfter crossing Florida Avenue near the Hilton Washington hotel, Connecticut Avenue narrows and winds between the Kalorama neighborhoods. (The Kalorama Triangle district extends eastward from Connecticut, while Sheridan-Kalorama lies to the west.) The avenue then crosses Rock Creek Park on the William Howard Taft Bridge and goes through upper Northwest Washington, D.C., including the Woodley Park, Cleveland Park, and Chevy Chase, D.C. neighborhoods. Between Woodley Park and Cleveland Park, Connecticut Avenue is carried over a deep valley on another bridge. Numerous older, Art Deco high-rise apartment buildings line the 3000 block, with slightly newer apartment buildings in the 4000 and 5000 blocks.\n\nThe National Zoological Park is located along Connecticut Avenue, halfway between the Woodley Park-Zoo/Adams Morgan and Cleveland Park Metro stations. Also located along this stretch of Connecticut Avenue is a major operational center of Intelsat, as are the landmark Wardman Park Marriott Hotel, the city's largest, and the Omni Shoreham Hotel. This section is also a major commuter route and has reversible lanes along most of its length which operate during the morning and evening rush hours (7:00–9:30 a.m. and 4:00–6:30 p.m.). It connects with the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway via 24th Street. Mid-century era high-rise apartments line the avenue, with elegant, older detached homes on shady side streets.\n\nAfter passing the main campus of the University of the District of Columbia near the Van Ness metrorail station, Connecticut Avenue exits the District of Columbia at Chevy Chase Circle, which is at the intersection of Connecticut and Western Avenues. Once entering Maryland, it gains the route designation Maryland State Highway 185 and goes through the Chevy Chase, Maryland postal area. The National 4-H Youth Conference Center is on this stretch of Connecticut Avenue, as is the Chevy Chase Club.\n\nAfter interchanging with the Capital Beltway at Exit 33, Connecticut Avenue enters Kensington, where it is the major north-south street of the central business district. Connecticut Avenue used to end at University Boulevard (Maryland State Highway 193). However, Concord Avenue was extended northward to form an extension of Connecticut Avenue.\n\nThat extension of Connecticut Avenue passes through Wheaton and Aspen Hill. The state route designation ends at Georgia Avenue (Maryland State Highway 97). Connecticut Avenue, now simply a local street, continues past Georgia Avenue and ends at Leisure World Boulevard.\n\nConnecticut Avenue is an arterial route in the National Highway System between K Street and Nebraska Avenue.\n\nThe Red Line of the Washington Metro subway system runs beneath Connecticut Avenue.

Somewhat similar to \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\", the show told the story of the aftermath of a hurricane in which water-based creatures infiltrate a small Florida town and begin to take over the bodies of the town's inhabitants through a cloning process (by first merging with then replacing them). The show was produced by Shaun Cassidy Productions and Warner Bros. Television.\n\nDue to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the aftermath in the southern United States, early on-air promotions were quickly pulled by ABC. The advertising then switched emphasis completely to the alien invasion aspect of the series, while the hurricane received no mention. The premiere was also preceded with a warning that the show featured images of a fictional hurricane to which viewers could be sensitive.\n\nThe show was originally conceived for 5 seasons.\n\n\n\"Invasion\" received mostly positive critical reception. Metacritic gave the season a score of 72, making it generally favorable.\nThe show was nominated on the \"32nd Saturn Awards\" for \"Best Network TV Series\" and \"Best Television Actor\" for William Fichtner.\nIt has been included in many \"gone too soon\" lists. In the independent web critic, Critics at large, the show was reviewed as a Lost Treasure.\n\nIn 2010, to the question \"You’ve played a lot of roles in a lot of different things in TV and Movies, what do you mostly get recognized for?\", William Fichtner said: \"I did a series a couple of years ago, \"Invasion\", that was cancelled after one season and that’s a biggie because I remember at the time everyone was saying that Nielsen ratings were low. This show had no viewers, no one was watching it and that’s got to be in the top 3. A lot of people asking me if it’s coming back, and I’m like 'no, it was 6 years ago, buddy!' That happens a lot, \"Invasion\".\"\n\nOn a chat live between \"Bullz-eye.com\" and Tyler Labine, the actor says: \"\"Invasion\" did get lots of love. Critics loved it. There was quite a huge following by the time we got cancelled. It was just the network didn't love it, that's all.\" He also acclaimed Shaun Cassidy's writing, calling him a \"mad genius\".\n\nLater Labine reiterates his statement about the show's cancellation: \"I still to this day don’t know why that show got canceled. We had great numbers, we had a good show, good critical acclaim… I don’t know. But it was a really fun show.\n\nShaun Cassidy made a similar statement about the show's cancellation: \"I think there were unrealistic expectations that any show following \"Lost\" should do better. But no show after ours ever DID do better, so I suspect some of the execs may have regretted taking our show off the air.\" To the question \"Of all the shows you’ve created that were canceled far too soon, which hurt the most ... and why?\", Cassidy personally picked \"Invasion\" because \"it was the most surprising\".\n\nIn 2017, Eddie Cibrian named \"Invasion\" \"one of my favorite shows to be a part of\".\n\nThe series premiered on ABC on September 21, 2005, and aired for one season. The series included twenty-two episodes, which aired Wednesday evening at 10:00pm. After the show's cancellation there were reports of a possible move to The CW, however, a deal never came to fruition. The final episode aired on May 17, 2006. On August 22, 2006, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment released the complete first season as a six-disc DVD box set.\n\nIn the UK, the show premiered as a double bill on Channel 4, with the third episode shown shortly afterwards on 4's digital sister channel E4. In Bulgaria, \"Invasion\" premiered on February 21, 2007, on Nova Television and in Romania it premiered on March 10, 2009, on Pro Cinema movie channel. In Australia, the series premiered on the Nine Network in March 2006.\n\nAccording to Nielsen ratings, the series premiere garnered 17 million viewers airing after \"Lost\". By the November 30, 2005 episode, the show was only garnering 10 million viewers.\n\nFor the episodes shown on January 11, 18, and 25 the Nielsen Ratings only reached 9.7 million, 9 million and 9.3 million, respectively. It had lost nearly half of the first episode's audience, far behind CBS's \"\", which had 13.7 million, 15.5 million and 14.9 million, for the same period. The show was then put on hiatus for the second time, during which time it was replaced with \"The Evidence\".\n\nIn the \"August 14–20, 2006\" issue of \"TV Guide\", actor Tyler Labine (who played the character Dave Groves) relayed what creator Shaun Cassidy had planned for the following season, saying that Cassidy had said, \"Larkin was going to be presumed dead. Russell and I were going to join forces against Tom. Tom was going to find out that his first wife was alive and running this whole military operation, and she was Szura's boss.\"\n\nWilliam Fichtner (who played the character Tom Underlay) also stated the following about the development of the storyline:\n\n\"There was something in there that I thought that was so good,\" said Fichtner. \"I discovered who it really was who was orchestrating [everything]. I didn't even see it coming from a million miles away. It was my [first wife, Grace], who got on the plane with me. Two people lived after that [1996] plane crash, not just one. She went in another direction altogether. It's amazing. It was, 'ah, what you could have done with that.' \"\n\nIn 2010, Labine gave an interview that detailed some of the ideas for season two and the entire show : \"The idea of the show was we never gonna win. It was a evolutionary step. What was happenning was not a invasion at all, it was a evolutionary step. So we're basically gonna spend 5 seasons tryin' to win this battle we can't win. It was just the end of the human nature -- the human kind -- as we know it.\" He also said: \"Larkin was going to come back as a evolved hybrid and i was going to join a militia to kill her.\"\n\n\"Invasion\" features an orchestral score performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony Orchestra and composed by Jon Ehrlich and Jason Derlatka, incorporating many recurring themes and dramatic melodies. Their music was well received. The soundtrack of the show became available on October 21, 2008 at \"moviescoremedia.com\". The album features more than 60 minutes of carefully selected tracks from the series.\n\n\"Invasion\" is one of Ehrlich and Derlatka's favorite works saying: \"Its always a treat working with a great orchestra.

It follows the novel \"Little Altars Everywhere\". In 2005, Wells wrote \"Ya-Yas in Bloom\" and then \"The Crowning Glory of Calla Lily Ponder\". \"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\" tells the story of the downward spiraling mother-daughter relationship of Vivian Walker and Siddalee Walker.\n\nVivi, also known as \"Queen Dancing Creek,\" is one of the main characters. She is the mother of Siddalee, Lulu, Little Shep and Baylor. She is unhappily married to Shep Walker. Growing up in Thornton, Louisiana with her three best friends, she is the daughter of Mary Katherine \"Buggy\" Abbott and Taylor Abbott. She is physically and emotionally abused by her parents. Vivi is very dramatic and enjoys being the star of any group she is in. She is also deeply scarred by the abuse of her childhood. Vivi's high school sweetheart is Teensy's brother Jacques \"Jack\" Whitman, who is killed during World War II.\nKnown as \"Princess Naked as a Jaybird,\" in the sisterhood, she is the daughter of Genevieve St. Claire Whitman and Mr Whitman. Genevieve acts as a mother figure to the group. Genevieve is from the bayou area and speaks Cajun French when not in earshot of her husband. Teensy is fun-loving and enjoys taking her clothes off—as a child, for play, and as an adult, as part of a striptease act she does for her friends. She is happily married to Chick Claiborne, her high school sweetheart, and has two children, Jack and Genny.\nCrowned \"Countess Singing Cloud,\" Necie is the gentlest, most steady member of the sisterhood. She is known for \"thinking pretty blue and pink thoughts.\" She is the only one of the group to never smoke and to take a Lenten attempt to give up alcohol seriously. She is more religious than the rest of the group. Necie is married with seven children.\nKnown to the Ya-Yas as \"Duchess Soaring Hawk.\" Caro is the most confrontational, hardest member of the group. She often takes care of matters and is the one who comes to Vivi's aid when Vivi \"drops her basket\" as a mother and wife. Caro was married to Blain Brewster with whom she has two children, but he left her for a man he was seeing in the French Quarter. After initially threatening him with an unloaded gun, Caro eventually forgave Blaine, and he and his lover are now an important part of Caro's life. Caro is the Ya-Ya that Sidda reaches out to in order to find out more about the scrapbook her mother sent. She is suffering from emphysema and carries around an oxygen tank for when she needs it. \nOldest daughter of Vivi Walker and fiancé of Conner McGill. Sidda is a play director. After an interview with the New York Times, Sidda and her mother stop speaking to each other. She postpones her engagement to Connor and escapes to a friend's family cabin in Washington State. The Ya-Yas surprise her there and help her to learn why her mother was the way she was while Sidda was growing up. \nSidda's fiancé, whom she loves deeply. He doesn't understand Sidda's constant fear of love, nor why she will not talk to Vivi.\nVivi's husband.

He joined the Air Force to please his father in WWII, but died in a plane crash. \nVivi's mother and wife of Taylor Charles Abbott. She was a devout Catholic and never really loved Taylor and vice versa. Buggy was always jealous of the attention and love Taylor showered upon Vivi, enough to even falsely accuse her of incest as a teenager.\nVivi's father and husband of Mary Katherine Bowman Abbott. He favored Vivi over her mother and gave Vivi a ring on her sixteenth birthday to prove that. He used the belt with his kids.\nSon of Vivi Walker and brother of Sidda. He stops talking to Sidda after the New York Times article. \nSon of Vivi Walker and brother of Sidda. He is the only sibling of Sidda's who still talks to her after the New York Times article.\nDaughter of Vivi Walker and sister of Sidda. She stops talking to Sidda after the New York Times article.\n\nWhen Siddalee and Vivi Walker, an utterly original mother-daughter team, get into a savage fight over a New York Times article that refers to Vivi as a \"tap-dancing child abuser,\" the fall-out is felt from Louisiana to New York to Seattle. Siddalee, a successful theatre director with a huge hit on her hands, panics and postpones her upcoming wedding to her lover and friend Connor McGill. But Vivi's intrepid gang of life-long girlfriends, the Ya-Yas, sashay in and conspire to bring everyone back together.\n\nIn 1932, Vivi and the Ya-Yas were disqualified from a Shirley Temple Look-Alike Contest for unladylike behavior. Sixty years later, they're \"bucking seventy,\" and still making waves. They persuade Vivi to send Sidda a scrapbook of girlhood momentos entitled \"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.\"\n\nSidda retreats to a cabin on Washington State's Olympic Peninsula, tormented by fear and uncertainty about the future, and intent on discovering a key to the tangle of anger and tenderness she feels toward her mother. But the album reveals more questions than answers, and leads Sidda to encounter the unknowable mystery of life and the legacy of imperfect love.\n\nWith passion and a rare gift for language, Rebecca Wells moves from present to past, unraveling Vivi's life, her enduring friendships with the Ya-Yas, and the resulting reverberations on Siddalee. The collective power of the Ya-Yas, each of them totally individual and authentic, permeates this story of a tribe of Louisiana wild women impossible to tame.\n\nDirector Callie Khouri adapted \"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\" into a film in 2002. This became Rebecca Wells' first novel to be adapted into a film. Sandra Bullock (Sidda) and Ellen Burstyn (Vivi) starred as the two main characters of the film as well as James Garner (Big Shep) and Maggie Smith (Caro).\n\n\"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\" became a No. 1 \"New York Times\" bestseller. A number of critics praised the book; \"The Washington Post\" stated that the book is \"A very entertaining and ultimately deeply moving novel about the complex bonds between a mother and a daughter.\"\n\n"}

He is a representative of the stylistic period known as the \"Trecento\", sometimes known as the \"Italian \"ars nova\"\", the transitional period between medieval and Renaissance music in Italy.\n\nNext to nothing is known for certain about his life, but some information can be inferred from his music. He was probably from Padua, and he was a Carmelite, because a picture of him appears in the \"Squarcialupi Codex\" in which he is wearing the garb of that order. Most likely he was in the employ of the Carrara family, since references to them appear in his music. There is a possibility he spent some time in Florence around 1389–1390. References to the Visconti family in his music have been variously interpreted: some scholars have suggested that he was away from Padua, and may have been working in support of Gian Galeazzo Visconti during the period of his campaign of conquest in northern Italy, which included Padua, while more recent scholars have attempted to refute this view, suggesting instead that the references may be either satirical or in support of the Carrara family.\n\nThe \"Squarcialupi Codex,\" the largest source of Italian music of the 14th century, contains 37 pieces by Bartolino. A few other sources contain pieces by him, and his music was evidently widespread, indicating his reputation.\n\nBartolino's music, unlike that of his contemporary Francesco Landini, shows little influence from the French \"ars nova\". His 27 \"ballate\" are almost all vocal duets, in the Italian fashion (the French at that time were mainly writing them as a single vocal line with one or two instrumental accompanying parts). Eleven of Bartolino's madrigals survive; like the \"ballate,\" they are mostly for two voices, however there are two pieces for three, and one of them (La Fiera Testa) has a macaronic text which is trilingual, one strophe in Italian, one in Latin and the final Ritornello section in French. This practice was common in the high Middle Ages but had become rare by the end of the 14th century.\n\n\n"}

Over three decades only preliminary construction has been carried out on the dam. Due to its controversial state, construction was suspended in August 2012 pending World Bank reports. The project was restarted by the Tajik government with Chinese help in 2017. The power plant's first unit was commissioned in November 2018.\n\nThe dam has drawn complaints from neighboring Uzbekistan, which fears it will negatively impact its lucrative cotton crops. The dispute over the project has contributed significantly to bitter relations between the two former Soviet republics.\n\nThe Rogun Dam was first proposed in 1959 and a technical scheme was developed by 1965. Construction began in 1976, however the project stalled after the collapse of the Soviet Union. An agreement on finishing the construction was signed between Tajikistan and Russia in 1994. Since the agreement was not implemented, it was denounced by Tajikistan parliament. In October 2004, an agreement was signed with RUSAL in which RUSAL agreed to complete the Rogun facility, to build a new aluminum plant and to rebuild the Tursunzade Aluminum Smelter. In February 2007, a new partnership between Russia and Tajikistan to complete the dam was announced, but later was refused by Russia because of disagreement concerning the controlling stake in the project. In May 2008, Tajikistan announced that construction of the dam had resumed. By December 2010, one of the river diversion tunnels was renovated and the second expected to commence in June or July 2011. Construction of the dam was suspended in August 2012 pending the World Bank assessment.\n\nIn 2010, Tajikistan launched an IPO to raise US$1.4billion to finish construction of the dam. By April 26 of that year the Tajik government had raised just US$184 million, enough for two years of construction.\nOn July 1, 2016 the state commission in charge of the project had chosen the Italian company Salini Impregilo to carry out the construction for $3.9 billion. The project is broken down into four components, with the most expensive one involving the building of a 335-meter-high rockfill dam which will entail costs of around $1.95 billion.\nOn October 29, 2016 Tajik president Emomali Rahmon officially launched the construction of the dam. At the ceremony, the river's flow was ceremonially diverted through the reconstructed diversion tunnels. The power plant's first unit was commissioned in November 2018 and second turbine is expected to be commissioned by 2019.\nRogun was listed as the highest dam in the world — high — but this is a projected height. In reality the dam was only circa \n\nhigh until 1993 when it was destroyed in a flood. three projects are under consideration: the original, , and two alternatives, and , all having their advantages and drawbacks.\n\nThe hydroelectric power plant is expected to have six turbines with total capacity of 3,600MW. When complete, it is expected to produce 17.1TWh of electrical power per year.\n\nIn response to the request of the bordering countries and especially Uzbekistan, the World Bank has financed the Techno-Economic Assessment Study (TEAS) conducted by consortium of Coyne et Bellier, Electroconsult and IPA Energy + Water Economics, and Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) conducted by Pöyry. The reports, originally slated to be released in February 2012, were delayed until mid-2014. The ESIA was published on 16 June 2014 and the TEAS in July 2014. Overall, the ESIA stated that \"Most impacts are rather small and easily mitigated, if mitigation is required at \nall.\" and that \"There is no impact of the category \"strong negative, mitigation not possible\", \nwhich would have to be considered as a no-go for the project.\" All parties, including Central Asian states met in Almaty in July 2014 for the 5th Riparian Meeting to discuss findings within the TEAS and ESIA.\n\nThe project has raised tensions with Uzbekistan over the impact of the dam on its cotton irrigation systems. In February 2010, Uzbek Prime Minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev sent a letter to his Tajik counterpart demanding an independent examination of the possible consequences of the dam. During October 2010, Uzbek President Islam Karimov called the Rogun hydropower plants a \"stupid project.\"\n\nHowever, in 2018 Uzbekistan dropped its opposition to the Rogun Dam. “Go ahead and build it, but we hold to certain guarantees in accordance with these conventions that have been signed by you,” Uzbek Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Komilov said in a televised appearance on July 5, 2018.\n"}

{"id": "2133681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2133681", "title": "Butyl rubber", "text": "Butyl rubber\n\nButyl rubber, sometimes just called \"butyl\", is a synthetic rubber, a copolymer of isobutylene with isoprene. The abbreviation IIR stands for isobutylene isoprene rubber. Polyisobutylene, also known as \"PIB\" or polyisobutene, (CH), is the homopolymer of isobutylene, or 2-methyl-1-propene, on which butyl rubber is based. Butyl rubber is produced by polymerization of about 98% of isobutylene with about 2% of isoprene. Structurally, polyisobutylene resembles polypropylene, but has two methyl groups substituted on every other carbon atom, rather than one. Polyisobutylene is a colorless to light yellow viscoelastic material. It is generally odorless and tasteless, though it may exhibit a slight characteristic odor.\n\nButyl rubber has excellent impermeability, and the long polyisobutylene segments of its polymer chains give it good flex properties.\n\nThe formula for PIB is:\n–(–CH–C(CH)–)–\n\nThe formula for IIR is:\nIt can be made from the monomer isobutylene (CH=C(CH)) only via cationic addition polymerization.\n\nA synthetic rubber, or elastomer, butyl rubber is impermeable to air and used in many applications requiring an airtight rubber. Polyisobutylene and butyl rubber are used in the manufacture of adhesives, agricultural chemicals, fiber optic compounds, ball bladders, O-rings, caulks and sealants, cling film, electrical fluids, lubricants (2 stroke engine oil), paper and pulp, personal care products, pigment concentrates, for rubber and polymer modification, for protecting and sealing certain equipment for use in areas where chemical weapons are present, as a gasoline/diesel fuel additive, and chewing gum. The first major application of butyl rubber was tire inner tubes. This remains an important segment of its market even today.\n\nIsobutylene was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1825. Polyisobutylene (PIB) was first developed by the BASF unit of IG Farben in 1931 using a boron trifluoride catalyst at low temperatures and sold under the trade name . PIB remains a core business for BASF to this day.\n\nIt was later developed into butyl rubber in 1937, by researchers William J. Sparks and Robert M. Thomas, at Standard Oil of New Jersey's Linden, N.J., laboratory. Today, the majority of the global supply of butyl rubber is produced by two companies, ExxonMobil (one of the descendants of Standard Oil) and Polymer Corporation, a Canadian federal crown corporation established in 1942 to produce artificial rubber to substitute for overseas supply cut off by World War II. It was renamed Polysar in 1976 and the rubber component became a subsidiary, Polysar Rubber Corp. The company was privatized in 1988 with its sale to NOVA Corp which, in turn, sold Polysar Rubber in 1990 to Bayer AG of Germany. In 2005 Bayer AG spun off chemical divisions, including most of the Sarnia site, creating LANXESS AG, also of Germany.\n\nPIB homopolymers of high molecular weight (100,000–400,000 or more) are polyolefin elastomers: tough extensible rubber-like materials over a wide temperature range; with low density (0.913–0.920), low permeability and excellent electrical properties.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, halogenated butyl rubber (halobutyl) was developed, in its chlorinated (chlorobutyl) and brominated (bromobutyl) variants, providing significantly higher curing rates and allowing covulcanization with other rubbers such as natural rubber and styrene-butadiene rubber. Halobutyl is today the most important material for the inner linings of tubeless tires. Francis P. Baldwin received the 1979 Charles Goodyear Medal for the many patents he held for these developments. \n\nIn the spring of 2013 two incidents of PIB contamination in the English Channel, believed to be connected, were described as the worst UK marine pollution 'for decades'. The RSPB estimated over 2,600 seabirds were killed by the chemical and hundreds more were rescued and decontaminated.\n\nPolyisobutylene can be reacted with maleic anhydride to make polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride (PIBSA), which can then be converted into polyisobutenylsuccinimides (PIBSI) by reacting it with various ethyleneamines. When used as an additive in lubricating oils and motor fuels, they can have a substantial effect on the properties of the oil or fuel. Polyisobutylene added in small amounts to the lubricating oils used in machining results in a significant reduction in the generation of oil mist and thus reduces the operator's inhalation of oil mist. It is also used to clean up waterborne oil spills as part of the commercial product Elastol. When added to crude oil it increases the oil's viscoelasticity when pulled, causing the oil to resist breakup when it is vacuumed from the surface of the water.\n\nAs a fuel additive, polyisobutylene has detergent properties. When added to diesel fuel, it resists fouling of fuel injectors, leading to reduced hydrocarbon and particulate emissions. It is blended with other detergents and additives to make a \"detergent package\" that is added to gasoline and diesel fuel to resist buildup of deposits and engine knock.\n\nPolyisobutylene is used in some formulations as a thickening agent.\n\nPolyisobutylene is often used by the explosives industry as a binding agent in plastic explosives such as C-4. Polyisobutylene binder is used because it makes the explosive more insensitive to premature detonation as well as making it easier to handle and mold.\n\nButyl rubber is generally used in speakers, specifically the surrounds. It was used as a replacement for foam surrounds because the foam would deteriorate. The majority of modern speakers use butyl rubber, while most vintage speakers use foam.\n\nButyl rubber is used for the bladders in sporting balls (e.g. Rugby balls, footballs, basketballs, netballs) to provide a tough, airtight inner compartment.\n\nButyl rubber sealant is used for damp proofing, rubber roof repair and for maintenance of roof membranes (especially around the edges). It is important to have the roof membrane fixed, as a lot of fixtures (e.g., air conditioner vents, plumbing, and other pipes) can considerably loosen it.\n\nRubber roofing typically refers to a specific type of roofing materials that are made of ethylene propylene diene monomers (EPDM rubber). It is crucial to the integrity of such roofs to avoid using harsh abrasive materials and petroleum-based solvents for their maintenance.\n\nPolyester fabric laminated to butyl rubber binder provides a single-sided waterproof tape that can be used on metal, PVC, and cement joints. It is used for repairing and waterproofing metal roofs.\n\nButyl rubber is one of the most robust elastomers when subjected to chemical warfare agents and decontamination materials. It is a harder and less porous material than other elastomers, such as natural rubber or silicone, but still has enough elasticity to form an airtight seal. While butyl rubber will break down when exposed to agents such as NH (ammonia) or certain solvents, it breaks down more slowly than comparable elastomers. It is therefore used to create seals in gas masks and other protective clothing.\n\nButyl and bromobutyl rubber are commonly used for manufacturing rubber stoppers used for sealing medicine vials and bottles.\n\nMost modern chewing gum uses food-grade butyl rubber as the central gum base, which contributes not only the gum's elasticity but an obstinate, sticky quality which has led some municipalities to propose taxation to cover costs of its removal.\n\nRecycled chewing gum has also been used as a source of recovered polyisobutylene. Amongst other products, this base rubber has been manufactured into coffee cups and 'Gumdrop' gum-collecting bins. When filled, the collecting bins and their contents are shredded together and recycled again.\n\nButyl rubber and halogenated rubber are used for the innerliner that holds the air in the tire.\n\nPolyisobutylene is used as the primary seal in an insulating glass unit for commercial and residential construction providing the air and moisture seal for the unit.\n\n"}

Upon release, Danzig was the only member of the Misfits receiving royalties for \"Collection I\", along with the 1985 compilation album \"Legacy of Brutality\" and the 1987 live album \"Evilive\".

When the device is small enough, electrons inside the device will create a strong Coulomb repulsion preventing other electrons to flow. Thus, the device will no longer follow Ohm's law and the current-voltage relation of the Coulomb blockade looks like a staircase.\n\nEven though the Coulomb blockade can be used to demonstrate the quantization of the electric charge, it remains a classical effect and its main description does not require quantum mechanics. However, when few electrons are involved and an external static magnetic field is applied, Coulomb blockade provides the ground for a spin blockade (like Pauli spin blockade) and valley blockade, which include quantum mechanical effects due to spin and orbital interactions respectively between the electrons.\n\nThe devices can be composed of either metallic or superconducting electrodes. If the electrodes are superconducting, Cooper pairs (with a charge of minus two elementary charges formula_1) carry the current. In the case that the electrodes are metallic or \"normal-conducting\", i.e. neither superconducting nor semiconducting, electrons (with a charge of formula_2) carry the current.\n\nThe following section is for the case of tunnel junctions with an insulating barrier between two normal conducting electrodes (NIN junctions).\n\nThe tunnel junction is, in its simplest form, a thin insulating barrier between two conducting electrodes. According to the laws of classical electrodynamics, no current can flow through an insulating barrier. According to the laws of quantum mechanics, however, there is a nonvanishing (larger than zero) probability for an electron on one side of the barrier to reach the other side (see quantum tunnelling). When a bias voltage is applied, this means that there will be a current, and, neglecting additional effects, the tunnelling current will be proportional to the bias voltage. In electrical terms, the tunnel junction behaves as a resistor with a constant resistance, also known as an ohmic resistor. The resistance depends exponentially on the barrier thickness. Typically, the barrier thickness is on the order of one to several nanometers.\n\nAn arrangement of two conductors with an insulating layer in between not only has a resistance, but also a finite capacitance. The insulator is also called dielectric in this context, the tunnel junction behaves as a capacitor.\n\nDue to the discreteness of electrical charge, current through a tunnel junction is a series of events in which exactly one electron passes (\"tunnels\") through the tunnel barrier (we neglect cotunneling, in which two electrons tunnel simultaneously). The tunnel junction capacitor is charged with one elementary charge by the tunnelling electron, causing a voltage build up formula_3, where formula_4 is the capacitance of the junction. If the capacitance is very small, the voltage build up can be large enough to prevent another electron from tunnelling. The electric current is then suppressed at low bias voltages and the resistance of the device is no longer constant. The increase of the differential resistance around zero bias is called the Coulomb blockade.\n\nIn order for the Coulomb blockade to be observable, the temperature has to be low enough so that the characteristic charging energy (the energy that is required to charge the junction with one elementary charge) is larger than the thermal energy of the charge carriers. In the past, for capacitances above 1 femtofarad (10 farad), this implied that the temperature has to be below about 1 kelvin. This temperature range is routinely reached for example by 3He refrigerators. Thanks to small sized quantum dots of only few nanometers, Coulomb blockade has been observed next above liquid helium temperature, up to room temperature.\n\nTo make a tunnel junction in plate condenser geometry with a capacitance of 1 femtofarad, using an oxide layer of electric permittivity 10 and thickness one nanometer, one has to create electrodes with dimensions of approximately 100 by 100 nanometers. This range of dimensions is routinely reached for example by electron beam lithography and appropriate pattern transfer technologies, like the Niemeyer–Dolan technique, also known as shadow evaporation technique. The integration of quantum dot fabrication with standard industrial technology has been achieved for silicon. CMOS process for obtaining massive production of single electron quantum dot transistors with channel size down to 20 nm x 20 nm has been implemented.\n\nThe simplest device in which the effect of Coulomb blockade can be observed is the so-called single-electron transistor. It consists of two electrodes known as the \"drain\" and the \"source\", connected through tunnel junctions to one common electrode with a low self-capacitance, known as the \"island\". The electrical potential of the island can be tuned by a third electrode, known as the \"gate\", which is capacitively coupled to the island. \n\nIn the blocking state no accessible energy levels are within tunneling range of an electron (in red) on the source contact. All energy levels on the island electrode with lower energies are occupied.\n\nWhen a positive voltage is applied to the gate electrode the energy levels of the island electrode are lowered. The electron (green 1.) can tunnel onto the island (2.), occupying a previously vacant energy level. From there it can tunnel onto the drain electrode (3.) where it inelastically scatters and reaches the drain electrode Fermi level (4.).\n\nThe energy levels of the island electrode are evenly spaced with a separation of formula_5 This gives rise to a self-capacitance formula_4 of the island, defined as\nTo achieve the Coulomb blockade, three criteria have to be met:\n\nA typical Coulomb blockade thermometer (CBT) is made from an array of metallic islands, connected to each other through a thin insulating layer. A tunnel junction forms between the islands, and as voltage is applied, electrons may tunnel across this junction. The tunneling rates and hence the conductance vary according to the charging energy of the islands as well as the thermal energy of the system.\n\nCoulomb blockade thermometer is a primary thermometer based on electric conductance characteristics of tunnel junction arrays. The parameter V=5.439NkT/e, the full width at half\nminimum of the measured differential conductance dip over an array of N junctions together with the physical constants provide the absolute temperature.\n\nIonic Coulomb blockade (ICB) is the special case of CB, appearing in the electro-diffusive transport of charged ions through sub-nanometer artificial nanopores or biological ion channels. ICB is widely similar to its electronic counterpart in quantum dots, but presents some specific features defined by possibly different valence \"z\" of charge carriers (permeating ions vs electrons) and by the different origin of transport engine (classical electrodiffusion vs quantum tunnelling).\n\nIn the case of ICB, Coulomb gap formula_13 is defined by dielectric self-energy of incoming ion inside the pore/channel formula_14and hence formula_15 depends on ion valence \"z\". ICB appears strong formula_16, even at the room temperature, for ions with formula_17, e.g. for <chem>Ca^2+</chem> ions.\n\nICB has been recently experimentally observed in sub-nanometer <chem>MoS2</chem> pores.\n\nIn biological ion channels ICB typically manifests itself in such valence selectivity phenomena as formula_18 conduction bands (vs fixed charge formula_19) and concentration-dependent divalent blockade of sodium current.\n\n\n"}

He is known for being one of the Ten Promised Paradise.\n\nHis parents were both from the Zuhra clan of the Quraysh tribe in Mecca. His father was 'Awf ibn 'Abd-'Awf and his mother was al-Shifaa bint 'Awf.\n\nHis original name was Abdu Amr (\"servant of Amr\"). It was Muhammad who renamed him 'Abd al-Rahman (\"servant of the Most Merciful\"). It is also said that his original name was Abdul Kaaba. His name has also been transliterated as Abdel Rahman Ibn Auf.\n\nAbu Bakr spoke to 'Abd al-Rahman about Islam, then invited him to meet Muhammad, who heard his declaration of faith and taught him the Islamic prayers. This was before the Muslims had entered the house of Al-Arqam; 'Abd al-Rahman was one of the first eight men to accept Islam.\n\nFrom about 614 the pagan Quraysh in Mecca \"showed their enmity to all those who followed the apostle; every clan which contained Muslims was attacked.\" The usual threat to Muslim merchants was: \"We will boycott your goods and reduce you to beggary.\"\n\n'Abd al-Rahman was one of a pioneering party of fifteen Muslims who emigrated to Abyssinia in 615. Other Muslims joined them later, forming a group of over a hundred. \"They were safely ensconced there and grateful for the protection of the Negus; so they could worship Allah without fear, and the Negus had shown them kind gesture and warm hospitality as was foretold by the prophet even before they departed.\" In late 619 or early 620 \"they heard that the Meccans had accepted Islam.\" This turned out not to be entirely true, however a fair amount of people did accept Islam as a result of the Conversion of Both Umar ibn Khattab and the prophet's own paternal uncle, the Lion himself, Hamza ibn Abdulmuttalib. 'Abd al-Rahman was one of forty who \"set out for the homeland. But when they got near Mecca they learned that the report was false, so that they entered the town under the protection of a citizen or by stealth.\"\n\nIn 615 he migrated to Abyssinia and In 622 'Abd al-Rahman joined the general emigration of Muslims to Medina, where he lodged with Saad ibn Al-Rabi until he could re-establish his business.\n\n'Abd al-Rahman was friends with Umayyah ibn Khalaf, a stern opponent of Islam. When 'Abd al-Rahman emigrated to Medina, the two reached a written agreement, according to which 'Abd al-Rahman was to protect Umayyah's property and family in Medina, while Umayyah would protect 'Abd al-Rahman's in Mecca. When 'Abd al-Rahman wanted to sign the document, Umayyah protested, saying \"I do not know Ar-Rahman\" and requested that the pre-Islamic name \"Abdu Amr\" should be used, to which 'Abd al-Rahman agreed.\n\nThe two met again in the Battle of Badr in March 624.\n\nAbd al-Rahman was one of those who stood firmly beside Muhammad at the Battle of Uhud when most of the warriors fled.\n\nIn August 626 Muhammad directed 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf to raid the Kalb tribe in Daumatul-Jandal, instructing him: “Take it, Ibn Awf; fight everyone in the way of Allah and kill those who disbelieve in Allah. Do not be deceitful with the spoil; do not be treacherous, nor mutilate, nor kill children. This is Allah’s ordinance and the practice of His prophet among you.” Muhammad also instructed him on the correct way to wind a turban. 'Abd al-Rahman defeated the Kalbites and extracted from them their declaration of Islam and the payment of the \"jizya\". He then sealed the alliance by marrying the chief's daughter Tamadur bint Al-Asbagh and bringing her back to Medina.\n\nIn August 634 the dying Caliph Abu Bakr called in 'Abd al-Rahman and Uthman to inform them that he had designated Umar ibn al-Khattab as successor.\n\nIn 644 the dying caliph Umar nominated a board of six members (the Council of Shura) to elect one of themselves as the next caliph. The group consisted of Sad Ibn Abi Waqqas, Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf, Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, Talha ibn Ubayd Allah, Ali ibn Abi Talib and Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman was chosen as the third caliph by 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf.\n\nHis sister was married to Bilal Ibn Rabah.\n\nHe married at least sixteen times and had over thirty known children.\n\nWhen 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf died, he was worth approximately 3.1 billion \"dinars\" which, at current rates of US$40 per gram, i.e. 3.1 billion x 4.25 gram X 40$ is more than US$527 billion because the \"dinar\" was the trading currency at that time. Along with \"dinars\", he left 10,000 goats, 1,000 horses, 1,000 camels and a vast area of land.\n\n'Abd al-Rahman was known as a business sensation in world. When he was asked about the secret of his success, he replied that he never lifted a stone unless he expected to find gold or silver under it.\n\nMany stories are told of 'Abd al-Rahman's personal generosity. He once furnished Muhammad's army with 1,500 camels. He bequeathed 400 \"dinars\" to the survivors of Badr and a large legacy to the widows of Muhammad. One day he brought a caravan of 700 merchant-camels into Medina. Aisha remarked, \"I have heard the Allah's Messenger say: 'I have seen 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf entering Paradise crawling.'\" This was repeated to 'Abd al-Rahman, who replied: \"If I could, I would certainly like to enter Paradise standing. I swear to you, \"yaa Ammah\", that this entire caravan with all its merchandise, I will give in charity.\" And so he did.\n\n'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf was tall and bent-backed with a fine, light, rosy complexion and a handsome face. In old age he did not dye his hair. Other descriptions refer to his curly hair; lustrous, long-lashed eyes; convex nose; somewhat protruding upper teeth; thick hair under the earlobes; long, elegant neck; and thick, masculine hands and fingers. He had a limp due to the wounds that he incurred at the Battle of Uhud.\n\n'Abd al-Rahman died in the Levant (بلاد الشام) in 33 AH (653-654 CE) at the age of 75 (lunar) years. He was buried on a hill to the north-east of present-day Amman, Jordan.\n\nSunnis regard him as one of the \"al-asharatu-l mubashshirin\", the ten people whom Muhammad personally assured of entering Paradise.\n\n"}

It is also used to band together corrugated cardboard, paper, textiles, aluminum and other materials that are processed in the recycling industry. \n\nBaling wire is commonly used in many non-agricultural applications like in the recycling industry. \n\nBaling wire is sometimes used in an informal, make-do manner as an easy fix. It is frequently referred to as one of the basic repair materials. Typical uses range from supporting loose mufflers to patching chain-link fences. Common phrases often include \"baling wire\" as an ad hoc, fix-anything material, alongside chewing gum, duct tape, and the cable tie. \n\nIn the United States, Australia, and around the world, baling wire was used in mechanical hay balers pulled behind a tractor. The automated balers used a wire twister that first cut then twisted the ends of the wire such that the bale kept its shape after the baler had pressed the hay into a tight rectangular bale. These hay balers were in common use up until the late 1980s. When the hay was fed to livestock the wire was cut and often hung in bundles or stored in barrels or metal drums around the farm. Farmers used the soft wire for temporary repairs of almost everything you could think of on the farm, from fences, old leather horse harnesses, head stalls and bridles, to pins to keep castellated nuts in place on the tractor. Even tiny screwdrivers were made by cutting a short length of wire and looping one end for grip. The other end was then flattened and shaped to make a screwdriver for specialized tasks like replacing the tiny screws in reading glasses.\n\nBaling wire was a commonly used product for many years before it was replaced by baling twine in the late 1970s. Small rolls of soft iron wire are readily available and used for tying rebar together and for general utility use.\n\n'Baling wire' is sometimes misspelled as 'bailing wire', but 'bailing' usually refers to a leak or flood, as in bailing out a leaky rowboat with a pail, or bailing out a bank with funds to keep it afloat. \n\nIt is also known as \"haywire,\" from which the term \"go haywire\" arose, referring to crazy or mixed up from the wire's use to fix anything in an ad hoc manner.\n\nIts closest industrial (proper name) is \"Mechanic's Wire\" (Soft Annealed Mechanic's Wire, 18 AWG Industrial Grade). Also sold under the name \"Utility Wire\".\n\n\n"}

He won the Heisman Trophy in 1942 playing for the University of Georgia, making him the first recipient from the Southeastern Conference. In the course of a brief but celebrated career in professional football, Sinkwich was selected for the National Football League Most Valuable Player Award. He coached the Erie (PA) Vets semi-professional football team in 1949. Sinkwich was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1954.\n\nSinkwich is of Croat origin. He was born in Starjak, Croatia (about 12 miles west of Zagreb) as his mother had traveled back to Croatia in 1912. World War I broke out in 1914 and as with many, she and the children remained there for the duration of the war. They returned to the US, going to Youngstown, Ohio when he was two years old, joining his father Ignac (Ignatius) who operated a grocery store. By 1940, the family operated a restaurant in Youngstown. His surname was originally spelled Sinković.\n\nAccording to an article Sinkwich wrote in 1988, he grew to appreciate the value of competitiveness on the streets of Youngstown's west side. \"I learned early in neighborhood pickup games that I had the desire to compete\", he wrote. \"When people ask why I succeeded in athletics, I always tell them that I didn't want to get beat\".\n\nSinkwich gained early recognition as a star athlete at Youngstown's Chaney High School. He went on to the University of Georgia to play under coach Wally Butts where he was a two-time All-America selection. In 1941 he led the nation in rushing yards with 209 carries for 1,103 yards. He set the NCAA single-season total offense record of 2,187 yards and led the Bulldogs to an 11–1 season in 1942, capturing the Southeastern Conference championship and a victory over UCLA in the 1943 Rose Bowl. That same year, the Washington D.C. Touchdown Club honored Sinkwich as \"back of the year\", and he was overwhelmingly voted the \"Number 1 athlete for 1942\" in the annual poll by the Associated Press over second-place finisher Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox, a year in which Williams hit for baseball's triple crown.\n\nThe 1942 season was Sinkwich's first year of backfield-mate Charley Trippi. Georgia defeated Florida 75–0, the worst defeat in the history of Florida football. Sinkwich played with a broken jaw and kicked a field goal in a 19–3 defeat of Florida in 1941.\n\nIn his three-year college career, Sinkwich rushed for 2,271 yards, passed for 2,331 yards, and accounted for 60 touchdowns (30 rushing and 30 passing). Sinkwich earned his Bachelor of Science in Education (B.S.Ed.) from the university in 1943 and was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity.\n\nAfter his collegiate career, Sinkwich joined the United States Marine Corps; however, due to his flat feet he received a medical discharge and proceeded to play with the Detroit Lions, who had selected him first overall in the 1943 NFL Draft. In Detroit, he earned All-Pro honors in 1943–1944, as well as being named as NFL MVP in 1944.\n\nAfter his two years in Detroit, Sinkwich served in both the United States Merchant Marines and the United States Army Air Forces, but a knee injury received while playing for the 2nd Air Force service team in 1945 hampered his playing career when he returned to professional football in 1946 and 1947. He coached the semi-professional Erie (PA) Vets football team in 1949. Sinkwich was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1954.\n\nSinkwich died after a long illness, in Athens, Georgia. Nowhere did his death elicit more emotion than at his alma mater. \"We've lost one of the great legends in football history,\" said then Georgia athletic director Vince Dooley. \"He was not only a great player but a wonderful person and citizen of Athens\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2133799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2133799", "title": "The Blessing Way", "text": "The Blessing Way\n\nThe Blessing Way is the first crime fiction novel in the Joe Leaphorn / Jim Chee Navajo Tribal Police series by Tony Hillerman. First published in 1970, it introduces the character of officer Joe Leaphorn.\n\nTwo anthropology professors from New Mexico plan a summer research trip on the Navajo Reservation. Bergen McKee meets his college friend Joe Leaphorn, now a police officer, there. McKee's interest is the Navajo witches and the role they play in the culture. He learns of one on his first day of interviews, who unexpectedly visits his campsite in the night, beginning a saga of peril for him. Leaphorn has a murdered young man as his case, which intertwines with McKee's encounters with a true Navajo witch.\n\nAnthropologist Bergen McKee comes to the Navajo Reservation to research tales of witches, visiting his college friend, Joe Leaphorn. Leaphorn is a Navajo Tribal Police lieutenant. A young man, Luis Horseman, thinking he had killed a man in a fight, drops out of sight. His victim survives, so Leaphorn spreads the word at a trading post, to induce Luis to come in. McKee and Leaphorn see a tall Navajo man buying a new hat. His old one was stolen, but not the expensive silver concho hatband on it. Leaphorn says that \"Otherwise we'll go in there and get him\", which the stranger hears. The next morning, the body of Luis is found near Ganado, Arizona; he had been suffocated with sand after being killed elsewhere. Leaphorn rues his statement, feeling it led to this murder. McKee and his colleague, J. R. Canfield, begin a joint field trip in the Lukachukai Mountains, the canyons of the west slope. They expect to meet Ellen Leon in Many Ruins canyon, as she seeks her fiancé, Dr. Hall.\n\nThe Tsosie family hosts a Navajo Enemy Way ceremony to deal with depredation of their livestock, which Joe Leaphorn attends. He meets Billy Nez, brother to Luis Horseman. Billy found the hat used as a symbolic scalp of the troublesome witch. From Horseman's aunt Old Woman Gray Rocks he learns the Navajo Wolf is believed to be an outsider from another place. The Tsosie boys had found his camp, parked too far from water. A local man would have known where the water was. Leaphorn finds the tracks of Billy and the man where Billy had taken the hat and realizes Billy will come to kill the man himself. He sets out to stop that. McKee learns in his interviews that there is a Navajo Wolf active now.\n\nNeither Canfield nor his vehicle are at the campsite that evening. Instead, there is a note saying he will return; oddly, he signed the note John, when his name is Jeremy. McKee sleeps outside, waking on hearing unexpected sounds. He moves away from the campsite, to listen. A man wearing a wolf skin and holding an automatic weapon walks into the campsite, then into the tent to read papers there. He calls out McKee's name but McKee keeps silent and the man walks away. In the morning, McKee looks for Miss Leon so they can both drive out quickly. The man in the night left McKee's vehicle inoperable. During the night, McKee slips on the rocks, injuring his right hand painfully. They drive away, escaping the trap being set by the Navajo. McKee finds Canfield's vehicle, and sees his dead body inside it, but does not tell Miss Leon. Not fully grasping their danger, Miss Leon wants to get help for McKee. As they argue, the Navajo returns, with his weapon. He wants McKee to write a letter like the one Canfield left him. McKee's strategy is not to write the letter.\n\nThe tall Navajo sees that McKee cannot write until his hand heals. He takes the pair to an Anasazi pueblo, where his right hand is treated. Eddie, partner to the Navajo, is there, also armed. Left alone in the pueblo, Miss Leon apologizes to McKee for misunderstanding their situation.\n\nWaking in the night, McKee finds a Hopi Kachina in the petroglyph on the wall. He begins digging for the escape exit that Hopis always had to keep from being boxed-in by their enemies. He finds it, and sets a plan in motion for the return of Eddie and George. Miss Leon exits one way, while McKee uses old hand and footholds to reach the level where Eddie is. Eddie shoots Ellen, and then seeks McKee. Eddie falls over the cliff edge into the crevasse, dying from the fall. McKee tends Ellen and seeks Hall for help. He follows electric cable to a side canyon. The Navajo shoots him in the back from a distance. McKee cuts off the insulation and uses it to make a catapult with a sapling, to throw a sharpened pine stake, right into George the Navajo, whose gun sight obscured his view. McKee picks up the Navajo's skin and gun, walking for help. Billy Nez appears with his rifle, and tells McKee to stop. McKee tells him that he is a teacher. They reach Hall at his truck, tell him about Ellen. Hall tells Billy Nez to give up his rifle, while McKee says not to do that. Leaphorn arrives at the scene, telling Billy Nez to hold onto his rifle. Leaphorn already found Ellen Leon, seeing the smoky signal fire she set.\n\nMcKee wakes in the hospital two days later, confessing the two murders to Leaphorn. Ellen Leon recovers from her wounds. Joe Leaphorn tells McKee that Hall killed himself right in front of him, after McKee fainted from loss of blood. Hall was collecting radar data about missiles under test from a federal facility, hoping to sell his information for a huge fee. George, the Navajo from Los Angeles, and Eddie worked for him, keeping people away from his work. From the federal perspective, George and Eddie did not exist; Dr. Canfield and Hall were killed in a car accident, which injured Ellen Leon and McKee. Still recovering, McKee gets a long note from Ellen Leon.\n\n\nThe novel introduces Joe Leaphorn as a secondary character. Anthropologist Bergen McKee draws Leaphorn into the story as an old friend and colleague with whom he consults on Navajo witchcraft culture.\n\nThis story has a strong theme of the Navajo philosophy of keeping peace in life, setting priorities and living by them, against the greed for money represented by Hall and his two hired helpers. Hall is driven to make a million dollars (a lot of money in 1970) and turns to illegal means to do it, hiring one notable criminal (George) and his lesser known ally, both eager for their share if the scheme had worked.\n\nIn his autobiography, Hillerman explained that McKee was the main character, and initially Leaphorn had a minor role. However, at the advice of his editors, he expanded Leaphorn's role.\n\nMarilyn Stasio described the history behind \"The Blessing Way\" in \"The New York Times\":\n\nIn his 2011 book \"Tony Hillerman's Navajoland: Hideouts, Haunts, and Havens in the Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee Mysteries\", author has listed the following 40 geographical locations, real and fictional, mentioned in \"The Blessing Way\". \n\n\"Kirkus Reviews\" wrote that \"authentic anthropological details; the self-effacing courage of McKee; and a particularly exciting entrapment in the canyons of this no white man's land make this an unqualified success.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2133819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2133819", "title": "Oleg Taktarov", "text": "Oleg Taktarov\n\nOleg Nikolaevich Taktarov (; born 26 August 1967) is a Russian actor and retired mixed martial artist. He was a practitioner of sambo and judo and competed in the Ultimate Fighting Championship and Pride Fighting Championships. He won the UFC 6 tournament.. He holds notable wins over Marco Ruas, Tank Abbott, Mark Kerr, and Anthony Macias.\n\nTaktarov started his experience in martial arts at 12, when he took up both judo and sambo. He started competing in those disciplines during his obligatory military service, at one point also becoming a hand-to-hand instructor for the KGB, until he retired at 22 in order to become a businessman. However, according to Taktarov, in 1989 he would find himself attracted to a jacketed mixed martial arts event called Jujutsu Full Contact, whose four first editions he won in dominant fashion. He also trained in jujutsu around this time, becoming a four time European champion. In October 1993, Taktarov and a training partner participated in the White Dragon MMA tournament in Latvia, but were forced to flee from the country due to political tensions. He would land in United States, as he planned to pursue a film acting career, though this would be delayed by his lack of fluency in English language.\n\nIn order to get in touch with Hollywood actors, and having watched the Ultimate Fighting Championship event UFC 2, Taktarov contacted the Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Academy in 1994, offering himself to train Royce Gracie in sambo leglocks. Although he was accepted as a training partner after proving his skill against several instructors, he was ultimately rejected due to his inability to pay the fee. Taktarov next contacted the UFC management in order to participate himself for the prize money, being advised that he was already familiar with that kind of competition and had a chance of winning. He was finally accepted into the UFC 5 tournament in April, and would later find out that the Gracie family had previously pressed to keep him out of UFC. A week before the event, Taktarov dislocated his knee, but he decided not to pull out of the tournament.\n\nTaktarov was billed in the event as \"The Russian Bear,\" a stereotypical nickname invented by his manager, and hailed as a sambo representative, as this was the most exotic martial art in Taktarov's background. However, he stood out for his friendly demeanor, showing an infectious smile to the camera while introducing himself instead of the intimidating faces and postures other fighters were striking. His first fight was against kempo karate expert Ernie Verdicia, whom Oleg quickly submitted by pulling guard, sweeping him between his strikes, and locking an arm triangle choke for the tapout. He advanced round to meet amateur wrestler Dan Severn, but Taktarov's injured knee limited his performance, already disadvantaged by 55 lbs. Severn took the Russian down, passed his guard and blocked him against the cage wall, where Taktarov was repeatedly hit with knee strikes and headbutts while he tried to look for submissions. As the strikes opened a deep cut on Oleg's face, the referee stopped the fight in Severn's favor.\n\nAfter the event, Taktarov went to train with Ken Shamrock in his Lion's Den fighting team. He described this time as: \"For a month Ken and I fought together. The guys who later became good fighters, like Frank Shamrock or Guy Mezger, were not any competition for me at the time. The only guy I trained with was Ken, and we had battles behind closed doors. Nobody was allowed to watch them.\"\n\nTaktarov returned at UFC 6, whose first round saw him facing wrestler and judoka Dave Beneteau. Although Beneteau took Oleg down and stunned him momentarily with punches, Taktarov answered by scoring his own takedown and tapping him out with a guillotine choke in the scramble. His next bout was originally against Patrick Smith, but an injury forced the latter to be replaced by Anthony Macias, who shared promoter and training ground with Taktarov. The Russian submitted him in with another guillotine choke in nine seconds, becoming the fastest submission in UFC history in the process. The fighters were unusually booed by the crowd, who suspected the fight to be a work executed to ease Taktarov's way to the finals. In any case, Taktarov went to the main event of the night, being pitted against the much larger wrestler Tank Abbott in what commentators called a \"skill vs. strength\" match. Both Taktarov and Abbott were already tired and dehydrated by the high altitude of Casper, Wyoming, where the event was taking place.\n\nThe bout was hard-fought, with Abbott dominating the wrestling exchanges and scoring punches while Taktarov remained patient and counterattacked with a variety of strikes and submission attempts. After 17 minutes of back and forth action, with both fighters looking devoid of energy, Taktarov locked a rear naked choke for the tournament victory. He had to be taken to the hospital right after with an oxygen mask on. He was later quoted as, \"when I went to the hospital after the fight, they said I barely had enough water in my system, only about one gallon.\"\n\nBeing the reigning tournament champion, Taktarov was set up to fight reigning UFC Champion Ken Shamrock in UFC 7 for the UFC Superfight Championship. Due to his friendship with Shamrock, Taktarov accepted the fight reluctantly and tried to find a way to win without hurting him, although he was unsure whether Shamrock would do the same. As with the previous fight, Taktarov displayed an important amount of toughness while defending from the bottom, spending most of the match laying defensively on his guard while receiving punishment. The fight had a 30-minute time limit and went into three minutes of overtime, but the result was the same, with Shamrock scoring strikes both standing and through his guard. As there was no judges, the fight finished as a draw.\n\nTaktarov then entered the UFC's Ultimate Ultimate 1995 tournament. He rematched Dave Beneteau, who according to Taktarov came to the match having greased himself to difficult the Russian's grip. Unable to throw him, Taktarov resorted to a flying kneebar, and promptly transitioned it into an ankle lock to submit Beneteau. He then went to face luta livre exponent and highly regarded UFC 7 champion Marco Ruas. The match was lengthy and slow, with Taktarov trying repeatedly to take Ruas to the ground while the Brazilian caused damage with strikes and made Oleg bleed. After the time went out, however, Taktarov won the decision for his superior aggression during the match. Controversy arose when Ruas's manager Frederico Lapenda complained about the decision. Despite Taktarov being tired after the bout, he advanced round and lastly lastly met Dan Severn in the finals in a rematch of their fight at UFC 5. The Russian clamped another leglock combination in the first few minutes, which he claimed Severn was going to tap out to before Taktarov was forced to release it out of fatigue. The wrestler then scored headbutts and knee strikes from dominant positions until the end of the bout, including an overtime controlled by way of boxing, which granted him the decision.\n\nTaktarov ended his UFC career after Ultimate Ultimate, according to him because the management was focused on Shamrock over any other fighter. However, on 21 November 2003, at UFC 45, the UFC conducted a poll amongst the fans to determine the most popular fighters in the history of the UFC. The fans voted Oleg as one of the top 10 most popular fighters in the history of the UFC.\n\nAfter his UFC tenure, Taktarov competed for Japanese promotion Pancrase, where he lost a decision by points to Ryushi Yanagisawa. He then moved to Brazil, where he defeated Joe Charles by submission in World Vale Tudo Championship. There were next talks about a rematch with Marco Ruas, which Taktarov accepted. He even entertained the idea to crash the match with a ringside brawl, which would attract attention by the news media and allow them both to host an anticipated rubber match back in UFC. Ruas's management seemed to get into the idea of setting up a third fight, with his manager Lapenda even making Taktarov promise to fight entirely standing, but Ruas himself fought to win. With one minute left in the clock, Taktarov finally took Ruas down, but he allowed the bout to end in a draw. However, interest was little and the rubber match never happened.\n\nTaktarov returned from Brazil with a broken hand, only to find out his manager had put him on a fight against Renzo Gracie for Martial Arts Reality Superfighting in ten days notice. Come the match, Taktarov took Gracie down, but the anticipated grappling battle never took off. Taktarov's injured hand impeded him from grabbing an opportune leglock on Gracie, who capitalized on the lapse to fire an upkick that knocked down Taktarov. He tried to continue fighting, but the kick had opened a deep cut and the fight was stopped.\n\nIn 1997, Taktarov traveled back to Brazil to fight decorated ADCC grappler Sean Alvarez in the Pentagon Combat event. Despite Alvarez's size advantage, Taktarov knocked him out with newly polished striking skills. However, he got sent to another match in short notice, this time to Japan in the first ever Pride 1 show on 11 October 1997, facing Canadian heavyweight and UFC veteran Gary Goodridge. Taktarov suffered a frightening knockout loss, receiving strikes even after having been rendered unconscious, and had to be carried out of the arena in a stretcher. In one of his recent interviews he attributed Goodridge's victory to the peak of the anabolic steroid cycle that Goodridge allegedly went through prior to the fight. Taktarov further asserted that Goodridge's following performances (i.e. a string of losses) clearly indicated the downtrend of the steroid cycle.\n\nIn Russia, for a specialised event Oleg faced Dolph Lundgren in a celebrity boxing match and won via unanimous decision.\n\nPrior to making a successful comeback to the sport in 2007, Taktarov's last bout was in 2001.\nTaktarov announced in an online radio interview in November 2007 his plans to return to MMA with BodogFight. He won his debut match against John Marsh at 33 seconds into the 2nd round of the match by submission (kneebar). His last fight was against UFC 14 and UFC 15 heavyweight champion Mark Kerr, again winning by kneebar.\n\nTaktarov retired from mixed martial arts with a record of 17 wins, 5 losses, and 2 draws.\n\nIn 1998 Taktarov, who was known as a strong grappler in mixed martial arts, competed in ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championship. He had previously trained with Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners Wallid Ismail, Ricardo Liborio and Carlos Barreto. Taktarov fought a \"superfight\" with multiple champion Mario Sperry, who ultimately defeated Taktarov by points after passing his guard.\n\nAfter temporarily retiring from mixed martial arts, Taktarov focused on his acting career and starred in the movies \"15 Minutes\", \"Bad Boys II\", \"\", \"Air Force One\" and the 2002 version of \"Rollerball\". He also appeared in the first episode of season 3 of \"Alias\" entitled \"The Two\" and in the \"NCIS\" season 5 finale \"Judgement Day\". He has also appeared in a few Russian productions, and was cast in a few releases from 2007, such as \"We Own the Night\". Taktarov also released several instructional Sambo videos and has made an instructional video with Vladimir Vasiliev entitled \"Russian Mega Fighting\". Taktarov more recently starred in Den of Thieves(as Alexi), Robert Rodriguez's franchise reboot, \"Predators\", directed by Nimród Antal.\n\nHe is a leading actor in the Russian television series \"Ex-Wife\".\n\n\nKO PUNCHES\n\n"}

He attended Torrance High School in Torrance, California along with his ex Ratt bandmate Juan Croucier.\n\nBlotzer began his career playing with Don Dokken along with Juan Croucier. Blotzer and Croucier left Dokken in 1978 to form FireFoxx along with Ron Abrams on guitar. He became Ratt's drummer in 1982. Along with bassist Juan Croucier, he had previously played with noted Italian/Swiss guitarist Vic Vergeat, including a tour of the U.S. behind Vergeat's 1981 solo album \"Down to the Bone\". Ratt had five consecutive platinum albums during the 1980s.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s Ratt's popularity waned, and the band called it quits in 1992. Blotzer started a more normal life outside the public eye. Five years later Ratt reformed and toured once again. In 2000 Stephen Pearcy apparently quit the group, and shortly thereafter Bobby had exhibited an extreme dislike for Pearcy, who had sued the band for continuing under the \"Ratt\" name and claimed the band ruined their worldwide deal with Sony. Blotzer heavily denied the claims and said they were a bunch of \"pathologic lies\", adding that Pearcy was a \"sick person\". Blotzer and Ratt guitarist Warren DeMartini subsequently won the court case to use the \"Ratt\" name.\n\nIn 2002 former Ratt guitarist Robbin Crosby died of AIDS-related complications, and heroin overdose, which marked one of the most painful parts of Blotzer's life. Blotzer posted a message to his late bandmate affectionately referred to as \"The King\" by fans on the group's official web site and called Crosby \"one of the most kind hearted, the most compassionate, intelligent, talented\" people he had ever known. \n\nIn 2009 Metal Sludge reported that Blotzer was arrested and booked on charges of domestic violence.\n\nIn 2010 Blotzer released an auto-biographical book, \"Tales of A Ratt – Things You Shouldn't Know\". \nOn September 2, 2012 it was announced Bobby would be joining Geoff Tate's lineup formed after his dismissal from Queensrÿche, but he left on January 25, 2013 to return playing with Ratt.\nIn March 2015, Blotzer guested with Las Vegas band Sin City Sinners. Blotzer asked Sinners' singer Joshua Alan, guitarist Michael \"Doc\" Ellis, and bassist Scott Griffin to join him in forming a new version of RATT. They toured under the name \"Bobby Blotzer's Ratt Experience,\" performing Ratt songs. \nIn September 2015, Blotzer announced that he had taken control of the Ratt brand and would take his band on tour in 2016 using the Ratt name. However, within days, Warren DeMartini spoke out against Blotzer using the name, as he owns half of the Ratt name as part of WBS, Inc., the company owned by him and Blotzer. Blotzer claimed he has the legal right to go on tour using the name, as DeMartini breached his fiduciary duty by refusing to tour under the Ratt name as a partner in the corporation. In October 2015, DeMartini sued Blotzer for falsely advertising his \"tribute band\" as the real thing. In November 2015, DeMartini's attempt to procure an injunction to prevent Blotzer from using and touring under the Ratt trademark was overturned, allowing Blotzer to tour using the name Ratt.\n\nHe has played with several side projects over the years, such as Twenty 4 Seven, Phucket, FireFoxx, Airborne, Angel City Outlaws, Contraband, Vic Vergat Band, and has also played as a touring drummer for Montrose. In 2008, Blotzer, Jani Lane (Warrant), Keri Kelli (Alice Cooper), and Robbie Crane (Ratt) released Saints of the Underground's debut album, \"Love The Sin, Hate The Sinner\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2133823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2133823", "title": "Lam Tin", "text": "Lam Tin\n\nLam Tin is an area in the Kwun Tong District in southeastern New Kowloon, Hong Kong. Lam Tin is primarily a residential area but also hosts a major transport interchange and several shopping attractions. Lam Tin was once a large field in the vicinity of Kowloon Bay. During the Song dynasty, it was a site of salt production. Since the 1980s a number of housing estates were constructed in Lam Tin.\n\nA high-density residential district built on a coastal knoll, Lam Tin hosts residential housing estates, transport infrastructure, mass-transit facilities, shopping centres, recreational areas and many other buildings and structures. It is home to 130,000 residents, making up a fifth of Kwun Tong District's population.\n\nIn common speech, the name Lam Tin in the past usually included the areas of Lei Yue Mun and Yau Tong. However, new infrastructure and housing estates that were built there are not now considered part of Lam Tin. Conventional boundaries of Lam Tin: west to Laguna City, southeast to Kwong Tin Estate, north to the entrance of Tseung Kwan O Tunnel, southwest to Victoria Harbour.\n\nLam Tin is overlooked to the east by Black Hill, or Ng Kwai Shan. The rock below this locality is Hong Kong Granite from the Cretaceous period. Most granite rock in Lam Tin is medium-grained. The granite in Lam Tin is of the Lion Rock suite. Farther towards the shore, a small area of land to the west of Cha Kwo Ling was reclaimed.\n\nThe entire Lam Tin area is located in Kwun Tong District. Politically, Lam Tin is the name of a constituency of Kwun Tong District, which includes the area of the former Lam Tin Estate. However, in common speech, the name Lam Tin usually refers to a larger area which includes nine constituencies of Kwun Tong District.\n\n\nLocated along the coast of southern China, Lam Tin was first settled around the 9th century BC by the Nanyue people. The Qin dynasty conquered the Nanyue in the late 3rd century BC as part of their unification of China. Since then, the land presently known as Lam Tin became identified as part of China.\n\nLam Tin, called Ham Tin Shan () at that time, literally meaning \"salty field hill\", had been part of Kowloon Bay salt-fields (, also known as \"Guanfuchang\" ) under the management of Dongguan County or Xin'an County in different dynasties. The salt-fields were first officially operated by the Song dynasty in 1163.\n\nThe Kowloon Bay salt-fields were rich in salt, and this brought wealth to the residents near the bay. Gradually, Ham Tin Shan became villages. Because of the region's shoreline location, agricultural activities started with the plantation of high-salinity crops. With a quarry found in So Mo Ping (now Sau Mau Ping), the region gradually became a small fishing, farming and quarrying town.\n\nIn 1662, the Kangxi Emperor moved all residents along southern China coastline inland by 50 Chinese miles and abandoned the salt-fields in hopes of weakening the pirate Zheng Chenggong's power through cutting his support from coastline residents. Although the residents were allowed to return in 1669, after the Kangxi Emperor discovered that the migration brought great economic harm, the salt industry in Ham Tin never prospered again.\n\nIn 1841, the British Empire acquired Hong Kong. The western half of the Kowloon Bay salt-fields becoming part of British Hong Kong in 1860 and the eastern half in 1898. In the 20th century, the salt-fields were abandoned for reclamation to facilitate the building of Kai Tak Airport. To reflect this change in land usage, Ham Tin was renamed Lam Tin of similar pronunciation because the village no longer produced salt. The name Lam Tin came from Lantian, Shaanxi, which came from a phrase \"\", literally \"produced from the blue fields is jade\". The name Lam Tin was officially endorsed on 1 September 1970.\nThe colonial government built Lam Tin Estate in the 1960s to settle low-income residents during the influx of population from mainland China after the Korean War. Gradually, Lam Tin became a common term to Hongkongers describing the areas around Lam Tin Estate. The dragon emblem painted on Block 15 of Lam Tin Estate was a symbol of Lam Tin's unity until the building's demolition in 1998. The land of Lam Tin Estate was absorbed into Ping Tin Estate, Kai Tin Estate, Tak Tin Estate and Kwong Tin Estate.\n\nWith the building of three major transport structures in the late 20th century – the Kwun Tong Bypass, the Eastern Harbour Crossing, and the MTR – Lam Tin became even more interconnected with the rest of Hong Kong, spurring a population surge in the district and becoming a major transport interchange.\n\nLam Tin is known as one of the most important transport interchange centres in Hong Kong. It is a frequently visited bus-bus and rail-bus interchange station in East Kowloon.\n\nWhen the British arrived, most Lam Tin residents travelled on foot or by boat to nearby villages such as Ma Tau Wai. Over the years, the government built roads, tunnels and railways in Lam Tin to facilitate transport between Lam Tin and other districts, making Lam Tin a bridge between different areas of Eastern Hong Kong.\n\nThe first road was Lei Yue Mun Road, which succeeded Kwun Tong Road and ran between Kwun Tong and Lei Yue Mun. Cha Kwo Ling Road was later built to tap traffic to Cha Kwo Ling. However, the roads had insufficient capacity to effectively serve the district. Both Lei Yue Mun Road and Kwun Tong Road were widened and became segments of today's Route 7.\n\nThe first road that carried commuters into and out of Lam Tin was Kai Tin Road. It was built in the 1960s to facilitate major road transports. The construction of Kai Tin Road required the blasting of Lam Tin Hill, which attracted much attention to nearby residents. Owing to its method of construction, Kai Tin Road became a direct outlet from the hill.\n\nBuilt together with Kai Tin Road were Ping Tin Street, On Tin Street and Tak Tin Street, which all served Lam Tin Estate. Later Ping Tin and Tak Tin became names of new residential areas after Lam Tin Estate was demolished.\n\nIn 1989 Eastern Harbour Crossing was completed. Kwun Tong Bypass was completed in 1991. To construct an interchange for both roads, the intersection between Lei Yue Mun Road and Kai Tin Road was rebuilt into a flyover-roundabout. This made Lam Tin a bridge between the Eastern Harbour Crossing and the Kwun Tong Bypass of Route 2, with Lei Yue Mun Interchange as the exit point.\n\nIn 1990 Tseung Kwan O Tunnel was built with its southern entrance in Lam Tin, adding a convenient and direct route to Tseung Kwan O. Junk Bay Chinese Permanent Cemetery was built in the same year. Despite being located in Tseung Kwan O, the cemetery's only motor-enabled exit is located in Lam Tin. As a result, Lam Tin becomes crowded with people tending graves during the various festivals.\n\nThe 1990 and 1992 construction of Sceneway Garden and Laguna City, respectively, increased the traffic congestion in the Lam Tin area, mainly near Sai Tso Wan. One of the new arteries built to relieve the problem is Wai Fat Road, a four-lane dual carriageway which serves as an interchange between Route 2 and Route 7 and an outlet from Kwun Tong Bypass to Kwun Tong Industrial Area.\n\nPik Wan Road and Lin Tak Road were also built in 1992 to facilitate transport to newly built areas higher up Lam Tin Hill. Because it hangs off a precipice and carries only two-lanes, Lin Tak Road was surrounded by both questions of convenience and concerns about its safety.\n\nAs part of the 2001 construction of Ocean Shores in Tseung Kwan O, a segment of the former Po Lam Road South was rebuilt and extended to meet Pik Wan Road near Kwong Tin Estate. The reconstructed road was renamed O King Road and became the first road connection to modern Tiu Keng Leng.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1989, the Kwun Tong Line of the MTR terminated at Kwun Tong Station. A storage railroad depot that developed behind the station, consisting of three parallel and interchanged tracks, terminating at Kwun Tong Law Court, eventually became part of the passenger railway after the later extension of Kwun Tong Line.\n\nIn 1984, the government decided to build a second railway tunnel and a second road tunnel to alleviate traffic congestion in the Cross Harbour Tunnel resulting in Eastern Harbour Crossing, the first railway-road tunnel in Hong Kong. The tunnel enabled Kwun Tong Line's extension to Quarry Bay, with an additional stop, Lam Tin, built in the middle. The new MTR station, opened on 8 November 1989, caused an influx of population into Lam Tin.\n\nBuilt at the same was Lam Tin Bus Terminus, located on the opposite side of Lei Yue Mun Road and housing platforms for franchised buses, minibuses, taxis and cross-border buses. It is also connected to Sceneway Plaza by staircases and escalators. Following the construction of these new facilities, Lam Tin gradually became a major transport interchange in Hong Kong.\n\nAs part of the Tseung Kwan O Line project, Kwun Tong line was briefly extended to North Point on 27 September 2001 but soon diverted to Tiu Keng Leng when the Tseung Kwan O Line opened on 18 August 2002. Now, Lam Tin is on the Kwun Tong Line, the third station from the terminus station of Tiu Keng Leng at Rennie's Mill.\n\nThe first bus terminus built in Lam Tin was then called Lam Tin Bus Terminus, which is today's Tak Tin Bus Terminus. It is built on the slope of Lam Tin Hill, in the north part of Lam Tin Estate, to serve the neighbourhood's residents. Buses ran from Kwun Tong to the bus terminus through Lei Yue Mun Road, then turned left and ascended the hill along Kai Tin Road, Ping Tin Street, On Tin Street and Tak Tin Street.\n\nBetween 1989 and 1994, Lam Tin MTR Station, Laguna City and Pik Wan Road were built. To serve these newly populated areas, three new bus termini were constructed: Lam Tin MTR Bus Terminus, now commonly named Lam Tin Bus Terminus as shown on the wall painting of the terminus; Laguna City Bus Terminus, which took up routes originally terminating at Kwun Tong Ferry; and Kwong Tin Bus Terminus, with new routes initiated to serve exclusively Lam Tin and the area nearby.\n\nTo disambiguate the names of the termini from one another, the original Lam Tin Bus Terminus was renamed Lam Tin (North) Bus Terminus, and \"Lam Tin Bus Terminus\" now usually refers to Lam Tin MTR Bus Terminus. After reconstruction of Lam Tin Estate, Lam Tin (North) Bus Terminus was surrounded by Tak Tin Estate. As a result, the terminus got a common name \"Tak Tin Bus Terminus\".\n\nThe area near Ping Tin Street became Ping Tin Estate after the reconstruction. A space underneath the buildings was reserved for a new bus terminus. On 6 July 2003, Ping Tin Bus Terminus was opened and overtook most of the routes from Tak Tin Bus Terminus.\n\nThere are five bus terminals in Lam Tin, namely:\n\n\nExcluding the bus routes mentioned above, the following routes also stop in Lam Tin, but not terminating: 14, 14X, 16M, E22P, E22X, 62X, 259D, 601, 601P, 606, 606A, 606X, 619, 619P, N619, 641, 671, 690, 690P, 694.\n\nSurrounded by hills, Lam Tin does not have direct access to the Victoria Harbour. However, merchant ships and ferries dock at Kwun Tong Pier and Lei Yue Mun Pier, which are both within 15 minutes' walk from Lam Tin, and provide surface transport for Lam Tin residents. Another reason for Lam Tin's absence of an outlet to the Harbour is the presence of an Eastern Harbour Crossing entrance inside the district, whose buses and MTR overtook ferries for cross-harbour transport.\n\nThe first modern housing estate in Lam Tin was Lam Tin Estate. The estate was built in the 1960s and the 1970s to settle the influx of mainland immigrants. The late 1980s saw the district's first private residential buildings. Various facilities built during the 1990s made Lam Tin a compact residential area, however Lam Tin Estate was demolished in the 1990s and was redeveloped into Ping Tin Estate, Tak Tin Estate and Kai Tin Estate.\n\nMost of the residents in Lam Tin are Chinese, but due to an influx of Japanese immigrants during the 1990s, people of Japanese descent have become common in Lam Tin, particularly in Sceneway Garden and Laguna City, which now features a Japanese kindergarten.\n\nLam Tin Estate consisted of tower blocks numbered 1 to 24. Blocks 1 to 14 of Lam Tin Estate were built between 1962 and 1965 as type 4 public housing buildings (第四型公屋); the other 10 towers were built between 1969 and 1975 as type 6 public housing buildings (第六型公屋). There was no Block 9, leaving the number of buildings in Lam Tin Estate at 23.\n\nThe Chinese dragon, which has symbolised unity of Chinese people since it was the first national emblem of unified China, is painted in multicolour on Block 15's south and north facing walls because it was the 500th public housing building in Hong Kong. Block 15's distinctive imagery made it a recognisable symbol of Lam Tin and the district's unity. After demolition and reconstruction, Block 15 became part of Ping Tin Estate.\n\nBuilding structure of Lam Tin Estate's blocks is standardised by the government. As types 3, 4 and 6 buildings, the 23 towers of Lam Tin Estate were shaped as cuboids and resembled candy-boxes standing on a knoll. Most buildings were 16-storeys high and housed about 800 units. Each building had an estimated capacity of 3,000 residents and an approximate space allocation at 30 ft² per person. Bathrooms and kitchens were combined into one compartment, as were living rooms and bedrooms. Lifts only reached some of the floors. To access the other floors, one needed to exit the lift at a level nearby and hike upstairs or downstairs. On the ground floor beneath the buildings were a variety of shops which served the residents. Although densely packed, the living environment of Lam Tin Estate fostered close relationships in the neighbourhood.\n\nOwing to the ageing of buildings, the reconstruction of Lam Tin Estate was announced in September 1995 as part of an urban renewal project. Demolition started in 1997 and was completed in 2002. After reconstruction, Lam Tin Estate became Kai Tin Estate, Tak Tin Estate, Ping Tin Estate and Hong Yat Court.\n\nLaguna City and Sceneway Garden were the earliest large-scale private-housing estates built in Lam Tin. Both were built by Cheung Kong Holdings and completed in the early 1990s.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Cheung Kong acquired two pieces of land in Lam Tin, one being a former Shell oil depot, the other above the newly built Lam Tin MTR Station and bus terminus, and developed them into Laguna City and Sceneway Garden respectively. Laguna City was completed in 1991 and Sceneway Garden was completed in 1992.\n\nSceneway Garden is built on the podium above Lam Tin Station. The podium was built in a valley between Cha Kwo Ling and Lam Tin Hill, which hosted a waste-car dump-site before its construction. It has a total of 17 towers and a gross floor area of 280,760 m². There are altogether 4112 flats housing approximately 20,000 people. It also has two carparks, one for residents and one for visitors. Built together with Sceneway Garden was Sceneway Plaza, which is a major shopping mall in southeastern Kowloon.\n\nLaguna City is built along Lam Tin's waterfront taking over the land from the former oil depot. Part of Laguna City is built on reclaimed land. Laguna City consists of four phases, totalling 38 towers upon its 1991 completion. Built together with Laguna City was Laguna Park, which was completed in 1994 and then handed over to Urban Council. Laguna Park has a total area of . Phases 1, 2 and 4 of Laguna City are managed by the same company, while phase 3 has an independent management authority. Similarly, phases 1, 2 and 4 share the same owners' committee, whereas phase 3 has its own.\n\nIn addition, Ko Chun Court and Ko Yee Estate in Yau Tong and Ma Yau Tong Village in Tiu Keng Leng are sometimes considered part of Lam Tin.\n\nBeing a compact residential area, Lam Tin has various facilities to satisfy its residents' daily needs. These include shopping malls, recreational facilities, water and other supplies. Furthermore, during the 1970s and 1980s, Lam Tin hosted landfills.\n\nTo meet the daily demands of its residents, Lam Tin hosts a number of shopping malls and markets. Most residential estates host individual shopping malls, and some of them have wet markets in addition to malls. These include:\n\nTo serve its residents, Lam Tin has a number of schools. They include kindergartens, primary schools and secondary schools. Some schools in Lam Tin are subsidised, others are private.\n\n\nLam Tin has a number of public parks, recreation grounds and indoor sports centres for its residents' use, including Lam Tin Park and Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground. It is also home to part of the Wilson Trail. There are also a few government indoor activity centres, including Lam Tin West Community Centre, Lam Tin South Indoor Sports Ground and Lam Tin Complex, as well as a number of private recreational facilities.\n\nLam Tin Park was built along Black Hill in 1991 to serve the needs of the fast-growing community. It consists mainly of hiking trails and walkways, with a 5-a-side football pitch and a children's playground. It also serves as an entrance to the Wilson Trail. The whole of Lam Tin and Victoria Harbour can be viewed from the lookout point at the peak of Lam Tin Park.\n\nSai Tso Wan Recreation Ground was built between 1995 and 2004 over the former Sai Tso Wan Landfill. During the construction, the former landfill underwent a series of restoration works. A final capping layer was added to prevent leakage; a landfill gas control system was used to deploy methane from the decomposed rubbish as fuel, and a leachate management system was built to collect leachate for further processing. The recreation ground started its operation on 30 April 2004.\n\nThe Lam Tin Complex on 1 Hing Ting Street was built between 2009 and 2013. The facilities of the complex includes two indoor swimming pools (25x25 and 25x10 metres respectively), the Kwun Tong Music Centre, a self-study room, rooftop gardens, and the new two-floor Lam Tin Public Library, which relocated from smaller premises in Tak Tin Estate.\n\nBesides recreation grounds, Lam Tin also hosts Stage 3 of Wilson Trail. The section starts at Exit A of Lam Tin MTR Station, runs east along Kai Tin Road and Lei Yue Mun Road, up Black Hill along the road towards Junk Bay Chinese Permanent Cemetery, west along the Black Hill, and finally leaves Lam Tin near Ma Yau Tong towards the section's terminus at Tseng Lan Shue.\n\nLam Tin has an underground network of safe water, town gas and domestic electricity supplies. Electricity in the area is served by China Light and Power. Town gas in the area is served by the Towngas Company.\n\nThe entire Lam Tin area is served by both tap water and flushing sea water supplies. The tap water is piped either from surface water or Dongjiang River into two service reservoirs and then pumped to individual households. The two service reservoirs that serve Lam Tin are Lam Tin Low Level Fresh Water Service Reservoir and Lam Tin High Level Service Reservoir. Built together with Lam Tin Estate, the low level reservoir is covered with a concrete-surfaced football field. The reservoir is now located between Kai Tin Estate and Tak Tin Estate. The high level reservoir, on the other hand, is farther away from residential estates. It is located near Lam Tin Park, on the slope of Black Hill.\n\nFrom 1978 to 1981, Sai Tso Wan Landfill (晒草灣堆填區) served East Kowloon. Approximately 1.6 million tonnes of domestic waste and commercial waste were dumped in the site during its four-year operation. The disposed waste stacked up to 65 metres high. After its closure in 1981, it was sealed with soil and planted over with Grasslands and trees. Sin Fat Road, which runs up the hill and hosts Sceneway Garden Minibus Terminus, was constructed. Sai Tso Wan Landfill was later rebuilt into Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground.\n\nAn area in Ma Yau Tong near today's Lam Tin Park was known as Ma Yau Tong Central Landfill (馬游塘中堆填區). The area measured 10.87 hectares, and operated until 1986 when it became the last urban landfill to be closed, after which it was sealed and converted to government-owned grassland.\n\nSince the total closure of urban landfills in 1986, rubbish from Lam Tin is first transferred to a treatment plant in Kowloon Bay where it is compressed, and then to South East New Territories Landfill (新界東南堆填區) where it is disposed of.\n\n"}
{"id": "2133824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2133824", "title": "Gustav Flatow", "text": "Gustav Flatow\n\nGustav Felix Flatow (7 January 1875 – 29 January 1945) was a German gymnast. He competed at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens and at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris.\n\nFlatow was Jewish, and was born in Berent, West Prussia. In 1892, he moved to Berlin.\n\nFlatow competed in the parallel bars, horizontal bar, vault, pommel horse, and rings individual events. He won no medals, unlike his cousin and teammate Alfred Flatow. However, both were members of the German team that competed in the two team events, for parallel bars and the horizontal bar. As Germany won both those events (the horizontal bar unchallenged), Gustav earned two gold medals. He also competed at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, but without winning medals. He retired from gymnastics to manage his textile company, which he founded in 1899.\nAfter the Nazi takeover in Germany in 1933, he had to flee to the Netherlands. On New Year's Eve 1943 he was jailed, and in February 1944 he was deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp, where his cousin had already died in 1942. Less than one year later he starved to death there at the age of 70. He lost up to 20 kg at the camp.\n\nWhen the Nazis took over in Germany in 1933 he fled the country. He did what so many people did which was trying to escape the Nazis terror. He went to the Netherlands to find refuge but he was caught ten years latter. On New Year's Eve 1943 he was jailed for fleeing and in February 1944 he was deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp. This camp was a combination of a concentration camp and ghetto. This camp was different that most of the concertation camps. This camp had two different objectives. One was for it to be a waystation to the extermination camps. The other objective was for it to be a \"retirement settlement\" for elderly and prominent Jews. This camp was used to try to mislead the German people about what was really happening. This was the same camp where his cousin who was in the Olympics was sent to. His cousin had already died there in 1942. Less than one year after he got there Gustav starved to death. He was 70 years old when he died on 29 January 1945, months before the Soviet army liberated the camp. \n\nIn 1986 journalists discovered his urn, which is now entombed in Terezín near the site of the concentration camp.\n\nIn 1997 Berlin honoured Alfred and Gustav Flatow by renaming the \"Reichssportfeldstraße\" (a lane) near the Olympic Stadium to Flatowallee (Flatow-avenue).

{"id": "2133829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2133829", "title": "Owen (musician)", "text": "Owen (musician)\n\nOwen is a solo project of Mike Kinsella, and part of the Chicago, Illinois indie rock scene.\n\nKinsella is one of the dominant and influential figures in the Chicago indie scene, having also led the band American Football, and played in the bands Cap'n Jazz, Joan of Arc, The One Up Downstairs and Owls, and most recently Their/ They're/There. \n\nOwen is known for its soft melodies, complex acoustics, combining lead acoustics with keyboard and other guitars, plaintive vocals and drums. It can be seen as a natural progression for Kinsella, from the progressive and experimental severity of Joan of Arc via the more melodic-progressive American Football.\n\nOwen's debut, \"Owen\" was a stark departure from previous Mike Kinsella projects. For 2002's \"No Good For No One Now\", Owen's second album, an arrangement of purchasing recording equipment instead of studio time was agreed upon. In 2004, in collaboration with Cale Parks (of Aloha), Bob Hoffnar, Jen Tabor, and Paul Koob, Mike began recording again. What resulted was \"(the ep)\". The joint effort marked a turning point of sorts for Owen. Rumors began to swirl that a live band would be taken on the road for the first time but these rumors never materialized as Mike again rejoined Joan of Arc and became a touring member of both Maritime and Aloha. \n\"(the ep)\" had been written as a companion piece to a scheduled full-length. In summer 2004, Mike again began recording and collaborating, this time with cousin Nate Kinsella (Make Believe, Joan of Arc) who lent assistance both on instrumentation and engineering. The results of these efforts were \"I Do Perceive\", Owen's third album.\n\nOn \"At Home With Owen\", Mike figuratively leaves the at-home bedroom that has characterized so much of Owen's past musical presence. His step away from bedroom recording allowed for an alternative approach to the songs recorded on At Home With Owen. \"I've always hated how two dimensional the other Owen albums have sounded, and I think this one's finally got a third dimension,\" Kinsella says. The new approach to recording involved a fraction of pre-recording at Mike's mom's house, followed by sessions at Semaphore Studios with cousin Nate Kinsella (Joan of Arc, Make Believe and finally at Engine Studios with Brian Deck (Iron & Wine, Red Red Meat).\n\nIn July 2009, Polyvinyl Records released \"The Seaside EP\", a collection of Owen songs previously only available as Japanese bonus tracks, as well as a track from the Association of Utopian Hologram Swallowers\".\n\nSince the release of his 2006 album, much has changed for Kinsella. During the writing process for the fifth album, \"New Leaves\", Kinsella became both a husband and a father, adding a sense of responsibility and new direction to the personalized quality of Owen releases. As the title would suggest, New Leaves finds Kinsella building upon and branching off of the core elements of his efforts - clever lyrics over intricate guitar work - now aided by a more complex song structure and refined lyrical matter. Produced by Brian Deck (Iron & Wine, Margot & the Nuclear So and So's), Graeme Gibson (Califone, Joan of Arc), Tim Iseler (Wilco, Teenage Fanclub) and cousin Nate Kinsella, New Leaves is 10 tracks of renewal and personal growth.\n\nIn 2010, Owen released the \"Abandoned Bridges\" single. He has also released an EP titled \"O, Evelyn\" in April 2011. Owen's album, \"Ghost Town\", was released on November 8, 2011. Owen's album, \"L'Ami du Peuple\", was released on July 2, 2013.\n\nOn October 2, 2014, it was announced that Owen is releasing a covers album titled \"Other People's Songs\". The album was released on December 2, 2014, through Polyvinyl Records. It included covers of songs from artists including Against Me!, Depeche Mode, The Promise Ring, and Lungfish amongst others.\n\nIn July 2016 he released the album \"The King of Whys\" through Polyvinyl in America and Wichita Recordings in England.\n\n\n"}

Part of the street is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Sixteenth Street Historic District.\n\nPart of Pierre L'Enfant's design for the city, 16th Street begins just north of the White House across Lafayette Park at H Street and continues due north in a straight line passing K Street, Scott Circle, Meridian Hill Park, Rock Creek Park, and the Walter Reed Army Medical Center before crossing Eastern Avenue into Silver Spring, Maryland, where it ends at Georgia Avenue. From K Street to the District line, 16th Street is part of the National Highway System. The Maryland portion of the street is designated Maryland State Highway 390. The entire street is long.\n\nThe Washington meridian, a prime meridian once in use in the United States, follows the street.\n\nEarly in the city's history, many foreign countries opened their embassies on 16th Street because of its proximity to the White House. Many religious denominations followed with churches, earning the street the nickname \"Church Row.\" These include Foundry Methodist (attended by Presidents Hayes and Clinton), First Baptist (attended by Presidents Truman and Carter), the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church which was originally named the First Colored Baptist Church of Washington, D.C. (visited twice by President Barack Obama), St. John's (\"Church of the Presidents\"), All Souls Unitarian, Universalist National Memorial Church, St. John the Baptist Russian Orthodox Cathedral, founded in 1949 and built in 1958, and Third Church of Christ, Scientist, which was designed by an associate of I.M. Pei in 1972. Shrine of the Sacred Heart is located just off of 16th Street. After most of the embassies moved to Embassy Row and other parts of the city, the churches became more prominent in 16th Street's identity.\n\nOther notable buildings include the Scottish Rite Masons' House of the Temple, Carnegie Institution for Science, Robert Simpson Woodward House, the Warder Mansion, Carter Barron Amphitheater, the Washington, D.C. Jewish Community Center, and the Toutorsky Mansion.\n\nThe AFL-CIO, American Trucking Association, National Education Association, American Chemical Society, National Geographic Society, and Benjamin Franklin University have prominent buildings on 16th Street. The National Rifle Association was until the late 1990s headquartered on the street.\n\nThe northern and central portions of 16th Street — and the Crestwood neighborhood, in particular — have for a half century been the chosen neighborhood of accomplished African Americans in Washington. Known colloquially as \"The Gold Coast\", these sections of 16th Street are lined with early 20th-century Tudor mansions. As 16th Street continues north through the Shepherd Park neighborhood, the street passes Tudor-style house at 7700 16th Street NW, the scene of a notorious crime, and several houses of worship including the Ohev Sholom synagogue.\n\nThe street's proximity to Rock Creek Park and importance as a thoroughfare has made it a natural dividing boundary for Washington neighborhoods. Outside of the downtown area, no neighborhood in the city falls on both sides of 16th Street; the neighborhoods that surround it have 16th as either their eastern or their western boundary. For many years, the wide street was the de facto \"boundary\" between Caucasian and African-American neighborhoods of the city, especially in the tense years after the 1968 race riots.\n\nA pair of similarly named streets, 16th Street Northeast and 16th Street Southeast, are three miles (5 km) away in the northeast and southeast quadrants of Washington. They are contiguous with each other and parallel to 16th Street NW. There is no 16th Street Southwest, as this space is occupied by → [the National Mall, and the Washington Channel.]←\n\n→ [NOTE:Lafayette Square and the White House sit immediately north of the Mall.

North from the Capitol building, separations are the Mall on the west, and North Capitol Street north of the Capitol] DC city map ←\n\nIn 1920, more than 500 trees were planted along 16th Street between Alaska Avenue and Varnum Street to honor fallen soldiers from World War I. Today, the 16th Street World War I Memorial Trees and their corresponding markers have largely been lost to history.\n\nIn July 2005, just before Congress's summer recess, Texas Republican congressman Henry Bonilla quietly introduced resolution H.R. 3525 to rename 16th Street NW \"Ronald Reagan Boulevard\" in honor of the former president of the United States. Mayor Anthony A. Williams objected on the grounds that the proposal changes Pierre L'Enfant's 1791 design for the city and would have cost an estimated $1 million for new signs and maps. The plan was ultimately quashed by Rep. Tom Davis, chairman of the House Government Reform Committee and a fellow Republican representing Washington's Virginia suburbs.\n"}

He attended four high schools in North Carolina, Maryland and Massachusetts before playing collegiately at Georgia Tech. He was selected with the 22nd overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets, before playing with the Portland Trail Blazers, Indiana Pacers, Toronto Raptors, New Orleans Hornets, Golden State Warriors, Cleveland Cavaliers, Brooklyn Nets, New Orleans Pelicans and New York Knicks.\n\nJack attended four high schools, including DeMatha Catholic High School and St. Vincent Pallotti High School in Maryland, Mount Zion Academy in North Carolina, and Worcester Academy in Massachusetts.\n\nConsidered a four-star recruit by Scout.com, Jack was listed as the No. 9 point guard and the No. 40 player in the nation in 2002.\n\nAfter high school, Jack played for Georgia Tech in Atlanta. In his sophomore year (2003–04), he helped guide Georgia Tech to the NCAA Finals with 12.5 points and 5.1 assists a game. In his junior and final year at Georgia Tech he averaged 15.5 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4.5 assists.\n\nAfter forgoing his senior year of eligibility at Georgia Tech to enter the NBA draft, Jack graduated on December 13, 2014, receiving his degree in business management at commencement ceremonies in Atlanta.\n\nAfter his junior year at Georgia Tech, he opted to enter the 2005 NBA draft and was selected by the Denver Nuggets with the 22nd pick. On draft night, he was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for their 27th pick (Linas Kleiza) and 35th pick (Ricky Sánchez).\n\nAs a rookie in 2005–06, Jack backed up Steve Blake and Sebastian Telfair as a point guard, getting limited minutes. Blake was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks and Telfair was traded to the Boston Celtics in a multi-player trade during the 2006 off-season. In their absence, Jack was named starting point guard by coach Nate McMillan for the 2006–07 season, dramatically increasing his minutes and stats. With Blake's return in 2007–08, however, Jack was once again relegated to sixth man.\n\nOn July 9, 2008, Jack was traded to the Indiana Pacers along with Josh McRoberts and 2008 NBA draft pick Brandon Rush for Ike Diogu and Jerryd Bayless.\n\nOn July 13, 2009, Jack signed a 4-year, $20 million offer sheet with the Toronto Raptors.

On April 15, 2014, he was named the recipient of the ninth annual Austin Carr Good Guy Award. The award, named after Cavaliers legend Austin Carr, is designed to recognize a Cavaliers player who is cooperative and understanding of the media.\n\nOn July 10, 2014, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Jack to the Brooklyn Nets in a three-team trade also involving the Boston Celtics, as they needed to clear cap space to sign LeBron James. This is the second trade involving Jack where the team trading him away received the rights to Edin Bavcic in return. Hours after graduating from Georgia Tech on December 13, 2014, Jack travelled to Charlotte to join his teammates for their game against the Hornets. In 20 minutes of action off the bench, he recorded 14 points, 5 assists and 2 rebounds to help the Nets win 114–87.\n\nOn November 14, 2015, Jack scored a season-high 28 points in an overtime loss to the Golden State Warriors. On January 3, 2016, he was ruled out for the rest of the season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament and small medial meniscus tear in his right knee. He sustained the injury the previous night during the second half of the Nets' game at Boston. On June 30, 2016, Jack was waived by the Nets.\n\nOn July 15, 2016, Jack signed with the Atlanta Hawks. However, on October 20, 2016, he was waived by the Hawks due to injury.

On November 24, 2017, he had 10 points and a season-high 14 assists against the Atlanta Hawks. On December 10, 2017, also against the Hawks, Jack scored a season-high 19 points. On January 10, 2018, he recorded his first triple-double in six years with 16 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a 122–119 double overtime loss to the Chicago Bulls. Four days later, he set a new season high with 22 points in a 123–118 overtime loss to the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nJack signed with the Pelicans on September 19, 2018, before being waived on October 13.\n\nOn March 5, 2019, Jack was acquired by the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the NBA G League.

{"id": "2133843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2133843", "title": "Constitutional autochthony", "text": "Constitutional autochthony\n\nIn political science, constitutional autochthony is the process of asserting constitutional nationalism from an external legal or political power. The source of autochthony is the Greek word αὐτόχθων translated as \"springing from the land\". It usually means the assertion of not just the concept of autonomy, but also the concept that the constitution derives from their own native traditions. The autochthony, or home grown nature of constitutions, give them authenticity and effectiveness. It was important in the making and revising of the constitutions of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Ghana, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Zambia and many other members of the British Commonwealth.\n\nThis proposition found doctrinal support in the influential theory propounded by the legal philosopher, Hans Kelsen, which had it that it was inconceivable for a legal system to split into two independent legal systems through a purely legal process. One of the implications of Kelsen’s theory was that the basic norm (\"grundnorm\") of the imperial predecessor’s Constitution would continue to be at the helm of the legal system of the newly liberated former colony despite the legal transfer of power, precisely because the transfer of power was recognised as ‘legal’ by the Constitution of the imperial predecessor.\n\nA process of constitutional autochthony occurred in the Irish Free State between 1932 and 1937. The Fianna Fáil government elected in 1932 led by Éamon de Valera, who had opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1922 that had created the state, stripped the Irish Free State of many of the state symbols that it saw as being overtly reminiscent of British rule. Among the amendments made to the Constitution were the abolition of the Oath of Allegiance (by the \"Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act 1933\"), appeals to the United Kingdom's Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (by the \"Constitution (Amendment No. 22) Act 1933\"), and the office of the Governor-General (by the \"Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936\"). The abdication of Edward VIII in December 1936 was used to significantly redefine the royal connection.\n\nIn 1937, the Irish Government introduced a whole new constitution that replaced the 1922 Constitution, which as originally enacted had been agreed with the British Government following the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty. This changed the legal name of the country to Ireland (in English) and Éire (in Irish). It was possibly a break of legal continuity, since the new constitution was not enacted by the Dail but merely approved by it pending a plebiscite through statute, but was instead given legitimacy by the people of Ireland through a plebiscite.\n\nThe process de Valera engaged in from 1932 to 1937 has been described by Professor John M. Kelly and others as 'constitutional autochthony'.\n\nIndependence was formally granted to India by the enactment of the Indian Independence Act 1947 though the executive decision to grant India independence was arrived at earlier in the Cabinet Mission Plan in 1946. It was under this Plan that the Constituent Assembly was envisaged and charged with the mandate of drafting the new Constitution for India. This was legally recognised in Section 8 of the Independence Act. The Cabinet Mission Plan had envisaged that the new Constitution would be put to the Crown-in-Parliament for approval.\n\nThe framers introduced two deliberate procedural errors in the enactment of the Constitution of India in violation of the Independence Act: \nIn doing so, the framers not only repudiated the source which authorised them to enact the Constitution but it was also a denial, albeit symbolic, of Indian independence being a grant of the imperial Crown-in-Parliament.\n\n"}
{"id": "2133844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2133844", "title": "Kings Mountain National Military Park", "text": "Kings Mountain National Military Park\n\nKings Mountain National Military Park is a National Military Park near Blacksburg, South Carolina, along the North Carolina/South Carolina border. The park commemorates the Battle of Kings Mountain, a pivotal and significant victory by American Patriots over American Loyalists during the Southern Campaign of the Revolutionary War. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Thomas Jefferson considered the battle \"The turn of the tide of success.\"\n\nThe Battle of Kings Mountain was fought on October 7, 1780, and destroyed the left wing of Lord Cornwallis' army, effectively ending Loyalist ascendance in the Carolinas. The victory halted the British advance into North Carolina, forced Lord Cornwallis to retreat from Charlotte into South Carolina, and gave General Nathanael Greene the opportunity to reorganize the American Army. \n\nPrior to 1780, much of the Revolutionary War was fought in the Northern states. After an unsuccessful Northern campaign, British General Clinton decided to turn his attention to the south, where he believed that he and his troops would join up with loyalist militias and easily take the area. The campaign began with a swift move to capture Charleston, which was taken over after two months of fighting. After the capture of Charleston, Clinton wanted to capitalize on his victory, and sent British detachments in all directions, to subdue as much resistance as possible. After placing Cornwallis in charge of the Southern Campaign, Clinton returned to New York, where much of the British high command was. Clinton's instructions were to first finish off South Carolina, and then move north, to North Carolina, followed by Virginia.\n\nAfter the defeat at Charleston, Colonel Abraham Buford, whose force of 400 Virginians had been too late to help defend Charleston, decided to take his troops and head back to Virginia. In late May, his troops were intercepted by Colonel Tarleton's troops. When the two forces met, the Battle of Waxhaws ensued. Realizing his force could not win, Buford sent forward a messenger to surrender, however, Buford's requests were ignored. Tarleton wanted to make an example of Buford's troops, and killed 113 of his men, and wounded around 50 so badly that they could not be moved. Another 50 were taken prisoner, and the remaining 200 managed to escape. The Battle of Waxhaws helped inspire armed resistance in much of the south, especially in the Carolinas.\n\nThe situation in the southern states was getting desperate. Many people considered giving up Georgia and the Carolinas without a fight. There were few organized forces left in the south. Theodore Roosevelt's quote, from his book \"Winning of the West\", sums up the situation quite well: \"Except for occasional small guerrilla parties, there was not a single organized body of American troops left south of Gates...\". Despite the derelict feelings of many southerners, enough patriotism was stirred to gather a small contingent of men to defend the Kings Mountain area. Despite reported ankle-deep snow during their march, the men continued to train and march on. After stopping for a lunch break at the Roan Highlands, it was discovered that two men with tory leanings were missing. Deciding that the British may be closer than originally thought, the commanding officers decided to change their route. The men traveled on a couple more days, until stopping at Gillespie's Gap to divide their troops in case of a British ambush. After dividing their troops, the now-separated forces marched on, until they met again on September 30. Later, men from Wilkes County and Surry County, North Carolina joined the so-called Overmountain Men on their march towards the British, bringing their total force to about 1,400. The army resumed marching on October 1, however, they stopped due to heavy rains, which continued on in to the next day. After roughly an hour of combat the Patriot forces defeated the British, and took nearly 700 prisoners.\n\nKings Mountain National Military Park was established on March 3, 1931 by an act of Congress: \"in order to commemorate the Battle of Kings Mountain.\" The park is the terminus of the Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail commemorating the route of the Patriot army from over the Appalachian Mountains to the battle.\n\nThe park adjoins Kings Mountain State Park, which offers camping, picnicking and a \"living history\" farm. It is approximately 30 miles south of Charlotte, North Carolina and approximately 60 miles North of Greenville, South Carolina. Kings Mountain can be seen from I-85 North for many miles.\n\nA one and a half mile paved trail leads from the visitors' center around the base of the mountain along the Patriot lines and ascends to the crest where the Loyalists were positioned. The trail passes several monuments, large and small, the earliest dating from 1815, as well as Patrick Ferguson's grave, giving a good sense of the battleground. The trail is moderately steep in places. As part of the NPS' Centennial Initiative, the trail will be rehabilitated to eliminate the steeper sections of the trail, making it accessible to everyone.\n\nOn the sesquicentennial of the battle, then-president Herbert Hoover gave a speech commemorating the battle and the monument as \"a place of inspiring memories.\" In the speech, he chronicled the basic history of America, detailing many great things about America, such as the rise of the American man and women. The whole speech can be read here. A year after Hoover gave his speech, a monument was erected by the Daughters of the American Revolution, which simply states \"ON THIS SITE / PRESIDENT HOOVER / ADDRESSED AN AUDIENCE OF 75,000 / AT THE CELEBRATION OF THE / SESQUI CENTENNIAL / OF THE BATTLE OF KINGS MOUNTAIN,\" finishing with the date of the address. The monument, placed roughly where Hoover was standing, is a stop along the historic loop trail.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2133845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2133845", "title": "Mastering the Art of French Cooking", "text": "Mastering the Art of French Cooking\n\nMastering the Art of French Cooking is a two-volume French cookbook written by Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle, both of France, and Julia Child of the United States. The book was written for the American market and published by Knopf in 1961 (Volume 1) and 1970 (Volume 2). The success of Volume 1 resulted in Julia Child being given her own television show, \"The French Chef\", one of the first cooking programs on American television. Historian David Strauss claimed in 2011 that the publication of \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" \"did more than any other event in the last half century to reshape the gourmet dining scene.\"\n\nAfter World War II, interest in French cuisine rose significantly in the United States. Through the late 1940s and 1950s, Americans interested in preparing French dishes had few options. \"Gourmet\" magazine offered French recipes to subscribers monthly, and several dozen French cookbooks were published throughout the 1950s. These recipes, however, were directly translated from French, and consequently were designed for a middle-class French audience that was familiar with French cooking techniques, had access to common French ingredients, and who often had servants cook for them.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle, French cooking teachers who had trained at Le Cordon Bleu, sought to capitalize on the American market for French cookbooks and wrote and published a small recipe book for American audiences, \"What's Cooking in France\", in 1952\".\" By the late 1950s, Beck and Bertholle were interested in writing a comprehensive guide to French cuisine that would appeal to serious middle-class American home cooks. Beck and Bertholle wanted an English-speaking partner to help give them insight into American culture, translate their work into English, and bring it to American publishers, so they invited their friend Julia Child, who had also studied at Le Cordon Bleu, to collaborate with them on a book tentatively titled \"French Cooking for the American Kitchen\". The resulting cookbook, \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\", proved groundbreaking and has since become a standard guide for the culinary community.\n\nBeck, Bertholle, and Child wanted to distinguish their book from others on the market by emphasizing accurate instructions and measurements in their recipes, and authenticity whenever possible. After prototyping dishes in their Paris cooking school, L'École des trois gourmandes, Child would check to make sure the ingredients were available in the average American grocery store; if they were not, she would suggest a substitution and they would begin the prototyping process again with the substituted ingredient, sometimes flying in ingredients from America to perform their tests. While Beck, Bertholle, and Child wanted all of the recipes to be as authentic as possible, they were willing to adapt to American palates and cooking techniques. Child had noted early in the process that Americans would be \"scared off\" by too many expensive ingredients, like black truffles, and would expect broccoli, not particularly popular in France, to be served with many meals, and adjustments were made to accommodate these tastes. American home cooks at the time were also more inclined to use appliances like garlic presses and mixers than French cooks, and so Child insisted that supplemental instructions for cooks using these appliances be included in the book alongside the normal instructions.\n\n\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" Volume 1 was originally published in 1961 after some early difficulties. Beck, Bertholle, and Child initially signed a contract with publisher Houghton Mifflin, but Houghton Mifflin grew uninterested in the project. Child recalled one editor telling her, \"Americans don't want an encyclopedia, they want to cook something quick, with a mix.\" Beck, Bertholle, and Child refused to make requested changes to the manuscript, and Houghton Mifflin abandoned the project, writing that the book, as it stood, would be \"too formidable to the American housewife.\" Judith Jones of Alfred A. Knopf became interested in the manuscript after it had been rejected. After spending several years in Paris, Jones had moved to New York, where she grew frustrated with the limited ingredients and recipes commonly available in the United States. Jones felt that the manuscript would offer a lifeline to middle-class women, like her, who were interested in learning how to cook French cuisine in America, and predicted that \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\", \"will do for French cooking here in America what Rombauer's \"The Joy of Cooking\" did for standard [American] cooking.\" While Jones was enthusiastic about the book, Knopf had low expectations and invested very little into promoting it. In order to generate interest in the book, and without support from Knopf, Child appeared on several morning talk shows in 1961 to demonstrate recipes, which she later cited as the impetus for her own cooking show, The French Chef.\n\nVolume 1 was immensely successful, and work on Volume 2 began around 1964, as a collaboration between Simone Beck and Julia Child, but not Louisette Bertholle. By the end of 1960, Beck and Child had grown frustrated with Bertholle because they felt she did not contribute enough to \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" to merit co-authorship and one third of the book's proceeds, and wanted Knopf to change the byline to read \"by Simone Beck and Julia Child with Louisette Bertholle.\" Beck argued, \"it is bad for the book for her to present herself as Author, as she really does not cook well enough, or know enough,\" and that Bertholle should only be entitled to 10% of the profits (to Beck and Child's 45% each). Ultimately, the contract with the publisher necessitated that Bertholle be given a co-author credit, and the final profit split was 18% to Bertholle and 41% each to Beck and Child. The dispute left Bertholle extremely upset, and effectively severed the professional partnership between herself and Beck and Child.\n\nVolume 2 expanded on certain topics of interest that had not been covered as completely as the three had planned in the first volume, particularly baking. In an otherwise laudatory review of Volume 1, Craig Claiborne wrote that Beck, Bertholle, and Child had conspicuously omitted recipes for puff pastry and croissants, making their work feel incomplete. Bread became one of the primary focuses of Volume 2, and the main source of tension between Beck and Child and their publisher, Knopf. Knopf feared that the bread recipes that Beck and Child were testing would be stolen by a competing publisher, and insisted Beck and Child cease their semi-public testing of the recipes to reduce risk, which Beck and Child agreed to reluctantly.\n\nChild became increasingly frustrated with the project as work on Volume 2 went on. Not only was she agitated by the demands of the publisher, she was growing tired of working with Beck, who she felt was too demanding. Child was also angry that, while \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" had been a runaway success in the United States, there was virtually no demand for the book in France itself, leading her to exclaim, \"French women don't know a damn thing about French cooking, although they pretend they know everything.\" Her experience writing Volume 2, along with her continued success on television, led Child to sever her partnership with Beck and preclude the possibility of a Volume 3, even though Beck, Bertholle, and Child had always intended the work to span five volumes.\n\nVolume 1 covers the basics of French cooking, striking as much of a balance between the complexities of haute cuisine and the practicalities of the American home cook. Traditional favorites such as beef bourguignon, bouillabaisse, and cassoulet are featured. This volume has been through many printings and has been reissued twice with revisions: first in 1983 with updates for changes in kitchen practice (especially the food processor), and then in 2003 as a 40th anniversary edition with the history of the book in the introduction. The cookbook includes 524 recipes.\n\nSome classic French baking is also included, but baking received a more thorough treatment in Volume 2, published in 1970.\n\nVolume 1 of \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" received overwhelmingly positive reviews when it was first released in 1961. In the \"New York Times\", Craig Claiborne wrote that the recipes in the book \"are glorious, whether they are for a simple egg in aspic or for a fish souffle,\" and that it \"is not a book for those with a superficial interest in food...but for those who take a fundamental delight in the pleasures of cuisine.\" Michael Field, writing for the \"New York Review of Books\", praised Beck, Bertholle, and Child for \"not limiting themselves to \"la haute cuisine,\"\" and stated that \"for once, the architectural structure of the French cuisine is firmly and precisely outlined in American terms.\" Field's sole criticism of the book was that the authors suggested dry vermouth as a substitute for white wine, as he felt the domestic vermouth available to American home cooks, the book's target audience, was \"bland and characterless.\" Despite being a relatively expensive cookbook, retailing for $10 in 1965, \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" Volume 1 did well commercially, selling over 100,000 copies in less than five years. According to Julia Child biographer Noel Riley Fitch, the publication of \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" instantaneously changed the entire American cookbook industry, leading more cookbook publishers to place emphasis on clarity and precision, and away from the \"chatty and sometimes sketchy\" style that had typified American cookbooks.\n\nOn its release in 1970, Volume 2 was also well-received. Critics praised the book's comprehensiveness, but some felt that it was far too ambitious for the average home cook. Gael Greene, reviewing the book for \"Life\", wrote that Volume 2 was \"a classic continued,\" and made the contents of Volume 1 look like \"mud-pie stuff,\" while Raymond Sokolov wrote that \"it is without rival, the finest gourmet cookbook for the non-chef in the history of American stomachs.\" The \"New York Times\"' review was mixed, with critic Nika Hazelton praising the book for being \"elegant and accurate,\" but criticized it for being too interested in minutia and theory to be useful for the home cook. Learning French cooking from \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\", she wrote, would be akin to \"learning to drive a car by having the workings of the internal combustion engine described in full detail.\" Similarly, Nancy Ross of the \"Washington Post Times Herald\" argued that many of the recipes in Volume 2 would be far too time consuming, difficult, and expensive for the American home cook, pointing out that the recipe for French bread provided in the book was nineteen pages long, took seven hours to complete, and required the use of \"a brick and a sheet of asbestos cement.\"\n\nThe 2009 film, \"Julie & Julia\", based on Child's memoir \"My Life in France\" and Julie Powell's memoir \"Julie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously\". The success of this film, combined with a tied-in reissue of the 40th Anniversary edition, caused it to once again become a bestseller in the United States, 48 years after its initial release.\n\nCritical perception of \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" has generally remained positive. In 2015, \"The Daily Telegraph\" ranked it as the second greatest cookbook of all time, behind Fergus Henderson's \"Nose to Tail Eating\". In a 2012 \"New York Times\" piece commemorating Julia Child's 100th birthday, Julia Moskin wrote that \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" should be credited with \"turning the tide\" on American food culture 1961, when \"trends including feminism, food technology and fast food seemed ready to wipe out home cooking.\" Moskin added that, \"in its fundamental qualities, the book and its many successors in the Child canon aren't dated at all. Their recipes remain perfectly written and rock-solid reliable.\" By contrast, in 2009, food writer Regina Schrambling published a piece in Slate entitled, \"Don't Buy Julia Child's \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\",\" where she argued that the book now \"seems overwhelming in a Rachael Ray world,\" its recipes overly complicated and unsuited for modern American tastes.\n\n\n"}

Heathcote's local government area is the City of Greater Bendigo and it is part of the federal electorate of Bendigo and the state electorate of Euroa. At the , Heathcote had a population of 2,793.\n\nThe first European known to have visited the district was Major Thomas Mitchell in 1836. By 1851 about 400 Europeans lived on some 16 pastoral properties in the area.\n\nLate in 1852 gold was discovered at McIvor Creek. Within six months some 40,000 miners were camped in the vicinity. It proved to be one of the richest finds during the Australian gold rushes, but the gold was so easily found that it was soon largely exhausted and by the end of the year a large proportion of the miners had already left for other recent finds (although deeper deposits continued to be mined for many years). This was not before the Victorian government gazetted the township of Heathcote on the site and ordered the construction of several official buildings. The post office opened on 1 July 1853 as McIvor Creek but six months later, on 1 January 1854, was renamed Heathcote.\n\nWith the decline of gold mining the region took on an increased importance as a pastoral district.\n\nHeathcote was served by railway from 1889 to 1968.\n\nThe Heathcote Magistrates' Court closed on 1 January 1990.\n\nThe most famous incident during the gold rush era was the Melbourne Private Escort Robbery on 20 July 1853. This took place very close to where one of Australia's worst aviation disasters occurred in 1945.\n\nHeathcote is the closest major town to the Heathcote-Graytown National Park and Lake Eppalock.\n\nThe town hosts an agricultural show on Melbourne Cup day, each November.\n\nFood & Wine\n\nA weekend early in October is dedicated to the Heathcote Wine and Food Festival held at the show grounds. This is a dynamic event that has grown rapidly since its inception in 1994.\n\nThe town has several sporting teams;\n\nBasketball: One of the most celebrated sports teams in Heathcote, the Heathcote Panthers Basketball Club with both junior and senior teams ranging from the under 10's and under 12's in both boys and girls under 14's and under 16's boys and also both an adult mens and ladies team.\n\nAustralian Rules: The town has an Australian Rules football team playing in the Heathcote District Football League.\n\nHeathcote managed to capture back to back premierships in 2009/10. Heathcote continued to thrive over the next two seasons playing off in the Grand Final until a mass exodus of players.\n\nDespite the reluctance of many to play alongside such a divisive character, the Saints maintained their century-long streak of at least one win per season.\n\nCricket: The Heathcote Cricket Club competes in the Northern United Cricket Association and celebrated back to back premiership success in seasons 2012/13 & 2013/14, due to local Superstar and the regions playboy Dion Meerman. Whilst the departure of Meerman in the off season left the Heathcote cricket community reeling, the saints, under the captaincy of Fish Conforti were unable to deliver a 3 peat and subsequently has been the only skipper not to deliver a premiership since admission into the NUCA. In 2016/17 under the tutelage of 2 time premiership player Corey Gilmore, the saints began to reaffirm themselves as a force of the NUCA competition. Ultimately the Saints finished 3rd that year and was seen as a lost opportunity. The following year the saints recruited heavily especially with the marquee signing of Shane Cox, who signed on for a box of socos and hit the winning runs in the 2018 grand final win. 2019/2020 saw a disappointing end to the cricket season with Corey Gilmore and Patrick Ring failing with the bat at a crucial point in the game to gift the Colbo ducks the win in the semi finial. On a positive note Ben Connelly the club's 5th best leg spinner registered his first wicket with the club in 5 seasons.\n\nGolf: Golfers play at the Heathcote Golf Course, a quality 18 hole championship course.\n\nMotor Racing/Athletics & Horse Racing: Heathcote has a harness track (2040m) that also acts as a speedway.\n\n"}

He graduated the Naval Academy in 1863 and served on the screw sloop during the Civil War for the Battle of Mobile Bay. Clark was officially made a captain in 1896, most remarkably for his command of the battleship . After his impressive commandment of his ship at Cervera’s squadron, and was appointed Rear Admiral in 1902. Clark died of heart failure in Long Beach on October 1, 1922, at age 79.\n\nCharles Edgar Clark was born in Bradford, Vermont on August 10, 1843, to James Dayton Clark and Mary Sexton Clark. His earlier education was largely composed of his attendance to Bradford Academy. From a young age, Clark was an avid reader and especially fond of military history. He was inspired by historical military figures such as Hannibal, Napoleon, Marlborough, and many more generals, and expressed interest in attending military school around age sixteen. His father (James Dayton Clark) was acquaintanced with the Honorable Justin S. Morrill, and wrote to him asking for an appointment for Charles to the Military Academy. While he was denied at West Point on account of there being no vacancies, Morrill offered Clark a spot at the Naval Academy, which he accepted.\n\nClark travelled to the Naval Academy in Annapolis and arrived there on September 29, 1860. He first reported to the superintendent of the Naval Academy, Captain George S. Blake, and began working on the ship \"Constitution\", or “Old Ironsides”, with C. R. P. Rodgers, Edward Simpson, Stephen B. Luce, and Lieutenants Flusser, John Taylor Wood, Hunter Davidson, and William H. Parker.\n\nRumors of war influenced a rising unrest at the Academy, and students’ desire to leave school to be part of a fight was stronger than ever. Clark’s first practice cruise was during the summer of 1862. It took place in the under the supervision of Commander Edward Simpson. During this trip, their crew ventured up the Peninsula near the Fortress Monroe, and then to Yorktown, Long Island, and New Haven. His second practice cruise was a summer later, in 1863. The crew served under Commander Steven B. Luce on the corvette \"Macedonian\". This trip ventured across the North Atlantic to New England, Plymouth, and Spithead. It was there that Clark and the other students visited the Arsenal at Woolwich, where they saw weapons like triphammers. They spent time in France and New York, where they were towed into Long Island Sound by the steamer \"Freeborn\" shortly before she sank. Clark and the crew of the \"Macedonian\" rescued the other sailors and continued on their way.\n\nClark graduated from the Naval Academy in 1863. He commanded the Bermuda for the passage to the Philadelphia Navy yard, where he then reported to the screw sloop . He stayed on the \"Ossipee\" (which was under the command of John P. Gillis) for the Battle of Mobile Bay and in the bombardment of Fort Morgan, which was all his Civil War service. Clark was promoted to captain in 1896.\n\nIn March 1898, he took command of the battleship at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, San Francisco. When war with Spain was deemed inevitable, he received orders to proceed to Key West, Florida, with all haste. The \"Oregon\", her crew, and Clark sailed from San Francisco on March 19. After a most remarkable voyage of over 14,000 miles, around Cape Horn, he joined the American fleet in Cuban waters on May 26. On May 27, his crew was increased by sixty sailors. With a team of other ships; \"Brooklyn\", \"Massachusetts\", \"Iowa\", \"Texas\", \"Marblehead\", and \"New Orleans\", they set up a blockade intended to last until July. On July 3, the USS \"Oregon\", captained by Clark, led the chase resulting in the destruction of Cervera's squadron. For this high accomplishment, he was advanced in seniority, and was appointed Rear Admiral 16 June 1902.\n\nAdmiral Clark was a Veteran Companion of the Vermont Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.\n\nHe died of heart failure at his home in Long Beach, California on October 1, 1922.\n\nThe destroyer was named for him.\n\nThere is a statue of Admiral Clark in his hometown of Bradford, Vermont.\n\n\n"}

Following this, the Group deployed all of its available aircraft aboard 7th Fleet ships and in the famous [[Operation Frequent Wind]], on 29 April 1975 in a 24-hour period, evacuated over 7000 people from [[Saigon]] aboard MAG-36 helicopters.\n\nFrom the late 1970s through the 1980s, MAG-36 continued to support fleet operations in the Pacific Theater. MAG-36 became the Unit Deployment Program (UDP) linchpin in the Western Pacific (WestPac). As part of the UDP, CH-46, CH-53, and OV-10 squadrons from North Carolina and California deployed to MCAS Futenma for six-month rotations. During these deployments MAG-36 participated in numerous exercises and training deployments to various countries around the WestPac.\n\nIn November 1992, the last UDP detachment of OV-10s returned to Camp Pendleton, CA. In the spring of 1993, HMM-262 arrived from Hawaii to become a permanent part of MAG-36. HMM-262 was followed by HMM-265, and these two CH-46 squadrons have formed the backbone of the 31st MEU Aviation Combat Element.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, MAG-36 units participated in a variety of contingency operations. In 1995, MAG-36 units conducted relief operations in Kobe Japan after 6,400 people lost their lives in an earthquake and also participated in the withdrawal of United Nation Forces from Somalia during Operation UNITED SHIELD. In 1999, units responded to a no-notice deployment to the Persian Gulf for Operation DESERT FOX and to East Timor for peacekeeping during Operation STABILIZE.\n\nDuring the first decade of the 21st century, MAG-36 units continued to support Theater Security Cooperation exercises and numerous contingency operations. In 2004 and 2007 respectively, HMM-265 and HMM-262 deployed for Operation IRAQI FREEDOM combat operations. Since May 2009, VMGR-152 has been providing an enduring two-plane detachment to Afghanistan for Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. In 2014, VMGR-152 detached from MAG-36, moving to Iwakuni, Japan and now falls under MAG-12.\n\nNearly every year, MAG-36 deploys as a MEB-level Aviation Combat Element, often supporting Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations. In November 2007, in the wake of Tropical Cyclone Sidr MAG-36 elements deployed to Bangladesh for Operation SEA ANGEL II. MAG-36 supported Operation CARING RESPONSE in May 2008 from Thailand after Tropical Cyclone Nargis impacted Burma. Additionally, MAG-36 has conducted HADR in the Philippines on three separate occasions: during 2004 with Joint Task Force 535, following three back-to-back typhoons in October 2009, and again in October 2010 in the wake of Super Typhoon MEGI. Most recently during Operation TOMODACHI, MAG-36 deployed to mainland Japan immediately following the triple-disaster created by an earthquake, tsunami, and damaged nuclear reactor to provide much needed relief to our host nation.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:United States Marine Corps aircraft groups]]"}

Many of the leading figures of the Soviet–Afghan War were members of this group, including Professor Mawlavi Habibur Rahman, Engineer Habibur Rahman, Saifuddin Nasratyar, and Engineer Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.\n\nThe Muslim Youth Organization was founded in 1969 in Kabul, at a critical point in Afghanistan's history, with proponents of communism and Qutb-inspired Islamism vying fiercely to gain supremacy in determining the direction of the state and society. Kabul University was a center of this conflict, with both Marxists and Islamists on the faculty and corresponding student organizations dedicated to the respective ideologies. One professor of the Shar`ia faculty (the department for the study of Islamic law), the future mujahidin leader Burhanuddin Rabbani, had recently translated Sayyid Qutb's \"Milestones\" (Ma`alim fi'l-tariq) into Dari and was teaching this text at the University.\n\nIt was in this context that the Muslim Youth Organization was formed, and at its founding Rabbani was named its chairman, Sayyaf its vice-chairman, and Hekmatyar—though still in prison for the murder of a Maoist student—its political director. The group, in this form anyway, was short-lived; after a failed uprising attempt in Panjshir Valley in 1975 where it failed to gain local support, the Republic's government of Sardar Mohammed Daoud Khan cracked down on Islamists, leading to all of the Muslim Youth leaders fleeing to Pakistan and the Organization itself ceased to exist. Its leaders continued to pursue its mission, however, and eventually went on to lead a successful insurgency war against the Marxist Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, backed by the Soviet Union, between 1979 and 1989.\n\n\nSpecific\n"}

The Institute teaches medicine – including specialities such as oncology, public health and mental health – as well as marine biology, veterinary medicine, biochemistry, and bioengineering.\n\nOn a wall of its main hall, the famous maxim of Abel Salazar can be read: \"The one who only knows about Medicine, does not even know about Medicine.\"\n\nThe Abel Salazar Institute of Biomedical Sciences was created after the revolution occurred in 1974. Driven by the post 25 April spirit, the Porto academy joins the eight existing faculties of medicine in the country. ICBAS was created in May 1975, in an annex to the Rectory of the University of Porto building. Its genesis was based on a set of great principles, which shaped the profile that the Institute still has today: solid basic education and focus on advanced training, research and innovation.\n\nCreated in 1975, at the initiative of a group of personalities from the University of Porto, including Corino de Andrade, Ruy Luís Gomes and Nuno Grande, and inspired by the thought and work of his patron Abel Salazar, the Abel Salazar Institute of Biomedical Sciences (ICBAS) was assumed from the outset as a multidisciplinary and multiprofessional school in the area of Life Sciences, in a broad sense, adopting the statement “A doctor who only understands medicine not even medicine understand” (José de Letamendi) as the School's motto. This maxim is recorded in the main lobby of the old building.\n\nMedical training at ICBAS began in 1976, based on an innovative pedagogical and institutional project different from traditional medical training. This project has evolved in the face of new challenges and is now an Integrated Master in accordance with the new Basic Law of the Education System, intended to apply the principles set out in the “Bologna Process”. The new curriculum philosophy promotes early clinical contact for students, with an integrated approach to clinical problems from the early stages of the course. The new model promotes training in an even more articulated way, whether in the most basic sciences or in purely clinical sciences. The programmatic space for a truly vocational training was reinforced during the 6th and last year. The balance between exact, biological, social and medical sciences taught by multidisciplinary teams has been and continues to be one of the most innovative pedagogical goals of medicine at ICBAS. Moreover, in order to achieve the goal of training doctors with the most comprehensive preparation possible, ICBAS and the Porto Hospital Center (HGSA - which has been operating as the nuclear hospital since 1980) collaborate in the formation of medicine. In addition, ICBAS has established protocols with several health institutions in Greater Porto, such as the Joaquim Urbano Hospital, the Portuguese Institute of Oncology of Porto, the Magalhães Lemos Hospital and the Vila Nova de Gaia Hospital Center. several Health Centers that receive students under a cooperation protocol with ARS Norte.\n\nICBA's medical course is now the Portuguese most sought after course medicine in the country.\n\n\nThe Students Group for the Promotion of Integrative Medicine was founded in 2004.\nThe students association - AEICBAS - has a website - www.aeicbasup.pt\n\n\n"}

Launched in mid-July 1944, the Red Army achieved its set objectives by the end of August.\n\nThe offensive was composed of three smaller operations:\n\nThe Lviv–Sandomierz Offensive is generally overshadowed by the overwhelming successes of the concurrently conducted Operation Bagration that led to the destruction of Army Group Centre. However, most of the Red Army and Red Air Force resources were allocated, not to Bagration's Belorussian operations, but the Lviv-Sandomierz operations. The campaign was conducted as Maskirovka. By concentrating in southern Poland and Ukraine, the Soviets drew German mobile reserves southward, leaving Army Group Centre vulnerable to a concentrated assault. When the Soviets launched their Bagration offensive against Army Group Center, it would create a crisis in the eastern German front, which would then force the powerful German Panzer forces back to the central front, leaving the Soviets free to then pursue their objectives in seizing the western Ukraine, Vistula bridgeheads, and gaining a foothold in Romania.\n\nBy early June 1944, the forces of \"Generalfeldmarschall\" Walter Model's Army Group North Ukraine had been pushed back beyond the Dniepr and were desperately clinging to the north-western corner of Ukraine. Joseph Stalin ordered the total liberation of Ukraine, and Stavka set in motion plans that would become the Lviv-Sandomierz Operation. In the early planning stage, the offensive was known as the Lvov-Przemyśl Operation. The objective of the offensive was for Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front to liberate Lviv and clear the German troops from Ukraine and capture a series of bridgeheads on the Vistula river.\n\nStavka was also planning an even larger offensive, codenamed Operation Bagration to coincide with Konev's offensive. The objective of Operation Bagration was no less than the complete liberation of Belarus, and also to force the Wehrmacht out of eastern Poland. The Lvov-Sandomierz Strategic Offensive Operation was to be the means of denying transfer of reserves by the OKH to Army Group Centre, thus earning itself the lesser supporting role in the summer of 1944.\n\nWhile the Stavka was concluding its offensive plans \"Generalfeldmarschall\" Model was removed from command of the Army Group North Ukraine and replaced by \"Generaloberst\" Josef Harpe. Harpe's force included two Panzer Armies: the 1st Panzer Army, under \"Generaloberst\" Gotthard Heinrici and the 4th Panzer Army under \"General der Panzertruppen\" Walther Nehring. Attached to the 1st Panzer Army was the Hungarian First Army. Harpe could muster only 420 tanks, StuG's and other assorted armoured vehicles. His Army Group comprised around 900,000 men; The Army Group was supported by the 700 aircraft of Luftflotte 4, including the veteran air units of \"VIII Fliegerkorps\", and the 300-400 aircraft of the nearby Luftflotte 6. However, due to the complicated inter-service chain of command, Harpe could not directly control the Luftwaffe units.\n\nThe 1st Ukrainian Front forces under Konev considerably outnumbered the Army Group North Ukraine. The 1st Ukrainian Front could muster over 1,002,200 troops, some 2,050 tanks, about 16,000 guns and mortars, and over 3,250 aircraft of the 2nd Air Army commanded by General Stepan Krasovsky. In addition the morale of Konev's troops was extremely high following the recent victories in Ukraine. They had been on the offensive for almost a year, and were witnessing the collapse of Army Group Centre to their North.\n\nThe 1st Ukrainian Front attack was to have two axes of attack. The first, aiming towards Rava-Ruska, was to be led by 3rd Guards, 1st Guards Tank and 13th Armies. The second pincer was aimed at Lviv itself, and was to be led by 60th, 38th, 3rd Guards Tank and 4th Tank Armies. The Red Army achieved massive superiority against the Germans by limiting their attacks to a front of only 26 kilometres. Konev had concentrated some 240 guns and mortars per kilometer of front.\n\nThe northern attack towards Rava-Ruska began on 13 July 1944. The 1st Ukrainian Front forces easily broke through near Horokhiv. The weakened Wehrmacht XLII Army Corps managed to withdraw relatively intact using reinforced rearguard detachments. By nightfall, the 1st Ukrainian Front's 13th Army had penetrated the German lines to a depth of 20 kilometers. The 1st Ukrainian Front's breakthrough occurred to the north of the XIII Army Corps.\n\nOn 14 July 1944, the assault with the objective of liberating Lviv was begun to the south of the XIII Army Corps, which had positions near the town of Brody, an area of Red Army failure earlier in the war. Red Army units had punched through the line near Horokhiv to the north and at Nysche in the south, leaving the XIII Corps dangerously exposed in a salient. The northern pincer towards Rava-Ruska now began to split, turning several units of the 13th Army south in an attempt to encircle XIII Army Corps.\n\nThe northern forces soon encountered weak elements of the 291st and 340th Infantry Divisions, but these were quickly swept aside. On 15 July, \"Generaloberst\" Nehring, realising his 4th Panzer Army was in serious jeopardy, ordered his two reserve divisions, the 16th and 17th Panzer Divisions to counterattack near Horokiv and Druzhkopil in an attempt to halt the Soviet northern assault. The two divisions could muster only 43 tanks between them and despite their best efforts, the German counterattack soon bogged down. The massively superior Red Army forces soon forced the two Panzer divisions to join the retreating infantry divisions. Konev ordered Mobile Group Baranov into the breach to help exploit the breakthrough. The Mobile Group advanced quickly, under cover of air support, and over the next three days managed to capture the town of Kamionka Strumilowa and to seize and hold a bridgehead on the western bank of the Southern Bug River, thus cutting the XIII Army Corps' line of communication and cutting off their path of retreat.\n\nTo the south, a major Red Army assault aimed at the juncture of the 1st and 4th Panzer Armies had been successfully repulsed on 14 July by the division-sized Korpsabteilung C. The 1st Ukrainian Front shifted their attack further south, and after an immense artillery and air bombardment assaulted the already weakened 349th and 357th Infantry Divisions. The 349th Infantry Division collapsed under the assault, the survivors falling back in disarray. Due to the actions of Korpsabteilung C and 357th Infantry Division, the 1st Ukrainian Front breakthrough was only 3-4 kilometers wide. Despite this, the 1st Ukrainian Front continued to advance towards the towns of Zolochiv and Sasiv, driving a wedge between XIII Army Corps and the neighboring XLVIII Panzer Corps.\n\nGerman artillery from both Corps and the 18th Artillery Division began saturating the narrow salient, dubbed the \"Koltiv Corridor\". A hasty counterattack by the 1st Panzer and 8th Panzer Divisions took place, accompanied by elements of the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS \"Galizien\" (1st Ukrainian). While the \"Galizien\" and 1st Panzer fought well, the 8th Panzer division got lost, and found itself in the XIII Army Corps area. Cut off from the XLVIII Panzer Corps and the 1st Panzer Division, it was unable to take part in the attack. Despite initial gains, the 1st Ukrainian Front finally managed to halt the German attack, with the help of the 2nd Air Army which dropped 17,200 bombs on the attacking \"panzers\". The absence of 8th Panzer Division meant that the attack was doomed to fail. The commander of 8th Panzer had ignored explicit orders, and attempted to lead his force on a short cut. Instead, the division was strung out on the Zolochiv - Zboriv section of the Lviv - Ternopil road, and suffered immense losses from Red Air Force Il-2s. Despite this, the southern attack was slowing.\n\nOn 16 July, Konev took a great risk and committed Lieutenant General Pavel Rybalko's 3rd Guards Tank Army to the southern assault. This meant that the Army would have to travel through the narrow \"Koltiv Corridor\", constantly under artillery fire and fierce German counterattacks. The 3rd Guards Tank tilted the balance in the Lviv direction, and soon the Soviet advance resumed its advance west. The commander of the XIII Army Corps realised that his Corps needed to retreat if it were to avoid encirclement. The order was given for all Corps units to fall back to the \"Prinz-Eugen-Stellung\", a series of unmanned defensive positions built in June 1944 which ran partly along the Strypa river about 35 km west of Ternopil. Strong 1st Ukrainian Front attacks throughout 17 July succeeded in capturing parts of the \"Prinz-Eugen-Stellung\". The 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS joined the combat in an attempt to recapture these lost positions, but after some success ran into a unit of Soviet IS-2 tanks which put an end to the SS advance. Despite repeated warnings from his subordinates, the Corps commander, \"General der Infanterie\" Arthur Hauffe, did not order further withdrawal, condemning the three XIII Army Corps divisions and Korps-Abteilung C in the Brody salient to their fate.\n\nOn 18 July, renewed 1st Ukrainian Front attacks resulted in a breakthrough in the Lviv operational direction. Late in the day, the 1st Ukrainian Front spearheads met near the town of Busk. The encirclement was complete. 45,000 men of the XIII Army Corps were trapped around Brody, and a 200 km breach had been created along the Army Group North Ukraine's front.\n\nFor the men trapped at Brody, help would not come. Despite several desperate attacks by the exhausted and under strength forces of XLVIII Panzer Corps and XXIV Panzer Corps, the 1st Ukrainian Front cordon continued to tighten. Under continued 1st Ukrainian Front attacks, Harpe ordered his forces to fall back, abandoning the trapped XIII Army Corps. Under constant artillery and aerial bombardment, the beleaguered forces made several breakout attempts, but these were easily repulsed by the 1st Ukrainian Front armoured forces and the Germans suffered heavy casualties. On 22 July, a 1st Ukrainian Front attack cut the pocket in two, and by nightfall almost all resistance had been eliminated. The scattered survivors broke up into small groups and attempted to break out. Few reached Axis lines, but among them were 3,500 men of the \"Galizien\" SS. Before the operation, the division had numbered 11,000 men. Konev was elated at the unexpected success of the operation. Harpe's Army Group was falling back; the 4th Panzer Army to the Vistula River and the 1st Panzer Army along with 1st Hungarian Army to the area around the Carpathian Mountains.\n\nLviv itself was occupied again by the Soviets on 26 July, the first time being in September 1939. This time, the city was retaken by the 1st Ukrainian Front, a Soviet force, relatively easily. The Germans had been completely forced out from Western Ukraine. Seeing this success, Stavka issued new orders on 28 July. Konev was to attack across the Vistula and to capture the city of Sandomierz, in Nazi-occupied southern Poland. Ukrainian hopes of independence were squashed amidst the overwhelming force of the Soviets, much like in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The Ukrainian Insurgent Army, UPA, would continue waging a guerrilla war against the Soviets well into the 1950s.\n\nThe renewed Soviet offensive got underway on 29 July, with Konev's spearheads quickly reaching the Vistula and establishing a strong bridgehead near Baranów Sandomierski. However, strong German counterattacks near Sandomierz prevented further expansion of the Soviet bridgehead. In early August, Harpe gained some respite. Five divisions, including one Panzer division, were transferred from Army Group South Ukraine. These were immediately thrown into action around Sandomierz. Soon after, another five German divisions, three Hungarian divisions, six StuG brigades and the 501st Heavy Tank Battalion (equipped with Tiger II tanks) were placed under Harpe's command.\n\nLarge-scale German counterattacks were launched in an attempt to throw the Soviets back across the Vistula. Using the towns of Mielec and Tarnobrzeg on the eastern bank of the river as bases, these attacks caused heavy casualties to the Soviet forces. By mid-August, Konev's spearhead, the 6th Guards Tank Corps had only 67 tanks remaining. The Germans launched a fierce counterattack with the 501st Heavy Tank Battalion and the 16th Panzer Division, totaling around 140 tanks including 20 Tiger IIs. Despite being heavily outnumbered, the 6th Guards held the bridgehead, knocking out 10 Tiger IIs. By 16 August, the German counterattacks were beginning to lose steam, and Rybalko, the commander of the bridgehead, was able to expand the Soviet controlled area by a depth of 120 kilometers, capturing the city of Sandomierz. With both sides exhausted, the fighting died down and the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive was deemed complete.\n\n1st Ukrainian Front (Konev)\n\n\n\nArmy Group North Ukraine (\"Generaloberst\" Josef Harpe) - 12 July 1944\n\nWehrmacht reports stressed the successful withdrawal of several forces, in line with the Frieser estimate. Soviet estimates were considerably higher: according to an August 1944 report by the Soviet Information Bureau, German forces suffered 350,000 casualties. Of these, 140,000 were killed and 32,360 captured, primarily in the Brody pocket. Additionally, the Soviets claimed to have taken out 1,941 German tanks and 687 aircraft during the offensive.\n\n"}
{"id": "2133937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2133937", "title": "Édouard Glissant", "text": "Édouard Glissant\n\nÉdouard Glissant (21 September 1928 – 3 February 2011) was a French writer, poet, philosopher, and literary critic from Martinique. He is widely recognised as one of the most influential figures in Caribbean thought and cultural commentary.\n\nÉdouard Glissant was born in Sainte-Marie, Martinique. He studied at the Lycée Schoelcher, named after the abolitionist Victor Schoelcher, where the poet Aimé Césaire had studied and to which he returned as a teacher. Césaire had met Léon Damas there; later in Paris they would join with Léopold Senghor, a poet and the future first president of Senegal, to formulate and promote the concept of \"negritude\". Césaire did not teach Glissant, but did serve as an inspiration to him (although Glissant sharply criticized many aspects of his philosophy); another student at the school at that time was Frantz Fanon.\n\nGlissant left Martinique in 1946 for Paris, where he received his PhD, having studied ethnography at the Musée de l'Homme and History and philosophy at the Sorbonne. He established, with Paul Niger, the separatist Front Antillo-Guyanais pour l'Autonomie party in 1959, as a result of which Charles de Gaulle barred him from leaving France between 1961 and 1965. He returned to Martinique in 1965 and founded the Institut martiniquais d'études, as well as \"Acoma\", a social sciences publication. Glissant divided his time among Martinique, Paris and New York; since 1995, he was Distinguished Professor of French at the CUNY Graduate Center. Before his tenure at CUNY Graduate Center, he was a professor at Louisiana State University in the Department of French and Francophone Studies from 1988-1993. In January 2006, Glissant was asked by Jacques Chirac to take on the presidency of a new cultural centre devoted to the history of slave trade.\n\nShortlisted for the Nobel Prize in 1992, when Derek Walcott emerged as the recipient, Glissant was the pre-eminent critic of the \"Négritude\" school of Caribbean writing and father-figure for the subsequent Créolité group of writers that includes Patrick Chamoiseau and Raphaël Confiant. While his first novel portrays the political climate in 1940s Martinique, through the story of a group of young revolutionaries, his subsequent work focuses on questions of language, identity, space, history, and knowledge and knowledge production. For example, in his text \"Poetics of Relation\", Glissant explores the concept of opacity, which is the lack of transparency, the untransability, the unknowability. And for this reason, opacity has the radical potentiality for social movements to challenge and subvert systems of domination. Glissant demands for the \"right to opacity,\" indicating the oppressed—which have historically been constructed as the Other—can and should be allowed to be opaque, to not be completely understood, and to simply exist as different. The colonizer perceived the colonized as different and unable to be understood, thereby constructing the latter as the Other and demanding transparency so that the former could somehow fit them into their cognitive schema and so that they could dominate over them. However, Glissant rejects this transparency and defends opacity and difference because other modes of understanding do exist. That is, Gliisant calls for understanding and accepting difference without measuring that difference to an \"ideal scale\" and comparing and making judgments, \"without creating a hierarchy\"—as Western thought has done.\n\nIn the excerpt from \"Poetics of Relation, \"\"The Open Boat\", Glissant's imagery was particularly compelling when describing the slave experience and the linkage between a slave and the homeland and the slave and the unknown. This poem paralleled Dionne Brand's book in calling the \"Door of No Return\" an Infinite Abyss. This image conveys emptiness sparked by unknown identity as it feels deep and endless. \"The Open Boat\" also discussed the phenomenon of \"falling into the belly of the whale\" which elicits many references and meanings. This image parallels the Biblical story of Jonah and the Whale, realizing the gravity of biblical references as the Bible was used as justification for slavery. More literally, Glissant related the boat to a whale as it \"devoured your existence\". As each word a poet chooses is specifically chosen to aid in furthering the meaning of the poem, the word \"Falling\" implies an unintentional and undesirable action. This lends to the experience of the slaves on the ship as they were confined to an overcrowded, filthy, and diseased existence among other slaves, all there against their will. All of Glissant's primary images in this poem elicit the feeling of endlessness, misfortune, and ambiguity, which were arguably the future existence of the slaves on ships to \"unknown land\".\n\nSlave ships did not prioritize the preservation of cultural or individual history or roots, but rather only documented the exchange rates for the individuals on the ship, rendering slaves mere possessions and their histories part of the abyss. This poem also highlights an arguable communal feeling through shared relationship to the abyss of personal identity. As the boat is the vessel that permits the transport of known to unknown, all share the loss of sense of self with one another. The poem also depicts the worthlessness of slaves as they were expelled from their \"womb\" when they no longer required 'protection' or transport from within it. Upon losing exchange value, slaves were expelled overboard, into the abyss of the sea, into another unknown, far from their origins or known land.\n\nThis \"relation\" that Glissant discusses through his critical work conveys a \"shared knowledge\". Referring back to the purpose of slaves—means of monetary and property exchange—Glissant asserts that the primary exchange value is in the ability to transport knowledge from one space or person to another—to establish a connection between what is known and unknown.\n\nGlissant's development of the notion of \"antillanité\" seeks to root Caribbean identity firmly within \"the Other America\" and springs from a critique of identity in previous schools of writing, specifically the work of Aimé Césaire, which looked to Africa for its principal source of identification. He is notable for his attempt to trace parallels between the history and culture of the Creole Caribbean and those of Latin America and the plantation culture of the American south, most obviously in his study of William Faulkner. Generally speaking, his thinking seeks to interrogate notions of centre, origin and linearity, embodied in his distinction between atavistic and composite cultures, which has influenced subsequent Martinican writers' trumpeting of hybridity as the bedrock of Caribbean identity and their \"creolised\" approach to textuality. As such he is both a key (though underrated) figure in postcolonial literature and criticism, but also he often pointed out that he was close to two French philosophers, Félix Guattari and Gilles Deleuze, and their theory of the rhizome.\n\nGlissant died in Paris, France, at the age of 82.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

For the Hindus at Bombay Gymkhana, Nayudu hit 153 in 116 minutes with 11 sixes. One of the sixes, off Bob Wyatt, landed on the roof of the Gymkhana. The MCC presented him with a silver bat in recognition of that innings. He was also the first Indian cricketer to endorse a brand (Bathgate Liver Tonic) in 1941. The Government of India awarded him the third highest (then second highest) civilian honour of Padma Bhushan in 1956.\n\nNayudu was born on 31 October 1895 in Bara Bada Nagpur to Cottari Surya Prakash Rao Nayudu, son of Rai Bahadur Cottari Narayana Swamy Nayudu, a wealthy Balija Nayudu, from Machilipatnam, Andhra Pradesh, a lawyer and landlord owning several villages and sizable chunk in Nagpur. Besides being a flourishing lawyer, he was a pioneer member of All India National Congress party.\n\nNarayana Swamy was affluent enough to send both his sons to England for further studies. His elder son, Cottari Vekatramana Nayudu, was married to the daughter of Raja Prabhakar Moorthy of Eluru and had one son by the name of Cottari Ranga Rao Nayudu who was also an advocate from England. The younger son, Cottari Surya Prakash Rao Nayudu, had four sons and two daughters, did his B.A. and M.A at Downing College, Cambridge University and was called to the Middle Temple Bar in 1891. He was acclaimed for his physical prowess and known as Hercules in Cambridge varsity campus. He was Justice in High Court of Holkar State for some years and functioned as Chief Justice for some time. Maharaja Shivaji Rao Holkar was ruler in those days. The Maharajah had put on record that he had faith in only two persons- Surya Prakash Rao being the first and K.S.

{"id": "2133956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2133956", "title": "Bawean", "text": "Bawean\n\nBawean () is an island of Indonesia located approximately 150 km north of Surabaya in the Java Sea, off the coast of Java. It is administered by Gresik Regency of East Java province. It is approximately 15 km in diameter and is circumnavigated by a single narrow road. Bawean is dominated by an extinct volcano at its center that rises to 655 m above sea level. Its population as of the 2010 Census is about 70,000 people, but more than 26,000 of them (that is about 70% of the male population) were temporarily living outside, working in other parts of Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia). As a result, females constituted about 77% of the actual population of the island, which is thus often referred to as \"the Island of Women\" ().\n\nThe island territory is divided into two administrative districts, Sangkapura and Tambak. More than half the population (about 45,750) lives in the district of Sangkapura, centred on the town of that name located on the southern coast of the island. The island has rich nature with many endemic species, such as Bawean deer which is only found on the island and is included to the IUCN Red List. There are several large underwater petroleum and gas fields around the island.\n\nThe island's name is believed to originate from the Kawi (or Sanskrit) phrase \"ba\" (light) \"we\" (the sun) \"an\" (is) - thus: \"having the sunlight\". According to the legend, Javanese sailors wandering in the mist in 1350 named the island because they saw a glimpse of light around it; previously the island bore the Arabic name of Majidi.\n\nDuring the Dutch colonization in the 18th to the 20th centuries, the island was renamed Lubok, but the locals and even the Dutch continued to use the name \"Bawean\". The Dutch name fell out of use in the 1940s.\n\nAs a linguistic variation, the island is also called Boyan and its natives Boyanese. These names are also common in Malaysia and Singapore, being brought there by numerous visitors from Bawean. Another popular appellation is \"the island of women\" (). This originates from the predominance of the actual female population, as since the 19th century most males have taken part-time jobs outside Bawean. So whereas the nominal female population percentage amounted to about 52% in 2009, the actual fraction (corrected for residents abroad) approximated 77%. This imbalance has become the subject of national and international studies.\n\nIt is uncertain when humans first settled on Bawean. In the early Middle Ages ships sailing across the Java Sea often used the harbor on the island. The first records of permanent settlements on the island date to the 15th century. Most of the references to Bawean in regional (mostly Javanese) sources of the 16–17th centuries are associated with visits to the island of Muslim preachers. Mass conversion of islanders to Islam began after the death in 1601 of the local Raja Bebileono who favored animism and the arrival from Java of the Muslim theologian Sheik Maulana Umar Mas'ud. His dynasty became independent from the Javanese States, and his great-great-grandson Purbonegoro, who ruled the island between 1720 and 1747 visited Java as a sovereign ruler. The graves of Maulana and Purbonegoro are revered on the island, they are visited by Muslim pilgrims from other parts of Indonesia and are the main historical attractions of Bawean.\n\nDutch sailors first visited Bawean during their trading expedition to Java led by the explorer Cornelis de Houtman – on 11 January 1597, the badly damaged expedition ship \"Amsterdam\" was abandoned and set on fire off the Bawean coast. In the 17–18th centuries, the island was regularly visited by ships of the Dutch East India Company, which was strengthening its position in this part of the Malayan archipelago, and in 1743 officially came under its control. The Island had little economic value and was used as a resting stop for ships sailing between Java and Borneo.\n\nAfter the bankruptcy and liquidation of the East India Company in 1798, Bawean and all its other possessions came under the direct control of the Netherlands Crown. Whereas the island was governed by an appointed Dutch official, native nobility retained certain influence, and the Muslim institutions of justice settled local court matters. The Bawean religious court () was established in 1882.\n\nSince the end of 19th century, men of the island began to regularly travel to work in the British colonial possessions in the Malay Peninsula, especially in Singapore. The Dutch authorities do not interfere with the activities of foreign recruiters who visited the island, as Bawean, with about 30,000 people and 66 settlements was overpopulated. The island was then producing tobacco, Indigo, cotton fabrics and coal, and exported the Bawean deer and local breed of horse. Large-scale planting of teak started in the 1930s and resulted in deforestation of most of the island.\n\nDuring World War II, large-scale battles between the Japanese and Allied navies occurred in the vicinity of Bawean island, especially during the Dutch East Indies campaign of 1941–1942. On 25 February 1942, the island was captured by the Japanese troopers. On 28 February, in the first Battle of the Java Sea, the Japanese sunk several Allied ships, killing the commander of the East Indies Fleet, Rear Admiral Karel Doorman, on the light cruiser \"De Ruyter\". The Second Battle of the Java Sea, also known as The Battle off Bawean, was fought on 1 March 1942. It resulted in sinking of all the participating Allied ships, including the heavy cruiser HMS Exeter and effective termination of the Anglo-Dutch resistance in the region. In August 1945, the Japanese garrison on the island surrendered to the Anglo-Dutch forces.\n\nAfter the proclamation of the independent Republic of Indonesia on 17 August 1945 the island formally became a part of the new state. However, it remained \"de facto\" under Dutch control, and in February 1948, together with Madura and several other islands, was included in the quasi-independent state Madura promoted by the Government of the Netherlands. It joined the Republic of the United States of Indonesia () in December 1949, and finally the Republic of Indonesia in March 1950.\n\nThe island is located in the Java Sea about 150 km north of the larger island of Madura. It has a nearly round shape with the diameter varying between 11 and 18 km and giving an average value of 15 km. The shores are winding and contain many small bays; there are many small sandy islands (\"noko\"), rocks and coral reefs off the coast with the size up to 600 meters. The largest inhabited satellite islands are Selayar, Selayar Noko, Noko Gili, Gili Timur and Nusa.\n\nMost of the island is hilly, except for the narrow coast and a plain in the southwestern part; it is therefore also called locally as \"island of 99 hills\". The highest point (655 m) is at the hill (that literally means \"high mountain\"). The greatest heights are in the central and eastern parts of the island. Here are a few caldera lakes, the largest being the Lake Kastoba (). It has an area of about 0.3 km, depth of 140 meters, and is located at an altitude of about 300 meters. There are several small rivers and waterfalls, the highest being Laccar and Patar Selamat, as well as hot springs such as Kebun Daya and Taubat.\n\nThe climate is tropical monsoonal, slightly less humid than the average in this part of Indonesia. Annual and daily temperature fluctuations are small, with the average maximum of 30 °C and the average minimum of 24.5 °C. Rainy season lasts from December to March, and the average monthly precipitation ranges from 402 mm in December to 23 mm in August. Northwesterly and easterly winds dominate the rainy and dry periods, respectively.\n\nThe island originated from a volcano located near its center. Igneous rocks make about 85% of its surface with occasional limestone, sandstone and dolomite. The soil in low-lying coastal areas is mainly alluvial, with a predominance of sand and gray clay. At altitudes of 10–30 meters above sea level, older alluvial accretions show up as horizontal layers of brown clay, and the higher areas are dominated by red-brown laterite.\n\nThe area is considered seismically active, with frequent tremors which are companied by landslides. The island has deposits of coal and onyx which are being mined from the early 2000s. There are oil and gas fields in the underwater shelf around the island, which are among the largest in Indonesia. Their development started in the 1960s and is being conducted now by the national company Pertamina and several foreign companies.\n\nThe fauna of Bawean Island is generally quite similar to that of Java. Initially, most of the island was covered by rainforest, but as a result of human activity its area gradually declined and by the end of the 20th century was not more than 10% of the island. About 15% is occupied by the artificially planted common teak (\"Tectona grandis\").\n\nThe local jungles are characterized by dense low understory with a predominance of ferns, bryophytes and orchids. The most common tree species are \"Ficus\", \"Nauclea\" and \"Symplocos adenophylla\". Some plant species do not occur in the nearby Java Island, such as \"Canarium asperum\", \"Pternandra coerulescens\", \"Pternandra rostrata\", \"Champera manilana\", \"Ixora miquelii\", \"Phanera lingua\" and \"Irvingia malayana\". Mangrove bushes occur in some coastal areas of the island, with the main species being \"Sonneratia alba\", \"Rhizophora mucronata\", \"Bruguiera cylindrica\" and \"Lumnitzera racemosa\".The most notable representative of the fauna of the island is the endemic local species of deer known as Bawean deer, Kuhl's hog deer or Bawean hog deer (\"Hyelaphus kuhlii\"). It is considered a symbol of Bawean and is protected by Indonesian law. With less than 250 individuals, of which more than 90% belong to a single population, it is considered \"critically endangered\" and is included into the IUCN Red List.\n\nBawean hosts other rare mammals, such as crab-eating macaque (\"Macaca fascicularis\"), Sunda porcupine (\"Hystrix javanica\"), small Indian civet (\"Viverricula indica\"), Asian palm civet (\"Paradoxurus hermaphroditus\"). Most common birds are black-crowned night heron (\"Nycticorax nycticorax\"), purple heron (\"Ardea purpurea\"), great frigatebird (\"Fregata minor\") and gull-billed tern (\"Gelochelidon nilotica\"). Reptiles are represented by different kinds of lizards (\"Varanus\" sp .), reticulated python (\"Python reticulatus\") and saltwater crocodile (\"Crocodylus porosus\") which sometimes (rarely) swims to the island.\n\nNature conservation measures were being taken back when Bawean was under colonial administration of the Netherlands. In 1932, five forests with the total area of 4,556 hectares were declared natural reserves. In 1979, two national (Indonesian) nature reserves were created with areas of 3,832 and 725 ha, mostly to protect the forests and the habitat of the Bawean deer.\n\nBawean belongs to the province of East Java (). From 1975 it is a part of the Regency (\"kabupaten\") of Gresik. The island is divided into two administrative districts (\"kecamatan\"): Sangkapura and Tambak; each district is based around the towns of the same names. Sangkapura District includes 17 villages, and is headed by M. Suhami. Tambak District contains 13 villages, and is headed by B.S. Sofyan. Their areas and populations at the 2010 Census were as follows:\n\nThe main source of income for the majority of the Bawean population is money earned by relatives working abroad. The islanders are mainly engaged in growth of rice, maize, potato and coconuts. Yields are lower than in Java because of significantly lower levels of agricultural mechanization and more frequent droughts. Another common economical activities are fishing and growth of teak. The industry is represented by a few handicraft workshops. From 2006 onyx is being mined and in the central part of the island by several Taiwanese companies.\n\nIn 2009, the island had about 30 schools. Many young people go for their studies to Java and rarely return to the island.\nThe island has several pharmacies and small clinics, but no hospital. Despite lack of equipment, local athletes are among the best in the county, especially in table tennis and a popular in Southeast Asia ball game sepak takraw (wherein a liana-woven ball is kicked over the net). Volleyball became popular in the 2000s with about 80 officially registered teams on the island.\n\nThe main ring road runs along the coast of the island; it has a length of about 55 km and 33 km of it are in poor condition. There are motorised vehicles, but most travel is done by bicycle, horse and cart, or becak. The main port of the island, Sangkapura, is connected with the settlements of northern coast of East Java and Madura. The busiest shipping route is Sangkapura – Gresik.\n\nGovernments – both local and of Gresik – are attempting to appeal Bawean for tourists by advertising local natural attractions, which include the Lake Kastoba, hot springs Kebundaya and Taubat, waterfalls Lachchar and Patar Selamat, the caves in the central part of the island, sandy beaches and coral reefs on the coast. However, poor infrastructural development of the island, combined with its remoteness from Java, hinders the development of tourism here. In addition, some locals regard Kastoba as a sacred lake and protest visiting it by tourists.\n\nIn early 2013, Bawean Airport had a runway of 800 metres length, and at least two aviation companies made proposals to the local authority to fly to and from Bawean. The runway has since been extended to 1,200 metres length and it can accommodate 50-seater aircraft. As the local authority was not ready to operate the airport, they handed control of the airport over to the central government. It was predicted to operate in May 2015; however, operations at the Harun Thohir Airport were officially begun in January 2016.\n\nThe high migration hinders accurate count of the number of people living on the island. In 2009, the number of residents was 74,319, of which at least 26,000 were living abroad – in Malaysia, Singapore and, to a lesser extent, in Java and other areas in Indonesia. The southern coast of the island is most densely populated with more than half of the islanders living in the city of Sangkapura.\n\nBetween about 1900 and 1930, the population was stable at the level of 30,000. It then rose, from 29,860 in 1930 to 59,525 in 1964, owing to the improving living conditions and arrival of new settlers from Madura. The growth rate then decreased and remains at 1% or higher per year.\n\nMost people inhabiting the island in the 15–16th centuries were from Madura and, to a lesser extent, from Java islands. They were gradually mixed with traders, fishermen and pirates of Bugis and Malayan ethnicities coming from other parts of the Malay Archipelago. They were later joined by migrants from the Sumatran city of Palembang, who formed a community and took a dominant position in trade. By the beginning of the 20th century Baweans represented a fairly homogeneous ethnic community, and while living abroad formed compact communities and identified themselves as Baweans rather than other Indonesian groups.\n\nRecent migrations to the island are small and are mostly composed of Javanese people who have certain interests on the island. Several hundred Javanese live on the island of Gili Barat which is connected to Bawean with a dam. They are engaged in growing coconut palms (\"Cocos nucifera\"). Newcoming Javanese are distinguished from the old Javanese settlers who live in the village Dipongo and speak an old-Javanese dialect.\n\nA small Chinese community has existed on the island since at least the late 19th century. It is increasing both by natural growth and via mixed marriages of Baweans and Singaporese.\n\nBaweans, working abroad form compact communities, some of which are known for over 150 years. For example, there were at least 763 Baweans in Singapore in 1849, most of whom lived in the area known as (\"Bawean village\"). Later, districts with the same name appeared in several parts of Malaysia. The largest migrations from the island occurred in the later 1940s – early 1950s, during the formation of Indonesia as an independent state and the associated political instability and economic difficulties. So in 1950, there were 24,000 Baweans in Singapore alone. Most Baweans living abroad keep close ties with their relatives on the island, regularly visit them, and often return after several years of absence.\n\nThe migrations from the island are mostly caused by lack of jobs in a small densely populated island and low incomes. There are generations of recruitment agents in Singapore and Malaysia specializing on employment of Baweans, mainly as construction workers and sailors. This migration also became a part of life, it is believed on the island that a man is not mature enough until he spends several years abroad. So a poll in the 2008–2009 revealed that only 55% of the locals justified the departure by economic reasons, while 35% associated it with the traditions or a desire to gain life experience.\n\nMost population speaks a Bawean dialect, which is regarded as the most lexically and phonetically peculiar dialect of Madurese language; Baweans living in Singapore and Malaysia speak its slight variation called . Virtually the entire population knows, to a various degree, the official language of the country – Indonesian. The predominant religion on the island is Sunni Islam, with some remnants of the traditional local beliefs.\n\nTraditional dwellings are quite similar on the Madura and Bawean islands. They have a bamboo frame, with porch, often on low poles. The roof is traditionally covered with palm leaves or reeds, but tile is becoming increasingly popular.\n\nLocal costume is closer to that of Java than Madura. Men wear sarong (a kind of kilt) and a long-skirted tunic, and women are dressed in sarong and a shorter jacket. There are Malayan and Bugis varieties of dress. The Malayan influence is more noticeable in the customs, ceremonies and folk dances, where the Madura heritage is weak. Also absent on the island are such traditional Madura elements as bull races and sickle-shaped knives.\n\nThe local cuisine is diverse and borrows from all local ethnicities. The traditional local pie stuffed with vegetables (usually potatoes) is popular in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore under the name (Bawean bread).\n\n\n\n"}

The film stars Rutger Hauer as the commander of \"K-219\" and claims to be based on the true story, also described in the 1997 book of the same name. The film was produced by World Productions for the BBC and HBO, in association with Invision Productions and UFA Filmproduktions. It was written by Troy Kennedy Martin and directed by David Drury, and was first transmitted on BBC One on 26 July 1997.\n\n\"K-219\" performs a Crazy Ivan, and USS \"Aurora\" collides with her, causing a rupture of the seal on one of its ballistic missile tubes. The leaking seawater causes a corrosive reaction which floods the sub with toxic gas. The corrosive reaction starts a fire that floods the sub with more toxic gas, and smoke.\n\nThe captain surfaces the boat and moves the crew out to the deck, and attempts to vent the sub. The chief engineer informs the captain that the fire may cook off the nukes and cause a nuclear explosion. The launch doors are opened on the sub to vent smoke.\n\n\"Aurora\" ascertains that a fire is aboard \"K-219\", and informs the Pentagon. The Pentagon, fearing radiological contamination of the Eastern Seaboard, orders \"Aurora\" to prepare to sink \"K-219\". The fact that the launch doors are open on the SLBMs causes consternation in Washington D.C., with calls for the immediate sinking of the sub, should it appear to be preparing to launch.\n\nThe captain of \"K-219\" prepares a bold plan to dive with the launch doors open, to flood the missile bay and quench the fires. As the captain dives the sub, \"Aurora\" prepares to fire, assuming \"K-219\" is setting about to launch its missiles. After a brief but heated argument the U.S. commander is convinced to wait before launching and realises that the Soviet sub is diving, rather than launching its SLBMs.\n\n\"K-219\"'s tactic works, and the sub resurfaces with the fires out. A new crisis develops: Both nuclear reactors are overheating, and the cooling rods must be lowered manually by two crew members who have only limited oxygen left. The rods are lowered, and both reactors are shut down, averting disaster, but one crew member remains locked inside the reactor room, running out of oxygen. With seawater flooding the submarine, the captain of \"K-219\" decides to abandon ship. Throughout the crisis, Washington insists that no information on the possibility of nuclear fallout along the eastern American coastline be leaked to the Governors and no evacuation plans be activated to protect the population, in order not to derail the forthcoming Reykjavik Summit between Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan.\n\nCapt.

The original First Edition, self-published in 1974 by Moosewood, was a spiral bound paper-covered book, with photographs of the restaurant staff, with illustrations hand-drawn and text hand-written by Molly Katzen. It was printed by the Glad Day Press in Ithaca. The full title of the self-published edition was The Moosewood Cookbook, Recipes from Moosewood Restaurant in the Dewitt Mall, Ithaca, New York. The book was then picked up by the then-fledgling Ten Speed Press in California, whose edition was given a different cover and hand-lettered and illustrated by Katzen. \n\nThe cookbook featured a number of the recipes favored by the restaurant at the time. Moosewood was listed by \"The New York Times\" as one of the top ten bestselling cookbooks of all time, and is likely the most popular vegetarian cookbook in the world.\n\nKatzen later rewrote the book with leaner recipes in a version published in 1992, long after her original association with the Collective had lapsed, though she kept the title and the hand-lettered style; the later Collective went on to publish its own unrelated series of books. Katzen has written two books that might be considered sequels; the first, called \"The Enchanted Broccoli Forest\", expands on topics such as baking that the Moosewood book does not cover in depth, and is done in the same hand-lettered style as the original. The second, \"The Vegetable Dishes I Can't Live Without\", came out in 2007 and returned to Katzen's original hand-written style after years of more conventionally designed books such as \"Still Life with Menu\" and \"Pretend Soup\".\n\nIn 2018 \"New York Magazine\" named it to their list of best vegan and vegetarian cookbooks, saying \"no chef cooking vegetables can afford not to read (it).\"\n\nIn 2017 \"Washington Post\" Food Editor Joe Yonan listed it as one of three must-have classic vegetarian cookbooks.\n\nIn 2007, the James Beard Foundation named the book to the Cookbook Hall of Fame. \"The New York Times\" has listed it as one of the ten best selling cookbooks of all time.\n"}

{"id": "2133976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2133976", "title": "Edward L. Doheny", "text": "Edward L. Doheny\n\nEdward Laurence Doheny (August 10, 1856 – September 8, 1935) was an American oil tycoon who, in 1892, drilled the first successful oil well in the Los Angeles City Oil Field. His success set off a petroleum boom in Southern California, and made him a fortune when, in 1902, he sold his properties.\n\nHe then began highly profitable oil operations in Tampico, Mexico's \"golden belt\", drilling the first well in the nation in 1901. He expanded operations during the Mexican Revolution, and opened large new oil fields in Lake Maracaibo (Venezuela). His holdings developed as the Pan American Petroleum & Transport Company, one of the largest oil companies in the world in the 1920s.\n\nIn the 1920s, Doheny was implicated in the Teapot Dome Scandal and accused of offering a $100,000 bribe to United States Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall. Doheny was twice acquitted of offering the bribe, but Fall was convicted of accepting it. Doheny and his second wife and widow, Carrie Estelle, were noted philanthropists in Los Angeles, especially regarding Catholic schools, churches and charities. The character J. Arnold Ross in Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel \"Oil!\" (the inspiration for the 2007 film \"There Will Be Blood\") is loosely based on Doheny.\n\nEdward L. Doheny was born in 1856 in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, to Patrick \"Pat\" and Eleanor Elizabeth \"Ellen\" (née Quigley) Doheny. The family was Irish Catholic. His father was born in Ireland, and fled Tipperary in the wake of the Great Famine. Patrick tried whaling after reaching Labrador. His mother was born in St. Johns, Newfoundland, and was a school teacher. After Patrick and Ellen married and moved to Wisconsin, Doheny's father became a construction laborer and gardener.\n\nDoheny graduated from high school in his fifteenth year, and was named the valedictorian of his class. Following his father's death several months after his graduation, Doheny was employed by the U.S. Geological Survey. In 1873 he was sent to Kansas with a party to survey and subdivide the Kiowa-Comanche lands. The following year he left the Geological Survey to pursue his fortune prospecting, first in the Black Hills of South Dakota, and then in Arizona Territory and New Mexico Territory.\n\nDoheny is listed in the 1880 United States Census as a painter living in Prescott, Arizona. Later in 1880, he was in the Black Range in western Sierra County of south-western New Mexico Territory, living in the rough silver-mining town of Kingston (about west of Hillsboro), prospecting, mining, and buying and trading mining claims. He worked in the famed Iron King mine, just north of Kingston, which drew men to the area. In Kingston, he met two men who later played important roles in his life: Albert Fall, the future Secretary of the Interior, and Charles A. Canfield, who became his business partner.\n\nDoheny and Canfield together worked the former's Mount Chief Mine with little success. In 1886, Canfield prospected further in the Kingston area, leasing and developing with great success the Comstock Mine (not to be confused with the Comstock Lode of Virginia City, Nevada). Doheny declined to join him in this venture, but Canfield made a small fortune from it. Doheny was eventually reduced to doing odd jobs (including painting) to support his family.\n\nIn 1883, in the Black Mountains town of Kingston in the New Mexico Territory, Doheny met and married his first wife, Carrie Louella Wilkins, on August 7. Their daughter, Eileen, was born in December 1885.\n\nIn the Spring of 1891, Doheny left New Mexico and moved to Los Angeles, California, attracted by Canfield's success in real estate there. Canfield had previously left New Mexico with $110,000 in cash from his Comstock Mine venture, which he parlayed into extensive real estate holdings during the Los Angeles boom of the later 1880s. With the collapse of the speculative fever, Canfield lost his wealth and land holdings and, by the time Doheny arrived in Los Angeles in 1891, he was deeply in debt.\n\nThe two men briefly tried prospecting in the San Diego County area of Southern California, forming the Pacific Gold and Silver Extracting Company there—but without achieving success, they soon returned to Los Angeles. By 1892, Doheny was so poor he could not afford to pay for his boarding room.\n\nDoheny's daughter Eileen was a frail child and died at age seven on December 14, 1892. Her death was caused by heart disease stemming from rheumatic fever, as well as a lung infection. Edward and Carrie's marriage was fragile, owing mostly to the harsh reality of mining life and their many financial problems. Eileen's death further strained the marriage. Nearly a year after Eileen's death, on November 6, 1893, Carrie gave birth to their only son Edward Jr., known as Ned.\n\nWhile in Los Angeles, Doheny found out that there were local reserves of natural asphalt, which in places came to the surface—notably at the La Brea Tar Pits. Doheny obtained a lease near downtown with $400 in financing from Canfield, who had made some money from the mining industry. In the fall of 1892, Doheny dug a well with picks, shovels, and a windlass, looking for asphalt, from which oil could be refined. When the well ( wide) reached , Doheny devised a drilling system involving a eucalyptus tree trunk. When completed in 1893, the well reached and produced . (The discovery of this well appears in John Jakes's novel \"California Gold,\"—as do Doheny and Canfield, as partners with the novel's fictional protagonist, Mack Chance.)\n\nEdward and Carrie Doheny divorced in 1899, when Ned was six years old. Edward gained custody of their son, and remarried. Unable to cope with her losses, the following year Carrie Doheny committed suicide. Doheny married his second wife, Carrie \"Estelle\" Betzold, inside the private Pullman car of Santa Fe Railway executive Almon Porter Maginnis (\"Car 214\"). It was held on the siding in New Mexico Territory on August 22, 1900. Though she bore no children, Carrie raised Ned.\n\nThe first well dug in Los Angeles was in 1863, on Hoover Street between Seventh Street and Wilshire Boulevard, by a man named Baker. However, in his book \"Petroleum in California: A Concise and Reliable History of the Oil Industry of the State\", Lionel V. Redpath says the Los Angeles oil industry began with the Doheny and Canfield well at the corner of Patton and West State streets. The well was a small producer, but it pumped steadily for three years, and during that time Doheny and others sunk about three hundred more wells. Doheny and Canfield soon made a fortune by drilling in the area and selling the oil to nearby factories. Later, they helped spur the California oil boom of the early 1900s by persuading railroads to switch from coal to oil to power their locomotives.\n\nDoheny was also a pioneering oil producer in Mexico. In Tampico his company drilled the first well in Mexico in 1901. He expanded operations during the Mexican Revolution, and opened large new oil fields in Mexico's \"golden belt\" inland from Tampico. It also drilled Cerro Azul No. 4 well—which, in February 1916, became the world's largest-producing well, pumping 260,000 barrels per day (B.P.D.). When the well—drilled by Herbert Wylie—came in, the sound could be heard away in Casiano, and it shot a stream of oil into the air, sending oil in a two-mile (three-kilometre) radius. Over the next fourteen years, the well produced over fifty-seven million barrels.\n\nDoheny formed the Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company (P.A.T.)—part of which later became the Mexican Petroleum Company (Pemex)—to hold his two Mexican companies (Mexican Petroleum and Huasteca), his Atlantic and Gulf Coasts facilities in the United States, and his California holdings. The company owned 600,000 acres (2400 km²) of land worth about $50,000,000 and secured an additional 800,000 acres (3200 km²) in Mexico in October 1919.\n\nIn 1919 the Colombian Petroleum Company, a P.A.T. subsidiary, bought a 75% interest in the Barco oil concession in Colombia. Doheny was also interested in plans to develop the oil industry in Venezuela, and in building a pipeline from Colombia to Venezuela to make it more economical to export the Barco oil from the west coast of Lake Maracaibo.\nIn 1920 Pan American was the largest oil company in the United States, ahead of Sinclair Consolidated Oil Corporation and Standard Oil Company of Indiana. Automobile production was booming and oil prices were high. The Mexican Petroleum Company was the largest in Mexico, and Mexico was the largest oil producer in the world.\nIn 1922 Albert B. Fall, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, leased the oil field at Elk Hills, California, to the Pan American Petroleum & Transport Company.\nAround the same time, the Teapot Dome Field in Wyoming was leased to Sinclair Consolidated Oil Corporation.\nBoth oilfields were part of the US Navy's petroleum reserves. Neither lease was subject to competitive bidding. \nIn 1924 rumors about corruption in the deals escalated into the Teapot Dome scandal.\n\nDoheny's reputation was somewhat tainted by a bribe paid to the Secretary of the Interior, Albert B. Fall in 1921. He made the \"gift\" of $100,000 in connection with obtaining a lease of 32,000 acres (130 km²) of government-owned land used for the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve near Taft, California. The resulting scandal broke soon after that, over similar bribes Fall accepted for leasing Teapot Dome in Wyoming. Doheny (his son Ned, who had delivered the money, and his assistant Hugh Plunkett, were also indicted) was charged with bribing Fall but, in 1930, was acquitted. Nevertheless, Fall was convicted of accepting the bribe.\n\nDoheny sold a majority of the family's shares in Pan American Petroleum & Transport to Standard Oil of Indiana, in April 1925, but retained all California assets, which he formed into a new company, Pan American Western Petroleum Company. Pan American Eastern Petroleum (the Mexico holdings, the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts holdings in the U.S., refineries, pipelines, and thirty-one tankers), which held the non-California assets, was sold to Standard. Pan American Western returned to its roots as an \"upstream\" exploration and production company.\n\nAt the end of 1925, in order to exploit the oilfields in Lake Maracaibo Pan American Western gained control of Lago Petroleum Corporation from C. Ledyard Blair's Blair & Co. The transaction became the subject of a stockholder action in 1933, which alleged that the bankers, who were represented on the Pan American board, conspired to make excessive profits. In 1926, Venezuelan Eastern Petroleum Corporation reorganized as a subsidiary of Pan American Eastern to buy and develop Venezuelan oil properties.\n\nIn the midst of the Teapot Dome scandal, Doheny gave Greystone Mansion (designed by Gordon B. Kaufmann after a design competition) to his son, Edward (Ned) L. Doheny, Jr., and his wife Lucy Marceline Smith (the couple married on June 10, 1914). He built the house in 1928, at a cost of $3,188,000, and sold the property and accompanying ranch to his son for $10.\n\nWhen a second criminal trial for bribery began to loom for Doheny and Fall in 1929, the pressure on all parties reached a breaking point. The Dohenys tried to persuade Hugh Plunkett to be committed to a mental institute so that he could not then be made to testify against them. On February 16 an argument broke out at about 10pm between Ned and Plunkett, Ned shot Plunkett and then himself. There were rumours that the two were having an affair. The full story was never clear. The police were not called until three hours after the shots had been fired, despite several members of the family being at home and having heard the yelling. The Los Angeles authorities immediately blamed Plunkett in the murder-suicide. In addition to the indictment of Edward Doheny in the Teapot Dome scandal, both Doheny and Plunkett had been indicted in the alleged bribe of Albert Fall—as Ned (accompanied by Plunkett) had delivered the money. They had already gone through some trials. Raymond Chandler, a former oil man, included a thinly veiled account of this event in one chapter of his novel \"The High Window,\" presenting it as a bygone, hushed-up case. He had started work for the Dabney Oil Syndicate in 1922 as a bookkeeper and auditor, but was fired a decade later.\n\nBeset by shareholder lawsuits in the wake of Teapot Dome, and the death of Ned, Doheny became a recluse and invalid. When she realized her husband needed an undisturbed home away for a while after the Teapot Dome travails and Ned's death, Carrie Estelle asked architect Wallace Neff to design and build the Ferndale Ranch complex on their Ojai, California property. Hundreds of workers completed the house in less than six weeks, including Neff's blueprints, by working day and night.\n\nEdward L. Doheny died at his Beverly Hills townhouse on September 8, 1935, of natural causes, a month after his seventy-ninth birthday. His funeral was in St. Vincent's Church in Los Angeles. That year \"Estelle Doheny, Doheny's widow, burned hundreds of letters and business documents,\" what biographer Margaret Leslie Davis describes as the \"written remnants of Edward Doheny's life\" (p. 4).\"\n\nDoheny contributed money to foundations. He helped fund the construction of St. Vincent de Paul Church. After the shooting death of his son, Edward Jr., he donated $1.1 million in 1932 to University of Southern California (USC) to build the Edward L. Doheny, Jr. Memorial Library. His second wife, Carrie Estelle Doheny, donated her rare book collection to St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, California.\nDoheny, Sr., meanwhile, lived in his own mansion, which he had purchased in 1901. It was part of Chester Place, a gated community of Victorian mansions, and by his death in 1935, Doheny ended up owning most of the houses, as well as the street. Built in 1899 in the French Gothic architectural style, this three-story, twenty-two-room residence was damaged in the 1933 earthquake but was repaired. It is within Mount Saint Mary's University's Doheny campus, where it houses college departments, runs docent tours, and hosts chamber music concerts by The Da Camera Society.\n\nThe Dohenys also owned a great deal of coastal land in Dana Point, California, which they donated to the State of California for Doheny State Beach as a memorial to Edward's murdered son Ned. They also donated the funds for the construction of St. Edward the Confessor Roman Catholic Church at its original site. It has since moved to a bluff-top location overlooking Doheny State Beach. The original building is now home to San Felipe de Jesus Roman Catholic Church.\n\nAfter he began basing his Mexican oil operations near Tampico, Tamaulipas in 1902, Doheny donated much money toward the construction and maintenance of the Cathedral of Tampico there. Also known as The Temple of the Immaculate Conception, it is located in Plaza de Armas in the city. The Doheny Estate has donated money to Loyola Marymount University for the construction of buildings and residence halls, and the land for one of the campuses of Mount St. Mary's College south of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nDoheny took his yacht, the \"Casiana\" (named after his first major producing oil well in Mexico, the Casiana No. 7), to Martinique to pick up a friend's brother who worked as a farmer on the island and who was seriously ill. Doheny brought him back to New York City; the steam yacht made the trip in only five days.\n\nIn 1944, his widow Carrie Estelle Doheny suffered a hemorrhage that left her partially blind. Realizing the value of good vision, she created and funded the Doheny Eye Institute, which has become a world leader in vision research. She became a major cultural philanthropist in Los Angeles, California as well. When commissioning new buildings for these civic projects, she often chose the renowned Southern California architect Wallace Neff. On her death, she left antiquities and funds to St. John's (Roman Catholic) Seminary located in Camarillo, in Ventura County.\n\nIn 1954, Estelle Doheny provided funds and \"a quantity of her precious collections in the library building\" at St. Mary's of the Barrens seminary in Perryville, Missouri. By November 11, 2000, the Vincentian Fathers signed a contract with Southeast Missouri State University to use the library building. So, \"the Doheny treasures were sold.\"\n\nDoheny and his first wife, Carrie Louella, had a daughter, Eileen, who died in childhood. Their son, Edward L. (\"Ned\") Doheny, Jr., was the owner of Greystone Mansion and the namesake of Doheny Library at the University of Southern California.\n\nThrough Ned's children, Doheny is the great-grandfather of science fiction writer Larry Niven and singer-songwriter Ned Doheny.\n\nNumerous place names in Southern California are named for him: \n\n\n\n"}

'Napoleon's Surgeon', Baron Dominique Jean Larrey, used horse-drawn carts as ambulances to quickly remove the wounded from the field of battle. This method became so successful that he was subsequently asked to organize the medical care for the 14 armies of the French Republic. With the partial exception of Great Britain, all of the states at the time did not keep especially accurate records, so calculating losses is to a certain extent a matter of conjuncture.\n\n\nPeninsular War:\n\nInvasion of Russia:\n\nThe effect of the war on France over this time period was considerable. Estimates of the total French losses during the wars vary from 500, 000 to 3 million dead. According to David Gates, the Napoleonic Wars cost France at least 916,000 men. This represents 38% of the conscription class of 1790–1795. This rate is over 14% higher than the losses suffered by the same generation one hundred years later fighting Imperial Germany. The French population suffered long-term effects through a low male-to-female population ratio. At the beginning of the Revolution, the numbers of males to females was virtually identical. By the end of the conflict only 0.857 males remained for every female. Combined with new agrarian laws under the Napoleonic Empire that required landowners to divide their lands to all their sons rather than the first born, France's population never recovered. By the middle of the 19th century France had lost its demographic superiority over Germany and Austria and even the United Kingdom.\n\n\nRoyal Navy, 1804–1815:\n\nTotal: 92,386.\n\nBritish Army, 1804–1815:\n\nTotal: 219,420\n\n Total: 3,500,000 casualties\n\nDavid Gates estimated that 5,000,000 died in the Napoleonic Wars. He does not specify if this number includes civilians or is just military.\n\nCharles Esdaile says 5,000,000–7,000,000 died overall, including civilians. These numbers are subject to considerable variation. Erik Durschmied, in his book \"The Hinge Factor\", gives a figure of 1.4 million French military deaths of all causes. Adam Zamoyski estimates that around 400,000 Russian soldiers died in the 1812 campaign alone. By contrast, Michael Clodfelter gives the figure of 289, 000 Russian battles between 1805-1814. Civilian casualties in the 1812 campaign were probably comparable. Alan Schom estimates some 3 million military deaths in the Napoleonic wars and this figure, once again, is supported elsewhere. Common estimates of more than 500,000 French dead in Russia in 1812 and 250,000–300,000 French dead in Iberia between 1808 and 1814 give a total of at least 750,000, and to this must be added hundreds of thousands of more French dead in other campaigns—probably around 150,000 to 200,000 French dead in the German campaign of 1813, for example. Thus, it is fair to say that the estimates above are highly conservative.\n\nCivilian deaths are impossible to accurately estimate. While military deaths are invariably put at between 2.5 million and 3.5 million, civilian death tolls vary from 750,000 to 3 million. Thus estimates of total dead, both military and civilian, range from 3,250,000 to 6,500,000.\n\n"}

Frank Baum. Originally published in 1899 as A New Wonderland, Being the First Account Ever Printed of the Beautiful Valley, and the Wonderful Adventures of Its Inhabitants, the book was reissued in 1903 with a new title in order to capitalize upon the alliterative title of Baum's successful \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\". The book is only slightly altered—Mo is called Phunniland or Phunnyland, but aside from the last paragraph of the first chapter, they are essentially the same book. It is illustrated by Frank Ver Beck.\n\n\"Mo\" is much more of a nonsense book than \"Oz\", bringing to mind Lewis Carroll's 1865 book \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", which is probably what the original title referred to.\n\nEach chapter is a different story, unlike Baum's other books, which are full-length stories. They do, however have a general throughline, and can be seen as an episodic novel.\n\nChapter One has no plot, but rather is a basic description of the Land of Mo, or \"The Beautiful Valley\". It explains that everyone in Mo is happy, and that the people never need to work, because everything they could desire grows on the trees, including items such as clothes. In \"A New Wonderland\", the author mentions planning to move there himself, but this was omitted from subsequent editions.\nChapter Two: The Monarch of Mo goes to fight the Purple Dragon, which has just eaten all of the caramels in the land. The Dragon bites off his head, and the King is forced to go home headless. The King tries to make the best of it, but the Queen complains that she cannot kiss him anymore, so he issues an edict saying that whoever can make him a new head will get to marry one of the princesses. After two failures, a durable head is made out of wood by a wood-chopper. The Purple Dragon finds the wood-chopper and bites his head off, replacing it with the King's head. When the wood-chopper appears in court, he switches heads with the King, so that the King has his own head again and the wood-chopper has a wooden head he made. The King then tries to fulfill his promise, but the princesses refuse to marry a wooden-headed man. The wood-chopper then confronts the Purple Dragon, who tries its head-biting technique again, only to get its teeth stuck in the wooden head, thus letting the wood-chopper get his own head back so he can marry a princess.\n\nChapter Three: The Monarch meets a dog, who is a curiosity because there are no dogs in Mo. However, his majesty loses his temper and ends up kicking the dog who literally gets bent out of shape until he resumes his natural form again.\n\nChapter Four: Prince Zingle, the oldest Prince, is upset because the King will not let him milk the Ice-Cream Cow. Urged by the Purple Dragon, Zingle pushes his father down a large hole so he will become the King. The Monarch escapes from the hole and punishes Zingle by abandoning him on the Fruit Cake Island on the Rootbeer River, an island made of fruit cake. After a while, Prince Zingle gets such a furious stomachache from eating nothing but fruit cake that he repents.\n\nChapter Five: The King celebrates his birthday (which he does several times a year) by throwing a huge celebration, during which he entertains everyone with items from a magical casket. Everyone goes ice-skating on a lake of sugar-syrup. The sugar cracks and Princess Truella, Prince Jollikin and Nuphsed sink to the bottom. The King gets them out by fishing for them, baiting the line with a kiss for Truella and a laugh for Jollikin. But when it comes to getting Nuphsed, no one knows what he likes best, so they consult the Wise Donkey. The Wise Donkey suggests that they use an apple, knowing that it won't work. When it doesn't work, the Wise Donkey eats the apple and tells them to use a kind word. They do, and it works.\n\nChapter Six: King Scowleyow, who lives in a nearby country, hates the people of Mo, and has his people build a giant man out of cast iron, designed to destroy Mo. They wind up the Cast-iron man and he walks towards Mo, but trips on the dog. Prince Thinkabit figures out how to get rid of the Cast-iron Man: he tickles the Cast-iron man to get him on his back, then he pushes a pin in the Cast-iron Man to get him to stand up again, but now the Cast-iron Man is facing the other way, so he goes to King Scowleyow's kingdom and destroys it instead. The Cast-iron man eventually gets stuck in the mud at the bottom of the ocean and is never heard from again.\n\nChapter Seven: A boy named Timtom falls in love with Princess Pattycake, the most beautiful princess, who unfortunately has a bad temper and tries to beat anyone who talks to her. He journeys to see the Sorceress Maëtta to get her help, and along the way, he meets three animals, who agree to help him in return for gifts from Maëtta. Timtom gets a pill for getting rid of Pattycake's temper and the gifts for the animals, but they are stolen by a Sly Fox. Timtom manages to recover the gifts, thus pleasing the animals. He then goes to Pattycake and feeds her the pill. She loses her temper and then agrees to marry him.\n\nChapter Eight: A horrible monster called a gigaboo comes to Mo and starts destroying things. Prince Jollikin fights the gigaboo, and has his head, arms and legs cut off. Prince Jollikin manages to put himself back together, although at first he could only find his legs and head. He then saves the day by killing the gigaboo.\n\nChapter Nine: There is an evil wizard in Mo who is a midget and very sensitive about his height, so he tries to make a potion to increase his height. One of the ingredients of the potion is the big toe of a princess, so he steals the toe from Princess Truella. Truella gives chase, overcoming the obstacles the Wizard throws at her, and eventually kills the Wizard and recovers her toe.\n\nChapter Ten: The Duchess Bredenbutta falls asleep on her boat while it floats down the Rootbeer River, and so she gets too close to the waterfall at the end of the river and falls down. She ends up in Turvyland, where everything is opposite of the way it should be. With some help from a local named Upsydoun, she manages to get back to her home.\n\nChapter Eleven: The King's animal crackers, which are real animals, fight amongst each other, putting the King in a bad mood, so when Prince Fiddlecumdoo asks to leave Mo, the King consents, although it is a bad idea. Prince Fiddlecumdoo leaves and meets a friendly giant named Hartilaf. Hartilaf's wife accidentally runs the prince through a clothes-wringer, and Prince Fiddlecumdoo returns home, completely flat. They use an air pump to get him back to normal.\n\nChapter Twelve: This chapter anticipates the novel \"Planet of the Apes\" by more than sixty years. Prince Zingle builds a large kite, which flies into the air, taking Zingle with it, eventually landing in the Land of the Civilized Monkeys, where monkeys act like humans. The monkeys do not speak English (but rather, they speak Monkey) and have never seen a human before, so they think Zingle is a dangerous animal and lock him in the zoo, where all of the monkeys come to see him, including two professors who believe that Zingle may be the missing link. Prince Zingle manages to escape and get back home.\n\nChapter Thirteen: The King's plum-pudding has been stolen, so he asks his wise men who did it. The wise men blame the fox, who is captured. The fox explains that he did not do it, as he was busy curing his family's sore throats by taking out the throats and turning them inside-out, then drying them in the sun. The wise men then blame the bullfrog, who is also captured. The bullfrog explains that he did not do it, as he and his wife were busy trying to save their tadpoles, who were eaten by a large fish. The wise men then blame the Yellow Hen, who is also captured. She explains that she did not do it, as her last batch of eggs accidentally produced a Hawk, not a chicken, and the Hawk took her away to a different country, and she spent the last nine days returning to Mo. The King, furious at the wise men for being wrong three times, has them put into a meat-grinder, so that they are mixed into one wise man, who tells the King that the Purple Dragon stole the plum-pudding.\n\nChapter Fourteen: The King holds a council of war to try to figure out how to destroy the Purple Dragon. They decide that the dragon cannot be destroyed, but at least they could rip out its teeth and make it harmless. They build a giant pair of forceps and clamp it to one of the Purple Dragon's teeth. The Purple Dragon winds its tail around a pillar to avoid being pulled by the people. As it turns out, his tooth cannot be removed, even though the men run to the other side of the valley; instead, the Purple Dragon is stretched all the way across the valley, so that it is no thicker than a fiddle-string. Prince Fiddlecumdoo cuts the Purple Dragon into fiddle-strings, and so the Valley of Mo is freed from its worst enemy.\n\n\nSome of the characters in the Oz books are or appear to be derived from characters in The Magical Monarch of Mo, such as:\n\n\nPart of \"The Scarecrow of Oz\" takes place in Mo, although none of the characters from \"The Magical Monarch of Mo\" appear in that book.

Many Cajuns use the word in regard to themselves.\n\nSocioeconomic factors appear to influence how Cajuns are likely to view the term: working-class Cajuns tend to regard the word \"coonass\" as a badge of ethnic pride, whereas middle- and upper-class Cajuns are more likely to regard the term as insulting or degrading, even when used by fellow Cajuns in reference to themselves. (In sociolinguistics, this type of behavior is termed covert prestige.) Despite an effort by Cajun activists to stamp out the term, it can be found on T-shirts, hats, and bumper stickers throughout Acadiana, the 22-parish Cajun homeland in south Louisiana. The term is also used by some of Cajun descent in nearby East Texas and Mississippi.\n\nThe origins of \"coonass\" are obscure, and Cajuns have put forth several folk etymologies in an effort to explain the word's origin. Some of these hold that the word refers to the Cajuns' occasional habit of eating raccoons, or from the use of coonskin caps by the Cajuns' ancestors while fighting in the Battle of New Orleans or in the Revolutionary War under Spanish colonial Governor Bernardo de Gálvez. Another folk etymology attributes the term to the racial slur \"coon,\" used in reference to African-Americans — thus implying that Cajuns are lower than African-Americans in social standing. Another holds that the term derives from the shape of a woman after having children (like a raccoon viewed from above). And yet another folk etymology maintains that \"coonass\" is a corruption of the French and Latin word \"cunnus\", a vulgar term for \"vulva\".\n\nThe most popular folk etymology, however, stems from late Louisiana congressman and cultural activist James \"Jimmy\" Domengeaux, who maintained that \"coonass\" derived from the continental French word \"connasse\". According to the French Wiktionary, the French Larousse dictionary, and the , \"connasse\" entered the French language at the beginning of the 19th century and the term translates loosely to \"dirty prostitute\". Domengeaux asserted that Frenchmen used the term in reference to Cajun soldiers serving in France during World War II, and that Anglo-American soldiers overheard the term, transformed it into \"coonass\" and brought it back to the US as a disparaging term for Cajuns. Citing Domengeaux's etymology, Louisiana legislators passed a concurrent resolution in the 1980s condemning the word. Contrary to popular belief, the lawmakers did not ban the term. Research has since disproved Domengeaux's \"connasse\" etymology. Indeed, photographic evidence shows that Cajuns themselves used the term prior to the time in which \"connasse\" allegedly morphed into \"coonass\".\n\n"}

It is the state's oldest church camp and is also the largest youth encampment in the United States. While the center primarily serves members of the Baptist faith, attendees from other denominations use the facility as well. Falls Creek is owned and operated by the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma (BGCO).\n\nFalls Creek was established in the summer of 1917, when J.B. Rounds and W. D. Moorer used donated land to host the meeting of the Baptist Young People's Union, with a total of 273 campers. Since then, Falls Creek has grown astronomically, now averaging 55,000 attendees each summer. In the 1920s, a large outdoor tabernacle was built and remained in use for many years. In 2004, this tabernacle was torn down and construction began on a new one, with services during the 2005 and 2006 sessions being held at an amphitheater. Benches from the old tabernacle, which had been signed by generations of campers, were sold as collector's items. In 2007, the new tabernacle was opened at the 90th Falls Creek session and was the first facility indoors and with rest rooms. Former Rep. and now US Senator James Lankford (R-OK) was Program Director for Falls Creek between 1996 and 2009.\n\nFalls Creek emanates from springs of the Arbuckle aquifer and flows over several waterfalls, the most notable being Price Falls, before dumping into the Washita River. The geologic formations surrounding Falls Creek have been dated to the Ordovician and contain many fossils of organisms that lived during that time. A large graben is present in the camp which contains the clastic materials of the Royer Dolomite which underwent karsting and was redeposited during the Pennsylvanian as the Collins Ranch Conglomerate.\n\nSince 1947, Falls Creek has hosted a special annual gathering, called \"Indian Falls Creek\", of Native American Christians from Christian churches of all denominations across and outside of the United States, and from many churches residing within the state of Oklahoma. This weeklong camp session, which is the largest Indigenous Christian camp in North America, is aimed at families and focuses on topics and activities of particular interest to the various tribes, such as native crafts and language preservation through songs. It is chaired and directed by Native American pastors Bill Barnett and Victor Cope. An annual blood drive and bone marrow registry are also held at this time to increase contributions and minority representation to the repository to provide better matches for those in need, with the blood being stored at the Oklahoma Blood Institute.\n\nMajor League Baseball umpires Ted Barrett and Rob Drake, together with Reverend Dean Esskew, founded \"Calling for Christ\", an organization ministering to professional umpires. In 2001, Barrett and Drake were introduced to Esskew at a conference in Denver where Esskew told them about Falls Creek's facilities. They decided\nto hold their first retreat at Falls Creek and have returned for several years.\n\nIn August 2010, a 20-year-old camper from Wichita, Kansas named Moses Fitchpatrick broke off from his hiking group and went missing. His body was found several days later, two miles south of the Falls Creek property, in rough terrain. The cause of death was undetermined, but likely to have been a result of heat and dehydration.\n\nFalls Creek is considered to be in Davis, Oklahoma for official matters, but many locals and attendees consider it to be an independent township or self-running town, complete with a post office and shops. It also has a lake and a natural spring.\n\nFalls Creek is an unincorporated community in Murray county in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.\n\nFalls Creek is the home of Falls Creek Baptist Conference Center. The former B. B. McKinney Chapel in Falls Creek was named in honor of Baylus Benjamin McKinney, the Louisiana native and Christian singer and composer of 149 gospel hymns. It was demolished in 2003-2004 for the construction of the new R.A. Young Tabernacle.\n\nMajor highways are:\n\n\n"}

He helped establish the collective, originally in Sydney, including the Clan Analogue record label and organising performance events. During this period the label released vinyl extended plays, a compilation CD (\"Cog\") and cassette tapes. Naomi Mapstone of \"The Canberra Times\" reviewed the fourth EP, which \"features live, acts from Canberra and Sydney, playing rave, industrial, garage and hardcore.\"\n\nClan Analogue signed a distribution agreement with Mushroom Records' Mushroom Distribution Services by 1994. In its early years the record label published a newsletter, \"Kronic Oscillator\", and hosted stages at two consecutive Big Day Out festivals. They established a regular club night, \"Electronic\", at the Bentley Bar in Sydney.\n\nIn the early years of Clan Analogue membership attracted individuals who were interested and active in electronic sound in Australia, including Palmer, Tobias Kazumichi Grime, Antony Bannister, Sharif Hansa, Garry Bradbury (Severed Heads, Size), George Soropos, Scot Art, Chris Bell, Bo Daley (Dark Network), Rosie X (Geekgirl), Nick Wilson, Jasper Russell, Seb Chan, Luke Dearnley (Bass Snarl), Andy Fitzgerald, Ali Omar (Atone), Adrian Black, Lisa Bode, James McParlane, Jamie Stevens, Benj Askins (Infusion), Kate Crawford, Nicole Skeltys (), Gordon Finlayson, Ian Andrews (Disco Stu), Mark Ireland (Carrier), Cindi Drennan, Justin Maynard (Tesseract), Grant Muir (VJ Morph), Roslyn McGinty (Bass Bitch), Elle Stearn (Lush Puppy), Marty Wells (Batfreak), Murray Creagh.\n\nThe collective's appeal was largely fueled by the sore lack of live venues in Australia for electronic music and a lack of options for releasing recorded material. On 25 March 1994 a live performance at the Goethe Institut, Sydney, was recorded for a video album, \"Clan Analogue Live\" (1994), with Palmer as producer.\n\nFollowing Brendan's departure from the collective in 1995 to start Zonar Records, journalist, DJ and lawyer Gordon Finlayson took over as label manager of the Clan Analogue record label and the collective established a decentralised system of operations with individuals such as Scot Art, Antony Bannister, lLisa Bode, Nick Wilson, Toby Grime, Mark Ireland, Chris Bell, Bo Daley, Rick Bull (Deep Child) and Charlotte Whittingham all taking roles in managing the ongoing operations of the collective. During this period the label's output including numerous thematic compilation CDs such as Cognition, Jaunt, 20 Disco Greats, Aphelion, Solid Gold and Pre-Sense as well as solo releases from artists such as Deep Child, The Telemetry Orchestra, Nerve Agent, The 5000 Fingers of Dr T, Disco Stu, Atone and Dark Network.\n\nIn 2001 Melbourne based Nick Wilson took over the management of the Clan Analogue record label and remains the label manager until the present date. During that period Clan Analogue has continued to maintain an extensive release schedule of CDs, LPs and digital downloads with notable solo artist releases from Bleepin' J. Squawkins, Valley Forge, Winduptoys, Lunar Module and Dsico and critically acclaimed compilations such as 'Headspace: A Tribute to Severed Heads' and 'Re Cognition: The Clan Analogue Legacy Collection' released on the 20th anniversary of the formation of the collective.\n\nClan Analogue quickly established itself as the pioneer of electronic art in Australia, publishing EPs, LPs, CDs, Videos, DVDs, Web sites and digital downloads while also organising and promoting live electronic music. Clan Analogue and its members have also hosted various radio programs on 2SER (Electroplastique), 2MBS (The Transcendental Anaesthetic), 2RSR, FBI and RRR.\n\nFrom its start Clan Analogue promoted the live electronic music and video art with events held in The Goethe Institute, The Art gallery of NSW and The Museum Of Contemporary Art. Starting with small club nights, Clan soon started hosting parties that attracted hundreds and then thousands of patrons, including the pioneering club night 'Electronic', stages at festivals such as The Big Day Out and Freaky Loops and one off events like Crunch, Transdimensional Vehicle (with psychedelic philosopher Terrence McKenna) and Thank God It's Friday.\n\nClan Analogue was one part of a wider, thriving electronic music scene in the 90s & 00s in Australia alongside other underground electronic collectives and crews such as the Vibe Tribe, Frigid, Punos, Club Kooky and Elefant Traks.\n\nSince its inception, Clan Analogue has released over 30 albums directly with many more releases coming from collective members such as Deep Child, , Disco Stu, Artificial, Dark Network, Atone, Lunar Module, Carrier and Telemetry Orchestra through other labels.

It is run by School District 43 Coquitlam. Gleneagle serves grades 9-12 and has an enrolment of about 1500 students. In addition to academic programs, Gleneagle offers specialty programs such as ACE-IT Culinary Arts and Hairdressing, the COAST outdoor education program, the grade 9 JumpstART art program, and the school district's TALONS gifted program.\n\nAs of the 2013-14 school year Gleneagle ranked 80 out of 293 by the Fraser Institute with a rating of 7.1, down from previous years. Gleneagle has one of the highest rates of student acceptance to post secondary education among BC's high schools, with more than 50% of graduates entering a Public Post-Secondary Institution in British Columbia.\n\nGleneagle's Model United Nations team is particularly successful, with 75% of its participants winning awards at the Canadian International Model United Nations 2012. Gleneagle student Kasra Vahidi won a competition gold medal in architecture at the Skills Canada B.C. competition in April 2012. Vahidi subsequently competed in the Canadian National Competition in May 2012 in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\n\nThe site for Gleneagle had been set aside for more than 15 years and the school had been expected to open in 1993, yet had been postponed for several years due to funding shortfalls. In 1995, for a second year in a row, provincial funds from the education ministry were not allocated for the $25 million construction, potentially resulting in 3000 high school students being relegated to portable classrooms within two years. Protests from local parents resulted in signs being affixed to the chain link fence surrounding the site and parents and children waving posters and placards at passing motorists on one of the busiest intersections serving Coquitlam's northwest neighborhoods. In October, 1995, a local parent group, P.E.A.C.E. (Parents Expecting Adequate Funding for Construction and Education), began selling imaginary bricks for $2 each in a fundraiser that was supported unanimously in a vote by the school board. By the end of 1995 they had raised over $10,000 towards the $25 million cost. The \"Buy a Brick - Build a School\" campaign resulted in funds being released in the 1996/97 capital budget for education in April 1996 with an announcement by Port Coquiltam MLA, Mike Farnsworth. Gleneagle Secondary School was officially opened on September 2, 1997 with 1200 students from grades 9 - 11.\n\nSeveral notable programs are offered that are either unique only to Gleneagle or only at select schools in the district.\n\nThe T.A.L.O.N.S. Program (\"The Academy of Learning for Outstanding Notable Students\") is a two-year program for gifted students in grades 9 and 10 focusing on interdisciplinary and autonomous learning. Application to the program is only available for district identified gifted students currently in grade 8 with application beginning in December of each year.\n\nJumpstART 9 is a thematic program integrating Humanities (English 9 and Social Studies 9) and the Fine Arts in a yearlong morning program.\n\nThe C.O.A.S.T Program (\"Coquitlam Outdoor Academic School Term\") consists of one semester of regular classes where students take Math, Science 10, and two electives. The secondary semester the students meet as a single group that study English 10, Social Studies 10 with integrated Field Studies, Planning 10 Online, Physical Education 10 and 11, and Leadership 11 while gaining certifications in St. John's First Aid, Flatwater Level One from the Recreational Canoeing Association of British Columbia, and Rock Climbing Belay. Students participate in various outings during the semester and on weekends including back country snowshoeing and camping, cross country skiing, rock climbing, mountain biking, kayaking, and canoeing.\n\nGleneagle offers two apprenticeship programs of technical training under the format of an ACE-IT program (Accelerated Credit Enrollment in Industry Training) in Cook Training and Hairdressing that provide Level I certification.\n\nIn conjunction with the Emily Carr University of Art and Design, Gleneagle functions as a satellite campus offering courses in Foundations courses.\n\nGleneagle produces a student-run newspaper known as The Edge. The newspaper is produced by the Journalism 11/12 class, and was founded in 1997. It has won a number of awards from the Quill and Scroll Society, such as the International First Place Award and the George H. Gallup Award. The most recent award received was the 2014 International First Place Award.\n\nMost core courses are available, especially those required for graduation. Students may take up to two courses with a refundable deposit of $100 each. Courses can be face-to-face or a combination of online and traditional learning (FastTrack). In 2015 it was reported that 1400 students were enrolled for the summer session, a higher density than the 2014/15 10-month school year.\n\nGleneagle has a music and theatre program that have won several awards and put on several performance throughout the year.\n\nBroken Wing Theatre was the name given to the theatre program at Gleneagle by Richard Dixon. The school has presented more than 300 scripted plays and musicals since it opened in 1997. In addition to a number of plays performed by acting classes, extracurricular plays are presented in the fall and spring; as well as the annual school musical also presented in the spring. Broken Wing Theatre often practiced Black Box Theatre with minimal basic sets, music, and lighting for the acting classes, so as to speed up the rate of production and to focus resources on actor training and learning by participating, rather than reading about it or spending time creating sets. The use of scripts is a constant in Broken Wing Theatre's approach to acting: at any given point, all actors in the program are either rehearsing or performing scripted plays, musicals, scenes, or monologues.\n\nThe theatre at Gleneagle is no longer known as Broken Wing Theatre, since Richard Dixon retired in 2009 and was succeeded by Ashley Freeborn. Freeborn's productions drifted far from the black box theatre approach and Gleneagle is now known for its set design and visually appealing big productions. Freeborn was succeeded in 2015 by Amy Clausen, who took over during the pre production of Beauty and the Beast (2016.) Clausen was succeeded by Zelda Coertze after the auditions for Sister Act in 2017. Coertze was succeeded in 2018 by Justin Maller at the start of the 2018-2019 school year. Notable productions of the past include: The Grapes of Wrath (play), Parfumerie (play), The Actor's Nightmare (play), The Wizard Of Oz, Seussical (musical), Thoroughly Modern Millie, Footloose, Shrek the Musical, Beauty and the Beast, Guys and Dolls, Sister Act, West Side Story as well as a number of student-written and director-written/adapted plays. Notable alumni of the theatre program at Gleneagle Secondary have gone on to attend widely well-regarded theatre schools all around the world such as Studio 58 in Vancouver, Randolph Academy in Toronto, and Circle In The Square Theatre School in New York City.\n\nGleneagle's athletic program has resulted in over 150 championships with 110 Coquitlam District Championships, 26 Fraser Valley Championships, 16 Provincial Championships, and the first school in District 43 to win the BC School Sports Outstanding School Achievement Award from BC School Sports in 2005.\n\n\n"}

He was the son of Hugh III of Baux, Viscount of Marseilles, and Barrale.\n\nBarral came to oppose the Albigensian Crusade, and invaded the Comtat Venaissin in 1234 in support of Raymond VII of Toulouse.\n\nIn 1239, Barral entered negotiations to have his daughter Cecile marry Guigues VII, Dauphin of Viennois, another supporter of Toulouse. Under pressure from Philip of Savoy, Barral reneged on the engagement, saying he had only agreed to it in fear of his life. In 1244, Barral helped arbitrate the latest conflict between Savoy and Provence on one side and the dauphin and Aymar III of Valentinois on the other. In December of that year, Cecile married the Count of Savoy, firmly pulling Baux into the Savoy alliances.\n\nIn 1246, Barral joined his son-in-law and family in bringing an army to the rescue of Beatrice of Savoy and her daughter Beatrice of Provence, who had recently inherited the county of Provence. They had been besieged by others seeking to marry her, but the family was able to safely escort her to her wedding. The countess's new husband did not respect her father's will toward the rest of the family, so Barral joined the Provençal rebellion against Charles of Anjou in 1247, supporting his son-in-law's family in their rights. Forced to surrender to Charles in June 1251, he became a supporter of Charles by October, and helped suppress the rebellion in 1262.\n\nIn 1255, Barral was again called on to mediate the disputes between Philip of Savoy and the Valentinois-Viennois alliance.\n\nFor his support of Charles, he was made Grand Justiciar of Sicily, and died in 1268. He was succeeded as Lord of Baux by his son Bertran.\n\nHe married Sibylle d'Anduze (died after 9 June 1279), the daughter of Constance of Toulouse and Pierre Bermond, seigneur d'Anduze.

The 1928 first edition thereof is considered the first elementary text clearly grounded in the formalism now known as first-order logic (FOL). Hilbert and Ackermann also formalized FOL in a way that subsequently achieved canonical status. FOL is now a core formalism of mathematical logic, and is presupposed by contemporary treatments of Peano arithmetic and nearly all treatments of axiomatic set theory.\n\nThe 1928 edition included a clear statement of the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) for FOL, and also asked whether that logic was complete (i.e., whether all semantic truths of FOL were theorems derivable from the FOL axioms and rules). The former problem was answered in the negative first by Alonzo Church and independently by Alan Turing in 1936. The latter was answered affirmatively by Kurt Gödel in 1929.\n\nIn its description of set theory, mention is made of Russell's paradox and the Liar paradox (page 145). Contemporary notation for logic owes more to this text than it does to the notation of \"Principia Mathematica\", long popular in the English speaking world.\n\n"}

Little is known of his origins or his activities as archbishop, although a number of stories were told about his possible origins after the Norman conquest in 1066. There are no records of him prior to his becoming archbishop. He possibly owed his elevation to the Kentish monarch. The records after his elevation to Canterbury are mainly about disputes over land, but knowledge of his time in office is hampered by the destruction of many of the contemporary records. After his death, he was considered a saint and a life about him was written in the 12th century.\n\nVarious stories have been told about Bregowine's origins, including that he was a nobleman and a continental Saxon who converted to Christianity and came to Canterbury because of the saintly reputation of Theodore of Tarsus. Others say that he owed his elevation to King Æthelbert II of Kent, but all these stories rest on works that were written after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. There are no contemporary records of Bregowine before he was archbishop. It does not appear, however, that he was of Mercian origins like his predecessors Tatwin and Nothhelm.\n\nWhatever his upbringing, Bregowine was consecrated as archbishop on 27 September 761. His election took place in a brief period when Kent was free of Mercian dominance between 756 and 764, so the story that he owed his election to Æthelbert does fit with the time frame. He wrote letters to Archbishop Lul of Mainz which still exist, and which discuss an earlier meeting between the two men. Other activities as archbishop are recorded in surviving charters. One records that he protested at the loss of a church at Cookham that was confiscated by King Cynewulf of Wessex sometime after 760. Another surviving charter from Dunwald, a thegn of King Æthelbert, concerning land in Canterbury, records that Bregowine consented to the gift of land. Unfortunately, many of the early charters of the diocese of Canterbury are lost, which restricts knowledge of Bregowine's activities as archbishop.\n\nBregowine died in 764 and was originally buried in the baptistry in Canterbury, but his remains were moved to the choir of Canterbury Cathedral in 1123. This followed an attempt in around 1121 to remove his remains to another monastery, which came to nothing. The remains were placed by the altar of St Gregory in the south transept, after having been briefly placed in the north transept. Bregowine was later considered a saint, with a feast day of 26 August, although Florence of Worcester, a 12th-century writer, recorded his death date as 24 August. Other sources record the death date as 25 August. His life was later written by Eadmer in the 12th century.\n"}

He has written five novels about terrorism and Bible prophecy, including the Gold Medallion Book Award-winner \"The Ezekiel Option.\" He also has written two nonfiction books, \"Epicenter\" and \".\"\n\nRosenberg was born in 1967 near Rochester, New York. He has stated that his father is of Jewish descent and his mother was born into a Methodist family of English descent. His parents were agnostic and became born-again Christians when he was a child in 1973. At the age of 17, he became a born-again Christian and now identifies as a Jewish believer in Jesus. He graduated in 1988 from Syracuse University, after which he worked for Rush Limbaugh as a research assistant. Later, he worked for U.S. presidential candidate Steve Forbes as a campaign advisor. Rosenberg opened a political consultancy business which he ran until 2000, and claims to have consulted for former Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Natan Sharansky and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, where he says that he garnered much of his information on the Middle East that he uses in his books.\n\nFollowing Netanyahu's loss in 1999, Rosenberg decided to retire from politics and begin a new career in writing. \"The Last Jihad\" was both his first book and the first of a five-part fictional series involving terrorism and how it may relate to Bible Prophecy. The book was written nine months before the September 11th attacks (a revised edition takes the event into account) and was published in 2002. When published, \"The Last Jihad\" spent 11 weeks on the \"New York Times\" best-seller list, reaching as high as number seven. It also appeared on the \"USA Today\" and \"Publishers Weekly\" best-seller lists, and hit number four on the \"Wall Street Journal\" list. The book was followed by \"The Last Days\", which spent four weeks on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller List, hit number five on the \"Denver Post\" list, and hit number eight on the \"Dallas Morning News\" list. Following the successes of his first two novels, \"The Ezekiel Option\" was published in 2005, \"The Copper Scroll\" in 2006, and the final book \"Dead Heat\" in 2008.\n\nRosenberg also wrote a non-fictional account of current events and Bible Prophecy in the book \"Epicenter\". It was published in September 2006 and an accompanying DVD was produced in the summer of 2007. His second non-fiction book \"Inside the Revolution\" addresses the different sects of Islam in the Middle East and asserts that a significant number of moderate Muslims are converting to Christianity in the region. It was released in 2009 and also made it onto the \"New York Times\" best-seller list, reaching as high as #7 as of 27 March 2009. His 2011 book \"The Twelfth Imam\" also deals with terrorism and Iran gaining nuclear power.\n\nRosenberg is the founder and President of The Joshua Fund, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit charity that seeks to \"Bless Israel and her neighbors in the name of Jesus, according to Genesis 12:1-3.\"\n\nMedia Matters for America, a progressive media watchdog group, criticized Rosenberg's July 31, 2006, \"Paula Zahn Now\", CNN appearance that \"featured a segment on 'whether the crisis in the Middle East is actually a prelude to the end of the world,' marking the third time in eight days that CNN has devoted airtime to those claiming that the ongoing Mideast violence signals the coming of the Apocalypse.\" It featured Rosenberg comparing apocalyptic Scripture in the Bible to modern events, which he views, in addition to the lenses of politics and economics, through what he calls \"a third lens as well: the lens of Scripture.\"\n\nRosenberg's views on the War of Ezekiel 38–39 involving Gog and Magog are in line with dispensationalism, one of several Christian theological systems involving eschatology.

{"id": "2134058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2134058", "title": "Subfornical organ", "text": "Subfornical organ\n\nThe subfornical organ (SFO) is one of the circumventricular organs of the brain. Its name comes from its location on the ventral surface of the fornix near the interventricular foramina (foramina of Monro), which interconnect the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle. Like all circumventricular organs, the subfornical organ is well-vascularized, and like all circumventricular organs except the subcommissural organ, some SFO capillaries have fenestrations, which increase capillary permeability. The SFO is considered a sensory circumventricular organ because it is responsive to a wide variety of hormones and neurotransmitters, as opposed to secretory circumventricular organs, which are specialized in the release of certain substances.\n\nAs noted above, capillaries in some subregions within the SFO are fenestrated, and thus lack a blood-brain barrier. All circumventricular organs except the subcommissural organ contain fenestrated capillaries, a feature that distinguishes them from most other parts of the brain. The SFO can be divided into six anatomical zones based on its capillary topography: two zones in the coronal plane and four zones in the sagittal plane. The central zone is composed of the glial cells, neuronal cell bodies and a high density of fenestrated capillaries. Conversely, the rostral and caudal areas have a lower density of capillaries and are mostly made of nerve fibers, with fewer neurons and glial cells seen in this area. Functionally, however, the SFO may be viewed in two portions, the dorsolateral peripheral division, and the ventromedial core segment.\n\nThe subfornical organ contains endothelin receptors mediating vasoconstriction and high rates of glucose metabolism mediated by calcium channels.\n\nThe subfornical organ is active in many bodily processes, including osmoregulation, cardiovascular regulation, and energy homeostasis. Most of these processes involve fluid balance through the control of the release of certain hormones, particularly angiotensin or vasopressin.\n\nThe impact of the SFO on the cardiovascular system is mostly mediated through its influence on fluid balance. The SFO plays a role in vasopressin regulation. Vasopressin is a hormone that, when bound to receptors in the kidneys, increases water retention by decreasing the amount of fluid transferred from blood to urine by the kidneys. This regulation of blood volume affects other aspects of the cardiovascular system. Increased or decreased blood volume influences blood pressure, which is regulated by baroreceptors, and can in turn affect the strength of ventricular contraction in the heart. Additional research has demonstrated that the subfornical organ may be an important intermediary through which leptin acts to maintain blood pressure within normal physiological limits via descending autonomic pathways associated with cardiovascular control.\n\nSFO neurons have also been experimentally shown to send efferent projections to regions involved in cardiovascular regulation including the lateral hypothalamus, with fibers terminating in the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei, and the anteroventral 3rd ventricle (AV3V) with fibers terminating in the OVLT and the median preoptic area.\n\nOther circumventricular organs participating in systemic regulatory processes are the area postrema and the OVLT. The OVLT and SFO are both interconnected with the nucleus medianus, and together these three structures comprise the so-called \"AV3V\" region – the region anterior and ventral to the third ventricle. The AV3V region is important in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance, by controlling thirst, sodium excretion, blood volume regulation, and vasopressin secretion. The SFO, area postrema, and OVLT have capillaries permeable to circulating hormonal signals, enabling these three circumventricular organs to have integrative roles in cardiovascular, electrolyte, and fluid regulation.\n\nNeurons in the subfornical organ have receptors for many hormones that circulate in the blood but which do not cross the blood–brain barrier, including angiotensin, atrial natriuretic peptide, endothelin and relaxin. The role of the SFO in angiotensin regulation is particularly important, as it is involved in communication with the nucleus medianus (also called the median preoptic nucleus). Some neurons in the SFO are osmoreceptors, being sensitive to the osmotic pressure of the blood. These neurons project to the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus to regulate the activity of vasopressin-secreting neurons. These neurons also project to the nucleus medianus which is involved in controlling thirst. Thus, the subfornical organ is involved in fluid balance.\n\nOther important hormones have been shown to excite the SFO, specifically serotonin, carbamylcholine (carbachol), and atropine. These neurotransmitters however seem to have an effect on deeper areas of the SFO than angiotensin, and antagonists of these hormones have been shown to also primarily effect the non-superficial regions of the SFO (other than atropine antagonists, which showed little effects). In this context, the superficial region is considered to be 15-55μm deep into the SFO, and the \"deep\" region anything below that.\n\nFrom these reactions to certain hormones and other molecules, a model of the neuronal organization of the SFO is suggested in which angiotensin-sensitive neurons lying superficially are excited by substances borne by blood or cerebrospinal fluid, and synapse with deeper carbachol-sensitive neurons. The axons of these deep neurons pass out of the SFO in the columns and body of the fornix. Afferent fibers from the body and columns of the fornix polysynaptically excite both superficial and deep neurons. A recurrent inhibitory circuit is suggested on the output path.\n\nThe expression of various genes in the subfornical organ have been studied. For example, it was seen that water deprivation in rats led to an upregulation of the mRNA that codes for angiotensin II receptors, allowing for a lower angiotensin concentration in the blood that produce the \"thirst\" response. It also has been observed to be a site of thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) production, a protein generally produced in the hypothalamus.\n\nHypertension, or high blood pressure, is highly affected by the concentration of angiotensin. Injection of angiontensin has actually been long used to induce hypertension in animal test models to study the effects of various therapies and medications. In such experiments, it has been observed that an intact and functioning subfornical organ limits the increase in mean arterial pressure due to the increased angiotensin.\n\nAs stated above, angiotensin receptors (AT1) have been shown to be upregulated due to water deprivation. These AT1 receptors have also shown an increased bonding with circulating angiotensin after water deprivation. These findings could indicate some sort of morphological change in the AT1 receptor, likely due to some signal protein modification of the AT1 receptor at a non-bonding site, leading to an increased affinity of the AT1 receptor for angiotensin bonding.\n\nAlthough generally viewed primarily as having roles in homeostasis and cardiovascular regulation, the subfornical organ has been thought to control feeding patterns through taking inputs from the blood (various peptides indicating satiety) and then stimulating hunger. It has been shown to induce drinking in rats as well as eating.\n"}

He is notable for having founded The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States in 1859. By the time of Hyde's death, The Equitable was the largest life insurance company in the world.\n\nHyde was born in Catskill, New York on February 15, 1834, the son of Henry Hazen Hyde (1805–1873), a successful merchant, and Lucy Baldwin (née Beach) Hyde (1807–1846). He attended the public schools of Catskill, and when he was 16 his teacher decided to move to New York City to join the growing life insurance industry. The teacher persuaded both Hydes to join him, and all three became agents for the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York.\n\nThe younger Hyde worked for several months in Honesdale, Pennsylvania before deciding to return to New York City, where he became a clerk for Merritt, Ely & Company, a dry goods import and wholesale company. He remained there for two years, and then returned to Mutual Life, where his father had recently been appointed to the executive ranks and a place on the board of directors. Hyde rose through the home office staff to become the company's cashier.\n\nIn March 1859, Hyde left Mutual Life and established his own company, Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States. William C. Alexander initially served as president, and Hyde was vice president and general manager. Hyde succeeded to the presidency after Alexander's death in 1874, and remained in the position until his death.\n\nHe led the company to construct the Equitable Life Assurance Building for its headquarters, completed on May 1, 1870, and pushed to have the first passenger elevators installed in what was then the tallest office building in the United States.\n\nIn 1864, he was married to Annie Fitch (1845–1922), a daughter of Capt. Martin Halenbeck Truesdell and Jane Maria (née Reed) Fitch.

He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. His widow died in 1922.\n\nHyde sought to guarantee that his son James Hazen Hyde would continue the family’s control of the company after his death. The younger Hyde was appointed a vice president of the company at 22, and was 23 when he inherited a majority interest in the company. By the terms of his father's will, he was scheduled to assume the company presidency in 1906, but a concerted effort against him by the current president and several members of the board of directors led James H. Hyde to leave the company and move to France.\n\nThrough his son, he was a grandfather of Henry Baldwin Hyde (1915–1997), who married Marie de La Grange, a daughter of Baron Amaury De La Grange and Emily Eleanor, Baroness De La Grange (daughter of Henry T. Sloane), in 1941. Marie's brother was Henry-Louis de La Grange, a musicologist and biographer of Gustav Mahler.\n\n"}

Its robustness contrasts with the instability of chloric acid and bromic acid. Iodic acid features iodine in the oxidation state +5 and is one of the most stable oxo-acids of the halogens. When heated, samples dehydrate to give iodine pentoxide. On further heating, the iodine pentoxide further decomposes, giving a mix of iodine, oxygen and lower oxides of iodine.\n\nIodic acid can be produced by oxidizing iodine I with strong oxidizers such as nitric acid , chlorine , chloric acid or hydrogen peroxide , for example:\n\nIodic acid is a relatively strong acid with a p\"K\" of 0.75. It is strongly oxidizing in acidic solution, less so in basic solution. When iodic acid acts as oxidizer, then the product of the reaction is either iodine, or iodide ion. Under some special conditions (very low pH and high concentration of chloride ions, such as in concentrated hydrochloric acid), iodic acid is reduced to iodine trichloride, a golden yellow compound in solution and no further reduction occurs. In the absence of chloride ions, when there is an excess amount of reductant, then all iodate is converted to iodide ion. When there is an excess amount of iodate, then part of the iodate is converted to iodine. It may be used in preparation of ionization to form alkyl halides.\n\nIodic acid is used as a strong acid in analytical chemistry.

It was written by Minogue, Richard Stannard, Julian Gallagher, and Ash Howes, and produced by Stannard and Gallagher. It is a dance-pop song and talks about sexual temptation. Delayed from a January 2002 release, it was released as the second single from the album on 18 February 2002 by Parlophone, except in the United States, where the song was not released.\n\nCritical reception towards \"In Your Eyes\" was mostly positive, who commended the catchy chorus and the production, but many critics were reluctant in reviewing the song on the album. In Australia, the song debuted at number one was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). It reached number three in the United Kingdom, and was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The single also charted inside the top twenty in Finland, Hungary, Canada, and New Zealand.\n\nA music video for \"In Your Eyes\" was directed by Dawn Shadforth and was envisioned as a science fiction-extension from Minogue's previous single, \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" (2001). It features Minogue and numerous backup dancers, surrounded with LED lights. \"In Your Eyes\" was performed on her 2002 Fever Tour, and has appeared on most of her concert tours since, including the one-off concert show Money Can't Buy, and most recently in the Golden Tour in 2018.\n\nFollowing the success of Minogue's 2001 single, \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\", Minogue's label Parlophone were set to release the second single from the album \"Fever\" (2001). Minogue enlisted several writers and producers such as Richard Stannard, Julian Gallagher, and Ash Howes, all whom worked with Minogue on her seventh album, \"Light Years\" (2000). All four of them, including Minogue, wrote \"In Your Eyes\" together, while Stannard and Gallagher handled the production of the song. After the major success of \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\", it was announced that \"In Your Eyes\" would be released as the album's second official single, set for a January 2002 release. However, due to the overwhelming success and radio airplay in Europe, the single was postponed until February 2002.\n\nMusically, \"In Your Eyes\" is a dance-pop song, which features influences of nu-disco and Europop. In the first verse, her vocals span and range from F#m-D-D-C#-Bm. When it reaches the chorus, her vocals range from F#m-Bm-C#. The chords basically repeat with each verse it has. According to Popmatters and \"NME\", the described the song as \"another disco-sounding club track that lyrically propels Minogue further into a more sexual sound on the lyrics \"I want to make it with you.\" Ian Wade from Yahoo!

He said \"'In Your Eyes' which cheekily references comeback hit 'Spinning Around'.\"\n\nSal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called the song a \"contagious club hit waiting to infect\".\n\n\"In Your Eyes\" was released on 18 February 2002. It was originally scheduled for release in January, but was delayed because of the airplay popularity of \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\". It debuted at number three on the UK singles chart, becoming her twenty-second top-ten single. The song remained on the chart for seventeen weeks,three of which were in the top twenty. It was an airplay hit in the UK, where it reached number one. The song also peaked at number seven on the Club Chart.\n\nThe single became a hit elsewhere in Europe, reaching the top five in Croatia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia. \"In Your Eyes\" was released in Canada (where it peaked at number eleven) and Mexico, but not in the United States, where \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" had just been released.\n\nIn Australia, \"In Your Eyes\" was released as scheduled on 21 January 2002. The song was certified gold prior to its release on pre-sales only. It debuted at number one on the ARIA singles chart and became the fourth single by Minogue to reach the top position since 2000. It peaked at number 18 on Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ), and stayed on the charts for 18 weeks.\n\n\"In Your Eyes\" featured a music video that was directed by Dawn Shadforth. The video features Minogue in a studio filled with colourful neon lights. There are two sequences; the first features Minogue and a group of dancers in front of a colourful background, the second is simply Minogue spinning before a background of flashing lights.

Minogue and her artistic director William Baker had become interested in the street interpretation of robotic, jerky movements and included this in the video. The costumes also represent this interest and were described by Baker as being a mix of \"hip hop chic with sci-fi lunacy\".\n\nReleased to music video channels prior to the single's commercial release, the video was a hit, charting at number one on MTV's Hit List UK and at number four on MTV Europe's top twenty countdown. The video was first released commercially as a DVD single in Australia in 2002, but was also included on the \"Ultimate Kylie\" companion DVD, released in December 2004.\n\n\n\nThe song was first performed on \"An Audience With Kylie Minogue\"; \"In Your Eyes\" was then included in the \"Sex in Venice\" section of KylieFever2002, where it was performed as a medley with a Latin version of itself, \"Please Stay\" and a chorus of \"Rhythm of the Night\" The song was next performed in 2003 at Minogue's one-off, invitation-only gig Money Can't Buy to promote her ninth studio album \"Body Language\". It was featured in the third act \"Electro\". \"In Your Eyes\" was performed as the second song of the show in both the and tours, and was then remixed for inclusion on KylieX2008 and For You, For Me, where it was included in the first section of both shows; this version of the song was also included on the set list for Kylie Summer 2015. The song was performed on the in 2011 where it was performed in Japan only and as a request at a lot of dates; it was included in the rehearsal set list, after \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\", but was ultimately discarded from the main show. In 2018, the song was reworked and included in Minogue's headlining set for Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park, which was later included in Minogue's Golden Tour. This version of the song was combined with the version from KylieX2008, and was performed on Minogue's Summer 2019 tour.\n\nThe song was used in the 2020 thriller movie \"The Hater\", directed by Jan Komasa, in the gay club scene with Maciej Stuhr and Maciej Musiałowski.\n\n\nSource\n\n\n\n"}

The region mostly lies in the upper watershed of the Mahi River and its tributaries, which is said to be the lifeline of Vagad. The Mahi flows north through the district (Banswara) from its origin in the Vindhya Range of Madhya Pradesh, entering the district (Banswara) from the southeast and flowing north towards the northern end of the district, where it turns southwest to form the boundary between Banswara and Dungarpur districts before entering Gujarat and emptying into the Gulf of Cambay.\n\nVagad has rich flora and fauna. The forests include mainly teak. The wildlife includes a large variety of wild animals such as the leopard and the chinkara. Common birds in the region include fowl, partridge, black drongo, grey shrike, green bee-eater, bulbul and parrot. Some of the towns in this region are Aspur, Bhiluda, Simalwada, Sagwara, Partapur, Bagidra and Garhi.\n\nParmar rulers held Vagar during the 11th century with their political center at Arthuna (in present-day Banswara district).

Like all periodates it can exist in two forms: orthoperiodic acid, with the chemical formula HIO and metaperiodic acid, which has the formula HIO.\n\nPeriodic acid was discovered by Heinrich Gustav Magnus and C. F. Ammermüller in 1833.\n\nModern industrial scale production involves the oxidation of a solution of sodium iodate under alkaline conditions, either electrochemically on a PbO anode, or by treatment with chlorine:\n\nOrthoperiodic acid can be dehydrated to give metaperiodic acid by heating to 100 °C under reduced pressure.\n\nFurther heating to around 150 °C gives iodine pentoxide (IO) rather than the expected anhydride \"diiodine heptoxide\" (IO). Metaperiodic acid can also be prepared from various orthoperiodates by treatment with dilute nitric acid.\n\nOrthoperiodic acid has a number of acid dissociation constants. The pKa of metaperiodic acid has not been determined.\n\nThere being two forms of periodic acid, it follows that two types of periodate salts are formed. For example, sodium metaperiodate, NaIO, can be synthesised from HIO while sodium orthoperiodate, NaIO can be synthesised from HIO.\n\nOrthoperiodic acid forms monoclinic crystals (space group P2/\"\") consisting of a slightly deformed IO octahedron interlinked via bridging hydrogens. Five I-O bond distances are in the range 1.87-1.91 Å and one I-O bond is 1.78 Å.\nThe structure of metaperiodic acid also includes IO octahedra, however these are connected via \"cis\"-edge-sharing with bridging oxygens to form one-dimensional infinite chains.\n\nLike all periodates periodic acid can be used to cleave various 1,2-difunctional compounds. Most notably periodic acid will cleave vicinal diols into two aldehyde or ketone fragments (Malaprade reaction).\n\nThis can be useful in determining the structure of carbohydrates as periodic acid can be used to open saccharide rings. This process is often used in labeling saccharides with fluorescent molecules or other tags such as biotin. Because the process requires vicinal diols, periodate oxidation is often used to selectively label the 3′-termini of RNA (ribose has vicinal diols) instead of DNA as deoxyribose does not have vicinal diols.\n\nPeriodic acid is also used in as an oxidising agent of moderate strength.\n\nPeriodate is part of a series of oxyacids in which iodine can assume oxidation states of −1, +1, +3, +5, or +7. A number of neutral iodine oxides are also known.\n\nCompounds with a similar structure:\n\nCompounds with similar chemistry:\n"}

Seitz, from a screenplay by James Ashmore Creelman. It stars Louis Wolheim, Robert Armstrong, and Jean Arthur.\n\nThe plot concerns railroading on the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road), and the movie was largely filmed along that railroad's lines in Montana. The railway yard in Miles City, Montana was a primary setting, while rural scenes were shot along the railway line through Sixteen Mile Canyon, Montana. Additional footage was shot in Chicago, Illinois (where the Milwaukee Road was headquartered until 1986 when it went out of business.) The film was the first ever shot in the new Spoor-Berggren Natural Vision Process.\n\nLouis Wolheim plays the boss of the railroad yard in Miles City, Montana. The film opens with a landslide across the tracks in Montana, and a repair crew is dispatched to clear the tracks. Several hobos are lounging nearby and are put to work helping the repair crew. One of the hobos, played by Robert Armstrong, is discovered to have been a former railroad engineer who lost his job due to insubordination. He is given a new job for the railroad by the yard boss, but quickly falls in love with the boss's fiancée, played by Jean Arthur.\n\nJealousy grows between the two over the affections of Arthur with both of them attempting to win her in marriage. Things come to a head during a fight in the railroad yard between the two, during which Wolheim is hit by a train and injured. To save his life, Armstrong must transport him in record time to Chicago for surgery.\n\n\n\"Danger Lights\" was filmed during a period when some movie studios were experimenting with various widescreen film formats. As part of this trend, two versions of the film were created. One used standard 35mm film and Academy ratio, the other used an experimental 65mm widescreen format at a 2:1 aspect ratio. This latter process was called \"Natural Vision\" and was invented by film pioneers George Kirke Spoor and P. John Berggren. The Natural Vision print of the film was reportedly screened at only two theaters (the only two with the equipment necessary to show the film), the State Lake Theater in Chicago and the Mayfair Theater in New York, and no copies of it are known to exist today. \"Danger Lights\" would be the only film created using this process, and the entire effort to move to wide screen would be shelved for several decades due to the increased costs of both production and presentation.\n\n\"Danger Lights\" features rare footage of a tug of war between two steam locomotives, actual documentary footage of the activities in the Miles City yard, and what is believed to be the only motion picture footage of a dynamometer car from the steam railroad era in the USA. Similar footage may have existed in MGM's \"Thunder\" (1929), with Lon Chaney but that film now only exist in fragments making it partly a lost film.\n\nIn 1958, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.\n\n\"Danger Lights\" was edited down to 55 minutes for television broadcast; this version is freely available for download. In 2009 Alpha Video released the original 74 minute version on DVD.\n\n"}

As archbishop, he had a difficult relationship with King Offa of Mercia, who at one point confiscated lands from the archbishopric. By 787, some of the bishoprics under Canterbury's supervision were transferred to the control of the newly created Archbishopric of Lichfield, although it is not clear if Jænberht ever recognised its legitimacy. Besides the issue with Lichfield, Jænberht also presided over church councils in England. He died in 792 and was considered a saint after his death.\n\nJænberht was a monk at St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury before being selected as abbot of that monastic house. He came from a prominent family in the kingdom of Kent, and a kinsman of his, Eadhun, was the reeve of King Egbert II of Kent. Jænberht himself was on good terms with Egbert.\n\nJænberht was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury on 2 February 765, at the court of King Offa of Mercia; this location implies that his election was acceptable to the king. In 766, he received a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority given by the papacy. At this time, Kent had been subjected by Offa; in 776, perhaps at the urging of Jænberht, Kent rebelled and secured its freedom. In 780 and 781, Jænberht attended church councils at Brentford that were led by King Offa. Although initially on good terms with Offa, Jænberht's ties to Egbert were also strong: after the Battle of Otford, Egbert granted a number of estates to Christ Church. When Offa reasserted control over Kent, which occurred by 785 at the latest, he confiscated these lands and regranted to some of his thegns.\n\nDuring Jænberht's term of office, a dispute arose between the see of Canterbury and Offa which led in 787 to the creation of the rival Archdiocese of Lichfield under Hygberht. Originally, Offa attempted to bring the southern archbishopric of Canterbury to London, but when the papacy refused permission, Offa secured the creation of a third archbishopric in the British Isles. Lichfield was the main Mercian bishopric, and thus the new archbishopric was under Offa's control. There were several reasons for the conflict between Jænberht and Offa. Jænberht's opposed Offa's deposition of the Kentish dynasty. They conflicted over land which they both claimed as theirs, and Jænberht refused to crown Offa's son Ecgfrith. Problems were also caused by the archbishop minting his own coins at Canterbury. Matthew Paris, writing in the thirteenth century, stated that Jænberht conspired to admit Charlemagne to Canterbury if he invaded Britain. This story may reflect a genuine tradition recorded at St Albans Abbey, where Paris was based, or it may be a fabrication to fill in details of Jænberht's life where Paris had no other information. A rumour during Jænberht's reign also falsely claimed that Offa was plotting with Charlemagne to depose Pope Hadrian I; at least one modern historian, Simon Keynes, believes it possible Jænberht was behind the rumour. Offa's eventual successor later admitted to the papacy that Offa's actions had been motivated by hatred of Jænberht and the Kentish people.\n\nIn 787, Pope Hadrian sent a pallium to Hygberht of Lichfield, elevating Lichfield to an archbishopric, and Ecgfrith was crowned. There is no extant contemporary evidence, however, that Jænberht ever recognised Hygberht as an archbishop. Canterbury retained as suffragans the bishops of Winchester, Sherborne, Selsey, Rochester, and London. The dioceses of Worcester, Hereford, Leicester, Lindsey, Dommoc and Elmham were transferred to Lichfield.\n\nJænberht presided at a council held at London, sometime after the elevation of Lichfield, attended by most of the bishops from southern Britain. Jænberht died on 12 August 792. Jænberht was buried in the abbey church of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury. Jænberht has since been revered as a saint, with a feast day of 12 August.\n\n"}

She is descended from the royal lineage of Champa-Kelantan-Pattani.\n\nShe was known as a warrior princess and was said to be able to enter battle on horseback with a sword with an army of female horseriders. It was said that she and her adopted daughter, Puteri Saadong had mystical powers.\n\nA pair of muntjacs — being the queen's favourite pet — is depicted in Kelantan's state emblem to represent her prominence in the state's rich history.\n\nAccording to certain historical records, Cik Siti Wan Kembang was born in 1585. Her parents were Raja Ahmad and Cik Banun, both of royal lineage. Raja Ahmad was crowned Ruler of Kelantan in 1584.\n\nHowever, Raja Ahmad died in 1589, when the princess was only 4 years old. Therefore, Raja Hussein of Johor was made Regent of Kelantan. Cik Siti Wan Kembang ascended to the throne of Kelantan in 1610 AD upon the death of Raja Hussein. She was said to have resided in Gunung Chinta Wangsa, Ulu Kelantan, located approximately 40 km from Kuala Krai.\n\nCik Siti never married, and therefore never had children of her own. She adopted Puteri Saadong as her daughter. Puteri Saadong was the princess of the ruler of Jembal, whom Cik Siti had close ties with.\n\nDiffering views are given regarding the origin of the Kijang gold coins. \"Kijang\" means \"muntjac\" in the Malay language and derives its name from the engravings of said animal on the coin. The Kijang coins are generally associated with Cik Siti.\n\nAccording to Kelantanese folklore, the \"kijang\" is her favorite pet and has always fond of it since young while some stories suggest that there are once an Arab trader come to her country and seeking permission to trade presented a muntjac to the Queen as a gift. She became very fond of the muntjac and taking it as her pet to the point she ordered its image to be inscribed on the gold coins of her country.\n\nAnother version was linked to the influence of Saivite Hinduism. The connection was based on the fact that the earliest issue of \"Kijang\" coins resembled the Indian humped-back bull and the bull motif was depicted on ancient Hindu coins which were circulated in the northern Malay states.\n\nJelasin fort (Malay: Kota Jelasin) is situated in the southern suburbs of Kota Bharu, the state capital of Kelantan. The site is approximately 4 to 8 kilometres from the town centre, in the ward of Wakaf Che Yeh. It was built in 1563 for Cik Siti Wan Kembang, her adopted daughter Puteri Saadong and Puteri Saadong's husband, Raja Abdullah.\n\nBelieved to be located on the eastern banks of the Kelantan River, the fort was made from thick wood with beautiful carvings and was very famous during the reign of Che Siti. It was used to defend Kelantan from outside attacks. According to history, Jelasin Fort was attacked by the King of Siam and Puteri Saadong disappeared after that. The condition of the fort soon deteriorated after her disappearance and the ruins of the fort is hardly noticeable nowadays as not much effort has been taken to conserve it.\n\nLegend has it that Che Siti never died but instead \"disappeared\" into the mystical world, and reappears from time to time. After her \"disappearance\", she was succeeded by her adopted daughter, Puteri Saadong, who was the youngest daughter of Raja Jembal.\n"}

He attended Wallasey and Calday Grange Grammar School and worked as a crime journalist at the \"Birkenhead Advertiser\" before joining the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in 1936 as their 55th volunteer.\n\nIn June 1940 he joined No. 504 Squadron RAF. He became known among his flight comrades as “Arty” which was taken from the initials of his name R.T.\n\nOn 15 September 1940, known as Battle of Britain Day, Sergeant Holmes was flying a Hawker Hurricane fighter when he spotted a formation of three Dornier Do 17 bombers of Kampfgeschwader 76 heading for central London, to make a bombing attempt. As he made an attack on one of the bombers, the bomber fired a flamethrower at him, and Holmes' windscreen was covered in oil.\n\nThe flamethrower, obviously intended for use on the ground, was not working properly at 16,000 feet, giving a jet of flame only some 100 yards long. The oil had not caught fire, and it was this that had found its way onto the Hurricane. Knowing that the airflow would clear the oil away, Ray Holmes waited for his view to be restored. As his windscreen cleared Ray realised that he was dangerously close to the Dornier, and ramming the stick forward, passed beneath the bomber.\n\n\"I made my attack on this bomber and he spurted out a lot of oil, just a great stream over my aeroplane. blotting out my windscreen. I couldn't see a damn thing. Then, as the windscreen cleared, I suddenly found myself going straight into his tail. So I stuck my stick forward and went under him, practically grazing my head on his belly.\"\n\nHe attacked the second Dornier, causing a crew member to bail out.\n\n\"I got to the stern of the aeroplane and was shooting at him when suddenly something white came out of the aircraft. I thought that a part of his wing had come away but in actual fact it turned out to be a man with a parachute coming out. I was travelling at 250 miles per hour, it all happened so quickly, but before I knew what had happened this bloody parachute was draped over my starboard wing. There was this poor devil on his parachute hanging straight out behind me, and my aeroplane was being dragged. All I could do was to swing the aeroplane left and then right to try to get rid of this man. Fortunately, his parachute slid off my wing and down he went, and I thought, Thank heavens for that!\"\nHolmes then spotted the third Dornier still heading onwards, making directly for Buckingham Palace. Avoiding the bomber's machine gunfire, Holmes quickly climbed ahead of it, then swung around to make a head-on attack on the Dornier. however upon firing discovered his machine guns failed. Holmes decided to ram the bomber hoping his plane could withstand the impact and cut through it. He flew his plane into the top-side of the German bomber, cutting off the rear tail section with his wing.\n\n\"As I fired, my ammunition gave out. I thought, Hell, he's got away now. And there he was coming along and his tail looked very fragile and very inviting. So I thought I'd just take off the tip of his tail. So I went straight at it along him and hit his port fin with my port wing. I thought, That will just take his fin off and he'll never get home without the tail fin. I didn't allow for the fact that the tail fin was actually part of the main fuselage. Although I didn't know it at the time, I found out later that I had knocked off the whole back half of the aircraft including the twin tails.\"\nOn the ground, the event was captured on film, and witnessed by a large group of people in nearby Hyde Park. Jimmy Earley was playing football at the corner of Ebury Bridge Road, near Victoria station. The air-raid siren had gone off, but as usual he and his friends ignored it. Suddenly they heard gunfire. Earley recalled, \"We ran up to the Ebury Bridge and I can remember the Hurricane seemed to go underneath the Dornier, which split and all of sudden - wallop! - it came down in no time. Obviously the Hurricane pilot had no care for his own safety, he couldn't have done. He just hit it and the back of it came off.\" \nHolmes' own plane began to dive to the left, and was no longer responding to the controls. As the Hurricane went into a vertical dive, Holmes bailed out. As he climbed out, the air-stream caught him and smacked him down on to the roof of the Hurricane. Then, as he was thrown backwards, his shoulder hit his own tail fin. When he finally managed to pull his ripcord, the jolt shook off his flying boots and he found himself swinging violently about. Above him he could see the Dornier dive out of control and crash near Victoria tube station.\n\nThe pilot of the Dornier, Feldwebel Robert Zehbe, bailed out, only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack. The Observer of the aircraft, Unteroffizier Hans Goschenhofer, and Gunner, Unteroffizier Gustav Hobel, did not survive the crash. However, Radio Operator, Gefreiter Ludwig Armbruster, bailed out over Syndenham, and Flight Engineer, Unteroffizier Leo Hammermeister, bailed out over Dulwich. Jim Earley watched Holmes' Hurricane crash twenty yards from where they had been playing football, near the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Earley recalled, \"As soon as it hit the road, it went straight down and burst the water main. Water was all over the place, my feet were soaked.\"\n\nHolmes came down in a narrow back garden, and ended up dangling inside an empty dustbin.\n\n\"I got hold of the guy ropes and stopped the spinning and looked down. I was right over the railway lines running into Victoria Station. I thought, \"Hell, I'm going to get electrocuted now after all this!\" Then I was swinging towards a row of houses. I hit the roof of one and could not get any grip on the slates in my stockinged feet. I slithered down the roof until I got to the gutter and thought, Now I'm going to break my back and kill myself falling off a three-storey house! But as I fell there was a sudden jerk and I stopped with just my toes on the ground. My canopy had snagged over an up pipe running past the gutter and that had stopped me. But both my feet were inside a dustbin, the lid was on the ground; the bin had obviously had just been emptied. My two toes touched the bottom of the bin but my heels were off the ground.\"\n\nCalmly, Holmes undid the parachute harness and dusted himself down. In the next garden were two girls who had seen him come down. Holmes recalled, \"I went over the fence and we all kissed each other\". Jim Earley recalled the ecstatic crowd that greeted the downed pilot as he made his way out into the street. \"The blokes were shaking his hand, but it was mostly women gathered around him. I wish it had been me, they all cuddled him and kissed him. Then he was carried over their heads towards Chelsea Barracks. Everybody was touching him as he was taken over the bridge. You know, I don't think he wanted to go to Chelsea Barracks, I think he wanted to stay where he was being made a fuss off!\"\n\nHolmes was feted by the press as a war hero for his saving of Buckingham Palace. As the RAF did not practice ramming as an air combat tactic, this was considered an impromptu manoeuvre, and an act of selfless courage. This event became one of the defining moments of the Battle of Britain and elicited a congratulatory note to the RAF from Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, who had witnessed the event. The bomber's engine was later exhibited at the Imperial War Museum in London.\n\nWhen recovered, he became part of No 81 Squadron, and was sent to the Northern Front near Murmansk in Soviet Russia to help train the Russian air force in flying the Hawker Hurricane. Here he claimed a further kill; a Bf 109 F. He married Elizabeth Killip in April 1941 and was commissioned as a Pilot Officer on 10 June 1941, promoted to Flying Officer on 10 June 1942, and Flight Lieutenant on 10 June 1943.\n\nReturning from Russia, Holmes served as an instructor with 2 FIS, Montrose, from 1942 until 1944. He then flew PR Spitfires with 541 Squadron from February 1945.\n\nAfter the war, he was a King's Messenger, personally delivering mail for British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. After leaving the RAF in late 1945, he returned to journalism, joining his father's news agency covering Liverpool Crown Court for local and national newspapers.\n\nHe had two daughters with his wife, Elizabeth, who died in 1964. He later married Anne Holmes in 1966, with whom he had two children: a son and a daughter.\nIn 1989, he published his autobiography entitled \"Sky Spy: From Six Miles High to Hitler's Bunker\".\n\n65 years later, the wreckage of Holmes' Hurricane was discovered and successfully excavated from the streets of London. The discovery was featured on the National Geographic Channel documentary,\n\"\"The Search for the Lost Fighter Plane\"\".\n\nHe was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Wirral in January 2005.\n\nHe died on 27 June 2005, aged 90 at Hoylake Cottage Hospital, following a two-year battle with cancer. He was buried in Rake Lane Cemetery, Wallasey.\n\nThe Edward Fox character \"Pilot Officer Archie\", in the film \"Battle of Britain\", was based on Holmes. Holmes also was mentioned in an episode of \"Battlefield Britain\". His story was also subject of the National Geographic Channel documentary,\n\"\"The Search for the Lost Fighter Plane\"\".\n\n\n\n"}

Her signature roles were the Queen of the Night in Mozart's \"Die Zauberflöte\" and Zerbinetta in \"Ariadne auf Naxos\" by Richard Strauss. She created roles including Scolatella in Henze's \"König Hirsch\".\n\nBorn in Munich, Hallstein studied with her mother, Elisabeth Hallstein, and debuted at the opera house in Passau, Germany, in 1957 as Musetta in Puccini's \"La bohème\".\n\nAfter engagements at the Theater Basel and the Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz in Munich she made her Salzburg Festival debut in 1960 as Rosina in Mozart's \"La finta semplice\". The same year she joined the Bavarian State Opera, a full member there from 1961 to 1973. She created the role of Scolatella in the revised version of Henze's \"König Hirsch\" in Kassel in 1963, and Autonoe in his \"Die Bassariden\" at the 1966 Salzburg Festival.\n\nIn the following years, Hallstein appeared as a guest to important opera houses in the world, including Deutsche Oper Berlin, Hamburg State Opera, La Fenice in Venice, and the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires. She also sang at the Royal Opera House in London with Otto Klemperer and first sang one of her signature roles for the reopening of the Theater an der Wien, the Queen of the Night in Mozart's \"Die Zauberflöte\", conducted by Herbert von Karajan.\n\nHer voice was well focused and she was capable of commanding dramatic phrasing and emotional expression. In opera, she sang some of the most demanding roles in the coloratura Fach. Her signature role was Zerbinetta in \"Ariadne auf Naxos\" by Richard Strauss.

It operated by the Cassiar Asbestos Corporation, which also operated the asbestos mine in Cassiar, British Columbia, from 1966 to 1978, when it was closed and the buildings auctioned off.\n\nRoad access was available via a road that joined with Yukon Highway 3, known since 1978 as Yukon territorial highway 9, the Top of the World Highway. Mining product was transported across the Yukon River at Dawson City by ferry in summer, ice road in winter, and by a tram system in the spring and fall. At the time, at least some Dawson City residents demanded that a bridge be built. The community was fairly well served, with dial telephone service, and it was one of the only six communities in Yukon with television service before 1973.\n\nClinton Creek had a population of 500, a main building housing the post office, grocery store, cafeteria (used mainly for mine workers), and the remaining rooms served for community social gatherings like a projector set up for weekly reel movies, and a snack bar.\n\nUpon the closing of the townsite, many residents dispersed to other mining towns like Cassiar, British Columbia, and Faro, Yukon.\n\nAlthough the townsite is now abandoned, the road is passable to allow access to the historic ghost town of Fortymile, which was itself abandoned around 1898 when Dawson City boomed. Fortymile was the location of a mining office where the Klondike gold strike claim was registered by George Carmack and his two relatives, Dawson Charlie and Skookum Jim Mason.\n"}

The royal charter issued by Queen Victoria in 1841, which declared that the university would both train students as Presbyterian ministers and instruct youth “in the various branches in Science and Literature”, laid the Faculty's foundations, and — even though Theology seemed predominant for many years — made it possible for Queen's to emerge at last as a full-grown university with faculties of medicine and applied science.\n\nQueen's opened its doors on March 7, 1842, making it the Dominion's first active university in all the 1860 kilometers between Fredericton, New Brunswick and the Pacific Ocean. Thirteen students enrolled in the first courses, which were offered in a small, wood-frame house on the edge of Kingston where the Reverends Peter Colin Campbell and J.A. Williamson as well as the University's first Principal, Thomas Liddell taught Classics, Mathematics and Natural Philosophy.\n\nTwenty years later, the student body had swelled to 200 young men — an enrolment comparable to the universities of McGill, Toronto and Victoria that had come into being in the meantime. The faculty grew as well and its complement of five professors — including its first professor in History, a part-time lecturer without salary! — offered a broader range of subjects in the arts and sciences. Since the professoriate hailed predominantly from Britain, great care was taken to recruit faculty members under the age of 40 who, it was thought, would have less difficulty “adjusting to Canadian conditions”.\n\nToday, the Faculty of Arts and Science is the largest faculty at Queen's, with approximately 8,500 full- and 1,000 part-time undergraduate students, 1,500 graduate students, and 450 faculty. It offers a broad range of undergraduate degree programs in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, fine arts, and languages. The Faculty also offers correspondence, spring and summer courses through its Arts and Science Online Department.\n\nThe School of Computing makes its home in Goodwin Hall. It has the highest graduate-undergraduate ratio of any department at Queen's (nearly 2:1). The Turing Award (called the \"Nobel Prize of Computing\") has only ever been award to 2 Canadians, one of which was a Queen's alumnus.\n\nOffering courses and programs in Drama, Film and Media, Fine Art (Visual Art), Music, and Music Theatre.\n\nOffering courses and programs in Classics, English Language and Literature, French Studies, Languages, Literatures and Cultures, and Linguistics. Languages offered include: Anishinaabemowin, Arabic, Chinese, German, Hebrew, Inuktitut, Italian, Japanese, Mohawk, Portuguese, Spanish, German, Spanish and Latin American Studies, and World Language Studies.\n\nOffering courses and programs in Art History & Art Conservation, Classics, Drama, English Language & Literature, History, Jewish Studies Program, Philosophy, and Religious Studies.\n\nOffering courses and programs in Economics, Environmental Studies, Gender Studies, Geography, Global Development Studies, Industrial Relations, Kinesiology & Health Studies, Political Studies, Psychology, Sociology, and Urban & Regional Planning.\n\nOffering courses and programs in Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Studies, Geography, Geology, Kinesiology & Health Studies, Life Sciences, Math & Statistics, Physics & Astronomy, and Psychology.\n\nThe faculty's undergraduate student government is the Arts and Science Undergraduate Society (A.S.U.S.). A.S.U.S. sends representatives and its executive to the university-wide undergraduate student government, the AMS. It also has its own assembly and manages its own set of events, organizations, and committees.\n\nThe Physical Health Education & Kinesiology Student Association (PHEKSA) is a student-run group at Queen's University that is composed of a Council, Assembly, and Honorary and Ordinary members.\n\nFounded in 1985, the Concurrent Education Students' Association represents over 900 students enrolled in the Concurrent Education program at Queen's University. Providing a united voice for students in this unique program to all external bodies, as well as facilitating a sense of community remain the main focuses of the Association.\n\nQueen's University Computing Students’ Association (COMPSA) is the student government for Queen's University School of Computing. COMPSA is run by a group of highly motivated students who represent and bring together the entire Computing student community through various events and opportunities.\n\nQueen's Society of Graduate and Professional Students (SGPS) is a student government to provide a voice for all graduate and professional students at Queen's University. SGPS is run by students who represent and build the community of Queen's for all students past the undergraduate level.\n\nSince Queen's began offering “extension” courses in 1889 the Faculty of Arts and Science remains a trailblazer in distance education, offering online courses and programs distinguished by their exceptional quality through Arts and Science Online (previously Continuing and Distance Studies). Programs offered through online studies include: English, Global Development Studies, History, Liberal Studies, Psychology, Life Sciences, Academic Writing, Employment Relations, Entrepreneurship, Innovation & Creativity, French for Professionals, Global Action & Engagement, and Media Studies.\n\nThe Queen's Undergraduate Internship Program (QUIP) provides students with a 12-16 month work experience. QUIP internships are paid, professionally supervised, career-related positions designed to offer second or third year students the opportunity to learn about current advances, practices and technologies in business and industry. This opportunity is open to both domestic and international students.\n"}

In addition to his roles in Hollywood films, he has acted in British films and television shows such as \"The Suspicions of Mr Whicher\" (2014). He wrote and directed \"Tyrannosaur\" (2011), a film loosely based on his directorial debut, the 2007 short film \"Dog Altogether\". He has also acted in and directed several music videos, most notably Coldplay's \"God Put a Smile upon Your Face\" and the Arctic Monkeys' \"Leave Before the Lights Come On\".\n\nConsidine has received an Empire Award, an Evening Standard British Film Award, and a Thessaloniki Film Festival Award for his acting.

He grew up with his brother and 4 sisters in a council estate in Winshill, a village of Burton. His late father, Martin Joseph Considine, was Irish. Considine attended, among other schools, Abbot Beyne Senior School and Burton College. In 1990, Considine enrolled to do a National Diploma in Performing Arts at Burton College, where he first met Shane Meadows. Neither of them completed the course.\n\nIn 1994, Considine moved away to study photography at the University of Brighton. While there he studied under the social documentarian Paul Reas, who described one project, portraits of Considine's parents in their house in Winshill, as \"fucking brilliant\". At one point, Considine was threatened with expulsion, but graduated with a first-class B.A.\n\nAfter graduating from university, Meadows cast Considine in several short films, as well as his second film, \"A Room for Romeo Brass\" (1999). Considine, in his screen debut, played the disturbed character Morell. Considine's performance in the film led to Paweł Pawlikowski casting him in his first starring role in \"Last Resort\" (2000). Considine played the love-struck misfit Alfie, for which he won the Best Actor award at the Thessaloniki Film Festival. After coming to prominence for his roles as Alfie and Morell, Considine increased his profile during the early to mid-2000s with supporting and starring roles in cult films such as \"24 Hour Party People\" and \"In America\".\n\nIn 2004, Considine starred in what was then the most significant role of his career, as Richard in Meadows' revenge film \"Dead Man's Shoes\" (2004), a film he co-wrote and for which he won the Best British Actor award at the 2005 Empire Awards. In the same year, he starred in \"My Summer of Love\", his second film with director Pawel Pawlikowski. Both films were recognised on the award circuit, where Considine earned five nominations and two wins. The following year, Considine played Frank Thorogood (the suspected murderer of Rolling Stones co-founder Brian Jones) in \"Stoned\" (2005).

It was during the filming of this that Considine penned what later became his debut short, \"Dog Altogether\". Considine claims that it was his co-star Gary Oldman who gave him the confidence to make the film, which led to him thanking Oldman during his BAFTA acceptance speech. In 2006, he starred in \"Pu-239\" as Timofey Berezin, a worker at a Russian nuclear facility who gets exposed to a lethal dose of radiation. In 2007, Considine landed roles in two popular big-budget films; the third film in the \"Bourne Trilogy\" film series, \"The Bourne Ultimatum\", in which he played newspaper reporter Simon Ross, and \"Hot Fuzz\", in which he had his first comedic role as DS Andy Wainwright. In 2008, Considine starred in \"My Zinc Bed\" a TV film for BBC / HBO. In 2009, he starred as Peter Hunter in the Channel 4 miniseries \"Red Riding: 1980\", based on the novels by David Peace, and another collaboration with Meadows, \"Le Donk & Scor-zay-zee\", a film which was unscripted, adlibbed, and filmed in five days at a cost of £48,000, and which premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival.\n\nIn 2011, Considine starred in a film adaptation of Joe Dunthorne's book \"Submarine\", which Richard Ayoade wrote and directed. Also in 2011, Considine appeared as Porter Nash in the adaptation of the Ken Bruen novel \"Blitz\", as well as starring as Jack Whicher in \"The Suspicions of Mr Whicher\", written by Helen Edmundson and Neil McKay. In the same year, Considine was briefly reunited with one of his \"A Room for Romeo Brass\" co-stars, BAFTA-winning actress Vicky McClure. The two shared the screen in a television advert to promote \"Films for Life Season\". The ad was shot over two days in Spain.\n\nConsidine has consistently displayed a flair for regional and world accents; along with the Gypsy Midlander Morell in his first role in 1999's \"A Room for Romeo Brass\", Considine played a Londoner in \"Stoned\" and \"The Suspicions of Mr Whicher\", a Russian nuclear plant worker in \"Pu-239\", a Welshman in \"Submarine\", \"Happy Now\" and \"Pride\", an Irish immigrant in \"In America\", a Mancunian in \"Red Riding\", a Yorkshireman in \"My Summer of Love\", an American in \"Cry of the Owl\" and \"Cinderella Man\", and a West Countryman in \"Hot Fuzz\".

Considine previously worked with the cast and crew on \"Hot Fuzz\" (2007). The film was released in the United Kingdom on 19 July 2013, and the United States on 23 August 2013. In August 2015, Considine confirmed that he was writing the screenplay for the film \"Journeyman\", in which he will also star. It is an adaptation of non-fiction novel \"The Years of the Locust\" by Jon Hotten, the true story of a sociopathic boxing promoter, Fat Rick Parker, and his doomed relationship with his naive fighter, Tim Anderson. Considine is also writing a film from a ghost story called \"The Leaning\", with plans to direct both films. He will continue to work with Shane Meadows on \"King of the Gypsies\", a biopic of bare-knuckle fighter Bartley Gorman, whom Considine met and became friends with whilst working as a photographer. In 2015, Considine was cast along Glenn Close, Gemma Arterton in the UK zombie film in \"The Girl with All the Gifts\", based on the 2014 novel \"The Girl with All the Gifts\" by M. R. Carey.\n\nOn 4 October 2015, it was via Considine's official Twitter page that he was about to join the cast of Birmingham-set gangster series \"Peaky Blinders\", seeing him reunited with \"She Who Brings Gifts\" director Colm McCarthy.\n\nIn April 2017, Considine made his professional stage debut in \"The Ferryman\" at the Royal Court Theatre, ahead of a transfer to the Gielgud Theatre in the West End. It is the fastest selling play in Royal Court Theatre history.\nThe production transferred to the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre on Broadway, beginning previews on 2 October 2018. The play, which went on to win four Tony Awards, closed on 7 July 2019. For his performance as Quinn Carney Considine gained nominations for best actor at both the Olivier Awards and The Tony Awards.\n\nIn 2020, He will be seen in an HBO Mini-Series The Third Day alongside Jude Law.\n\nIn 2007, Paddy Considine wrote and directed the award-winning short film \"Dog Altogether\", starring Peter Mullan, partially based on Considine's father. \"Dog Altogether\" won the 2007 BAFTA award for Best Short Film, as well as a Silver Lion for Best Short Film at the 2007 Venice Film Festival, a Best British Short at the 2007 British Independent Film Awards (BIFA), and the Seattle International Film Festival Short Film Jury Award (Narrative Special Jury Prize), as well as a World Cinema Directing Award for his feature directorial debut \"Tyrannosaur\" at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nAfter a short stint in a virtual comedy thrash group called Grunt during college, Considine and Shane Meadows formed the band She Talks To Angels (inspired by the Black Crowes song of the same name) with friends Richard Eaton, Simon Hudson, and Nick Hemming, with Meadows as vocalist and Considine as drummer. Considine left the band, the remaining members re-formed, calling themselves Oslo. Appearing on Jools Holland's show, whilst Considine had moved on to study photography at the University of Brighton, where he formed a new group, a Britpop band called Pedestrians. He is now in a rock band called Riding the Low, who have released an EP 'They Will Rob You of Your Gifts' (2009), and an album 'What Happened to the Get To Know Ya?' (2013).\n\nConsidine and Riding the Low got their big music break in 2014 after Tim Burgess of the Charlatans invited them to perform at his curated Tim Peaks Diner event at Festival No 6 in Portmeirion, Wales. Considine had contacted Burgess after reading his book Telling Stories, to discuss meditation. \"The conversation developed and Tim generously offered to let us play at Portmeirion, It led to the band supporting the Charlatans at the O2 Academy in Leicester this year. I didn't get stage fright. We were ready. We did our history off-camera. We have evolved. We have got better. At first, it was raw – all we had was arrogance. We had a long way to go and we learnt our craft at all these pub gigs. We didn't expect a leg-up just because an actor is in the band.\" said Considine\n\n2016 saw the band release their second full-length album \"Are Here to Help the Neighbourhood\", recorded in Rockfield Studios and produced by Chris Slusarenko. Considine penned the words while the band wrote the music.\n\nIn early 2018, Considine confirmed that the long-anticipated collaboration with Wigan saxophonist Andrew Teddy Brown would finally be released in February 2019 as a concept album entitled Limping Through Life - an epic tale of the struggle faced by a man with a terminal form of Gout. In November 2018, Considine and Brown confirmed that the debut single from Limping Through Life would be called Days Of Delirium - a song about the extreme highs felt by the album’s central character after taking suppositories to combat Gout. The single features guest appearances from Glen Hansard, Duncan James from the group Blue and Mutya Buena (formerly of The Sugarbabes). The single released on Axe Wound Records [of Rotherham].\n\nConsidine remains private in his personal life and once said if he ever became a celebrity, he would \"disappear and go and make shoes like Daniel Day-Lewis\" (a reference to Day-Lewis' sabbatical working as a shoemaker in Italy). In 2002, Considine married Shelley Insley, with whom he has been in a relationship since he was 18. They have three children. Considine lives in his home town of Burton upon Trent with his family.\n\nIn April 2011, Considine revealed that he had been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. Although initially reassured by the diagnosis, he continued to struggle in social situations until he was diagnosed in 2013 with Irlen syndrome, a condition in which the brain cannot adequately process visual stimuli. His condition has improved significantly since he began wearing purple Irlen filters.\n\n"}

He received formal schooling at the San José College in Manila, and obtained a teacher's diploma. He returned to Cavite and worked as a schoolteacher in Naic and Maragondon.\n\nIn 1871, he was incarcerated and tortured by the colonial authorities after insulting a Spanish soldier. The following year, he was accused of involvement in the Cavite Mutiny and was hauled to Manila in chains for detention. Upon his eventual release, he returned to Noveleta, and in 1881, was elected capitan municipal, a position he held until the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution in 1896.\n\nÁlvarez and his son Santiago were active members of the Katipunan, the anti-Spanish secret society founded by Andrés Bonifacio in 1892. Mariano was the uncle of Bonifacio's wife, Gregoria de Jesús.\n\nIn early 1896, Álvarez was elected president of the Magdiwang, one of two Katipunan branches in Cavite along with Magdalo. The two branches evolved into separate factions with their own local governments, through their provincial councils.\n\nÁlvarez helped facilitate growing membership of the Katipunan in Cavite. When the revolution started in August 1896, Bonifacio at least planned to give him overall command of all the revolutionary forces in Cavite. A draft of the appointment order survives but whether it was dispatched is uncertain. \n\nHe led Filipino forces in several battles against the Spanish army in Cavite and held the rank of general. His efforts helped liberate most towns in Cavite from Spanish control within weeks from the start of the revolt. He was recognized as the instigator of the revolution in Cavite.\n\nRivalry and tension existed between the Magdiwang and Magdalo factions over jurisdiction and authority, and Álvarez, as Magdiwang head, invited Bonifacio, as \"Presidente Supremo\" (\"Supreme President\") of the Katipunan, to meditate over them. Bonifacio was seen as partial to the Magdiwang probably due to his kinship ties with Álvarez.\n\nIn their memoirs, Emilio Aguinaldo and other Magdalo personages claim that Bonifacio became the head of the Magdiwang, receiving the title \"Hari ng Bayan\" (“King of the People”) with Álvarez as his second-in-command. However, no documentary sources have been found substantiating these claims. Instead it has been suggested that these claims stem from a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of one of Bonifacio’s titles, \"Pangulo ng Haring Bayan\" (“President of the Sovereign Nation”). In his own memoirs, Santiago Álvarez clearly distinguishes between the Magdiwang government and the Supreme Council of the Katipunan headed by Bonifacio.\n\nThe dispute between the Magdiwang and Magdalo soon involved the issue of command of the revolution. The Magdalo called for the abolition of the Katipunan and the establishment of a revolutionary government. Bonifacio and the Magdiwang maintained the Katipunan was already their government. After losing the internal power struggle to Aguinaldo, Bonifacio was executed in 1897. Álvarez was aggrieved by Bonifacio's death, and, like Emilio Jacinto, refused to join the forces of Aguinaldo, who had then retreated to Biak-na-Bato in Bulacan.\n\nIn May 1863, he married Nicolasa Virata y del Rosario; their only child, Santiago, also a revolutionary general, was born on July 25, 1872 in Imus.\n\nThe United States of America soon gained control over the Philippines following the Spanish–American War and the Philippine–American War. Álvarez affiliated himself with the pro-independence Nacionalista Party and was among the signatories of the party's constitution. He won election as municipal president of Noveleta.\n\nÁlvarez joined the nationalist-oriented Philippine Independent Church founded by Isabelo de los Reyes and Gregorio Aglipay in 1902. He retired to his farm following his term as municipal president, and died on August 25, 1924 from chronic rheumatism at the age of 106.\n\nThe municipality of Gen. Mariano Alvarez, Cavite, established in 1981, was named in his honor.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2134287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2134287", "title": "Feature (linguistics)", "text": "Feature (linguistics)\n\nIn linguistics, a feature is the assignment of binary or unary conditions which act as constraints.\n\nIn phonology, segments are categorized into natural classes on the basis of their distinctive features. Each feature is a quality or characteristic of the natural class, such as voice or manner. A unique combination of features defines a phoneme.\n\nExamples of phonemic or distinctive features are: [+/- voice ], [+/- ATR ] (binary features) and [ CORONAL ] (a unary feature; also a place feature).\n\nSurface representations can be expressed as the result of rules acting on the features of the underlying representation. These rules are formulated in terms of transformations on features.\n\nIn morphology and syntax, words are often organized into lexical categories or word classes, such as \"noun\", \"verb\", \"adjective\", and so on. These word classes have grammatical features (also called \"categories\" or \"inflectional categories\"), which can have one of a set of potential values (also called the \"property\", \"meaning\", or \"feature\" of the category).\n\nFor example, consider the pronoun in English. Pronouns are a \"lexical category\". Pronouns have the person \"feature\", which can have a \"value\" of \"first\", \"second\", or \"third\". English pronouns also have the number \"feature\", which can have a value of either \"singular\" or \"plural\". As a result, we can describe the English pronoun \"they\" as a pronoun with [person:3] and [number:plural]. Third person singular pronouns in English also have a gender feature: \"she\" is [gender:feminine], \"he\" [gender:masculine] and \"it [gender:neuter]. \n\nDifferent lexical categories realise or are specified for different grammatical features: for example, verbs in English are specified for tense, aspect and mood features, as well as person and number. The features that a category realises can also differ from language to language.\n\nThere is often a correspondence between morphological and syntactic features, in that certain features, such as person, are relevant to both morphology and syntax; these are known as \"morphosyntactic features\". Other types of grammatical features, by contrast, may be relevant to semantics (\"morphosemantic features\"), such as tense, aspect and mood, or may only be relevant to morphology (\"morphological features\"). Inflectional class (a word's membership of a particular verb class or noun class) is a purely morphological feature, because it is only relevant to the morphological realisation of the word. \n\nIn formal models of grammar, features can be represented as attribute-value pairs. For example, in Lexical functional grammar, syntactic features are represented alongside grammatical functions at the level of functional structure (f-structure), which takes the form of an attribute-value matrix. \n\nIn semantics, words are categorized into semantic classes. Intersecting semantic classes share the same semantic features. Semantic features can include [±human] and [±animate]. These features may in some instances be realised morphologically, in which case they may also be called \"morphosemantic\" features.\n\n"}

{"id": "2134303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2134303", "title": "Birdwing", "text": "Birdwing\n\nBirdwings are butterflies in the swallowtail family, that belong to the genera \"Trogonoptera\", \"Troides\", and \"Ornithoptera\". Most recent authorities recognise 36 species, however, this is debated, and some authorities include additional genera. Birdwings are named for their exceptional size, angular wings, and birdlike flight. They are found across tropical Asia, mainland and archipelagic Southeast Asia, and Australasia.\n\nIncluded among the birdwings are some of the largest butterflies in the world: the largest, Queen Alexandra's birdwing; the second largest, the Goliath birdwing; the largest butterfly endemic to Australia, the Cairns birdwing; and the largest butterfly in India, the southern birdwing. Another well-known species is Rajah Brooke's birdwing, a particularly attractive species named after Sir James Brooke, the first White Rajah of 19th-century Sarawak.\n\nDue to their size and brightly coloured males, they are popular among collectors of butterflies, but all birdwings are now listed by CITES, thereby limiting (and in the case of \"O. alexandrae\" completely banning) international trade.\n\ngenus: \"Troides\"\n\ngenus: \"Trogonoptera\"\n\ngenus: \"Ornithoptera\"\n\n\nAfter mating, females immediately begin to seek appropriate host plants; climbing vines of the genera \"Aristolochia\" and \"Pararistolochia\" (both in the family Aristolochiaceae) are sought exclusively. The female lays her spherical eggs under the tips of the vine's leaves, one egg per leaf.\n\nThe caterpillars are voracious eaters but move very little; a small group will defoliate an entire vine. If starved due to overcrowding, the caterpillars may resort to cannibalism. Fleshy spine-like tubercles line the caterpillars' backs, and their bodies are dark red to brown and velvety black. Some species have tubercles of contrasting colours, often red, or pale \"saddle\" markings. Like other members of their family, birdwing caterpillars possess a retractable organ behind their heads called an \"osmeterium\". Shaped like the forked tongue of a snake, the osmeterium excretes a fetid terpene-based compound and is deployed when the caterpillar is provoked. The caterpillars are also unappealing to most predators due to their toxicity: the vines which the caterpillars feed upon contain aristolochic acid, a poisonous compound known to be carcinogenic in rats. The feeding caterpillars incorporate and concentrate the aristolochic acid into their tissues, where the poison will persist through metamorphosis and into adulthood.\n\nBirdwing chrysalids are camouflaged to look like a dead leaf or twig. Before pupating, the caterpillars may wander considerable distances from their host plants. In \"O. alexandrae\", it takes about four months to get from egg to adult. Barring predation, this species can also survive up to three months as an adult.\n\nBirdwings inhabit rainforests and adults are usually glimpsed along the forest periphery. They feed upon—and are important long-range pollinators of—nectar-bearing flowers of the forest canopy, as well as terrestrial flowers, such as lantana. They are strong flyers and seek sunlit spots in which to bask.\n\nBreeding behaviour varies little between species; the female's role is relatively passive, slowly fluttering from perch to perch while the male performs an elaborate, quivering yet stationary dance 20–50 cm above her.\nBirdwings are typified by large size (up to a maximum body length of 7.6 cm or 3 inches and a wingspan of 28 cm or 11 inches in \"O. alexandrae\"), showy colouration (in contrasting shades of green, yellow, black, white, and sometimes blue or orange), and slender, lanceolate forewings. With few exceptions (i.e., the New Guinean \"O. meridionalis\" and \"O. paradisea\"), the hindwings lack tails. Sexual dimorphism is strong in \"Ornithoptera\" species only, where males are black combined with bright iridescent green, blue, orange, or yellow while the larger and less colourful females are overall black or dark brownish with white, pale brown, or yellow markings.\n\nMales and females of most \"Troides\" birdwings are similar and have jet black to brown dorsal forewings, often with the veins bordered in grey to creamy white. At least one of these darkly-coloured species (\"T. rhadamantus\") possesses thermoreceptors on the anal veins (A2 and A3) of the wings and on the antennal clubs. The antennal receptors of the clubs—which also possess hygroreceptors that measure atmospheric humidity—are known as \"sensilla basiconica\". The thermoreceptors are sensitive to sudden increases in temperature; they are thought to help the butterfly thermoregulate and avoid overheating while basking.\n\nThe colours of most species are pigmentary (via papiliochrome); but two species, \"Troides magellanus\" and the much rarer \"T. prattorum\", are noted for their use of limited-view iridescence: the yellow of the dorsal hindwings is modified by bright blue-green iridescence which is only seen when the butterfly is viewed at a narrow, oblique angle. This \"grazing iridescence\" is brought about through diffraction of light (after back-reflection) by the wings' extremely steeply-set, multilayered rib-like scales (rather than the ridge-lamellae of most other iridescent butterflies, such as \"Morpho\" species). Such limited-view iridescence was previously only known from one other species, the riodinid \"Ancyluris meliboeus\". In \"A. meliboeus\", however, the iridescence is produced by ridge-lamellar scales and features a wider range of colours.\n\nThe close evolutionary relationship between \"Troides\" and \"Ornithoptera\" butterflies is well demonstrated by the fact that commercial breeders have produced numerous hybrids between the two.\n\nThe final and smallest genus is \"Trogonoptera\" with just two species. They resemble each other, being overall black with iridescent green markings and a red head. Females are duller than males.\n\nBirdwings are generally found from Southeast Asia to northern Australasia. \"Trogonoptera brookiana\" inhabits the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Natuna, Sumatra, and various surrounding islands. \"Trogonoptera trojana\" is endemic to Palawan in the Philippines. \"Troides\" species are distributed widely across the Indomalayan realm, but may be found as far east as New Guinea in the case of \"Troides oblongomaculatus\". Some species may be found as far west as India, and are the westernmost distributed of all birdwings. All \"Ornithoptera\" species are found in the northern portion of the Australasian realm, east of Weber's line; the Moluccas, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and northeastern Australia. An outlier is \"Ornithoptera richmondia\", which may be found in far northeastern New South Wales, Australia in the southernmost area of its range; the southernmost distribution of all birdwings.\n\nWith the exception of Queen Alexandra's birdwing (\"O. alexandrae\"), all birdwings are listed in Appendix II of CITES, and accordingly their trade is restricted in countries that have signed the CITES convention. Exceptions are made for captive-reared specimens, which mainly originate from ranches in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. Most species of all three genera have now been reared in captivity, though with significant differences in the quantities reared of each species. \"O. alexandrae\" is listed on Appendix I and therefore cannot legally be traded internationally. At the 2006 meeting of the CITES Animals Committee some suggested \"O. alexandrae\" should be moved to Appendix II, as the conservation benefits of sustainable management perhaps are higher than those of the trade ban.\n\nThree \"Troides\" and eight \"Ornithoptera\" species have been given assessments by the IUCN Red List, with classifications ranging from \"least concern\" to \"endangered\".\n\nRichmond birdwings (\"O. richmondia\") depend on the plant \"Aristolochia praevenosa\" which they need for their caterpillars. However, the very similar \"Aristolochia elegans\" (Dutchman's pipe) which can be found in many Australian backyards, kills the caterpillars.\n\n\"Ornithoptera\", or the genus of birdwing butterflies, usually reproduce sexually and are oviparous. In butterflies sex is determined by a WW/WZ system, with a heterogametic female, reverse of that found in mammals and many other insects, which have a hetergametic male. During copulation males will transfer an ejaculate containing both sperm and accessory substances that can make up to fifteen percent of a males body mass.\n\nMating systems, first explored in evolutionary terms by Darwin, includes all behaviours associated with sexual reproduction. Mating systems include all costs and benefits, pre- and postcopulatory competitions, displays and mate choice. Butterfly mating systems have great variation, including strict monandry, one male and one female, to polyandry, having many mates of the opposite sex. Typically \"Ornithoptera\" tend to be polygamous, mating with more than one individual.\n\nFemale choice can have a serious impact on mate selection and successful reproduction. Several species of \"Ornithoptera\" have been known to create hybrids if they have no access to their own species. \"Troides oblongamaculatus\" females have been known to choose to mate with other species such as \"Ornithoptera priamus poseidon\", which will attempt mating if their own species is not to be found near by. The females will typically resist mating attempts by covering their abdomen with their forewings or dropping to the ground, making mating near impossible. Although the females usually resist these mating attempts, they have been noted to be more susceptible if they have not had previous encounters with males of their own species.\n\nSome male \"Ornithoptera\" species demonstrate courtship behaviour. \"Ornithoptera priamus posedion\" males will approach a female carefully, and examine the female for several minutes. After consideration, the male may choose to hover twenty to thirty centimeters above the female, displaying the bright yellow marking on its hindwings. Meanwhile, the forewings will move forward, exposing the abdomen and androconial hair tufts. Mating is only attempted when the female has ceased to flap her wings. After about thirty seconds of the display, the male will attempt copulation.\n\nIn many animals, females often mate with more than one male. Males who are able will adapt strategies such as postcopulatory guarding to ensure the paternity of the offspring. Following insemination, it is common for the male \"Ornithoptera\" to produce a mating plug, which will seal the ostium bursae and prevent remating by the female, as new sperm is unable to enter the opening. The plug does not impede oviposition and may stay in place for the duration of the female's life.\n\nSexual dimorphism is very prominent in \"Ornithoptera\" species, the males being black with brightly colored markings of blue, green, orange or yellow and the females are overall black or dark brown. The sexual dichromatism functions in mate recognition by the use of photoreceptors. Due to the protected nature of \"Ornithoptera\" it has been difficult to study the spectral sensitivities of the sexes although this difference in coloration alludes to the idea of sensory exploitation of the female's photoreceptors. The sensory bias of females to select for males with brighter wings has yet to be studied in \"Ornithoptera\".\n\nGyanandromorphism is a very rare condition in which an organism simultaneously expresses both male and female phenotypes. It is only observed in species that express strong sexual dimorphism. Gynandromorphs are suspected to be due to genetic errors associated with cell division such as nondisjunction, as well as fertilization of binucleate ova and fertilisation of multiple sperm that may fuse and act as a second nucleus. \"Ornithoptera\" is known to commonly exhibit this phenomenon, but little to no research has been successful in determining why. Those who experience this phenomenon, usually females, show male-pigmented tissues on their wings.\n\n\n"}

He attended school at Hamilton High School, where his father was head teacher. After leaving school he worked as a clerk for Bill Slater a local barrister who was also the local Labor Member of Parliament. In 1933 he moved to Melbourne to study law at the University of Melbourne. Despite being awarded for his academic knowledge he did not finish his legal degree until 1981. It was during his time at the university that he joined the Communist Party of Australia (CPA).\n\nHe was admitted to practice as a barrister and solicitor in 1938 and soon became well known as the CPA's leading legal figure, defending the party and its members in several well-known trials. In 1951 he advised Frank Hardy in his prosecution for criminal libel over his novel \"Power Without Glory\".

The very bottom of the mountain is dominated by the Thunderbowl, an expansive steep intermediate run that normally hosts most of the ski competitions on the mountain. The lower mountain also contains challenging expert runs such as Lower Stein, Golden Horn Woods, and The P-Chutes. It is served by the Exhibition and Thunderbowl lifts. The Mid-Mountain area is anchored by the 60s era Merry-Go-Round restaurant, with a large, south-facing deck. The Merry-Go-Round also serves as the hub of the major chairlifts on mountain. The Cloud Nine lift serves primarily intermediate and difficult runs on the mid-mountain as well as Scarlett's, a mogul run. The summit of Cloud Nine lift is the location of Cloud Nine Bistro, with views of the Maroon Bells. As of December 2017, Aspen Highlands has changed its trail map so that there is no more beginner terrain. This is presumably to encourage novice skiers to go to Buttermilk or Snowmass.\n\nWhat attracts most skiers to Highlands is the dramatic, just-above-timberline summit of the mountain. The upper mountain is primarily served by the Loge Peak high speed quad originating at the Merry-Go-Round. The ridge that extends down from Loge Peak (the lift-served summit) has only one intermediate run, Broadway, which follows the ridge spine. On the skiers right side is Steeplechase, an area of long and steep terrain with some runs reaching upwards of 45 degrees. Farther down is the Olympic bowl which contains steep slopes in and out of glades. Views of the Maroon Bells, Pyramid Peak, Hayden Mountain, and the Highland Bowl greet skiers at the summit.\n\nSince 2002, the Highland Bowl has been the crown jewel of Aspen Highlands. Most of the terrain is accessed only by hiking from the top of Loge Peak, although a snowcat can cut the distance by a third. Including the hike-to terrain in Highland Bowl, Highlands' skiable vertical descent increases to . The Highlands ski patrol monitors the Bowl and conducts avalanche control for skier safety. The Bowl faces primarily east, towards Aspen Mountain. Generally, the best snow to be found is in the north-facing G-Zones (\"G\" corresponds to green ski wax, for the coldest temperature snow). The B-Zones (for blue wax) face east and descend down the center of the bowl from the summit of Highland Peak. The south-facing Y-Zones (yellow wax), are the steepest, with slopes as steep as 48 degrees, according to Aspen Highlands trail maps. These can be skied without hiking. Prior to the construction of the Deep Temerity lift in 2005, a run down the Highland Bowl required then taking the Grand Traverse, a long, flat catwalk, to get back to the Loge Peak lift. The Highland Bowl also offers access from the summit into the steep and highly avalanche prone backcountry Five Fingers Bowl.\n\nOn March 31, 1984, ski patrolmen Chris Kessler, Tom Snyder, and Craig Soddy were completing avalanche control work in Highland Bowl. The three set off explosive charges near the top of the Bowl. Their bombs yielded no sign of danger and they continued to do explosive work. Their second explosion triggered a slide and before the three could escape an avalanche fell from above them. All three died. A monument in their memory has been erected near the top of the Loge Peak lift above the ski runs named in their honor (Kessler's Bowl, Snyder's Ridge, and Soddbuster).\n\n\nJust before the 2005-2006 season The Aspen Skiing Company completed work on the new fixed grip triple lift \"Deep Temerity\". The $2.7 million project eliminated the lengthy trek out from the bottom of the Highland Bowl, the Temerity glades, and Steeplechase. of new terrain accompany the Deep Temerity lift for the 05-06 season, with the ultimate potential for of new terrain. This will push Aspen Highlands' total area over .\n\nAspen Highlands, was the backdrop for the bowl skiing in the 1993 movie Aspen Extreme.\n\n\n"}

Before the end of this period in Sidney's life, events will take place that are truly life-altering, and Sidney will, much like the fictional character he writes of, have to deal with issues and questions he has previously (perhaps unconsciously) been avoiding for several years.\n\nThe main character, Sidney Orr, is in many ways quite similar to Paul Auster. They are both residents of Brooklyn,\nmiddle-aged, married, and, of course, writers. Some similarities between Auster and a supporting character\nin \"Oracle Night\"—John Trause—are also apparent. Trause, an anagram of Auster, also lived in Paris for a period of his life.\n\n"}

State and private media operators provide services in the main languages Sinhala, Tamil and English. The government owns two major TV stations, radio networks operated by the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC), and newspaper titles in Sinhala, Tamil, and English.\n\nAfter the growth of Sri Lankan economy, many satellite TV channels were introduced.\n\nHowever, there are over a dozen privately owned radio stations and more than 30 privately operated television stations. They often engage in political debates.\n\nThe use of the internet is a growing force within Sri Lanka, many of the newspapers now have online editions. Because of the limited circulation for the daily and weekly newspapers, they are heavily dependent on advertising. As a result of this it is very rare to see Sri Lankan newspapers engage in investigative journalism or daring exposés of big business.\n\nPress freedom is a major concern in Sri Lanka. Both sides in the war make efforts to silence inconvenient reporters. Around 15 reporters received death threats from one faction or the other in 2004 The assassinated reporter Aiyathurai Nadesan, correspondent in Batticaloa for several Tamil media stated just prior to his assassination in 2005:\nWe are caught between a rock and a hard place. It is very difficult for us to check reports either with the security forces or the Tamil Tigers. And when a news item on local events is datelined Colombo, it puts us at risk of reprisals on the ground.\nIn 2005, the Tamil newspaper Thinakkural was threatened by Karuna. Copies of the newspaper were burned in the Eastern provinces. On the other hand, distribution of the Tamil weekly Thinamurasu is blocked by the LTTE because it is close to another armed group, the EPDP.\n\nBBC World Service stopped its broadcast in Sinhalese and Tamil for fear of reprisal against its reporters.\n\nDuring the Rajapaksa administration, press freedom in Sri Lanka became the \"worst in any democratic country\", according to the Reporters without borders index, ranking 165th among 173 countries in the index. \nOn 21 November 2008, a twelve-member group of masked men, forcibly entered the printing press of Sunday Leader, Morning Leader and Irudina Sinhala weekly and set fire damaging printing machines and copies of newspapers printed ready for distribution. \nThe state jammed transmission of BBC programs which contained content the government disliked.\nThe main private TV network Sirasa was repeatedly threatened by minister Mervyn Silva, attacked by a petrol bomb on 2.1.2009 and raided by gunmen on 6.1.2009, who set on fire the main control room. This was in response to SLBC criticizing Sirasa's coverage of the capture of Kilinochchi.\n\nAccording to the head of the company, Chevaan Daniel: \"It's either that the citizens of Sri Lanka are able to drive around attacking institutions armed with weapons and grenades, or there is a hand behind it.\"\n\nLasantha Wickrematunge, the chief editor of the English Weekly Sunday Leader and Sri Lanka's most influential journalist, was assassinated on the Thursday January 8, 2009 by unknown gunmen. The newspaper and its editor as well as the editor of Morning Leader have been harassed and threatened continuously during the preceding three years. All Leader publications are very critical towards the government and exponents of opposition political views. According to Reporters without Borders, the Rajapaksa administration blocks investigations into the murder of journalists.\n\nDefence minister Gotabhaya Rajapaksa threatened to chase Chris Morris, a BBC journalists, out of the country, if he does not act responsibly.\n\nLocal reporters in the country continue to be threatened, as was the case with 54-year-old M.I. Rahmathulla, who was beaten in April 2009 for reporting on political corruption in the Batticaloa region of Sri Lanka's Eastern Province.\n\nImportant English language newspapers are the Sunday Leader \"Daily FT\", \"Daily Mirror\", the \"Daily News\", \"Sunday Observer\" and \"The Island\". Sinhalese newspapers are \"Dinamina\", \"Lankadeepa\", \"Lakbima\", and \"Divaena\". Tamil newspapers are \"Uthayan\", 'Tamil Mirror\" \"Thinakaran\", \"Thinakkural\", \"Sudar Oli\", \"Metro\" and \"Virakesari\".\n\nRadio broadcasting in Sri Lanka dates back to 1923. Radio broadcasting, like other forms of media in the country, is generally divided along linguistic lines with state and private media operators providing services in Sinhala, Tamil, and English language.\n\nThe first Television network of Sri Lanka was launched on 13 April 1979. The ITN channel, owned by the Independent Television Network Limited (ITN) became the first terrestrial television channel of Sri Lanka. On June 5, 1979 ITN was converted to a government owned business and was later brought under the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Act of 1982 along with the newly created Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC).\n\nSignificant changes occurred in 1992 as the government permitted the establishment of private television networks. Subsequently, the Maharaja Television Network (MTV) was launched in collaboration with Singapore Telecommunications Limited (SingTel).\n\nSince then many new television networks have come into existence within Sri Lanka. There are also a number of Satellite networks and pay per view television networks in Sri Lanka such as Dialog TV which boasts over one million subscribers in the country. The national telecommunications provider Sri Lanka Telecom also launched an IPTV service in 2008.\n\nSri Lankan cinema is a fledgling industry that has struggled to find a footing since its inauguration in 1947. Sri Lankan films are usually made in the Sinhalese language, the language of the majority Sinhala people.\n\nIn the first nine years most films were made in South India and followed the conventions of Indian cinema. Studio shooting was the norm, with Indian style sets erected in film studios. Even though it is popularly held that \"Rekava\", made in 1956 by pioneer director Lester James Peries, was the first Sinhala film to be shot completely out of studio, it was really the film \"Gambada Sundari\", made in 1950 which was the first film shot outside studios. It was also the first Sri Lankan film where, like in \"Rekawa\", the dialog was recorded on the spot. This was because the film was shot on 16mm, using an Auricon sound-on-film camera which recorded the sound on the 16mm film optically, unlike in the case of where the sound was recorded on a Kinevox 35mm magnetic recorder. The film was later 'blown-up' to 35mm and was screened in Colombo in 1950.\n\nThough \"Rekawa\" was acclaimed by local and international critics, the film failed to find an audience in the country and was a box office failure. Films continued to follow formulaic storylines borrowed from India up through the early 60s despite such efforts as \"Sandesaya\" and \"Kurulu Bedda\".\n\nArtists such as Tissa Abeysekara, Dr. D.B.Nihalsingha, Prasanna Vithanage and Vimukthi Jayasundara have attempted to breathe new life into the industry. Nihalsingha was an accomplished cinematographer as well as an editor: so his films has an input which was special and brought a viewpoint to all his films, most of which focused on the exploited women.\n\nVithanage's film \"Purahanda Kaluwara\" is widely considered one of the best movies made in Sri Lanka as is Jayasundara's \"Sulanga Enu Pinisa\" which won the coveted \"Camera d'Or\" for best first film at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nIn recent years, films have begun to tackle gritty subjects such as family relationships, abortion and results of the conflict between the military and Tamil Tiger rebels in the north. Director Asoka Handagama especially has drawn criticism for pursuing such material in his work.\n\nNumerous websites covering a wide range of topics, in addition to news and current affairs, exists. While all major newspaper have a web presence, many Sri Lankans turn to independent web publishers for their digital media needs.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2134340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2134340", "title": "Schinus terebinthifolia", "text": "Schinus terebinthifolia\n\nSchinus terebinthifolia is a species of flowering plant in the cashew family, Anacardiaceae, that is native to subtropical and tropical South America (southeastern Brazil, northern Argentina, and Paraguay). It is found in these states of Brazil: Alagoas, Bahia, Espírito Santo, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Paraná, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, São Paulo, and Sergipe. Common names include Brazilian peppertree, aroeira, rose pepper, broadleaved pepper tree, wilelaiki (or wililaiki), Christmasberry tree and Florida holly. The species name has been very commonly misspelled as \"\"terebinthifolius\"\", due to considerable historic confusion as to the correct gender of the genus name; as of 2015 this has been resolved with the determination that the correct gender of \"Schinus\" is feminine (rather than masculine), and adjectival names within the genus must be spelled accordingly.\n\nBrazilian peppertree is a sprawling shrub or small tree, with a shallow root system, reaching a height of 7–10 m. The branches can be upright, reclining, or nearly vine-like, all on the same plant. Its plastic morphology allows it to thrive in all kinds of ecosystems: from dunes to swamps, where it grows as a semi-aquatic plant. The leaves are alternate, 10–22 cm long, pinnately compound with (3–) 5–15 leaflets; the leaflets are roughly oval (lanceolate to elliptical), 3–6 cm long and 2–3.5 cm broad, and have finely toothed margins, an acute to rounded apex and yellowish veins. The leaf rachis between the leaflets is usually (but not invariably) slightly winged. The plant is dioecious, with small white flowers borne profusely in axillary clusters. The fruit is a drupe 4–5 mm diameter, carried in dense clusters of hundreds.\n\nThe two varieties are:\nBrazilian pepper is widely grown as an ornamental plant in frost-free regions of South America for its foliage and fruit. It is considered as a melliferous flower and is the main source of food for the bee \"Tetragonisca angustula\", which is an important honey producer.\n\nAlthough it is not a true pepper (\"Piper\"), its dried drupes are often sold as pink peppercorns, as are the fruits from the related species \"Schinus molle\" (Peruvian peppertree). The seeds can be used as a spice, adding a pepper-like taste to food. They are usually sold in a dry state and have a bright pink color. They are less often sold pickled in brine, where they have a dull, almost green hue.\n\nIn the United States, it has been introduced to California, Texas, Hawaii, Arizona, Nevada, Louisiana and Florida. Planted originally as an ornamental outside of its native range, Brazilian pepper has become widespread and is considered an invasive species in many subtropical regions with moderate to high rainfall, including parts or all of Australia, the Bahamas, Bermuda, southern China, Cuba, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Hawaii, Malta, the Marshall Islands, Mauritius, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Norfolk Island, Puerto Rico, Réunion, South Africa and the United States. In drier areas, such as Israel and southern California, it is also grown, but has not generally proved invasive. In California, it is considered invasive in coastal regions by the California Invasive Plant Council.\n\nBrazilian pepper is hard to control because it produces basal shoots if the trunk is cut. Trees also produce abundant seeds that are dispersed by birds and ants. This same hardiness makes the tree highly useful for reforestation in its native environment, but enables it to become invasive outside of its natural range.\n\nLike many other species in the family Anacardiaceae, Brazilian pepper has an aromatic sap that can cause skin reactions (similar to poison ivy burns) in some sensitive people – although the reaction is usually weaker than that induced by touch of the closely related \"Lithraea molleoides\", known in Brazil as \"wild\" aroeira (\"aroeira brava\"). Conversely, \"Schinus terebinthifolia\" is commonly known as \"tame\" aroeira (\"aroeira mansa\").\n\nIn a paper on triterpenes, the ingested fruits are noted to have a “paralyzing effect” on birds. The narcotic and toxic effects on birds and other wildlife has also been noted by others, e.g., Bureau of Aquatic Plant Management. The AMA Handbook of Poisonous and Injurious Plants reports that the triterpenes found in the fruits can result in irritation of the throat, gastroenteritis, diarrhea, and vomiting Like most other members of the Anacardiaceae, Brazilian pepper contains active alkenyl phenols, e.g., urushiol, cardol, which can cause contact dermatitis and inflammation in sensitive individuals. Contact with the “sap” from a cut or bruised tree can result in rash, lesions, oozing sores, severe itching, welts and reddening and swelling (especially of the eyes).\n\nThe burning of plant matter releases many airborne irritants, so it is not an effective means of control. It is said to have a \"mace-like\" effect upon nearby people and is highly advised against.\n\nAlso known as \"Florida holly\", \"Schinus terebinthifolia\" was introduced to Florida by at latest 1891, probably earlier, where it has spread rapidly since about 1940, replacing native plants, like mangroves, with thousands of acres occupied. It is especially adept at colonizing disturbed sites and can grow in both wet and dry conditions. Its growth habit allows it to climb over understory trees and invade mature canopies, forming thickets that choke out most other plants.\n\nThe species, including the seed, is legally prohibited from sale, transport, or planting in Florida, according to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Noxious Weed List. It is classified as a Category I pest by The Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council (FL EPPC). To keep the plant from spreading into native plant communities and displacing them, local regulations and environmental guidelines require eradication of Brazilian pepper wherever possible. The plant and all parts are also illegal for sale or transfer in Texas. As one of the two species sold as pink peppercorn, the other being \"Schinus molle\", it lacks generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status with the FDA.\n\nIt is a declared weed in several states of Australia. In South Africa, it is classified as a category 1 invader in KwaZulu-Natal province, where any plants are to be removed and destroyed, and a category 3 invader in all other provinces, meaning it may no longer be planted.\n\nTwo herbicides are approved for use in the United States to exterminate Brazilian pepper: Triclopyr, using the basal bark method; and glyphosate. Picloram can be used if the stump has been freshly cut, but this is neither the preferred nor most effective means of eradication.\n\nPeppertree is the subject of extensive folk medicinal lore where it is indigenous. Virtually all parts of this tropical tree, including its leaves, bark, fruit, seeds, resin and oleoresin (or balsam) have been used medicinally by indigenous peoples throughout the tropics. The plant has a very long history of use and appears in ancient religious artifacts and on idols among some of the ancient Chilean Amerindians.\n\nThroughout South and Central America, Brazilian peppertree is reported to be an astringent, antibacterial, diuretic, digestive stimulant, tonic, antiviral and wound healer. In Peru, the sap is used as a mild laxative and a diuretic and the entire plant is used externally for fractures and as a topical antiseptic. The oleoresin is used externally as a wound healer, to stop bleeding and for toothaches and it is taken internally for rheumatism and as a purgative. In South Africa, a leaf tea is used to treat colds and a leaf decoction is inhaled for colds, hypertension, depression and irregular heartbeat. In the Brazilian Amazon, a bark tea is used as a laxative and a bark-and-leaf tea is used as a stimulant and antidepressant. In Argentina, a decoction is made with the dried leaves and is taken for menstrual disorders and is also used for respiratory and urinary tract infections and disorders.\n\nBrazilian peppertree is still employed in herbal medicine today in many countries. It is used for many conditions in the tropics, including menstrual disorders, bronchitis, gingivitis, gonorrhea, gout, eye infections, rheumatism, sores, swellings, tuberculosis, ulcers, urethritis, urogenital disorders, venereal diseases, warts and wounds. In Brazilian herbal medicine today, the dried bark and/or leaves are employed for heart problems (hypertension and irregular heart beat), infections of all sorts, menstrual disorders with excessive bleeding, tumors and general inflammation. A liquid extract or tincture prepared with the bark is used internally as a stimulant, tonic and astringent and externally for rheumatism, gout and syphilis.\n\nRecently, the fruit of the plant has been studied and shows promise as a treatment for MRSA. A chemical in the berry appears to stop bacteria from producing a toxin which breaks down tissue. It also appears to suppress the way the bacteria communicate.\n\n"}

Its stated mission is \"to provide forefront scientific facilities, opportunities and leadership essential for discovering the fundamental structure of nuclear matter; to partner in industry to apply its advanced technology; and to serve the nation and its communities through education and public outreach.\"\n\nSince June 1, 2006, it has been operated by Jefferson Science Associates, LLC, a limited liability company created by Southeastern Universities Research Association and PAE Applied Technologies. Until 1996 it was known as the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF); commonly, this name is still used for the main accelerator. Founded in 1984, Jefferson Lab employs more than 750 people, and more than 2,000 scientists from around the world have conducted research using the facility. \n\nThe facility was established in 1984 (first initial funding by DOE, Department of Energy) as the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF); the name was changed to Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in 1996. The full funding for construction was appropriated by US Congress in 1986 and on February 13, 1987, the construction of the main component, the CEBAF accelerator begun. First beam was delivered to experimental area in 1 July 1994. The design energy of 4 GeV for the beam was achieved during the year 1995. The laboratory dedication took place 24 May 1996 (at this event the name was also changed). Full initial operations with all three initial experiment areas online at the design energy was achieved on June 19, 1998. On August 6, 2000 the CEBAF reached \"enhanced design energy\" of 6 GeV. In 2001, plans for an energy upgrade to 12 GeV electron beam and plans to construct a fourth experimental hall area started. The plans progressed through various DOE Critical Decision-stages in the 2000s decade, with the final DOE acceptance in 2008 and the construction on the 12 GeV upgrade beginning in 2009. May 18, 2012 the original 6 GeV CEBAF accelerator shut down for the replacement of the accelerator components for the 12 GeV upgrade. 178 experiments were completed with the original CEBAF.\n\nIn addition to the accelerator, the laboratory has housed and continues to house a free electron laser (FEL) instrument. The construction of the FEL started 11 June 1996. It achieved first light in June 17, 1998. Since then, the FEL has been upgraded numerous times, increasing its power and capabilities substantially.\n\nJefferson Lab was also involved in the construction of the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) in Oak Ridge. Jefferson built the SNS superconducting accelerator and helium refrigeration system. The accelerator components were designed and produced 2000-2005.\n\nThe laboratory's main research facility is the CEBAF accelerator, which consists of a polarized electron source and injector and a pair of superconducting RF linear accelerators that are 7/8-mile (1400 m) in length and connected to each other by two arc sections that contain steering magnets. As the electron beam makes up to five successive orbits, its energy is increased up to a maximum of 6 GeV (the original CEBAF machine worked first in 1995 at the design energy of 4 GeV before reaching \"enhanced design energy\" of 6 Gev in 2000; since then the facility has been upgraded into 12 GeV energy). This leads to a design that appears similar to a racetrack when compared to the classical ring-shaped accelerators found at sites such as CERN or Fermilab. Effectively, CEBAF is a linear accelerator, similar to SLAC at Stanford, that has been folded up to a tenth of its normal length.\n\nThe design of CEBAF allows the electron beam to be continuous rather than the pulsed beam typical of ring shaped accelerators. (There is some beam structure, but the pulses are very much shorter and closer together.) The electron beam is directed onto three potential targets (see below). One of the distinguishing features of Jefferson Lab is the continuous nature of the electron beam, with a bunch length of less than 1 picosecond. Another is Jefferson Lab's use of superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) technology, which uses liquid helium to cool niobium to approximately 4 K (−452.5 °F), removing electrical resistance and allowing the most efficient transfer of energy to an electron. To achieve this, Jefferson Lab houses the world's largest liquid helium refrigerator, and it was one of the first large-scale implementations of SRF technology. The accelerator is built 8 meters below the Earth's surface, or approximately 25 feet, and the walls of the accelerator tunnels are 2 feet thick.\n\nThe beam ends in four experimental halls, labelled Hall A, Hall B, Hall C, and Hall D. Each hall contains specialized spectrometers to record the products of collisions between the electron beam or with real photons and a stationary target. This allows physicists to study the structure of the atomic nucleus, specifically the interaction of the quarks that make up protons and neutrons of the nucleus.\n\nWith each revolution around the accelerator, the beam passes through each of the two LINAC accelerators, but through a different set of bending magnets in semi-circular arcs at the ends of the linacs. The electrons make up to five passes through the linear accelerators.\n\nWhen a nucleus in the target is hit by an electron from the beam, an \"interaction\", or \"event\", occurs, scattering particles into the hall. Each hall contains an array of particle detectors that track the physical properties of the particles produced by the event. The detectors generate electrical pulses that are converted into digital values by analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), time to digital converters (TDCs) and pulse counters (scalers).\n\nThis digital data is gathered and stored so that the physicist can later analyze the data and reconstruct the physics that occurred. The system of electronics and computers that perform this task is called a data acquisition system.\n\n, construction began on a $338 million upgrade to add an end station, Hall D, on the opposite end of the accelerator from the other three halls, as well as to double beam energy to 12 GeV. Concurrently, an addition to the Test Lab, (where the SRF cavities used in CEBAF and other accelerators used worldwide are manufactured) was constructed.\n\n, the upgrade achieved a new record for beam energy, at 10.5 GeV, delivering beam to Hall D.\n\n, the CEBAF accelerator delivered full-energy electrons as part of commissioning activities for the ongoing 12 GeV Upgrade project. Operators of the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility delivered the first batch of 12 GeV electrons (12.065 Giga electron Volts) to its newest experimental hall complex, Hall D.\n\nIn September 2017, the official notification from the DOE of the formal approval of the 12 GeV upgrade project completion and start of operations was issued. By spring 2018, all fours research areas were successfully receiving beam and performing experiments. On 2 May 2018 the CEBAF 12 GeV Upgrade Dedication Ceremony took place.\n\n, the CEBAF accelerator delivered electron beams to all four experimental halls simultaneously for physics-quality production running.\n\nJefferson Lab conducts a broad program of research using the electromagnetic interaction to probe the structure of the nucleon (protons and neutrons), the production and decay of light mesons, and aspects of the interactions of nucleons in the atomic nucleus. The main tools are the scattering of electrons and the creation and utilization of high energy real photons. In addition, both electron and photon beams can be made highly polarized, allowing exploration of so-called spin degrees of freedom in investigations.\n\nThe four experimental halls have distinct but overlapping research goals, but with instrumentation unique to each.\n\nMatching high resolution spectrometers (HRS) have been used to study deep-inelastic electron scattering. Using very well controlled polarized electron beams, parity violation in electron scattering has been studied.\n\nThe CLAS detector was the mainstay of the Hall B experimental program from 1998 to 2012. Physics Working Groups in the areas of Deep-Inelastic Interactions, Hadron Spectroscopy, and Nuclear Interactions exist. See the article related to the spectrometer itself and physics program at the link CLAS. Polarized real photons and electron beams were used. Physics targets included liquid hydrogen and deuterium, as well as massive nuclear materials.\n\nIn the era of 12 GeV beams at Jefferson Lab, the Hall B program has been restructured to include a new detector called CLAS12, as well as several other experiments using more specialized hardware.\n\nMultiple spectrometers and specialized equipment has been used to study, for example, parity-violating electron scattering to measure the weak charge of the proton and hypernuclear production with the electromagnetic interaction.\n\nThis experimental hall was built for the beginning of the 12 GeV beam-energy program starting in 2014. This hall houses the GlueX experiment, which is designed to map out the light unflavored meson spectrum in detail in the search for explicit gluonic excitations in mesons.\n\nJLab houses the world's most powerful tunable free electron laser, with an output of over 14 kilowatts.\n\nSince CEBAF has three complementary experiments running simultaneously, it was decided that the three data acquisition systems should be as similar as possible, so that physicists moving from one experiment to another would find a familiar environment. To that end, a group of specialist physicists was hired to form a data acquisition development group to develop a common system for all three halls. CODA, the CEBAF Online Data Acquisition system, was the result.\n\nCODA is a set of software tools and recommended hardware that facilitates a data acquisition system for nuclear physics experiments. In nuclear and particle physics experiments, the particle tracks are digitized by the data acquisition system, but the detectors are capable of generating a large number of possible measurements, or \"data channels\".\n\nTypically, the ADC, TDC, and other digital electronics are large circuit boards with connectors at the front edge that provide input and output for digital signals, and a connector at the back that plugs into a backplane. A group of boards is plugged into a chassis, or \"crate\", that provides physical support, power, and cooling for the boards and backplane. This arrangement allows electronics capable of digitizing many hundreds of channels to be compressed into a single chassis.\n\nIn the CODA system, each chassis contains a board that is an intelligent controller for the rest of the chassis. This board, called a ReadOut Controller (ROC), configures each of the digitizing boards upon first receiving data, reads the data from the digitizers, and formats the data for later analysis.\n\n\n"}

This is because her late grandfather's best friend (referred to as Ah Kong) had written a will giving her half ownership of a house he had built thanks in part to his success in the seafood business – as well as the fact Ah Kong's life was saved decades before by Lydia's late grandfather.\n\nHowever, when she arrives at the house, it is already occupied by Ah Kong's grandson, Billy B. Ong (Billy Boy Ong), who Lydia calls \"Billy Bong\". Billy prides his rise to the top of the ladder on promoting the company's specialty: fish balls. The presence of Lydia does not sit well with Billy at first but he does give in because it might be the only way to get Lydia to give up her part of the house. Additionally, her dim sum business brings in customers and clients for him.\n\nOther characters include Billy's son Max, an aspiring anime artist, and Rhonda Cheing, Billy's secretary who is trying to pursue Billy and sees Lydia's untimely arrival as a threat to her plans at winning Billy's heart, despite the fact that his wife, who ran out on him, would show up in the third season (Rhonda would later lose interest in Billy in the final season). Another is Sulaiman Yusof, a former stuntman who now works as the maintenance man in Billy's company.\n\nEpisodes of Living with Lydia also aired the United States on The International Channel (later renamed AZN Television) from 2003 to 2004 as part of the \"Asia Street\" lineup. In April 2006, up until the network left the air in 2008, AZN bought the show back and was rerunning them three times a week due to popular demand, starting with the series' fourth and final season. It was also broadcast on TVB Pearl in Hong Kong and Jak TV in Indonesia.\n\nThe 4th season of the series was rebroadcast on Singapore's Channel 5 in 2008 as a tribute to Shum, after her death.\n\nOn April 29, 2008 PMP Entertainment in Malaysia released a DVD collection containing all 52 episodes, which includes subtitles in Chinese, in Region 3-formatted countries. Although the DVDs are out of print, PMP is expected to re-issue the DVDs when it becomes available.\n\nThis is an incomplete list of running gags used in the show.\n\nThe most noticeable and common gag during the show's run, Lydia always calls Billy B. Ong as Billy Bong.\n\nBilly B. Ong often talks to a picture of his grandfather on the wall, referring to him as \"Ah Kong\" usually blaming him for some reason. This is seen in many episodes but most noticeably the first episode of the show.\n\nBilly B. Ong likes to shorten the word \"fishballs\" to \"balls\" occasionally when talking. Since balls is also slang for testicles, the characters of the show often say the word in a comical context, such as, \"Billy Bong, can I taste one of your balls?\"\n\nLydia repeatedly yells \"Shut up!\" or \"Stop!\" to stop the three children in the house from doing something. However, the children always carry on after she has left.\n\nThe entire opening sequence is animated. It starts in black and white with Billy B. Ong playing a song on the piano (\"Humoresque\", the series' theme song), followed by another clip of him eating a fishball. Billy then tries to push a fishball into his son Max, followed by a clip of Ronda brushing her hair and then moving closer to Billy. The song then stops, and a loud sound clip of Lydia shouting \"Hi, Billy Bong\" is heard. Lydia and her family then appear and fill the screen with color. Apple and Jordan then appear, and then some final shots with the entire cast of the show, before an animated Lydia appears again beside the show's title on an orange screen and laughs.\n\nThe series was nominated in two categories at the 2003 Asian Television Awards, in which \"Living With Lydia\" was up for \"Best Comedy Programme\" and \"Best Comedy Performance by an Actress\" for Sum for her hilarious portrayal of the series' feisty title character. Sum won in the latter category and it was the show's only win at the event .\n\nDuring the series run, there were rumors that Shum and Chong were dating off camera, but given that Shum was 11 years older than Chong, both denied this, saying that they were friends.\n\nIn 2009, Galloping Films, an Australian-based television and film distribution company, acquired the international rights to MediaCorp-produced programs, including \"Living with Lydia,\" for syndication outside of Singapore.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2134362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2134362", "title": "American pika", "text": "American pika\n\nThe American pika (\"Ochotona princeps\"), a diurnal species of pika, is found in the mountains of western North America, usually in boulder fields at or above the tree line. They are herbivorous, smaller relatives of rabbits and hares.\n\nThe American pika, known in the 19th century as the \"little tiny hare\", has a small, round, ovate body. Their body length ranges from . Their hind feet range from 25 to 35 mm (1–1½ in). They usually weigh about . Body size can vary among populations. In populations with sexual dimorphism, males are slightly larger than females.\n\nThe American pika is intermediate in size among pikas. The hind legs of the pika do not seem to be much longer than its front legs and its hind feet are relatively short when compared to most other lagomorphs. It has densely furred soles on its feet except for black pads at the ends of the toes. The ears are moderately large and suborbicular and are hairy on both surfaces, normally dark with white margins. The pika's \"buried\" tail is longer relative to body size compared to other lagomorphs. It has a slightly rounded skull with a broad and flat preorbital region. The fur color of the pika is the same for both sexes, but varies by subspecies and season. The dorsal fur of the pika ranges from grayish to cinnamon-brown, often colored with tawny or orchraceous hues, during the summer. During winter, the fur becomes grayer and longer. The dense underfur is usually slate-gray or lead-colored. It also has whitish ventral fur.\nMales are called bucks and females are called does like rabbits.\n\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California and New Mexico. Out of the 30 existing species of pika, it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika (\"Ochotona collaris\"). In relation to the distribution of the American pika, the collared pika is located farther north of those regions and is separated by a gap of about extending across British Columbia and Alberta.\n\nPikas inhabit talus fields that are fringed by suitable vegetation on alpine areas. They also live in piles of broken rock. Sometimes, they live in man-made substrate such as mine tailings and piles of scrap lumber. Pikas usually have their den and nest sites below rock around 0.2–1 m in diameter but often sit on larger and more prominent rocks. They generally reside in scree near or above the tree line. Pikas are restricted to cool moist microhabitats on high peaks or watercourses. Intolerant of high diurnal temperatures, in the northern portion of their range they may be found near sea level, but in the south they are rare below . Pikas rely on existing spaces in the talus for homes and do not dig burrows. However, they can enlarge their home by digging.\n\nThe American pika is a generalist herbivore. It eats a large variety of green plants, including different kinds of grasses, sedges, thistles and fireweed. Although pikas can meet their water demands from the vegetation they eat, they do drink water if it is available in their environment. Pikas have two different ways of foraging: they directly consume food (feeding) or they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying). The pika feeds throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer months. Since they do not hibernate, pikas have greater energy demands than other montane mammals. They also make 13 trips per hour to collect vegetation when haying, up to a little over 100 trips per day. It seems that the timing of haying correlates to the amount of precipitation from the previous winter. Pikas start and then quit haying earlier in years following little snow and early spring. In areas at lower elevations, haying begins before the snow has melted at high altitudes; while at higher elevations, haying continues after it ends in lower elevations.\n\nWhen haying, pikas harvest plants in a deliberate sequence, corresponding to their seasonal phenology. They seem to assess the nutritional value of available food and harvest accordingly. Pikas select plants that have the higher caloric, protein, lipid and water content. Forbs and tall grass tend to be hayed more than eaten directly. Haypiles tend to be stored under the talus near the talus-meadow interface although they may be constructed on the talus surface. Males generally store more vegetation than females and adults usually store more than juveniles. Pikas deposit two kinds of fecal droppings: Hard brown round pellets and caecal pellets that are soft black shiny strings that form in the caecum. Caecal pellets have more energy value than stored plant food and the pika may consume them directly or store them for later.\n\nAmerican pikas are diurnal. The total area of land which an American pika uses is known as a home range. Approximately 55% of its home range is territory which the pika defends against intruders. Territory size can vary from 410–709 m² and is dependent on configuration, distance to vegetation and quality of vegetation. The home ranges of pika may overlap with the distances of the home ranges of a mating pair being shorter than that of the nearest neighbors of the same sex. Spatial distances between adults of a pair is greatest during early and mid summer and reduces during late summer and early autumn. Pikas defend their territories with aggression. Actual aggressive encounters are rare and usually occur between members of the same sex and those unfamiliar with each other. A pika may intrude on another’s territory but usually when the resident is not active. During haying, territorial behavior increases.\n\nAdult pikas of the opposite sex with territories adjacent form mated pairs. When there is more than one male available, females will exhibit mate choice. Pikas are reflex ovulators, that is ovulation only occurs after copulation, and they are also seasonally polyestrous. A female has two litters per year and these litters average three young each. Breeding takes place one month before the snow melts and gestation lasts approximately 30 days. Parturition occurs as early as March in lower elevations but occurs from April to June at higher elevations. Lactation significantly reduces a female's fat reserves and they only nurse the second litter if the first does not survive, despite exhibiting postpartum estrus. Pikas are born slightly altricial, being blind, slightly haired, and having fully erupted teeth. They weigh between 10 and 12 grams at birth. At around nine days, they are able to open their eyes. Mothers forage most of the day and return to the nest once every two hours to nurse the young. Young become independent after four weeks, around the same time they are weaned. Young may remain in their natal or an adjoining home range. When in their home range, young occupy areas away from their relatives as much as possible. Dispersal appears to be caused by competition for territories.\n\nPikas are vocal, using both calls and songs to communicate among themselves. A call is used to warn when a predator is lurking nearby, and a song is used during the breeding season (males only), and during autumn (both males and females). Predators of the pika include eagles, hawks, coyotes, bobcats, foxes, and weasels.\n\nThe American Pika was described in the scientific literature by John Richardson in \"Fauna Boreali-Americana\" in 1828. The original scientific name was \"Lepus (Lagomys) princeps\".\n\nAs they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems for detecting global warming in the western United States. Temperature increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. American pikas, however, cannot easily migrate in response to climate change, as their habitat is currently restricted to small, disconnected habitat \"islands\" in numerous mountain ranges. Pikas can die in six hours when exposed to temperatures above if individuals cannot find refuge from heat. In warmer environments, such as during midday sun and at lower\nelevation limits, pikas typically become inactive and withdraw into cooler talus openings. Because of behavioral adaptation, American pikas also persist in the hot climates of Craters of the Moon and Lava Beds National Monuments (Idaho and California, respectively). Average and extreme maximum surface temperatures in August at these sites are , respectively.\n\nRecent studies suggest some populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming. A 2003 study, published in the \"Journal of Mammalogy\", showed nine of 25 sampled populations of American pika had disappeared in the Great Basin, leading biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as a whole is vulnerable.\n\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act; in the IUCN Red List it is still considered a Species of Least Concern.\n\nThe Pikas in Peril Project, funded through the National Park Service Climate Change Response Program, began data collection in May 2010. A large team of academic researchers and National Park Service staff - from three universities and eight national parks - worked together to address questions regarding the vulnerability of the American pika to future climate change scenarios projected for the western United States. The project concluded in 2016.\n\n"}

{"id": "2134376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2134376", "title": "The Boxer (The Chemical Brothers song)", "text": "The Boxer (The Chemical Brothers song)\n\n\"The Boxer\" is a song recorded by English electronic music duo The Chemical Brothers for their fifth studio album \"Push the Button\" (2005). It served as the album's third single in the United Kingdom and Europe, released by Virgin Records and Freestyle Dust, and as the second single in the United States via Astralwerks. The song is a psychedelic pop track which features The Charlatans' lead singer Tim Burgess on vocals and as a co-writer. This is the second collaboration between Burgess and the duo, following \"Life is Sweet\", which was released 10 years earlier.\n\nHowever, it received mixed reviews from music critics who, while praising its production, criticised Burgess' vocals. \"The Boxer\" was the first single by The Chemical Brothers not to reach the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, reaching only number 41. Elsewhere, it charted in Spain, Ireland and on the US Dance Singles Sales chart. Burgess and the duo later performed the track at the BBC Radio 2 Electric Proms in 2007.\n\nThe song's music video was directed by director duo Ne-o and shot in Budapest, Hungary. The visual, which features a basketball bouncing around the streets with its owner running to catch it, drew comparisons with the 1956 short film \"The Red Balloon\". A video for an alternate version of the song was directed by Adam Smith and donated to the charity group Good for Nothing's 50/50 Make or Break campaign in 2011. It was also remixed by DFA, whose version received much acclaim from critics.\n\nWhen The Chemical Brothers started to write music again after finishing the album \"Come with Us\" (2002), \"The Boxer\" was one of the earliest tracks they composed for their next album, \"Push the Button\" (2005). The Charlatans lead singer Tim Burgess, who had collaborated on the duo's debut album track \"Life Is Sweet\" 10 years earlier, contributed the song's vocals. According to the group, of all their collaborators, Burgess remained a close friend. They shared that, \"If he's in London, we would probably have a drink together, three of us, or, you know, when we're in Los Angeles, he will come to our gig.\"\n\nOriginally, the song's chorus was \"set in stone,\" but The Chemical Brothers asked Burgess to sing it and write some additional lyrics. They also wanted him to sing the vocals at the end of the track—lyrics like \"I'm a hustler, I'm a tiger\"—in the same vocal style he used earlier in his career, which Burgess himself described as \"weedy and soft\". The duo said that the resulting vocal sounds very different from the one on their previous collaboration. \"The Guardian\"s Alexis Petridis described it as having a \"standard-issue mid-Atlannick accent\".\n\nAstralwerks released a statement describing the song as a combination of the duo's signature psychedelic pop sound and \"modern stabs\". Its production was built on a \"ramshackle\", slightly off-tempo piano sample set above a looping mid-tempo rhythm. \"PopMatters\" Tim O'Neil described it as \"syncopated\" and \"slightly light-headed\". He also noted the duo's different style on the track compared with their previous records. Scott Plagenhoef of \"Pitchfork Media\" commented that the song along with \"Galvanize\" reminded him of the duo's \"early B-Boy/techno days\".\n\nOn 11 July 2005, the song was released in various formats in Europe and the United Kingdom as \"Push the Button\"s third single. These included: a CD single for both markets featuring an edited version of the track and a previously unreleased song \"Swiper\"; a Europe-only maxi single containing the original \"The Boxer\", the DFA version and a live rendition of \"Believe\" at the Mediolanum Forum; a UK maxi-enhanced single with the same tracklist and an additional music video for its title track; and a UK 12\" single containing the original, the DFA version and \"Swiper\".\n\nA day later, the CD and the 12\" single were released in the United States as the album's second single; both were expanded to EPs featuring an extended version of the song, two previous Europe and UK only-released B-sides \"Giant\" and \"Spring\", with remixes from DFA, Mathew Jonson, Erol Alkan and Abe Duque. This EP, with the inclusion of the track \"Swiper\", was also available for digital download exclusively in the US. Outside the US, a radio edit of \"The Boxer\" and its edited DFA version were released digitally as individual singles. On 25 October 2007, Burgess and the duo performed the song live at the BBC Radio 2 Electric Proms at The Roundhouse in Camden, London.\n\nThe DFA version, mixed by British DJ Tim Goldsworthy and LCD Soundsystems member, American musician James Murphy, was later added to their remix album \"The DFA Remixes: Chapter One\" (2006). This remix received much praise from critics, with \"Billboard\"s Kerri Mason singling it out as \"the soundtrack to a 20-something hipster walking the downtown streets, iPod in pocket\" that also \"sounds like a Paradise Garage-era Peter Brown record\". Tim Finney from \"Pitchfork\" highly praised the \"Pearsonesque remix\" as the \"synth-laden Balearic house number that shimmers with unabashed gorgeousness\". Along with another lengthy song on the album, the remix for Hot Chips \"(Just Like We) Breakdown\", both were said in a review by Zeth Lundy of \"PopMatters\" to \"unfold with a delicate subtext manufactured by the slow-building minimalism—they're patient dedications to the mutability of the groove, never boring and always fascinating to experience\". \"musicOMH\"s Tom Woods said that \"a wealth of percussive techniques\" keeps things \"fresh and interesting\", but criticised its length which made the song become a \"stretch\". He added that, \"vocal use is less dominant here, which gives Murphy a chance to demonstrate a clear talent for sculpting dynamic synth-led beats\".\n\nIn a review for \"PopMatters\", music critic Tim O'Neil called the song \"an odd track\" that sounded like nothing he'd heard before. He continued: \"I wouldn't be surprised if it was the next single [after \"Galvanize\"], because its [\"sic\"] not the kind of track you forget.\" John Bush of AllMusic listed the track as one of his albums track picks, while Michaelangelo Matos of \"Spin\" called it one of the album's best moments—one that was \"less about the successive climaxes than steady-state flow\". Jack Smith of BBC Music described the song as \"cutting edge\" and \"hook-laden\", also highlighted it as \"a welcome return\" for Burgess.\n\nHowever, \"The Guardian\"s review by Alexis Petridis was very negative. She criticised Burgess' vocal styling as \"the Awful Falsetto\", saying that \"not even a mass of special effects can stop Burgess' shortcomings shining through\", and calling the track one of the album's new ideas that \"flop[ped]\". Similarly, Matt D'Cruz of \"Drowned in Sound\" also criticised Burgess' \"strained\" vocal, calling it \"a poor fit for the Chems' stuttering rave pianos and ponderous beats\". Scott Plagenhoef of \"Pitchfork Media\" remarked on the \"unremarkable verses and nasally vocals\", although the song, along with \"Galvanize\", reminded him of the duo's \"early B-Boy/techno days\". He felt both songs were missing the ferocity and sub-bass rattlings of their \"earlier cousins\". The latter song was also said by Plagenhoef to be \"far better\". Another negative review came from \"Slant Magazine\", where journalist Eric Henderson called the track one of the album's \"unsuccessful interpolations of UK grime\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the duo's home country, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at its peak, number 41, in the week ending 23 July 2005. It was their first single not to chart in the top 40. It dropped to number 65 in its second week and moved to number 90 for a week before disappearing from the chart. \"The Boxer\" made its debut at number 36 on the Irish Singles Chart in the week ending of 14 July before dropping to number 44 in its final week. It had a one-week stay on the Spanish Albums Chart at number 17 in the week of 31 July, and at number 15 on \"Billboard\"s US Hot Dance Singles Sales chart in the 30 July issue.\n\nLondon-based director duo Ne-o, Jake Knight and Ryoko Tanaka, directed the music video for \"The Boxer\". They were on holiday in Hong Kong and were sent a track with DRM which Knight said made it frustrating to play through dial-up connection. Tanaka eventually came up with the idea of a ball that \"connected through things\". Knight did not quite understand the idea at first, but through a process of miscommunication, they wrote the video's treatment about \"a crazy basketball\" which was the quickest treatment they had ever written at the time.\n\nThe video was then filmed in Budapest, Hungary, over several days. Knight said: \"The reason for the location stems from the music in the actual video. The ball needs to bounce synchronized with the 16th or 8th beat in the track. To do that, we needed a space with equidistant or closed surfaces to bounce around. A roof low to the floor but with uprights. Obviously parking lots are ideal. But it was a technical reason that made us go with it.\" Ne-o used an Arri Super 16mm film camera to shoot the film, then edited it in Adobe Premiere Pro, with 3D animation using Autodesk Softimage.\n\nWriting in his book \"Reinventing Music Video: Next-generation Directors, Their Inspiration, and Work\", British author-director Matt Hanson claimed some might call the video the duo's first action sequence and stated it could be considered \"a high-octane version\" of Albert Lamorisses short film \"The Red Balloon\". He wrote: \"While [the short] was a poetic 1956 study of a boy befriended by a balloon, here the action is reversed and revved up, with the basketball defiantly trying to bounce away from the city street kid.\"\n\nThe video opens with a boy with a basketball in his bag walking out of a car park. The basketball then begins to bounce out of the bag, jumps out of the city streets and gets into a Lada taxi. After that, it continues to bounce and causes troubles in an office. Its owner struggles to chase the ball but then manages to catch it for a second. Unfortunately, the ball escapes and is run over by a truck driven by The Chemical Brothers. The basketball re-inflates after the accident, jumps into and eventually gets trapped inside an old phone booth near Baross Street, swells to an enormous size, and explodes.\n\nLater in 2011, The Chemical Brothers and director Adam Smith (credited as Flat Nose George) donated the visual of an alternate version of the song entitled \"50/50 Mix\", in support of the 50/50 Make or Break campaign. 50/50 Make or Break was a fundraising project aimed at raising money for East Africa, created by UK-based charity group Good for Nothing.\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from the CD single liner notes.\n\n"}

He was best known for his highly detailed paintings of hamburger stands, pick-up trucks, and California banks, portrayed in a deliberately objective manner.\n\nGoings was born to a working-class family in Corning, California and grew up during the Great Depression. He was exposed to art and painting in a freshman high-school art class, and inspired by his discovery of Rembrandt at his local library. His aunt encouraged him to draw, and bought him books and instructional materials. He began painting using paint from the local hardware store, and old bed sheets when canvas was unavailable.\n\nAfter he served in the military, he enrolled in Hartnell College, in Salinas, California and was approached and encouraged to attend art school by Leon Amyx, who was the head of the art department at Hartnell at that time and a well-known painter.\nGoings studied art at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland. During his studies at California College of the Arts, he studied along other painters from the Photorealist Movement including Robert Bechtle and Richard Mclean as well as other artists including Nathan Oliveira\nHe received his MFA in painting from Sacramento State College in 1965.\n\nHe was inspired by artists such as Wayne Thiebaud, Johannes Vermeer, Thomas Eakins. His interest in Photorealism sparked after being thoroughly disappointed with the quality of the pop art imagery at the time, he felt that if something was to represent an object then why not make it resemble a photograph as closely as possible.\n\nGoings helped to define the Photorealist Movement along with Robert Bechtle, Robert Cottingham, Audrey Flack, Don Eddy, and Richard Estes.\n\n\"In 1963 I wanted to start painting again but I decided I wasn't going to do abstract pictures\". It occurred to me that I should go as far to the opposite as I could. ... It occurred to me that projecting and tracing the photograph instead of copying it freehand would be even more shocking. To copy a photograph literally was considered a bad thing to do. It went against all of my art school training... some people were upset by what I was doing and said 'it's not art, it can't possibly be art'. That gave me encouragement in a perverse way, because I was delighted to be doing something that was really upsetting people... I was having a hell of a lot of fun...\" (edited quote from Realists at Work) \n\n"}

Radio broadcasting, like other forms of media in Sri Lanka, is generally divided along linguistic lines with state and private media operators providing services in Sinhala, Tamil, and English language.\n\nThe first radio broadcast in Ceylon was in 1923 when recorded music was broadcast using parts of radio equipment from a captured German submarine. Regular broadcasting started in Colombo in July 1924. Ceylon's first radio station Radio Colombo started regular broadcasting on 16 December 1925. The station was taken over by the British military during World War II who renamed the station Radio SEAC which broadcast across South Asia from October 1944. After the war the station was handed back to the civilian government of Ceylon who renamed it Radio Ceylon on 1 October 1949. The station was immensely popular both in Ceylon and other parts of Asia.\n\nThe Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation Act No. 37 of 1966 incorporated the Department of Broadcasting. Radio Ceylon became a public corporation on 30 September 1967, changing its name to Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Ceylon was renamed Sri Lanka in 1972 after becoming a republic and consequently CBC was renamed Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC).\n\nSLBC broadcast on medium wave until 1993 when FM broadcasting began. 95% of the country received FM transmissions by 1999. The government maintained a monopoly on radio broadcasting until the early 1990s when private radio stations were allowed to broadcast. Today there are numerous private radio stations but the state-owned stations continue to dominate the market.\n\nThe following is a list of radio stations based in Sri Lanka.\n\nSeveral international broadcasters operate radio stations aimed at Sri Lankan audiences but broadcasting from outside Sri Lanka:\n\nSome broadcasters use local transmitters to relay their broadcasts.

{"id": "2134398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2134398", "title": "Panel painting", "text": "Panel painting\n\nA panel painting is a painting made on a flat panel made of wood, either a single piece, or a number of pieces joined together. Until canvas became the more popular support medium in the 16th century, it was the normal form of support for a painting not on a wall (fresco) or vellum, which was used for miniatures in illuminated manuscripts and paintings for the framing.\n\nPanel painting is very old; it was a very prestigious medium in Greece and Rome, but only very few examples of ancient panel paintings have survived. A series of 6th century BC painted tablets from Pitsa (Greece) represent the oldest surviving Greek panel paintings. Most classical Greek paintings that were famous in their day seem to have been of a size comparable to smaller modern works – perhaps up to a half-length portrait size. However, for a generation in the second quarter of the fifth-century BC there was a movement, called the \"new painting\" and led by Polygnotus, for very large painted friezes, apparently painted on wood, decorating the interiors of public buildings with very large and complicated subjects containing numerous figures at least half life-size, and including battle scenes. We can only attempt to imagine what these looked like from some detailed literary descriptions and vase-paintings that appear to echo their compositions. The first century BC to third century AD Fayum mummy portraits, preserved in the exceptionally dry conditions of Egypt, provide the bulk of surviving panel painting from the Imperial Roman period – about 900 face or bust portraits survive. The Severan Tondo, also from Egypt (about 200AD) is one of the handful of non-funerary Graeco-Roman specimens to survive. Wood has always been the normal support for the Icons of Byzantine art and the later Orthodox traditions, the earliest of which (all in Saint Catherine's Monastery) date from the 5th or 6th centuries, and are the oldest panel paintings which seem to be of the highest contemporary quality. Encaustic and tempera are the two techniques used in antiquity. Encaustic largely ceased to be used after the early Byzantine icons.\n\nAlthough there seem from literary references to have been some panel paintings produced in Western Europe through the centuries between Late Antiquity and the Romanesque period, and Byzantine icons were imported, there are next to no survivals in an unaltered state. In the 12th century panel painting experienced a revival because of new liturgical practices—the priest and congregation were now on the same side of the altar, leaving the space behind the altar free for the display of a holy image—and thus altar decorations were in demand. The earliest forms of panel painting were dossals (altar backs), altar fronts and crucifixes. All were painted with religious images, commonly the Christ or the Virgin, with the saints appropriate to the dedication of the church, and the local town or diocese, or to the donor. Donor portraits including members of the donor's family are also often shown, usually kneeling to the side. They were for some time a cheaper alternative to the far more prestigious equivalents in metalwork, decorated with gems, enamels, and perhaps ivory figures, most of which have long been broken up for their valuable materials. Painted panels for altars are most numerous in Spain, especially Catalonia, which is explained by the poverty of the country at this time, as well as the lack of Reformation iconoclasm.\n\nThe 13th and 14th centuries in Italy were a great period of panel painting, mostly altarpieces or other religious works. However, it is estimated that of all the panel paintings produced there, 99.9 percent have been lost. The vast majority of Early Netherlandish paintings are on panel, and these include most of the earliest portraits, such as those by Jan van Eyck, and some other secular scenes. However, one of the earliest surviving oils on canvas is a French \"Madonna with angels\" of about 1410 in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, which is very early indeed for oil painting also. In these works the frame and panel are sometimes a single piece of wood, as with Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?) by van Eyck (National Gallery, London), where the frame was also painted, including an inscription done illusionistically to resemble carving.\n\nBy the 15th century with the increased wealth of Europe, and later the appearance of humanism, and a changing attitude about the function of art and patronage, panel painting went in new directions. Secular art opened the way to the creation of chests, painted beds, birth trays and other furniture. Many such works are now detached and hung framed on walls in museums. Many double-sided wings of altarpieces (see picture at top) have also been sawn into two one-sided panels.\n\nCanvas took over from panel in Italy by the first half of the 16th century, a change led by Mantegna and the artists of Venice (which made the finest canvas at this point, for sails). In the Netherlands the change took about a century longer, and panel paintings remained common, especially in Northern Europe, even after the cheaper and more portable canvas had become the main support medium. The young Rubens and many other painters preferred it for the greater precision that could be achieved with a totally solid support, and many of his most important works also used it, even for paintings over four metres long in one dimension. His panels are of notoriously complicated construction, containing as many as seventeen pieces of wood (\"Het Steen\", National Gallery, London). For smaller cabinet paintings, copper sheets (often old printmaking plates) were another rival support, from the end of the 16th century, used by many artists including Adam Elsheimer. Many Dutch painters of the Golden Age used panel for their small works, including Rembrandt on occasion. By the 18th century it had become unusual to paint on panel, except for small works to be inset into furniture, and the like. But, for example, The National Gallery in London has two Goya portraits on panel.\n\nMany other painting traditions also painted, and still paint, on wood, but the term is usually only used to refer to the Western tradition described above.\n\nThe technique is known to us through Cennino Cennini's \"The Craftsman's Handbook\" (\"Il libro dell' arte\") published in 1390, and other sources. It changed little over the centuries. It was a laborious and painstaking process:\n\nOnce the panel construction was complete, the design was laid out, usually in charcoal.\n\nThe usual ancient painting technique was encaustic, used at Al-Fayum and in the earliest surviving Byzantine icons, which are at the Saint Catherine's Monastery. This uses heated wax as the medium for the pigments.\n\nThis was replaced before the end of first millennium by tempera, which uses an egg-yolk medium. Using small brushes dipped in a mixture of pigment and egg-yolk, the paint was applied in very small, almost transparent, brushstrokes. Thin layers of paint would be used to create volumetric forms.\n\nBy the beginning of the 15th century, oil painting was developed. This was more tolerant, and allowed the exceptional detail of Early Netherlandish art. This used a very painstaking multi-layered technique, where the painting, or a particular part of it, had to be left for a couple of days for one layer to dry before the next was applied.\n\nWood panels, especially if kept with too little humidity, often warp and crack with age, and from the 19th century, when reliable techniques were developed, many have been transferred to canvas or modern board supports.\n\nWood panel is now rather more useful to art historians than canvas, and in recent decades there has been great progress in extracting this information. Many fakes have been discovered and mistaken datings corrected. Specialists can identify the tree species used, which varied according to the area where the painting was made. Carbon-dating techniques can give an approximate date-range (typically to about a range of about 20 years), and dendrochronology sequences have been developed for the main source areas of timber for panels. Italian paintings used local or sometimes Dalmatian wood, most often poplar, but including chestnut, walnut, oak and other woods. The Netherlands ran short of local timber early in the 15th century, and most Early Netherlandish masterpieces are Baltic oak, often Polish, cut north of Warsaw and shipped down the Vistula, across the Baltic to the Netherlands. Southern German painters often used pine, and mahogany imported into Europe was used by later painters, including examples by Rembrandt and Goya.\n\nIn theory, dendro-chronology gives an exact felling date, but in practice allowances have to be made for a seasoning period of several years, and a small panel may be from the centre of the tree, with no way of knowing how many rings outside the panel there were. So dendro-chronological conclusions tend to be expressed as a \"terminus post quem\" or an earliest possible date, with a tentative estimate of an actual date, that may be twenty or more years later.\n\nThe so-called \"Panel Paintings Initiative\" is a multi-year project in collaboration between the Getty Conservation Institute, the Getty Foundation, and the J. Paul Getty Museum. The Panel Paintings Initiative is a response to the growing recognition that significant collections of paintings on wood panels may be at risk in coming decades due to the waning numbers of conservators and craftspeople with the highly specialized skills required for the conservation of these complex works of art.\n\nArtists would typically use wood native to the region. Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528), for example, painted on poplar when he was in Venice and on oak when in the Netherlands and southern Germany. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) used oak for his paintings in France; Hans Baldung Grien (1484/5–1545) and Hans Holbein (1497/8–1543) used oak while working in southern Germany and England. In the Middle Ages, spruce and lime were used in the Upper Rhine and often in Bavaria. Outside of the Rhineland, softwood (such as pinewood) was mainly used. Of a group of twenty Norwegian altar frontals from the Gothic period (1250–1350) fourteen were made of fir, two of oak, and four of pine (Kaland 1982). Large altars made in Denmark during the fifteenth century used oak for the figures as well as for the painted wings. Lime was popular with Albrecht Altdorfer (ca. 1480–1538), Baldung Grien, Christoph Amberger (d. 1562), Dürer, and Lucas Cranach the Elder (1472–1553). Cranach often used beech wood—an unusual choice. In Northern Europe, poplar is very rarely found, but walnut and chestnut are not uncommon. In the northeast and south, coniferous trees such as spruce, and various types of fir, and pine have been used. Fir wood is shown to have been used in the Upper and Middle Rhine, Augsburg, Nuremberg, and Saxony. Pinewood was used mainly in Tirol and beech wood only in Saxony. However, in general, oak was the most common substrate used for panel making in the Low Countries, northern Germany, and the Rhineland around Cologne. In France, until the seventeenth century, most panels were made from oak, although a few made of walnut and poplar have been found.\n\nThe oak favored as a support by the painters of the northern school was, however, not always of local origin. In the seventeenth century about four thousand full-grown oak trees were needed to build a medium-sized merchant ship; thus, imported wood was necessary. Oak coming from Königsberg as well as Gdańsk is often found among works by Flemish and Dutch artists from the 15th through the 17th centuries; the origin can be established by the patterns of growth rings. In the last decade of the seventeenth century, Wilhelmus Beurs, a Dutch writer on painting techniques, considered oak to be the most useful wooden substrate on which to paint. However, exceptions are seen rather early in the seventeenth century: sometimes walnut, pearwood, cedarwood, or Indian woods were used. Mahogany was already in use by a number of painters during the first decades of the seventeenth century and was used often in the Netherlands in the nineteenth century. Even so, when canvas or copper was not used, the main oeuvre of the northern school was painted on oak panels.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was abolished at the redistribution of 21 November 1968. For its entire existence, it was a very safe Labor seat.

{"id": "2134402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2134402", "title": "Microeconomic reform", "text": "Microeconomic reform\n\nMicroeconomic reform (or often just economic reform) comprises policies directed to achieve improvements in economic efficiency, either by eliminating or reducing distortions in individual sectors of the economy or by reforming economy-wide policies such as tax policy and competition policy with an emphasis on economic efficiency, rather than other goals such as equity or employment growth.\n\n\"Economic reform\" usually refers to deregulation, or at times to reduction in the size of government, to remove distortions caused by regulations or the presence of government, rather than new or increased regulations or government programs to reduce distortions caused by market failure. As such, these reform policies are in the tradition of laissez faire, emphasizing the distortions caused by government, rather than in ordoliberalism, which emphasizes the need for state regulation to maximize efficiency.\n\nMicroeconomic reform dominated Australian economic policy from the early 1980s until the end of the 20th century. The beginning of microeconomic reform is commonly dated to the floating of the Australian dollar in 1983. The last major policy initiatives associated with the microeconomic reform agenda was the package of tax reforms centered on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) which came into force in July 2000, and the privatization of Telstra which began in 1998 and was completed in 2006.\n\nThere were, however, some instances of microeconomic reform before the 1980s, notably including the Whitlam government’s 25 percent tariff cut. Similarly, the consequences of some microeconomic reforms initiated in the 1990s, such as National Competition Policy are still being worked through.\n\nThe policy agenda associated with microeconomic reform included:\n\nThe Chinese economic reform () refers to the program of economic changes called \"Socialism with Chinese characteristics\" in the People's Republic of China (PRC) that were started in 1978 by pragmatists within the Communist Party of China (CPC) led by Deng Xiaoping and are ongoing as of the early 21st century. The goal of Chinese economic reform was to generate sufficient surplus value to finance the modernization of the mainland Chinese economy. Neither the socialist command economy, favored by CPC conservatives, nor the Maoist attempt at a Great Leap Forward from socialism to communism in China's agriculture (with the commune system) had generated sufficient surplus value for these purposes. The initial challenge of economic reform was to solve the problems of motivating workers and farmers to produce a larger surplus and to eliminate economic imbalances that were common in command economies. Economic reforms started since 1978 have helped lift millions of people out of poverty, bringing the poverty rate down from 53% of the population in 1981 to 8% by 2001...\n\nThe economic liberalization of 1991, initiated by then Indian prime minister P. V. Narasimha Rao and his finance minister Manmohan Singh, did away with investment, industrial and import licensing and ended many public monopolies, allowing automatic approval of foreign direct investment in many sectors. Since then, the overall direction of liberalization has remained the same, irrespective of the ruling party, although no party has yet tried to take on powerful lobbies such as the trade unions and farmers, or contentious issues such as reforming labor laws and reducing agricultural subsidies.\n\nThe effect of these reforms has been positive, and since 1990, India has had high growth rates and has emerged as one of the wealthiest economies in the developing world. During this period, the economy has grown constantly with only a few major setbacks. This has been accompanied by increases in life expectancy, literacy rates, and food security since then.\n\nAfter the snap election of 1984 in New Zealand, the new Finance Minister, Roger Douglas, began a speedy reform of the New Zealand economy. The speed of the reforms can be partially attributed to the currency crisis that resulted from the former government's refusal to devalue the New Zealand dollar.\n\nThe policies included cutting subsidies and trade barriers, privatising public assets and the control of inflation through measures rooted in monetarism. These policies were regarded in some quarters of Douglas's New Zealand Labour Party as a betrayal of traditional Labour ideals. The Labour Party subsequently retreated from these policies, but it became the core doctrine of the New Zealand ACT party.\n\nThe reforms created a very business-friendly regulatory framework. A 2008 study ranked New Zealand 99.9% in \"Business freedom\", and 80% overall in \"Economic freedom\", noting amongst other things that it only takes 12 days to establish a business in New Zealand on average, compared with a worldwide average of 43 days. Other indicators measured were property rights, labor market conditions, government controls and corruption, the last being considered \"next to non-existent\" in the Heritage Foundation and \"Wall Street Journal\" study.\n\nEconomic reforms began in the Soviet Union when Perestroika was introduced in June 1985 by the then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Its literal meaning is \"restructuring\", referring to the restructuring of the Soviet economy.\n\nDuring the initial period (1985–1987) of Mikhail Gorbachev's time in power, he talked about modifying central planning, but did not make any truly fundamental changes (\"uskoreniye\", acceleration). Gorbachev and his team of economic advisers then introduced more fundamental reforms, which became known as \"perestroika\" (economic restructuring).\n\nEconomic reform began in Africa throughout Africa in the mid-1990s. Before that, the two decades of donor-sponsored reform efforts to Africa failed to help most sub-Saharan economies to overcome the fiscal and balance of payments deficits. During the mid-1990s, several civil wars ended and a wave of democratization started. The growth rate reached 1.2 percent a year between 1994 and 1997 which is the highest rate during that generation. However, the growth is a result of a donor-led process of structural adjustment as compatible with the survival of the status quo. The growth rate started to decline after 1998 and civil wars reactivated again by then. The two-decade failure reform leaves many African countries incapable of leading another economic reform.\n\nNorth Korea is a communist country with the central economic planning system. With the ongoing nuclear issue, North Korea is politically and economically isolated from other countries. Therefore, several tries for economic reforms did not appear to be successful.\n\nIts economy relied heavily on the defense industry and the consumer goods industry had been overlooked according to the \"juche\" policy. Under the Third Seven-Year Economic Plan (1987–93), DPRK aimed to focus on technology-based industry and to solve their scarcity of electricity. Nevertheless, it did not give a satisfiable result. One of the causes was its relationship with trading partners and losing supportive allies. In response, North Korea tried to attract foreign investors by endorsing joint venture and opening some free-trade zones. Unluckily, with other factors, this policy was not practical. In addition, it also had to encounter a massive military expenditure to secure its leader with both internal and external threat.\n\nLater in 2002, there was another attempt to make a market liberalization reform, which the government tries to let the demand and supply determine the price level, which used to be controlled by the central government. It also gave some authority to local producers to make some economic decisions by themselves. Other than the decentralization policy, North Korea also kept trying to induce foreign investors in several ways, including depreciation of its currency and the initiation of Sinuiju Special Administrative District.\n\nStill, its solution to successfully reform its economy appears to be contradicting with its leader security regimes. Kim Jong-il's goal, “kangsong taeguk” or “rich nation/strong army,” appears to be unachievable. It caused him facing a reform dilemma. Opening up the country likely to facilitate the reform to be successful, while it would also make its dictatorship insecure. \n\n"}

Its name indicated its relationship with Riverina and the seat of Darling, abolished in 1969.\n\nRiverina-Darling had a notional Labor majority on its creation. However, it included most of the old Riverina, and was thus a natural choice for that seat's member, Noel Hicks of the National Party, to transfer for the 1984 election.

Located along Route 138 some east of Sept-Îles, it is the largest town and seat of the Minganie RCM, and home to many government, municipal, and regional services.\n\nHistorically, the town's first inhabitants came from the Magdalen Islands in the nineteenth century. As a result, the people of the town speak a dialect much more closely related to Acadian French than to Quebec French.\n\nOther important geological features near the town include the Romaine River to the north and west, les Chutes Manitou, on the Manitou River to the west, l'Ile du Havre, less than a kilometre offshore from the town, and Anticosti Island, which on clear days can be seen to the south of the town.\n\nIn 1857, a group of Acadian families from the Magdalen Islands, who had been deported from Savannah (Georgia, USA), settled on Eskimo Point (\"Pointe aux Esquimaux\"). The first mass was held on June 29, 1857, day of the feast of Saint Peter. In 1872, the Parish of Saint-Pierre-de-la-Pointe-aux-Esquimaux was officially established, the same year its post office opened under the name Esquimaux Point.\n\nIn 1873, the place was incorporated as a municipality. In 1924, the post office changed its name to Havre-Saint-Pierre, followed by the town in 1927, in order to focus on the harbor, which characterizes the area, while retaining the original parish name. It remained the largest town on the North Shore until 1936 when it was overtaken by Baie-Comeau.\n\nThe city hospital is the major employer in the region. Havre-Saint-Pierre is also located near Canada's only titanium mine, for which the town serves as a port. Since 1948, the Quebec Iron and Titanium Company mines deposits of ilmenite, a mineral composed of iron and titanium, at a site some north. The Chemin de fer de la Rivière Romaine brings it by rail cars to Havre-Saint-Pierre.\n\nTourism contributes significantly to the local economy due to the town's position near the Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve, a park encompassing a large number of islands in Mingan Archipelago of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. It is noted for the unique variety of flora and fauna to be found there, such as puffins and the rare Mingan Thistle, and for the unique geological features on many of the islands, which are referred to as \"monoliths\".\n\nThe town is also noted for the excellent fishing, being made up largely of snow crab, scallops, and lobster, with excellent salmon and trout to be found in the numerous rivers and lakes.\n\nIn spite of its maritime position just above the 50th parallel, Havre-Saint-Pierre has a relatively harsh subarctic climate, with cold winters and cool summers, although the fourth-warmest month of September is relatively close to the isotherm to be cold humid continental. The high precipitation brings a lot of snowfall in winter.\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n"}

His works have been performed in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia, South America, and the Near East.\n\nFrom 1966-9 he formed a band with Z'EV and James Stewart, performing jazz rock. After auditioning for Frank Zappa's Bizarre Records, the band ceased activities and both he and Z'EV went on to attend CalArts.\n\nStone studied composition at the California Institute of the Arts with Morton Subotnick and James Tenney and has composed electro-acoustic music almost exclusively since 1972. As an undergrad at CalArts, he had a work-study job in the Music Library, which had many thousands of LP records in the circulating collection (this was 1973). The collection included a lot of western classical music of course but also a really comprehensive world music collection, avant-garde, electronic music, jazz and more. Because the librarians were concerned that the LPs, many of which were rare, would soon become unlistenable at the hands of the students and faculty, his job was to take every disc and record it onto cassette, a kind of back-up operation. He soon discovered that he could monitor the output of any of the recordings he was making and even mix them together without disturbing the recordings. So, he began to experiment, making musical collages, and started to develop habits of combining disparate musical materials. In addition to his composition and performance schedule, he is a faculty member in the Department of Information Media, School of Information Science and Technology at Chukyo University in Japan.\n\nStone utilizes a laptop computer as his primary instrument and his works often feature very slowly developing manipulations of samples of acoustic music, speech, or other sounds. Because of this, as well as his preference for tonal melodic and harmonic materials similar to those used in popular musics, Stone's work has been associated with the movement known as minimalism.\n\nPrior to his settling on the laptop, in the 1980s, he created a number of electronic and collage works utilizing various electronic equipment as well as turntables. Prominent works from this period include \"Dong Il Jang\" (1982) and \"Shibucho\" (1984), both of which subjected a wide variety of appropriated musical materials (e.g. Okinawan folk song, European Renaissance music, 1960s Motown, etc.) to fragmentation and looping. In this way his work paralleled innovations being made in the early days of rap and hip hop (e.g. Grandmaster Flash, of whose work he was unaware at the time). It was during this period that he began naming many of his works after his favorite restaurants (often Asian ones).\n\nHis first residency in Japan, sponsored by the Asian Cultural Council, was from November 1988 to April 1989. While living in Tokyo he collected more than 50 hours of recordings of the city's urban soundscape, which he later used as the basis for his radio composition \"Kamiya Bar\", sponsored by Tokyo FM radio, and released on a CD of the same name by the Italian label NewTone / Robi Droli.\n\nStone has collaborated frequently with Asian performers, including traditional instrumentalists such as Min Xiao-Fen (pipa), Yumiko Tanaka (shamisen), Kazue Sawai (koto), Michiko Akao (ryuteki), and those working with modern instruments, such as Otomo Yoshihide (turntables, guitar), Kazuhisa Uchihashi (guitar, daxophone), Yuji Takahashi (computer, piano), and vocalists such as Reisu Saki and Haco. He has also collaborated on an album with Hirohito Ihara's Radicalfashion and recently with Alfred Harth who partly lives in Korea.\n\nBeginning in the early years of the 21st century, Stone began to compose more frequently for acoustic instruments and ensembles, completing a new work for the San Francisco Bay Area-based American Baroque.\n\nStone served as president of the American Music Center from 1992 to 1995, and was director of Meet the Composer/California from 1981 to 1997. He also served as music director of KPFK-FM in Los Angeles from 1978 to 1981.\n\nFor many years, Stone has divided his time between San Francisco and Japan.\n\nStone received a 1999 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award.\n\nAl Noor (2007) – Explorations into the dismantling and re-composition of global song and melody\n<br>\nNak Won (2002) – Real-time music for laptop computer\n<br>\nResonator (2002) – Soundtrack for the works of sculptor Seiji Kunishima\n<br>\nExusiai (1998, released 1999) – Music for contemporary dancer Akira Kasai\n<br>\nem:t 1196 (1996) – The musical part of a three-way collaboration between the composer, dancer Kuniko Kisanuki and sculptor Satoru Shoji\n<br>\nKamiya Bar (1995) – Excerpts from a sound collage assembled in 1992 from TV commercials and field recordings made in Tokyo in the late 1980s\n<br>\nMom’s (1992) \n<br>\nFour Pieces (1989) – Playful explorations and transformations for Macintosh computer \n<br>\n\"Wave-Heat\" (1983) – Piece for digital delay/harmonizer and an LP record; released on audio cassette\n\nWoo Lae Oak (1981, released 1983; re-issued 2008 as a single continuous track) – A concrete symphony for the tremolo of a rubbed string and the tone of a blown bottle\n\n\nPict.soul (2000–2001) – Long-distance collaboration with Tetsu Inoue\n<br>\nMonogatari: Amino Argot (1994) – Long-distance collaboration with Otomo Yoshihide\n<br>\nOver-Ring-Under (1992) – Soundtrack to a videogame CD-ROM, with visual artist Teckon\n\n\n\n"}

Lindalino successfully revolted against the flying island of Laputa. The name Lindalino is a play on words of Dublin.\n\nLaputa had several methods of enforcing obedience from its subject towns. The island could be made to hover over a city indefinitely, depriving them of sunlight and rain. In more extreme situations, this would be combined with dropping large rocks on the inhabitants. Finally, the Laputans had the ability to lower their island directly onto a town, utterly destroying it. This was exceedingly rare, due to the risk it would pose to the integrity of Laputa itself.\n\nAs a result of oppressions and tribute demanded from them by Laputa, the Lindalinians rebelled against their governor and constructed tall towers at each of the four corners of the city. On top of these, they placed powerful lodestones, or magnets. The result of this was that when Laputa approached them, it was pulled toward these towers more swiftly than the king had expected. As a test, the Laputans then dropped several pieces of adamant, the substance from which their island was constructed. These were violently drawn to the towers. Realizing the situation, the king of Laputa had no choice but to give in to Lindalino's conditions. If he had not, the island would have been fixed in place and overthrown.\n\nThe story of Lindalino is an allegory for Great Britain's impositions on Ireland. Swift had earlier written a series of pamphlets, known as \"Drapier's Letters\", to rouse public opinion on the matter. Lindalino represents Dublin, and the impositions of Laputa represent the British imposition of William Wood's currency.\n\nEarly publications of \"Gulliver's Travels\", including those by Benjamin Motte and George Faulkner, did not include the passage relating to Lindalino, for fear of political reprisal. It was not until 1899 that the passage was finally included in a new edition of the Collected Works. Modern editions derive from the Faulkner edition with the inclusion of this 1899 addendum.\n\n"}

The gang's leader, George, seems to take particular delight in \"bumping off\" women who cross him. The film starts with comments from then-governors of North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland about how crime doesn't pay.\n\n\nAccording to Warner Bros records the film earned $759,000 domestically and $845,000 foreign.\nWhen the film was first released, \"The New York Times\" critic Bosley Crowther caustically panned it, writing, \"The most disturbing and depressing of the many depressing things about the Strand's current Warner Brothers' shocker, \"Highway 301\", is the fact that governors in Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina endorse this cheap gangster melodrama as an effective deterrent to crime. In forewords which are personally delivered by Maryland's lame-duck Governor Lane and by Virginia's and North Carolina's Governors Battle and Scott, respectively, these eminent and honorable officials convey the solemn idea that what you are about to see is something that will prove to you how profitless crime is ...

It is a major teaching hospital for tertiary health care with a reputation in clinical research. The hospital is managed as part of Melbourne Health which comprises the Royal Melbourne Hospital, North West Dialysis Service and North Western Mental Health. The Melbourne Health Chief Executive is Christine Kilpatrick AO.\n\nThe emergency department is at the City Campus, 300 Grattan Street, Parkville.\n\nEstablished in 1848 as the Melbourne Hospital, it was one of Melbourne's leading hospitals. Originally located on the corner of Swanston and Lonsdale Streets, Melbourne in 1935 the hospital was renamed the Royal Melbourne Hospital and, in 1944, it moved to Grattan Street, Parkville by provision of lands in the Royal Melbourne Hospital Act. The old buildings then became home to the Queen Victoria Hospital. \n\nThe Royal Women's Hospital was previously located in Carlton, Melbourne. The hospital moved in late 2008 to a new building, the new Royal Women's Hospital, co-located on the Royal Melbourne Hospital site in Parkville.\n\nDuring World War II, the Parkville hospital, which was under construction, was occupied by the US Army 4th General Hospital between 1942 and 1944. While the hospital was under construction a temporary tent hospital was set up by the US Army in Royal Park just north of the hospital. Upon completion of the Parkville hospital the patients were moved progressively into the new accommodation which catered for 2,900 beds.\n\nThe Royal Melbourne Hospital continued to operate from their old premises on the corner of Lonsdale and Swanston Streets until the 4th General Hospital moved to Finschhaven in New Guinea in 1944. The Parkville buildings were reconditioned and the Royal Melbourne Hospital finally moved into their \"new\" premises in December 1944.\n\nThe Royal Melbourne Hospital provides acute tertiary referral services at its main site on Grattan Street between Flemington Road and Royal Parade and ancillary services such as aged care, rehabilitation, ambulatory care and residential and community services through its Royal Park site.\n\nIt has one of the largest Emergency Departments in Victoria and is, with the Alfred Hospital, one of Victoria's two major trauma referral centres. The emergency facilities include: 2 trauma bays, 7 resuscitation cubicles, 25 general cubical beds and 17 short-stay beds. There is also a helipad on top of the hospital so that urgent cases that need to be airlifted from regional areas can be transferred to the Royal Melbourne.\n\nMost medical and surgical specialties are available at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. It is one of very few public hospitals in the Australasia that routinely performs robotic surgery. In addition, the Victoria Infectious Diseases Service (VIDS) is based in the hospital, as is the John Cade Psychiatry Ward and the headquarters of the North Western Mental Health service.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Royal Melbourne Hospital has an Enhanced Crisis Assessment & Treatment Team & Triage Service (ECATT) team on call 24 hours a day to assess patients in the Emergency Department.\n\nThe clinical school at Royal Melbourne Hospital is one of the clinical schools of the University of Melbourne School of Medicine (the others being based at the St Vincent's Hospital, the Austin Hospital, Shepparton Regional Hospital, Northern Hospital, Western Hospital, Ballarat Hospital, Bendigo Hospital, and Northeast Health Wangaratta).\n\nIn postgraduate training, Royal Melbourne Hospital also produced the top candidate in the Royal Australasian Physician College fellowship exam in the year 2002, 2003 and 2013. In March 2006, it achieved a 100% passing rate for the Fellowship written exam. It is regularly one of Australia's top performing hospitals in these exams. It also produces excellent surgical candidates.\n\nThe hospital offers enormous numbers of postgraduate educational activities, including weekly professorial case discussion meeting, grand round, daily morning registrars teaching round, intern training sessions, advanced life support forums, and many other individual department-based educational sessions.\n\nThe new residents' quarter is located on the 8th floor, equipped with Foxtel pay TV, wireless network, new computers, 10 bedrooms and stunning panoramic view of the city of Melbourne.\n\nThe Royal Melbourne Nursing Education Department provides continuing professional education opportunities for nurses that enhance practice and meet clinical service needs. It offers innovative programs for undergraduates, graduate nurses and postgraduate students as well as short courses, staff development and mandatory resuscitation training. It also offers some online training modules.\n\nThe innovative programs focus on recruitment and retention of nurses. The Royal Melbourne Hospital promotes an environment that encourages staff development and workforce retention through the implementation of initiatives, which focus on workplace learning and clinical facilitation. Nursing Education recognises the importance of meeting the learning needs of nurses caring for clinically challenging patients. Excellence in patient care is also maintained by the provision of continued support for new, junior and permanent nursing staff.\n\nIn addition to post graduate training, largely aimed at Australian trainees, the Royal Melbourne Hospital also offers numerous clinical and research fellowship positions, most of which are open to both Australian and international candidates.\n\nFellowships available include:\n\nThe Hospital is recognised internationally for its clinical research in oncology, neurosciences, infectious diseases, diabetes colorectal cancer and mental health.\n\nIn addition, there are close ties with:\n\nPatients and visitors have access to a car park inside the hospital (accessed from Royal Parade), street parking in the streets around the hospital (4-hour ticket, 2 hours free and various 15-minute spots) and a patient transport bay which is accessed from Grattan Street. The patient transport bay (for pick-ups and drop-offs) is located approximately halfway up the hospital block, next to the red Emergency ambulance entrance. Drivers are requested to be mindful of not leaving private vehicles unattended and to observe low and high ambulance parking requirements. A patient transport ambulance has right of way in this area.\n\nThe number 58 and 59 trams stop on the corner of Flemington Road and Grattan Street, or the number 19 tram stops on the corner of Grattan Street and Royal Parade.

M. Dagar, was a North Indian (Hindustani) classical musician, one of the 19th generation of Dagar family dhrupad musicians. He was largely responsible for the revival of the rudra vina as a solo concert instrument.\n\nZ. M. Dagar was born in the town of Udaipur, Rajasthan and began musical study with his father, Ustad Ziauddin Khan Dagar, court musician for the Maharana of Udaipur. He was trained both in vocals and in the rudra veena, an instrument used by vocalists to practice melodies. The veena was traditionally not played in public, but the young Zia Mohiuddin adopted it as his primary instrument, giving his first recital at age 16. Although he was discouraged by his father from experimenting with the structure of the veena, he nevertheless modified the instrument after his father's death to better equip it for solo performance, transforming it into a larger bass instrument (sometimes called a 'Dagar veena'): With the help of the instrument house Kanailal & Brother, he enlarged the tumbas (gourds) and dhandhi (hollow neck) to create greater resonance and to allow the notes to sustain longer and so better reproduce the techniques used in dhrupad singing. Because of these modifications, the instrument was too heavy to be held in the standard Northern posture (with one tumba on the left shoulder), so he played instead in the Southern posture, with one tumba on the ground and one on the left knee.\n\nAfter India gained independence the princely states were abolished. The Dagar family lost the patronage of the court of Udaipur, and had to seek employment elsewhere. Finally they arrived in Mumbai. For 25 years they had to make ends meet by working in garages, selling bread, and rarely, playing instruments for movie scores. They did not have a tanpura, sitar, or veena, let alone a house. There was much cynicism about dhrupad, as his son Mohi Baha'ud-din recounted in an interview.\n\n\"Dhrupad? Who'll listen? Rudra veena? Play something else. Long alaaps? So boring!\" \n\nZ. M. Dagar was known particularly for his slow development of ragas, typically performed only with tanpura accompaniment (he rarely played with pakhawaj), and for his meticulous attention to microtonal inflections.\n\nHe was very active in the West, associating himself with the American Society for Eastern Arts in Berkeley, California and with Wesleyan University, Rotterdam Music Conservatory, and the University of Washington, Seattle, where he was a visiting professor.\n\nIn 1990, Ustadji was awarded the Kalidas Samman, one of India's most prestigious awards, by the Madhya Pradesh government. He also received the Sangeet Natak Academi Award, the Rajasthan Sangeet Natak Academi award, and the Maharana Kumbha award, to name a few.\n\nHis younger brother, Ustad Zia Fariddudin Dagar, was a vocalist and teacher, and his son, Mohi Baha'ud-din, is a veena player.\n\nEstablished in 1982\nThe concept of making a Gurukul was entirely Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar's.

It offers a full range of services in maternity, gynaecology, neonatal care, women's cancers and women's health. It also offers complementary services such as social work, physiotherapy, dietetics and pastoral care. Specialist clinics in endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain, menopause symptoms after cancer, infertility are also available. It is a major teaching hospital of over 200 beds with links to the University of Melbourne and La Trobe University. Co-located in the same building is the Frances Perry Private Hospital, a 69 bed private hospital for women.\n\nThe hospital was established at Eastern Hill by doctors Richard Tracy and John Maund on 19 August 1856 as a place where under-privileged women could give birth with proper medical attention. The doctors were assisted by a group of women led by Mrs Frances Perry, the wife of the Bishop of Melbourne. The original title for the hospital was the \"Melbourne Lying-in Hospital and Infirmary for Diseases Peculiar to Women and Children\".\n\nThe Women’s was the first specialist teaching hospital in the Antipodes, and the first hospital in Australia to train nurses and midwives and the first in Australia to hold postgraduate classes for nurses.\n\nIn 1858 it was relocated to a site in Carlton, which spanned the block between Swanston and Cardigan Streets and Grattan and Faraday Streets. In March 1884, the hospital was renamed \"The Hospital for Women\", with the royal title being conferred on 6 September 1954.\n\nIn 2005, then Victorian Premier Steve Bracks and Health Minister Bronwyn Pike announced a major redevelopment and relocation of the Royal Women's Hospital and Frances Perry Private Hospital next to the Royal Melbourne Hospital on the corner of Grattan Street and Flemington Road in Parkville. The new building and facilities, built by Baulderstone, were opened on 13 June 2008. The new building cost the Victorian Government $250 million, and has the capacity for more than 7,000 births per year.\n"}

The unfinished, ruined mansion, was built by a Scottish planter named William Kellie-Smith. According to differing accounts, it was either a gift for his wife or a home for his son. Kellie's Castle is situated beside the Raya River (Sungai Raya), which is a small creek to the Kinta River.\n\nWilliam Kellie-Smith (1870—1926) was born in 1870 in Kellas, Moray Firth, Scotland. In 1890, at the age of 20, he arrived in Malaya as a civil engineer. He joined Charles Alma Baker's survey firm, who had won concessions from the state government to clear 9,000 hectares of forests in Batu Gajah, Perak. With the substantial profits made from his business venture with Baker, Kellie-Smith bought 1,000 acres (405 ha) of jungle land in the district of Kinta and started planting rubber trees and dabbled in the tin mining industry.\n\nIn time, he named his estate \"Kinta Kellas\" after his home farm \"Easter Kellas\". Kellie-Smith went on to own the Kinta Kellas Tin Dredging Company as well. With his fortune made, he returned home to marry his Scottish sweetheart, Agnes, and brought her over to Malaya in 1903. They had a daughter named Helen the following year.\n\nIn 1909 Kellie-Smith built his first mansion, \"Kellas House\", which was so unique that it was even mentioned in the London \"Financier\" newspaper on 15 September 1911. (Kellie-Smith's mansion is accessible from the main road across a bridge over a stream.)\n\nIn 1915, with the birth of his son and heir Anthony, Kellie-Smith started planning for a huge castle with Scottish, Moorish, and Tamilvanan Indian architecture. \n\nKellie-Smith brought in 70 craftsmen Tamilvanan from Madras, India. All the bricks and marble were imported from India, too. Included in the plan for the 6-storey tower was Malaysia's first elevator, an indoor tennis court and a rooftop courtyard for entertaining.\n\nDuring construction, a virulent strain of Spanish flu struck his workmen. When his workmen approached him to build a temple nearby, Kellie-Smith readily agreed. In return for his generosity, they built a statue of him beside the other deities on the lord murugan temple wall. It is believed that a tunnel was built to the temple from the castle. (Descendants of the Tamil labourers brought over to Malaya to work on the mansion still live nearby even now.)\n\nWilliam Kellie-Smith died at the age of 56 of pneumonia during a short trip to Lisbon, Portugal in 1926. William's wife was devastated and decided to move back to Scotland; construction on the castle was never completed by Tamilvanan workers. In the end, Kellas House, later known as \"Kellie's Folly\" or \"Kellie's Castle,\" was sold to a British company called Harrisons and Crosfield.\n\nKellie's Castle is now a popular local tourist attraction, with some believing it to be haunted. \n\nIt was used as a setting in the 1999 film \"Anna and the King\" and 2000 film \"Skyline Cruisers\".\n\nIn 2015, Kellie's Castle was the site of the first ever 24-hour comic challenge in a castle. A collaboration between Port Ipoh and the Malaysian Comic Activist Society (PEKOMIK) and Malaysian Animation Society (ANIMAS), the event took place on 21–22 March 2015 and was claimed as the \"scariest\" 24 hour comics challenge.\n\n\n"}

A benign tumor originating from the same tissue is termed leiomyoma. While it has been believed that leiomyosarcomas do not arise from leiomyomas, there are leiomyoma variants for which classification is evolving. \n\nAbout 1 in 100,000 people get diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma (LMS) each year. LMS is one of the more common types of soft-tissue sarcoma, representing 10 percent to 20 percent of new cases. (Leiomyosarcoma of the bone is more rare.) Sarcoma is rare, consisting of only 1 percent of cancer cases in adults. Leiomyosarcomas can be very unpredictable. They can remain dormant for long periods of time and recur after years. It is a resistant cancer, meaning generally not very responsive to chemotherapy or radiation. The best outcomes occur when it can be removed surgically with wide margins early, while small and still in situ.\n\nSmooth muscle cells make up the involuntary muscles, which are found in most parts of the body, including the uterus, stomach and intestines, the walls of all blood vessels, and the skin. It is therefore possible for leiomyosarcomas to appear at any site in the body. They are most commonly found in the uterus, stomach, small intestine and retroperitoneum.\n\nUterine leiomyosarcomas come from the smooth muscle in the muscle layer of the uterus. Cutaneous leiomyosarcomas derive from the pilo-erector muscles in the skin. Gastrointestinal leiomyosarcomas might come from smooth muscle in the GI tract or, alternatively, also from a blood vessel. At most other primary sites—retroperitoneal extremity (in the abdomen, behind the intestines), truncal, abdominal organs, etc.—leiomyosarcomas appear to grow from the muscle layer of a blood vessel (the tunica media). Thus, a leiomyosarcoma can have a primary site of origin anywhere in the body where there is a blood vessel.\n\nThe tumors are usually hemorrhagic and soft and microscopically marked by pleomorphism, abundant (15–30 per 10 high power fields) abnormal mitotic figures, and coagulative tumor cell necrosis. There is a wide differential diagnosis, which includes spindle cell carcinoma, spindle cell melanoma, fibrosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and even biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma.\n\nDiagnosis of LMS is made by performing a soft tissue biopsy and examining its histopathology. \n\nSurgery, with as wide a margin of removal as possible, has generally been the most effective and preferred way to attack LMS. If surgical margins are narrow or not clear of tumor, however, or in some situations where tumor cells were left behind, chemotherapy or radiation has been shown to give a clear survival benefit. While LMS tends to be resistant to radiation and chemotherapy, each case is different and results can vary widely. \n\nFor metastatic (widespread) disease, chemotherapy and targeted therapies are the first choices. \nChemotherapy regimens are: doxorubicin/ ifosfamide and doxorubicin combination/gemcitabine and docetaxel/ trabectedin\npazopanib is the targeted therapy used in metastatic leiomyosarcoma as second line and is well tolerated. \n\nLMS of uterine origin often respond to hormonal treatments. As of 2020, there are several active clinical trials for uterine LMS.\n\nPeople who have had leiomyosarcoma include:\n\n"}

He attended the University of Wyoming. After a stint working as a cowpuncher, Cochran developed his acting skills in local theatre and gradually progressed to Broadway, film and television.\n\nCochran was born in Eureka, California, but grew up in Laramie, Wyoming, the son of a logger. While he appeared in high school plays, he spent more time delving into athletics, particularly basketball.\n\nAfter stints as a cowpuncher and railroad station hand, he studied at the University of Wyoming, where he also played basketball. Impulsively, he quit college in 1937 and decided to go straight to Hollywood to become a star.\n\nWorking as a carpenter and department store detective during his early days, he gained experience appearing in summer stock and in the early 1940s he was given the chance to work with the Shakespeare Festival in Carmel. There he played \"Orsino\" in \"Twelfth Night\", \"Malcolm\" in \"Macbeth\", \"Horatio\" in \"Hamlet\" and the ungainly title role of \"Richard III\". \n\nCochran performed in plays in the Federal Theatre Project in Detroit. During World War II he was rejected for military service due to a heart murmur but directed and performed in plays at a variety of Army camps.,\n\nIn December 1943 he was appearing with Constance Bennett in a touring production of \"Without Love\" when he was signed by Sam Goldwyn.\n\nOn Broadway, Cochran appeared in \"Hickory Stick\" (1944).\n\nSamuel Goldwyn brought Cochran to Hollywood in 1945. Goldwyn only made a few films a year so he loaned Cochran to Columbia Pictures for \"Booked on Suspicion\" (1945), a Boston Blackie movie.\n\nGoldwyn then put him in \"Wonder Man\" (1945) a Danny Kaye movie co-starring Virginia Mayo and Vera-Ellen; Cochran played a gangster. Columbia used him in another Boston Blackie, \"Blackie's Rendezvous\" (1945), where he played a villain, and in \"The Gay Senorita\" (1945), with Jinx Falkenburg.\n\nGoldwyn used Cochran in another Danny Kaye movie with Mayo and Vera-Ellen, \"The Kid from Brooklyn\" (1946). After United Artists borrowed him to play a gangster in \"The Chase\" (1946), Cochran appeared in his prestigious drama, \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (1946), playing a man who has an affair with Virginia Mayo while her husband Dana Andrews was away at war. The movie was a huge critical and commercial success.\n\nCochran had a supporting role opposite Groucho Marx in \"Copacabana\" (1947) for United Artists. Goldwyn got him to play another gangster opposite Kaye and Mayo in \"A Song is Born\" (1948), directed by Howard Hawks. He made his TV debut in \"Dinner at Antoine's\" for \"The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse\" (1949) and followed this with \"Tin Can Skipper\" for \"NBC Presents\" (1949). He returned to Broadway for a short lived revival of Mae West's \"Diamond Lil\", supporting West. This revived Hollywood's interest in him.\n\nIn 1949 Cochran went over to Warner Bros., where he played Big Ed Somers, a power hungry henchman to James Cagney’s psychotic mobster in \"White Heat\" (1949). He appeared opposite Mayo. Warner Bros. eventually took over Cochran's and Mayo's contracts from Goldwyn.\n\nCochran supported Joan Crawford in \"The Damned Don't Cry\" (1950), then was given his first lead role in \"Highway 301\" (1950), playing a gangster. He was a villain to Gary Cooper's hero in \"Dallas\" (1950), and played a Ku Klux Klan member in \"Storm Warning\" (1951), with Ginger Rogers and Doris Day.\n\nCochran was a villain in \"Canyon Pass\" (1951), a Western, then was given the lead in \"Inside the Walls of Folsom Prison\" (1951), which inspired Johnny Cash to write his song \"Folsom Prison Blues\".\n\nWarners gave him another lead in \"Tomorrow Is Another Day\" (1951), a film noir with Ruth Roman. He was back to support parts in \"Jim Thorpe – All-American\" (1951) with Burt Lancaster.\n\nWarners starred him in \"The Tanks Are Coming\" (1951) and \"The Lion and the Horse\" (1952). He co-starred with Cornel Wilde in \"Operation Secret\" (1952) and supported Virginia Mayo in \"She's Back on Broadway\" (1953). In \"The Desert Song\" (1953), Cochran played Gordon Macrae's rival for Kathryn Grayson. He then left Warners.\n\nCochran starred in the low budget action film \"Shark River\" (1953) for United Artists. At Universal he was a villain to Rock Hudson in \"Back to God's Country\" (1953).\n\nHe returned to television appearing in episodes of \"Lux Video Theatre\" (\"Three Just Men\" (1953)), and \"Studio One in Hollywood\" (\"Letter of Love\" (1953)). Cochran went to Germany to make \"Carnival Story\" (1954) for the King Brothers.\n\nBack in Hollywood he made \"Private Hell 36\" (1954) with Ida Lupino for director Don Siegel. He did \"Foreign Affair\" (1954) for \"Robert Montgomery Presents\" and \"The Role of a Lover\" (1954) and \"The Most Contagious Game\" (1955) for \"Studio One\", \"Trip Around the Block\" (1954) and \"The Menace of Hasty Heights\" (1956) for \"The Ford Television Theatre\", \"The After House\" (1954), \"Fear is the Hunter\" (1956), \"Bait for the Tiger\" (1957) for \"Climax!\", and \"The Seeds of Hate\" (1955) for \"General Electric Theatre\".\n\nRepublic Pictures hired him to play Ann Sheridan's love interest in \"Come Next Spring\" (1956).

His production company attempted to make some television series and other films such as \"The Tom Mix Story\" (with Cochran as Mix), \"Hope is the Last Thing to Die\" about the Mexican War, and \"Klondike Lou\". However they were never produced with the exception of a television pilot where he played John C. Frémont in \"Fremont the Trailblazer\".\n\nHowever Cochran did write, produce, direct and star in \"Tell Me in the Sunlight\" (1965).\n\nCochran was a notorious womanizer and attracted tabloid attention for his tumultuous private life, which included well-documented affairs with numerous starlets and actresses. Mamie Van Doren later wrote about their sex life in graphic detail in her tell-all autobiography \"Playing the Field: My Story\" (New York: G.P. Putnam, 1987). He was also married and divorced three times, to actress Fay McKenzie, Florence Lockwood and Jonna Jensen. He and Lockwood had one daughter, Xandra, through whom he is the grandfather of film and television producer Alex Johns, who co-executive produced more than seventy episodes of the animated television series \"Futurama\". In the 2002 documentary \"The Importance of Being Morrissey\", Steven Morrissey claims that his parents named him after Steve Cochran.\n\nCochran was in trouble with the police a number of times in his life, including a reported assault and a charge of reckless driving in 1953.\n\nCochran has a star at 1750 Hollywood Boulevard in the Motion Pictures section of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was dedicated February 8, 1960.\n\nOn June 15, 1965, at the age of 48, Cochran died on his yacht off the coast of Guatemala, reportedly due to an acute lung infection. His body, along with three Mexican girls and women aged 14, 19 and 25, remained aboard for 10 days since the girls did not know how to operate the boat. It drifted to shore in Port Champerico, Guatemala, and was found by authorities.\n\nThere were various rumors of foul play and poisoning, but reportedly no new evidence was found.\n\n"}

The supporting cast features Margaret Lindsay and Jane Wyman.\n\nSlim, a farmer from southeastern Ohio, becomes fascinated by a crew of linemen erecting transmission towers across his uncle and aunt's property. He asks Pop (J. Farrell MacDonald) for a job, but there are no openings. When a man is fired, however, Red (Pat O'Brien), Pop's best lineman, takes a liking to Slim and persuades Pop to give him a chance as a \"grunt\", an assistant on the ground who sends up tools and parts. Red and Stumpy (Stuart Erwin), another grunt, teach Slim what he needs to know.\n\nSlim wins the respect of Red and Pop when he spots cheating during a poker game and pitches in during the ensuing brawl. When hungover lineman Wyatt Ranstead falls and is killed, Slim is promoted to lineman. The company sends a vice president to investigate the death. To save Pop's job, Red deliberately antagonizes the executive and is fired. Slim gets himself dismissed out of loyalty, and the two go on the road.\n\nThey head to Chicago to see Red's girlfriend, Cally (Margaret Lindsay) a nurse.

When Red is later offered the job of foreman at another camp, he initially turns it down, but changes his mind when Slim offers to be his \"straw boss\" (assistant). Wilcox, who had been hoping for the promotion himself, tries to sabotage Red's rope, but Slim stops him. Later, on the ground, Wilcox pulls out a knife and stabs Slim. While Slim is recovering in the hospital, Cally comes to nurse him. They admit they love each other and tell Red they are going to get married. When Slim is offered stable, safe maintenance work, Cally accepts for him. Slim, however, refuses to give up his dangerous profession, and when Pop sends for Red, goes with him.\n\nThey arrive during a terrible blizzard, and are called out to a substation to restore power, even though there are \"hot\" wires all around. Red and another man fall to their deaths when a line breaks. Cally joins Slim and once again tries to talk him out of line work. When Slim heads back out into the snow to complete the job, Cally accepts his decision, telling him, \"I'll be waiting for you.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Some people have discrete attacks, which can last between 10 and 120 minutes while others are symptomatic almost constantly due to atmospheric humidity levels and/or sweating. Itching most frequently occurs on the legs, arms, chest, back, and abdomen, though it can also occur elsewhere. \n\nItching on contact with water that also includes hives is known as Aquagenic Urticaria.\n\nThe exact mechanism of the condition is unknown. Some studies have suggested the itching occurs in response to increased fibrinolytic activity in the skin, inappropriate activation of the sympathetic nervous system, or increased activity of Acetylcholinesterase.\n\nNo definitive medical test is known for aquagenic pruritus. Rather, diagnosis is made by excluding all other possible causes of the patient's itching, including polycythemia vera. Since pruritus is a symptom of many serious diseases, it is important to rule out other causes before making a final diagnosis.\n\nSince the cause of the condition cannot be fully avoided in all cases, treatment is usually focused on topical itch management. This can be effected by the application of antipruritic lotions or creams, using phototherapy, or the application of hot or cold packs to the skin after water contact. Paradoxically, hot baths or showers help many patients, possibly because heat causes mast cells in the skin to release their supply of histamine and to remain depleted for up to 24 hours afterward.\n\nH1 and H2 blockers, such as loratadine, doxepin, or cimetidine, have historically been the first line of pharmacological treatment, but not all sufferers find relief with these medications. When antihistamines do work, loratadine seems to be the most effective for mild cases and doxepin most effective for more severe cases.\n\nNaltrexone, hydrocortisone, or propranolol may relieve itching for some people.\n\nSertraline or other Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is also a line of treatment. \n\nThe name is derived from Latin: aquagenic, meaning water-induced, and pruritus, meaning itch.\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n"}

When the Hebrew slave-girl who waits on his wife tells her of a Jewish prophet in Samaria who can cure her master, he obtains a letter from King Ben-Hadad II of Aram to King Joram of Israel in which the former asks Joram to arrange for the healing of his subject Naaman. Naaman proceeds with the letter to King Joram. The king of Israel suspects in this – to him – impossible request a pretext of Syria for later starting a war against him, and tears his clothes.\n\nWhen the prophet Elisha hears about this, he sends for general Naaman. But rather than personally receiving Naaman when the latter arrives at Elisha's house, Elisha merely sends a messenger to the door who tells Naaman to cure his affliction by dipping himself seven times in the Jordan River. Naaman, a man of heathen faith who is unfamiliar with the Jewish \"mezora\", who had expected the prophet himself to come out to him and perform some kind of impressive ritual magic, angrily refuses, and prepares to go home unhealed. Only after Naaman's slaves suggest to their master that he has nothing to lose by at least giving it a try since the task is a simple and easy one, he takes his bath in the Jordan river as a \"mikveh\" as told and finds himself healed. The \"mikveh\" is a bath used for ritual immersion in Judaism.\n\nNaaman returns to Elisha with lavish gifts, which Elisha flatly refuses to accept. Naaman also renounces his former god Rimmon after being cured by Elisha and accepts the God of Israel. He does, however, ask that the God of Israel pardon him when he enters the temple of Rimmon as part of his obligations to the king of Syria.\n\nNaaman is also paraphrased in of the New Testament, in Greek as \"Ναιμὰν ὁ Σύρος\" or \"Naaman the Syrian\", a leper.\n\nChristian theology depicts Naaman as an example for the will of God to save people who are considered by men as less than pious and unworthy of salvation. \nThe Septuagint, the Greek Old Testament, uses the word \"baptizein\" for the dipping that heals the heathen Naaman from the skin disease called \"tzaraath\". The new baptism takes place in the Jordan River where Jesus of Nazareth, also called the Christ by his followers, was baptized many centuries later. Christians have often interpreted the Naaman story as prefiguring the Christian church rite of baptism.\n\n"}

It is based at the Abbot Hall Art Gallery in Kendal, England.\n\nIn 1984, Christina Hardyment had written an account of her own investigations into the real-life places and real-life people in Arthur Ransome's stories. As a direct result of this book, \"Arthur Ransome and Captain Flint's Trunk\", people interested in forming a society dedicated to Arthur Ransome had been leaving their contact details at Abbot Hall, where, following his death in 1967, his widow Evgenia had donated various articles, including his writing desk. In 1989, Christina followed up on these contact details by sending an appeal for funds to restore the dilapidated \"Mavis\", the supposed prototype for Arthur Ransome's \"Amazon.\" The response to this appeal was overwhelming and in June 1990 The Arthur Ransome Society was formed.\n\nA particularly large sum came from the Arthur Ransome Club (ARC) of Japan. The ceremony was attended by Christina Hardyment, Tamami Nakayama of ARC and Brigit Sanders (née Altounyan), a prototype of the character Bridget Walker. Brigit Sanders subsequently became President of TARS.\n\nIn 1997, the society was incorporated as a Company Limited by Guarantee.\n\nTARS produces several regular publications, holds many recreational and scholarly events and maintains a Ransome-themed website .

He writes the column \"On the Town with Rex Reed\" for \"The New York Observer\".\n\nReed was born on October 2, 1938, in Fort Worth, Texas, the son of Jewell (née Smith) and James M. Reed, an oil company supervisor. In an interview with \"The New York Times\", Reed stated: \"My mother came from a family of 10 in Oklahoma, her second cousins were the Dalton Gang,\" he said. \"And when my grandfather was a little boy, he was rocked by Jesse James on his knee.\"\n\nHe earned his journalism degree from Louisiana State University in 1960. There, he began writing film and play reviews, not only for the university's newspaper, The Daily Reveille, but also for the Baton Rouge newspaper, The Morning Advocate. He moved to New York City after graduating from LSU, hoping to find success as an actor. Instead, he was hired to work at the publicity department of 20th Century Fox. In 1969, he said his job there was to \"write those puffy things about Elvis Presley and—you know—Fabian, and tell everybody how great they were when I wouldn't be caught dead seeing their movies myself. [...] \"Cleopatra\" came along and rocked the company financially. We were saving on rubber bands and paying Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton to float down the Nile while everybody back at Fox was taking salary cuts, and I was the first one to go—the little guy at the $75 salary, the most dispensable item in the company. I was fired.\" Later in the decade, he provided many interviews for \"The New York Times\" and \"New York\", which at the time was the Sunday magazine of the \"New York Herald Tribune\". In 1966, the year in which the \"Herald Tribune\" folded, he was hired as one of the music critics for \"HiFi/Stereo Review\" (now \"Sound & Vision\"), a position at which he remained until early 1973.\n\nReed has acted occasionally, such as in the movie version of Gore Vidal's \"Myra Breckinridge\" (1970). Reed also appeared in the films \"Superman\" (1978, as himself), \"Inchon\" (1981) and \"Irreconcilable Differences\" (1984). He appeared frequently as a judge on the TV game show \"The Gong Show\" in the late 1970s. Reed additionally served on the jury at the 21st Berlin International Film Festival in 1971, and guest-voiced as himself on the animated series \"The Critic\".\n\nRex Reed appears in the 2009 documentary \"\" explaining how important film critics were in the 1970s, and complaining about the proliferation of unqualified critical voices on the Internet.\n\nBefore his current job as film critic for \"The New York Observer\", Reed has been a film critic for \"Vogue\", \"GQ\", \"The New York Times\", and \"Women's Wear Daily\". For thirteen years, he was an arts critic for the \"New York Daily News\", and for five years was the film critic for the \"New York Post\". He is a member of New York Film Critics Circle and, because his reviews appear on the Internet, he is a member of New York Film Critics Online. He is the author of eight books, four of which were best-selling profiles of celebrities: \"Do You Sleep in the Nude?\", \"Conversations in the Raw\", \"People Are Crazy Here\", and \"Valentines & Vitriol\". In the sixties and throughout the seventies, Reed was one of the highest-paid and most in-demand writers of celebrity profiles. His writing style was considered an exemplar of The New Journalism and his profile of the aging Ava Gardner was included and praised in Tom Wolfe's anthology, \"The New Journalism\".\n\nAfter Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 1992 for her work in \"My Cousin Vinny\", Reed said publicly that she had not actually won the award and that presenter Jack Palance had accidentally read the wrong name off of the card he was reading. When it was pointed out that the card only had one name on it, Reed changed his theory to say that Palance had actually read the wrong name off the Teleprompter and claimed that the Academy went along with it because they would have been embarrassed to admit that mistake in front of a huge viewing audience. Reed was publicly rebutted by the accounting firm Price Waterhouse, who said that if a presenter ever announced the wrong winner a PwC representative would go on stage and state that the wrong result had been announced and then either state the correct result himself or give the information to someone on stage to correct it. Roger Ebert said that Reed's conspiracy theories were false and unfair to Tomei and that Reed owed her an apology.\n\nIn a 2005 review of the South Korean movie \"Oldboy\", Reed wrote: \n\"The Village Voice\", which stated that \"online forums erupted in protest\" at the review, then mocked Reed by imagining him applying similar logic to films from other countries.\n\nIn a 2013 review of \"Identity Thief\", Reed made several references to Melissa McCarthy's weight, referring to her as \"tractor-sized\", \"humongous\", \"obese\", and a \"hippo\". Film critic Richard Roeper said, \"This just smacks of mean-spirited name-calling in lieu of genuine criticism.\" The review was referenced at the 85th Academy Awards on February 24, 2013, by the host, Seth MacFarlane, who joked that Reed would review Adele for singing \"Skyfall\" at the ceremony. In a column for \"The Huffington Post\", Candy Spelling likened Reed's review to bullying. Reed stood by his comments and stated his objection to the use of serious health issue such as obesity as comedy talking points. He dismissed the outrage as being orchestrated for publicity, but praised McCarthy for not getting involved in the matter, calling her \"completely classy\".\n\nIn 2016, Reed published a review of \"The Whole Truth\" in which he obsesses over star Renee Zellweger’s face. He wrote\nIn a 2017 review of \"The Shape of Water\", he referred to people with disabilities as \"defective creatures\" and Sally Hawkins' mute character as \"mentally handicapped\".\n\nReed's 2012 review for \"The Cabin in the Woods\" contained significant factual inaccuracies in his summary of the film, and exhibited a dismissive attitude towards anyone who disagreed with his negative opinion. \"The L Magazine\"'s Henry Stewart noted: \"his review is literally about 50 percent inaccurate—factually, objectively wrong.\" His professionalism was also called into question when, in addition to the factual inaccuracies, many felt he was needlessly insulting and mean-spirited towards those who enjoyed the film.\n\nIn 2013, Reed reviewed \"V/H/S/2\", despite walking out of the film within its first 20 minutes. As a result, his review was brief and incorrectly summarized Jason Eisener's segment of the horror anthology. Many felt that Reed was unprofessional, with journalist Sam Adams stating that Reed was \"making a mockery of a noble profession while intelligent critics scramble for crumbs all around him\".\n\nIn 2017, Reed's review of \"The Shape of Water\" mistook the film's writer and director Guillermo del Toro for actor Benicio del Toro (the two are not related; he also misspelled Benicio as Benecio). Reed's review was criticized and ridiculed for referring to Hawkins' mute character as \"mentally handicapped\" and for erroneously crediting Benicio del Toro as the film's director. Reed also described Guillermo del Toro's native country as Spain, despite him coming from Mexico, and Benicio del Toro himself coming from Puerto Rico.\n\nReed lives in a two-bedroom apartment at The Dakota apartment building in New York City, which he bought for $30,000 in 1969.\n\nIn 2018, Reed stated: \nIn February 2000, Reed was arrested for shoplifting after leaving a Tower Records in Manhattan with compact discs by Mel Tormé, Peggy Lee, and Carmen McRae in his jacket pockets. Reed, who had just purchased two other CDs, says he forgot about the other three CDs and his offer to pay for them was refused. The charges were later dropped. According to Reed, several days after the arrest Peggy Lee sent him her entire catalog of CDs, because \"she was so thrilled I wanted one of her CDs enough to put myself through so much hell\".\n\n\n"}

He first warns the Murakami family (father Atsushi, mother Tomoko, and son Mamoru) of their invasion, and demonstrates his powers by transporting them to a prehistoric jungle and destroying a Giant Dinosaur (in reality, Agon, the title monster of a Godzilla-like TV series) before their very eyes. But they will not agree to surrender to Goa, so hope comes in the form of Magma, an armored, golden giant with long hair and antennae. He and his human-sized wife Mol, both of whom were created by the wizard Earth (who indeed lives deep beneath the Earth), are sent to defend our world against Goa. They befriend Atsushi and Mamoru; the latter has touched Magma emotionally, as he wanted to have a child with his wife Mol, so Earth creates a duplicate of Mamoru, whom he names Gam, and who wears a white helmet, with built-in antennae, on his head. Earth gives Mamoru a whistle, with which he can call Gam (when blown once), Mol (when blown twice) and Magma (when blown thrice) in times of crisis. So when Goa unleashes his various daikaiju, chances are that Magma, Mol, and/or Gam will fly to the rescue.\n\nAmbassador Magma, despite his robot-like appearance, is not a true robot, but actually a living giant forged from gold. In fact, true to his original manga appearance, in the series pilot opening, Tetsuya Uozumi, the actor who played Magma, actually wore gold make-up on his face. But such difficulties as Uozomi's own face turning beet-red, drowning out the gold makeup, quickly arose. The solution proved to be an easy one; in all the show's subsequent episodes, Uozumi wore a golden human-like mask.\n\nMagma, just like his human-sized wife Mol and son Gam, transforms into a giant rocketship. Indeed, he is considered one of the earliest transforming mecha, even before the anime super robot, \"Brave Raideen,\" which set the standard for the genre.\n\nHe also shoots rockets out of a panel located in his chest, and (as do Mol and Gam) shoots electrical bolts from his antennae.\n\n\"The Space Giants\" is the English title of this series. The show is most notable for its humanoid robot heroes who responded to crises by transforming into rockets to combat a wide variety of dinosaur-like space monsters, and faceless, ninja-like villains called \"Lugo\" men (人間モドキ \"ningen-modoki\" literally \"mock-human\") whose corpses melted into oozing blob-like slime whenever they were killed.\n\nThe main conflict of the story involved an evil space villain named Rodak who continually tried to conquer Earth by sending a new dinosaur-like monster from deep space to attack Japan. The stories were generally resolved in two to four episodes, much like the BBC's \"Doctor Who,\" and a new monster would be found by Rodak to begin another two- to four-part struggle. Rodak's efforts were opposed by an ancient white-bearded wizard named Methusan (sometimes called Methuselah or Mathusem), aided by a trio of humanoid robots who were all capable of transformations from humanoid form into rocket forms.\n\nThe human interest in the story was a family of three: a boy named Mikko, his mother Tomoko, and his journalist father Ito Mura. The family became involved in the story due to the villain Rodak's desire to publish news of his presence to world media. The Mura family found themselves continually caught in the crossfire of monster attacks and harried by the Lugo men and Rodak's spies. A major sub-plot in the series developed when Mikko's mother was kidnapped by the \"Lugo\" men and held in uncertain conditions for a number of episodes.\n\nIn the first episodes, the robot team were a duo consisting of a gold robot aptly named Goldar and his companion, a silver-clad humanoid female named Silvar. It was implied that they had been created by the wizard Methusan. Early in the series, the wizard Methusan completed the team to mirror the Mura family by creating a humanoid rocket-boy named Gam, in the image of Mikko Mura, complete with his trademark red-and-white sweater vest. All members of the robot team were capable of transforming into rockets identified respectively by gold, silver, and red-and-white color schemes. Each had bulb-tipped antennae protruding from their heads, capable of discharging directed blasts of gamma rays. Goldar and Silvar were capable of firing missiles from their chest cavities, but Silvar was only shown doing this once. A regularly featured plot device was Mikko's ability to summon the robots by blowing a special high-frequency whistle: once to summon Gam, twice to summon Silvar and three times to summon Goldar.\n\nThe show first aired in Japan on July 4, 1966, and its international title was \"Space Avenger\" (one episode was dubbed for international markets). Originally intending to title it \"Monsters from Outer Space,\" the entire series was dubbed into English by Bernard H. Schulman's Lakeside Television Company and syndicated to a limited number of US television stations in early September 1970 (such as WSNS-TV Channel 44 in Chicago and WTAF-TV Channel 29 in Philadelphia), under the title \"The Space Giants.\" The show was not distributed widely to US television stations until the late 1970s, when it became a staple of fledgling Superstation TBS afternoon programming. 52 episodes were made, each running 25 minutes. It was known in Spanish as \"Monstruos del Espacio\" and in some English-speaking countries as \"Space Avenger.\"\n\nAs of late January and early February 2017, Bernard Schulman still owned the North American television and home video distribution rights to \"The Space Giants,\" under his Lakeside Television banner. At that time, rumors continued to circulate that the series would be issued in Blu-ray and Digital HD format for the 50th Anniversary in 2016, exclusively produced and distributed through AnimeImages and Lakeside Television Company in a joint partnership for production and distribution.\n\nAmbassador Magma makes a cameo appearance in the 2004 \"\" game for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance, along with a number of other characters created by Osamu Tezuka.\n\n\n\n\nA 13-episode OVA anime remake was produced in 1993. This series served as a retelling of the original series. The OVA was produced by Bandai Visual, Tezuka Productions and PLEX, and was directed by Hidehito Ueda.\n\n\nIn 1979 American comic book publisher FBN (Fantasy Book Novels) Publications produced a comic book adaptation (written and drawn by Angel Gabriele and artist Richard Lynn) of the first four episodes of \"Ambassador Magma\". In 1994, Gabriele did another \"Space Giants\" comic book one-shot published by Boneyard Press.\n\n\n"}

With an enrollment of more than 56,000 students annually, Central Piedmont is one of the largest community colleges in the North Carolina Community College System. The college has six campuses and three centers and offers nearly 300 degree, diploma and certificate programs.\n\nThe college was founded in 1963, the year the North Carolina General Assembly passed the state community college bill. It is the result of a merger between Mecklenburg College and the Central Industrial Education Center.\n\nFrom 1923 to 1959, Central High School was located on Elizabeth Avenue at Kings Drive, where Central Piedmont Community College is now located. In 1959 its students moved into the new Garinger High School. With the building vacant Charlotte College (later UNCC) used the space. Starting in 1959, the Central Industrial Education Center shared the old high school. As a result of the 1963 N.C. Community College Act, the Central Industrial Education Center and the black Mecklenburg College combined to become Central Piedmont Community College. The three-story Central High building is now the oldest building on the CPCC campus. CPCC trustees in July 2002 approved changing the building's name from Garinger Hall to the Central High School building, and a fund-raising campaign for the building's renovation was planned. The Central High School Legacy Fund funded renovation of the Central High building, used for administrative offices and admissions, and provided scholarship money. A rededication took place September 30, 2007, after restoration of the original facade.\n\nWTVI Charlotte's PBS affiliate, now run by Central Piedmont Community College, will become a laboratory for the college's new associate degree program launching in August 2015 in broadcasting and production technology.\n\nCentral Campus is in the Elizabeth neighborhood (adjacent to Independence Park and the Little Sugar Creek Greenway). The campus is set up more like a traditional university campus, housing many buildings on many different blocks. Currently, certain buildings on campus are being expanded and renovated, while others are being replaced all together.\n\nThere are street car rails in the pavement of Elizabeth Avenue, which bisects through the heart of campus. The rails are for the proposed Center City Corridor.\n\nOriginally named \"Northeast Campus,\" it is located near Reedy Creek Nature Reserve and was opened in Summer of 2002 with two buildings totaling 50,000 sq/ft. Built to relieve overcrowding at Central Campus, this location's focus area is horticulture due to its hilly and shady terrain, close proximity to local parks and ease of access to the rest of the county. It is also located in the University City section of Charlotte, the campus is only 3 miles from University of North Carolina at Charlotte, providing close proximity for students of both institutions to take classes at either campus.\n\nIn the Summer of 2005, the campus was renamed after Wayland H. Cato, a retailer who donates to the College. The campus also saw expansion and has since added another building, however the main focus of the Cato Campus is still horticulture and turf management.\n\nOpened in Winter of 1998 as the Southwest Campus, this satellite campus is located on Hebron St. off of Nations Ford Rd. in Southwest Charlotte. The campus focuses on construction technologies, welding, HVAC systems, graphic design and arts, and general studies.\n\nOpened as the 'South Campus' in the fall of 1998, this satellite campus is located in southeast Mecklenburg County, in Matthews, North Carolina. The campus opened with a 116,000 sq/ft building on a 32 acres, aimed at relieving the overcrowding at the Central Campus. The campus features a book store, computer lab and a food court in a three-story building. The campus was renamed and increased to 220,000 sq/ft with the aim to make the new Levine Campus into a full-fledged college campus. In late 2005 the Levine Campus grew again, when NASCAR owner Rick Hendrick donated money to build the $4 million, 25,000 sq/ft facility, 'Joe Hendrick Center for Automotive Technology'.\n\nWith the construction of I-485 right next door, the college has expanded the role for the campus, particularly for computer and information technology, as the Levine Campus houses the largest enrollment of this kind of all Central Piedmont campuses.\n\nThe first of Central Piedmont's satellite campuses, it was opened in 1990 as the North Center, eventually growing with the addition of the Public Safety building in 1996 and being renamed the North Campus. The campus is located north of Charlotte, in Huntersville, North Carolina. This campus is home to the College's Public Safety and Transportation Systems programs. In 2011 the College renamed the campus to the Merancas Campus, after longtime donor's Casey and Anke Mermans and their Merancas Foundation.\n\nHarris Campus opened in the West Charlotte area in 2001. It is located next to the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport. The campus houses meeting and convention spaces.\n\nCentral Piedmont is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) and offers online courses (fully online courses, partial online courses and hybrid online courses) to meet the needs of students.\n\n"}

The party was a member of the European People's Party (EPP).\n\nThe Democratic Party was formed by a breakaway from the Liberal Party led by Petko Karavelov in 1896. In the 1899 elections the party won 10 seats. It went on to win 27 in 1901, with Karavelov briefly serving as Prime Minister after the elections in a coalition government with the People's Liberal Party (PLP). However, the DP was reduced to seven seats in the 1902 elections. After remaining at seven seats following the 1903 elections and despite suffering a split in 1905 when the Young Democrats broke away to form the Radical Democratic Party, the party achieved a landslide in the 1908 elections, winning 166 of the 203 seats. Aleksandar Malinov became the party's second Prime Minister.\n\nMalinov was removed from office in 1911, and the party failed to win a seat in the Constitutional Assembly elections in June, although a joint list with the Radoslavist Liberal Party and the PLP won two seats. In parliamentary elections in September the party won four seats. It won 14 seats in the 1913 elections and 31 in the early elections in 1914.\n\nThe 1919 elections saw the party win 28 seats, before it was reduced to 24 seats in the 1920 elections. For the April 1923 elections the DP joined the Constitutional Bloc alliance formed in order to oppose the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union (BZNS). The alliance took 17 seats as the BZNS won a landslide victory. For the November 1923 elections the party was part of the victorious Democratic Alliance.\n\nIn the 1927 elections the party won 11 seats after running in an alliance with the Tomov faction of the BZNS and the Kyorchev faction of the National Liberal Party (NLP). Prior to the 1931 elections the party joined the People's Bloc, an alliance of the Dragiev faction of the BZNS, the Petrov faction of the NLP and the Radical Democratic Party.\n\nAfter World War II the party contested the 1946 Constitutional Assembly elections, but failed to win a seat. The party did not become part of the ruling Fatherland Front.\n\nAfter the fall of the Communist regime the party was re-established in 1990 and joined the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) alliance. The SDS won the second highest number of seats in the 1990 Constitutional Assembly elections before going onto win the parliamentary elections the following year. For the 1994 elections, the Democratic Party left the SDS and formed the People's Union alliance with the BZNS, winning eighteen seats. For the 1997 elections the Democratic Party joined the victorious United Democratic Forces (ODS) alliance alongside the SDS.\n\nThe party remained in the ODS for the 2001 elections, which it lost to the National Movement – Simeon II. The 2005 elections saw the ODS alliance reduced to 20 seats.\n"}

In his best-selling book \"The Damage Done\", Fellows describes the violence and harsh conditions he experienced in Thailand prisons.\n\nFellows was born in Sydney, Australia. His father Bill Fellows, was a champion jockey and horse trainer who won the 1949 Melbourne Cup on Foxzami. He was the youngest of three children, but his two-year-old sister Gail, died in 1950 from a \"bowel complication\". His older brother Gary died when he was 36 years old. Gary was living with his wife Carole and two sons Brett and Rodney. He also had a son named Adrian Simon who wrote \"Milk-Blood\". Fellows was educated at De La Salle College, a Catholic school for boys in Ashfield, New South Wales. Fellows claims he was nearly expelled from the school when he was caught running a horse betting operation from his school desk. Warren \"left\" De La Salle College and went to Randwick North High School.\n\nFellows worked in various jobs, including as a barman and an apprentice hairdresser in Double Bay. It was through his bar work that he first became involved with drug trafficking, successfully importing hash from India with a friend. On his return to Australia he married and had a child. Word got out about the successful drug run and a customer in the bar where Fellows worked employed him to travel to Los Angeles, Hawaii and South America to smuggle cocaine into Australia. Fellows came to know drug dealer William Sinclair, who took him to Bangkok, Thailand where he was introduced to Neddy Smith and made his first successful attempt at smuggling heroin into Australia.\n\nAfter returning to Australia, Neddy Smith who was impressed with his smuggling skills, contacted Fellows and offered him a job. Smith did not have the notoriety he had later, but was already a major and feared figure in the Sydney criminal world. Fellows claims he became involved with Smith because he was \"young and impressionable\" and flattered that he \"was liked by a man most people were terrified of\". Fellows worked for Smith as a drug courier, domestically and internationally.\n\nIn October 1978, Smith instructed Fellows to again travel to Bangkok, this time in the company of Smith's brother-in-law Paul Hayward. Hayward played professional rugby league with the Newtown Jets and had been selected to represent Australia as a boxer at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Hayward had done \"favours\" for Smith, but this was his first international job. Fellows and Hayward became best friends. Prior to leaving Australia, Fellows was tipped off by a friend with a police contact at Manly, that the Commonwealth Police believed he was involved in a large drug importation operation and had him under surveillance. Fellows reported this to Smith who dismissed it, claiming that he would have been informed if it were true. Smith insisted they continue with the job.\n\nHayward and Fellows became increasingly apprehensive, but after Smith lost his patience with them and made implied threats, they reluctantly agreed to go through with the trip. Fellows was particularly anxious about returning to Bangkok. During his last trip in February 1978, he had been forced to abandon a package of heroin he had been attempting to ship back to Australia and feared that Thai police may have found it and been able to trace the drugs back to him. So Fellows procured a false passport through a friend, in the name of a deceased child Gregory Hastings Barker. Smith later said that Fellows got done because he booked his flight using Smith's telephone, although Fellows says that he can not remember whether he booked it with Smiths phone or not.\n\nOn arriving in Thailand, Fellows and Hayward met William Sinclair by chance. Sinclair now lived in Bangkok and owned the Texas Bar. Sinclair took them to his bar, and in a drunken state, attempted to obtain information from them about their trip. Unbeknown to them, the trio were under surveillance and the meeting appeared to police to incriminate Sinclair, even though according to Fellows, he was not involved. Fellows claims that there were many warning signs and that the night before they were arrested he had a \"moment of clarity\" and resolved to wash the heroin down the bath drain. But he fell asleep and was woken in the morning by police.\n\nOn 12 October 1978, the rooms occupied by Fellows and Hayward at the Montien Hotel in Bangkok were raided by Thai police. The pair were arrested when 8.5 kilograms of heroin was found in a suitcase in Hayward's room. Fellows alleges they were subjected to physical and psychological abuse at the hands of Thai Narcotics Suppression Unit officers who demanded they sign statements which they could not read because they were written in Thai. The officers demanded Fellows and Hayward make statements incriminating Sinclair. Fellows claims they resisted because Sinclair was innocent, but he eventually relented when officers informed them they were to be executed without trial under Article 27 of the military law and dragged Hayward outside for execution. Fellows and Hayward agreed to sign the statement and Sinclair was arrested and charged.\n\nThe three men were sent to Bambat remand centre at Klong Prem Central Prison, but after plotting an escape attempt were moved to \"Maha Chai\" the Special Bangkok Metropolitan Prison on Maha Chai Road (now the Bangkok Corrections Museum). They spent three years in Maha Chai before they were convicted of heroin trafficking. Sinclair and Fellows were sentenced to life imprisonment and Hayward was sentenced to 30 years' jail. They were sent to the Lard Yao prison but after five days there when Sinclair attempted to bribe the wrong guard, they were transferred to Bangkwang. Two years later, Sinclair's conviction was overturned on appeal in 1983. Hayward was later returned to Lard Yao, and later received a royal pardon and was released from Lard Yao on 7 April 1989. Fellows received a royal pardon and was released from Bangkwang on 11 January 1990.\n\nWhilst imprisoned in Thailand, Fellows attempted suicide several times, one he recalls was when he was locked into a darkroom he wrapped a sarong around his neck and tied it to a hook on the ceiling; however, he claimed as he felt his bowels fall the sarong snapped, causing him to fall, saving him. Fellows became addicted to heroin. He claimed that heroin was easily available in Thai prisons and was the only form of escape from the appalling conditions. In his autobiography \"The Damage Done\", he expressed great sympathy for those afflicted by addiction to drugs. He writes that it was \"an outstanding case of poetic justice\" that he should become addicted himself.\n\nOn his return to Australia, he spent two weeks in a hospital being treated for malnutrition and pneumonia. He expressed concern regarding his and Paul Hayward's ability to adapt back into society, an issue which he claims played a part in Hayward's death in 1992 from a heroin overdose. Fellows explains how he still has hallucinations of strange abnormal creatures hovering over him and watching him. Furthermore, Fellows claims that he has the same nightmare once a month, regarding him lying on a beach with two beautiful women feeling free and happy, however as he begins to walk off into the sunset he turns around and notices that the two girls have disappeared and that he is back in the Thailand Prison where a guard is calling his name telling him to go in his cell. Fellows says that although he is released from Bangkwang he will never be free from the tortures in his mind. In the late 2000s, Fellows commented in the media on the cases of the Bali Nine and Schapelle Corby.\n\nSheffield four-piece band Harrisons penned a song entitled \"Simmer Away\" after reading \"The Damage Done\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2134635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2134635", "title": "FeardotCom", "text": "FeardotCom\n\nFeardotCom is a 2002 horror film directed by William Malone and starring Stephen Dorff, Natascha McElhone and Stephen Rea. The plot details a New York City detective investigating a series of mysterious deaths connected to a disturbing website. Director Malone's second feature for Warner Bros. after the release of \"House on Haunted Hill\" (1999), \"FeardotCom\" was an international co-production between companies based in the United States, Luxembourg, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The film was shot on location in Luxembourg and Montreal, Canada. \"Feardotcom\" was released in the United States on August 30, 2002 to overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics and grossed $18.9 million worldwide against its $40 million budget.\n\nMike Reilly is an NYPD detective who is called to the scene of a mysterious death in the subway system. The victim, Polidori, exhibits bleeding from his eyes and other orifices and, by the frozen look on his face, appears to have seen something horrifying before being hit by a train. Department of Health researcher Terry Huston is intrigued by the find as well, particularly when several more victims show up with identical symptoms.\n\nWhen a contagious virus is ruled out, Terry and Mike team up to discover what might be killing these people. Initially they are unable to find anything to connect the deaths together; after some more digging for clues, they eventually discover that all of the victims' computers crashed shortly before their passings. They send each of the victims' hard drives to Mike's friend, Denise Stone, who is a forensic specialist.\n\nDenise discovers that all of the victims had visited a website called Feardotcom.com, which depicts voyeuristic torture murder. Upon looking at the site herself, Denise is subjected to various sights and sounds of torture that eventually drive her insane, resulting in her falling to her death from her apartment window.\n\nMike feels guilty, thinking that he should have never gotten Denise involved in the case. Terry figures out that people who visit the website die within 48 hours, apparently from what they feared most in their lives. Despite such dangerous knowledge, both she and Mike visit the site in order to figure out what is happening.\n\nAs they begin to experience paranoia and hallucinations (like the deceased), including that of a young girl and her inflatable ball, they race against time to figure out if any of it has any connection to an extremely vicious serial killer, Alistair Pratt, who has been eluding Mike and the FBI for years.\n\nIt is revealed that Feardotcom is, in fact, a ghost site made by one of Pratt's first victims, who is seeking revenge because people watched her being tortured and murdered. She was tortured by Pratt for 48 hours before she begged him to kill her, which explains why the victims have 48 hours to live. Mike and Terry track down Pratt and release the spirit of the murdered girl from the website, which kills Pratt. However, Mike is also killed.\n\nThe ending scene shows Terry lying in her bed with her cat. The phone rings but she hears no one on the line, only online static. She hangs up and hugs the cat.\n\nMalone stated that his goal when agreeing to direct was to make the entire film look \"basically like a nightmare.\" Stephen Dorff was cast as the lead in the film, while Stephen Rea was cast as the villain based on Malone's appreciation of him as one of his \"favorite actors.\" Natascha McElhone was cast as the lead female role, and Malone stated in retrospect that he felt she had been miscast: \"I mean, I love[d] having her in the film, don't get me wrong, but the film should have been rewritten for her, instead of being written for somebody who was showing off how good she is at her job. Natascha has this sort of competence and elegance, so you just don't buy that with her.\" Jeffrey Combs, who had appeared in Malone's previous feature, \"House on Haunted Hill\", was cast in a supporting part as a detective.\n\nThough set in New York City, the film was shot in Montreal, Québec, Canada, and in Luxembourg. Director William Malone had not intended to shoot the film in Luxembourg, but stated that the producers had scouted locations there which they believed \"looked like\" New York; as a result, Malone said the film ended up being a \"weird take on New York rather than \"being\" New York.\" Some scenes, such as those in the subway stations, were shot on constructed sets built on sound stages. Malone stated in an audio commentary that the majority of the interiors scenes were also shot on sets.\n\nThe website featured in the film was designed by a Berlin-based digital design company.\n\nThe film was released on August 9, 2002 in South Korea and on August 30, 2002 in the United States. It would receive subsequent theatrical releases in numerous countries throughout the ensuing months, debuting in the United Kingdom on June 27, 2003.\n\nThe film was released on DVD in January 2003.\n\nThe film was originally rated NC-17 due to extreme violence. After multiple trims and appeals, the film was finally re-rated R by the MPAA for \"violence including grisly images of torture, nudity and language\".\n\nThe film opened at number 5 at the US box office, grossing $5.7 million its opening weekend showing on 2,550 screens. It earned an additional $2.3 million the following weekend (September 6–8), and $982,450 the subsequent weekend (September 13–15). The film screened in US theaters until Halloween, though by the weekend of October 25, the number of screens it was showing on had reduced to 92 in total.\n\nThe film's total domestic gross was $13.3 million, and $5.6 international, totaling $18.9 million worldwide.\n\nThe film was tremendously panned by critics. As of 2018, it holds a 3% approval rating on movie review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 101 reviews, with a weighted average of 2.65/10. The critics' consensus reads: \"As frustrating as a 404 error, \"Fear Dot Com\" is a stylish, incoherent, and often nasty mess with few scares.\" At Metacritic, the film holds a 16/100 rating based on 20 reviews, indicating \"overwhelming dislike\". Roger Ebert criticized the film for its lack of originality, specifically, and its overt violence. Mark Kermode of \"The Observer\" and Cynthia Fuchs of \"PopMatters\" wrote of the premise's similarity to the Japanese film \"Kairo\" and David Cronenberg's \"Videodrome\", as well as Hideo Nakata's \"Ringu\".\n\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"F\" grade on an A+ to F scale; , it is one of only 19 films to receive such a rating.\n\n\"Empire\" magazine gave the film one out of five stars, calling it \"arguably the least imaginative, most pathetic horror of the decade.\" \"The Guardian\" called it a \"nasty, badly acted horror film [...] like Marc Evans' \"My Little Eye\" or Olivier Assayas' execrable \"Demonlover\", it manages to be both prurient and very, very naive about the internet.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars and wrote, \"strange, how good \"FeardotCom\" is, and how bad. The screenplay is a mess, and yet the visuals are so creative this is one of the rare bad films you might actually want to see\" and praising the last 20 minutes as something which, if it \"had been produced by a German impressionist in the 1920s, we'd be calling it a masterpiece.\" He added, \"The movie is extremely violent; it avoided the NC-17 rating and earned an R, I understand, after multiple trims and appeals, and even now it is one of the most graphic horror films I've seen.\"\n\nJami Bernard of The \"New York Daily News\" said, \"The story is a mess, some of the images offensive, the acting under par and the dialogue silly.\" Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" said, \"\"Feardotcom\" is the cinematic equivalent of spam in your e-mail inbox.\" Furthermore, Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" said, \"What we get in \"FearDotCom\" is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie. In other words, it's badder than bad,\" while Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" said that it \"is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense.\"\n\nWriting for \"The Globe and Mail\", Liam Lacey wrote of the film's potential for cult status, adding: \"but the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase \"fatal script error.\"\" Andrew Manning of Radio Free Entertainment stated, \"Of all the trash I had to watch in 2002, the insipid \"FearDotCom\" easily ranks among the worst,\" and Oz of eFilmCritic.com stated: \"In a year that has given us some of the worst films of all time, this must surely rank as the worst -- and that's a hard thing to do opposite \"Master of Disguise\".\"\n\nIn his book \"The Cinema Dreams Its Rivals: Media Fantasy Films from Radio to the Internet\", film scholar Paul Young praised the film's dark cinematography, writing: \"FearDotCom\" refuses to let CG penetrate its mise-en-scène... \"FearDotCom\" is set in New York, but instead of providing digitized skylines and enhanced locales to fudge the differences, \"FearDotCom\" simply plunges the city into the dark... In effect, [it] manages to incarnate a sense of what film \"was\" before CG, a sense it underscores by building its Monogram B-film environment around the Internet.\n\n\"FeardotCom\" won \"Worst Film\" at the 2003 Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association Awards and 'Grand Prize of European Fantasy Film in Silver' at 2003 Fantafestival. It was nominated for \"Grand Prize of European Fantasy Film in Gold\" at the 2004 Amsterdam Fantastic Film Festival and 'Best Film' at the 2002 Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival.\n\n\n\n"}

The terms have no taxonomic basis, although most shell-dwelling cichlids are from Lake Tanganyikas lamprologine lineage. Many shell dwelling cichlids are popular with fishkeepings and are frequently kept in aquaria.\n\nIn Lake Tanganyika the shells inhabited are from the genus \"Neothauma\", while shells used by \"Pseudotropheus lanisticola\" in Lake Malawi are from genus \"Lanistes\".\n\nAround 24 species of lamprologine cichlids use abandoned shells for shelter and breeding in Lake Tanganyika. Most, however, are not obligate shell-breeding cichlids and will spawn in other caves or crevices.\n\nThere are several groups the shell dwellers can be placed into:\n\nShell dwellers are found throughout Lake Tanganyika, along the coasts of Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi and Tanzania.\n\nShell dwellers are carnivores that primarily feed on zooplankton and other microscopic and near-microscopic foods.\n\nCichlids' distinctive pharyngeal teeth, in the throat of the fish, are present in shell dwellers, though small. Armed with those and the usual teeth along with the typical dissolving qualities of water shell dwellers can eat a variety of foods in the wild and in captivity. Many species have been known to pull small snails from their shells to eat, to catch and devour the fry of other fish, and to go after small crustaceans.\n\nAs with other cichlids they protect their young, and the distinctive shell-dwelling provides them with a defensible nursery.\n\nGenerally eggs are laid by the female within the shell and fertilized as she lays them or immediately after by the male.\n\nThe female will protect the shell, fanning her pectoral fins to keep the internal water oxygenated, and often rearranging the substrate to create barriers or to hide the shell from predators.\n\nEggs hatch within 48 hours, dependent primarily on temperature, and the yolk sac is absorbed within five days. Fry typically emerge from the shell a week after spawning, although they remain quite benthic for days or weeks after their emergence.\n\nThe Malawi shell dweller, \"Pseudotropheus lanisticola\", was first identified in 1964 along with many other mbuna in that lake, but the Tanganyikan shell dwellers were found primarily in the late 1970s and early 1980s. \"Altolamprologus compressiceps\" was identified in 1958 but the shell-dwelling varieties were found much later.\n\nThe shell-dwelling species' needs are very similar. The basic aquarium setup and equipment are appropriate with a few changes. First, the substrate should be sand. Many of the species are very accomplished diggers and for security may bury all or part of a shell, use sand as a territorial barrier, or generally amuse the owner by spitting, sifting, or throwing it. Second, hard, alkaline water must be provided, which should also be kept free of ammonia and nitrites and with low nitrates. Finally, appropriate shells must be provided. Common shells used for shell dwellers include authentic \"Neothauma\" shells, ocean turbo shells, escargot shells, whale eye shells, and Ampullariidae-family shells. Shells must be of an appropriate size for the species, have a round opening, and have open coils. Numbers of shells will vary; for colonial species, hundreds may be ideal. For brevis types, a single shell per pair is often representative.\n\n"}

In 1999, he was ranked as the 5th best south american player in the 20th Century (behind Pelé, Maradona, Di Stéfano and Garrincha), and among the 25 best players in the world through a poll by the IFFHS. He was known as a player of great technique, great vision, and lethal in the penalty area. Despite his reputation for drinking, smoking and not going to training, Moreno was also known for his formidable heading ability and fine physical qualities.\n\nMoreno was born in the neighbourhood of La Boca, in Buenos Aires, and grew up in the surroundings of the club Boca Juniors' stadium, \"La Bombonera\". At the age of 15, he tried out for the lower divisions of Boca Juniors, but did not make the selection. According to the Argentine Football Association archives, he said, frustrated: \"\"some time you will regret it\"\". Moreno then became part of the lower divisions of River Plate, Boca Junior's arch-rival, in 1933, having been recommended by Bernabé Ferreyra, a notable forward for River Plate.\n\nAt the age of 18, Moreno was selected along with other young players from the club by manager Emérico Hirschl to make a tour in Brazil. His first competitive appearance was against Brazilian side Botafogo. He debuted in \"Primera División\" on March 17, 1935, in a 2-1 win against C.A. Platense, scoring one goal. Quickly become the greatest figure of Argentine soccer, he was part of the squad that won league titles in 1936 and 1937, and went on to become a key player among Adolfo Pedernera on the River Plate squad known as \"La Máquina\", famous for his line of attack composed by Moreno, Pedernera, Ángel Labruna, Juan Carlos Muñoz, and Félix Loustau, and which dominated Argentine football during the first half of the 1940s decade, winning with Moreno two national titles (1941, 1942) and many Aldao Cups.\nIn 1944, Moreno was transferred to México Primera División club España, who had finished runner up to Asturias, first Mexican league champions in the 1943-44 season. With España, Moreno won the national title in the 1945-46 season. His time and success in Mexico earned him the nickname \"Charro\", which is also the term used to refer to the traditional cowboy of Mexico.\n\nMoreno returned to his homeland and River Plate for the latter part of 1946. His second tenure at River lasted three seasons. Champion again in 1947, already with Alfredo Di Stéfano as center forward, he returned to emigrate after the strike of 1948 players. He was transferred to Universidad Católica of Chile, where in the same year he helped the team win its first league title. He returned to Argentina in 1950, this time to play for Boca Juniors, and the following year, he played again for Universidad Católica. He also played one season in Uruguay, with Primera División team Defensor. In 1953, he went back to Argentina to join Ferrocarril Oeste.\n\nMoreno moved to Colombia in 1954, joining Independiente Medellín, where he would end his playing career. He was both a player and a manager for the club. He won the Colombian championship in 1955, becoming the only footballer to have won league titles in four different countries' leagues, doing so in Argentina, Mexico, Chile, and Colombia. In 1957, he won his last – and 12th overall – first division title. He retired with Independiente Medellín in a friendly match against Boca Juniors in 1961, a match during which he participated both as coach and player. Independiente won the match 5-2, and Moreno scored one goal.\n\nMoreno was a member of the Argentina national team from 1936 to 1950, earning 34 caps and scoring 19 goals. Moreno was part of the winning squads at the South American Championships (now Copa América) of 1941, 1942 and 1947. He scored the tournament's milestone goal number 500 in an atypical match against Ecuador: he scored five goals in that match, a Copa América record which he shares with Héctor Scarone (Uruguay), Juan Marvezzi (Argentina) and Evaristo (Brazil). That day, Argentina beat Ecuador 12-0, which is also the largest goal difference in a single Copa América match.\n\nMoreno was the top goalscorer of the 1942 South American Championship with seven goals, along with Herminio Masantonio, and was chosen best player of the 1947 edition. He is also tied for third place among the Copa América's all-time top scorers, with 13 overall goals.\n\nMoreno had a brief spell as manager of Argentina in 1959. He also worked as the manager of Boca Juniors, Huracán and All Boys in Argentina and Colo-Colo in Chile.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of the most photographed peaks in the country.\n\nThe distinctive shape of the peak in southern New Zealand gives the mountain its name, after the mitre headwear of Christian bishops. It was named by Captain John Lort Stokes of HMS \"Acheron\". The Māori name for the peak is Rahotu.\n\nPart of the reason for its iconic status is its location. Close to the shore of Milford Sound, in the Fiordland National Park in the southwestern South Island, it is a stunning sight. The mountain rises near vertically to , i.e. just over a mile, from the water of Milford Sound, which technically is a fjord.\n\nThe peak is actually a closely grouped set of five peaks, with Mitre Peak not even the tallest one, however from most easily accessible viewpoints, Mitre Peak appears as a single point. Milford Sound is part of Te Wahipounamu, a World Heritage Site as declared by UNESCO.\n\nThe only road access to Milford Sound is via State Highway 94, in itself one of the most scenic roads in New Zealand.\n\nMitre Peak is difficult to reach and as a result ascent attempts are relatively infrequent. \n\nThe first known attempt of the peak was in 1883 by Invercargill artist Samuel Mereton, and Donald Sutherland. The pair took a boat to Sinbad Bay on 6 February and camped at the head of the valley. The next day with little equipment, no coats and one biscuit each they climbed to the crest of the Mitre Range, from where they could see Mitre Peak over 3 km away to the east. With it being too late in the day to descend, they were forced to sleep where they were overnight, before the next day abandoning the attempt to avoid an approaching storm. After a difficult descent they were forced to sit out two more days in bad weather at the head of Sinbad Gully before rowing back across Milford Sound to the hotel operated by Sunderland's wife.\n\nIn 1911, Jim Dennistoun walked in to Milford Sound from Lake Te Anau over Mackinnon Pass, and inquired among the track porters in the hope of finding someone to climb the peak with him. None of the porters had any climbing experience, but one of them, Joe Beaglehole (1875–1962), had read \"Scrambles among the Alps\" by noted climber Edward Whymper and was thus chosen by Dennistoun to accompany him. \n\nDuring a sea voyage in the area with brother George in HMS Pioneer in 1909 Dennistoun had identified what he thought was a possible route but as he wasn't able to reconnoitre it he instead decided to take a route recommended by Donald Sutherland.\n\nAfter rowing across in a boat to the mouth of Sinbad Gully at the base of the peak they starting climbing at 7.30am on 13 March 1911. Dennistoun and Beaglehole climbed via the south east-ridge through the bush until 300 metres short of the summit Beaglehole decided it was too difficult to continue and stopped. Dennistoun continued on alone up steep, smooth slabs of granite, to reach the summit at 1.15pm.\n\nDescending back down Dennistoun rejoined Beaglehole and they continued with the descent. Unfortunately to avoid climbing back over the Footstool, they decided to descend straight into Sinbad Gully, which meant they had to resort to using a rope to lower themselves down bluffs. They eventually reached the valley floor in darkness, and it soon commenced to rain. With no camping equipment, they had no choice but to continue on until they reached the boat at 9.45pm, cold, wet and exhausted. They then rowed back across to spend the night at the hotel operated by Elizabeth Sunderland.\n\nDennistoun's claim to have reached the top was disputed by Donald Sutherland who had bluntly claimed that Mitre Peak could not be climbed. In 1914 Dennistoun's handkerchief was found in a small cairn on the top of the peak by Jack Murrell (1886–1918) and Edger Williams (1891–1983) when they completed the second ascent of the peak.\nWhen J.H. Christie and G. Raymond completed the third ascent in 1941 they found remains of the handkerchief, as well as two halfpennies left by Murrell and Williams.\n\nThere are six routes up to Mitre Peak, and most climbers start by getting a boat to Sinbad Bay.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2134693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2134693", "title": "Corsican immigration to Puerto Rico", "text": "Corsican immigration to Puerto Rico\n\nCorsican immigration to Puerto Rico resulted in the 19th century from widespread economic and political changes in Europe that made life difficult for the peasant and agricultural classes in Corsica and other territories. The Second Industrial Revolution drew more people into urban areas for work, widespread crop failure resulted from long periods of drought, and crop diseases, and political discontent rose. In the early nineteenth century, Spain lost most of its possessions in the so-called \"New World\" as its colonies won independence. It feared rebellion in its last two Caribbean colonies: Puerto Rico and Cuba. The Spanish Crown had issued the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 (\"Real Cédula de Gracias\") which fostered and encouraged the immigration of European Catholics, even if not of Spanish origin, to its Caribbean colonies.\n\nHundreds of families emigrated from Corsica to Puerto Rico. Corsicans and those of Corsican descent played an instrumental role in the development of the economy of the island, especially in the coffee industry.\n\nJuan Fantauzzi was the first documented Corsican to immigrate to Puerto Rico. He was born about 1734 in Morsiglia, Corsica. He immigrated to what is now Aguadilla in the 1760s, where he married Josefa Martínez. Two known children of theirs are Francisco and Juan María Fantauzzi. He died November 5, 1798. His death certificate confirms his Corsican origin.\n\nCorsica is an island located west of Italy and southeast of mainland France. Corsica belonged to the Republic of Genoa (before Genoa became part of Italy) and in 1768 was ceded to France to pay off debt. The island's people relied largely on an agricultural economy for survival.\n\nFrom the end of the 18th century through the beginning of the 19th century, changes occurred in Europe that would greatly affect the lives of the French and the people of Corsica. With the Second Industrial Revolution, many former agricultural workers began to move to the larger cities with hopes of finding better-paying jobs and making better lives. A widespread crop failure took place because of long periods of drought and crop diseases (e.g., the Phylloxera epidemic destroyed the Corsican wine industry and much of the French). A cholera epidemic had high mortality and there was a general deterioration of economic conditions. Many of the farms in Corsica began to fail.\n\nThe resulting widespread political discontent erupted in bitter armed conflict between the people and their governments, particularly in the Revolutions of 1848. King Louis-Philippe of France was overthrown in that revolution and a republic was declared with a Provisional Government. Three new political groups emerged during that era: they were the liberals, radicals, and the socialists. The combination of man-made and natural disasters in Corsica left an acute feeling of hopelessness. All this came about at a time when Spain was growing fearful of the possibility of a rebellion in her Caribbean colonies, Puerto Rico and Cuba.\n\nBy 1825, Spain had lost the entirety of her territories in Mexico, Central and South America. It struggled to prevent rebellion in the Caribbean colonies. It decided to encourage immigration to the islands by European Catholics, for instance from Ireland, Corsica, and Italy, thinking they could establish a loyal base grateful for the opportunity. In 1815, the Spanish Crown had issued the Royal Decree of Graces (Real Cédula de Gracias) which fostered the immigration of non-Spanish European Catholics to its Caribbean colonies.\n\nAs the island of Puerto Rico is very similar in geography to Corsica, it appealed to new immigrants. Under the Spanish Royal Decree of Graces, the Corsicans and other immigrants were granted land and initially given a \"Letter of Domicile\" after swearing loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Catholic Church. After five years they could request a \"Letter of Naturalization\" and become Spanish subjects.\nHundreds of Corsicans and their families immigrated to Puerto Rico from as early as 1830, and their numbers peaked in the early 1900s. The first Spanish settlers had settled and owned the land in the coastal areas, as they wanted access to the sea. The Corsicans tended to settle the mountainous southwestern region of the island, primarily in the towns of Adjuntas, Lares, Utuado, Ponce, Coamo, Yauco, Guayanilla, and Guánica. Yauco, with a rich agricultural area, attracted the majority of the Corsican settlers. The three main commodity crops in Yauco were coffee, sugar cane and tobacco. \n\nThe new settlers dedicated themselves to the cultivation of these crops and within a short period of time some began to save enough money to own and operate their own grocery stores. Coffee was the means by which some made their fortunes. Cultivation of coffee in Yauco originally began in the Rancheras and Diego Hernández sectors, and later extended to the Aguas Blancas, Frailes and Rubias sectors. By the 1860s the Corsican settlers were the leaders of the coffee industry in Puerto Rico: seven out of ten coffee plantations were owned by Corsicans.\n\nThe Mariani family of Yauco used two tactics to strengthen their position in the coffee industry. First, they converted a cotton gin in order to use it for mechanical dehusking of coffee cherries, a labor-intensive process. Second, they sent two of their family as representatives to visit the important European coffee buying centers and establish connections. The visit to Europe was a success and Mariania led Puerto Rico to become an important member of the worldwide coffee industry.\n\nThe descendants of the Corsican settlers also became influential in the fields of education, literature, journalism and politics. Historian Colonel Héctor A. Negroni, (USAF-Retired), researched the Corsican-Puerto Rican connection and has documented substantial information about Puerto Rico's ties with Corsica. Today the town of Yauco is known as both the \"Corsican Town\" and \"The Coffee Town\". A memorial was installed in Yauco with the inscription, \"To the memory of our citizens of Corsican origin, France, who in the 19th Century became rooted in our village, who have enriched our culture with their traditions and helped our progress with their dedicated work – the municipality of Yauco pays them homage.\" Corsican surnames such as Paoli, Negroni and Fraticelli are common in the island.\n\nSeveral properties in Yauco and Ponce, which once belonged to Corsican immigrants, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe Casa Franceschi Antongiorgi (Franceschi Antongiorgi House) was built in 1907 by the French architect André Troublard for Alejandro Franceschi Antongiorgi, a rich landowner and lover of the arts. He frequently held banquets, concerts and meetings with visiting artists in his house.\n\nThe Casa Antonio Mattei Lluberas, also called La Casona Césari (Césari House) was built in 1893 by Antonio Mattei Lluberas. This house is also known as \"The House with Twelve Doors.\" Later, it was acquired by Ángel Césari Poggi, husband of Ángela Antongiorgi Rodríguez. The Césari Antongiorgi family was instrumental in the development of the sugar industry in the southern region of the island.\n\nThe Chalet Amill was built in 1914 by architect Tomás Olivari Santoni for Ángel Antongiorgi Paoli. Antongiorgi Paoli gave the chalet to his daughter Ana Lucía as a wedding gift when she married Juan Amill Rodríguez. The couple soon divorced. By the mid-1920s, the chalet was converted into a hotel, first named as the Auristela Hotel and then as the Paris Hotel. This hotel was owned by Lola Bartolomei, the daughter of Francisco Bartolomei. The Bartolomei family were first-generation Corsican immigrants who owned coffee plantations in this area.\n\nThe Mansión Negroni (Negroni Mansion), also known as Casa Agostini (Agostini House), was built around 1850 by Antonio Francisco Negroni Mattei. Later it passed to the Agostini family through the marriage of María Victoria Negroni, daughter of Antonio Francisco, and Ignacio Agostini Felipi. The Agostini family made their fortune in the exportation of coffee. They were the owners of \"\"Sobrinos de Agostini y Compañía\"\" (Nephews of Agostini & Co.). Ángel Pedro Agostini Natali, a member of the family, is credited with inventing the coffee grinder. This machine revolutionized the coffee industry. As a consequence, the island was able to meet the huge demand for Puerto Rican coffee, which resulted in the \"Golden Age\" of Yauco's economy. This house was acquired for use by the Holy Rosary School in Yauco, and a bronze plaque describes its history.\n\nThe Residencia Lluberas Negroni, erroneously called the Residencia González Vivaldi (González Vivaldi Residence), was built in 1880 by Arturo Lluberas for his wife Asunción Negroni. Most recently, it was acquired by the González Vivaldi family.\n\nThe Casa Paoli was built ca. 1864 and is located on 2648 Calle Mayor, Barrio Cuarto in Ponce. It is nationally significant as the birthplace of Antonio Paoli Marcano, who became an internationally acclaimed tenor and opera singer. He performed and was widely praised in Europe and the Americas, including Caribbean islands. The house had been a wedding gift for Paoli's parents, who married at the Ponce Cathedral after the birth of the first five of their eight children. (His maternal grandfather had initially opposed the marriage because his daughter was much wealthier than Paoli's immigrant Corsican father. The couple eloped together.) Antonio, their seventh child, was born in this house, as were two of his siblings. In 2009, Casa Paoli was included in the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe following is a list of some of the notable people from Yauco of Corsican descent:\n\nBesides having distinguished careers in agriculture and the military, Puerto Ricans of Corsican descent have made many other contributions to the Puerto Rican way of life. Their contributions can be found in, but are not limited to, the fields of education, commerce, politics and entertainment. The Vivoni family has four notable members: Carlos Vivoni, the former Secretary of Economic Development and Commerce and, as well, former Secretary of Housing, Pedro Santos Vivoni, the first mayor of Lajas, Pierre Vivoni, a Judge and former Police Commissioner, and José Antonio Vivoni Ramírez de Arellano, the former mayor of San Germán.\n\nOther Puerto Ricans of Corsican descent who have led notable political careers were Ernesto Ramos Antonini, who was the first President of the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico and co-founder of the Partido Popular Democrático de Puerto Rico (Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico), Jaime Fuster Berlingeri, an associate justice of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court and former Resident Commissioner, Jorge Farinacci, the head of the Puerto Rican Socialist Party, and Jorge Santini, the former mayor of San Juan.\n\nOne of the first Puerto Rican entertainers to achieve world-wide fame was Antonio Paoli Marcano, an opera singer known as \"The King of Tenors\" and as \"The Tenor of Kings.\" He was the first operatic artist to record an entire opera when he participated in a performance of \"Pagliacci\" by Ruggiero Leoncavallo in Italy in 1907. The Palmieri brothers, Charlie and Eddie Palmieri, were band leaders in the United States. Rock N Roll Hall of Famer Joe Negroni was a member of the rock and roll group \"The Teenagers.\" Both Américo Boschetti and Vicente Carattini were singers and composers. Carattini composed Puerto Rican Christmas-related songs. Carmen Delia Dipiní was also a notable singer of boleros.\n\nThe following is a list of some of the surnames of the first Corsican families who immigrated to the Adjuntas, Yauco, Guayanilla, and Guánica areas of Puerto Rico in the 19th Century. This list was compiled by genealogist and historian Colonel (USAF Ret.) Héctor A. Negroni who has done exhaustive research on the Corsican migration and origins of his Negroni family name.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2134696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2134696", "title": "Leaf curl", "text": "Leaf curl\n\nPeach leaf curl is a plant disease characterized by distortion and coloration of leaves and is caused by the fungus \"Taphrina deformans\", which infects peach, nectarine, and almond trees. \"T. deformans\" is found in the United States, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Peach leaf curl reduces the amount of leaves and fruit produced by peach and nectarine trees.\n\nPeach leaf curl can mainly affect peach, nectarine, and to a lesser extent almond trees. In an isolated case in Hungary in 2011, peach leaf curl was also identified in apricot trees.\n\nPeach leaf curl is a distinctive and easily noticeable fungal disease, and the severity of the symptoms depends on how early infection has occurred. Diseased leaves can usually be identified soon after they emerge from the bud, due to their red color and twisted shape. As the leaves develop, they become increasingly distorted, and ultimately thick and rubbery compared to normal leaves. The color of the leaves changes from the normal green to red and purple, until a whitish bloom covers each leaf. Finally, the dead leaf may dry and turn black before it is cast off. Changes in the bark are less noticeable, if at all. Fruit may fail to develop from diseased blossoms. Any fruit that does develop from a diseased tree is usually normal, but sometimes may also be affected, showing a reddish color. Infected leaves fall early. The tree usually produces a second flush of leaves that is rarely diseased, except in an unseasonably cool and wet spring, because the fungus is not infectious at the normally higher temperatures in late spring and early summer.\n\nThe fungus \"T. deformans\" causes deformed young leaves, red blisters, and ultimately the whitish bloom that covers the leaf as the infection progresses. This white color is made of asci that break through the cuticle of the leaf. One ascus consists of eight ascospores that create conidia, which are ejected in early summer and spread by rain and wind. The fungus survives the winter on the surface of the host plant, such as on bark or buds. In late winter or early spring, rainwater washes spores into the buds as they burst. Once this happens, no treatment is effective. In the spring, about two weeks after blossom, new leaves emerging from the infected buds are infected by the conidia. The disease may not occur every year due to variation in temperature and rainfall. Specifically, for successful infection, the fungus requires wet winters, where rain (not fog or dew) wets the tree for more than 12.5 hours at temperatures below . The fungus cannot grow at temperatures below .\n\nVarious methods are applied.\n\nIf a tree has peach leaf curl in a particular year, the disease will inexorably take its course, but measures can be taken to sustain the tree or maximize crop yield: protecting the tree from further rain at temperatures below , providing nitrogen and excess water to minimize stress on the tree; applying greasebands around the trunk to protect from insect infestation; and thinning the fruit. It is unclear whether removal of infected leaves from the tree is beneficial. Removing the infected leaves and fruit after they fall to the ground is sometimes also suggested but superfluous if, in the following winter, fungicides or rain protection are applied.\n\nPeach leaf curl was first introduced in America in 1852 and has now spread all over the country. By 1947, the disease was costing the United States $2.5 to 3.0 million annually.\n\n"}

His surname is alternatively translated \"Tiger-Claw\" and \"Ocelot-Claw\". John Pohl has dated his life as having lasted from 1063 until his death by sacrifice in 1115. Consonant with standard Mesoamerican practice, the \"Eight Deer\" component of his name refers to his day of birth within the 260-day Mesoamerican cycle, which cycles through 13 numbers and 20 various signs (\"e.g.\", animals, plants, natural phenomena).\n\nBorn on the Mixtec Calendar date from which he got his name, 8 Deer was the son of the high priest of Tilantongo \"5 Crocodile\" “Sun of Rain”. His mother was Lady \"9 Eagle\" “Cocoa-Flower”, queen of Tecamachalco. He also had two brothers, \"12 Earthquake\" “Bloody Jaguar” and \"9 Flower\" “Copalball with Arrow” who were both faithful war companions of 8 Deer.\n\nHe also had a half-sister 6 Lizard “Jade-Fan”. First the fiancee and lover of 8 Deer himself, she was finally married to 8 Deer's archenemy 11 Wind “Bloody Jaguar”, the king of the city \"Xipe's Bundle\", also known as Red and White Bundle. The lords of Xipe's Bundle had rights to the throne of Tilantongo and were therefore the most important rivals to 8 Deer's power.\n\nLord 8 Deer is remembered for his military expansion. The Codex Zouche-Nuttall counts 94 cities conquered during his reign. Almost always pictured wearing a jaguar helmet, he supported the powerful Toltec ruler of Cholula, Lord \"4 Jaguar\" “Face of the Night” in his attempts at expansionism, and was thus awarded a turquoise nose ornament, a symbol of Toltec royal authority.\n\nThe Codices also tell of his several marriages which seem to have been part of a political strategy to achieve dominance by marrying into different Mixtec royal lineages. He married \"13 Serpent\", daughter of his own stepsister and former fiancee of \"6 Lizard\".\n\nIn 1101 8 Deer finally conquered Xipe's Bundle, killed his wife's father and his stepsister's husband \"11 Wind\" and tortured and killed his brothers-in-law, except the youngest one by the name of \"4 Wind\". In 1115 \"4 Wind\" led an alliance between different Mixtec kingdoms against 8 Deer who was taken prisoner and sacrificed by \"4 Wind\", his own nephew and brother-in-law.\n\n8 Deer was the only Mixtec king ever to unite kingdoms of the three Mixtec areas: Tilantongo in the Mixteca Alta area with Teozacualco of the Mixteca Baja area and Tututepec of the coastal Mixteca area.\n\nHis reputation as a great ruler has given him a legendary status among the Mixtecs; some aspects of his life story as it is told in the pictographic codices seem to merge with myth. Furthermore, actual knowledge of his life is hindered by the lack of complete understanding of the Mixtec codices, and although the study of the codices has advanced much over the past 20 years, it is still difficult to achieve a definitive interpretation of their narrative. The narrative, as it is currently understood, is a tragic story of a man who achieves greatness but falls victim to his own hunger for power. The above biography of 8 Deer is based on the Codex's interpretation by Mixtec specialist John Pohl.\n\n"}

Of Irish and Scottish descent, he is the son of Kathleen (McSheehy) and Timothy Lennon. He graduated from Oak Park and River Forest High School in 1988.\n\nAt the age of 16, he met friend and future co-star Kerri Kenney at Theatre Camp at Northwestern University. The two later attended NYU, where they joined a comedy troupe called The New Group.\n\nWhile Lennon was a member of The New Group, the comedy troupe changed its name to The State. As they performed their material at theaters and clubs in New York City, they worked on the MTV show \"You Wrote It, You Watch It\". This led to the self-titled series \"The State\" (1993–95), which was nominated for a 1995 Cable Ace Award for Best Comedy Series.

Each of the four stories within the series were told from a different perspective, including that of the Detective, the Villain, the Brief and the Prisoner. The series was highly controversial upon its release due to its depiction of a corrupt British law enforcement and legal system.\n\nIn 2009, G.F. Newman stated that he considered \"90% of police to be corrupt at the time, and that there has been no significant change since then.\" For the series' thirtieth anniversary in April 2008, it was released on a limited edition DVD via 2|Entertain. In April 2018, BBC Four announced that the series would be rebroadcast on television for the first time to mark the series' fortieth anniversary. This statement was inaccurate, as a full repeat had previously been broadcast on BBC4 from 24 March to 14 April 2009 and it had also been repeated in March 1980. The 2018 repeats began at 10:00pm on Thursdays from 12 April 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe series was highly controversial upon its release due to its depiction of a corrupt British law enforcement and legal system. There was such an outcry regarding the series in the British press (perhaps hinting at the - alleged - historic, and continuing, close ties between press and police) that the BBC was prevented from trying to sell the series abroad.\n\nJohn Cooper, QC, writing in \"The Times\", described the series as 'Seismic', continuing to say that 'at the time [the plays] provoked calls from MPs for Newman to be arrested for sedition and the summoning of the director-general of the BBC to the Home Office to explain himself.'\n\nA review by Matteo Sedazzari in May 2018 concluded: 'it’s such a shame that the BBC seriously do not produce dramas like this anymore, thought-provoking, brutal and powerful', and \nAdam Sweeting in the Spectator described it as 'compellingly plausible'.\n\nJasper Rees wrote for the Arts Desk in May 2018 'Law and Order more than earns this 40th-anniversary trip down memory’s stinking back alley'.\n\nThe series was discussed on BBC Radio 4's programme Thinking Allowed on 23 May 2018, with the host Laurie Taylor talking to criminologist Tim Newburn and Charlotte Brunsden, Professor of Film & Television Studies at the University of Warwick, along with the author, to engage with the question of 'the extent to which... [the series] created a public and political debate which produced positive reform'.\n\nAmong the series' successors was the BBC TV series Police.\n\nIn parallel, the 'Law & Order' series of books was a trilogy of works written by Newman, first published by Sphere in 1977 and then reprinted in Sphere Paperbacks in 1978. The trilogy consists of 'A Detective's Tale', , 'A Villain's Tale', , and 'A Prisoner's Tale', . An omnibus edition including all three was published in 1984 by HarperCollins .\n"}

It is used by general aviation, military aviation and a few airline flights. In 2013 the Airport changed its name to \"Crater Lake-Klamath Regional Airport\".\n\nThe National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a \"primary commercial service\" airport since it has over 10,000 passenger boardings (enplanements) per year. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 15,856 enplanements in 2011, a decrease from 21,353 in 2010.\n\nAs Kingsley Field Air National Guard Base, the airport is the home of the Oregon Air National Guard's 173d Fighter Wing (173 FW) flying the F-15 Eagle. An Air Education and Training Command (AETC)-gained unit, the 173 FW specializes as an advanced air-to-air combat training center for Regular Air Force and Air National Guard F-15 pilots, as well as hosting joint and combined air combat exercises for all US military services and those of Canada. Kingsley Field is home to a USAF flight surgeon training school. The 173d Fighter Wing is currently under the command of Colonel Jeff Smith.\n\nIn 1928 the citizens of Klamath Falls approved the sale of $50,000 worth of bonds to build Klamath Falls Municipal Airport. It had gravel runways and one Fixed-Base Operator; in 1942 it was selected for a Naval Air Station later named NAS Klamath Falls. In 1945 the airport transferred back to civil use; the January 1952 C&GS diagram shows runway 7 (5258 ft long), 14 (7134 ft) and 18 (5164 ft).\n\nIn 1954 the airport was selected as a site for U.S. Air Force installation under a joint civil-military arrangement supporting Air Defense Command, later Aerospace Defense Command (ADC) aircraft and squadrons. In 1957 the airport was dedicated as Kingsley Field in honor of 2nd Lieutenant David R. Kingsley, USAAF, an Oregonian killed in action on June 23, 1944 after a B-17 bombing mission over the oil fields of Ploesti, Rumania. In 1976 ADC was inactivated and control of the military installation passed to Tactical Air Command (TAC). In 1978 the Department of Defense closed Kingsley Field as a regular Air Force installation, transferring all military facilities to the Air National Guard.\n\nCrater Lake - Klamath Regional Airport covers 1,166 acres (472 ha) at an elevation of 4,095 feet (1,248 m). It has two runways: 14/32 is 10,301 by 150 feet (3,140 x 46 m) asphalt and concrete; 7/25 is 5,258 by 100 feet (1,603 x 30 m) asphalt.\n\nIn 2011 the airport had 39,004 aircraft operations, average 106 per day: 43% general aviation, 41% military, 14% air taxi, and 2% airline. 170 aircraft were then based at the airport: 62% single-engine, 19% jet, 15% military, 3% multi-engine, and 1% helicopter.\n\nUntil 1959 United Airlines Douglas DC-3s and Convair 340s served Klamath Falls; later West Coast Airlines flew Fairchild F-27s to cities in Oregon and California. West Coast merged with Bonanza Air Lines and Pacific Air Lines to form Air West which changed its name to Hughes Airwest and merged into Republic Airlines. Air West and Hughes Airwest continued to serve the airport with F-27s. Hughes Airwest introduced the first jets, Douglas DC-9-10 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s; successor Republic DC-9s continued to serve the airport until 1983.\n\nIn the late 1970s - early 1980s Air Oregon Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners flew direct to Portland, Seattle and other cities. In the mid 1980s Pacific Express BAC One-Elevens flew to San Francisco via Redding, California and to Portland via Redmond. Horizon Air, a subsidiary of Alaska Airlines, flew de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8s to Portland and Seattle. WestAir (United Express) flew BAe Jetstream 31s to San Francisco while Reno Air Express (Mid Pacific Air for Reno Air) flew BAe Jetstream 31s to San Jose, California. United Express (SkyWest Airlines) pulled out of Klamath Falls in the late 1990s but resumed flights when Horizon Air quit the airport.\n\nSkyWest (United Express) Embraer EMB-120 Brasilias were the last airliners at Klamath Falls. In late 2010 SkyWest dropped one flight to Portland. Passenger count dropped in 2011, but passengers per flight increased. United Express, operated by SkyWest, terminated service to Portland and San Francisco on June 5, 2014. \n\nPenAir started Saab 340B flights from Klamath Falls to Portland on October 6, 2016. Initially, the proposed service by PenAir was on hold from 2015 due to federal Transportation Security Administration (TSA) refusal to station security personnel at the terminal. As of August 2017, this service has ended, following PenAir filing for bankruptcy.\n\nThe Airport City Fund operates the airport's civilian and military interest. Revenue mainly is from city property taxes, transient room taxes and the rental activities in the airport itself.

They all represented Eton in the Eton v Harrow annual needle match and represented Cambridge at cricket. These three brothers dominated the Cambridge cricket scene in the early 1880s.\n\nKynaston, George and CT were still at Eton when their father, Edward Studd, became a born-again Christian and they were far from pleased by his efforts to interest them in the gospel. However, all three themselves converted when a visiting preacher went to stay with the Studd family during the summer holidays of 1878 - an event that was to have a profound influence on and in all of the rest of their lives.\n\nThe three boys were the oldest sons of their father's second wife, Dora Sophia née Thomas, and were brought up at Spratton Hall, Northamptonshire, Hallaton Hall, Leicestershire, and Tedworth House, Wiltshire. The family also had a residence in Hyde Park Gardens. They excelled at cricket initially at Cheam School, then at Eton, and later at Trinity College, Cambridge, where the brothers achieved a remarkable record of each captaining the university cricket team in successive seasons from 1882 to 1884.\n\nThe very exceptional skills shown by CT gained him a place in the England team in 1882 which lost the match to Australia which originated the tradition of \"the Ashes\" between the two countries. The following winter he toured Australia with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team who recovered the trophy.\n\nTheir father Edward Studd, who had 11 children in all, was born in Bombay and made his fortune in indigo manufacture.\n\nCharles played in the original test against Australia where the Ashes were first named and was one of the last 2 batsman in.\n\nThe match was low scoring and had been affected by recent rain. Australia batted first and scored 63 - and England only managed 101 in reply. In their second innings the Australians scored 122 -on the second day, England needed only 85 to win.\n\nWhen England's last batsman went in the team needed only 10 runs to win, but the final batsman Edmund Peate scored only 2 before being bowled by Boyle. The astonished crowd fell silent, not believing that England could possibly have lost by 7 runs. When what had happened had sunk in the crowd cheered the Australians.\n\nWhen Peate returned to the Pavilion he was reprimanded by the captain WG Grace for not allowing his partner at the wicket CT Studd to get the runs. Despite Studd being was one of the best batsman in England Peate replied, \"I had no confidence in Mr Studd, sir, so thought I had better do my best.\" By now the damage was done and \"The Sporting Times\" next headlined with the following famous phrase:\n\nIN AFFECTIONATE REMEMBRANCE\nOF ENGLISH CRICKET\nWHICH DIED AT THE OVAL, 29th AUGUST, 1882,\nDEEPLY LAMENTED BY A LARGE CIRCLE OF\nSORROWING FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES\nR.I.P.\nN.B.-THE BODY WILL BE CREMATED AND THE\nASHES TAKEN TO AUSTRALIA.\n\nLonger lasting fame continues for the brothers in the form of the inscription on the Ashes' urn itself, which reads:\n\nFor a more detailed look at the lives of the famous three brothers, see the related articles below:\n\nThe minor brothers\n\nIn addition to the three famous brothers, there were four Studd brothers who were competent cricketers and all played for the MCC, but who did not rise to the fame of their siblings:\n\n\n\n\n\nYet another Studd\n\nA great-nephew Peter of the brothers was also a notable cricketer and also a Lord Mayor of London.\n\n"}

It was introduced in 1997, updated in 1998, and then discontinued. It was an OEM BEV variant of Chevrolet's S-10 pickup truck. The S-10 Electric was solely powered by electricity, and was marketed primarily to utility fleet customers.\n\nGeneral Motors started with a regular-cab, short-box ( bed) S-10 pickup, with a base-level trim package plus a half-tonneau cover.\nIn place of a typical inline four cylinder or V-6 internal combustion engine, the Electric S-10 EV was equipped with an three-phase, liquid-cooled AC induction motor, based on GM's EV1 electric coupe. The EV1 had a 100 kW motor; GM reduced the S-10EV's motor because of the additional weight and drag of the truck so as not to overstress the batteries.\n\nOther than the reduced motor size, most of the EV1 power electronics were carried over directly to the S-10 EV, which mandated that the Electric S-10 use a front-wheel-drive configuration, unlike the rear-wheel-drive setup of the standard S-10, and in the competing Ford Ranger EV.\n\nSimilar to the Gen 1 EV1's, there were lead acid battery and nickel–metal hydride battery options. The 1997 Chevrolet S-10 EV used a lead acid battery pack. Manufactured by Delco Electronics, the pack consisted of 27 batteries, with one being designated as an \"auxiliary\" cell. These reportedly offered 16.2 kilowatt-hours for propulsion. In 1998, an Ovonic nickel–metal hydride battery (NiMH) pack was also available; these batteries were lighter () and had a combined 29 kilowatt-hours of storage for a longer range. NiMH also has longer life but costs more than the lead acid option. The battery pack was located between the frame rails, beneath the pickup bed. On all battery types, a passive battery monitoring and management system was used; this meant that excess energy was wasted from cells with a higher charge, while the remainder of the cells reach the same state of charge.\n\nThe S-10 EV charges using the Magne Charger, produced by the General Motors subsidiary Delco Electronics. The inductive charging paddle is the model J1773 or the 'large' paddle. The small paddle can also be used with an adapter to properly seat it. The standard charger is a 220 V 30 A (6.6 kW); there is also a 110 V 15 A 'convenience' charger, and a high-power fast-charge version. The vehicle's charging port is accessed by flipping the front license plate frame downwards. The system is designed to be safe even when used in the rain.\n\nDepending on the load and driving conditions the range can vary greatly: For the 1997 model with lead-acid battery pack, city range was ; the mixed city/highway range was ; the highway range was if operating constantly at or less. The acceleration time (0 to 50 mph) was listed as 13.5 seconds (at 50 percent battery charge - the published literature stated that acceleration time was \"even less\" when the truck had a full charge).\n\nLike the EV1, the top speed of the S-10 EV was governed, albeit to , less than its coupe sibling.\n\nThe performance is much better for the 1998 model year with the nickel–metal hydride battery, at an approximately range and an acceleration time of 10.9 seconds at 50% charge.\n\n\nNote: 1998 GM S10 EV NiMh numbers above are apparently wrong. This page lists the NiMH S10 with a 29-kilowatt-hour battery and range of (EPA) which corresponds to 40.3 kWh/100 miles (403 Wh/mile). This corresponds to the NiMH version of the vehicle having a lighter battery pack than the lead-acid model.\n\n\nWhile the standard S-10 moved to a redesigned front fascia in 1998, the S-10 Electric kept the same front fascia as the '94-'97, with the exception of composite headlamps in 1998 versus the previous year's sealed-beam headlamps. The interior was also updated in 1998 along with internal combustion models, adding a passenger side airbag. Aside from this header panel, a unique lower bumper valance, and a stylized 'Electric' decal on the bottom of the doors, there is little difference externally between the appearance of an Electric and a stock S-10. Any changes, however minimal, were reported to have had a positive influence on reducing the truck's aerodynamic resistance. These changes included a closed grille and a front air skirt, belly pans beneath the front suspension, a seal between the cab and the pickup bed, and a half-length tonneau cover over the rear of the pickup bed.\n\nInternally, the instrument cluster was exclusive to the Electric S-10, and featured only four gauges - a speedometer, a large \"charge\" gauge which reads from 'E' to 'F' like a fuel gauge, a voltmeter ranging from 220 to 440 volts, and a \"power use\" meter, which acts as an ammeter of sorts showing discharge during acceleration and charge during regenerative braking. The LCD display for the shifter was shortened to display only park, neutral, reverse, and drive, since the S-10 EV does not have the usual transmission.\n\nAlthough the S-10 EV was developed from a \"base\" trim package, the Electric S-10 still came standard with dual airbags in 1998, a heat pump for both air conditioning and heating, power four-wheel ABS brakes, regenerative braking, power steering, AM/FM radio, and daytime running lamps, among other items. For colder climates, a fuel-fired heater was standard, which runs on diesel fuel from a tank. The heater will operate when ambient temperature falls below .\n\nBecause battery performance varies greatly with temperature, the heat pump supplies cooling to the batteries during charging when necessary. Passive air recirculation is used during the driving cycle to equalize variations in battery temperature. The heat pump can be activated during the driving cycle under extreme battery over-temperature conditions over , typically as a result of extreme battery discharge.\n\nUnlike the EV1, of the 492 S-10EVs assembled about 60 were \"sold\" to fleet customers, rather than just leased through restrictive programs, mostly due to the prior Department of Transportation crashworthiness evaluations done on stock S-10 pickups. As a result, a few Electric S-10s can still be found in use today. The fleet life of many of these ended in 2007 and 2008. The vehicles (around 440) that were not sold were eventually scrapped, similar to the fate of their EV1 siblings.\n\nIn 2004 GM converted an S-10 EV to rear-wheel drive, using prototype in-wheel electric motors instead of an under-hood motor.\n\n\nIdaho National Laboratory operated for the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology:\n"}

He married, firstly, Hilda Proctor-Beauchamp, daughter of Sir Thomas William Brograve Proctor-Beauchamp, 4th Bt. and Hon. Catherine Esther Waldegrave, on 10 December 1884. He married, secondly, Princess Alexandra Lieven, daughter of Prince Paul Lieven, on 18 June 1924. He died in Marylebone, London, on 14 January 1944, at age 85.\n\nChildren of Sir John Edward Kynaston Studd, 1st Bt. and Hilda Proctor-Beauchamp:\n\nSir Kynaston was the eldest but the last of the famous three Studd Brothers who captained Cambridge in consecutive seasons who also later gained high renown in his other walks of life before his death on 14 January 1944.\n\nAt Eton, Kynaston was never on the losing side in the needle matches against Harrow and Winchester. In 1879 Kynaston went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, and was four years in the XI without ever excelling in the annual University match; things moved on in 1882 when he and his brothers took an important role in defeating by six wickets the great Australian side (which later in the season beat England at Kennington Oval) by seven runs. In the match Kynaston scored 6 and 66, G B. 42 and 48, C. T. 118 and 17 not out. When Cambridge batted a second time requiring 165 runs for victory, the two elder brothers put up 106.\n\nWith the 1908 London Games being the first true Summer Olympics to feature a parade of nations, cricketer Kynaston Studd can be said to be the first person to carry the flag for Great Britain at an Olympic event. However, cricket was only played at the 1900 Olympic Games (see: Cricket at the 1900 Summer Olympics) and Studd was therefore not a competitor.\n\nWhile still at university, Kynaston was president of Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union and was involved in helping his brother Charles set up and become one of the famous Cambridge Seven missionaries to China.\n\nAfter leaving Cambridge, where he was a member of the University Pitt Club, Kynaston played occasionally for Middlesex, but spent most of his time on business and the Royal Polytechnic Institute where he was President from 1903 until his death. He was awarded the OBE in the 1919 New Year Honours (OBE).\n\nAfter serving as Sheriff of London for 1922–23, he was knighted in 1923 and became Lord Mayor of London for 1928–29. He was created Baronet at the end of his official year. \n\nWhen President of the MCC in September 1930 he gave a banquet at Merchant Taylors' Hall to the Australian team captained by W. M. Woodfull. Canon F. H. Gillingham, the old Dulwich College and Essex batsman, in his address at the Memorial Service in St. Paul's Cathedral, said that after coming down from Cambridge Kynaston realised that games were only a preparation for sterner duties, and in his presence it was easier for men to be good and harder to be bad. \"Everything he touched he lifted up.\"\n\nHis great-nephew Sir Peter Malden Studd was also Lord Mayor of London, from 1970 to 1972.\n\n\n"}

A young Japanese boy, Akira Hibiki, is alerted about the Demon Empire by a mysterious voice and rushes to the pyramid. It is soon revealed that Akira is a descendant of the ancient people of Mu who must help Raideen save the Earth. Akira enters the robot by accelerating his motorcycle to a high speed and then throws himself upward, allowing a beam from the robot to pull him into the robot's head and into an internal cockpit from where he assumes control of Raideen. Akira is aided by Mari Sakurano, who happens to be the daughter of a prominent scientist, and his friends from the soccer club.

He is an 800 meter tall demon from the Underworld that sought the power of the Star of Ra Mu and used his minions, primarily of dromes and demon robots, led by the demon brothers Gohrai and Gekido, and Baragon leading the fossil beasts and colossal monsters. If Kibango's origin in episode 24 indicates anything during these events it is that Barao had successfully kept at war with the Mu for at least two thousand years. Eventually the Mu managed to use the Star of Ra Mu to defeat Barao by imprisoning him in a statue until the events of the series and created Raideen to slay any future members of the Demon Empire that would eventually return; however, Raideen would require the control of someone half Mu and half human in order to operate to handle its power. Upon reawakening from his statue prison, Barao had lost his memories of Ra Mu, but still managed to recollect memories of his empire and those who served him. In episode 41 he begins to regain his memories due to the resurrection of Princess Lemuria (daughter of King Ra Mu and mother of Akira).\n\nFor the first half of the series his powers included instilling life into rocks to create fossil beasts and eye heat rays when he was in his statue form until episode 27.

This series was directed by Toshifumi Kawase. Five seemingly ordinary teenagers are actually superheroes called \"Raideens\" and their mission is to fight their enemy the so-called \"Super Devils.\" This series was notably different than the original, more akin to a Super Sentai series or Tekkaman Blade than the original Raideen and was designed to attract a female audience akin to \"Gundam Wing\", \"Samurai Troopers\" and \"Dagwon\".\n\nOn January 2007, a twenty-six episode series, simply titled Reideen (ライディーン; \"Raidīn\"), prduced this time by Production I.G., began transmission.

Just as Saiga is put in danger by this life-form, the bracelet that his father left him reacts to the pyramid, and the titular robot is activated. It is now up to Saiga and Reideen to defend the Earth against the mysterious invaders.\n\n\"Brave Raideen\" is considered the first super robot anime to reach a large U.S. audience directly.

Studd (2 December 1860 – 16 July 1931), was a British missionary, a contributor to \"The Fundamentals\", and a cricketer.\n\nIn 1888, he married Priscilla Stewart, and their marriage produced four daughters, and two sons (who died in infancy).\n\nAs a British Protestant Christian missionary to China he was part of the Cambridge Seven, and later was responsible for setting up the Heart of Africa Mission which became the Worldwide Evangelisation Crusade (now WEC International). As a cricketer, he played for England in the 1882 match won by Australia, which was the origins of The Ashes.\n\nA poem he wrote, \"Only One Life, 'Twill Soon Be Past\", has become famous to many who are unaware of its author.\n\nStudd's wealthy father Edward Studd became a Christian during a Moody and Sankey campaign in England, and a visiting preacher to the Studd home at Tidworth, Wiltshire, converted C.T. and his two brothers to the faith while they were students at Eton. According to his conversion narrative, the preacher asked him if he believed God's promises to give believers eternal life, and as Charles would only go so far as to profess he believed Jesus Christ died, the guest pressed the point, and Charles then believed on the Lord Jesus for salvation. Charles later recalled the moment:\n\n\"I got down on my knees and I did say 'thank you' to God. And right then and there joy and peace came into my soul. I knew then what it was to be 'born again,' and the Bible which had been so dry to me before, became everything.\"\n\nStudd continued from Eton to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1883. In 1884 after his brother George was taken seriously ill Charles was confronted by the question, \"What is all the fame and flattery worth ... when a man comes to face eternity?\" He had to admit that since his conversion six years earlier he had been in \"an unhappy backslidden state\". As a result of the experience he said, \"I know that cricket would not last, and honour would not last, and nothing in this world would last, but it was worthwhile living for the world to come.\"\n\nStudd emphasised the life of faith, believing that God would provide for a Christian's needs. His father died while he was in China, and he gave away his inheritance of £29,000, specifying £5,000 to be used for the Moody Bible Institute, £5,000 for George Müller mission work and his orphans, £5,000 for George Holland's work with England's poor in Whitechapel, and £5,000 to Commissioner Booth Tucker for the Salvation Army in India.\n\nStudd believed that God's purposes could be confirmed through providential coincidences, such as a sum of money being donated spontaneously at just the right moment. He encouraged Christians to take risks in planning missionary ventures, trusting in God to provide. His spirituality was intense, and he mostly read only the Bible. Another work that influenced him was Hannah Whitall Smith's \"The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life\". Although he believed that God sometimes healed physical illnesses through prayer and the anointing of oil, he also accepted that some ailments were chronic, and in his last years he regularly took morphine, causing some controversy. Studd also believed in plain speaking and muscular Christianity, and his call for Christians to embrace a \"Don't Care a Damn\" (DCD) attitude to worldly things caused some scandal. He believed that missionary work was urgent, and that those who were unevangelised would be condemned to hell.\n\nStudd wrote several books, including \"The Chocolate Soldier, or, Heroism: The Lost Chord of Christianity\" (1912) and \"Christ's Etceteras\" (1915). Studd's essay \"The Personal Testimony of Charles T. Studd\" became part of the historic \"The Fundamentals: A Testimony To The Truth\", R. A. Torrey and A. C. Dixon (eds) (online version).\n\nStudd continues to be best remembered by many for the poem, \"Only One Life, 'Twill Soon Be Past\". Its memorable verse states:\n\nThis poem inspired the song \"Only One Life\" written by Lanny Wolfe in 1973.\n\nStudd began as an evangelist, and among those he influenced were Wilfred Grenfell and Frederick Brotherton Meyer.\nAs a result of his brother's illness and the effect it had upon him, he decided to pursue his faith through missionary work in China and was one of the \"Cambridge Seven\" who offered themselves to Hudson Taylor for missionary service at the China Inland Mission, leaving for there in February 1885. Of his missionary work he said,While in China he married Priscilla, in a ceremony performed by a Chinese pastor, and four daughters were born. Studd believed that God had given him daughters to educate the Chinese about the value of baby girls.\n\nOn returning to England he was invited to visit America where his brother Kynaston had recently arranged meetings which had led to the formation of the Student Volunteer Movement. He also here influenced John Mott\n\nBetween 1900–1906 Studd was pastor of a church at Ootacamund in Southern India and although it was a different situation to the pioneer missionary work he had undertaken in China, his ministry was marked by numerous conversions amongst the British officials and the local community. However, on his return home Studd met a German missionary named Karl Kumm, and he became concerned about the large parts of Africa that had never been reached with the Gospel. In 1910 he went to the Sudan and was concerned by the lack of Christian faith in central Africa. Out of this concern Studd was led to set up the Heart of Africa Mission. His speaking on the subject inspired Howard Mowll (Bishop of China, and later Archbishop of Sydney), Arthur Pitts-Pitts (of the Church Missionary Society in Kenya), and Graham Brown (Anglican Bishop of Jerusalem). As an HQ for the venture, the Studds chose 17 Highland Road in Upper Norwood, South London. Like Hudson-Taylor, Studd believed that funds for the work should not be directly solicited. Finances were often tenuous. However, he enjoyed the support of Lord Radstock.\n\nAgainst medical advice, Studd first visited the Belgian Congo in 1913 in the company of Alfred Buxton, and he established four mission stations in an area then inhabited by eight different tribes. Studd returned to England when Priscilla fell ill, but when he returned to the Congo in 1916 she had recovered sufficiently to undertake the expansion of the mission into the Worldwide Evangelisation Crusade with workers in South America, Central Asia and the Middle East as well as Africa. Supported by his wife's work at home, Studd built up an extensive missionary outreach based on his centre at Ibambi in Budu territory. Priscilla made a short visit to the Congo in 1928. That was the last time they met; she died the following year. Studd was joined in his work by his daughter Pauline and son-in-law Norman Grubb, and his grandson Noel Grubb, who died on his first birthday, is buried at Nala, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Studd's daughter Edith married Buxton.\n\nIn 1931, still labouring for the Lord at Ibambi at the age of seventy, Charles Studd died from untreated gallstones, but his vision for China, India and Africa was maintained by Norman Grubb, who took charge of WEC. In total he spent some fifteen years in China and six in India on his missionary work and then he devoted the rest of his life to spreading the Gospel message in Africa, founding the Worldwide Evangelisation Crusade (now WEC International). To this day, his name remains linked with the evangelisation of the Congo Basin, and in 1930 he was made a Chevalier of the Royal Order of the Lion by the King of the Belgians. His biography, by Norman Grubb, was exceptionally popular, and some of his own writings are still in print.\n\nThe seven Cambridge students who became missionaries (known as the Cambridge Seven) to China were:\n\nStudd gained fame as a cricketer representing England's Cambridge University Gentlemen of India and Middlesex. Charles was the youngest and best known of The Studd Brothers. By the time he was sixteen he had started to excel at cricket and at nineteen was captain of his team at Eton College; after school he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was also recognised as an outstanding cricketer.\n\nStudd played in the original Test against Australia where the Ashes were first named and was one of the last two batsman in. When Studd went in, England needed a mere ten runs to win. However, an eccentric performance by his batting partner Ted Peate led to the match being lost.\n\nA week later, the relevant edition of the \"Sporting Times\" included a mock obituary which has assumed iconic status:\n\nStudd's fame lives on though through the inscription preserved on the Ashes urn to this day, which reads,\n\nStudd died in Ibambi, Belgian Congo 16 July 1931.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1976, while attending Princeton University as a junior undergraduate, he designed a nuclear weapon using publicly available books and papers. In February 1977, several months after the story first went public, Phillips was contacted by a Pakistani official trying to purchase his bomb design, an incident addressed on the Senate floor by William Proxmire and Charles Percy. Phillips was a celebrity by this time, dubbed The A-Bomb Kid by the media, and making a series of television appearances including a featured spot on the game show \"To Tell The Truth\".\n\nPhillips was an underachieving student who played the tiger mascot at Princeton games. Hoping to stay at the school, he proposed a term paper for a seminar on nuclear proliferation outlining the design for an atomic bomb similar to the Nagasaki weapon. Whether the weapon as designed would have actually exploded was questioned. Dr. Frank Chilton, a California nuclear scientist who at that time specialized in nuclear explosion engineering, said Phillips’s design was \"pretty much guaranteed to work.\" However, Phillips' faculty advisor Freeman Dyson, a renowned physicist, and professor Harold Feiveson, who held the seminar, said Phillips' design was not functional. Nevertheless, the Federal Bureau of Investigation confiscated Phillips's term paper and a mockup he had constructed in his dormitory room. In 1979, Phillips published his story together with a co-author, David Michaelis, as \"Mushroom: The True Story of the A-Bomb Kid\" ( / ).\n\nPhillips parlayed his celebrity into a brief career as an anti-nuclear activist. In 1980 and 1982 he ran for the United States House of Representatives as a Democratic Party candidate in Connecticut's 4th congressional district, losing both times to Republican Stewart McKinney.\n\nThe experience he had gained during his campaigns obtaining the voter list from the state and using it for campaign purposes led him and his brother Dean (who had written a program to handle the list on an Apple II) to found Aristotle, Inc. in 1983, a non-partisan technology consulting firm for political campaigns which John Philips has since led as the CEO. It specializes in combining voter lists with personal data from other sources (such as income, gun ownership or church attendance) and data-mining, to assist with micro-targeting of specific voter groups; as of 2007, its database contained detailed information about ca. 175 million U.S. voters and it had about 100 employees.\nAristotle has served every occupant of the White House since Ronald Reagan, and consults for several top political action committees.\n\nIn 1998 he spoke of the critical importance to a political campaign of targeting its advertising, including on the world wide web. In 2009 he observed that 8.9% of registered voters in the United States are ineligible to vote because they have moved away or died.\n\nAs of 2007, Phillips lived in San Francisco with his wife, Patricia and daughter, Katherine Grace.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2134765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2134765", "title": "WUTB", "text": "WUTB\n\nWUTB, virtual channel 24 (UHF digital channel 26), is a MyNetworkTV-affiliated television station licensed to Baltimore, Maryland, United States. Owned by Deerfield Media, it is operated under a shared services agreement (SSA) by the Hunt Valley-based Sinclair Broadcast Group, making it sister to Fox affiliate and Sinclair flagship WBFF (channel 45); Sinclair also operates CW affiliate WNUV (channel 54) under a separate local marketing agreement (LMA) with Sinclair partner company Cunningham Broadcasting. However, Sinclair effectively owns WNUV as the majority of Cunningham's stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith.\n\nThe three stations share studios and transmitter facilities on 41st Street off the Jones Falls Expressway in the Woodberry neighborhood of north Baltimore. On cable, WUTB is carried on Comcast Xfinity channel 24, and on Verizon Fios channel 9 (509 HD). In most outlying areas of the market, the station is carried on channel 10.\n\nThe channel 24 allocation in Baltimore was originally occupied by WMET-TV, which began broadcasting on March 1, 1967 as the first UHF station in Baltimore and the city's fourth. It was a low-budget and low-powered station that was sister to WOOK-TV/WFAN-TV in Washington, D.C. Both stations were owned by United Broadcasting Company (which is unrelated to the United Television that was owned by Chris-Craft Industries, which later owned channel 24). The original channel 24 was headquartered in the former Avalon Theatre on Park Heights Avenue. In 1972, both stations ceased broadcasting due to financial difficulties.\n\nFamily Broadcast Group signed on a new television station on UHF channel 24 on December 24, 1985 under the call sign WKJL-TV. The call letters stood for Where the Kingdom of Jesus Lives. The station originally maintained a religious programming format, and initially broadcast for about six hours a day with Christian-based religious shows and an hour or two of low budget westerns and movies.\n\nIn January 1986, the station quickly expanded to an 18-hour broadcast day featuring five hours of religious programming and twelve hours of family-oriented secular programs. The station began broadcasting 24 hours a day in June 1986 airing programming from the Home Shopping Network during the overnight hours. HSN announced its purchase of the station in September 1986. By November, the station aired HSN programming about 15 hours a day. It later began running HSN programming 24 hours a day and changed its call letters to WHSW on January 23, 1987. The sale to HSN was finalized on January 11, 1986.\n\nOn January 18, 1998, WNUV dropped its affiliation with UPN in favor of joining The WB. The announcement of the affiliation switch in late 1997 resulted in Chris-Craft Industries—a half-owner of UPN—buying channel 24. On January 20, 1998, the station's call letters were changed to the current WUTB. WUTB was thrown together in four weeks, allowing UPN to remain on the air in the market. Chris-Craft ran the station out of then-sister station WWOR-TV's facilities in Secaucus, New Jersey and fed the station's programming to its transmitter site in Baltimore; this included WWOR's local news coverage of the September 11 attacks. On July 25, 2001, Fox Television Stations purchased WUTB and the other Chris-Craft stations. In November 2002, rumors began surfacing that the station would become a Fox affiliate as a result of the purchase, but the network's existing Baltimore affiliate WBFF made a deal to keep its affiliation with that network.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and the Warner Bros. Entertainment unit of Time Warner announced that they would shut down The WB and UPN and merge some of their programming on a new network called The CW. Unenthused with being passed over for affiliations with The CW in several key markets outside of Baltimore in favor for stations owned by CBS Television Stations (sister company to both UPN and The CW) and Tribune Broadcasting (whose WB stations served as that network's core affiliate group through Tribune's partial ownership of The WB), Fox Television Stations' UPN affiliates immediately began pulling UPN branding and promotions from on-air use; WUTB immediately dropped its \"UPN 24\" branding and became known on-air as \"WUTB 24\".\n\nThe CW announcement again touched off speculation that Fox would pull its affiliation from WBFF and move it to WUTB. On February 22, News Corporation announced that it would start up another new broadcast television network called MyNetworkTV. This new network, which would be sister to Fox, would be operated by Fox Television Stations and News Corporation's syndication division, Twentieth Television. MyNetworkTV was created in order to give stations affiliated with UPN and The WB that were not mentioned as becoming CW affiliates another option besides becoming independent stations, as well as to compete against The CW. It was later announced that WNUV would become Baltimore's CW affiliate with WUTB joining MyNetworkTV. On August 11, WUTB adopted the standard MyNetworkTV logo and gradually rebranded itself as \"My 24\". It became a MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station when the network launched on September 5, while WNUV affiliated with The CW on September 18, 2006.\n\nOn May 15, 2012, as part of a five-year affiliation agreement extension between Fox and Sinclair Broadcast Group's 19 Fox affiliates (including company flagship WBFF) that will run through 2017, Fox included an option for Sinclair to purchase WUTB, exercisable from July 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013. In exchange, Fox received an option to buy any combination of six Sinclair-owned CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates (two of which were standalone stations affiliated with the latter service) in three of four markets: Raleigh (WLFL and WRDC), Las Vegas (KVCW and KVMY), Cincinnati (WSTR-TV) and Norfolk (WTVZ). The WUTB option would create a virtual triopoly with WBFF and CW affiliate WNUV, which Sinclair manages under a local marketing agreement with owner Cunningham Broadcasting. On November 29, 2012, Sinclair exercised its option to purchase WUTB through Deerfield Media for $2.7 million.\n\nIn January 2013, Fox announced that it would not exercise its option to buy any of the Sinclair stations included in the purchase option. On May 6, 2013, the FCC granted its approval of WUTB to Deerfield Media, which was formally consummated on June 1. Sinclair began operating WUTB under a local marketing agreement, making it a sister station to WBFF and WNUV; the sale made CBS-owned WJZ-TV the only network-owned station in the Baltimore market, and the LMA resulted in Sinclair having some form of operational control over three of the Baltimore market's six full-power commercial stations (WMAR-TV, WJZ-TV and WBAL-TV are the only remaining stations in the market not controlled by Sinclair). At some point in time after the sale closed, Sinclair moved WUTB's operations from its studios on Seton Drive in Baltimore near the city and county line, to the Woodberry facility shared by WBFF and WNUV. Following the acquisition, WUTB's branding was changed to \"MyTV Baltimore\", with its logo redesigned to match that of other Sinclair-owned MyNetworkTV affiliates that brand using their region instead of a channel number.\n\nThrough an affiliation agreement between the network and former owner Fox Television Stations, WUTB began carrying \"Bounce TV\" on 24.2 in March 2012. The network moved to WMAR-TV's third subchannel on September 15, 2014.\n\nWUTB shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 24, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 41, using PSIP to display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 24.\n\nWUTB sold its spectrum for $122 million in the 2016-2017 FCC incentive auction and the station will have to cease broadcasting on its current digital channel 90 days after it receives payment from the FCC. The station has a channel-sharing agreement with its sister station, WBFF.\n\nOn September 4, 2006, WUTB began simulcasting the weekday morning and 10 p.m. newscasts from former Washington, D.C. sister station, Fox-owned WTTG. Branded by the station as \"My 24 News\", an on-screen logo bug with the \"My 24 News\" brand was placed on the bottom left hand corner of the screen. Management at both stations cited the decision to simulcast the news programs as a by-product of cross-regional news interests and increasing overlap between the Baltimore and Washington media markets.\n\nDuring the 2006 MLB postseason, WTTG's 10 p.m. newscast aired on Washington, D.C.'s MyNetworkTV station WDCA under the name \"Fox 5 News at 10 Special Edition\", while continuing to be simulcast on WUTB. The same situation occurred in 2007, but the newscast was known as \"My 20 News at 10\". When Fox Sports or other programming delayed the 10 p.m. newscast from airing on WTTG, it was still produced for WUTB. The station dropped the morning news simulcast after the November 30, 2007 edition and the 10 p.m. simulcast was discontinued by January 2008. It cited low ratings as a reason for the removal of the simulcasts. However, many viewers who commute to the Washington area have expressed a desire to see the simulcasts restored. As a result of WUTB's sale to Deerfield Media, it remains to be seen if WBFF will produce any newscasts for WUTB or run channel 45's newscasts in the event of Fox programming overruns.\n\nOn January 8, 2016, Sinclair announced that American Sports Network would launch as a dedicated, digital multicast network under the American Sports Network name with 10 stations including WUTB on January 11, 2016.\n\n"}

It was used for general aviation and by St. George-based SkyWest Airlines on behalf of Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. SkyWest has served St. George since its founding in 1972. SkyWest, which is now one of the largest regional airlines in the world, continues to be based in St. George.\n\nThe prospect of a new airport for the region had been around for many years. The old St. George Municipal Airport, located on top of a mesa, was land-locked and had no room for expansion. The runway and terminal were too small for larger aircraft. With the rapid growth of the area and tourism increasing, a new airport became essential.\n\nThe new St. George Regional Airport () was built about 6 miles southeast of downtown at the site of an abandoned airfield, which had not seen air traffic since 1961 and most recently has been used for vehicle drag racing and radio controlled aircraft.\n\nAn Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was completed in August 2006. The study concluded the impact on the environment and noise pollution would be minimal. Plans for the new airport include a single runway usable by regional jets and larger airliners. It is initially 9,300 by 150 feet, with plans for the runway to be extended to 11,500 ft. The new airport also includes an air traffic control tower and a precision instrument approach, which the old airport did not have.\n\nThe new airport has been partially funded by grants from the Federal Aviation Administration totaling US$24.2 million. The project was expected to cost between $170 million and $190 million. The city broke ground on the new site in October 2008, and the new airport opened on January 13, 2011.\n\nThe facility included a terminal. It had one asphalt runway, 16/34, 6,606 feet (2,014 m) long.\n\nIn the year ending November 30, 2008 the airport had 62,210 aircraft operations, average 170 per day: 72% general aviation, 15% air taxi, 13 scheduled commercial, and <1% military. 177 aircraft were then based at this airport: 85% single-engine, 7% multi-engine, 2% jet, 4% helicopter, 1% glider and 1% ultralight.\n\nOn January 13, 2011, all airline flights moved to the new St. George Municipal Airport, which has since been renamed St. George Regional Airport.\n\nThe old airport was served by SkyWest Airlines (Delta Connection) flights to Salt Lake City and United Express flights to Los Angeles on Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners or Embraer EMB 120 Brasilias. From 1958 to 1960 Bonanza Air Lines Douglas DC-3s flew to Salt Lake City via Cedar City and Provo, and to Phoenix, Arizona via Prescott. After 1960 Bonanza F-27s only stopped at Cedar City; on June 19, 1972 SkyWest started flying St. George to Salt Lake City via Cedar City.\n\n"}

He played in four Tests with the English cricket team, and played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and Middlesex County Cricket Club.\n\nStudd was born near at Netheravon House, near Amesbury, Wiltshire, England. He won his cricket Colours for Eton in 1877 when he scored 32 and 23 against Harrow and 54 against Winchester.

{"id": "2134777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2134777", "title": "Teppe Hasanlu", "text": "Teppe Hasanlu\n\nTeppe Hasanlu or Tappeh Hassanlu () is an archeological site of an ancient city located in northwest Iran (in the province of West Azerbaijan), a short distance south of Lake Urmia. The nature of its destruction at the end of the 9th century BC essentially froze one layer of the city in time, providing researchers with extremely well preserved buildings, artifacts, and skeletal remains from the victims and enemy combatants of the attack. \nIn Persian, \"teppe\" means \"tell, hill\".\n\nHasanlu Tepe is the largest site in the Gadar River valley and dominates the small plain known as Solduz. The site consists of a 25-m-high central \"citadel\" mound, with massive fortifications and paved streets, surrounded by a low outer town, 8 m above the surrounding plain. The entire site, once much larger but reduced in size by local agricultural and building activities, now measures about 600 m across, with the citadel having a diameter of about 200 m.\n\nThe site was inhabited fairly continuously from the 6th millennium BC to the 3rd century AD. It is famous for the Golden bowl of Hasanlu and the Hasanlu Lovers, which were identified as two males, found by a team from the University of Pennsylvania led by Robert Dyson. The site is also known for a 3000-year old cemetery that some researchers suggest could include the burial of transgender people. Since June 2018, the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization has pushed for the entire archeological site to be declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nAfter some licensed commercial digging by dealers, the site was first dug by Aurel Stein in 1936. The site of Hasanlu was then excavated in 10 seasons between 1956 and 1974 by a team from the University Museum, University of Pennsylvania and the Metropolitan Museum. The project was directed by Robert H. Dyson, Jr. and is considered today to have been an important training ground for a generation of highly successful Near Eastern archaeologists.\n\nOriginally, excavations in the Ushnu-Solduz Valley were intended to explore a series of stratified occupation levels in the area with the objective of reconstructing a regional cultural history from Neolithic times until Alexander the Great's conquest of Persia beginning in 334 BC, such that any conclusions would rely solely on material evidence from the region itself, independent of linguistic or literary evidence from adjoining regions. The unexpected discovery of the famous \"Gold Bowl\" at Hasanlu in 1958 led to the project shifting its focus to the Iron Age levels at this site, although several other sites in the region were also excavated in order to stay in line with the project's broader objective. These other excavations were conducted at Dinkha Tepe, Dalma Tepe, Hajji Firuz Tepe, Agrab Tepe, Pisdeli, and Seh Girdan.\n\nThe Hasanlu Publications Project was initiated in 2007 to produce the official monograph-length final reports on the excavation. Currently two Excavation Reports and several Special Studies volumes have been completed.\n\n is a small mound located about 5 km southwest of Ḥasanlū Tepe, near the modern village of Dalma. It is approximately 50 m in diameter. It was excavated by Charles Burney and T. Cuyler Young, Jr., in 1958-1961.\n\nLarge quantities of handmade, chaff-tempered pottery were found. This includes 'Dalma plain ware', 'Dalma impressed ware', and 'Dalma red-slipped ware', which was covered with a uniform coat of dark-red paint. There was a variety of shapes.\n\n'Dalma painted ware' is decorated with large patterns of triangles in deep shades on red.\n\nConical clay spindle whorls were also found.\n\nDalma pottery represents Period IX at Ḥasanlū Tepe, and is dated to around 5000-4500 BCE. Links with Level XVI at Tepe Gawra have been identified, which, in northern Iraq, represents Ubaid 3 period.\n\nSimilar pottery has been found at Seh Gābī and Godin Tepe, attributed to Period X.\n\nKul Tepe Jolfa is another related site from the same period. It is located north of Lake Urmia.\n\nThe excavators originally divided the site’s occupation history into ten periods based on the nature of material finds in the different strata: the oldest, period X, stretches back to the Neolithic period, after which there was fairly continuous occupation until the early Iron Age (ca 1250-330 BC), followed by a hiatus before subsequent reoccupation; occupation finally ends in Iran’s medieval period (Hasanlu period I).\n\nStarting in the Middle Bronze III period or Hasanlu VIa (1600–1450 BC), there are important changes in material culture. This is best attested at the site of Dinkha Tepe, but is also present at Hasanlu. The most obvious change is the rapid abandonment of old styles of pottery, especially painted Khabur Ware, and the increased importance in producing monochrome unpainted pottery that is frequently polished or burnished. This ware is known as Monochrome Burnished Ware or, formerly, \"Grey Ware\"; however the ware occurs in a wide range of colors and thus is something of a misnomer.\n\nIn the Late Bronze Age or Hasanlu Period V, Monochrome Burnished Ware came to dominate the ceramic assemblages of the Ushnu and Solduz valleys of the southern Lake Urmia Basin. Some scholars link changes in pottery forms to cultural contact with Assyria, this being a period of expansion for the Middle Assyrian kingdom, when such kings as Adad-nirari I (1295-1264 BC), Shalmaneser I (1263-1234 BC), and Tukulti-Ninurta I (1233-1197 BC) were conducting campaigns into the Zagros mountains to the south. During this time, there was occupation on the High Mound and Low Mound of Hasanlu, and graves have been excavated at Dinkha Tepe and Hasanlu.\n\nAt around 1250 BC, there are some changes in the material culture at Hasanlu and in the graves excavated at Dinkha. This marks the beginning of the Iron I period, formerly identified with Hasanlu Period V but now the equivalent of Hasanlu IVc. While this period is designated the Iron I, there is virtually no iron in use during this period — two iron finger rings are known from Hasanlu. The High Mound of Hasanlu was almost certainly fortified during this period, and an internal gateway, large residential structures, and possibly a temple were located in this citadel. The Low Mound was also occupied. The best evidence of this coming from a house excavated in 1957 and 1959 dubbed the \"Artisan's House\". This structure derives its name from the fact that evidence for metalworking, primarily the casting of copper/bronze objects, was found there.\n\nAt the end of Hasanlu IVc/Iron I, Hasanlu was destroyed by a fire. Evidence of this destruction was discovered on the High and Low Mound. This destruction dates to around 800 BC and it marks the beginning of the Iron II period. While the destruction was extensive, the settlement's occupants seem to have rebuilt the citadel and the buildings of the Lower Town rapidly, cutting down the mudbrick walls of the burned structures to their stone footings and erecting new brick walls. The buildings of the Iron II settlement were based on their Iron I precursors, but were also larger and more elaborate in their layout and ornamentation. The primary example of this being the monumental columned halls of the citadel.\n\nThe continued presence in significant quantities of Assyrian goods or copies, alongside objects of local manufacture, attest to continued cultural contact with Assyria at this time; iron first appears in bulk at Hansanlu at around the same time Assyria seized control of the metal trade in Asia Minor.\nWhile the Neo-Assyrian Empire was beginning a period of renewed power and influence in the 9th century, it is also at this time that the existence of the kingdom of Urartu, centered around Lake Van, is first attested in the Neo-Assyrian annals and related literature. By the time we hear about it, it is already a fully developed state - the circumstances attending its rise in the 2nd millennium are obscure. Urartu’s expansion during this period brought the area south of Lake Urmia under its influence, although material finds at Hasanlu suggest that the city may have remained independent. Nevertheless, Hansanlu was catastrophically destroyed,\n\nWe know a great deal about Iron II/Hasanlu IVb because of the violent sacking and burning at around 800 BC, probably by the Urartians.\nOver 150 human victims were found where they had been slain. Some victims were mutilated and distributions of other bodies and the wounds they received suggest mass executions. Amid the burned remains of the settlement the excavators found thousands of objects in situ. Hasanlu IVb is a veritable Pompeii of the early Iron Age Near East. Some have suggested that the Iron II culture of Hasanlu, which has close ties to Mesopotamia and northern Syria, indicates the settlement came under the control of a foreign power, or experienced an influx of new occupants, or perhaps made internal changes to its political system.\n\nThe Iron II settlement was fortified and was perhaps entered via a fortified road system located on the southwest side of the High Mound, although this interpretation of the archaeological remains of this area has come under increasing scrutiny in more recent analyses. Two areas of the citadel were investigated by the Hasanlu Project. In the west, buildings that served to control access into the citadel, a possible arsenal (Burned Building VII), and a large residential structure (Burned Building III) were investigated. South of this was Burned Building (BB) I and BB I East. These buildings formed a fortified gateway into the Lower Court area. BBI was also an elite residence. It was in this building in 1958 that the famous Gold Bowl of Hasanlu was discovered. The buildings of the Lower Court (BBII, BBIV, BBBIV East, and BBV) were arranged around a stone-paved court. Burned Building II likely served as a temple, and it was in this building that the excavators found over 70 massacred women and children — only a few adult males were found among the victims.\n\nFollowing Hasanlu's destruction, the High Mound was used as the site for a Urartian fortress. A fortification wall with towers at regular intervals was constructed around the edges of the High Mound. Hasanlu was occupied fairly continuously during Period IIIa (the Achaemenid Period) and Period II (the Seleuco-Parthian Period).\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2134778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2134778", "title": "Cordyline fruticosa", "text": "Cordyline fruticosa\n\nCordyline fruticosa is an evergreen flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. The plant is of great cultural importance to the traditional animistic religions of Austronesian and Papuan peoples of the Pacific Islands, New Zealand, Island Southeast Asia, and Papua New Guinea. It is also cultivated for food, traditional medicine, and as an ornamental for its variously colored leaves. It is identified by a wide variety of common names, including ti plant, palm lily, cabbage palm, and good luck plant.\n\nThe reconstructed Proto-Malayo-Polynesian word for ti is \"*siRi\". Cognates include Malagasy \"síly\"; Palauan \"sis\"; Ere and Kuruti \"siy\"; Araki \"jihi\"; Arosi \"diri\"; Chuukese \"tii-n\"; Wuvulu \"si\" or \"ti\"; Tongan \"sī\"; Samoan, Tahitian, and Māori \"tī\"; and Hawaiian \"kī\". The names in some languages have also been applied to the garden crotons (\"Codiaeum variegatum\"), which similarly have red or yellow leaves. The cognates of Proto-Western-Malayo-Polynesian \"*sabaqaŋ\", similarly, have been applied to both garden crotons and ti plants.\n\nIn the Philippines, they are also known by names derived from the Proto-Austronesian \"*kilala\", \"to know\", due to its use in divination rituals. Cognates derived from that usage include Tagalog \"sagilala\"; and Visayan and Bikol \"kilála\" or \"kilaa\", though in Central Visayas, this plant is called \n\"Ti-as\". In New Zealand, the terms for ti were also transferred to the native and closely related cabbage tree (\"Cordyline australis\"), as \"tī kōuka\".\n\n\"Cordyline fruticosa\" was formerly listed as part of the families Agavaceae and Laxmanniaceae (now both subfamilies of the Asparagaceae in the APG III system).\n\nTi is a palm-like plant growing up to tall with an attractive fan-like and spirally arranged cluster of broadly elongated leaves at the tip of the slender trunk. It has numerous color variations, ranging from plants with red leaves to green and variegated forms. It is a woody plant with leaves (rarely ) long and wide at the top of a woody stem. It produces long panicles of small scented yellowish to red flowers that mature into red berries.\n\nIts original native distribution is unknown, but it is believed to be native to the region from Bangladesh, to Mainland Southeast Asia, South China, Taiwan, Island Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and Northern Australia. It has the highest morphological diversity in New Guinea and is believed to have been extensively cultivated there. \n\nIt was carried throughout Oceania by Austronesians, reaching as far as Hawaii, New Zealand (including the Kermadec Islands), and Easter Island at their furthest extent. A particularly important type of ti in eastern Polynesia is a large green-leafed cultivar grown for their enlarged edible rhizomes. Unlike the ti populations in Southeast Asia and Near Oceania, this cultivar is almost entirely sterile in the further islands of eastern Polynesia. It can be propagated only by cuttings from the stalks or the rhizomes. It is speculated that this was the result of deliberate artificial selection, probably because they produce larger and less fibrous rhizomes more suitable for use as food.\n\nTi has many uses but it is most notable as one of the most important plants related to the indigenous animist religions of Austronesians. It is very widely regarded as having mystical or spiritual powers in various Austronesian (as well as Papuan) cultures. Among a lot of ethnic groups in Austronesia it is regarded as sacred. Common features include the belief that they can hold souls and thus are useful in healing \"soul loss\" illnesses and in exorcising against malevolent spirits, their use in ritual attire and ornamentation, and their use as boundary markers. Red and green cultivars also commonly represented dualistic aspects of culture and religion and are used differently in rituals. Red ti plants commonly symbolize blood, war, and the ties between the living and the dead; while green ti plants commonly symbolize peace and healing. They are also widely used for traditional medicine, dye, and ornamentation throughout Austronesia and New Guinea. Their ritual uses in Island Southeast Asia have largely been obscured by the introduction of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity, but they still persist in certain areas or are coöpted for the rituals of the new religions.\nIn Philippine anitism, ti were commonly used by \"babaylan\" (female shamans) when conducting mediumship or healing rituals. A common belief in Filipino cultures is that the plant has the innate ability to host spirits. Among the Ifugao people of Northern Luzon, it is planted around terraces and communities to drive away evil spirits as well as mark boundaries of cultivated fields. The red leaves are believed to be attractive to spirits and is worn during important rituals as part of the headdresses and tucked into armbands. In the past, it was also worn during ceremonial dances called \"bangibang\", which was performed by both men and women for warriors who died in battle or through violent means. They are also used to decorate ritual objects. Among the Palaw'an people, it is planted in burial grounds to prevent the dead from becoming malevolent spirits.\nIn Indonesia, red ti are used similarly as in the Philippines. Among the Dayak, Sundanese, Kayan, Kenyah, Berawan, Iban and Mongondow people, red ti are used as wards against evil spirits and as boundary markers. They are also used in rituals like in healing and funerals and are very commonly planted in sacred groves and around shrines. The Dayak also extract a natural green dye from ti. During healing rituals of the Mentawai people, the life-giving spirit are enticed with songs and offerings to enter ti stems which are then reconciled with the sick person. Among the Sasak people, green ti leaves are used as part of the offerings to spirits by the \"belian\" shamans. Among the Baduy people, green ti represent the body, while red ti represent the soul. Both are used in rice planting rituals. They are also planted on burial grounds. Among the Balinese and Karo people, ti plants are planted near village or family shrines in a sacred grove. Among the Toraja people, red ti plants are used in rituals and as decorations of ritual objects. They are believed to occur in both the material and the spirit worlds (a common belief in Austronesian animism). In the spirit world, they exist as fins and tails of spirits. In the material world, they are most useful as guides used to attract the attentions of spirits. The red leaves are also symbolic of blood and thus of life and vitality. Among the Ngaju people, ti plants were symbolic of the sacred groves of ancestors. They were also important in ritual promises dedicated to high gods. They were regarded as symbolic of the masculine \"Tree of Life\", in a dichotomy against \"Ficus\" species which symbolize the feminine \"Tree of the Dead\".\nIn New Guinea, ti are commonly planted to indicate land ownership for cultivation and are also planted around ceremonial men's houses. They are also used in various rituals and are commonly associated with blood and warfare. Among the Tsembaga Maring people, they are believed to house \"red spirits\" (spirits of men who died in battle). Prior to a highly ritualized (but lethal) warfare over land ownership, they are uprooted and pigs are sacrificed to the spirits. After the hostilities, they are re-planted in the new land boundaries depending on the outcome of the fight. The men involved ritually place their souls into the plants. The ritual warfare have been suppressed by the Papua New Guinea government, but parts of the rituals still survive. Among the Ankave people, red ti is part of their creation myth, believed as having arisen from the site of the first murder. Among the Mendi and Sulka people they are made into dyes used as body paint, and their leaves are used for body adornments and purification rituals. Among the Nikgini people, the leaves have magical abilities to bring good luck and are used in divination and in decorating ritual objects. Among the Kapauku people, ti plants are regarded as magical plants and are believed to be spiritual beings themselves. Unlike other magical plants which are controlled by other spirits, ti plants had their own spirits and are powerful enough to command other spiritual beings. Red plants are used in white magic rituals, while green plants are used in black magic rituals. They are also commonly used in protection and warding rituals. Among the Baktaman people, red plants are used for initiation rites, while green plants are used for healing. The Ok-speaking peoples also regard ti plants as their collective totem.\n\nIn Island Melanesia, ti are regarded as sacred by various Austronesian-speaking peoples and are used in rituals for protection, divination, and fertility. Among the Kwaio people, red ti are associated with feuding and vengeance, while green ti are associated with ancestor spirits, markers of sacred groves, and wards against evil. The Kwaio cultivate these varieties around their communities. Among the Maenge people of New Britain, ti leaves are worn as everyday skirts by women. The color and size of leaves can vary by personal preference and fashion. New cultivars with different colors are traded regularly and strands of ti are grown near the village. Red leaves can only worn by women past puberty. Ti is also the most important plant in magic and healing rituals of the Maenge. Some ti cultivars are associated with supernatural spirits and have names and folklore around them. In Vanuatu, \"Cordyline\" leaves, known locally by the Bislama name \"nanggaria\", are worn tucked into a belt in traditional dances like Māʻuluʻulu, with different varieties having particular symbolic meanings. Cordylines are often planted outside \"nakamal\" buildings. In Fiji, red ti leaves are used as skirts for dancers and are used in rituals dedicated to the spirits of the dead. They are also planted around ceremonial buildings used for initiation rituals.\nIn Micronesia, ti leaves are buried under newly built houses in Pohnpei to ward of malign sorcery. In instances of an unknown death, shamans in Micronesia communicate with the dead spirit through ti plants, naming various causes of death until the plant trembles. There is also archaeological evidence that the rhizomes of the plants were eaten in the past in Guam prior to the Latte Period.\n\nIn Polynesia, green ti were cultivated widely for food and religious purposes. They are commonly planted around homes, in sacred places (including \"marae\" and \"heiau\"), and in grave sites. The leaves are also carried as a charm when traveling and the leaves are used in rituals that communicate with the species. Like in Southeast Asia, they are widely believed to protect against evil spirits and bad luck; as well as having the ability to host spirits of dead people, as well as nature spirits. \n\nIn ancient Hawaii the plant was thought to have great spiritual power; only \"kahuna\" (shamans) and \"alii\" (chiefs) were able to wear leaves around their necks during certain ritual activities. Ti was sacred to the god of fertility and agriculture Lono, and the goddess of the forest and the hula dance, Laka. Ti leaves were also used to make lei, and to outline borders between properties it was also planted at the corners of the home to keep evil spirits away. To this day some Hawaiians plant \"tī\" near their houses to bring good luck. The leaves are also used for lava sledding. A number of leaves are lashed together and people ride down hills on them. The leaves were also used to make items of clothing including skirts worn in dance performances. The Hawaiian hula skirt is a dense skirt with an opaque layer of at least fifty green leaves and the bottom (top of the leaves) shaved flat. The Tongan dance dress, the \"sisi\", is an apron of about 20 leaves, worn over a \"tupenu\", and decorated with some yellow or red leaves.\n\nIn Aotearoa, certain place names are derived from the use and folklore of ti, like Puketī Forest and Temuka. The ti plants in Kaingaroa are known as \"nga tī whakāwe o Kaingaroa\" (\"the phantom trees of Kaingaroa\"), based on the legend of two women who were turned into ti plants and seemingly follow people traveling through the area.\n\nThey are also widely used for traditional medicine, dye, and ornamentation throughout Austronesia and New Guinea. \n\nIn the Philippines, the roots were used to flavor the traditional \"intus\" sugarcane wines of the Lumad people of Mindanao.\n\nIn Polynesia, the leaves of the green-leafed form are used to wrap food, line earth ovens and fermentation pits of breadfruit, and their rhizomes harvested and processed into a sweet molasses-like pulp eaten like candy or used to produce a honey-like liquid used in various sweet treats. In Hawaii, the roots are also be mixed with water and fermented into an alcoholic beverage known as \"okolehao\". Fibers extracted from leaves are also used in cordage and in making bird traps. The consumption of ti as food, regarded as a sacred plant and thus was originally taboo, is believed to have been a daring innovation of Polynesian cultures as a response to famine conditions. The lifting of the taboo is believed to be tied to the development of the firewalking ritual.\n\nTi is a popular ornamental plant, with numerous cultivars available, many of them selected for green or reddish or purple foliage.\n\n\n"}

His last significant ministerial post was as the Deputy Prime Minister of India in the short lived Charan Singh government in 1979. \nHe was a strong Congress leader, co-operative leader, social activist and writer. He was popularly known as \"Leader of Common People\". He advocated social democracy in his speeches and articles and was instrumental in establishing co-operatives in Maharashtra for the betterment of the farmers.\n\nYashwantrao Chavan (Devnagari spelling ) was born in a Maratha-Kunbi family on 12 March 1913 in the village of Devrashtre in Satara District (now in Sangli District) of Maharashtra, India.He had three siblings. Chsavan lost his father in his early childhood and was brought up by his uncle and mother. His mother taught him about self-dependency and patriotism. From his childhood he was fascinated by the freedom struggle of India.\n\nChavan was an active participant in the struggle for independence of India.As a schoolboy in Karad in 1930, he was fined for his participation in the Non-cooperation Movement led by Mahatma Gandhi. In 1932, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison for hoisting the Indian flag in Satara. During this period, he came in contact with Swami Ramanand Bharti, Dhulappa Bhaurao Navale, Gaurihar (Appasaheb) Sihasane, V. S. Page and Govind Kruparam Wani.Their friendship lasted forever. \n\nAfter completing his high school education from Tilak High school Karad in 1934,he joined the Rajaram College, Kolhapur. In 1938, after obtaining his B.A. degree in history and political science (awarded by Bombay University) he joined Law College of Pune. After obtaining his law degree (LLB awarded by Bombay University) in 1941, he started practice as a criminal lawyer at Karad. In 1942, he married Venutai at Phaltan in Satara district, in a match arranged by their families. \n\nDuring his college years, Chavan was involved in many social activities and was closely associated with the Congress party and its leaders, such as Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel and Keshavrao Jedhe. In 1940, he became President of Satara District Congress. \nChavan was one of the delegates at the Bombay session of the A.I.C.C. in 1942 that gave the call for Quit India.Chavan was subsequently arrested for his participation in the movement. He spent around two years in jail, and was released only in 1944.\n\nIn 1946, Yashwantrao was first elected as Member of Legislative Assembly of the Bombay State from the South Satara constituency. In the same year he was appointed as parliamentary secretary to the Home Minister of Bombay State. In the next government of Morarji Desai he was appointed as Minister of Civil Supplies, Social Welfare and Forests. In 1953 he was a signatory to the Nagpur Pact that assured equitable development of all regions of what is now the state of Maharashtra. The 1950s witnessed the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti (United Maharashtra Movement) leading struggle for United Maharashtra with Bombay (now Mumbai) as its capital. Chavan never joined the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti (United Maharashtra Movement) and in fact called Prime minister Nehru, who opposed formation of language based state reorganization, as \"Greater than Maharashtra\". In 1957 Assembly elections Yashwantrao Chavan was elected from the Karad constituency. This time he was elected as Leader of Congress Legislative Party, and became Chief Minister of the bilingual Bombay state. The election saw the Congress party losing badly in the Marathi speaking areas to the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti. However, he was able to persuade Nehru to agree to form Maharashtra and therefore he is regarded as the chief architect in the formation of Marathi speaking state of Maharashtra. On 1 May 1960, Yashwantrao Chavan became the first Chief Minister of Maharashtra. From 1957 to 1960 he also served on the All India Congress Working Committee.\nChavan's vision for Maharashtra for the development envisaged the equal development of both the industrial and agricultural sectors across all the regions of the state. He sought to realize this vision through the co-operative movement. Legislation regarding democratic decentralized bodies and the Agricultural Land Ceiling Act were passed during his tenure as Chief Minister.\n\nAfter the resignation of Krishna Menon as Defense Minister in 1962 in the wake of India-China Border Conflict, Yashwantrao was given that portfolio by Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. He handled the delicate post-war situation firmly and took several decisions to empower the armed forces and negotiated, along with Pandit Nehru, with China to end the hostilities. He also held the Defense portfolio in the Lal Bahadur Shastri Government during the Indo-Pakistan War of September 1965.\n\nIn the by-elections in 1962, Chavan was elected unopposed as Member of Parliament from the Nashik parliamentary constituency. On 14 November 1966, he was appointed Home Minister of India by Prime minister, Indira Gandhi. \nYeshwantrao came in for criticism at the time of the first congress split in 1969. He had stuck to his earlier commitment to vote for the official Congress candidate, Sanjeeva Reddy in the presidential elections and in \ndoing so, had invited the ire of Mrs. Indira Gandhi, but later be shifted his ground and supported her. In doing so, he exposed himself to the charge of duplicity and of being a fence-sitter. According to Hatalkar, it might be said in his favour that he had nothing in common with the Syndicate faction of the Congress party but was fully in rapport with Mrs. Gandhi's views, if not her methods, that his prime anxiety was to maintain the unity of \nthe Congress, but that when he found that the split was inevitable, he did not succumb to the blandishments held out before him by some members of the Syndicate.\n\nOn 26 June 1970, she appointed him the Finance Minister of India. During his term, Indian economy went into recession for the first time since 1966 and real GDP growth fell by 0.55% in 1972.\n\nHe was appointed as the Foreign Minister on 11 October 1974. In June 1975, an Internal State of Emergency was declared in India by the Indira Gandhi Government. This period saw a severe crackdown on leaders and parties opposed to Mrs. Gandhi's rule. Yashwantrao remained in her Government during this period. In the subsequent general elections 1977, the Congress was routed with the party leader and Prime minister, Indira Gandhi herself losing her parliamentary seat. Therefore in the new Parliament, Chavan was elected the Congress Party Parliamentary leader. As Congress now the biggest opposition party, he became the Leader of opposition.\n\nThe annual session of the Congress party was held in Bengaluru at the end of 1978. On this occasion, the party suffered a split, and two separate political parties emerged, namely Congress (Indira) and Congress (Urs). While the former was led by Indira Gandhi, the latter was led by Devaraj Urs, powerful Chief Minister of Mysore. The other important leaders who joined the Congress Urs were Dev Kant Baruah, Kasu Brahmananda Reddy, Sharad Pawar, A.K. Antony, Sarat Chandra Sinha, Priyaranjan Das Munshi and Yashwantrao Chavan. On the other side, Indira Gandhi's new party included leaders like Shankar Dayal Sharma, Umashankar Dikshit, Chidambaram Subramaniam, Kamruddin Ali Ahmad, Abdul Rehman Antulay and Gulabrao Patil. \n\nYashwantrao Chavan's political career suffered a major setback following his decision to move away from Indira Gandhi. Devaraj Urs himself soon joined the Janata Party, following which the Congress(Urs) was renamed the Indian Congress (Socialist). Yeshwantrao was appointed as Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India in the short-lived cabinet of Prime Minister Charan Singh in 1979.\n\nIn the general elections of January 1980, Congress (I) won a majority in Parliament and came to power under the leadership of Indira Gandhi. In this election, Yashwantrao Chavan was the only candidate elected from Maharashtra as MP on a Congress(S) ticket. In 1981, Yashwantrao was allowed to return to the Indira-led Congress after a six month wait. Critics at that time commented that the \"Fence-sitter has come home to roost\". In 1982, he was appointed the Chairman of the 8th Finance Commission of India. He died in 1984.\n\nChaven held many important positions during a long and distinguished career. These included:\n\nYashwantrao Chavan died of a heart attack on 25 November 1984 in Delhi. He was 71. He was cremated in Karad with full state honours on 27 November and his \"Samadhi\" (resting place) is situated at Krishna-Koyna Pritisangam. \n\n\n\n\nYashwantrao Chavan took a keen interest in literature. He established the Marathi Sahitya Mandal and supported the Marathi Sahitya Sammelan(Conference). He was very closely associated with many poets, editors and several Marathi and Hindi writers. He initiated compilation of Marathi Vishwakosh (a Marathi language encyclopedia). For this, he nominated Lakshman Shastri Joshi as a chairman. He had planned to write his autobiography in three parts. The first part covers his early years in Satara district. Since his native place is situated on the banks of Krishna River he named the first volume as \"Krishna Kath\". His years as the Chief Minister of the bilingual Bombay state and later as that of the newly formed Maharashtra state were spent in Bombay and so the proposed name for the second volume was \"Sagar Tir\". Later in 1962 he was appointed Defence Minister of India by Nehru. From then he was in Delhi until his death in 1984; so he had proposed the name \"Yamuna Kath\" for his third volume. He was able to complete and publish only the first volume.\n\n"}

The breechblock is shaped like a section of a circle.\nThe breechblock is locked into place by the hammer, thus preventing the cartridge from moving backwards at the moment of firing. By cocking the hammer, the breechblock can be rotated freely to reload the weapon.\n\nDue to 19th century metallurgical techniques, as with most vintage firearms produced for black powder cartridges, rifles and pistols manufactured using this action during the 19th and early 20th centuries may not be suitable for modern, high powered ammunition. Since the early 20th century rolling block rifles in modern steels, suitable for smokeless powder cartridges, have been made for cartridges like the 7x57mm Mauser.\n\nThe Remington Rolling Block rifle is one of the most successful single shot weapons ever developed. It is a strong and simple action, very reliable, and not prone to be jammed by dirt or rough usage. It was based in part on the \"split breech\" action produced by Remington during the United States Civil War. That design was re-engineered by Joseph Rider during 1865, and the first firearm based on it, the Model 1865 Remington Pistol, was offered for sale to the United States Army and Navy in 1866. While the Army turned the design down, the Navy committed to purchase 5000 pistols.\n\nThe first rifle based on this design was introduced at the Paris Exposition in 1867, and within a year it had become the standard military rifle of several nations, including Sweden, Norway and Denmark.\n\nMany earlier percussion rifles and muskets were converted to rolling block designs in the interim before the development of more modern bolt-action designs.\n\nThe Swedish-Norwegian Remington M1867 and US Springfield Model 1871 had this action.\n\n"}

A member of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), Sanhá was President of the National People's Assembly from 1994 to 1999 and then served as acting President of Guinea-Bissau from 14 May 1999, to 17 February 2000, following the ouster of President João Bernardo Vieira. Standing as the PAIGC candidate, he placed second in the 1999–2000 presidential election as well as the 2005 presidential election before winning the June–July 2009 presidential election.\n\nSanhá was born on 5 May 1947 at Dar Salam (Darsalame) in the Quinara region, to a Muslim family.\n\nA long-time member of PAIGC, Sanhá served as governor of the Gabú and Biombo regions and held several cabinet ministries before becoming President of the National People's Assembly in 1994. A Civil War broke out in June 1998 between elements of the army loyal to General Ansumane Mane and those loyal to President João Bernardo Vieira; on 26 November 1998, Sanhá addressed the first session of the National People's Assembly since the beginning of the war. Even though he was critical of both the rebels and Vieira, he focused more of his criticism on Vieira. Following the ouster of Vieira on 7 May 1999, Sanhá was appointed as acting president by the military junta led by Mane on 11 May. His appointment to succeed Vieira was intended to be in accordance with the constitution, and he was to serve until a new election could be held later in the year. Sanhá was sworn in on 14 May with the promise of peace and an end to political persecution.\n\nIn the first round of the subsequent presidential election, held on 28 November 1999, Sanhá finished second with 23.37% of the vote. In the run-off, held on 16 January 2000, he won only 28.0% of the vote against Kumba Ialá's 72.0%. The military junta led by Mane supported his candidacy.\n\nFollowing a 2003 military coup that ousted Ialá and a period of transitional rule, a new presidential election was held on 19 June 2005, in which the three former presidents (Sanhá, Vieira and Ialá) were the main candidates. Sanhá, running again as the PAIGC candidate, finished first with 35.45% of the vote. Former head of state João Bernardo Vieira finished second with 28.87% of the vote. Despite the lead in the first round, Sanhá lost to Vieira in the run-off that took place on 24 July 2005, 47.65% to 52.35%. However, he refused to accept the result, vowing to take the matter to the Supreme Court.\n\nSanhá challenged PAIGC President Carlos Gomes Junior for the party leadership at PAIGC's Seventh Ordinary Congress in June–July 2008. Gomes was, however, re-elected at the end of the congress on 1–2 July, receiving 578 votes against 355 for Sanhá.\n\nIn the 2009 presidential election, Sanhá placed first in the first round of voting, then defeated Kumba Ialá in the second round. He was sworn in as president on 8 September. On that occasion he promised to investigate the March 2009 killings of Army Chief of Staff Batista Tagme Na Waie and President Vieira, and he also vowed to fight crime, drug trafficking, and corruption.\nSanhá was a diabetic. In early December 2009, he was due to visit Portugal, but he delayed the visit due to health problems. After fainting, he was taken to Dakar, Senegal and then Paris, France for medical treatment where he said that he was a diabetic and that he had suffered a drop in hemoglobin; even though he insisted that his diabetes was \"not as serious as people want to make out;\" he added that he intended to be more attentive about his health. Sanhá spent ten days in Paris and subsequently stayed in the Canary Islands for a time before returning to Bissau on 30 December 2009. His chief of protocol stated that he had recovered and was in good condition. Since that time he spent regular intervals in hospitals in Dakar and Paris. During his stay in Paris, a coup as a result of infighting within the armed forces was put down less than two weeks before his death.\n\nSanhá died on the morning of 9 January 2012, in Paris. His office issued a statement that read:\nThe presidency informs Guinea-Bissau and the international community, with pain and dismay, of the death of his excellency Malam Bacai Sanhá this morning at the Val de Grace in Paris where he was undergoing treatment.\n\nThe government issued a decree that it would observe seven days national mourning during which the flag will be flown at half-mast and all concerts and festivities would not occur. It also sought to repatriate Sanhá's body for burial.\n\nUnder the constitution, an election was scheduled to be held within 90 days. In the interim the President of the National People's Assembly Raimundo Pereira, from the same party, was sworn in as the acting president.\n"}

{"id": "2134827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2134827", "title": "Viewpoints", "text": "Viewpoints\n\nViewpoints is a technique of composition that acts as a medium for thinking about and acting upon movement, gesture and creative space. Originally developed in the 1970s by master theater artist and educator Mary Overlie, the Six Viewpoints has been studied and practiced for decades in theatre and dance. Overlie's practice and theory profoundly enables access to the source of inspiration and creativity. The Six Viewpoints, if practiced in the purest form, is found to be indescribably powerful and effective in all areas of investigation of, and for making art. In the simplest form it is a practice for improvisation.\n\nThe Six Viewpoints theory was adapted by directors Anne Bogart and Tina Landau, and called simply the Viewpoints. This is confusing that the two practices, which are completely different, share a similar name.*\nBogart and Overlie were on the faculty of ETW at NYU in the late 1970s and early 1980s during which time Bogart was influenced by Overlie's innovations. Overlie's Six Viewpoints (space, story, time, emotion, movement, and shape) are considered to be a logical way to examine, analyze and create art in a profound way while Bogart's Viewpoints are considered practical in creating staging with actors.\n\nSYSTEMS is a mnemonic device for the six elements of Overlie's viewpoints (the actual acronym is spelled SSTEMS: Space, Shape, Time, Emotion, Movement, and Story,) and also signifies which elements Mary Overlie considered the most important. Note the change from the classical and modern periods in performance art, where story always took precedence over the other elements. Viewpoints is part of the post-modern tradition, in that there is no hierarchy in the different elements that make \"theatre.\"\n\n\n\n\nPsychological or narrative content ascribed to movement.\n\n\n\nAll of the different elements influence each other and work together, and can \"cause\" a change in a different element. For example, the shape of your body may carry a certain emotion with it as well - something in the space of your environment may make a story out of what you are doing - etc.\n\nThe actors must focus first on the isolation of each separate viewpoint element on its own, before integrating and working them all together. It's often that a performer finds one of the elements comes naturally, and perhaps uses that one element they really understand to access the other elements, which they must work to become more familiar with.\n\nIn their book, \"The Viewpoints Book: A Practical Guide to Viewpoints and Composition\", Anne Bogart and Tina Landau identify the primary Viewpoints as those relating to Time - which are Tempo, Duration, Kinesthetic Response, and Repetition - and those relating to Space - which are Shape, Gesture, Architecture, Spatial Relationship and Topography. In addition, Bogart and Landau have added the Vocal Viewpoints which include Pitch, Volume, and Timbre. In the book, the authors outline the basics of the Viewpoints training they both espouse as well as specific methods for applying the Viewpoints to both rehearsals and production. For Bogart and Landau, the Viewpoints represent not only a physical technique but also a philosophical, spiritual, and aesthetic approach to many aspects of their work. Bogart references her work with the SITI company, and Landau with the Steppenwolf Theater Company.\n\nBogart recognizes that these are not the only Viewpoints, just the ones she finds most useful for the actors with whom she works.\n\n"}

{"id": "2134851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2134851", "title": "Andy Panda", "text": "Andy Panda\n\nAndy Panda is a funny animal cartoon character who starred in his own series of animated cartoon short subjects produced by Walter Lantz. These \"cartunes\" were released by Universal Pictures from 1939 to 1947, and United Artists from 1948 to 1949. The title character is an anthropomorphic cartoon character, a cute panda. Andy became the second star of the Walter Lantz cartoons after Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. He achieved considerable popularity until being eventually supplanted by Woody Woodpecker.\n\nWhen Oswald the Lucky Rabbit retired in 1938, following a nine-year run, Walter Lantz's studio went for months without recurring characters. It wasn't until late 1937, when Lantz had a trip to a zoo. There, the main attraction of the place was a young panda which Lantz drew pictures of. He would then use his drawings to construct a new character.\n\nAndy's first cartoon was the aptly titled \"Life Begins for Andy Panda\" in 1939. (This was obvious wordplay on the perky titles of the popular Andy Hardy movies of that era. Coincidentally, a later Andy Hardy film was actually titled \"Life Begins for Andy Hardy\".)\n\nIn the first three cartoons of the series, Andy's companion was a feisty turtle named Mr. Whippletree, while Papa Panda—Andy's father—was often the fall guy for their pranks. When the turtle disappeared from the series, Papa began to function as both companion and foil.\n\nAndy was at first a mischievous cub, whose blustery Papa is frequently trying to prove himself as a good role model. Later, Andy became a stand-alone star in the vein of Mickey Mouse, and even acquired a Pluto-like dog named Milo as a pet.\n\nThe 1940 Andy Panda short \"Knock Knock\" featured the first appearance of Lantz's most famous character, Woody Woodpecker.\n\nBy 1942, Andy Panda started wearing clothes and shoes in \"Nutty Pine Cabin\". The character was then given a major overhaul by director Shamus Culhane for the 1944 short \"The Painter and the Pointer\", with a far more malicious personality than he had ever shown previously, but this new version was disliked by both Lantz and audiences, and was not used again. Lantz continued to produce Andy Panda shorts until he closed his studio in 1949; Andy's last short was \"Scrappy Birthday\" (1949), which featured his girlfriend, Miranda Panda (voiced by Grace Stafford). When the studio reopened in 1950, the \"Andy Panda\" series never returned to production.\n\nAndy led a major part of his career in comic books, in Dell Comics' \"Crackajack Comics\" and \"New Funnies\". One early Andy Panda comic book adventure was drawn by Carl Barks (\"New Funnies\" 76, 1943). John Stanley also did Andy Panda comic book work.\n\nIn two 1943 cartoons, \"Andy Panda's Victory Garden\" and \"Meatless Tuesday\", Andy's foil was a nameless rooster. In late 1943, this rooster became Andy's comic book sidekick, Charlie Chicken: \"hatched\" in \"NF\" 79 and rapidly growing into the cartoon model. Stories about Andy's and Charlie's often-bizarre adventures ran for many years. Some were reprinted domestically as recently as the 1990s, and in Sweden as recently as 2001.\n\nAndy also appeared alongside Woody in shorts such as \"Banquet Busters\" and \"Musical Moments from Chopin\". He also had a cameo in \"The Woody Woodpecker Polka\" with Miranda Panda, Oswald Rabbit, and Charlie Chicken. In print, Andy Panda appeared in a Whitman Publishing 1943–1944 Better Little Book \"Andy Panda and Tiny Tom\" which differed from the usual Big Little Book format by having art on every page instead of art on alternate pages. Andy was scheduled to appear as a cameo in the film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" at the deleted scene \"Acme's Funeral\". \n\nThe character appears in the new \"Woody Woodpecker\" series voiced by Scott Weil. Andy also has a more mature voice with a Southern twang in this series.\n\n\n"}

In addition, many German speakers of the province wanted to renege their attachment to Italy and to once again become part of Austria and others wanted to become self-governing. Starting in 1957, small militant groups were prepared to use force to achieve their aims. The night of fire was the starting point for a series of attacks throughout the 1960s, planned and carried out by a group called South Tyrolean Liberation Committee (\"Befreiungsausschuss Südtirol (BAS)\").\n\nThe aim of the attacks was, first and foremost, to make the world aware of the South Tyrolean question.
