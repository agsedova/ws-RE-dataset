{"id": "2197206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197206", "title": "Cholsey", "text": "Cholsey\n\nCholsey is a village and civil parish south of Wallingford in South Oxfordshire. In 1974 it was transferred from Berkshire to Oxfordshire, and from Wallingford Rural District to the district of South Oxfordshire. The 2011 Census recorded Cholsey's parish population as 3,457.\n\nCholsey's parish boundaries, some long, reach from the edge of Wallingford into the Berkshire Downs. The village green is called \"The Forty\" and has a substantial and ancient walnut tree. Winterbrook was historically at the north end of the parish adjoining Wallingford and became within Wallingford parish (run by its Town Council) since 2015. Winterbrook Bridge, which carries a by-pass road across the River Thames, is in the parish.\n\nCholsey was one of the two main homes of the late author Dame Agatha Christie (the other being the village of Galmpton on the south Devon coast). John Masefield, poet laureate, lived in Cholsey.\n\nA Bronze Age site has been found beside the River Thames at Whitecross Farm in the northeast of the parish. A pre-Roman road, the Icknield Way, crosses the River Thames at Cholsey.\n\nA recent find has been a substantial Roman site in Celsea Place. Archaeologists discovered the best examples of corn dryers they have seen, with precision suggesting they were built by an engineer. Sites of burials and cremation pots have also been found. There is also part of a Roman villa, the majority of which appeared to have extended out under the existing road and houses and will have suffered significant unrecorded damage. The section of villa remaining within the archaeologically excavated area has been preserved in situ.\n\nThe village itself was founded on an island (\"Ceol's Isle\") in marshy ground close to the Thames. There is evidence that the House of Wessex royal family owned land in Cholsey in the 6th and 7th centuries. At this time the town was home to a Saint Wilgyth who was venerated locally in the Middle Ages.\n\nA royal nunnery, Cholsey Abbey, was founded in the village in AD 986 by Queen Dowager Ælfthryth on land given by her son, King Ethelred the Unready. The nunnery is thought to have been destroyed by invading Danes in 1006 when they camped in Cholsey after setting nearby Wallingford ablaze. However, Saxon masonry still survives in the Church of England parish church of St Mary. Most of this flint and stone church was built in the 12th century. The church is cruciform. Additions were made to it in the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\nIn the 13th-century a tithe barn was built in the village. It was, at the time, the largest aisled building in the world, being high, wide and over long. It was demolished in 1815.\n\nFair Mile Hospital, a former psychiatric hospital, opened near Cholsey in 1870 and closed in 2003. In 2011–14 its Victorian buildings were converted to homes and new housing was built in its grounds.\n\nWriter and poet John Masefield lived in the parish, for several years during World War I, as tenant of Lollingdon Farm, at the foot of the Berkshire Downs. He was Poet Laureate from 1936 to his death in 1967 and is most famous for a series of poems and sonnets called \"Lollingdon Downs\" and his poem \"Sea-Fever\", which has been set to music by John Ireland.\n\nThe grave of novelist Dame Agatha Christie is in the churchyard of St Mary's. She lived with her second husband, archaeologist Sir Max Mallowan, at Winterbrook House, in the north of the parish, from about 1934 and died there in 1976. She and her husband Sir Max had chosen a burial plot in the mid 1960s just under the perimeter wall of the churchyard. About 20 journalists and TV reporters attended her funeral service, some having travelled from as far away as South America. Thirty wreaths adorned her grave including one from the cast of her long-running play \"The Mousetrap\", and another sent \"on behalf of the multitude of grateful readers\" from the Ulverscroft Large Print Book Publishers.\n\nEdward Prioleau Warren (1856–1937), lived at Breach House, in Halfpenny Lane, Cholsey, built in 1906, which he designed for himself.\n\nCholsey is served by Cholsey railway station, a calling point for Great Western Railway stopping services on the Great Western Main Line between Reading and Didcot.\n\nThe station was also the junction for a branch line to , nicknamed the \"Wallingford Bunk\", which the heritage Cholsey and Wallingford Railway now operates on Bank Holidays and some weekends.\n\nFrom Mondays to Saturdays Thames Travel bus route 136 links Cholsey with Wallingford and Benson. There is no evening, Sunday or bank holiday service.\n\n\n"}

Nichols began modeling while attending Columbia University in New York City in the late 1990s, and transitioned into acting by the early 2000s; she had a part in the romantic drama \"Autumn in New York\" (2000) and a one-episode role in the fourth season of \"Sex and the City\" (2002). Her first major role was in the comedy \"\" (2003), and she went on to achieve wider recognition playing Rachel Gibson in the final season of the action television series \"Alias\" (2005–2006) and for her role in the horror film \"The Amityville Horror\" (2005).\n\nNichols obtained her first starring film role in the thriller \"P2\" (2007), and found mainstream success with the science-fiction action films \"Star Trek\" (2009) and \"\" (2009). Her other notable films include \"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2\" (2008), \"Conan the Barbarian\" (2011), \"Alex Cross\" (2012), \"Raze\" (2013), and \"Inside\" (2016). Nichols starred in the television series \"Continuum\" (2012–2015), and played notable roles in the sixth season of \"Criminal Minds\" (2010–2011), the fourth seasons of both \"Chicago Fire\" (2015–2016) and \"The Librarians\" (2017–2018), and five episodes as a Gestapo officer named Martha on \"The Man in the High Castle\".\n\nRachel Nichols was born January 8, 1980 in Augusta, Maine, to Jim, a schoolteacher, and Alison Nichols. She attended Cony High School, where she competed in the high jump. Nichols said in an interview that she was not the hot chick in high school and her mother would euphemistically refer to her as \"a late bloomer\", \"which meant that I had uncontrollable arms and legs, I had very long appendages. I took several years of very highly structured dance classes for me to be able to control myself.\"\n\nUpon graduating in 1998, she enrolled at Columbia University in New York City, aiming for a career as a Wall Street analyst. She was noticed by a modeling agent during lunch one day and was invited to work in Paris; she eventually paid her tuition with the proceeds from her modeling work. She worked on advertising campaigns for Abercrombie & Fitch, Guess, and L'Oréal; she also hosted several MTV specials. Nichols studied economics and psychology, as well as drama, graduating from Columbia in 2003 with a double major in mathematics and economics. Nichols said in September 2008 that \"the modeling shoes have been hung up.\"\n\nNichols had done commercial work and had a bit part as a model in the romantic drama film \"Autumn in New York\" (2000) when her modeling agent helped her get a one-episode role in the fourth season of \"Sex and the City\" (2002). She later said she had \"never really done a proper audition before\", and added that \"I had such fun [filming on set], that day actually made me want to pursue [acting] more seriously.\" Later that year she was cast in her first major film role as Jessica, a dogged student newspaper reporter, in \"\" (2003). Although the film was panned by critics, making it was a learning experience for Nichols. She said, \"I was a sponge for the entire time I was in Atlanta [during filming] and freely admitted that I had no idea what was going on. I had never done a big film before, I had never been the lead in a film before and any advice anyone wanted to give me, I was more than willing to take.\" The following year, Nichols played a member of a high school debate team in the independent film \"Debating Robert Lee\" (2004) and had a two-episode role in the crime drama television series \"Line of Fire\" (2004), which was cancelled after 11 of 13 produced episodes were broadcast. By August 2004, she was cast in supporting roles in the horror films \"The Amityville Horror\" (2005) and \"The Woods\" (2006).\n\nIn late February 2004, Nichols was cast in a starring role in a then-untitled drama pilot for the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox). According to \"Variety\", her character was to be \"a DEA agent who goes undercover at a high school\". Todd and Glenn Kessler were developing the series, ultimately titled \"The Inside\". The pilot they produced did not satisfy studio executives, however, and Tim Minear was brought in to create a new pilot for the series in late September 2004, replacing the Kesslers as executive producer and showrunner. \"The Inside\" was originally supposed to air midseason, but the new pilot itself was reshot and the series was pushed back. The new concept made Nichols' character a rookie FBI agent assigned to the FBI's Los Angeles Violent Crimes Unit. The series premiered in June 2005 and critical reception was mixed; it had been scheduled opposite the popular \"Dancing with the Stars\" on ABC, and due to low ratings six of the 13 produced episodes were aired. It was not picked up for further episodes.\n\nFollowing \"The Inside\", Nichols found work on the fifth season of the serial action series \"Alias\" in 2005, being cast that July. Nichols starred as Rachel Gibson, a computer expert who thought she was working for the CIA when in fact she was working for a dangerous criminal organization—a situation similar to that of the series' main character Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) in the first season. Discovering the truth, Gibson joins the real CIA and becomes Bristow's protégée. Of working on \"Alias\", Nichols said that \"to say it's the nicest set on the planet is an understatement\". Her role involved multiple fight sequences, as did Garner's. Nichols worked with Garner's personal trainer; she said she \"already knew that [Garner's] job was extremely hard. But I didn't know how difficult it was until I started training for just one fight.\" Nichols was being groomed to replace Garner as the main character due to the latter's pregnancy, which had been written into the storyline. But \"Alias\" was canceled in November 2005, making its fifth season its final. \"I think everybody knew that the show wouldn't work without Jennifer\", Nichols said, \"But still, they were grooming me, so it was heartbreaking when it happened.\"\n\nIn 2005, Nichols played a brief role in the romantic drama \"Shopgirl\" and played a more notable role as a babysitter in \"The Amityville Horror\". For the latter, she was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Scream Scene and the MTV Movie Award for Best Frightened Performance. She later revealed that she almost did not audition for the film due to her fear of dogs. \"[Producer] Michael Bay has these gigantic [dogs]. [...] And, when I went to audition for \"The Amityville Horror\", I went into his offices and literally these three huge dogs were there, and I almost turned around. I was like, 'No, I'm not going to read for this film.' I actually used the dogs in my audition to think of what would scare me the most.\" \"The Amityville Horror\" received generally negative reception from critics, but was a commercial success.\n\n\"The Woods\", which had been shelved for around 18 months, was released directly-to-DVD in October 2006, to a positive critical response. Nichols had a small part in the drama film \"Resurrecting the Champ\" (2007), playing the assistant to a sportswriter (Josh Hartnett) who believes he has found a former boxing legend (Samuel L. Jackson) living homeless on the streets. Also that year, Nichols had a bit part in the fact-based political drama \"Charlie Wilson's War\" (2007) and was cast in a new science fiction drama television series \"Them\", which was ultimately not picked up by Fox.\n\nHer first starring film role was in the 2007 horror–thriller \"P2\", as a businesswoman who becomes trapped inside a public parking garage with a deranged security guard. About the dress her character wears for much of the film, Nichols said, \"When I read the script originally, it wasn't a dress, it was a small nightgown with no bra or underwear. Then I read the first scene where she gets wet, and I went: 'OK, this has got to be altered! Nichols said in an interview that among the rules established in her contract were: \"I will not get wet and show nipples\" in addition to no nudity. A bra was sewn into the \"Marilyn Monroe dress\" she wore in the film. She said, \"I wasn't going to run around for two months without a bra, I thought that was inappropriate. But in place of the nipples there's clearly a lot of cleavage. So we made a compromise.\" \"P2\" was generally disliked by critics and flopped at the box office. Reviewer James Berardinelli said that her performance was \"admirable, although one wonders whether she was cast more for her physical assets than her acting ability.\" John Anderson of \"Variety\" wrote that \"Nichols is in territory well trod over the years by everyone from Fay Wray and Grace Kelly to Heather Langenkamp, the terrified but gutsy heroine, who in this case has been chloroformed and put into a sheer white evening dress by her abductor—who must have anticipated that his captive would try to escape in an elevator, which he could then fill with water. (Nichols' considerable physical attributes, henceforth, seem to occupy most of the screen.) She's sympathetic, hysterical when required and likeable.\"\n\nNichols had a supporting role in \"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2\" (2008), playing a jealous friend of America Ferrera's character. Overall, the film was well received by critics. Roger Ebert commented that Nichols as her character Julia \"proves a principle that should be in the Little Movie Glossary: If a short, curvy, sun-kissed heroine [Ferrera] has a tall, thin blond as a roommate, that blond is destined to be a bitch. No way around it.\" Stephen Holden, writing for \"The New York Times\", similarly said, \"It falls to Ms. Nichols to play the movie's designated blond baddie, a cold, arrogant vixen who tries to undermine [Ferrera's character's] triumphs in romance and onstage.\" Nichols was cast in \"Star Trek\" (2009) in November 2007, but due to the project's secrecy her role was initially unknown even to her; she said that month she did not even know her character's name. It was speculated that she would play Janice Rand, but she would actually play an Orion cadet at Starfleet Academy.\nNichols was cast as Shana \"Scarlett\" O'Hara in the live-action film adaptation of the \"G.I. Joe\" franchise \"\" (2009) in late 2007. She later said that she accepted director Stephen Sommers' offer for the role without having read the actual script. \"I'd heard from other people that the script was quite good. And then when I finally got to read it myself ... I really, really liked it ... I liked that there were two kick-ass female roles. And I liked the fact that it wasn't just a big action movie ... And there was comedy in it. I was genuinely really happily surprised when I read the script.\" She put on approximately of muscle for the role and trained in mixed martial arts with co-star Sienna Miller for some of the film's action sequences. Nichols was burned by a flame during the filming of a fight scene with Miller. Like \"The Amityville Horror\", \"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\" was not well received by most critics, but performed well at the box office. Richard Corliss of \"Time\" wrote that Nichols had \"an appealing manner and comely biceps\" as Scarlett O'Hara and took notice of her \"savory girl fight with Sienna Miller, as the mostly villainous Baroness.\" After \"G.I. Joe\", Nichols' next project was the horror film \"For Sale by Owner\", where she played the half of a newly wed couple buying a house with a secret past. The film only received a direct-to-DVD release.\n\nNichols starred as a police detective assigned to investigate the murder of a young boy in the small-scale crime drama \"Meskada\" (2010), which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and received a limited theatrical release in North America. In the 3-D sword and sorcery film \"Conan the Barbarian\", a reimagining of the 1982 film of the same name which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nichols starred as a master of martial arts, a priestess, and the love interest of the titular character. She performed her own stunts in the high-stakes action scenes and fight sequences, but a double was used for a sex scene with co-star Jason Momoa. Filming occurred between March and July 2010 in Bulgaria, and \"Conan\" was released on August 19, 2011. Budgeted at US$90million, the film received negative reviews, and only grossed US$48.8 worldwide. \"Boston Globe\" felt that Nichols portrayed her \"pure-blooded innocent\" character with the \"enthusiasm of a bored office receptionist\".\n\nNichols first guest starred in three episodes of CBS's \"Criminal Minds\", and was then promoted as a series regular. Her role was Ashley Seaver, an FBI cadet assigned to the BAU. The casting choice came amid uproar from the series' fanbase as she was brought in to replace exiting actresses A.J. Cook and Paget Brewster. However, as the season went on, viewers eventually gave her character a warm reception. \"It just kind of worked. It was a long process,\" she said. It was eventually announced that Nichols had been let go from the show. Nichols next starred in the independent romantic comedy \"A Bird of the Air\" (2011), where she took on the role of \"a librarian who joins a highway patrolman to uncover the mysteries behind the cryptic sayings spoken by an ancient parrot.\" She described the production as a \"quirky, edgy love story\" and felt that her part was a \"departure from some of the roles I've been offered\". The film received a limited theatrical release and a mixed critical response. \"The New York Times\" remarked that the actress \"is consistently appealing in the kind of role Zooey Deschanel has pretty much cornered\", while \"Village Voice\" found her character to be a \"grating twit\".\n\nIn \"Continuum\", a Canadian science fiction series, Nichols starred as a police officer against a group of rebels from the year 2077 who time-travel to Vancouver, BC in the year 2012. The series premiered on Showcase on May 27, 2012, and its first episode became the highest-rated single episode ever on the network. \"Continuum\" ran for four seasons until October 9, 2015, and earned Nichols a Constellation Award and two Saturn Award nominations for Best Actress on Television. Nichols starred opposite Tyler Perry in the thriller \"Alex Cross\" (2012), as the blighted colleague of a psychologist and police lieutenant. Like \"Conan\", her previous wide release, the film garnered negative reviews, and made a lackluster US$34.6million worldwide.\n\nIn the independent exploitation film \"Raze\" (2013), she appeared opposite Zoë Bell as women forced to fight against each other for the twisted entertainment of the wealthy elite. Nichols is credited as an executive producer in the film, and was drawn to the project for its female \"empowering\" message, remarking: \"Give us a challenge and we'll meet it. We're stronger than you think we are. I loved that about it. That was what drew me to it and that's what had always been promised\". \"Raze\" premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and received a limited release in NYC and Los Angeles. She next starred with Nicolas Cage in the action thriller \"Rage\" (2014), as the wife of a reformed criminal seeking his own brand of justice after their daughter gets kidnapped. The film was released for selected theaters and VOD. In 2014, she made a one-episode appearance in the Lifetime series \"Witches of East End\" and debuted in a recurring arc in USA Network's \"Rush\". The following year, she obtained a recurring role as a \"problem employee at the law firm she works at\" in the fourth season of \"Chicago Fire\".\n\nNichols starred in the science-fiction thriller \"Pandemic\" (2016), as a doctor who leads a group to find survivors of a worldwide pandemic. The film was released for selected theaters and VOD, and in its review, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" remarked that Nichols \"attempts to adopt an attitude somewhere between shell-shocked survivor and sympathetic physician, but doesn't manage to fulfill the role's potential\". In \"Inside\" (2016), a Spanish-American remake of the 2007 French horror film of the same name, Nichols took on the starring role of a pregnant woman accosted in her home by an unknown woman who intends to steal her baby. The film was released in Spain cinemas on July 28, 2017, where it made US$557,083, and in the United States on January 12, 2018. Nichols next obtained another recurring role on television; this time, that of a former librarian and guardian who has been thrust back five centuries into the past to finally move forward, in the fourth season of the TNT fantasy series \"The Librarians\"; for her four-episode performance, she received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Guest Starring Role on Television.\n\nIn 2019, Nichols had a five-episode run as a Gestapo bodyguard named Martha Stroud on the fourth season of the alternate history series \"The Man in the High Castle (TV series)\".\n\nNichols married film producer Scott Stuber on July 26, 2008, in Aspen, Colorado. Nichols allowed her hair to return to its natural blond color for the ceremony, as it had been dyed red for her consecutive roles in \"Star Trek\" and \"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\". They were working on building a home in Cabo San Lucas shortly after their honeymoon. Seven months later, in February 2009, Nichols and Stuber separated due to irreconcilable differences.\n\nOn December 30, 2013, Nichols confirmed her engagement to Michael Kershaw, a real estate developer. They married in September 2014.\n\n"}

Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 30,537 and migration within the country produced a net increase of 42,641.\n\nAs of 2005 Alabama had only 800 foreign-born residents (0.03% of the state population), of which an estimated 24,000 or 22.2% were undocumented immigrants.\n\nIn 2006 Alabama had a larger percentage of tobacco smokers than the national average, with 23% of adults smoking.\n\nThe racial makeup of the state and comparison to the prior census:\n\"Note: Births in table don't add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.\"\n\nHistorically, African Americans were brought to Alabama as slaves, in greatest numbers in the cotton-producing plantation region known as the Black Belt. This region remains predominantly African American, where many freedmen settled to work at agriculture after the Civil War. The northern part of the state, originally settled by small farmers with fewer slaves, is predominantly European American. The Port of Mobile, founded by the French and subsequently controlled by England, Spain, and the United States, has long had an ethnically diverse population. It has long served as an entry point for various groups settling in other parts of the state. Those citing \"American\" ancestry in Alabama are of overwhelmingly English extraction, however most English Americans identify simply as having American ancestry because their roots have been in North America for so long, in many cases since the early sixteen hundreds. Demographers estimate that a minimum of 20–23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly English ancestry and state that the figure is probably much higher. In the 1980 census 1,139,976 people in Alabama cited that they were of English ancestry out of a total state population of 2,824,719 making them 41% of the state at the time and the largest ethnic group. There are also many more people in Alabama of Scots-Irish origins than are self-reported. Many people in Alabama claim Irish ancestry because of the term \"Scots-Irish\", but most of the time in Alabama this term is used for those with Scottish roots, rather than Irish.\n\nThe religious affiliations of adult people in Alabama are as follows:\n\nAs of 2000, 96.7% of Alabama residents age 5 and older speak English at home and 2.2% speak Spanish. German speakers make up only 0.4% of the population, French/French Creole at 0.3%, and Chinese at 0.1%.\n\nAs of 2000, 25.3% of residents of the state were under 18, 6.7% were under 5, and 13.0% were over 65.\n\n51.7% of Alabamians are female and 48.3% are male; there is a surplus of 600,000 women in the age range of 25–44.\n\n\n"}

As the province with the largest number of ethnic minority groups, Yunnan cuisine is vastly varied, and it is difficult to make generalisations. Many Yunnan dishes are quite spicy, and mushrooms are featured prominently. Flowers, ferns, algae and insects may also be eaten. The cuisine of Yunnan is often compared to the cuisine of Southeast Asia as the province borders the region and many of the ethnic minorities or related cultural groups also have a presence in Southeast Asia.\n\nThree of the province's most famous products are the renowned Pu'er tea, which was traditionally grown in Ning'er; as well as Xuanwei ham, which is often used to flavour stewed and braised foods in Chinese cuisine and for making the stocks and broths of many Chinese soups, and \"guoqiao\" (crossing the bridge), a rice noodle soup with chicken, pig's kidney and liver, fish and pickled pork.\n\nYunnan cuisine is unique in China for its cheeses like Rubing and Rushan cheese made by the Bai people. Other influences include Mongolian influence during the Yuan dynasty (i.e. Central Asian settlement in Yunnan), and the proximity and influence of India and Tibet on Yunnan. Yunnan cuisine is gaining popularity in the west.\n\nYunnan is located in the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau, with an extended range of mountains, plains, and lakes, forming a colorful scenery and three-dimensional climate of tropical, subtropical, temperate, and cold zones. This kind of diverse physiognomy and environment are incredibly beneficial to the growth of a variety of plants and animals, so that Yunnan vegetables have extensive materials, luxurious and unique, and most of them come from nature, with the characteristics of green, nutrition, ecology, and health care. Yunnan is known as the \"fungus kingdom,\" \"plant kingdom,\" and \"animal kingdom.\" It is one of the regions with the most abundant edible wild fungus resources in China. There are more than 250 kinds of edible native fungus, among which common ones are bovine liver fungus, Qingtou fungus, chicken fir fungus, dried fungus, bamboo sun fungus, matsutake fungus and so on.\n\nYunnan that resembles spring in four seasons, the flower is not only the plant of ornamental view, and also the cate on the table. A lot of rare flowers like chrysanthemum, white azalea, rose, lily, magnolia, osmanthus all can make the famous flower dish name of excellent to the point. The precious medicinal materials produced in Yunnan, such as panax notoginseng, cordyceps sinensis, and gastrodia elata, are superior nourishing medicinal materials. Yunnan all-year-round vegetables keep green, mountain grass wild vegetables can be found everywhere. Said a local language, \"Spring for flower, Summer for fungus, Fall for fruit, Winter for wild vegetable.\" It reflects the light pure, original, fresh, and sweet, unique flavor. A variety of fish, shrimps, and frogs breed in the plateau lakes of different sizes, which makes the diet take on the characteristics of extensive materials, various species, and strong local flavor, forming a batch of folk local dishes and specialties of Yunnan that are popular with the public. Especially some specialty and special spices have a significant role in food flavors, such as Xuanwei ham, Zhaotong sauce, Qiubei chili, Lunan halogen corrosion, Qujing leek flower, with distinctive features such as high-quality spices and characteristic, brought a unique taste for Yunnan dish. It provides the necessary for the development of Yunnan cuisine and an original material basis.\n\nThe cooking technique is an essential factor in cooking dishes. Many flavor dishes are unique in cooking utensils, fire, taste, and color. Yunnan is a big province of ethnic minorities. The ancient cooking methods of 25 ethnic minorities are combining with the cooking techniques of the Han nationality, which makes the Yunnan cuisine taste and colorful. Both of the Han people's steaming, frying, sauté (with starch extract), pot-stewed, quick-boil, boiling, stewing, and the integration of minority baking, pestle, heat-contact, cure, stone cooking, salt cooking and other cooking methods, with a robust ancient charm, reflecting the life and customs of Yunnan minorities.\n\nFor example:\n\nBamboo Rice: Adding glutinous rice into bamboo to make bamboo rice with soft and glutinous fragrance.\nPineapple Rice: Pineapple purple rice made with hollowed pineapple with fragrant pineapple flavor.\nSteamed Chicken: Steamed chicken made with Jianshui purple pottery special steam cooker with original flavor.\n\n"}

{"id": "2197259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197259", "title": "Morcar", "text": "Morcar\n\nMorcar (or Morkere) () (died after 1087) was the son of Ælfgār (earl of Mercia) and brother of Ēadwine. He was the earl of Northumbria from 1065 to 1066, when he was replaced by William the Conqueror with Copsi.\n\nMorcar and his brother Ēadwine, now Earl of Mercia, assisted the Northumbrian rebels to expel Tostig Godwinson. In October 1065 the Northumbrians chose Morcar as earl at York.\nHe at once satisfied the people of the Bernicia by making over the government of the country beyond the River Tyne to Osulf of Bamburgh the eldest son of Eadwulf III of Bamburgh, the Bernician earl, whom Siward had slain in 1041. Marching southwards with the rebels, Morcar gathered into his forces the men of Nottingham, Derby, and Lincoln, members of the old Danish confederacy of towns, and met Ēadwine, who was at the head of a considerable force at Northampton. There the brothers and their rebel army considered proposals for peace offered to them by Earl Harold Godwinson. Negotiations continued at Oxford, where, the Northumbrians insisting on the recognition of Morcar, Harold yielded on the 28th, and Morcar's election was legalised.\n\nOn the death of Edward the Confessor, Morcar professedly supported Harold, but the people of his earldom were dissatisfied. Harold visited York, the seat of Morcar's government, in the spring of 1066, and overcame their disaffection by peaceful means. In the summer, Morcar joined his brother Edwin in repulsing Tostig, who was ravaging the Mercian coast. When, however, Tostig and his ally Harald Hardrada invaded Northumbria in September, Morcar evidently was not ready to meet them; and it was not until York was threatened that, having then been joined by Edwin, he went out against them with a large army. The two earls were defeated at Fulford Gate, near York, in a fierce battle, in which, according to a Norse authority, Morcar seems to have been prominent.\n\nYork was surrendered, and Harold Godwinson had to march in haste to save the north by the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Ungrateful for this deliverance, Morcar and his brother held back the forces of the north from joining Harold, in the defence of the kingdom against the Normans. After the battle of Hastings, Morcar and his brother arrived at London, sent their sister Ealdgyth, Harold's widow, to Chester, and urged the citizens to raise one or other of them to the throne.\n\nThey concurred in the election of Edgar the Ætheling, but disappointed of their hope left the city with their forces and returned to the north, believing that the Conqueror would not advance so far. \nBefore long, however, they met William of Normandy either at Berkhamstead, or more probably at Barking, after his coronation. William accepted their submission, received from them gifts and hostages, and they were reinstated. The Conqueror carried Morcar and his brother with him into Normandy in 1067, and after his return kept them at his court.\n\nIn 1068, they withdrew from the court, reached their earldoms, and rebelled against William. They were supported by a large number both of English and Welsh; the clergy, the monks, and the poor were strongly on their side, and messages were sent to every part of the kingdom to stir up resistance. Morcar's activity may perhaps be inferred from the prominent part taken in the movement by York. It seems probable, however, that Edgar was nominally the head of the rebellion, and that he was specially upheld by the Bernician district under Gospatric. Morcar and his brother were not inclined to risk too much; they advanced with their men to Warwick, and there made submission to the Conqueror, were pardoned, and again kept at court, the king treating them with an appearance of favour. On their defection, the rebellion came to nothing. In 1071, some mischief was made between them and the king, and William, it is said, was about to send them to prison, but they escaped secretly from the court.\n\nAfter wandering about for a while, keeping to wild country, they separated, and Morcar joined the insurgents in the Isle of Ely, and remained with them until the surrender of the island. \nMorcar, it is said, surrendered himself on the assurance that the king would pardon him and receive him as a loyal friend. William, however, committed him to the custody of Roger de Beaumont, who kept him closely imprisoned in Normandy.\n\nWhen the king was on his deathbed in 1087, he ordered that Morcar should be released, in common with others whom he had kept in prison in England and Normandy, on condition that they took an oath not to disturb the peace in either land. He was not long out of prison, for William Rufus took him to England, and on arriving at Winchester put him in prison there. Nothing further is known about him, and it is therefore probable that he died in prison.\n\nMorcar has been portrayed by Noel Johnson in the two-part BBC TV play \"Conquest\" (1966), part of the series \"Theatre 625\", and by Simon Rouse in the TV drama \"Blood Royal: William the Conqueror\" (1990). He is a significant character in \"Man With a Sword\" by Henry Treece, where he and Hereward the Wake are shown becoming allies and friends in spite of some past clashes. He is mentioned in \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" when the Mouse attempts to dry itself and other characters by reciting a dry example of English history.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2197281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197281", "title": "Għana (folk music)", "text": "Għana (folk music)\n\nGħana ( ) is a type of traditional Maltese folk music. \"Għana\" has two literal meanings. The first is richness, wealth and prosperity; the second is associated with singing, verse, rhyme and even \"kantaliena\", a type of singing with a slow rhythm. Għana can be broken up into formal and informal practices.\n\nA singer in this field is locally called \"Għannej\" (literally 'the singer').\n\nThroughout its history, informal għana situations frequently occurred among both men and women. The informal sessions shed light on the importance of the music in day-to-day life of the Maltese. The very origins of għana can be traced back to early peasant farmers. Ciantar (2000), in his article 'From the Bar to the Stage' puts together the writings of a number of foreign and Maltese scholars who make the claim early għana instances represents both the \"simple life of the Maltese peasant life\", and the \"intact natural environment of the island\". Ciantar argues that the roots of għana are buried deep within traditional Maltese way of life, so much so that the two become synonymous with each other. Such a description by the scholar Aquilina (1931), for instance, emphasises this link between the people and għana:\nHow lovely it is, to hear from a remote and abandoned village amidst our island's hills, during a moonlit evening, while the cricket is hidden among the tomato plants, breaking the evening's silence, a handsome and healthy young man, swarthy as our country makes him, singing his għana ceaselessly. His soul would seemingly burst open with his singing! iantar argues that these songs evoke the very roots of Maltese poetry and literature, a claim that is also supported by 'Dun' Karm Psaila, Malta's national poet. In an article on the origin of Maltese poetry, Psaila goes on to link għana to the modest recreation and aspirations of the common people.\nBoth scholars, Aquilina and Psaila, place għana in the 'intact' natural environment of the island:\n\n... one could listen to għana songs, accompanied by a guitar or an accordion, sung by men and women on sea costs and during popular feasts such as Lapsi (Ascension Day). Youths used to sing għana love-songs in the open country, or the streets, or in houses during work-time even at bars such as \"Viva iz-zejza\".\n\nGħana was a way to pass the time during hours of recreations and while completing household tasks. In particular, għana was practiced by the women singing on roof tops or in old communal wash houses, known as the għajn tal-ħasselin (\"spring of the washers\"). Wash houses were carved out of naturally forming caves around the island where water flows in a constant stream, providing a place to wash clothes. Like many other societies, men were the labourers and the women tended to the needs of the household. The women would converse with each other using rhyming song. It was a way of gossiping and passing time while they went about their household work. After washing, clothes were hung out to dry on the flat roofs typical of Maltese houses. From one roof it is easy to see – and indeed sing – across to neighbouring roofs over waist height fences. So essentially, there existed a pseudo community across the skyline of residential Malta, one in which women often took part in informal and unaccompanied għana sessions.\n\nThere are 3 main types of għana: fil-Għoli, tal-Fatt and Spirtu Pront. Għana fil-Għoli is also known as Bormliża, taking its name from the city of Bormla where it was popular. Bormliża singing requires males to reach into extraordinarily high soprano ranges without breaking into falsetto. This style mimicked the early informal għana sung by women, but due to its extreme vocal demands, this style is very seldom practised. Għana tal-Fatt literally means 'fact' or 'actually happened'. This melancholic ballad style involves one għannej recounting a story about well known local identities, events or recent interesting or humorous, Maltese folktales and legends. Spirtu pront translates as 'quick wit', and originated from the informal 'song duels'. Other types of għana are: bil-Qamsa and Makjetta\n\nIn Spirtu Pront sessions, two or more għannejja (singers) are paired together and take part in an improvised song duel that demonstrates their knowledge of a wide range of social topics as well as their command of the Maltese language. Sessions take around an hour in duration, and there may be a number of sessions that make up a whole performance. The għannejja are the living poets of the Maltese language, singing in a highly expressive, free flowing style. Their improvised melodic lines borrow heavily from Arabic influenced scales. Although improvisation is definitely an element, it is never the focus.\n\nOnce a session has commenced, għannejja must participate for the entire duration, and no new singer can join. The ghannejja usually begin with an introductory comment about who is taking part in the session. This section acts as a way of easing into the bout, but has more recently been used as a way of identifying participants during taped performances. The għannejja then begin discussing the topic. This would either be predetermined, or it will be established during the course of a session, just as a conversation would. Għana is not used to settle personal differences or arguments between singers. The song subjects themes themselves are dramatic and grave, even if dealt with wittily. They may be personal honour, reflections on social values, or political (in the narrow sense of the word) (Fsadni, 1993). Singers must display their superior knowledge in the topic, while adhering to a number of formal constraints. For instance, their improvised responses must rhyme, phrases should be in an 8, 7, 8, 7 syllabic structure, and singers must use 'high-flown' language. This form of language is not one that is used in ordinary social intercourse. It is highly elaborate making use of wit and double-entendre, and drawing on the many Maltese proverbs and idiomatic phrases. The Maltese language is a very ancient language, and compared to English, it does not contain many adjectives or adverbs. Instead, over the centuries, the Maltese have developed a rich and colourful library of proverbs to act as their descriptors. Occasionally, depending on the għannej, the language used is overtly self-righteous. Ultimately, this type of practice creates tension between competing għannejja. In most cases, the għannejja would be shaking hands with their opponent, similar to a sporting match, showing that what they are saying is only for entertainment and they do not mean to cause any offence.\n\nThe accompaniment is provided by three guitars usually strumming Western influenced tonic to dominant chordal progressions. This gives għana a very unusual sound, not quite Eastern, but not quite Western. In between sung verses, the next għannej (singer) is given time to prepare a respond to his opponents' remarks while the prim (first) guitar improvises melodies based on traditional għana melodies. The għana guitar is modelled on the Spanish guitar, and is described by Marcia Herndon as:\n... a standard instrument, with metal frets and turning keys, metal strings, and traditional decorations on the front. It differs from the standard guitar only in that there are two sizes. The solo guitar is slightly smaller than the accompanying instruments. This, along with the method of tuning, indicates the presence in Malta of an older tradition of guitar playing which has almost died out elsewhere in the Mediterranean. The guitars are played with or without the use of a pick.\n\nDuring spirtu pront, the \"prim\" begins improvising along a motive chosen from a 'restricted' repertory of Ghana motives. This section is known as the prejjem. These motives are popular, not only among the dilettante, but are well known outside of the għana community by the general Maltese public. The lead guitarist begins with an introductory section accompanied by the strumming of triadic, diatonic chords provided by the other guitarists. As soon as the former completes his improvisation he joins the other guitarists in the accompaniment based on the tonic and dominant of the established key. The function of this introductory section is to establish the tonality and tempo for the session. Tonality changes from one session to another in a whole performance, depending on what collectively suits the għannejja (singers). In the most frequently used 'La' accompaniment (akkumpanjament fuq il-La), the strings of the lead guitar will be tuned to e a d' g' b' e² while those of the second accompanying guitars will be tuned a minor third lower, except for the bottom string: e f# b e' g#' c#². The tone quality of these locally produced guitars is described by Ciantar (1997) as \"very compact, with very low bass resonance\". Such tuning is through to better facilitate the technical demands imposed on the lead guitarist in the creation of new motifs and variations. In the introductory section a series of rhythmic and intervallic structures are created and developed; this same rhythmic and melodic material is then reiterated in the second section by both the ghannejja and the lead guitarist. The frequent use of syncopation and descending melodic movements, for instance, form part of the formal structure of both the singing and instrumental soloing in the spirtu pront; these are structural elements announced in the introductory section as to establish the style of both Ghana singing and playing.\n\n(1907-1992)\n(1922-2012)\n\n"}

It is regarded as one of the most competitive and longest-standing rivalries in American baseball, with some observers considering it the greatest sports rivalry of all time.\n\nThe rivalry between the Dodgers and Giants began in the late 19th century when both clubs were based in New York City. The Dodgers played in the borough of Brooklyn and the Giants played at the Polo Grounds in the borough of Manhattan.\n\nAfter the season, Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley decided to move the team to Los Angeles for financial and other reasons. Along the way, he convinced Giants owner Horace Stoneham (who was considering moving his team to Minnesota) to preserve the rivalry by bringing his team to California as well. New York baseball fans were stunned and heartbroken by the move, which left New York with only one baseball team, the Yankees. However, to supplant the Giants' absence, New York was granted a second baseball team, the Mets, who inherited the colors of the rivalry—orange from the Giants and blue from the Dodgers.\n\nGiven that the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have long been competitors in the economic, cultural, and political arenas, the teams' new homes in California were fertile ground for the rivalry's transplantation. Each team's ability to endure for over a century while moving across the country, as well as the rivalry's growth from a cross-city to a cross-state engagement, have led to the rivalry being considered one of the greatest in sports history.\n\nThe Dodgers and Giants are tied for most National League Pennants, each with 23. While the Dodgers have won the National League West 17 times compared to the Giants' 8 since the beginning of the Divisional Era in 1969, the Giants have more total wins, head-to-head wins, and World Series titles (8–6) in franchise history. Since moving to California, the Dodgers hold the edge in pennants (11-6) and World Series titles (5–3). The Giants' most recent World Series appearance and championship occurred in 2014. The Dodgers last appeared in the World Series in 2018, with their most recent title coming in 1988.\n\nThe Giants currently lead the regular season series 1,256–1,233–17. The two teams have never met in the postseason.\n\nIn the 1880s, New York City played host to a number of professional baseball clubs in the National League and the American Association. By 1889, each league had only one representative in New York—the Giants in the NL and Dodgers (then known as the Bridegrooms) in the AA. The teams met in the 1889 World Series, in which the Giants defeated the Bridegrooms 6 games to 3. In 1890, the Dodgers entered the NL and the rivalry was officially underway.\n\nAlthough the two teams were geographically proximate rivals anyway, the animus between the two teams ran deeper than mere competitiveness. Giants fans were seen as well to do elitists of Manhattan while Dodgers fans tended to be more blue collar and had more Latino fans due to what was then the working class atmosphere of Brooklyn. In 1900, a year in which the Dodgers won the pennant and the Giants finished last, Giants owner Andrew Freedman attempted to have the NL split all profits equally, irrespective of the teams’ individual success or failure.\n\nIn the early 1900s, the rivalry was heightened by a long-standing personal feud (originally a business difference) between Charles Ebbets, owner of the Dodgers, and John McGraw, manager of the Giants. The two used their teams as fighting surrogates, which caused incidents between players both on and off the field, and inflamed local fans' passions sometimes to deadly levels.\n\nIn 1940, umpire George Magerkurth was brutally beaten during a game by an enraged Dodgers fan ostensibly for making a pro-Giants call. The rivalry is said to have been the motive for multiple fan-on-fan homicides, in 1938 and 2003. Future Dodgers manager Joe Torre recalled how he felt threatened being a Giants fan growing up in Brooklyn in the series.\n\nDuring the latter years for both teams in New York, players often engaged in purposeful, aggressive, physical altercations. In 1965, Giants pitcher Juan Marichal knocked Dodgers catcher John Roseboro in the head with a bat.\n\nIn , the Dodgers and Giants played their 2,500th game against each other, becoming only the third set of teams in the four major North American sports leagues to do so, joining the Pittsburgh Pirates and Chicago Cubs and the Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nOne notable characteristic of the rivalry is how both have often played meaningful games late in the year. Since 1951, the Giants and Dodgers have finished first and second 11 times. Just as important is the role one team has played as spoiler to the other in the years when they were not directly competing in a pennant race.\n\nThe New York Giants won the 68-year series against the Brooklyn Dodgers, 722–671–17. But since relocating to the West Coast in 1958, the Dodgers are ahead in the games played between the two teams, 558–532. \n\nOn July 14, 2005, the Giants became the first professional sports team to win 10,000 games with a 4–3 win over the Dodgers.\n\nTwo Dodgers benefited from controversial calls against the Giants to keep streaks alive that continue to be Major League Records. In 1968, Don Drysdale set the current record for consecutive complete game shutouts (6) with a call against Dick Dietz for not attempting to avoid a bases loaded hit by pitch. In 1988, Orel Hershiser established the current record for consecutive scoreless innings pitched (59) with the benefit of an interference call against Brett Butler for breaking up a double play.\n\nThe Dodgers' 2014 and 2016 National League West championships were both won by overcoming leads by the Giants. Los Angeles overcame a 9½ game lead by the Giants in 2014, and in 2016, despite the Dodgers missing star pitcher Clayton Kershaw for an extended amount of time, the Giants were unable to hold an eight-game lead over their rivals. In both seasons, though, the Giants won one of the Wild Card spots. During the 2010s, the Giants have won three World Series titles, while the Dodgers are waiting for their first since 1988.\n\n\nWhen not tied for first during the last few days of the season, both teams have a long and storied history of eliminating their rival from playoff contention.\n\nAll of these events and their associated quirks and symbols are relished by the fans of these two teams.\n\nThe Dodgers won the National League pennant 12 times in Brooklyn and 11 times in Los Angeles. The Giants won the National League pennant 17 times in New York and 6 times in San Francisco.\n\nWhen the teams were based in New York, the Giants won five world championships, whereas the Dodgers won one. After the move to California, the Dodgers have won five, the Giants three. In both New York and in California, all of one team's world championships preceded the other's first one in that region to date. The Giants' five world championships won in New York preceded the Dodgers' only one in Brooklyn, in . The Dodgers' five world championships won in Los Angeles preceded the Giants' first one in San Francisco, in . All six of the Dodgers' world championships are sandwiched by the Giants' final world championship in New York () and their first in San Francisco ().\n\nSince 2000, the Giants have advanced to the postseason seven times while the Dodgers have advanced eight times. In that time, the Giants appeared in four World Series, winning in 2010, 2012, 2014, and losing in 2002. The Dodgers made two World Series appearances, losing the Series in 2017 and 2018.\n\nArdent fans of each club would be likely to consider the other as their \"most hated\" rival, enjoying the other team's misfortune almost as much as their own team's success. A typical Giants fan may just as soon ask \"Did the Dodgers lose?\" as they would \"Did the Giants win?\" and vice versa. This view is supported by the consistently solid attendance figures for Giants-Dodgers games at both home fields, and increased media coverage as well. A good example of this is that during the final 3 game Dodgers-Giants series in , the Giants drew over 150,000 fans. The attendance for these 3 games represented almost of their total fans (1.7 million) \"for the entire 81 game home schedule\", and prompted at least one reporter on ESPN to wonder if the euphoria in the Bay Area following the games reflected a delusion that the Giants had won the World Series rather than simply knocking the Dodgers out. In 2009, Forbes rated the Giants-Dodgers rivalry the most intense rivalry in baseball due to its lasting competitiveness through the 20th century and both fanbases' willingness to be overcharged for Dodgers-Giants game tickets with a ticket markup of 44% for the 2008 season.\n\nDuring games in Los Angeles, Dodgers fans will chant \"Giants Suck\", \"Frisco Sucks\" when the Giants are in town and also used to chant \"Barry Sucks\", referring to former Giants outfielder Barry Bonds, often even when Bonds was not at bat or involved in a defensive play. In San Francisco, Giants fans will chant \"Beat L.A.\" and \"Dodgers Suck\". A recent expression of these feelings was the 2007 All-Star Game in San Francisco, where the three Dodgers All-Stars (catcher Russell Martin and pitchers Brad Penny and Takashi Saito) were roundly booed by partisan fans throughout the festivities. During the final rounds of the 2013 World Baseball Classic, held at San Francisco's AT&T Park, Dodgers infielder Hanley Ramírez, competing for his home country, the Dominican Republic, was consistently booed at every appearance and whenever his name was mentioned on the public-address system.\n\nThe rivalry extends to players as well. Jackie Robinson retired rather than report to the Giants after being traded to them by the Dodgers in December of . According to legend and his teammate Tommy Lasorda, he did so because he had come to hate the Giants after ten years in Dodger Blue. This notion has been challenged on the grounds that Robinson would have been 38 years old when the new season began, and simply decided to retire. Nevertheless, in a gesture that transcends this heated rivalry, Robinson's retired blue Dodgers numeral '42' hangs in the Giants' home ballpark, Oracle Park, just as it does at all other MLB ballparks in remembrance of Robinson's breaking the color barrier in Major League Baseball. Like Robinson, Willie Mays refused to sign with the Dodgers after the season, and was traded to the New York Mets, the National League successor to both the Giants and Dodgers in New York. Cy Young Award winners Tim Lincecum of the Giants and Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers have helped keep the rivalry alive in recent years, as both have been the anchors of their respective teams' postseason rotations since 2010.\n\nBoth teams play in the National League West division, and due to the unbalanced schedule, play 19 head-to-head games each year. This is comparable to the 22 games each year that they faced each other in New York and Brooklyn.\n\nIn 2014, the rivalry intensified when Dodgers outfielder Yasiel Puig flipped his bat when hitting a home run off of Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner. Since then, the two players have sparked some bench clearing incidents.\n\nAt Candlestick Park on August 22, , Juan Marichal was involved in a major altercation with John Roseboro. The Dodgers were involved in a tight pennant race late in the season, entering the game leading the Milwaukee Braves by a game and the Giants by games. \n\nMaury Wills led off the game with a bunt single off Marichal and, eventually scored a run when Ron Fairly hit a double. Marichal, a fierce competitor, viewed the bunt as a cheap way to get on base and took umbrage with Wills. When Wills came up to bat in the second inning, Marichal threw a pitch directly at Wills sending him sprawling to the ground. Willie Mays then led off the bottom of the second inning for the Giants and Dodgers' pitcher Sandy Koufax threw a pitch over Mays' head as a token form of retaliation. In the top of the third inning, Marichal threw a fastball that came close to hitting Fairly, prompting him to dive to the ground. Marichal's act angered the Dodgers sitting in the dugout and home plate umpire Shag Crawford then warned both teams that any further retaliations would not be tolerated.\n\nMarichal came to bat in the third inning expecting Koufax to take further retaliation against him but instead, he was startled when Roseboro's return throw to Koufax after the second pitch either brushed his ear or came close enough for him to feel the breeze off the ball. When Marichal confronted Roseboro about the proximity of his throw, Roseboro came out of his crouch with his fists clenched. Marichal afterwards stated that he thought Roseboro was about to attack him and raised his bat, striking Roseboro at least twice over the head with his bat, opening a two-inch gash that sent blood flowing down the catcher's face that required 14 stitches. Koufax raced in from the mound to attempt to separate them and was joined by the umpires, players and coaches from both teams. A 14-minute brawl ensued on the field before Koufax, Mays, and others restored order. Marichal was ejected from the game and afterwards, National League president Warren Giles suspended him for eight games, fined him a then-NL record US$1,750 (equivalent to $ in ), and also forbade him from traveling to Dodger Stadium for the final, crucial two-game series of the season. Roseboro filed a $110,000 damage suit against Marichal one week after the incident but, eventually settled out of court for $7,500.\n\nMarichal did not face the Dodgers again until spring training on April 3, . In his first at bat against Marichal since the incident, Roseboro hit a three-run home run. Giants General Manager Chub Feeney approached Dodgers General Manager Buzzy Bavasi to attempt to arrange a handshake between Marichal and Roseboro however, Roseboro declined the offer. Years later, Roseboro stated that he was retaliating for Marichal having thrown at Wills. He explained that Koufax would not throw at batters for fear of hurting them due to the velocity of his pitches so, he decided to take matters into his own hands. He further stated that his throwing close to Marichal's ear was, \"standard operating procedure\", as a form of retribution.\n\nDodgers fans were angry at Marichal for several years after the violent incident, and reacted unfavorably when he was signed by the Dodgers in 1975. However, by this time Roseboro had forgiven Marichal, and personally appealed to the fans to calm down. After years of bitterness, Roseboro and Marichal became close friends in the 1980s, getting together occasionally at Old-Timers games, golf tournaments, and charity events. Roseboro also personally appealed to the Baseball Writers' Association of America not to hold the incident against Marichal after it passed him over for election to the Hall of Fame two years in a row. Marichal was elected in 1983, and thanked Roseboro in his induction speech. When Roseboro died in 2002, Marichal served as an honorary pallbearer and told the gathered, \"Johnny's forgiving me was one of the best things that happened in my life. I wish I could have had John Roseboro as my catcher.\"\n\nIn the season as a member of the Dodgers, Reggie Smith was taunted by Giants fan Michael Dooley, who then threw a batting helmet at him. Smith then jumped into the stands at Candlestick Park and started punching him. He was ejected from the game, and Dooley was arrested. Five months later, Smith joined the Giants as a free agent.\n\nGiants fan Marc Antenorcruz was shot and killed by Dodgers fan Pete Marron on September 19, 2003, in the parking lot of Dodger Stadium, following a late-season Dodgers-Giants game. Marron was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to 50 years in prison. A second defendant, Manuel Hernandez, pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter and had his 15-year sentence suspended.\n\nThere has also been Opening Day violence between the two teams' fans at Dodger Stadium. In 2009, Arthur Alverez, a reputed gang member, went to the Dodgers’ home opener with a couple and another man. After the game, Alverez and the other man, a Dodgers fan, began quarreling in the stadium parking lot. Alvarez stabbed the 30-year-old victim several times in the arm, back, and torso. He was arrested in May for suspicion of attempted murder. The trial by jury, held in August 2009, acquitted Alvarez on the charge of attempted murder.\n\nOn March 31, 2011, a 42-year-old Giants fan, Bryan Stow of Santa Cruz, California, was critically injured when he was fighting with two Dodgers fans in the Dodger Stadium parking lot after the Dodgers and Giants opened the 2011 season. The suspects subsequently fled the scene in a vehicle driven by a woman. Stow sustained severe injuries to his skull and brain and was placed into a medically induced coma after the incident. An early suspect, a 31-year-old man was arrested in his East Hollywood home in May 2011 in connection with the crime. The man was never formally charged and was declared innocent in July 2011 when Louie Sanchez and Marvin Norwood, of Rialto, were arrested and charged in the crime. Lawyers for Stow say his medical care is expected to cost more than $50 million. On May 24, 2011, Stow's family filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Dodgers for $37.5 million for his lifetime care and compensation of lost earnings.\n\nOn September 27, 2011, relatives reported that Stow showed signs of improvement. Stow began an intensive therapy program in the Rehabilitation Trauma Center at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center on October 11. Doctors have told his family that he will never fully recover. On December 19, 2011, NBC aired the interview with Stow on the program \"Rock Center with Brian Williams\". On October 25, 2012, he attended Game 2 of the 2012 World Series in San Francsico.\n\nIn April 2013, Stow's insurance company stopped paying for his full-time care in a residential rehabilitation facility and he moved into his parents' home in Capitola, California. Stow returned home on June 13, 2013 for the first time since the attack two years earlier.\n\nOn February 20, 2014, Sanchez and Norwood pleaded guilty. Under the plea bargain, Sanchez was sentenced to eight years in prison for felony mayhem and Norwood received four years for felony assault. On July 9, 2014, a jury found the Dodgers organization negligent in Stow's beating. The jury awarded $18 million in damages to Stow; the Dodgers are responsible for one quarter of this total. The remaining amount is to be split between Sanchez and Norwood.\n\nOn September 25, 2013, after a Dodgers-Giants night game in San Francisco, a Dodgers fan was stabbed to death in front of his father and brother six blocks from AT&T Park. The San Francisco medical examiner's office identified the deceased man as Jonathan Denver, 24, of Fort Bragg, California.\n\nTwo people were arrested in connection with Denver's death. San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr told the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" earlier that the victim of the attack was a Dodgers fan and was wearing Dodgers gear. Michael Montgomery, 21, of Lodi was arrested on suspicion of murder. Montgomery was later released, prosecutors citing insufficient evidence to charge him. His father claimed the stabbing was done in self-defense.\n\nOn March 12, 2014, San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón said that his office could not prove that Michael Montgomery did not act in self-defense when he stabbed Denver. According to Gascón, both Denver and his brother collectively weighed about 150 pounds more than Montgomery. According to witnesses, Montgomery had a bottle in his hand for self-defense while Denver was punching him. After Denver's brother grabbed an aluminum chair and hit Montgomery on the head with it, Montgomery dropped the bottle, took out a knife, and stabbed Denver. San Francisco prosecutors ultimately declined to file charges in connection with the case.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2197297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197297", "title": "Death education", "text": "Death education\n\nDeath education is education about death that focuses on the human and emotional aspects of death. Though it may include teaching on the biological aspects of death, teaching about coping with grief is a primary focus. Death education is formally known as thanatology. Thanatology stems from the Greek word \"thanatos\", meaning death, and \"ology\" meaning a science or organized body of knowledge. A specialist in this field is referred to as a thanatologist. \nDeath education refers to the experiences and activities of death that one deals with. Death education also deals with being able to grasp the different processes of dying, talk about the main topics of attitudes and meanings toward death, and the after effects on how to learn to care for people who are affected by the death. The main focus in death education is teaching people how to cope with grief. Many people feel death education is taboo and instead of talking about death and grieving, they hide it away and never bring it up with others. With the right education about death, the less taboo it may become.\n\nHistorically death education in American society has been seen as a taboo topic, not worthy of scholarly research or for educational purposes. In the 1960s pioneering professionals like that of Herman Feifel (1959), Elisabeth Kübler-Ross (1969), and Cicely Saunders (1967) encouraged behavioral scientists, clinicians, and humanists to pay attention and to study death-related topics. This initiated the death-awareness movement and began the widespread study of death-related behavior, developing new programs of care for the dying and bereaved, as well as new research on death-related attitudes.\n\n\"Death is no enemy of life; it restores our sense of the value of living. Illness restores the sense of proportion that is lost when we take life for granted. To learn about value and proportion we need to honor illness, and ultimately to honor death.\" Death education honors death by educating about death, dying, and bereavement to enrich personal lives, inform and guide individuals in their transactions with society, prepare individuals for their public roles as citizens, help prepare and support individuals in their professional and vocational roles, and lastly to enhance the ability of individuals to communicate effectively about death-related matters.\n\nOne of the major organizations that educates people on death is Hospice. Hospice offers support for the caregiver, and Hospice also offers information on what to expect before death and what the family can expect after death. One of the major subjects that hospice addresses within death are the myths that come along with death. Hospice will also walk caretakers through the signs and symptoms to look for that signify death.\nHospice is an important type of care that helps spread and explain death education to the people. When people have a loved one that is not able to get anymore help from medication or doctors, it would be a good recommendation for them to go to hospice. They would be able to receive great support and comfort during the end of their life journey. Not only does hospice give care to the terminally ill, they also give grief suggestions to family members and close friends. \"With proper care, proper support, and love, we can share the miracle that is life\". The end of a person's life should be centered on being alive instead of being dead.\n\nStudents of a death education course need to clearly understand the complex knowledge of the subject, learn the five key areas of knowledge, and to learn the physical, psycho-social, behavioral, and cognitive aspects of death. The five key areas are: understanding the dying process, decision making for end of life, loss, grief, and bereavement, assessment and intervention, and traumatic death. Death education should be taught in perspective and one's emotional response should be proportionate to the occasion. In addition death education can be taught formally or informally. Formally planned death education is associated with learning in organized educational settings including: schools, colleges, graduate education, professional workshops, and volunteer training programs.\n\nIn her book, In Death and Dying (1969), Elisabeth Kubler-Ross proposed the five stages of the dying process. Though her work has often been referred to as the \"five stages of grief,\" the original work was based on her clinical observations of the psychosocial responses of terminally ill patients to their impending death. Much scholarly debate has surrounded the legitimacy of her five \"stages\"—denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Experienced psychosocial clinicians have largely rejected the accuracy of the model because it addresses only emotional states, sets up false expectations of the process, and have not been empirically verified as a descriptive model.\n\nThe first stage is denial and isolation. When you first hear about a loved one who has a deathly illness your first instinct is to deny the reality of the situation. This is known as a defense mechanism because we block out the words by not fully processing them and also hide from the facts.\nThe second stage is anger. Once the blocking out subsides the reality of the situation becomes overwhelming and the pain from the news emerges.\nThe third stage is bargaining. This stage you will feel more vulnerable and helpless. In order to gain control again you'll start thinking of ways that would have made it better like:\n• \"If only we had sought medical attention sooner…\"\n• \"If only we got a second opinion from another doctor…\"\n• \"If only we had tried to be a better person toward them…\"\n\nAll of these are defense lines to try and protect us from the reality of pain in a lost one.\nThe fourth stage is depression. In this stage there can be two different types of depression that you deal with. The first type of depression can be a more quiet and private feeling. The second type of depression is the kind where sadness and regret overtake your body and become the predominate factors in your life.\nThe fifth and final stage is acceptance. This stage does not always reach everyone but for the people who actually get it should consider this stage as a gift. It does not mean that you will not be sad anymore but it does mean that there is going to be some kind of peace that you are able to reach with the loved one that died.\n\nEven though people are still conservative towards the idea of death and dying, with help and the education of death, people will come to know death as a natural part of life that everyone will someday have to go through. Instead of being timid and scared of death, people will become comfortable towards the topic and be able to prepare for what will come in the future. Death education is not just for medical professionals and those dealing with the terminally ill but rather death education is beneficial to everyone for it reveals the importance of quality in living and the human search for meaning. \"Dying was what human life moved toward and therefore dying was what a human being constantly prepared for.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2197299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197299", "title": "West Baltimore station", "text": "West Baltimore station\n\nWest Baltimore is a regional rail station located in the western part of the City of Baltimore, Maryland along the Northeast Corridor and is served by MARC Penn Line trains. It is positioned on an elevated grade above and between the nearby parallel West Mulberry and West Franklin Streets (U.S. Route 40) at 400 North Smallwood Street. Three large surface lots are available for commuters. The station is not handicapped accessible, with four low-level side platforms next to the outer tracks, but MTA Maryland plans to later renovate the outdoor station with accessible platforms and entrances.\n\nThe Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (B&P), owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad, opened to Baltimore in 1873. By the early 1900s, the PRR stopped at Lafayette and Calverton (also known as Gwynns Falls) west of Baltimore, serving local residential areas. Because both the B&P and the Northern Central Railway approached Penn Station from the west, PRR through trains from Washington to Harrisburg had to operate in reverse from Baltimore to Washington. To correct this, the PRR planned to replace the two stops with a single intercity-oriented station located between them, along with a wye at the north end of the Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel to allow trains to bypass Penn Station.\n\nThe PRR opened bidding for station construction, with an estimated cost of $50,000 (), in July 1916. The Spanish Mission style station, constructed of red brick with a terra-cotta tile roof, was designed by PRR staff architect William Holmes Cookman. The station, named Edmondson, opened on May 1, 1917. Original plans called for the installation of high-level platforms and a footbridge connecting them to the station building. However, this was delayed by the nationalization of railroads during World War I, and neither the station improvements nor the wye was ultimately built.\n\nUnlike the comparable North Philadelphia station, Edmondson was not a success. It was far from the city center without a good transit connection to it, and without the wye the station did not serve Harrisburg trains. Instead of being a major intercity stop, Edmondson was mostly served by local commuter service between Washington and Baltimore. Local service continued under Penn Central from 1968 to 1976, then under Conrail until 1983, and finally as the Amtrak-operated, state-funded AMDOT service (renamed the MARC Penn Line in 1984). The station was briefly closed in March 1979 after an accident destroyed the stairway to the platform. Amtrak's \"Chesapeake\", a limited-stop commuter train between Washington and Philadelphia, began stopping at Edmondson on July 29, 1979. The \"Chesapeake\" was discontinued on October 30, 1983.\n\nEdmondson continued to be a stop on the state-funded commuter service. The Edmondson and Frederick Road stops were closed on April 27, 1984; they were replaced with West Baltimore station, two blocks to the south of Edmondson Avenue, on April 30. The stairs and platforms were removed, but the station building remains in place as a private business (which it had been converted to even before the stop closed).\n\nIn 2009, it was announced that approximately 400 parking spaces east of Pulaski Street would be added, as part of the project to remove the portion of Interstate 170 (now Route 40) that had never carried vehicular traffic. The spots were not to be permanent, but instead only available until redevelopment of the surrounding neighborhood. The expressway was demolished in the fall of 2010, and the spaces opened soon after.\n\nWest Baltimore station has attracted criticism for being unsafe due to crime and the poor conditions of the platforms and staircases, which are crumbling and rusted. As part of the larger project to repair the Interstate 170 area, the station will be improved over a period of several years. Immediate repairs to the stairs and platforms, as well as improved shelters and lighting, were made in 2014. Ultimately, the platforms will be extended to serve more cars per train and raised for handicapped accessibility, and ramps built to surrounding streets. The Red Line light rail service, originally planned to begin construction in 2015 (before its cancellation that year) and open in 2022, was to run along the Route 40 corridor in the median of the highway underneath the elevated city streets with a stop at West Baltimore. Escalators and elevators would be used to transport commuters from the station to the streets above the Route 40 corridor in West Baltimore.\n\nThe station is also served by 6 MTA Bus routes:\n\n"}

His father's name was De-chhen-gyalpo and his mother's Serab-Drolma. He was soon recognised as the true incarnation of Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, (1570–1662), the Fourth Panchen Lama of Tibet, and was installed with great ceremony at Tashilhunpo Monastery.\n\nHe received novice vows when he was 8 (9 by Western reckoning) in Lhasa from Lozang Gyatso, the Great Fifth Dalai Lama (1617 – 1682), when he was given the name of Lobsang Yeshe. At the age of twenty [21] he was ordained by Kon-chhog Gyal-tsan.\n\nWhen he was thirty-two (in 1696 or 1697), he sent a congratulatory deputation to Beijing. The Kangxi Emperor (1662-1723) invited him to Beijing, but he asked to be excused for fear of smallpox.\n\nThe Regent, Sangye Gyatso (Sangs-rgyas rgya-mtsho), invited the Fifth Panchen Lama, Lobsang Yeshi to administer the vows of a novice monk on the 6th Dalai Lama, at the town of Nangartse on Lake Yamdrok Yamtso, and named him Tsang Gyatso. In October 1697, Tsangyang Gyatso was enthroned as the Sixth Dalai Lama.\n\nIn 1701 Lhasang Khan, a Mongol king and ally of the Chinese, had the Regent, Sangye Gyatso, killed. This greatly upset the young Dalai Lama who left his studies who even visited Lobsang Yeshe, the 5th Panchen Lama in Shigatse and renounced his novice monk vows.\n\nIn 1713 he received a letter written in three different languages, Tibetan, Mongol and Manchu in gold from the Kangxi Emperor, who sent him a large tangka with his title on it.\n\nThe 7th Dalai Lama was enthroned in the Potala Palace in 1720. He took the novice vows of monk-hood from the 5th Panchen Lama Lobsang Yeshi, who gave him the name Kelzang Gyatso. He took the Gelong vows (full ordination) from Lobsang Yeshi in 1726.\n\nIn 1728 the Yongzheng Emperor (1723-1736) sent Aliha Ampan to settle the border between the provinces of U and Tsang. There was a civil war at this time, and the Chinese asked the Panchen Lama if he would rule all the territories between Khambala and Mount Kailash. The Panchen Lama refused a few times on the grounds of old age but was finally convinced to take control of the whole of Tibet lying to the west of Panam, and relinquished possession of Phari, Gyantse, and Yardosho and other places to the government in Lhasa.\n\nHe wrote eighteen volumes of hymns and precepts and died at the age of 75 (74 by Western reckoning), in 1737.\n\nA gilt copper domed tomb, like that of his predecessor, only larger was built for him. Unfortunately, all the tombs from the Fifth to the Ninth Panchen Lamas were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and have been replaced by the 10th Panchen Lama with a huge tomb at Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse, known as the Tashi Langyar.\n"}

It is on the Sokolnicheskaya line, serving as its eastern terminus. The station was opened in 1990. Riders may make an out-of-station transfer to Bulvar Rokossovskogo on the Moscow Central Circle line.\n\nThe station was originally named \"Ulitsa Podbelskogo\" for Podbelskogo Street, which was named for the Bolshevik revolutionary Vadim Podbelsky. Even after the street was renamed in 1991 to Ivanteyevskaya Street, the station's name was unchanged until 2014. On 10 April 2014 Moscow City Commission on Names recommended renaming the station to \"Bulvar Marshala Rokossovskogo\", for Rokossovsky Boulevard, which was named for Soviet Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky. On 8 July, the station was officially renamed to \"Bulvar Rokossovskogo\".\n\nRather than continuing the straight path of the Sokolnicheskaya line to the northeast, Bulvar Rokossovskogo was built to the northwest of Cherkizovskaya, forming a right angle with the rest of the line. This would allow Bulvar Rokossovskogo to eventually become part of a planned second ring line around the city, at which time the Sokolnicheskaya line could presumably be further extended in its original direction.\n\nBeyond Bulvar Rokossovskogo are reversal sidings which are planned to become part of the future \"Big Ring\" line. A junction between Bulvar Rokossovskogo and Cherkizovskaya is used by southbound trains entering and leaving the Cherkizovo depot (No. 13), since the depot is directly connected only to the southbound tunnel.\n\nBulvar Rokossovskogo is a shallow column tri-vault station. The station was designed by architects Nina Aleshin and Natalya K. Samoilova and applied the following theme: ferroconcrete pillars faced with white marble; anodized aluminum arranged in geometric patterns on the walls and two identical entrance vestibules located on either side of Moscow's Circular Railway near the Otkrytoe Shosse.\n"}

{"id": "2197326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197326", "title": "Jhonny Peralta", "text": "Jhonny Peralta\n\nJhonny Antonio Peralta (born May 28, 1982) is a Dominican former professional baseball shortstop and third baseman who played 15 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). The Cleveland Indians signed him as an amateur free agent in his native Dominican Republic in 1999, and he made his major league debut for the Indians on June 12, 2003. He subsequently played for the Detroit Tigers and St. Louis Cardinals. A solid hitter with power, Peralta has rated average defensively. He throws and bats right-handed, stands , and weighs .\n\nPeralta was the 2004 Indians Minor League Player of the Year as well as the International League Most Valuable Player for one of Cleveland's minor league affiliates, the Buffalo Bisons, after batting .326 with 44 doubles, 15 home runs and 86 runs batted in. Buffalo was also the International League champion that same season.\n\nEach year from 2005 through 2015, Peralta reached at least 100 hits, and double figures in both home runs and doubles. He is a three-time MLB All-Star selection. He set single-season home run records for shortstops for two franchises – for the Indians in 2005, and the Cardinals in 2014. While a member of the Tigers in 2013, he served a 50-game suspension for his role in the Biogenesis performance-enhancing drug scandal. In 2017 he batted .204/.259/.204, and in July 2017 he was released by the Red Sox.\n\nThe Cleveland Indians signed Peralta as an amateur free agent in 1999 and assigned him to the Dominican Summer League Indians that season. Peralta batted .303 with a .398 on-base percentage (OBP) and a .514 slugging percentage (SLG); 41 percent of his hits went for extra bases. Those figures were boosted by an unsustainable .373 batting average on balls in play (BABIP). Nevertheless, the Indians promoted him aggressively.\n\nIn 2000, the 18-year-old Peralta played for the Columbus RedStixx, the Class A affiliate of the Indians in the South Atlantic League. He batted .241 in 106 games, playing all but one game at shortstop (the other was at third base). The following season he advanced to the Kinston Indians, the Cleveland Indians High-A affiliate in the Carolina League. In 125 games, he batted .240. In 2002, Peralta moved up to the Double-A Akron Aeros, where he hit .281. In 2003, he batted .257 in 63 games with the Buffalo Bisons. After his 2003 call up to the major leagues, Peralta began to draw widespread attention for his hitting with the Aeros and Bisons.\n\nIn 2004, he batted .326 with 15 home runs (HR) and 86 runs batted in (RBI). He also scored 109 runs and stroked 44 doubles, the most ever in the Bisons' modern era, followed by 39 for Kevin Pillar in 2014. This offensive leap helped him win the International League Most Valuable Player Award that year and helped Buffalo win the Governors' Cup as the International League champions. He also received the Lou Boudreau Award as the Indians' 2004 Minor League Player of the Year.\n\nPeralta made his Major League debut with Cleveland on June 12, 2003, filling in for the injured Gold Glove shortstop Omar Vizquel. He finished with a .227 batting average with four HR and 21 RBIs. The next season, despite his accomplishments at the Triple-A level, Peralta saw just 25 at bats (AB) in eight games at the major league level due to the presence of perennial fan-favorite Vizquel, who left the Indians as a free agent following the 2004 season.\n\nPeralta became Cleveland's full-time starting shortstop early in 2005 and batted .292. On July 3, he became affixed in the Indians' third slot in the batting order. Cleveland then won 23 of their next 33 games to put them one game behind the New York Yankees and Oakland Athletics in the Wild Card race late in August. He joined Woodie Held as the only shortstops in Indians' history to hit at least 20 HR. His 24 HR and 78 RBI set records for an Indians shortstop.\n\nOn March 10, 2006, Peralta agreed to a five-year contract with an option for a sixth year to stay with the Indians until the 2011 season. However, his 2006 season saw a decline both offensively and defensively from the previous season. At the start of spring training in 2007, it was revealed that Peralta suffered from vision problems in 2006 and had corrective LASIK eye surgery to deal with it.\n\nAfter breaking an 0 for 8 skid on May 1, 2009, against the Detroit Tigers, Peralta's 86th career home run with the Indians broke the team record for shortstops Woodie Held had held. His HR was solo, providing the margin of victory for Cleveland in a 6–5 score.\n\nPeralta hit his first inside-the-park home run on July 18, 2010, against Tigers pitcher Andy Oliver on a play in which outfielder Ryan Raburn crashed through the bullpen door attempting to catch the ball.\n\nTen days after hitting his first inside-the-park-home-run against the Tigers, the Indians traded Peralta \"to\" the Tigers for minor league pitcher Giovanni Soto and cash considerations. Because the club had already retired the number 2 – Peralta's uniform number as an Indian – in honor of Hall of Famer Charlie Gehringer, he chose the number 27 instead. On July 30, Peralta hit a home run in his first plate appearance (PA) as a Tiger, and then, another, two plate appearances later. After joining the Tigers, he returned to primarily playing shortstop. He made 46 appearances shortstop, nine at third base, four at designated hitter and two at first base for the remainder of the 2010 season.\nPeralta was named to his first career All-Star Game as a replacement for Derek Jeter on July 8, 2011. He finished the regular season with a career-high .299 batting average and collected 21 home runs and 86 RBI. Playing a full season at shortstop for the first time since 2008, he committed just seven errors in 608 chances for a career-best .988 fielding percentage. Peralta hit his first walk-off home run as a Tiger against the Chicago White Sox on May 4, 2012.\n\nOn June 20, 2013, Peralta hit a walkoff two-run home run off Boston Red Sox closer Andrew Bailey to secure the Tigers' victory, 4–3. It was the Tigers' first walkoff win of the season. That season, Peralta was named to his second AL All-Star team as a reserve shortstop. This was his first selection by player vote (his previous selection was as an injury replacement). Peralta entered the All-Star break with a .303 batting average, eight home runs and 46 RBIs.\n\nHowever, a cloud overshadowed what was shaping to be one of Peralta's best seasons. On August 5, he accepted a 50-game suspension for his role in the Biogenesis performance-enhancing drug scandal. On September 25, the Tigers announced that Peralta would be activated to the 40-man roster following his suspension. He returned two days later for the final series of the regular season. In his shortened regular season, Peralta batted .303 with 11 home runs and 55 RBI in 107 games.\n\nBecause Detroit had acquired rookie shortstop José Iglesias from the Boston Red Sox during the suspension, manager Jim Leyland installed Peralta mainly in left field for the remainder of the season and playoffs. The Tigers, including general manager Dave Dombrowski, expressed exoneration of Peralta's breach following the suspension. Despite derisive chants from fans and actions such as the San Francisco Giants leaving similar violator Melky Cabrera off their playoff roster during their World Series-winning season, the Tigers saw the 50-game suspension as sufficient punishment.\n\nWith the Tigers down 3–0 and facing elimination against the Athletics in Game 4 of the American League Division Series (ALDS), Peralta connected for a three-run home run in the fifth inning. It was \"perhaps the biggest swing of the playoffs for the Tigers so far\", surmised sportswriter Noah Trister. The Tigers eventually won the ALDS but lost to the Red Sox in the American League Championship Series. In ten playoff games, Peralta batted .333 with four doubles, one home run and six runs batted in.\n\nOn November 24, 2013, Peralta signed a four-year contract worth $53 million with the St. Louis Cardinals. Featuring a declining salary structure, the contract commenced with his salary at $15.5 million in 2014, then $15 million, $12.5 million, and finally $10 million in 2017. Without a qualifying offer from the Tigers, the Cardinals were not obligated to return a first-round draft pick.\n\nHowever, the signing drew scrutiny because he had served the suspension for his connection to the Biogenesis scandal. Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Brad Ziegler spearheaded a cacophony of complaints that the 50-game suspension was not enough of a deterrent, because he viewed that it failed to prevent players who violated the collective bargaining agreement's banned substances use policy to receive compensation for their performances equal to those who had not been found to violate the policy. Cabrera had signed with the Toronto Blue Jays for two years and $16 million following his suspension in 2012; however, little protest had arisen from those relatively modest figures.\nCardinals general manager John Mozeliak countered by illustrating that the Cardinals were not self-appointed \"morality police. ... Character and makeup are something we weigh into our decision-making. In his case, he admitted what he did, he took responsibility for it. I feel like he has paid for his mistakes, and obviously if he were to make another one, then it would be a huge disappointment.\" New teammate and Cardinals outfielder Matt Holliday, an outspoken critic of performance-enhancing drugs (PED), declared indemnity. \"I am against PEDs and always will be,\" he said at the Cardinals' winter fan festival. \"But I also am a forgiving person and he served his suspension. That's the rules of the game. I'm happy to have him as a teammate. ... His teammates in Detroit welcomed him back.\" Manager Mike Matheny echoed a similar averment.\n\nOn April 27, 2014, Peralta hit his first multi-homer game in Busch Stadium against the Pittsburgh Pirates. It also gave him six home runs for the month, surpassing Édgar Rentería's club record of five in April he set for shortstops in 2000. Peralta surpassed another team record for shortstops Rentería set in 2000, hitting his 17th home run of the season on August 20. While he produced his usual amount of home runs, his batting average was inconsistent early in the season. In each month from April to August, it progressed from .196 to .237 to .241 to .252 to .270.\n\nWith the second-place Pirates just a game behind in the standings with two left to play for the season, Peralta drove in the go-ahead run in the 10th inning against the Diamondbacks as part of a three-RBI night. He ended the season leading the Cardinals in home runs with 21. Peralta also led the club in doubles (38) and was second in slugging percentage (.443), RBI (75), total bases (248) and games played (157). His batting average was .263 and OBP .336.\n\nIn his first season in the National League (NL), Peralta ranked seventh in the league in doubles and sixth in games played. According to Baseball-Reference.com's advanced metrics, he had his best season defensively, finishing fifth in the NL among all players – third among shortstops – with 2.6 defensive Wins Above Replacement (dWAR). His combined offensive and defensive WAR placed tenth among all NL players at 5.8. In counting and rate defensive statistics among NL shortstops, he finished second in double plays turned (98), and fifth in fielding percentage (.981), putouts (191), assists (418), and range factor per nine innings (4.17). On October 23, \"The Sporting News\" announced Peralta was selected to their NL All-Star team. He finished 15th in the NL MVP voting, the first time in his career he received consideration for the award.\n\nOn May 25, 2015, Peralta hit a walk-off home run in the tenth inning against the Diamondbacks, his seventh home run of the season. In his time with the Cardinals through June 1, he ranked first in extra-base hits (80) and home runs (29), third in RBI (101), second in slugging percentage (.461) and OPS (.804) and fourth in on-base percentage (.361) among MLB shortstops. On defense, he did not rely heavily on range, but on smart positioning and making the routine plays, qualifying him for +1 defensive runs saved after saving 17 the year before.\n\nHe was selected as the National League's starting shortstop in the All-Star Game at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati after batting .298 with 13 home runs and 46 RBI over the first 87 games in 2015. After the All-Star break, he batted .243, and produced three doubles and two home runs over the final two months, or 54 games. Peralta finished the season with a .275 batting average, 17 home runs, 71 RBI, 26 doubles, and 159 hits in 155 games played.\n\nThumb injuries caused Peralta to miss significant time in 2016. While fielding a ball during spring training on March 7, he damaged an ulnar collateral ligament in his left thumb. He underwent surgery to repair the ligament and was expected to miss 10 to 12 weeks of play. He began a rehabilitation assignment with the Single-A Peoria Chiefs on May 20, 2016, and the club activated him for game action before a series against Cincinnati on June 7. The Cardinals placed him back on the on disabled list on July 19 due to swelling in the left thumb, although that injury appeared unrelated to the torn ligament and an MRI had revealed no structural damage, per Mozeliak. In 2017 he batted .204/.259/.204.\nHe was designated for assignment by the Cardinals on June 9, 2017 and he was released on June 13.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox signed Jhonny Peralta on June 23, 2017. The Red Sox were in serious need of a third baseman after Hernandez and Holt suffered season-ending injuries, Rutledge juggled 2B and 3B after an injury to Pedroia, Marrero was struggling with his bat, and an injury-plagued Pablo Sandoval made multiple mistakes at the plate and at the hot corner before an ear infection. The Red Sox were left with Marrero at third, when Dombrowski announced the team would be making serious improvements at third. That came on the same day as the Peralta signing.\n\nPeralta never played in a Major League game for the Red Sox, and on July 13, 2017, he was released by the Red Sox.\n\nThe metrics for Peralta's overall career defense show him as an average shortstop. However, his numbers have improved to the point where he was once a below-average shortstop to being a well above-average defender.\n\n\nPeralta is married to Molly Peralta. The couple have three daughters; including, twins named Gabriela Rose and Laina Katherine.\n\nWhile the spelling of his first name is unusual in the United States, Peralta stated many people use that spelling in the Dominican Republic.\nHe also told the \"Santo Domingo Times\" that his spelling is right and every \"Johnny\" or \"Johnnie\" in the world is wrong.\n\n"}

It was released on 4 May 1998 by Creation Records. The American spelling of \"humor\" is used in the title as the band were, according to Sarah Cracknell, \"fed up with the 'quintessentially English' tag, so there was a bit of a backlash against that.\"\n\nThe album was a departure for the group, who had been associated with the indie dance genre. \"Tiger Bay\", their previous album, had added many acoustic and orchestral elements but still belonged to the synthpop and dance genres, while \"Good Humor\" is more acoustic, having more in common musically with their 1993 hit single \"You're in a Bad Way\". \"Good Humor\" was demoed in the UK using synths and drum machines, but was recorded in Sweden under the guidance of Tore Johansson, who augmented their sound with a full band and a horn section.\n\n\"Good Humor\" was recorded in two weeks at Tambourine Studios, Malmö, Sweden. The album was produced by Tore Johansson, who had produced all of The Cardigans' previous studio albums. Most of the B-sides were also recorded and produced during the two-week sessions. Sarah Cracknell cut short the promotion of her solo album \"Lipslide\" and single \"Goldie\" to record the album.\n\nThe album's opening track, \"Wood Cabin\", contains the lyrics \"Never write a love song/Never write a trip out/Never write a ballad\". These lines are paraphrased from an interview that the Manic Street Preachers did for BBC2's Snub TV in 1991 (\"We'll never write a love song, ever. Full stop. Or a ballad, or a trip-out...\"), when the Manics and Saint Etienne were both signed to Heavenly Records.\n\nSaint Etienne had always been affiliated with Creation Records through Heavenly Records, but \"Good Humor\" was their first release for the label proper. Its original release date was planned for summer 1997 but was delayed by Creation because they were committed to promoting Oasis's album \"Be Here Now\".\n\nIn the United States, the group was signed to the Sub Pop label. A limited edition of the US release contained a bonus disc titled \"Fairfax High\", consisting mostly of B-sides from UK singles. Each of the tracks on the bonus disc is available as part of the 2010 deluxe edition of \"Good Humor\". \"Fairfax High\" was the first of a series of US-only singles, albums and EPs.\n\nThe first single was \"Sylvie\", which reached number twelve on the UK Singles Chart. The band wanted \"Lose That Girl\" to be the second single from the album, but Creation decided on \"The Bad Photographer\", which reached number twenty-seven. \"Lose That Girl\" was scheduled for release by Creation in late 1998 but was scrapped at close to the last minute. Remixes by the Trouser Enthusiasts were produced, but were not pressed to even promo 12\". The Trouser Enthusiasts' remix was later featured as a bonus track on the North American-only B-sides compilation \"Interlude\".\n\nAn instrumental demo of \"Lose That Girl\" and a single mix of \"Sylvie\" by album keyboardist Gerard Johnson are included on the fan club CD \"Nice Price\". The band-written sleeve notes describe the influence of soft rock on the former. The song also had the working title of \"Jazz Odyssey\" (a nod to \"This is Spinal Tap\").\n\nA double-disc deluxe edition of the album was released on 4 October 2010. The bonus disc contained \"Fairfax High\" in its entirety, as well as a number of other tracks.\n\nInitial copies of the UK vinyl LP were issued with a bonus 10\" CRE 290X, which contained the \"Friday Night Boiler Mix\" of \"Sylvie\" and the \"Kid Loco Talkin' Blues Mix\" of \"4:35 in the Morning\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

He had been twice captured by Loyalist forces, escaping after the first time. \n\nHis execution was noted for precipitating one of the first international incidents of the fledgling United States. To retaliate for Huddy's execution, the Continentals wanted to execute a young captive British officer, which would have violated the terms of the Yorktown surrender and was known as the \"Asgill Affair\". The French government, allies of the US, put pressure on the Americans to show the officer mercy, and the Continental Congress voted to order his release, as Washington had turned the issue over to them.\n\nHuddy was born November 8, 1735, to a prosperous family in Salem County, Province of New Jersey, the oldest of seven brothers. His grandfather, Hugh Huddy, was a well-known judge in Burlington. Huddy spent most of his early life in Salem, where he was considered rebellious and a troublemaker. He was disowned by Quakers in Salem in 1757 for his \"disorderly\" conduct. \n\nHis \"rough ways\" continued into adulthood; he was tried and convicted several times for crimes including assault and theft and repeatedly had financial difficulties. He was forced to sell a 300-acre (1.2 km²) plantation in Salem to pay his debts and was forced into debtor's prison for a time. In 1764, he married his first wife, the widowed Mary Borden, by whom he had two daughters, Elizabeth and Martha, before her death.\n\nIn the 1770s, Huddy moved to Colts Neck in Monmouth County. There, on October 27, 1778, he married his second wife, Catherine (Applegate) Hart, also a widow and owner of the Colts Neck Tavern, which she had inherited from her first husband, Levy Hart. Huddy was later accused by the Monmouth County sheriff of trying to steal the tavern from his wife and to force her children out onto the street. He often appeared in civil and criminal court, either as plaintiff or defendant.\n\nHuddy allied with the American revolutionists and engaged in the raids and revenge executions that characterized the intense violence among Monmouth County residents, often involving personal feuds. The actionss continued even after the war. He served as captain of the Monmouth Militia from March to December 1779. Huddy led several raids in which he and his men seized materials allegedly sold illegally to the British in New York; he captured and sometimes executed Loyalists. He was accused of hanging Stephen Edwards, the first Loyalist to die in the county, and 14 others. He denied at least one of the murders.\n\nIn August 1780, Huddy was issued a commission to operate a gunboat, \"The Black Snake\", as a privateer. One month later, he was captured in his house in Colts Neck at night by 25 Loyalist raiders led by Colonel Tye, a former slave. Huddy and his mistress Lucretia Edmonds held off the attackers in a two-hour-long gun battle, but after the Loyalists set fire to his house, Huddy agreed to surrender to if they would extinguish the blaze. Colonel Tye marched Huddy to what is now West Park in Rumson, New Jersey, where he was put on a boat to go to New York, which was occupied by the British. However, Patriots on the other side of the Shrewsbury River fired on the boat, which capsized. Huddy, wounded in the thigh, managed to swim to shore and escape.\n\nOn February 1, 1782, Huddy was given command of the blockhouse, a small fort, at the village of Toms River that was built to protect the local salt works. The salt was needed to cure meat destined for American troops, and the Toms River was an important launch point for Patriot privateers. On March 24, a large irregular force of the Associated Loyalists, an organization headed by William Franklin, overwhelmed Huddy's small band of defenders and took the fort. They destroyed the blockhouse, salt works, local mills, and all but two houses in the village, leaving dozens of people homeless.\n\nAs an officer, Huddy was transferred to a military prison ship at New York, then held by the British. Soon, however, Huddy was removed from British custody by a band of Associated Loyalists, headed by Captain Richard Lippincott, ostensibly for the purpose of making a prisoner exchange. No such exchange was planned, however. Instead, Lippincott's forces took Huddy by boat to Middletown Point, a location on the south coast of Sandy Hook Bay. They landed on the beach at the foot of the Navesink Hills. There, on April 12, 1782, they hanged Huddy after they had allowed him to dictate and sign his will.\n\nIn the rounds of retaliation, Huddy's summary execution by the Loyalists was retaliation for the death in Patriot custody of Loyalist farmer Philip White. The Loyalist executioners left a note on Huddy's breast: \"Up Goes Huddy for Phillip White.\" It was reported in a letter to Washington that Huddy died calmly and bravely, declaring that he would \"Dye [sic] Innocent, and in a good Cause.\"\n\nThe next morning, Patriots found Huddy's body hanging from the gallows, cut it down, and brought it to Freehold, where they buried him at Old Tennent Church. More than 400 people gathered to protest his execution, and a petition was sent to General George Washington to demand retribution by execution of a British officer of similar rank if Captain Lippincott was not surrendered. Both Washington and the commander of British forces in New York, General Sir Henry Clinton, condemned the hanging. The British forbade the Board of Loyalists from removing any additional prisoners. Sir Guy Carleton, Clinton's successor, later abolished the organization.\n\nPatriotic sentiment ran high following the killing of Huddy. In an effort to avert independent reprisals by the New Jersey militia, Washington agreed to the proposition to select a British prisoner of war for retaliatory execution. Washington issued an order to General Moses Hazen to select a British prisoner by lot to be hanged in retribution. Straws were drawn on May 26, 1782 and a young British officer, Captain Charles Asgill, drew the short straw. If Lippincott was not turned over to the Patriots for trial, Asgill was to be killed.\n\nThe situation was complicated by the fact that Asgill and the other British captive officers were protected under the terms of surrender agreed to between British General Charles Cornwallis and Washington following the Siege of Yorktown in October of the previous year. Executing Asgill would have violated the terms of the surrender and created a black eye for the rebellious colonials who were intent upon establishing an independent nation.\n\nWashington turned to an old associate, General Benjamin Lincoln, formerly the second in command of the Continental Army and the acting Secretary of War of the Americans. While he and other ranking Continental Army officers continued to favor a retaliatory killing, they urged patience. The delay ultimately allowed sufficient time for intercession by the Americans' French allies. The mother of the condemned British captain appealed directly for help to French King Louis XVI and his wife, Marie Antoinette. French Foreign Minister Comte de Vergennes was directed to plead Asgill's case to Washington.\n\nCatherine Hart, Huddy's widow, also said that she wanted Asgill's life spared since the captain was innocent. \n\nBacked by diplomatic pressure to lift the execution order, the military turned the issue over to the Continental Congress for decision. Asgill was freed by order of Congress passed on November 7, 1782. Asgill was issued a pass to British lines and returned to Britain. After the war, Lippincott emigrated to Canada, where the Loyalist was granted 3,000 acres (12 km²) by the Crown as a reward for his services to Britain.\n\nHuddy's legacy lives on throughout Central New Jersey, specifically Monmouth County. In Highlands, New Jersey, Huddy Park as well as a street are named after him. A plaque in West Park in Rumson, New Jersey honors Huddy's escape from the capsized boat he was captured on. Another plaque in Colts Neck, New Jersey was erected in 1977. There is also a Huddy Park in Toms River, New Jersey.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2197371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197371", "title": "Citrullus colocynthis", "text": "Citrullus colocynthis\n\nCitrullus colocynthis, with many common names including colocynth, bitter apple, bitter cucumber, desert gourd, egusi, vine of Sodom, or wild gourd, is a desert viny plant native to the Mediterranean Basin and Asia, especially Turkey (especially in regions such as İzmir), and Nubia.\n\nIt resembles a common watermelon vine, but bears small, hard fruits with a bitter pulp. It originally bore the scientific name \"Colocynthis citrullus\".\n\n\"C. colocynthis\" is a desert viny plant that grows in sandy, arid soils. It is native to the Mediterranean Basin and Asia, and is distributed among the west coast of northern Africa, eastward through the Sahara, Egypt until India, and reaches also the north coast of the Mediterranean and the Caspian Seas. It grows also in southern European countries as in Spain and on the islands of the Grecian archipelago. On the island of Cyprus, it is cultivated on a small scale; it has been an income source since the 14th century and is still exported today. It is an annual or a perennial plant (in wild) in Indian arid zones and has a great survival rate under extreme xeric conditions. In fact, it can tolerate annual precipitation of 250 to 1500 mm and an annual temperature of 14.8 to 27.8 °C. It grows from sea level up to 1500 meters above sea level on sandy loam, subdesert soils, and sandy sea coasts with a pH range between 5.0 and 7.8.\n\nThe roots are large, fleshy, and perennial, leading to a high survival rate due to the long tap root. The vine-like stems spread in all directions for a few meters looking for something over which to climb. If present, shrubs and herbs are preferred and climbed by means of auxiliary branching tendrils.\n\nVery similar to watermelon, the leaves are palmate and angular with three to seven divided lobes.\n\nThe flowers are yellow and solitary in the axes of leaves and are borne by yellow-greenish peduncles. Each has a subcampanulated five-lobed corolla and a five-parted calyx. They are monoecious, so the male (stamens) and the female reproductive parts (pistils and ovary) are borne in different flowers on the same plant.\nThe male flowers’ calyx is shorter than the corolla. They have five stamens, four of which are coupled and one is single with monadelphous anther. The female flowers have three staminoids and a three-carpel ovary. The two sexes are distinguishable by observing the globular and hairy inferior ovary of the female flowers.\n\nThe fruit is smooth, spheric with a 5– to 10-cm-diameter and extremely bitter taste. The calyx englobe the yellow-green fruit which becomes marble (yellow stripes) at maturity. The mesocarp is filled with a soft, dry, and spongy white pulp, in which the seeds are embedded. Each of the three carpels bears six seeds. Each plant produces 15 to 30 fruits.\n\nThe seeds are grey and 5 mm long by 3 mm wide.\nThey are edible but similarly bitter, nutty-flavored, and rich in fat and protein. They are eaten whole or used as an oilseed. The oil content of the seeds is 17–19% (w/w), consisting of 67–73% linoleic acid, 10–16% oleic acid, 5–8% stearic acid, and 9–12% palmitic acid. The oil yield is about 400 l/hectare. In addition, the seeds contain a high amount of arginine, tryptophan, and the sulfur-containing amino acids.\n\n\"C. colocynthis\", a perennial plant, can propagate both by generative and vegetative means. However, seed germination is poor due to the extreme xeric conditions, so vegetative propagation is more common and successful in nature. In the Indian arid zone, growth takes place between January and October, but the most favorable period for the vegetative growth is during summer, which coincides with the rainy season. Growth declines as soon as the rains and the temperature decrease and almost stops during the cold and dry months of December and January. Colocynth prefers sandy soils and is a good example of good water management which may be useful also on research to better understand how desert plants react to water stress. To enhance production, an organic fertilizer can be applied.\nColocynth is also commonly cultivated together with cassava (intercropping) in Nigeria.\nCultivated colocynth suffers of climatic stress and diseases such as cucumber mosaic virus, melon mosaic virus, \"Fusarium\" wilt, etc. as any other crop. To improve it, a relatively new protocol for regeneration has been developed with the aim of incorporating disease and stress resistance to increase yield potential and security avoiding interspecific hybridization barriers.\n\n\"C. colocynthis\" can be eaten or elaborated for further uses in medicine and as energy source, e.g. oilseed and biofuel.\nThe characteristic small seed of the colocynth have been found in several early archeological sites in northern Africa and the Near East, specifically at Neolithic Armant, Nagada in Egypt; at sites dating from 3800 BC to Roman times in Libya; and the pre-pottery Neolithic levels of the Nahal Hemar caves in Israel. Zohary and Hopf speculate, \"these finds indicate that the wild colocynth was very probably used by humans prior to its domestication.\"\n\nColocynth has been widely used in traditional medicine for centuries. In premodern European medicine, it was an ingredient in the electuary called \"confectio hamech\", or diacatholicon, and other laxative pills.\n\nIn Arabia the colocynth had numerous uses in traditional medicine, such as a laxative, diuretic, or for insect bites. The powder of colocynth was sometimes used externally with aloes, unguents, or bandages. Troches made of colocynth were called \"troches of alhandal\" used as an emetic.\n\nIn traditional Arab veterinary medicine, colocynth sap was used to treat skin eruptions in camels.\n\nThe seeds of colocynth, which must be heated to remove their bitter bioactive compounds, have been used since antiquity as a food source in areas of the Sahara and Sahel where crops frequently fail or regular farming is impossible. The enigmatic early Egyptian ceramic Clayton rings found in the Western Desert may have been portable ovens for roasting colocynth seeds. The desert Bedouin are said to make a type of bread from the ground seeds. The closely related watermelon (\"Citrullus lanatus\" (Thunb)) was domesticated in Ancient Egypt, and may have been developed for edible seed from cultivated colocynth. In West Africa, some confusion exists between this species and watermelon, whose seeds may be used in much the same way. In particular, the name \"egusi\" may refer to either or both plants (or more generically to other cucurbits) in their capacity as seed crops, or to a popular soup made from these seeds. The seed flour is rich in micronutrients, and could therefore be used in food formulations especially in regions with endemic micronutrient deficiencies, such as West Africa.\n\nThe oil obtained from the seeds (47%) can be used for soap production. The production is not very time- and energy-consuming due to the ability of colocynth to grow on poor soils with just a little moisture and organic fertilizer. The fruits are harvested still unripe by hand, the rind is removed by peeling and the inner pulp filled with seeds is dried in the sun or in ovens. The seeds yield is about 6.7-10 t/ha, which means that for an oil profit of 31-47%, oil yields may reach up to 3 t/ha.\n\nOleic and linoleic acids isolated from \"C. colocynthis\" petroleum ether extracts show larvicidal activity against mosquitoes.\n\n\n"}

He was also a visiting Fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford, from 1956 to 1964. Terrington was an expert on Greek affairs after he first got involved with the resistance forces in Greece against the Germans during World War II, and then having served in the British Embassy.\n\nMontague Woodhouse was the son of Horace Woodhouse, 3rd Baron Terrington, and Valerie Phillips, and was educated at Winchester College, and then at New College, Oxford, where he took a double first in Classics. After completing his education, he enlisted in the Royal Artillery in 1939 and served for the duration of World War II, being commissioned as an officer in 1940 and rising to the rank of colonel by 1943. He was awarded a DSO and appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1944. He served most of his time in the War in Greece where his love for this country grew strong, as shown in his writings. In 1941 he was one of the SOE officers sent to Crete to organize the resistance forces behind enemy lines.\n\nIn September 1942 he was parachuted to mainland Greece as the Second-in-Command of the Harling Force, headed by Eddie Myers, whose task was to blow up the Gorgopotamos bridge. Following the success of this operation Myers and Woodhouse were ordered by SOE Cairo to stay on in mainland Greece and form the British Military Mission. Initially their presence had only been intended for Operation Harling. Woodhouse, being one of only a few British officers on the mission who could speak Greek, was often sent off alone to make contact with political elements in Athens. Due to his imposing appearance of being tall with burning ginger beard this was no mean feat, but he succeeded in numerous trips into the Athenian suburbs, often still wearing British Army uniform. After Myers' dismissal in July 1943, at the request of the Foreign Office, Woodhouse became the head of the British Military Mission.\n\nAfter the conclusion of World War II, Woodhouse served as Second Secretary at the British Embassy in Athens, Greece, until 1946, whereupon he returned to Britain, and served in a variety of industrial and academic appointments. In 1951, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.\n\nFrom 1951 to 1952, he worked at the British Embassy in Tehran, Iran, and in 1952 and 1953 was involved in organising British aspects of the US/UK organised 1953 Iranian coup d'état. From July 1955 to October 1959 was the Director General at the Royal Institute of International Affairs.\n\nIn 1941, the Soviets and the British jointly invaded Iran to secure the oilfields and supply lines and deny support for the Germans. By the 1950s, Britain was concerned by possible chaos in Iran and an invasion by the USSR. From 1951 Woodhouse was a MI6 agent in Tehran, operating under cover of a Foreign Office appointment. In 1952, he was ordered to arm tribesmen in northern Iran to resist any Soviet attack. He brought weapons into Iran, flying them from RAF Habbaniya in Iraq, for a \"resistance\" movement that did not exist as yet.\n\nLater in 1953 a covert mission to remove Mohammed Mossadegh from power was instigated by Britain's Churchill government and the U.S's Eisenhower' administration. Mossadegh had become Iran's democratically elected prime minister and he had nationalised oil possessions of the British-owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (now British Petroleum) after Britain had refused to negotiate away its single most valuable foreign asset. Robin Zaehner had developed contacts in Iran and when the British were expelled, Woodhouse took his contacts to the CIA station chief. Thus a conspiracy to overthrow Mossadegh was staged in a joint mission between the CIA and MI6. The CIA named the operation Operation TPAjax, erroneously referred to as Operation Ajax, TP standing for the Soviet-backed communist Tudeh Party of Iran. British activities were codenamed \"Operation Boot\".\n\nWoodhouse proposed Operation Boot to the Eisenhower administration. It would use \"disenchanted\" Iranian elements of the army, the clergy and the political parties to oust Mossadegh. Together with the CIA he instigated and orchestrated the \"bazaaris\" of Tehran to demonstrate against Mossadegh, demonstrations which led to the deaths of hundreds or possibly thousands of Iranian people. Woodhouse, through the Shah's sister, encouraged the ruler not to abandon the throne.\n\nWoodhouse entered Parliament in 1959 and later served in the Conservative governments of Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home as Parliamentary Secretary for Aviation from 1961 to 1962 and then Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department from 1962 to 1964.\n\nHe was defeated by Evan Luard in the 1966 Labour landslide and then worked at the Confederation of British Industry until 1970, when he was once again returned to Parliament for Oxford. He retained his seat in the February 1974 general election, but lost it (again to Evan Luard) in October.\n\nWoodhouse succeeded to the barony on the death of his elder brother David Woodhouse, 4th Baron Terrington, in 1998. He lost his seat in the House of Lords in the following year as a result of the changes introduced by the House of Lords Act 1999.\n\nLord Terrington married Lady Davidema Katharine Cynthia Mary Millicent Bulwer-Lytton, daughter of Victor Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Earl of Lytton, on 28 August 1945. They had three children:\n\n\nTerrington was the author of several books, including:\n\nShortly before his death, Woodhouse, who succeeded to the family title in 1998, completed the translation into English of the 10-volume \"History Of The European Spirit\", by his friend, the former Prime Minister of Greece, Panayiotis Kanellopoulos.\n\n"}

Despite sending down rather too many no-balls at times, Davis finished the season with 42 first-class wickets and was retained for the following season.\n\nReturning to Glamorgan after World Cup, Davis had another successful season, taking 52 wickets at 26.71 from 15 first-class matches, including three five-wicket innings hauls. 1984 was a successful season for Davis: he took 62 first-class wickets at 27.82 apiece and was unlucky not to be retained by Glamorgan for the following season; they decided instead to employ a certain Javed Miandad.\n\nIn 1985/86 Davis played Sheffield Shield cricket in Australia for Tasmania with moderate success.\n\nIn 1987 he returned to English county cricket with Northamptonshire. For three years he found considerable success, taking a total of 195 wickets at 25.46; his career-best first-class bowling figures of 7-52 came in 1988 in the first innings of the County Championship game against Sussex - noteworthy also for the fact that Davis and David Capel (3-59) bowled unchanged throughout the 32.5 overs of that innings.\n\nDavis endured a final, less than happy, season with Northamptonshire in 1990: he averaged above 60 with the ball in both first-class and one-day cricket, and went for more than five an over in the latter form of the game. His final bowling spell for his county, in the Championship game against Essex, was a disastrous 5-0-37-0 as Graham Gooch and John Stephenson ran riot. With that, Davis bowed out of county cricket for good, and in 1990/91 he went to play for Wellington in New Zealand. It proved a shrewd choice as Davis took 20 first-class wickets at 19.50 in just five matches. After that, there were a couple of exhibition matches against his old county of Glamorgan in 1991, and 54 not out for a World XI against the West Indians at Scarborough, before he returned to the Caribbean for three final domestic games. He did little in any of them, and retired from cricket.\n\nDavis played his first representative match for West Indies Young Cricketers against their English counterparts at Port-of-Spain in August 1976, making an immediate impact by taking 4-35 in his first innings, including the wickets of future Test cricketers David Gower, Mike Gatting and Paul Downton. In 1978 he went to England for the return matches, but it was not until 1979/80 that he made his first-class debut, for Windward Islands against Leeward Islands at St John's.\n\nIn the meantime in 1982, he had made his Test and One Day International debuts for in the 1982/83 series against India, his first wicket in Test cricket being that of Mohinder Amarnath.\n\nIn 1983 Davis was selected for West Indies' World Cup squad, and when brought into the side for the second group match against Australia at Headingley, immediately hit the headlines by taking 7-51, at the time a world record return in ODIs. He was retained for the other four group matches, but took only one more wicket in total and was not selected for the semi-final or final - perhaps unsurprising when one considers that players of the calibre of Marshall, Garner, Holding and Roberts were all in West Indies' squad for the tournament.\n\nHe played in all six Tests in India that winter, taking 14 wickets, but when Australia visited the West Indies in the spring of 1984, Davis was selected for only one Test and one ODI, and despite his experience of English conditions he was at first left out of the party to play England that summer, although when Milton Small was ruled out by a knee injury part-way through the series Davis was drafted into the squad. He played in the fourth Test at Old Trafford, and though he was not particularly effectual with the ball beyond managing to fracture Paul Terry's ulna he did score 77, his highest first-class innings, coming in as nightwatchman on the first day.\n\nIn 1984/85 Davis performed well on home soil after being selected for the last two Tests of the four-game series against New Zealand, taking 10 wickets at 18.80 including a career-best 4-19 at Kingston, and took part in no less than 15 ODIs in Australia.\n\nIn 1986, Davis had fallen away from the Test side as West Indies' fast-bowling production line continued to churn out high-quality pacemen.\n\nDuring success in 1987 county tournament, he was recalled to international duties for one last time in India in 1987/88, taking 13 wickets at exactly 30 in four Tests but only three in his three ODIs, and captained the Windward Islands team in the same season.\n\nIn 1998 Davis, a committed Christian, was left a tetraplegic after suffering spinal injuries as a result of a fall from a tree in St Vincent suffered whilst helping clear land for a new church. He was flown to England for treatment unavailable on the island, and now lives in Worcestershire, England. He has appeared in a film, \"Because of You\", made by Worcestershire County Council's Social Services department; he said of this film, \"People with a disability can often be seen as just takers and so for me, starring in this film gave me the opportunity to give something back to the community\". Several benefit matches have been held with the object of raising money to help him live a more comfortable life, and have featured a number of high-profile cricketers: in 2005 a Lashings Cricket Club side beat a Winston Davis XI by 87 runs in a match graced by such names as Chris Cairns, V. V. S. Laxman and Alvin Kallicharran.\n\n"}

Clobazam was first synthesized in 1966 and first published in 1969. Clobazam was originally marketed as an anxioselective anxiolytic since 1970 and an anticonvulsant since 1984. The primary drug-development goal was to provide greater anxiolytic, anti-obsessive efficacy with fewer benzodiazepine-related side effects.\n\nClobazam is used for epilepsy. It is unclear if there are any benefits to clobazam over other seizure medications for children with Rolandic epilepsy or other epileptic syndromes.\n\nAs of 2005, clobazam is approved in Canada for add-on use in tonic-clonic, complex partial, and myoclonic seizures. Clobazam is approved for adjunctive therapy in complex partial seizures certain types of status epilepticus, specifically the mycolonic, myoclonic-absent, simple partial, complex partial, and tonic varieties, and non-status absence seizures. It is also approved for treatment of anxiety.\n\nIn India, clobazam is approved for use as an adjunctive therapy in epilepsy and in acute and chronic anxiety. In Japan, clobazam is approved for adjunctive therapy in treatment-resistant epilepsy featuring complex partial seizures. In New Zealand, clobazam is marketed as Frisium In the United Kingdom clobazam (Frisium) is approved for short-term (2–4 weeks) relief of acute anxiety in patients who have not responded to other drugs, with or without insomnia and without uncontrolled clinical depression. It was not approved in the US until October 25, 2011, when it was approved for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in patients 2 years of age or older.\n\nIt is also approved for adjunctive therapy for epilepsy in patients who have not responded to first-line drugs and in children who are refractory to first-line drugs. It is not recommended for use in children between the ages of six months and three years, unless there is a compelling need. In addition to epilepsy and severe anxiety, clobazam is also approved as a short-term (2–4 weeks) adjunctive agent in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders to manage anxiety or agitation.\n\nClobazam is also available as an oral suspension in the UK, under the trade name of Tapclob.\n\nClobazam is sometimes used for refractory epilepsies. However, long-term prophylactic treatment of epilepsy may have considerable drawbacks, most importantly decreased antiepileptic effects due to tolerance which may render long-term therapy less effective. Other antiepileptic drugs may therefore be preferred for the long-term management of epilepsy. Furthermore, benzodiazepines may have the drawback, particularly after long-term use, of causing rebound seizures upon abrupt or over-rapid discontinuation of therapy forming part of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.\n\nClobazam should be used with great care in patients with the following disorders:\n\nBenzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders.\n\nCommon side effects include fever, lethargy, sleepiness, drooling, and constipation.\n\n\nIn December 2013 the FDA added warnings to the label for clobazam, that it can cause serious skin reactions, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, especially in the first eight weeks of treatment.\n\n\nOverdose and intoxication with benzodiazepines, including clobazam, may lead to CNS depression, associated with drowsiness, confusion, and lethargy, possibly progressing to ataxia, respiratory depression, hypotension, and coma or death. The risk of a fatal outcome is increased in cases of combined poisoning with other CNS depressants, including alcohol.\n\nClassic (non-anxioselective) benzodiazepines in animal studies have been shown to increase reward seeking behaviours which may suggest an increased risk of addictive behavioural patterns. Clobazam abuse has been reported in some countries, according to a 1983 World Health Organisation report.\n\nIn humans, tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of clobazam may occur and withdrawal seizures may occur during abrupt or overrapid withdrawal.\n\nClobazam as with other benzodiazepine drugs can lead to physical dependence, addiction, and what is known as the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from clobazam or other benzodiazepines after regular use often leads to withdrawal symptoms which are similar to those seen during alcohol and barbiturate withdrawal. The higher the dosage and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Benzodiazepine treatment should only be discontinued via a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen.\n\nClobazam is predominantly a positive allosteric modulator at the GABAA receptor with some speculated additional activity at sodium channels and voltage-sensitive calcium channels.\n\nLike other 1,5-benzodiazepines (For example, arfendazam, lofendazam, or CP-1414S), the active metabolite \"N\"-desmethyl-clobazam has less affinity for the α subunit of the GABAA receptor compared to the 1,4-benzodiazepines. It has higher affinity for α containing receptors, where it has positive modulatory activity.\n\nIn a double-blind placebo-controlled trial published in 1990 comparing it to clonazepam, 10 mg of clobazam was shown to be less sedative than either 0.5 mg or 1 mg of clonazepam.\n\nThe α subtype of the GABA receptor, was shown to be responsible for the sedative effects of diazepam by McKernan et al. in 2000, who also showed that its anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties could still be seen in mice whose α receptors were insensitive to diazepam.\n\nIn 1996, Nakamura et al. reported that clobazam and its active metabolite, \"N\"-desmethylclobazam (norclobazam), work by enhancing GABA-activated chloride currents at GABA-receptor-coupled Cl channels. It was also reported that these effects were inhibited by the GABA antagonist flumazenil, and that clobazam acts more efficiently in GABA-deficient brain tissue.\n\nClobazam has two major metabolites: \"N\"-desmethyl-clobazam and \"4\"-hydroxyclobazam, the former of which is active. The demethylation is facilitated by CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP2B6 and the \"4\"-hydroxyclobazam by CYP2C18 and CYP2C19.\n\nClobazam is a 1,5-benzodiazepine, meaning that its diazepine ring has nitrogen atoms at the 1 and 5 positions (instead of the usual 1 and 4).\n\nIt is not soluble in water and is available in oral form only.\n\nClobazam was discovered at the Maestretti Research Laboratories in Milan and was first published in 1969; Maestretti was acquired by Roussel Uclaf which became part of Sanofi.\n\n"}

Aiken boasted that the Mark III was the fastest electronic computer in the world.\n\nThe Mark III used nine magnetic drums (one of the first computers to do so). One drum could contain 4,000 instructions and has an access time of 4,400 microseconds; thus it was a stored-program computer. The arithmetic unit could access two other drums – one contained 150 words of constants and the other contained 200 words of variables. Both of these drums also had an access time of 4,400 microseconds. This separation of data and instructions is known as the Harvard architecture. There were six other drums that held a total of 4,000 words of data, but the arithmetic unit couldn't access these drums directly. Data had to be transferred between these drums and the drum the arithmetic unit could access via registers implemented by electromechanical relays. This was a bottleneck in the computer and made the access time to data on these drums long – 80,000 microseconds. This was partially compensated for by the fact that twenty words could be transferred on each access.\n\nThe Mark III was finished in September 1949 and delivered to the U.S. Naval Proving Ground at the US Navy base at Dahlgren, Virginia in March 1950.

Iry-Hor's existence was debated, with the Egyptologist Toby Wilkinson contesting the reading and signification of his name. However, continuing excavations at Abydos in the 1980s and 1990s and the discovery in 2012 of an inscription of Iry-Hor in the Sinai confirmed his existence. Iry-Hor is the earliest ruler of Egypt known by name and is sometimes cited as the earliest-living historical person known by name.\n\nIry-Hor's name is written with the Horus falcon hieroglyph (Gardiner sign G5) above a mouth hieroglyph (Gardiner D21). While the modern reading of the name is \"Iry-Hor\", Flinders Petrie, who discovered and excavated Iry-Hor's tomb at the end of the 19th century, read it \"Ro\", which was the usual reading of the mouth hieroglyph at the time. Given the archaic nature of the name, the translation proved difficult and, in the absence of better alternative, Ludwig D. Morenz proposed that the literal translation be retained giving \"Horus mouth\".\nIn the 1990s, Werner Kaiser and Günter Dreyer translate Iry-Hor's name as \"Companion of Horus\". Toby Wilkinson, who contested that Iry-Hor was a king, translated the signs as \"Property of the king\". Following the excavations at Abydos and the discovery of an inscription of Iry-Hor in the Sinai in 2012, Wilkinson's hypothesis is now rejected by most Egyptologists and Iry-Hor is widely accepted as a predynastic king of Egypt.\n\nThe Egyptologists Jürgen von Beckerath and Peter Kaplony also initially rejected the identification of Iry-Hor as a king and proposed instead that the known inscriptions refer to a private person whose name is to be read Wer-Ra, \"wr-r3\" (lit. \"great mouth\"), i.e. reading the bird above the mouth-sign as the swallow hieroglyph G36 rather than the Horus falcon. They translated the name as \"Spokesman\" or \"Chief\". However, continuing excavations of Iry-Hor's tomb at Abydos by Günter Dreyer established that the tomb was of similar dimensions and layout as those of Ka and Narmer and must, therefore, have belonged to a king. This was consequently accepted by von Beckerath and Iry-Hor is now the first entry in the latest edition of von Beckerath's \"Handbook of Egyptian Pharaohs\".\n\nUntil 2012, the name of Iry-Hor had not been found in or next to a serekh, so the identification of Iry-Hor as a king was controversial. Egyptologists Flinders Petrie, Laurel Bestock and Jochem Kahl nonetheless believed that he was indeed a real ruler. They pointed to the distinctive spelling of Iry-Hor's name: the Horus falcon holds the mouth hieroglyph in its claws. On several clay seals, this group of characters is found accompanied by a second, free-standing mouth hieroglyph. This notation is reminiscent of numerous anonymous serekhs held by a Horus falcon with individual hieroglyphs placed close to it rather than within the serekh, as would be expected. Finally, the serekh could have been a convention that started with Ka, whose name has been found both with and without a serekh. Therefore, they concluded that the argument that Iry-Hor was not a king because his name was never found in a serekh was insufficient.\n\nSupporters of the identification of Iry-Hor as a king, such as egyptologist Darell Baker, also pointed to the size and location of his tomb. It is a double tomb, as big as those of Ka and Narmer, located within a sequential order linking the older predynastic \"U\" cemetery with the First Dynasty tombs. Furthermore, Iry-Hor's name is inscribed on a large jar exhibiting the royal Horus falcon and is similar to those found in the tombs of other kings of this period.\n\nIn contrast, some Egyptologists doubted Iry-Hor even existed, precisely because his name never appeared in a serekh, the Horus falcon being simply placed above the mouth sign. Ludwig D. Morenz and Kurt Heinrich Sethe doubted the reading of Iry-Hor's name and thus that he was a king. Morenz, for example, suspected that the mouth sign may simply have been a phonetic complement to the Horus falcon. Sethe understood the group of characters forming Iry-Hor's name as an indication of origin (of the content of a jar and other goods to which clay seals were usually attached). Toby Wilkinson dismissed the tomb attributed to Iry-Hor as a storage pit and the name as a treasury mark. Indeed, \"r-Ḥr\" may simply mean \"property of the king\". Supporting his hypothesis, Wilkinson also noted that Iry-Hor was poorly attested and, until 2012, the only inscription of Iry-Hor outside of Abydos was located in Lower Egypt at Zawyet el'Aryan, while Ka and Narmer have many inscriptions located as far north as Canaan.\n\nDreyer's excavations of the necropolis of Abydos revealed that Iry-Hor was in fact well attested there with over 27 objects bearing his name and that his tomb was of royal proportions.\nFurthermore, in 2012 an inscription mentioning Iry-Hor was discovered in the Sinai, the inscription comprising furthermore an archaic empty serekh on the right of Iry-Hor's name. The inscription mentions the city of Memphis, pushing back its foundation to before Narmer and establishing that Iry-Hor was already reigning over it. Following this discovery, most Egyptologists, including G. Dreyer and the discoverers of the inscription, Pierre Tallet and Damien Laisney, now believe that Iry-Hor was indeed a king.\n\nIry-Hor was most likely Ka's immediate predecessor and thus would have reigned during the early 32nd century BC. He probably ruled from Hierakonpolis over Abydos and the wider Thinite region and controlled Egypt at least as far north as Memphis, since the Sinai rock inscription relates a visit of Iry-Hor to this city. The Egyptologists Tallet and Laisney further propose that Iry-Hor also controlled parts of the Nile Delta.\n\nHe was buried in the royal cemetery of Umm el-Qa'ab near Ka, Narmer and the First Dynasty kings. Iry-Hor's name appears on clay vessels from his tomb in Abydos and a clay seal with the hieroglyphs for \"r-Ḥr\" was found in Narmer's tomb and may refer to Iry-Hor. In total no less than 22 pottery jars incised with Iry-Hor's name have been in Abydos as well as at least 5 ink-inscribed fragments and a cylinder seal.\nA similar seal was also found far to the north in the tomb Z 401 of Zawyet el'Aryan in Lower Egypt. An incision on a spindle whorl found in Hierakonpolis during James E. Quibell and Petrie excavations there in 1900 may refer to him. Finally, the discovery of a rock inscription of Iry-Hor in the Sinai constitutes his northernmost attestation. The inscription shows the name of Iry-Hor on a boat, next to the word \"Inebu-hedj\" meaning \"white walls\", the ancient name of Memphis.\n\nIry-Hor's tomb is the oldest tomb of the Abydos necropolis B in the Umm el-Qa'ab. It comprises two separate underground chambers B1 (6m × 3.5m) and B2 (4.3m × 2.45m) excavated by Petrie in 1899 and later by Werner Kaiser. A further chamber, now known as \"B0\", was uncovered during re-excavations of Iry-Hor's tomb in the 1990s. These chambers have a size similar to those found in the tombs of Ka and Narmer. No superstructure, if there ever was one, survives to this day. Chamber B1 yielded jar fragments incised with his name. Chamber B2 produced another incised jar fragment, a seal impression, several ink inscriptions and vessel fragments bearing the names of Ka and Narmer. Parts of a bed were also found onsite.\n\n\n"}

Initially titular king only of a lesser part of the kingdom, he gained the crown of León (and with it, Galicia) after supplanting his brother Alfonso IV and cousin Alfonso Fróilaz in 931. The scant \"Anales castellanos primeros\" are a primary source for his reign.\n\nHe actively campaigned against the Moors, who referred to him as the Devil due to his ferocity and fervor in battle. He defeated the hosts of the Umayyad caliph, Abderramán III, at the Battle of Simancas (939).\n\nWhen, shortly before his death in 910, Alfonso III of Asturias was forced by his sons to abdicate, the Kingdom of Asturias descended into a period of successional crises among the royal family and their supporters from the regional marcher aristocracies. The kingdom was initially partitioned, with García I receiving León, Ordoño II Galicia and Fruela II the Asturian heartland.\n\nWith the successive deaths of García I (914) and Ordoño (924), these were re-consolidated, Fruela ruling the entirety of what would thenceforth be referred to as the Kingdom of León. His death the next year, 925, again brought about disputed succession and partition. A younger brother, Ramiro, appears to have married Fruela's widow and adopted the royal title, but gained no traction. Instead it was the next generation that rose to the forefront.\n\nAs eldest son of the prior king, Alfonso Fróilaz was crowned but proved unable to extend his power to the entire kingdom and was marginalized by his cousins the three sons of Ordoño II, who had the backing of the Kingdom of Pamplona. These brothers again partitioned the portion of the kingdom they controlled: the eldest, Sancho Ordóñez, ruling in Galicia, Alfonso IV in León, and Ramiro II in the newly conquered lands to the south (al-Andalus chronicler Ibn Hayyan located his court at Coimbra).\n\nWhen Sancho died in 929 his kingdom was absorbed by Alfonso IV, but in a quick succession of events taking place in Leon and Zamora, Ramiro forced the abdication of Alfonso IV, and had him and Fruela II's three sons blinded in order to make them incapable of ruling.\n\nRamiro stood out as an excellent military commander, and expanded remarkably his territories south (Salamanca, Ledesma...) as well as founding or repopulating frontier strongholds (Osma, Clunia...). Ramiro masterminded a Pamplona/León coalition that defeated a joint Andalusian counter-offensive in the Battle of Simancas (939). This victory allowed the advance of the Leonese border of the Duero to the Tormes.\n\nIn the last years of his reign, he lost the support of his Pamplona brother-in-law/son-in-law García Sánchez I, who then helped another brother-in-law, the count Fernán González of Castile, to gain brief \"de facto\" independence. Still in 950 Ramiro launched an expedition to the valley of the Edge and defeated the Cordovan Umayyads at Talavera.\n\nRamiro II married twice, first to his first cousin Adosinda Gutiérrez, daughter of Gutier Osóriz and Ildonzia Menéndez (a sister of Ramiro's mother, queen Elvira Menéndez), and second to Urraca Sánchez of Pamplona, daughter of Sancho I of Pamplona and Toda. By Adosinda, who was also cousin of San Rosendo, Ramiro had Bermudo and Ordoño III, and presumably also daughter Theresa, wife of García Sánchez I of Pamplona. García is referred to as Ramiro's son-in-law by chronicler Ibn Hayyan, and his eldest son by his documented second wife Theresa was named Ramiro, while Theresa would not have been daughter of Ramiro II's second wife, who was her husband's sister. By Urraca, Ramiro had two children, Sancho I of León and Elvira Ramírez.\n\nHe figures prominently in the romantic poem, the \"Miragaia\", which tells the apocryphal story of Ramiro bedding Ortega, the daughter of a local Arab lord. By her he is given a son Aboazar, the progenitor of the Galician/Portuguese Maia family. This Maia tradition was subsequently linked to another legend, that told in the \"Cantar de los Siete Infantes de Lara\" by giving Ramiro and Ortega a daughter Ortega Ramírez, who is made to marry Gustios Gonzalez, grandfather of the legendary \"infantes\" and of hero Mudarra González. Subsequent elaboration of this legend gave further supposed descendants among the Lara family, but these Lara connections are dismissed by modern scholars.\n"}

All found objects present Nebra's name either together with that of his predecessor Hotepsekhemwy or with his successor Nynetjer. Nebra's name never appears alone.\n\nClay seal impressions with Nebra's name were found beneath the causeway of the Pyramid of Unas at Saqqara and inside a large gallery tomb, also at Saqqara. This tomb also yielded several seal impressions with Hotepsekhemwy's name and for this reason it is debated whether the tomb belongs to Nebra or his predecessor Hotepsekhemwy.\n\nIn 2012, Pierre Tallet and Damien Leisnay reported three rock inscriptions with Nebra's horus name found in the south of the Sinai Peninsula. Each rock inscription can be found in a different wadi: Wadi Abu Madawi, Wadi Abu Koua and Wadi Ameyra. The places where Nebra's name is displayed lie along a very old route used for expeditions from the western shore of the Sinai to its inland, where copper and turquoise mines existed. Along the wadis the names of predynastic kings up to pharaohs of the 4th Dynasty are located at the same places.\n\nNebra's serekh name is of great interest to Egyptologists, since it is written with the hieroglyphic sign of the sun, which had not yet become the object of divine adoration during his lifetime. At the time of king Nebra, the most important religious cults were concentrated on the preservation of the dualistic equal status of the state patrons Horus and Seth. Nothing was more important than keeping that divine balance. The kings themselves were seen as the living representation of that godlike pair. The sun was seen as a celestial object controlled either by Horus or, as in the case of king Seth-Peribsen, by Seth. Therefore, the sun was no independent deity yet. The first definite proof of the existence of the sun-deity Ra occurs at the beginning of the 3rd dynasty during the reign of king Djoser in the names of high officials such as Hesyre. And the first definitive detectable proof for a fully established royal sun cult occurs under king Radjedef, the third ruler of the 4th dynasty. He was the first king who connected his birth name with the name of Ra, starting the great religious belief that Egyptian kings were the living representation of the sun alongside Horus and Seth.\n\nTherefore, Nebra's Horus name is problematic regarding its translation and meaning. The typical translation of Nebra's name as \"Ra is my lord\", which would be read \"Raneb\", is questionable, as this would assume that the Sun was already being worshiped as an independent deity. Consequently, Egyptologists have proposed the translation \"Lord of the sun (of Horus)\" which is read \"Nebra\" and implies the pharaoh's rule over the Sun (as a celestial body), which was indeed also under Horus' or Seth's control. Any solar religion or solar symbolism were not yet established in any useful form and it is now thought that king Nebra might actually have been the first king who adopted extended religious thought about the sun and the sky.\n\nThe wife of Nebra is unknown. A “son of the king” and “priest of Sopdu” named \"Perneb\" might have been his son, but since the clay seals providing his name and titles were found in a gallery tomb which is attributed to two kings equally (Nebra and his predecessor, Hotepsekhemwy), it is unclear whose son \"Perneb\" really was.\n\nKing Nebra is commonly identified with the Ramesside-era cartouche-name \"Kakau\", which can be translated as \"The bull of Apis\". This links to the anecdote written by Manetho, who said that under king \"Kêchoós\" (the Greek version of the name \"Kakau\") the deities Apies, the goat of Mendes and \"Menevus\" were \"introduced and worshipped as gods\". This view is questioned by modern Egyptologists, as there was already a cult of Apis established during the 1st dynasty, if not earlier. The name \"Kakau\" itself is problematic for this early pharaoh, as there was no name source from Nebra's time that could have been used to form the word.\n\nThe birth name of Nebra also remains unclear. A theory by Egyptologist Jochem Kahl says that Nebra was the same person as the mysterious king Weneg-Nebti. He points to a vessel fragment made of volcanic ash, which was found in the tomb of king Peribsen (a later ruler during the 2nd dynasty) at Abydos. On the pot sherd he believes there are traces of the weneg-flower beneath the incised name of king Ninetjer. To the right of Ninetjer's name the depiction of the \"Ka\"-house of king Nebra is partially preserved. This arrangement led Kahl to conclude that the weneg-flower and Nebra's name were connected to each other and king Ninetjer replaced the inscription. Kahl also points out that king Ninetjer wrote his name mirrored, so that his name deliberately runs in the opposite direction to Nebra's name. Kahl's theory is the subject of continuing discussion since the vessel inscription is damaged, thus leaving plenty of room for varying interpretations.\n\nEgyptologists such as Jürgen von Beckerath and Battiscombe Gunn identify Nebra with another mysterious early pharaoh: Nubnefer. This link is questioned by other scholars, since the rulers of 2nd Dynasty often wrote their birth and Horus names in the same way (for example: Hor-Nebra → Nisut-Bity-Nebty-Nebra). Thus the name \"Nubnefer\" may be the birth name of a different king.\n\nLittle is known about Nebra's reign. The discovery of sealings bearing Nebra's name together with sealings of Hotepsekhemwy at Saqqara suggests that Nebra conducted the burial of Hotepsekhemwy and was his direct successor. Additional confirmation of this succession is provided by a statue and a stone bowl both bearing Hotepsekhemwy and Nebra's serekhs in juxtaposition.\nOther pot inscriptions and seal impressions surviving from his time only name cult-related and administrative events, such as the \"Erecting of the pillars of Horus\". Under Nebra, the first depiction of the goddess Bastet occurs. The exact duration of Nebra's reign is the subject of investigations. Reconstructions of the well known Palermo Stone, a black basalt table presenting the yearly events of the kings from the beginning of the 1st dynasty up to king Neferirkare in the shape of clearly divided charts, leads to the conclusion that Nebra and his predecessor, king Hotepsekhemwy, ruled altogether for 39 years. Since Nebra has fewer records of his rule than Hotepsekhemwy, Nebra is thought to have ruled for a shorter time. The calculations differ from 29 and 10 years to 25 and 14 years.\n\nAccording to different authors, Nebra ruled Egypt c. 2850 BC, from 2820 BC to 2790 BC (Donald B. Redford), 2800 BC to 2785 BC (Jürgen von Beckerath) or 2765 BC to 2750 BC (J. Málek).\n\nThe location of Nebra's necropolis is unknown. Egyptologists such as Wolfgang Helck and Peter Munro believe that Nebra was buried in the gallery tomb B beneath the causeway of the Pyramid of Unas at Saqqara. Indeed, most of the artifacts bearing Raneb's name were found there.\n\n"}

{"id": "2197495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197495", "title": "Weneg (pharaoh)", "text": "Weneg (pharaoh)\n\nWeneg (or Uneg), also known as Weneg-Nebty, is the throne name of an early Egyptian king, who ruled during the second dynasty. Although his chronological position is clear to Egyptologists, it is unclear for how long King Weneg ruled. It is also unclear as to which of the archaeologically identified Horus-kings corresponds to Weneg.\n\nThe name ‘Weneg’ is generally accepted to be a \"nebti\"- or throne name, introduced by the crest of the \"Two Ladies\" (the goddesses Nekhbet and Wadjet) and the sedge-and-bee-crest. Weneg's name appears in black ink inscriptions on alabaster fragments and in inscriptions on schist-vessels. Seventeen vessels bearing his name have been preserved; eleven of them were found in the underground galleries beneath the step pyramid of king Djoser at Sakkara. Egyptologists such as Wolfgang Helck and Francesco Tiradritti point out that all the inscriptions are made in the place of existing inscriptions, which means that the names that were originally placed on the vessels were completely different.\n\nThe symbol that was used to write Weneg's name is the object of significant dispute between Egyptologists to this day. The so-called \"weneg flower\" is rarely used in Egyptian writing. Mysteriously, the weneg flower is often guided by six vertical \"strokes\", three of them on each side of the flower bud. The meaning of these strokes is unknown. After Weneg's death, his heraldic flower was not used again until king Teti (6th dynasty), when it was used in his pyramid texts to name a “Weneg” as a sky and death deity which was addressed with \"Son of Ra\" and \"follower of the deceased king\". So it seems that the weneg flower was somehow connected with the Egyptian sun and death cult. But the true meaning of the flower as a king's name remains unknown.\n\nSince Weneg's name first became known to Egyptologists, scholars have been trying to match the \"nebti\" name of Weneg to contemporary Horus-kings. The following sections discuss some of the theories.\n\nEgyptologist Jochem Kahl argues that Weneg was the same person as king Raneb, the second ruler of the 2nd dynasty. He points to a vessel fragment made from an igneous material, which was found in the tomb of king Peribsen (a later ruler of the 2nd dynasty) at Abydos. He believed he had found on the pot sherd weak, but clear, traces of the weneg flower beneath the inscribed name of king Ninetjer. On the right side of Ninetjer's name the depiction of the \"Ka\" house of king Raneb is partially preserved. The complete arrangement led Kahl to the conclusion that the weneg flower and Raneb's name were connected to each other and king Ninetjer later replaced the inscription. Kahl also points out that king Ninetjer wrote his name mirrored, so that his name points in the opposite direction to Raneb's name. Kahl's theory is the subject of continuing debate since the vessel inscription is badly damaged and thus leaves plenty of room for varying interpretations.\n\nEgyptologists such as Nicolas Grimal, Wolfgang Helck and Walter Bryan Emery identify Weneg with king Sekhemib-Perenmaat and with the Ramesside royal cartouche-name Wadjenes. Their theory is based on the assumption that Sekhemib and Seth-Peribsen were different rulers and that both were the immediate successors of king Ninetjer. But this theory is not commonly accepted, because clay seals of Sekhemib were found in the tomb of king Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the 2nd dynasty. The clay seals set Sekhemib's reign close to Khasekhemwy's, whilst the Ramesside name \"Wadjenes\" is placed near the beginning of the 2nd dynasty.\n\nEgyptologists such as Peter Kaplony and Richard Weill argue that Weneg was a separate king from other kings of the period. They suggest that Weneg succeeded Ninetjer and his name is preserved in Ramesside kinglists under the name \"Wadjenes\". Their assumption is firstly based on the widely accepted theory that Ramesside scribes interchanged the weneg flower with the papyrus haulm, changing it into the name \"Wadjenes\". Secondly, Kaplony and Weill's theory is based on the inscription on the Cairo stone. They believe that the name \"Wenegsekhemwy\" is preserved over the third line of year events. This theory is also not widely accepted, as the Cairo stone is badly damaged and the very weak traces of the hieroglyphs leave too much room for different interpretations.\n\nLittle is known about Weneg's reign. The vessel inscriptions mentioning his name only show reports about ceremonial events, such as the \"raising up of the pillars of Horus\". This feast is frequently reported on vessels from Ninetjer's reign, which brings Weneg's chronological position very close to that of Ninetjer.\n\nThe length of Weneg's rulership is unknown. If he was the same person as king Wadjenes, he ruled (according to the Royal Canon of Turin) for 54 years. If Weneg was the same person as king \"Tlas\", mentioned by the historian Manetho, he ruled for 17 years. But modern Egyptologists have doubts about both statements and evaluate them as misinterpretations or exaggerations. If Weneg was actually a separate ruler, as Richard Weill and Peter Kaplony believe, he may have ruled for 12 years, depending on their reconstructions of the Cairo stone inscriptions.\n\nOne theory suggests that the once unified kingdom of Egypt was divided after Ninetjer's death into two parts. Consequently, for a period after king Weneg's death, two kings ruled at the same time over Egypt suggesting that Weneg was an independent ruler. This assumption is based on the observation that both the Thinite and Memphite king lists of the Ramesside era mention the names \"Wadjenes\" and \"Senedj\" as the immediate successors of king Ninetjer. The Abydos king lists, for example, mention only six kings for the 2nd dynasty, whilst all the other kinglists mention nine kings. So Weneg may have been the last king who had ruled over the whole of Egypt, before sharing his throne (and control over Egypt) with another king. It remains unclear who the other king may have been. Weneg's successor may have been Senedj but even that is uncertain in this shadowy period of the 2nd dynasty of Egypt.\n\n"}
{"id": "2197498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197498", "title": "Louise Lasser", "text": "Louise Lasser\n\nLouise Marie Lasser (born April 11, 1939) is an American actress, television writer and performing arts teacher and director. She is known for her portrayal of the title character on the soap opera satire \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\". She was married to Woody Allen and appeared in several of his early films. She is also a life member of The Actors Studio and studied with both Sanford Meisner and Robert X. Modica.\n\nBorn in New York City, Lasser is the daughter of tax expert S. Jay Lasser, author of the successful \"Everyone's Income Tax Guide\" series in the '70s and '80s. Louise Lasser's family was Jewish and Lasser was an only child. For three years, she studied political science at Brandeis University. In 1964, Lasser's mother Paula committed suicide following the breakup of her marriage to S. Jay, who eventually also took his own life.\n\nLasser was the understudy for Barbra Streisand in the Broadway musical \"I Can Get It for You Wholesale\". She also acted on the soap opera \"The Doctors\" and in television commercials.\n\nShe appeared in the Woody Allen films \"Take the Money and Run\" (1969), \"Bananas\" (1971), and \"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)\" (1972), as well as being one of the voices for his earlier spoof dubbing of a Japanese spy movie, \"What's Up Tiger Lily?\" (1966).\n\nLasser was also featured in comedies such as \"Such Good Friends\" (1971) and \"Slither\" (1973). She appeared in episodes of \"Love, American Style\" in 1971, \"The Bob Newhart Show\" in 1972 and \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" in 1973. In 1973, she also appeared in the TV-movie version of Ingmar Bergman's \"The Lie\" and as Elaine in \"The Roller Coaster Stops Here\" episode of the NBC romantic anthology series \"Love Story\".\n\nLasser became a household name for starring as the neurotic, unhappy housewife Mary Hartman in the serialized satire \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\" and during the show's run appeared on the covers of \"Newsweek\", \"People\", and \"Rolling Stone\". \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\" aired five nights a week for two seasons from 1976 to 1977. In his autobiography, producer Norman Lear says that the casting of Lasser took less than a minute after Charles H. Joffe told him there was only one actress to play the part of Mary Hartman, and Lear met the former Mrs. Woody Allen. Lasser initially refused the role. Of the casting process, Lear said \"when she read a bit of the script for me, I all but cried for joy ... Louise brought with her the persona that fit Mary Hartman like a corset.\"\n\nExhausted from the grueling schedule, Lasser left the series after two seasons (325 episodes), and the serial was re-branded \"Forever Fernwood\", which continued for 26 weeks focusing on the trials and tribulations of the other \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\" characters.\n\nIn 2000, Lasser appeared on a panel with her former cast members at the Museum of Television and Radio in Beverly Hills (taped for the museum archives). Lasser was interviewed about the series in the bonus features of the \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\" Complete Series DVD box-set from Shout Factory, released in December 2013. In it, she reveals that the idea for Mary Hartman's nervous breakdown at the end of the first season came after she wrote a 12-page letter suggesting the idea to Norman Lear.\n\nIn the spring of 1976 in Los Angeles, Lasser was arrested at a charity boutique, and police found $6 worth (or 88 milligrams) of cocaine in her purse. Authorities were called after Lasser's American Express card was denied and Lasser refused to leave without possession of a $150 dollhouse. Lasser was initially apprehended for two unpaid traffic tickets (one for jaywalking), but the officers then found the drug in her handbag. Lasser claimed the coke had been given to her several months earlier by a fan. Ultimately, Lasser was ordered to do six months in counseling, which was easily satisfied as she was already seeing an analyst. A fictionalized version of the dollhouse incident was also incorporated into \"Mary Hartman\"'s first season.\n\n\"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\" offers \"Kitchen Sink Theater of the Absurd\" wherein a Candide-esque TV-watching housewife believes that a consumer culture broadcasting the evils of waxy yellow buildup and virtues of frozen tacos is seeking to make her a better person. In one signature episode, Mary brings a sick neighbor a bowl of chicken soup, only to have him fall asleep and drown in it. \"I have actually taken a human life with my chicken soup,\" Mary laments. While some called the production ahead of its time, Lasser has pointed out that it also reflects its time period perfectly: The program is perhaps an amusing-if-downbeat post-Watergate tribute in which we record and re-listen to each one of our thoughts to figure out if any of them actually makes any sense, or if they all should be redacted. During her appearance on \"The David Susskind Show\", Mary memorably mutters, \"Erase, erase.\"\n\nAs author Claire Barliant writes: \"For some, the 1970s...was a descent into chaos, a dissolution of self, but also a kind of awakening...The Seventies' nervous breakdown coincides with women's lib and a strengthening gay rights movement...\"MH2\" is relevant today because it entertains but still shocks, because the social commentary and satire and bravery of the show are as fresh as ever.\" Moreover, Lasser as the series' figurehead aptly embodies both the insanity and enlightenment of the epoch.\n\nIn 2004 and 2007, \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\" was ranked #21 and #26 on \"\"TV Guide\"s Top Cult Shows Ever\".\n\nOn July 24, 1976, Lasser hosted the penultimate episode of \"Saturday Night Live\"s first season. Her performance is best known for her opening monologue in which she re-creates a Mary Hartman-esque nervous breakdown and locks herself in her dressing room. She is then coaxed out by Chevy Chase/Land Shark and the promise of appearing on the cover of \"Time.\"\n\nSome reports claim that Lasser's erratic behavior on the show led to her being the first person banned from \"SNL.\" Chase accused her of \"solipsism,\" and \"SNL\" writer Michael O'Donoghue called her \"clinically berserk\" and allegedly walked off that week's installment in disgust. O'Donoghue claimed: \"She was a nice woman going through a few problems, but I wanted to force her to eat her goddamn pigtails at gunpoint.\"\n\nHowever, Lasser denies that she was ever forbidden from coming back. By Lasser's account, she was initially told she would be able to write her own material but that term was later reneged on and she also refused to do sketches she deemed \"salacious\": one in particular featured Lasser and Gilda Radner as teenagers talking about male genitalia. Lasser attests: \"At the last minute my manager said they’re not going to cut it. So I said then I’m going to go. And he said are you serious, you’re going to make an ultimatum out of this? And I said, I think so.\" Jane Curtin appeared in the skit with Radner instead.\n\nLasser also asserts that her \"SNL\" antics—which include stream-of-consciousness rambling (already typical of her Mary Hartman character) -- were \"on purpose\" and that Lorne Michaels pulled repeats of the broadcast only at her manager's request because her manager was not fond of the whole affair, including the final segment in which the actress sat onstage to discuss her rise to fame and the dollhouse incident. Lasser mostly performs by herself on the program but also appears in a vignette with a dog at a table.\n\nIn terms of her interaction with the \"SNL\" cast members, Lasser called Chase \"like-a-bully mean\" but Radner \"a doll.\" Aside from the intro segment in which Radner and Dan Aykroyd knock on her changing room door, Chase was the only regular player with whom Lasser had any scenes. Lasser and Chase appear as lovers in an Ingmar Bergman parody; plus, the pair filmed a sequence at the Madison Square Garden DNC (although the footage was never aired). Instead, there is a video short in a diner in which she and her partner, played by Alan Zweibel, try to break up but forget their lines; in the end, Lasser moves to the bar to meet her potential new love interest, Michael Sarrazin. Lorne Michaels also briefly shows up in the clip, which ends with \"a film by Louise Lasser\" credit.\n\nAccording to Lasser, \"He [Lorne Michaels] had invited me to come back; he said come back in two weeks and do another show...It was sad because I believed in people and if they said they were going to do something...for me to threaten to walk off the show, I would never do that for spite. Banned—that’s a horrible thing to have said.\"\n\n\"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\" producer Norman Lear and co-star Mary Kay Place also hosted \"Saturday Night Live (SNL)\" during the run of \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.\"\n\nFollowing her departure from \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\", Lasser wrote a made-for-TV movie titled \"Just Me and You\" (1978), starring in it with Charles Grodin.\n\nHer post-\"MH2\" stage credits include \"Marie and Bruce\" (1980) and \"A Coupla White Chicks Sitting Around Talking\".\n\nShe had a recurring role as Alex's ex-wife on the hit series \"Taxi\" and starred in the 1981–82 season of \"It's a Living\", playing waitress Maggie McBurney.\n\nLasser had a recurring role on \"St. Elsewhere\" in the mid-1980s as Victor Ehrlich's Aunt Charise, a neurotic comic character. Her 1980s film appearances included \"Stardust Memories\" (1980), \"In God We Tru$t\" (1980), \"Crimewave\" (1985), \"Blood Rage\" (1987), \"Surrender\" (1987), \"Rude Awakening\" (1989), and as the mother of the main character in \"Sing\" (1989).\n\nHer 1990s films included \"Frankenhooker\" (1990), \"The Night We Never Met\" (1993), \"Sudden Manhattan\" (1996), \"Layin' Low\" (1996), and as the mother of the three main female characters in Todd Solondz's film \"Happiness\". She appeared in \"Mystery Men\" (1999) as the mother of Hank Azaria's character. She also had roles in Darren Aronofsky's film \"Requiem for a Dream\" (2000), the romantic comedy \"Fast Food Fast Women\" (2000) and co-starred with Renée Taylor in \"National Lampoon's Gold Diggers\" (2003). Lasser acted in two episodes of HBO's \"Girls\" as a Manhattan artist for the series' third season (2014).\n\nLasser was the first woman to win a Clio Award, Best Actress in a Commercial (1967), and was also nominated for an Emmy for her performance in \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\". She won the National Board of Review Award for Best Acting by an Ensemble for her participation in the film \"Happiness\".\n\nLasser was married to Woody Allen from 1966 to 1970.\n\nShe has been a faculty member of HB Studio, where she taught acting technique.\n\nIn 2014, she directed the Off-Off-Broadway production of Ira Lewis' \"Chinese Coffee\".\n\nCurrently, she lives in Manhattan, New York, and runs her own Louise Lasser Acting Studio on the Upper East Side.\n\n"}
{"id": "2197500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197500", "title": "Senedj", "text": "Senedj\n\nSenedj (also known as Sened and Sethenes) was an early Egyptian king (pharaoh), who may have ruled during the 2nd dynasty. His historical standing remains uncertain. His name is included in the kinglists of the Ramesside era, although it is written in different ways: While the kinglist of Abydos imitates the archaic form, the Royal Canon of Turin and the kinglist of Sakkara form the name with the hieroglyphic sign of a plucked goose.\n\nIt is unknown how long Senedj ruled over Egypt. The Royal Canon of Turin credits him with 70 years of rulership, the ancient Greek historian Manetho states that \"Séthenes\" (as he calls Senedj) ruled for 41 years.\n\nThe possibly only known contemporary inscription from Senedj's reign was found in 1909 by Egyptologist Uvo Hölscher, who assisted the excavations at the Khephren- and Menkaura temple at Giza. Hölscher found a small, thin-walled and polished diorite shard, which once belonged to a flat bowl. At the left breakline an incised inscription gives the reading: \"The king of Upper- and Lower Egypt, Senedj\". The inscription goes from the right to the left and exceeds the breakline, but the king's name remains reconstructable. The precious artifact was published in 1912. It was also examined by George Andrew Reisner, who mentioned it shortly in his book \"Mycerinus, the Temples of the Third Pyramid at Giza\".\n\nThe next source referring to king Senedj dates back to the beginning or middle of the 4th dynasty. The name, written in a cartouche, appears in the inscription on a false door belonging to the mastaba tomb of the high priest Shery at Sakkara. Shery held the title “overseer of all wab-priests of king Peribsen in the necropolis of king Senedj”, “overseer of the ka-priests of king Senedj” and “god's servant of Senedj”. Senedj's name is written in archaic form and set in a cartouche, which is an anachronism, since the cartouche itself was not used until the end of 3rd dynasty under king Huni. Egyptologist Dietrich Wildung points to two further priests and possible relatives of Shery, who both also participated the funerary cult of Senedj, \"Inkef\" and \"Siy\".\n\nSenedj is also mentioned in papyrus \"P. Berlin 3038\", which contains medical prescriptions and therapies for numerous diseases. One of these gives instructions for treating foot cramps, and closes with the claim that the recipe for the ointment originates from a \"book of vessels\". This book is claimed to originate from the time of king Usáphais (identical with king Horus Den of Dynasty I). King Senedj allegedly received the book as an inheritance gift.\n\nThe latest mention of Senedj's name appears on a small bronze statuette in the shape of a kneeling king wearing the White Crown of Upper Egypt and holding incense burners in its hands. Additionally, the figurine wears a belt which has Senedj's name carved at the back.\n\nEgyptologist Peter Munro has written a report about the existence of a mud seal inscription showing the cartouche name \"Nefer-senedj-Ra\", which he thinks to be a version of “Senedj”. But since the finding was never photographed nor drawn and the alleged object meanwhile got lost, Munro's claim is highly questioned by many scholars.\n\nThe horus name of Senedj remains unknown. The false door inscription of Shery might indicate that Senedj is identical with king Seth-Peribsen and that the name \"Senedj\" was brought into the kinglists, because a seth-name was not allowed to be mentioned. Other Egyptologists, such as Wolfgang Helck and Dietrich Wildung, are not so sure and believe that Senedj and Peribsen were different rulers. They point out that the false door inscription has the names of both strictly separated from each other. Additionally, Wildung thinks that Senedj donated an offering chapel to Peribsen in his necropolis. This theory in turn is questioned by Helck and Hermann A. Schlögl, who point to the clay seals of king Sekhemib found in the entrance area of Peribsen's tomb, which might prove that Sekhemib buried Peribsen, not Senedj.\n\nEgyptologists such as Wolfgang Helck, Nicolas Grimal, Hermann Alexander Schlögl and Francesco Tiradritti believe that king Nynetjer, the third ruler of 2nd dynasty, left a realm that was suffering from an overly complex state administration and that Nynetjer decided to split Egypt to leave it to his two sons (or, at least, two chosen successors) who would rule two separate kingdoms, in the hope that the two rulers could better administer the states. In contrast, Egyptologists such as Barbara Bell believe that an economic catastrophe such as a famine or a long lasting drought affected Egypt. Therefore, to better address the problem of feeding the Egyptian population, Nynetjer split the realm into two and his successors founded two independent realms until the famine came to an end. Bell points to the inscriptions of the Palermo stone, where, in her opinion, the records of the annual Nile floods show constantly low levels during this period.\n\nBell's theory is refuted today by Egyptologists such as Stephan Seidlmayer, who corrected Bell's calculations. Seidlmayer has shown that the annual Nile floods were at usual levels at Nynetjer's time up to the period of the Old Kingdom. Bell had overlooked that the heights of the Nile floods in the Palermo stone inscription only takes into account the measurements of the nilometers around Memphis, but not elsewhere along the river. Any long-lasting drought can therefore be excluded.\n\nIt is also unclear if Senedj already shared his throne with another ruler, or if the Egyptian state was split at the time of his death. All known kinglists such as the Sakkara list, the Turin King List and the Abydos table list a king Wadjenes as predecessor of Senedj. After Senedj, the kinglists differ from each other in respect of the successors. While the Sakkara list and the Turin canon mention the kings Neferka(ra), Neferkasokar and Hudjefa I as immediate successors, the Abydos list skips them and lists a king \"Djadjay\" (identical with king Khasekhemwy). If Egypt was already divided when Senedj gained the throne, kings like Sekhemib and Peribsen would have ruled Upper Egypt, whilst Senedj and his successors, Neferka(ra) and Hudjefa I, would have ruled Lower Egypt. The division of Egypt was brought to an end by king Khasekhemwy.\n\nIt is unknown where Senedj was buried. Toby Wilkinson assumes that the king might have been buried at Sakkara. To support this view, Wilkinson makes the observation that mortuary priests in earlier times were never buried too far away from the king for whom they had practised the mortuary cult. Wilkinson thinks that one of the Great Southern Galleries within the Necropolis of King Djoser (3rd dynasty) was originally Senedj's tomb.\n\n"}
{"id": "2197507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197507", "title": "Seth-Peribsen", "text": "Seth-Peribsen\n\nSeth-Peribsen (also known as Ash-Peribsen, Peribsen and Perabsen) is the serekh name of an early Egyptian monarch (pharaoh), who ruled during the Second Dynasty of Egypt (c. 2890 – c. 2686 BC). His chronological position within this dynasty is unknown and it is disputed who ruled both before and after him. The duration of his reign is also unknown.\n\nPeribsen's name is unusual, in that Set, not Horus, was his patron deity. This goes against the Egyptian tradition of a king choosing the falcon-shaped deity Horus as his royal patron.\n\nPeribsen's tomb was discovered in 1898 at Abydos. It was well preserved and showed traces of restoration undertaken during later dynastic periods.\n\nThe serekh for Peribsen was found pressed in earthen jar seals made of clay and mud and in inscriptions on alabaster, sandstone, porphyry and black schist vessels. These seals and vessels were excavated from Peribsen's tomb and at an excavation site in Elephantine. One clay seal with Peribsen's name was found inside the mastaba tomb K1 at Beit Khallaf.\n\nTwo large tomb stelae made of granite were found at his burial site. Their shape is unusual and they appear unfinished and rough. Egyptologists suspect that this was done deliberately, but the reasons are unknown. A cylinder seal of unknown provenance shows Peribsen's name inside a cartouche and gives the epithet \"Merj-netjeru\" (\"beloved of the gods\"). This arrangement leads Egyptologists and archaeologists to the conclusion that the seal must have been created later, in memoriam, because the use of royal cartouches began long after Peribsen's reign. Another seal of the same material shows Peribsen's name without a cartouche, but with the royal title \"Nisut-Bity\" (\"king of Upper- and Lower Egypt\") instead.\n\nExisting skeptical views about Peribsen's existence are based on New Kingdom Ramesside king lists, such as the Abydos King List, the Saqqara King List and the Royal Canon of Turin, which all omit Peribsen's name. These, however, are known to have been created nearly 1,500 years after his death and several Fourth Dynasty tombs of priests performing the funerary cult for Peribsen have been uncovered. These tombs report Peribsen's name correctly and their existence demonstrates that Peribsen was seen as a legitimate pharaoh, not subject to damnatio memoriae as Akhenaten later would be. Historians and Egyptologists therefore consider the possibility that Peribsen's name was actually forgotten over time or that his name was preserved in a distorted, misspelled form.\n\nPeribsen's royal name is a subject of curiosity for Egyptologists because it is connected to the deity Seth rather than Horus, as was traditional for the name of a pharaoh. Traditionally, the Horus name of the king was written within a serekh: the image of the facade of the royal palace beneath a falcon representing the god Horus (see Hieroglyphics). Instead, Peribsen chose to have the Set animal, representing Seth, on his serekh. Although Peribsen is the only known pharaoh to have the Set animal preside alone over his serekh, he is not the only king to associate himself with Seth. Examples include the 13th dynasty pharaoh Seth Meribre, the 19th dynasty rulers Seti I and Seti II and the 20th dynasty king Setnakhte.\n\nThe debate continues over why Peribsen chose this name. Earlier theories favoured the idea that Egypt was split into two realms during Peribsen's time or that he was a heretic who sought to start a new monotheistic religion with Seth as the only worshipped god. However, newer evidence and evaluations tend to show that the Egyptian kingdom was unified, but witnessed a vast and profound reform during the Second Dynasty. Seal impressions from tombs of this era reveal great changes in the titles held by high officials, pointing to a reduction of their power. Further seal impressions show that several deities were worshipped under Peribsen, refuting the monotheism theory. Other contemporary inscriptions indicate that Egyptian grammar was perfected during his time: In particular, the earliest seal impressions with complete sentences date back to Peribsen's reign. Thus, Peribsen's reign was in fact a time of cultural and religious advancement.\n\nPeribsen's choice of patron, and his rule during the shadowy period of the mid-Second Dynasty, have led Egyptologists and historians to search for possible explanations for both his name and the troubled times he lived in. The following sections discuss some of the theories that they have put forth.\n\nA theory that was popular until the mid-20th century, supported by Egyptologists Percy Newberry, Jaroslav Černý, Walter Bryan Emery and Bernhard Grdseloff held that Peribsen was a heretic who sought to introduce a new, monotheistic state religion to Egypt, with Seth as the only worshipped god. Peribsen's actions were thought to be similar to those of the much later 18th Dynasty pharaoh Akhenaten, who had required Egyptians to serve only the Aten. Newberry proposed that the priests of Horus and Seth fought each other \"in the manner of a War of the Roses\" during the second half of the Second Dynasty.\n\nThe \"heretic Peribsen\" theory was based on three observations: that the name \"Peribsen\" was excluded from later king lists, that the king's tomb had been destroyed and plundered during antiquity and, finally, that the tomb stelae of Peribsen, that once displayed the Set animal, were badly scratched with the clear intention of effacing the Seth image. Egyptologists hypothesized these were the actions of religious opponents to the Sethian priest-caste. Lauer and Firth relied on the \"heretic Peribsen\" theory to explain the enormous quantity of stone vessels inscribed with the name of First and Second Dynasty kings found beneath Djoser's pyramid in bags bearing seals of Khasekhemwy and Djoser. They proposed that Peribsen had plundered the tombs of his predecessors, followers of Horus, and scattered their funerary equipment. These vessels were gathered in the royal treasury during Khasekhemwy's reign following his reunification of Egypt, and finally put beneath the Step Pyramid by Djoser, in an act of pious devotion.\n\nToday this theory, as well as Lauer and Firth's conclusions, is widely questioned. Archaeological evidence of Peribsen has been found almost entirely in Upper Egypt. In particular, his name does not appear in Lower Egyptian records surviving from that time. It is argued that Peribsen may not have ruled over all of Egypt and therefore did not have the authority to force a change in state religion. Another piece of evidence that argues against the \"heretic Peribsen\" theory is the false door of the priest Shery at Saqqara. Shery held office during the early Fourth Dynasty. The inscription on the false door connects the name of Peribsen in one sentence with another shadowy king of the Second Dynasty, Senedj. According to the addendum, Shery was \"\"overseer of all wab-priests of king Peribsen in the necropolis of king Senedj, in his mortuary temple and at all other places\"\". This implies that the funerary cult of Peribsen continued at least until the Fourth Dynasty, inconsistent with the assumption that Peribsen's name was not allowed to be mentioned. Additionally, Egyptologists such as Herman te Velde point out that Shery was not the only Fourth Dynasty priest participating in the funerary cult of Peribsen. Inkef, possibly a brother or cousin of Shery, also held the title of a \"supervisor of Ka-priests of Peribsen\".\n\nSeal impressions found in Peribsen's tomb at Abydos show several deities: Ash, Min and Bastet, suggesting they were venerated during Peribsen's time on the throne. This finding argues against Peribsen worshipping a single god, or promoting monotheism. The heretic theory of Newberry, Černý, Grdseloff and others was devised from the very limited archaeological information available during their lifetimes. Most of the clay seal impressions found were still undeciphered and untranslated in their time.\nIn the opinion of Sainte Fare Garnot (1956) and te Velde (1956), the name of \"Peribsen\" accords religious meaning, even before association with a deity. \nThe name \"Peribsen\" literally means \"He who comes forth by their will\" or \"His heart and will comes forth for them.\"\nThe Egyptian syllable \"sn\" means \"them, their, those\", revealing a clear plural writing. \nTe Velde and Garnot are convinced that Peribsen used the heraldic Seth animal as a serekh patron, but also linked his name to Horus. If true, it would prove that Peribsen worshipped Horus and Seth on an equal footing during his lifetime. \nAn ostentatious plural meaning with religious ambiguity was not uncommon for pharaohs' names in the early Egyptian dynasties. Peribsen may have been perceived as a living incarnation of both Horus and Seth in equal measure, just like his predecessors on the throne. Therefore, Peribsen's name may actually show no break in the sacred tradition; he added the power of Seth to Horus. As further examples, the titles of early dynastic queens used plural patron deities, such as \"she who is allowed to see Horus and Seth\" and \"she who carries Horus and Seth\". Similarly, the unusual serekh of king Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the Second Dynasty, shows the deities Horus and Seth together atop the serekh. Horus wears the White Crown of Upper Egypt and Seth wears the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. The two gods are depicted facing each other in a kissing gesture. This special name was meant to illustrate the dual incarnation of the king as the representative of Horus and Seth, with power over all Egypt. Khasekhemwy's name can be interpreted as an advanced form of Peribsen's serekh name.\n\nEgyptologists Ludwig David Morenz and Wolfgang Helck remark that the targeted gouging of Seth-animals did not occur until the New Kingdom of Egypt. The erasure of the Seth chimera on Peribsen's tomb stelae had been attributed to activity shortly after his death under the \"heretic\" theory; new discoveries suggested the defamation occurred centuries later. Historian Dietrich Wildung states that the necropolis of Abydos was not the only one plundered in antiquity: the tombs at Saqqara and Giza were also ransacked. Thus, he concludes that any targeted action against one particular pharaoh can be excluded.\n\nThe earlier theories of Newberry, Černý and Grdseloff said that the Egyptian state under Peribsen suffered from several civil wars, either economic or political in origin. If he was held responsible for the putative misery in the past, this could explain why later king lists excluded Peribsen.\n\nIn contrast, more recent theories now hold that, if the Egyptian kingdom was divided, the division happened peacefully. Egyptologists such as Michael Rice, Francesco Tiradritti and Wolfgang Helck point to the once palatial and well preserved mastaba tombs at Saqqara and Abydos belonging to high officials such as Ruaben and Nefer-Setekh. These are all dated from the reign of Nynetjer to that of Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the Second Dynasty. Egyptologists consider the archaeological record of the mastabas' condition and the original architecture as proof that the statewide mortuary cults for kings and noblemen operated successfully during the entire dynasty. If true, their preservation is inconsistent with the theory of civil wars and economic problems during Peribsen's reign. Rice, Tiradritti and Helck think that Nynetjer decided to leave a divided realm because of private or political reasons and that the split was a formality sustained by Second Dynasty kings.\n\nThe origin of the political division is unknown. It might have happened at the beginning of Peribsen's rule or shortly before. Because Peribsen chose the deity Seth as his new throne patron, Egyptologists are of the view that Peribsen was a chieftain from Thinis or a prince of the Thinite royal house. This theory is based on Seth being a deity of Thinite origin, which would explain Peribsen's choice: his name changing may have been nothing more than smart political (and religious) propaganda. Peribsen is thought to have gained the Thinite throne and ruled only Upper Egypt, whilst other rulers held the Memphite throne and ruled Lower Egypt.\n\nEgyptologists Walter Bryan Emery, Kathryn A. Bard and Flinders Petrie believe that Peribsen was also known as Sekhemib-Perenmaat, another Second Dynasty ruler that had connected his name with the falcon god Horus. As evidence, clay seals of Sekhemib found in the entrance of Peribsen's tomb support this hypothesis. Sekhemib's tomb has not yet been found.\n\nThis theory is debatable; Hermann Alexander Schlögl, Wolfgang Helck, Peter Kaplony and Jochem Kahl argue that the clay seals were only found at the entrance area of Peribsen's tomb and none of them depict Peribsen and Sekhemib's names together in one inscription. Furthermore, they remark that it was customary for a pharaoh to bury his predecessor and seal his tomb; the presence of Sekhemib's seals shows the line of dynastic inheritance. Similar inferences can be drawn from the ivory tablets of king Hotepsekhemwy found at the entrance of king Qa'a's tomb and the clay seals of Djoser found at the entrance of Khasekhemwy's tomb. Schlögl, Helck, Kaplony and Kahl are convinced that the discovery of Sekhemib's seals support the view that Sekhemib immediately succeeded Peribsen and buried him.\n\nScholars Toby Wilkinson and Helck believe that Peribsen and Sekhemib could have been related. Their theory is based on the stone vessel inscriptions and seal impressions that show strong similarities in their typography and grammar. The vessels of Peribsen show the notation \"ini-setjet\" (\"tribute of the people of Sethroë\"), whilst Sekhemib's inscriptions have the notation \"ini-khasut\" (\"tribute of the desert nomads\"). A further indication that Peribsen and Sekhemib were related is their serekh names; they both used the syllables \"Per\" and \"ib\" in their names.\n\nThe false door inscription of Shery might indicate that Peribsen is identical with king Senedj (\"Senedj\" means \"the frightening\") and that this name was used in the king lists by proxy, as the Seth name was forbidden to mention. In contrast, Dietrich Wildung and Wolfgang Helck identify Peribsen with the Ramesside cartouche name \"Wadjenes\". They think it is possible that the name \"Per-ib-sen\" was misread from a sloppy hieratic inscription of \"Wadj-sen\".\n\nAs some archaeological records support the view that the Egyptian state was divided during Peribsen's reign, there is continued debate as to why his predecessors decided to divide the realm, and whether Peribsen ruled part or all of Egypt.\n\nEgyptologists Wolfgang Helck, Nicolas Grimal, Hermann Alexander Schlögl and Francesco Tiradritti believe that king Nynetjer, the third ruler of the Second dynasty and predecessor to Peribsen, ruled an Egypt that was suffering from an overly complex state administration. Nynetjer decided to split Egypt to leave it to two chosen successors who would rule two separate kingdoms, in the hope that the state administration could improve. Archaeological evidence, such as the imprinted clay seals and inscribed jars, appear to support the claim that Peribsen ruled only in Upper Egypt. A great number of these were found in Abydos, Naqada and at Elephantine, with only a single clay seal bearing his name found in Lower Egypt, at Beit Khallaf. Historians think Peribsen's realm would have extended from Naqada to the Isle of Elephantine. The rest of Egypt would therefore have been controlled by a different, coexisting ruler.\n\nEgyptologist Dimitri B. Proussakov supports his theory with notations on the famous Palermo stone concerning the year events of king Nynetjer. From the twelfth year event onward, \"The king of Upper- and Lower Egypt appears\" was amended to \"The king of Lower Egypt appears\". Proussakov sees this as a strong indication that Nynetjer's power over Egypt had diminished. Egyptologists compare the situation to that of king Qa'a, one of the last rulers of the First Dynasty. When Qa'a died, obscure claimants appeared and battled for the throne of Egypt. The struggles reached an apex with the plundering of the royal cemetery at Abydos, whereupon the cemetery was abandoned and Saqqara became the new royal burial site. The conflict was ended by the ascension of king Hotepsekhemwy, the founder of the Second Dynasty.\n\nBarbara Bell, another scholar, believes that an economic catastrophe such as a famine or a long-lasting drought affected Egypt. To better address the problem of feeding the Egyptian population, Nynetjer split the realm into two and his successors founded two independent realms, perhaps with intent to reunite after the famine. Bell points to the inscriptions of the Palermo stone, where, in her opinion, the records of the annual Nile floods show constantly low levels during this period. Bell's theory is refuted today by Egyptologists such as Stephan Seidlmayer, who asserts her calculations were incorrect. Seidlmayer has shown that the annual Nile floods were at usual levels at Nynetjer's time up to the period of the Old Kingdom. Bell overlooked that the heights of the Nile floods in the Palermo stone inscription take into account the measurements of the nilometers around Memphis, but not elsewhere along the river. A state-wide drought was unlikely.\n\n\nEgyptian historians such as Helck, Tiradritti, Schlögl, Emery and Grimal are convinced that Peribsen was a co-ruler. The investigation into the rulers of Lower Egypt is ongoing. The Rammesside king lists differ in their order of royal names from king Senedj onward. The royal table of Sakkara and the royal canon of Turin reflect Memphite traditions, which only allowed Memphite rulers to be mentioned. The Abydos king list reflects instead the Thinite traditions and therefore only Thinite rulers appear on that list. Until king Senedj, all the king lists are in agreement. After him, the Sakkara list and the Turin list mention three kings as successors: Neferkara I, Neferkasokar and Hudjefa I. The Abydos king list jumps forward to Khasekhemwy, calling him \"Djadjay\". The discrepancies are considered by Egyptologists to be the result of the division of Egypt during the Second dynasty.\n\nAdditional contradictory findings are the Horus and Nebty names of kings discovered in the Great Southern Gallery in the necropolis of the (Third dynasty) king Djoser at Sakkara. Stone vessel inscriptions mention the kings Nubnefer, Weneg-Nebty, Horus Ba, Horus \"Bird\" and Za; each of these is mentioned only a few times, suggesting their reigns were short. King Sneferka might be identical with king Qa'a or an ephemeral successor of his. King Weneg-Nebty might be identical with the Ramesside cartouche name Wadjenes. But kings such as \"Nubnefer\", \"Bird\" and \"Za\" remain a mystery. They never appear anywhere else and the number of objects surviving from their lifetimes is very limited. Schlögl, Helck and Peter Kaplony postulate, that Nubnefer, Za and Bird were contemporaries of Peribsen and Sekhemib and ruled over Lower Egypt, whilst the latter two ruled Upper Egypt.\n\nScholars such as Herman TeVelde, I. E. S. Edwards and Toby Wilkinson believe the inscription of the famous \"Annal stone of Fifth dynasty\", a black olivin-basalt slabstone displaying a very detailed king list, argues against the division of the realm. On the stone the kings from 1st to 7th dynasty are listed by their Horus name, their gold name and their cartouche name, their name banderoles end with the name of their royal mother. The lists also contain rectangular windows presenting year events from the day of king's coronation up to his death. The most famous fragments of the Annal stone are called \"Palermo Stone\" and \"Cairo Stone\". On the Cairo stone, in line IV, the nine last years of king Nynetjer are preserved (but most of the year windows are illegible now). The date of Nynetjer's death is followed by a new king. Recent investigations reveal that the serekh of that new king is surmounted by a four-legged animal, not by the Horus-falcon. Since the only four-legged heraldic serekh animal in early Egypt was the chimera of the god Seth, despite passionate disagreement, the indicated ruler is likely to be Peribsen. Egyptologists such as TeVelde, Barta and Edwards do not agree; Peribsen might have not been the only king with a Seth-name. The year events under Nynetjer show increasing references to Seth, suggesting the tradition of a Horus name as the sole name of kings might have already evolved. The rise of a king allied with Seth was thus unsurprising. TeVelde, Barta and Edwards think that, in addition to Peribsen, the rulers \"Wadjenes\", \"Nubnefer\" or \"Sened\" might have been Seth-kings as well; one of them surely was the true direct successor of Nynetjer. The comparatively large amount of archaeological finds from Peribsen's reign contradict the brief estimated length of rulership, only 10 to 12 years, as presented on the Annal stone.\n\nThe Annal stone gives absolutely no indication of a division of the Egyptian realm. Barta, TeVelde, Wilkinson and Edwards argue that the theory of state division is untenable. An administrative reorganization or split in the priesthood sects is more likely.\n\nDuring his time on the throne, Peribsen founded an administrative center called \"The white house of treasury\" as well as a new royal residence, called the \"protection of Nubt\", located near Ombos (\"Nubt\" being the Ancient Egyptian name of Naqada). The administrative titles of scribes, seal-bearers and overseers were adjusted to correspond to the divided bureaucratic state administration. For example, titles like \"sealer of the king\" were changed into \"sealer of the king of Upper Egypt\". This bureaucratic reform may indicate an attempt by Peribsen to limit the power of these officials, further evidence for a bloated and unwieldy state administration under Nynetjer.\n\nThe administration system under Peribsen and Sekhemib had a clear and well-defined hierarchy; as an example, from highest to the lowest rank: Treasury house (royal and therefore highest in ranking) → pension office → property → vineyards → private vineyard (property of citizens and therefore lowest in ranking). King Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the Second dynasty, was able to re-unify the state administration of Egypt and therefore unite the whole of Ancient Egypt. He brought the two treasury houses of Egypt under the control of the \"House of the King\", bringing them into a new, single administration centre.\n\nPeribsen also founded royal edifices such as \"Per-nubt\" (\"house of Ombos\") and \"Per-Medjed\" (\"house of meetings\") and created several cities of economic importance. Their names, \"Afnut\" (\"city of the headdress-makers\"), \"Nebj\" (\"protector's city\"), \"Abet-desheret\" (\"city of the red granite jars\") and \"Huj-setjet\" (\"city of the Asians'), are mentioned on numerous clay seals alongside Peribsen's serekh, often preceded by the phrase \"visit of the king at ...\". Inscriptions on stone vessels also mention an \"ini-setjet\" (\"tribute of the people of Sethroë\"), which might indicate that Peribsen founded a cult centre for the deity Seth in the Nile Delta. This may suggest Peribsen ruled over the whole of Egypt, or, at least, that he was accepted as king across all of Egypt.\n\nOne official from Peribsen's reign, Nefer-Setekh (\"Seth is beautiful\"), the \"wab-priest of the king\", is known to Egyptologists by his stela. His name may highlight the appearance and popularity of Seth as a royal deity.\n\nIn Peribsen's tomb at Abydos, clay seals were found that demonstrate the first complete written sentence in recorded Egyptian history. The inscription reads: \n\n\"\"The golden one/He of Ombos hath unified/handed over the two realms for/to his son, the king of Lower and Upper Egypt, Peribsen\"\".\nThe title \"\"The golden one\"\", also read as \"\"He of Ombos\"\", is considered by Egyptologists to be a religious form of address to the deity Seth.\n\nDespite his alignment with Seth, numerous deities were worshipped by the populace under Peribsen. Numerous clay seal impressions and jar inscriptions mention the gods Ash, Horus, Nekhbet, Min, Bastet and Kherty. The depictions of the deities are followed by the name of the place or town where they had their principal cult center. On the Cairo stone, a statue of Ash and a fetish of Seth are credited to Peribsen, complementing the clay seal impressions. Curiously, several seal impressions show a sun disc over the Seth chimera atop the royal serekh: the ancient symbol for the god Ra. There is no archaeologic proof that the sun god Ra was part of the Egyptian pantheon at this early date; the appearance of the disc may be the first evidence of the evolving sun cult and theistic change. The sun disc appears in connection to one of the state patrons (for example, under Peribsen's predecessor Raneb the sun was connected to Horus); under Peribsen it was connected to Seth. Under king Khasekhemwy the sun finally received its own name (\"ra\") and, at the time of throne change between Khasekhemwy and his follower Djoser, several priests and officials also connected their name to Ra.\n\nPeribsen was buried in the tomb P of the royal cemetery at Umm el-Qa'ab near Abydos. The first excavation of the tomb started in 1898 under the supervision of French archaeologist and Egyptologist Émile Amélineau. This first foray was followed by excavations in 1901 and 1902 under the supervision of British archaeologist Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie. Further exploration of the tomb was undertaken in 1928 by the Swiss Egyptologist Edouard Naville.\n\nThe tomb's construction is straightforward and, compared to the size of other royal tombs in the same area, surprisingly small. The design model was the tomb of king Djer (third pharaoh of the First dynasty), thought to be the 'Tomb of Osiris' from the Middle Kingdom. The architecture of Peribsen's tomb is similar to the residential palace. The tomb measures x and comprises three independent structures nested into one another: in the center is the main burial chamber, measuring x , and which is made of mud bricks, reeds, and wood. On the north, east and west sides the burial chamber is surrounded by nine small storage rooms leading into one another; on the south face is a long antechamber. A passageway runs between the inner structures and the outer wall.\n\nExcavations under the supervision of the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut Kairo (DAIK) in 2001 and 2004 revealed that the tomb had been erected and completed in a great hurry. The building works took place in a single phase; the walls were plastered roughly; and the monument had collapsed several times over the centuries. During the Middle Kingdom, Peribsen's tomb was restored at least twice together with the tomb of Djer, which was thought to be that of Osiris.\n\nThe tomb had been extensively plundered by tomb robbers during antiquity, yet numerous stone vessels and earthen jars remained. Some of the stone vessels had copper-coated rims and are similar to the better known finds from tomb of Khasekhemwy. Vessels from preceding rulers such as Nynetjer and Raneb were also found. Beads and bracelets made of fayence and carnelian and tools made of copper were excavated. Special findings include a silver needle engraved with the name of king Hor Aha and clay seal fragments with the name of king Sekhemib. The two stone stelae from the entrance, common to burial chambers of the First and Second dynasties, are now on display in two different museums.\n\nA royal funerary enclosure made of mud bricks was found close to Peribsen's tomb. Clay seals with Peribsen's serekh name on them were located near the eastern entrance and inside a destroyed offering shrine. The findings support the view that the building was part of Peribsen's burial site. The funerary enclosure is commonly known as \"Middle Fort\". This was first discovered in 1904 under the supervision of Canadian archaeologist Charles Trick Currelly and British Egyptologist Edward Russell Ayrton. The enclosure wall was located on the north-west side of Khasekhemwy's funerary enclosure \"Shunet ez Zebib\" (\"raisin barn\"). Peribsen's measures x and housed only a few cult buildings. The enclosure has three entrances: one to the east, one to the south and one to the north. A small shrine, measuring x was located at the south-east corner of the funerary enclosure. It once comprised three small chapels. No subsidiary tombs were found.\n\nThe tradition of burying the family and court of the king when he died was abandoned at the time of Qa'a, one of the last rulers of the First dynasty.\n\n"}

Agron mistook both teenagers for members of a gang called the Norsemen who were supposed to show up for a gang fight. Agron was the subject of the musical \"The Capeman\" by Paul Simon.\n\nAgron was born in the city of Mayagüez on the western coast of Puerto Rico. When he was young, his parents divorced and his mother had custody of him and his sister, Aurea. She earned a living by working at a local convent; however, according to Agron, he and his sister were mistreated by the nuns. His mother met and married a Pentecostal minister and the family moved to New York City. Agron's relationship with his stepfather was negative, and he asked his mother to send him back to Puerto Rico to live with his father. In Puerto Rico, his father had remarried. One day the teenage Agron found the body of his stepmother, who had committed suicide by hanging herself. Agron began to get into trouble and was sent to the Industrial School of Mayagüez.\n\nHis father sent him back to his mother in New York, and in 1958 he became a member of notorious teenage street gang the Mau Maus from the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn. He later joined another gang called the Vampires after meeting Tony Hernandez, the gang's president. On August 29, 1959, the Vampires were on their way to \"rumble\" (street gang fight) with a gang composed mostly of Irish Americans called the Norsemen. When they arrived, they mistook a group of teenagers for members of the Norsemen. Agron stabbed two of the teenagers to death and fled the scene. The two victims were Anthony Krzesinski and Robert Young, Jr.\n\nThe murders made headlines in New York and the city went into an uproar. Agron was called \"The Capeman\" because he wore a black cape with red lining during the fight, while Hernandez was labeled \"The Umbrella Man\" because he used an umbrella with a sharp end as a weapon. After Agron was captured, he was quoted as saying: \"I don't care if I burn, my mother could watch me.\"\n\nAgron was sentenced to death, which made the 16-year-old the youngest prisoner ever sentenced to death row in New York. While many New Yorkers were outraged about the killings, others like former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and Robert Young, the father of one of the victims, campaigned for leniency. While on death row, Agron became a born-again Christian. In prison he learned to read and write, earning his high school equivalency diploma. He wrote poems about his life and street life, including \"The Political Identity of Salvador Agron; Travel Log of Thirty-Four Years\", \"Uhuru Sasa! (A Freedom Call)\", and \"Justice, Law and Order\", which were published by some newspapers. He later earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology and philosophy from the State University of New York in New Paltz, New York. His death sentence was commuted to life in prison by Governor Nelson Rockefeller in 1962.\n\nIn December 1976, Governor Hugh Carey reduced Agron's sentence, making him eligible for release in 1977. Agron was enrolled at SUNY New Paltz while spending his nights at the Fishkill Correctional Facility.

The officer was responding to a report of drug trafficking when she pulled over a dark Chevrolet Suburban carrying Rocha and two others.\n\nAccording to officers reports, soon after being pulled over near the intersection of South Pleasant Valley Road and Quicksilver Boulevard, a scuffle between Rocha and Officer Julie Schroeder took place.\n\nIt was during this time when Schroeder shot Rocha in the back at point blank range. Schroder's testimony was that she used lethal force to protect both officer Sgt. Don Doyle and herself from a taser gun, which, she argued, Rocha could have used. Witnesses at the scene say that he was on the ground face down, unarmed, with Officer Schroeder's knee in his back when he was shot at point blank range.\n\nAustin Police Department Policy provides that cameras in patrol cars be on during traffic stops. Three police cars participated in the stop, yet two of the three available cameras were not on during the incident and the third arrived after Rocha was shot.\n\nMultiple tests were conducted on Rocha to determine whether narcotics were in his blood the night he was killed. Rocha was initially reported drug-free by Travis County Medical Examiner Robert Bayardo. On July 18, 2005 Bayardo reversed this position, stating investigators found traces of marijuana in a \"subsequent toxicology screen\". This reversal resulted in criticism against the findings from some members of the community.\n\nJulie Schroeder was fired from the Austin Police Department for violating multiple department policies during the incident, including her failure to use in-car recording equipment and improper use and handling of taser weapons. Schroeder's use of deadly force was found to be inappropriate. Stan Knee—chief of the Austin Police Department—stated \"this was a deadly force encounter that, in my opinion, was avoidable\". \n\nIn June 2005, the city of Austin agreed to a $1million settlement in a lawsuit related to the death of Daniel Rocha.\n"}

The soft count rooms are usually among the most secure places due to the large amounts of cash that can be on hand at any one time.\n\nTraditionally, a count room would be operated by at least three people. The first two people independently counted stacks of currency and recorded the results on a count card. The third person examined the two count cards to ensure that the first two people recorded the same amount. If there was a difference between the amounts recorded on the two count cards, the currency would be recounted. Some smaller volume cash businesses still operate a count room in this fashion.\n\nThe counting is currently done by accounting professionals called soft counters, usually using computer spreadsheets. \n\nTypically, a soft count room contains a large table upon which the currency to be counted is placed, known as the \"count table\". Count room personnel manually organize the currency so that it can be easily counted by hand or by a counting machine.\n\nMost modern count rooms are equipped with high-speed computerized machines that perform the counting process. Typically, these machines are capable of counting between ten and twenty banknotes per second. After currency is prepared on the count table, it is transferred to the machine's operator, who inserts the prepared stacks into the machine. The machine authenticates each banknote, separates the counted banknotes according to denomination, and provides a printed or electronic report of the results.\n\nThe opposite of soft count is hard count in which coins and chips are counted.\n"}

Pal Mickey was discontinued and no new stock is available for purchase as of October 2008.\n\nThe toy is a ten-inch (26.5 cm) plush model of Mickey Mouse, soft and easy for children to hold. Inside, it contains a microprocessor, a speaker, three AA batteries, three squeeze sensors (one in each hand and one in its belly), and an infrared receiver in its nose. A loop on the back of its head fits a clip or a lanyard hook for ease of carrying.\n\nPal Mickey was sold for use at the four theme parks at Walt Disney World Resort: the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and Disney's Animal Kingdom. Guests could previously purchase Pal Mickey at various on site hotel gift shops, all four theme parks, and Downtown Disney. It communicates invisibly with more than four hundred infrared transmitters around these parks. It will periodically giggle and vibrate to indicate that it has information to provide; when its belly or hand is squeezed, it will speak up with information about the immediate area, parade and showtime reminders, tips on what costumed walkaround characters may be nearby, and attractions with short queue times. It \"remembers\" where it has been so as to avoid repeating itself.\n\nIf it is squeezed when it has no tips to provide or when it is not at a park, it will tell jokes and play simple games. The toy is programmed with over seven hundred pre-recorded phrases. In September 2014, Disney ceased supporting Pal Mickey at the parks. As of July 2017 Pal Mickey continues to automatically provide information about its immediate area, but no longer provides updates on character meet and greets or parade and showtime reminders.\n\nThe original version of Pal Mickey (commonly referred to as \"1.0\") was introduced in May 2003. It was dressed in red shorts with white buttons, white gloves, and yellow shoes. It sold for US$50, with rentals available for $8 per day plus a $50 deposit to return it by noon the following day; if not returned, that deposit was forfeited and the toy was considered sold. This version of the toy came with a clip. The rental program was discontinued at the end of 2004.\n\nThe \"Happiest Celebration On Earth\" version of the toy (commonly referred to as \"2.0\") was introduced on May 5, 2005 with the start of the Happiest Celebration on Earth events. It is priced at US$65. It is dressed in red shorts with gold buttons, white gloves, and yellow shoes; it wears a tailcoat and a gold bowtie, both of which fasten with velcro. It comes with a clip and a lanyard for carrying it. This version improves on the original in many small ways, such as by having a louder speaker, and it is able to sing Disney songs and ask Disney character trivia questions. Permanently attached to its right hand is a golden medallion; squeezing its right hand will make Mickey giggle and will make a \"Happiest Celebration on Earth Glow Medallion\" (sold during 2005) light up.\n\nIn September 2006, the \"Pal Mickey Sorcerer Costume\" (commonly referred to as \"3.0\") replaced the previous version of the toy. This Pal Mickey is dressed in a (removable) blue Sorcerer Mickey hat, red robe, and blue shorts (sewn on over Mickey's red shorts, which have white buttons like the first release). It does not have the medallion on its hand.\n\nA Spanish language version of Pal Mickey was also available.\n\nFour costumes for the toy were made available in early 2006. The costumes are \"Mickey Mouse Club\", \"Pin Trading\", \"Safari\", and \"Rain Wear\", and sell for US$10 each. In October 2006, \"Pirate Cap'n\" and \"Santa Mickey\" costumes were made available for US$12 each. The \"Santa Mickey\" sold out during December 2006 and was not available for order through the WDW Mail Order department. However, it returned for the 2007 Holiday season.\n\nThe toy was discontinued in fall 2008. The toy continued to work until September 2014. At that point Disney stopped servicing the infrared technology to focus more on their RFID technology used in their magic bands.\n\nThe original version of the toy provided a choice of three games, triggered by squeezing both of its hands at the same time.\n\n\nThese games are added in the \"Happiest Celebration on Earth\" and later versions of the toy, for a total of six games. The above three games are triggered by squeezing the toy's tummy and right hand at the same time; the below three games are triggered by squeezing its tummy and left hand at the same time.\n\n\nPal Mickey's electronics and batteries are encased in plastic housings (the original version's housing is black or white, the second version's is yellow, and the third version's is white) which can be accessed by unzipping the back of the toy. Beneath the zipper is an on/off switch which enables or disables the toy's squeeze and infrared sensors to prolong battery life.\n\nThe toys are shipped with batteries installed, and they are set to \"demo mode\" while they are on store shelves: they ignore infrared signals, and squeezing them will make them recite a sample of tips as if they were near park attractions.\n\nIt has been reported that the infrared transmitters in the parks are able to identify individual Pal Mickey toys and roughly track their locations as they are carried around, thereby letting Disney collect information about guests' progress through the parks. If this is true, the information collected would be anonymous, since nothing identifies a specific Pal Mickey as belonging to a specific person or family. However this is very useful as it shows a general pattern for families, who are Disney's main target audience. Most guest with a Pal Mickey are likely to have children, therefore this shows what attractions are and aren't popular with younger visitors. Nothing has been said about whether they will expand this idea to the other Disney Resorts.\n\n"}

It was released by Heavenly Records. In an interview with \"Record Collector\", band member Bob Stanley stated that the title is a reference to the 1959 film \"Tiger Bay\".\n\nThe album is described by Bob Stanley as \"an album of modern folk songs done in twentieth century styles like techno and dub\". \"Like a Motorway\", for example, blends Kraftwerk-style techno with the melody from the nineteenth century folk song \"Silver Dagger\". Some of the songs, such as \"Marble Lions\" and \"Former Lover\" forsake electronics for classical folk instrumentation and orchestral arrangements. One, \"Western Wind\", is a traditional English folk song.\n\nThe band wrote most of the songs in the Forest of Dean, in the hope that the countryside would inspire folk ideas. The original intention was for all the songs to be about death.\n\n\"Tiger Bay\" was released in the UK in June 1994. The original cover art is James Clarke Hook's \"Welcome Bonny Boat\", doctored to include the band members.\n\nThe American edition of the album replaced the UK cover art with a photograph of the band smartly dressed at a table. It does not include the \"Western Wind\"/\"Tankerville\" suite. In place of the cut songs is the single \"I Was Born On Christmas Day\" and remixes by Daniel Abraham of \"Hug My Soul\" and \"Like a Motorway\".\n\n\"Tiger Bay\" was reissued in 1996 by Creation Records, in part because of Saint Etienne's absence from the music scene, but also because of their formal move to Creation Records. The reissue featured another new cover, this time showing Giuditta del Vecchio (from the film \"Léolo\"); the back shows a picture of the group. The inner sleeve was updated, and includes a short commentary on the album by journalist and friend of the group Simon Price, as well as a new selection of photographs with a summery theme. The album itself features a slightly shuffled track listing. \"Marble Lions\" is moved to appear after \"Pale Movie\". The second occurrence of \"Western Wind\" is removed completely; instead \"Tankerville\" fades into \"Boy Scouts of America\". \"Former Lover\" is also edited, although less noticeably, with only the opening guitar chords being removed. The reissue also features four extra tracks – \"I Buy American Records\", \"Grovely Road\", \"Hate your Drug\" and the single edit of \"He's on the Phone\".\n\nIn 2010 the album was re-released once more. The new deluxe version reinstates the original sleeve art and includes a booklet with an interview with Bob Stanley and additional bonus disc containing a number of demos and all of the b-sides.\n\nThe British release of \"Tiger Bay\" was commercially successful and reached #8 on the UK Album Chart. Three singles were released, but none matched the popularity of those from their previous album. The first, \"Pale Movie\", peaked at No. 28. \"Like a Motorway\" was more disappointing, missing the top forty completely and making only No. 47. \"Hug My Soul\" was released as a two-disc set and managed better, peaking at No. 32.\n\n\"Hug My Soul\" was the only single that charted in the US and reached No. 40 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play chart.\n\nIn a 2009 interview, Bob Stanley said that in retrospect the band should have included some more obvious singles on \"Tiger Bay\", to be commercial: \"it definitely could have done with a couple more obvious songs\". He also acknowledged that the original cover was a commercial mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was first released on 28 September 2005 in Japan, and later on 3 October in the UK, through the Domino Recording Company. Recorded in both New York City and their own studio in Glasgow with producer Rich Costey, the album spawned four UK top 30 singles: \"Do You Want To\", \"The Fallen\", \"Walk Away\" and \"Eleanor Put Your Boots On.\"\n\nThe album became the band's first UK number-one album, and although their debut album was relatively successful in the United States, going platinum and reaching number 32, \"You Could Have It So Much Better\" managed to reach number 8 and earn gold status in the United States. The cover design is modeled on Alexander Rodchenko's 1924 portrait of Lilya Brik. It was produced by Rich Costey and Franz Ferdinand.\n\nInitially it was reported that the album would simply be eponymous like the debut album, 2004's \"Franz Ferdinand\". Singer Alex Kapranos explained, \"The whole point is that the album doesn’t have a title. We decided quite a while ago that we didn’t want to give any of the albums titles, they were just going to be called 'Franz Ferdinand'.\"\n\nHe added, \"The albums are going to be identified by their colour schemes rather than a title. The contrast of different colours creates a different mood. We experimented with different combinations of colours and this one stuck. At one level they looked good together, and they capture the mood of this record quite well.\"\n\nHowever, on 1 August it was revealed that the band had changed their minds and decided to give the album a name. First, they revealed that the title \"Outsiders\" was considered before the current title was decided upon.\n\nAs drummer Paul Thomson explained, \"I was thinking something similar, but that 'You Could Have It So Much Better' would have been even greater. We talked about how we liked that idea a lot and that it was a real shame that the album wasn't going to have a title. Then we started laughing when we realized that the album hadn't been manufactured yet and we could change it after all.\" The title was also initially reported as the lengthy \"You Could Have It So Much Better... With Franz Ferdinand\". The album's cover art is inspired by the works of Alexander Rodchenko, the Russian avant-garde photographer and collage pioneer. In particular, the cover image is a direct copy of Rodchenko's of Lilya Brik.\n\nThe song \"You're the Reason I'm Leaving\" is believed to be a dual-meaning track; it can be read as a typical relationship-centered song, but also as being a lighthearted political commentary on the rivalry between former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and former UK Prime Minister (then-Chancellor of the Exchequer) Gordon Brown. The song contains the lyric: \"I'd no idea that in four years I'd be hanging from a beam behind the door of number ten, singing \"fare thee well, I am leaving, yes I leave it all to you\"\". \"Number ten\" here refers to 10 Downing Street, the address of the UK Prime Minister. Four years was the typical length of a parliament before five-year fixed term legislation was passed in 2011.\n\nThe album was the first chart topping album for both the band and their label, Domino Recording Company, in the UK. In the weeks after being released, the album fell first to number 5, then number 9, number 15, and number 24, before resting at number 40 in the charts. On 25 December 2005, the album had risen to number 37 in the charts. A week later, on 1 January 2006, the album had risen again to number 24 in the UK Albums Chart, but fell two spots to number 26 the following week before rising again to number 23 on 15 January. A week later, the album had fallen again to number 26. On 29 January, the album had fallen a further six spots to number 32. The album fell out of the top 40 altogether the week of 5 February.\n\nEntering and peaking at number 8, the album has sold 378,000 units in the United States , somewhat below the sales success of the band's 2004 debut, although it was certified gold.\n\n\"You Could Have It So Much Better\" received universal acclaim from music critics, with a score of 83 out of 100 on Metacritic. Nitsuh Abebe of \"Pitchfork\" complimented the band on returning with a \"big ridiculous stomper, a song whose hooks get so happily ballroom-glam you'd almost think they stole them from the Sweet or the Bay City Rollers–the kind of song most bands wouldn't be able to pull off without telegraphing a whole lot of irony and embarrassment\". Will Hermes of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote that the album \"shows Franz Ferdinand working harder and sounding bigger, befitting their stature as rock's saviors of the moment\", while David Fricke of \"Rolling Stone\" noted that the album \"shows deeper roots in the first wave of white electric dance music: specifically the crunchy-guitar R&B and arch-garage songwriting of 1965–1967 Kinks\". \"Spin\"s Andrew Beaujon stated that it \"sounds exactly like what you'd expect, with pumping disco beats and lookin'-sharp guitars on track after propulsive track\", and the magazine later ranked it the third best album of 2005 and called it \"so much better than its predecessor\" thanks to Kapranos' \"dubious sensitivity\".\n\n\n"}

Prior to his appointment to the Roman Curia, he held several diocesan bishop positions in the Philippines, the last of which was Archbishop of Nueva Segovia from 1982–1986. He was ordained a priest on May 12, 1946. He was consecrated bishop on May 12, 1968, following his appointment as Auxiliary Bishop of Nueva Cáceres, and was elevated to cardinal on June 28, 1991, by Pope John Paul II.\n\nSánchez was born in Pandan town in the island-province of Catanduanes.

Sanchez was ordained on May 12, 1946, as a priest from Sorsogon, where he was asked to teach at the Peñafrancia Seminary. According to him, he taught Latin, Spanish and, because no one else could ably teach the subjects, Geometry and Algebra.

He was elevated to Cardinal-Priest after 10 years on February 26, 2002.\n\nSánchez returned to the Philippines in December 2010, ostensibly to fight the Reproductive Health Bill, which he believed will destroy the Filipino family due to the promotion of extramarital sex and premarital sex that comes with the distribution of contraceptives.\n\n\"His constant prayer was that Europe’s loss of its Christian faith would never happen in the Philippines,\" wrote former Senator Francisco Tatad. \"And he would contribute his last strength to the fight of the Filipino family against the international reproductive health lobby, which has destroyed the family and killed the Christian faith in many parts of the world.\"\n\nCardinal Sánchez died on March 9, 2012, at the age of 91 due to multiple organ failure and 8 days before his 92nd birthday, making him the Philippines' longest living Cardinal. \n\n\n \n"}

He is best known for playing Dr. Donald Westphall in the medical drama series \"St. Elsewhere\" (1982–1988). Flanders was nominated for eight Primetime Emmys and won three times in 1976, 1977, and 1983.\n\nHe received a Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award for his performance in the 1973 production of \"A Moon for the Misbegotten\".\n\nFlanders was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Bernice (née Brown) and Francis Michael Grey Flanders. His mother was killed in an automobile accident when he was 14. After graduating from Patrick Henry High School (where he played hockey) in 1952, he enlisted in the United States Army, where he served as an X-ray technician.\n\nAfter his service with the United States Army ended, Flanders began his acting career on Broadway before moving on to guest parts in television series. From 1967 through 1975, Flanders appeared in more than a dozen American TV shows, including six appearances on \"Hawaii Five-O\" (as six different characters). During this time, he was also prolific in TV movies. He married actress Ellen Geer, with whom he had a son, Ian Flanders (born 1966) before they divorced.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Flanders moved away from small TV roles to take major credits in both TV and feature films, while continuing his stage career. In 1974, Flanders won a Tony Award for Best Supporting or Featured Actor in a Dramatic Presentation for \"A Moon for the Misbegotten\" by Eugene O'Neill on Broadway. He also won an Emmy award in 1976 for the TV movie adaptation of \"A Moon for the Misbegotten\".\n\nIn 1982, he began his role in \"St. Elsewhere\" that earned him four Emmy Award nominations as Outstanding Lead Actor in a TV Series, winning the award in 1983. After a stormy departure from the series in 1987, he returned for two more episodes in 1988, including the series finale. During a scene in which Westphall addressed the staff, Flanders began speaking extemporaneously about the quality of art and had to be edited for broadcast. His exit on \"St. Elsewhere\" as a regular cast member was titled \"Moon for the Misbegotten\" after the play that won him a Tony Award. The episode gained much publicity as Westphall left the hospital after \"mooning\" his new boss, Dr. John Gideon (played by Ronny Cox). Flanders continued his working relationship with executive producer Bruce Paltrow in the short-lived 1994 CBS series \"The Road Home\".\n\nIn addition to his six-year role as Dr. Donald Westphall, Flanders is noted as the actor who has played President Harry Truman more times, and in more separate productions, than any other. He portrayed Truman at the end of World War II and during the Korean War in \"Truman at Potsdam\", \"Harry S Truman: Plain Speaking\", and \"MacArthur\". In the last, Flanders had second billing to Gregory Peck's lead as General Douglas MacArthur.\n\nAlong with Jason Robards, Robin Williams and Anthony Hopkins, Flanders is on a short list of actors who have portrayed two U.S. presidents having also portrayed Calvin Coolidge in the television miniseries \"Backstairs at the White House\". \n\nIn feature films, Flanders performed major roles in two dark movies based on novels by William Peter Blatty. In the first, \"The Ninth Configuration\" (1980), he plays Col. Richard Fell, a self-effacing medic at a secret U.S. Army psychiatric facility who assists Marine psychiatrist Col. Vincent Kane (Stacy Keach). The film was based on Blatty's darkly satirical novel \"Twinkle, Twinkle, \"Killer\" Kane\". In 1990, Flanders played Father Dyer alongside star George C. Scott in Blatty's \"The Exorcist III\" based on the novel \"Legion\".\n\nOne of Flanders's best-remembered TV guest roles was in the first season \"M*A*S*H\" episode \"Yankee Doodle Doctor\", playing film director Lt. Duane William Bricker, who is making a documentary about M*A*S*H units and visits to the 4077th. After Hawkeye and Trapper sabotage his effort, Bricker abandons the project and leaves. \n\nFlanders also played nationally known journalist William Allen White in the 1977 made-for-TV movie \"Mary White\". This movie was based on the famous eulogy White wrote about his daughter after her death in 1922 due to a blow to the head while riding her horse. He also appeared in the 1979 made-for-TV-horror-miniseries \"Salem's Lot\" as Dr. Bill Norton. He also played news anchor John Woodley in the 1983 made-for-TV suspense drama \"Special Bulletin\", about a group of environmentalists who threaten to detonate a nuclear weapon in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nAfter three divorces, chronic pain from a back injury sustained in automobile accident in 1989, and a lifelong battle with depression, Flanders died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on February 22, 1995, in Denny, California at the age of 60. No suicide note was found, and his remains were cremated.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlanders won the 1974 Tony Award for Best Supporting or Featured Actor in a Dramatic Presentation for his performance in \"A Moon for the Misbegotten\" by Eugene O'Neill, for which he also received the 1974 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance.\n\nNotes\n\n"}

Branches provide programming for children, teens, and adults. The Library also contains an Outreach Department which works with the community, as well as people who cannot visit the library directly. Outreach also promotes the library to communities that are under represented in the library.\n\nVisitors to the Winnipeg Public Library checked out over 4.8 million items in 2018, including e-Books. The library has both adult and children's books in over 30 languages. Select locations provide tutorial rooms for learners to use free of charge.\n\nThe library has DVD and Blu-ray collections, as well as Wi-Fi, at all twenty locations. The library provides access to over 17,000 eBooks and over 450,000 songs. There are over 300 computers available to be booked.\n\nThe library offers a Writer-in-Residence program to assist budding authors and has done so for over 20 years.\n\nThe staff at the library are members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 500.\n\nThe Winnipeg Public Library began as a public service to city residents in 1905.\n\nWinnipeg's first public library was the Carnegie Library (380 William Ave.), opened in 1905. American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie had funded the construction of three public libraries in the city. All the city had to do was to choose suitable locations. The main branch would be located downtown. The Free Press asked their readers in May 1902 where they'd prefer to locate the Carnegie branch. The top responses were: Ellice Ave. at Smith St., former Trinity Hall (Portage and Garry), Central Park, Victoria Park, and Market site of City Hall Square. After the site on William Avenue had been chosen, the architect chosen to design the building was Samuel Hooper. The Carnegie branch had been under construction in 1904 when it was described in a Free Press article as \"most pretentious of our civic buildings…There are not many buildings with an all-[lime]stone exterior. Hitherto, such buildings have been considered too expensive for the city.\" The Library was officially opened in October 12, 1905 by Lady Evelyn, Earl Grey, daughter of the Governor General of Canada.\n\nThe branch was closed after the Centennial Library opened in the spring of1977. It subsequently re-opened as a library for new immigrants wanting to learn English. Later on, it was used to store and provide access to the city's archival records.\n\nIn 2013 while the roof was being repaired, a hole had let water seep inside the building from a heavy rainstorm, damaging a portion of the archive. As at May 2018, the City had not yet decided what to do with the now damaged building — repair it and move the archives back into the building or sell it to a developer. The worst case scenario would have the building demolished for something newer.\n\nTwo potential sites had been considered for a new River Heights branch, budgeted at $70,000, in May of 1958, serving the new and growing subdivision of Winnipeg. The city's Library Committee had preferred the Corydon at Ash St. location next to a football field or by purchasing a property worth $15,000 on Corydon at Niagara, while the Recreation Committee preferred it on Haskins (now Grosvenor) Avenue, next to River Heights School. A large delegation appeared before the city's Recreation Committee on June 18 1958 opposing putting the River Heights Library at the corner of Corydon and Ash. They said it would decrease the amount of space for sports. The next day the Recreation Committee, due to public pressure from the Community Club, voted against the Corydon at Ash site.By April 1960 a firm decision on the site was made. It would be located next to Brock-Corydon elementary school and would now cost $75,000. The new River Heights branch opened to the public on September 1, 1961. The final cost of construction was $77,500. In that month, 1,500 new memberships were created and book circulation in the River Heights area grew to 17,600.\n\nIn July 1968 the City of Winnipeg purchased a new bookmobile for $10,000, because the library committee had stated that the current vehicle was so dilapidated that it might not last till the end of the year.\n\nEarlier in the 2010s, it was determined that the 1961 era River Heights branch had reached \"end of life\". Various locations were sought, one of them at the corner of Nathaniel and Taylor which was not found suitable. Later on the final decision was made to locate the new River Heights branch at the corner of Nathaniel and Grant Avenue and to name it the \"Bill and Helen Norrie Library\". A groundbreaking took place on October 29, 2019.\n\nOn February 7, 1958 the new $60,000 St. James Library opened its doors to the public, at the time the first new library building in Manitoba to be built since the mid-1910s. The Lions Club of St. James contributed a portion of the cost of the new construction. Prior to the new building, the St. James Public Library had been housed in one room of St. James Collegiate (next door) since 1955. The current size of the Library is , making it one of the largest in the WPL system.\n\n\nThe library has branches in 20 locations in Winnipeg:\n\n\n\n"}

The primary goal of life tenure is to insulate the officeholder from external pressures. Certain heads of state, such as monarchs and Presidents for Life, are also given life tenure. United States federal judges have life tenure once appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nIn some cases, life tenure lasts only until a mandatory retirement age. For example, Canadian senators are appointed for life, but are forced to retire at 75. Likewise, many judges, including Justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, have life tenure but must retire at 70.\n\nLife tenure also exists in various religious organizations. The Pope, as the Bishop of Rome and leader of the worldwide Catholic Church, has life tenure, but other Catholic bishops are required to submit their resignations at age 75. Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints serve as apostles for life, but the ministry of the church are all lay clergy, therefore their positions are not considered \"life tenure\" in the church, but as a life of service to the church.\n\nSenior professors at academic institutions may also be granted life tenure, which is intended to protect principles of academic freedom.\n"}

Prattville in Autauga County, and Birmingham's Pratt City in Jefferson County (on the Pratt coal seam) are both named for him. He is buried in Pratt Cemetery, located on top of Ginshop Hill near downtown Prattville, Alabama.\n\nPratt was born in Temple, New Hampshire. He left New England in 1819 after earning a release from an architect apprenticeship that he started at age 16. He sailed for Savannah, Georgia and within two years moved to Milledgeville, Georgia. There he became a successful architect-builder and was a leader in his trade in the South by 1827. While in Georgia he met Samuel Griswold, another New Englander, who manufactured cotton gins. He had Pratt manage his factory and within a year Pratt had been promoted to partner. Pratt urged Griswold to expand into Alabama. Griswold agreed to the venture at first, but later decided against it due to conflicts there between settlers and Native Americans.\n\nPratt decided to go it alone, and moved to central Alabama in 1833 with his wife, two slaves, and enough materials to construct 50 gins. He relocated to an area known as McNeil's Mill and leased land along a creek in Autauga County in 1836, where he began manufacturing cotton gins. He moved further up the creek, bought , and built a permanent cotton gin factory in 1838. He founded the new town of Prattville for the workers in his venture. This operation quickly became the largest producer of cotton gins in the world, and Alabama's first major industry. \n\nAs his business grew, he branched out with a sawmill, gristmill, window factory, iron foundry, woollen mill, railroad, bank, and the Oxmoor Blast Furnace in Birmingham. Pratt's businesses were badly affected by the American Civil War, as many of his workers joined the military and his customer base shrank as the economy soured.\n\nMuch credit is given Pratt's efforts for easing Alabama's economic recovery during the Reconstruction period following the Civil War. His ability to call in debts on Northern accounts allowed him to rebuild his own operations, which helped make Autauga County exceptionally stable and prosperous in the period immediately after the war. It was his backing which opened the Birmingham District to its initial development as an iron-making center.\n\nOne of Pratt's slaves, Charles Atwood, purchased a house in the center of Prattville immediately after emancipation and became one of the founding investors in his former master's railroad ventures. The presence of a respected middle-class black family in the center of a 19th-century Southern city was exceptional.\n\n\n"}

Kelly and No Doubt. But after breaking her leg on a video set, Moses decided to follow her heart and make music.\n\nMoses teamed up with producer Paul Poli and signed with the Indie Record Label, TVT Records to release her debut album \"Complex Simplicity\" in August 2004. Complex Simplicity included fourteen tracks penned by Moses, with dominant production handled by Poli; the two would share a deserved executive production credit. The album underperformed on the major U.S. chart, debuting and peaking at number one hundred and sixty-eight on the Billboard 200. However, the album was critically acclaimed, otherwise finding success on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, the Top Independent Albums, and the Top Heatseekers charts, reaching number twenty, number eleven, and number ten, respectively.\n\nIn addition to executive producing and penning all the lyrics on her own project, Moses has written songs for other artists including Nivea, Christina Milian, Mary J. Blige and others. She was featured on and co-wrote two songs from Raphael Saadiq's 2004 album \"Ray Ray\", \"Chic\" and \"I Want You Back\". Her songs have been showcased in the Logo series Noah's Arc as well as in the HBO hit show Entourage, and in movies such as Never Die Alone, Beauty Shop, and Be Cool.\n\nThough Moses has not released a studio album in several years, she can be found touring and doing live shows on a regular basis. From March to November 2010 Moses was a spokesmodel on the Lady Hennessy Tour. In addition, Moses continued to release underground, all-original mixtapes for her fans to enjoy while she awaited a new label deal that was necessitated by the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filed by the now defunct TVT Records in 2008.\n\nOn March 25, 2011, it was announced that Moses had signed to rapper Rick Ross' Maybach Music Group via Warner Bros. Records as its first female artist. In 2011, Moses released the \"Luxurious Undergrind\" mixtape.\n\nIn February 2014, Moses released the single \"All I Ever Wanted,\" which samples Dynasty's 1980 song \"Adventures in the Land of Music\". The song was released as the lead single from her EP \"Cognac & Conversation\", which is co-executive produced by Rick Ross and Raphael Saadiq.\n\nIn December 2014, it was reported that Moses signed to Shanachie Records after the ill-fated alliance with Maybach Music Group. Moses revealed singer Avery Sunshine was the reason why she signed with the label, due to the success that Sunshine is having while being on Shanachie's roster. On August 8, 2015, finally her sophomore effort, Cognac & Conversation was released.\n\nWhen writing songs Moses prefers to do so alone in her own space. Commenting on this Moses said; \"I hate to admit it because it sounds so weird, but I don't like other energies around me. I need to be alone, in my own space, with just me and my music so I can be honest with whatever I feel from the music; otherwise I'm just giving something from the surface.\" Moses also tries to always be honest with her lyrical content noting it as important to her, expanding on this Moses commented saying \"If I'm honest with people, then people will feel that. And that's been my experience so far, just being frank about my feelings about life, and my experiences in life and love. I think me being honest like that is why I've gained sincere fans.

It was the first Indian sound film.\n\nIrani recognised the importance that sound would have on the cinema, and raced to complete \"Alam Ara\" before several contemporary sound films. \"Alam Ara\" debuted at the Majestic Cinema in Mumbai (then Bombay) on 14 March 1931. The first Indian talkie was so popular that \"police aid had to be summoned to control the crowds.\" The film was houseful for the next 8 weeks of its release. It was advertised with the tagline \"All living. Breathing. 100 per cent talking\".\n\nThe film has long been lost and was not available as far back as 1967 according to the National Film Archive of India, Pune.\n\nThe film is a love story between a prince and a gypsy girl, based on a Parsi play written by the Bene Israel of India member, Joseph David Penkar. David later served as a writer at Irani's film company. The story centers on an imaginary, historical royal family in the kingdom of Kumarpur. The main characters are the king, Sultan Saleem Khan (L. V. Prasad), and his two warring wives, Dilbahar Begum (Shushila), and Navbahar Begum (Zillu). Their rivalry escalates when a \"fakir\" (W. M. Khan) predicts that Navbahar will bear the king's heir.\n\nDilbahar, in a fit, attempts to have an affair with the kingdom's chief minister, General Adil Khan (Prithviraj). The affair goes sour and a vengeful Dilbahar imprisons him and exiles his daughter, Alam Ara or Alamara (Zubeida). In exile, Alamara is brought up by Gypsies. Upon returning to the palace at Kumarpur, Alamara meets and falls in love with the charming young prince, Jahangir Khan (Master Vithal). In the end, Adil is released, Dilbahar is punished and the lovers marry.\n\n\nBoth the movie and its music were widely successful, including the hit song \"De de khuda ke naam per\", which was also the first song of the Indian cinema. It was sung by actor Wazir Mohammed Khan who played a \"fakir\" in the film. As playback singing had yet to start in Indian cinema, it was recorded live with musical accompaniment of a harmonium and a tabla.\n\nIn 1929 Irani was prompted to make India’s first talking and singing film after he saw the part-talkie American film \"Show Boat\" (1929). At that time, there were no soundproof stages and technicians were unaware of how to make a film that had sound. He then decided to make a screen version of a popular stage play written by Joseph David, who agreed to adapt the play for the silver screen. Irani handled the sound recording department, using the Tanar Sound System. It was shot with the Tanar single-system camera, which recorded sound directly onto the film.\n\nThe film was mostly shot at night, between 1am and 4am with microphones hidden near the actors. The studio was near the railway tracks, and the noise of the trains disturbed the shooting during the day. Since \"Alam Ara\" was the first Indian sound film, the makers needed actors who knew the language. Ruby Myers was considered for the title character but Zubeida was cast instead. It was because Ruby Myers was an Iraqi Jew and was not fluent in Urdu or Hindustani language. The then newcomer Mehboob Khan, who later went on to make \"Mother India\" (1957), was considered for the male lead. But, they decided to cast a more commercially viable actor and chose actor-stuntman Master Vithal.\n\nThe film had music by Ferozshah M. Mistri and B. Irani, and had seven songs:\nThere is no known copy of the film today. The National Archives of India says that they do not possess a print and couldn't locate one as far back as 1967. It was incorrectly reported that the last known prints, in Pune's film archives, were damaged by a fire in 2003 when in fact no copy was ever possessed by the film archive. According to P.K. Nair, founder director of the National Film Archives of India (NFAI), Pune, \"The report that \"Alam Ara\" print was destroyed at the NFAI is incorrect.\"\n\n\"Alam Ara\" recorded as the first Hindi film of Bollywood. A total of 78 actors for the first time recorded their voices for the film.\nGoogle celebrated the 80th anniversary of the film's release by means of Google Doodle on 14 March 2011. A 2015 calendar was released exhibiting posters of some of the first Indian films, including \"Alam Ara\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2197774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197774", "title": "Eagle Mountain, California", "text": "Eagle Mountain, California\n\nEagle Mountain, California, is a modern-day ghost town in the California desert in Riverside County founded in 1948 by noted industrialist Henry J. Kaiser. The town is located at the entrance of the now-defunct Eagle Mountain iron mine, once owned by the Southern Pacific Railroad, then Kaiser Steel, and located on the southeastern corner of Joshua Tree National Park. The town's fully integrated medical care system, similar to other Kaiser operations in California, was the genesis of the modern-day Kaiser Permanente health maintenance organization. Eagle Mountain is accessible by Riverside County Route R2, twelve miles (19 km) north of Desert Center, midway between Indio and the California/Arizona state line along Interstate 10.\n\nFounded in 1948 by Kaiser Steel Corporation, Eagle Mountain is located at the entrance of the now-defunct Eagle Mountain iron mine. As the mine expanded, Eagle Mountain grew to a peak population of 4000. It had wide, landscaped streets lined with over four hundred homes, some with as many as four bedrooms. Two hundred trailer spaces and several boarding houses and dormitories provided living space for Kaiser's itinerant workforce. Other amenities included an auditorium, a park, a shopping center, a community swimming pool, lighted tennis courts, and a baseball diamond. Businesses included a bowling alley, two gas stations, eight churches and three schools.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Kaiser decided to build the West Coast's first fully integrated steel mill. In 1942, Kaiser built such a mill at Fontana, California, which is located 112 miles (180 km) west of the Eagle Mountain Mine. Today the Fontana mill site includes other successor mills and the Auto Club Speedway (formerly the California Speedway). Kaiser then purchased the idle mines from the Southern Pacific as a source of high-grade iron ore. This was a contingent strategy Kaiser used to utilize rail and raw materials for an industrial operation in a previously agricultural (pig farm) area.\n\nProduction at Fontana was initiated during World War II, increased iron shipments began in 1948, and a mining town was constructed below what was soon to become Southern California's largest iron mine. It connected to the Southern Pacific via a 51-mile-long (82 km) railroad branch known as the Eagle Mountain Railroad. It ran southwest from the mine to the northeast shore of the Salton Sea, just north of the Riverside–Imperial county line. Ore shipments to Fontana steel plant began in October, with five to eight 100-car trains running weekly. The mine's 100 millionth ton of iron ore shipped was commemorated in a ceremony on August 17, 1977.\n\nIncreased environmental concerns in the 1970s led to a reduction in iron output and a drop in population to a low of 1980. In the summer of 1980 the mine shut down briefly, reopening on September 23. Only 750 workers were brought back to the town with an additional 150 (with uncertain employment futures) in Indio, some sixty miles (97 km) west.\n\nOn November 3, 1981, Kaiser Corporation announced the phasing out of half the Fontana works and the entire Eagle Mountain Mine operation over several years. The population dwindled as layoffs began. The grocery store closed in October 1982 and the post office, which had been active since 1951, closed in 1983. In June of that year the last official graduating class celebrated their commencement at Eagle Mountain High School, followed by closing of both the mine and mill. The old high school is now the current site of Eagle Mountain Elementary School, which continues in operation (as of 2019).\n\nThe ZIP code was 92241 until Eagle Mountain shut down, mail is now sent to nearby Desert Center at 92239. The community is within area codes 442 and 760.\n\nEagle Mountain experienced a resurgence in 1986 when the California Department of Corrections proposed placing a unique privately operated prison for low-risk inmates in the town. The shopping center was converted by 1988 into the Eagle Mountain Community Correctional Facility, which operated until state budget problems and a fatal riot led to the closing of the prison in December 2003. Talks resumed in 2005 to reopen the prison facility.\n\n1988 also saw a proposal to turn the gigantic 1.5-mile-long (2.4 km) by half-mile-wide (800 m) open-pit mine into a massive, high-tech sanitary landfill. The landfill, to be operated by a partnership of two privately operated trash collection firms and the successor to Kaiser Steel, Kaiser Ventures, would ship trash by train from metropolitan Los Angeles area via the Eagle Mountain Railroad. A company subsidiary, Mine Reclamation Corp. of Palm Desert, is the landfill developer. Due to numerous lawsuits regarding the environmental effects of the landfill, the project was repeatedly delayed. The private partnership decided in late 1999 to terminate the project. Their share of the project was bought by Kaiser Ventures, making it controlling owner of the project.\n\nThe Riverside County Board of Supervisors approved the project in October 1992 after EPA approval of the project. In August 2000, Kaiser Ventures reached an agreement with the Los Angeles Sanitation District (LASD – a public entity comprising several public waste collection agencies), to purchase the landfill project as a replacement for the Puente Hills Landfill, which would be nearing the end of its useful life. Trash was to be shipped by rail from the Los Angeles area via the abandoned Eagle Mountain Railroad line. However, the sale agreement states that all lawsuits and claims regarding the project were to be resolved. As of 2008, there was one lawsuit pending. However, much has changed in the waste business since 2000. A reduction in waste generated because of recycling has reduced the urgency for the new landfill. In addition, the Los Angeles Sanitation District purchased another landfill site in Imperial County. In May 2013, the LASD discontinued plans to convert the Eagle Mountain mine into a landfill.\n\nThe Eagle Mountain mine is currently the location of a proposed 1300 MW hydroelectric plant by Eagle Crest Energy. The company agreed to buy the land from CIL&D (the new name of Kaiser Ventures) in July 2015. The Eagle Mountain Pumped Storage Project would pump groundwater from the Chuckwalla Valley aquifer into two reservoirs comprising former mining pits, where water would be pumped from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir during low electricity demand, and pumped back down through turbines during high electricity demand. In November 2016, NextEra Energy announced their partnership with Eagle Crest in the project. The project is praised by supporters for the purpose of bringing more renewable energy in California, while also being criticized by environmentalists for potential damages to plant and animal life in and around Joshua Tree National Park.\n\nAs of July 18, 2007, the town of Eagle Mountain is no longer openly accessible. The perimeters of both the town and mine have been fenced and gated, with a site manager appointed to handle access requests.\n\nThe Desert Center Unified School District at one time operated four schools in the Eagle Mountain and Desert Center areas. Eagle Mountain Elementary School was located in the center of the town, Henry J. Kaiser Junior High School and Eagle Mountain High School were located on the east and Desert Center Elementary School was located in Desert Center, 11 miles away. The class of 1983 was the last to graduate from Eagle Mountain High School. In 1983, the school district converted the high school into the Eagle Mountain Elementary School, in operation since 1983, educating students in the grades kindergarten through 8th grade.\n\nThe remaining three school sites were closed and boarded up. Local high school students are bused to Palo Verde High School in Blythe, California, making the 120-mile round trip every day. The remaining students in the school district are children of the few full-time residents of Desert Center and children of the employees of the two nearby Metropolitan Water District pumping plants.\n\nA portion of the Eagle Mountain Railroad was used in the filming of the 1986 movie \"Tough Guys\" in a scene wherein a train is hijacked - pulled by famed locomotive Southern Pacific 4449 - and run full throttle to the Mexican border. During the filming of the exterior shots of Southern Pacific 4449, the train was stored nightly at the Eagle Mountain rail yards. The local school children from Eagle Mountain School took a field trip in early 1986 to see and tour the train on the location of the shoot along the Eagle Mountain Railroad south of Interstate 10.\n\nAlso filmed on Eagle Mountain was \"\". The 3D film was made for a Universal Studios theme park attraction and is an action sequence based on the original \"Terminator 2 – Judgment Day\" movie. Universal Studios in Los Angeles premiered its version of the \"Terminator 2 3D\" ride in 1999. The ride is also at Universal's Orlando, Florida, location. The entire crew spent weeks at Eagle Mountain.\n\nOther films using Eagle Mountain locations include\n\n\"Top Gear USA\" has used Eagle Mountain twice so far. In season 2's third episode, \"America's Strongest Pickup,\" Eagle Mountain was used for the final challenge including pulling down a house. The final challenge in the 13th episode of \"Top Gear USA\" third season was staged at Eagle Mountain. Entitled 'Doomsday Drive,' Eagle Mountain served as a stand-in for a post-apocalyptic setting.\n\n\n"}

He was Minister of Defense between the victory of the Sandinista revolution in 1979 under the National Reconstruction Government, through the first presidency of his brother Daniel Ortega Saavedra, and through the presidency of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro who defeated Daniel Ortega in the elections of 1990.\n\nHumberto Ortega, his brother, the current President of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, and Victor Tirado López founded the Tercerista tendency of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) in 1975. He, among others leaders, crafted the urban insurrection strategy that ignited civil war in Nicaragua in October 1977 which led to the fall of the Somoza dynastic dictatorship in July 1979. As Minister of Defense during the decade of Sandinista rule, Ortega oversaw the buildup of the Sandinista Popular Army (EPS) and the prosecution of the war against the \"contra\" resistance factions and their peasant support base.\n\nFollowing the electoral defeat of Daniel Ortega and the Sandinista Party in 1990, Humberto maintained control of the military. Later that year accusations arose against Humberto claiming his involvement in the murder and cover up of sixteen-year-old Jean Paul. Ortega's bodyguards allegedly shot and killed the young man when he attempted to pass the generals motorcade on October 28, 1990. In November 1990 the Nicuraugan National Assembly along with experts from the Venisualan Ministry of Justice began an investigation of this incident. Most of the evidence found by the investigators proved to be circumstantial and the travel records for the motorcade were never found. Civil District Judge Boanerges Ojeda suggested Ortega's bodyguards, two officers, and Humberto be tried in court before he passed the case to the military prosecutors office where it was closed in July 1992. He retired in 1995, turning the job over to his second in command, Joaquín Cuadra. General Humberto Ortega started transforming the EPS into the non-political Nicaraguan National Army. Allegedly, he was behind the assassination of many retired anti-sandinistas rebels. This allegation has not been put forward by any legal authority inside or outside of Nicaragua.\n\nIn December 2004 he released a book titled \"La Epopeya de la Insurrección\" (Epic of the Insurrection). Ortega says he worked 10 hours a day on the book for two years using his own records, meeting notes, archives and analytical schemes to reconstruct the history of the struggle that ultimately brought down the 43-year Somoza family dictatorship. Among his other books are, \"50 Años de Lucha Sandinista\", \"Sobre la Insurrección\" and \"Nicaragua Revolución y Democracia\".\n\n\nWebsite for the book.

{"id": "2197831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197831", "title": "Abu al-Misk Kafur", "text": "Abu al-Misk Kafur\n\nAbu al-Misk Kafur (905–968), also called al-Laithi, al-Suri, al-Labi was a dominant personality of Ikhshidid Egypt and Syria. Originally a black slave, probably from Nubia, he was promoted as vizier of Egypt, becoming its de facto ruler from 946. After the death of his master, Muhammad bin Tughj, Kafur succeeded the latter to become the \"de jure\" ruler of the Ikshidid domains, Egypt and southern Syria (including Damascus), until his death in 968.\n\nKafur is described by the sources variously as coming from Abyssinia (Ethiopia), the Bilad al-Sudan (Land of the Blacks) or Nubia, the latter being the most probable. Muhammad ibn Tughj, the founder of the Ikhshidid dynasty of Egypt, purchased him as a slave in 923. He is recorded as having a dark complexion and being a eunuch. Recognizing the slave's intelligence and talent, Ibn Tughj freed him. The story goes that Kafur was freed because he kept his eyes fastened upon his master, while others kept their eyes on the master's gifts. Thus, historian Philip Hitti notes, Kafur would be generously rewarded for such loyalty.\n\nIbn Tughj appointed Kafur to be the supervisor of princely education for his two sons. The Egyptian ruler then promoted Kafur as a military officer. As a field commander Kafur conducted a military mission to Syria in 945. He was put in charge of some campaigns in the Hejaz. Kafur was involved in some diplomatic exchanges between the Ikhshidids and the caliph of Baghdad.\n\nKafur became the \"de facto\" ruler of Egypt in 946 (since Kafur was the guardian of bin Tughj's sons, he ruled in their stead upon the death of their father). He died in Cairo and was probably buried in Jerusalem. Though subsequent historians have portrayed him as a just and moderate ruler, he owes a great deal of his fame to the scathing satirical poems directed against him by al-Mutanabbi, a famous medieval Arab poet.\n\nKafur's status as former slave did not hinder him from rising to power under the Ikhshidids. In fact, his status helped him, as it had become customary for former slaves to enter the military organization and even reach high positions in it. Kafur's rise to power, from being an African slave to the ruler of Egypt and parts of Syria, is one of the first examples in Islamic history of a sovereign with the lowliest of origins. In Muslim states in general, Africans such as Kafur did not continue to be slaves. They were employed in various occupations and maintained a cohesive culture interacting with that of their hosts.\n\nWhile Kafur held \"de facto\" control over Egypt, he operated behind the facade of Ikhshdid rulers. On his deathbed, Ibn Tughj had appointed Kafur as guardian over his two sons. In 946, Kafur helped Anūdjūr secure the succession to Ibn Tughj. And in 961, he helped ʿAlī ibn al-Ikhshīd, Anūdjūr's younger brother (and his late master Ibn Tughj's second), secure the Egyptian throne. Only in 966, following the death of ʿAlī, did Kāfūr publicly declare himself as the sole master of Egypt.\n\nKafur, despite tremendous pressure on him, maintained stability inside Egypt. From 947 to 948, he fought and put down the rebellion by Ghalbūn. In 954 he successfully averted an abortive coup d'état by Anūdjūr. He also survived the spread of subversive Ismāʿīlī propaganda against him. His ability to resolve internal political complications is considered as having significantly prolonged the lifespan of the Ikhshidids.\n\nOne of Abu al-Misk Kafur's greatest achievements is his successful protection of the Ikhshidid establishment from the Hamdanids (in Syria), Fatimids (in northern Africa, to the west of Egypt), Qarmatians (in the Arabian peninsula), and the Nubians (from south of Egypt).\n\nVery early on Kafur's master, Muhammad ibn Tughj, trusted him to handle the military campaigns of Syria and Hejaz (in the Arabian peninsula). His military and diplomatic measures secured Damascus for the Ikhshidids (from the Hamdanids) in 947. Sayf ad-Dawla, governor of Aleppo, had tried to overrun Syria, but his efforts were frustrated by Kafur, and the former recognized the latter's lordship over parts of Syria.\n\nHe was also able to delay the Fatimid expansion into Egypt, frustrating the efforts of the latter's agents. So long as Kafur was alive, the Ikhshidid establishment kept the Fatimids at bay; upon his death, the Fatimids took over.\n\nKafur generally maintained economic stability in Egypt, despite serious setbacks:\n\nExcepting the heavy government expenditure, Kafur's administration refrained from extortionate fiscal practices. His gold coinage displayed remarkable stability, though it did fluctuate. Kafur also enrolled the services of competent administrators, and merchants, (such as the famous Yaqub ibn Killis), contributing to his economic accomplishments.\n\nAbu al-Misk Kafur gained popularity by being the patron of scholars and writers. Perhaps the most celebrated patronage, according to A.S. Ehrenkreutz, is that of the great poet al-Mutanabbi. In return al-Mutanabbi praised the former slave. However, after Kafur's failure to reward him with high office that he aspired, al-Mutanabbi ridiculed Kafur. Thus Kafur was immortalized in the poetry of al-Mutanabbi - the greatest poet of Kafur's time, according to historian Hitti.\n\nAs he was a pious man, Kafur was more comfortable with the ulema (Muslim scholarly establishment) than the poets. He surrounded himself with religious men, some of whom he showered with gifts. He constructed two mosques in Giza and on al-Muqattam and a hospital. Nevertheless, he still clung to superstitions, abandoning a home once, believing it to be under a \"jinn\".\n\nKafur also maintained a magnificent and luxurious court. This, however, at times of famine, accorded poorly with the general population. In addition to the mosques and the hospital, Kafur had constructed a number of sumptuous palaces, and the \"Kāfūriyya\" gardens in his capital. No archaeological remains of his contributions have been found thus far.\n\n"}

Missouri Scholars Academy should not be confused with the Missouri Student Association, with which it shares an acronym.\n\nMissouri Scholars Academy began in 1985, and has been held every year since. Each year is represented by a distinct pair of colors to identify its participants beyond their time at the Academy.\n\nParticipating scholars attend a \"major\" and \"minor\" class for three hours and one and one half hours per day, respectively, during the program. These classes are usually college level or experimental. Past MSAs have featured unique classes covering topics such as Japanese language and culture, Intelligence & Counterintelligence, Game Theory, Time travel, Infinity, Terrorism & Counterterrorism, Education, Philosophy, Biology, Physics, Neurology, The Constitution, Censorship, current events, spelunking, creative writing, and art.\nParticipants are encouraged to choose classes of different disciplines, as one of the primary focuses of the program is to promote academic diversity and the expansion of interests in its Scholars. \n\nAfter minor classes end, multiple extracurricular activities are offered to continue activity and learning for scholars. Activities include, but are assuredly not limited to: Scrabble Tournaments, math and logic puzzles, lectures and discussions, conducting lessons, yoga, African drumming and song, and other multidisciplinary and contemporary programs.\n\nNotable guests of the Academy include motivational speaker Kevin Wanzer and harpist Maria Duhova. \n\nAlumni of Missouri Scholars Academy (scholars who have gone through the program) are invited back to participate in activities, including Afternoon Activities, on a weekend day during the Academy.

{"id": "2197838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197838", "title": "Odontoblast", "text": "Odontoblast\n\nIn vertebrates, an odontoblast is a cell of neural crest origin that is part of the outer surface of the dental pulp, and whose biological function is dentinogenesis, which is the formation of dentin, the substance beneath the tooth enamel on the crown and the cementum on the root.\n\nOdontoblasts are large columnar cells, whose cell bodies are arranged along the interface between dentin and pulp, from the crown to cervix to the root apex in a mature tooth. The cell is rich in endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, especially during primary dentin formation, which allows it to have a high secretory capacity; it first forms the collagenous matrix to form predentin, then mineral levels to form the mature dentin. Odontoblasts form approximately 4 μm of predentin daily during tooth development.\n\nDuring secretion after differentiation from the outer cells of the dental papilla, it is noted that it is polarized so its nucleus is aligned away from the newly formed dentin, with its Golgi complex and endoplasmic reticulum towards the dentin reflecting its unidirectional secretion. Thus with the formation of primary dentin, the cell moves pulpally, away from the basement membrane (future dentinoenamel junction) at the interface between the inner enamel epithelium and dental papilla, leaving behind the odontoblastic process within the pulp. The odontoblastic cell body keeps its tapered structure with cytoskeletal fibres, mainly intermediate filaments. Unlike cartilage and bone, as well as cementum, the odontoblast's cell body does not become entrapped in the product; rather, one long, cytoplasmic attached extension remains behind in the formed dentin. The differentiation of the odontoblast is done by signaling molecules and growth factors in the cells of the inner enamel epithelium.\n\nLike enamel, dentin is avascular. Nutrition for odontoblasts within the dentin comes through the dentinal tubules from tissue fluid that originally traveled from the blood vessels located in the adjacent pulp tissue. Within each dentinal tubule is a space of variable size containing dentinal fluid, an odontoblastic process, and possibly an afferent axon (see next discussion). The dentinal fluid in the tubule presumably also includes the tissue fluid surrounding the cell membrane of the odontoblast, which is continuous from the cell body in the pulp.\n\nIt has been shown that odontoblasts secrete the extracellular matrix protein reelin.\n\nA pulpal A-delta (noxious, short sharp pain) nerve fibre is either wrapped around the base of this process, or travels a short way into the dentinal tubule with the odontoblast process (max ~0.1 mm) This process lies in the dentinal tubule. In an erupted tooth, this process rarely extends beyond 1/3 the depth of the dentin, which is why the odontoblast transduction theory of dentinal hypersensivity is unlikely.\n\nOdontoblasts first appear at sites of tooth development at 17–18 weeks in utero and remain present until death unless killed by bacterial or chemical attack, or indirectly through other means such as heat or trauma (e.g. during dental procedures). Odontoblasts were originally the outer cells of the dental papilla. Thus, dentin and pulp tissue have similar embryological backgrounds, because both are originally derived from the dental papilla of the tooth germ.\n\n\nThe odontoblasts secrete dentin throughout life, unlike enamel, which is considered secondary dentin once root formation is complete, which may be an attempt to compensate for natural wear of the enamel. This is because of the retention of the odontoblasts within the tooth, along the outer pulpal wall.\n\nOdontoblasts also secrete tertiary dentin when irritated. Tertiary dentin secreted by odontoblasts is often due to chemical attack, either by chemicals diffusing through the dentin and insulting the odontoblasts, or by diffusion of toxic bacterial metabolites down the dentinal tubules in the instance of a carious attack with dental decay. This tertiary dentin is called reactionary dentin. This is an attempt to slow down the progress of the caries so that it does not reach the pulp.\n\nIn the case of an infection breaching the dentin to or very near the pulp, or in the instance of odontoblast death due to other attack (e.g. chemical or physical), undifferentiated mesenchymal cells can differentiate into odontoblast-like cells which then secrete another type, reparative dentin, underneath the site of attack. This is not only to slow the progress of the attack, but also prevents the diffusion of bacteria and their metabolites into the pulp, reducing the probability of partial pulp necrosis.\n\nThe distinction of the two kinds of tertiary dentin is important, because they are secreted by different cells for different reasons. Reactionary dentin is secreted at varying speeds, dependant on the speed of progression of caries in the outer dentin surface. Histologically, it is easily distinguishable by its disordered tube structure, the location of the secretion (it protrudes into the pulpal cavity) and its slightly lower degree of mineralization than normal. The tooth is often able to be saved by a simple restoration. In contrast, reparative dentin is secreted when the tooth has a poor prognosis.\n\nTeeth in the molluscan radula are also produced by cells termed \"odontoblasts\".\n\n"}

During this time he reportedly formed a close relationship with former Xinjiang governors Seyfuddin Eziz and Ismail Emet and was involved in the translation of Eziz's works. Tohti began studying for his PhD at Tokyo University's School of Humanities in Japan in 1995, specializing in Uyghur history and ethnic relations. He has reportedly published several papers on Uyghur history in Japan and has published a book in Beijing.\n\nTohti was first arrested by Chinese authorities on February 6, 1998, a few weeks into a trip to Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region for research purposes. His only proven \"crime\" appears to be that of obtaining and copying part of a 50-year-old document for his research with the help of an official librarian, which the authorities claimed was \"stealing state secrets.\" According to Amnesty International an article published in the January 2001 issue of China’s national security newsletter, Tohti Tunyaz “turned his back on his homeland” by going to Japan to study for his PhD, where he “came under the influence of western liberal thinking” and “engaged in Xinjiang minority splittist activities”.\n\nOn November 10, 1998, Chinese authorities charged Tohti with \"stealing state secrets for foreign persons\" and \"inciting national disunity,\" the latter charge allegedly for publishing a book in Japan in 1998 entitled The Inside Story of the Silk Road. According to the Chinese government the book advocates ethnic separation; scholars in Japan, however, insist no such book exists. He was convicted by the Ürümqi Intermediate People's Court on March 10, 1999, and following an appeal, was sentenced by China's Supreme Court on February 15, 2000 to 11 years in prison with an additional two years' deprivation of political rights.\n\nThe court decision was based on the supposition that the defendant intended to publish a book in Japanese for the purpose of instigating national disunity, and made copies of confidential documents at Urmuchi in order to leak them to foreigners. However, according to the decision handed down at Urumchi in August 1999, neither the book nor its manuscript was submitted to the court as evidence. As far as his teachers and colleagues know, Tohti wrote no such book in Japan. As to leaking confidential documents, Tohti received copies from a librarian after he had been given permission from the authorities to do so. Furthermore, the foreigner who was alleged to have received the documents was never identified at the trial. Consequently, it can be concluded that the decision was based on a misrepresentation of the facts concerning Tohti's scholarly activities. His real and only intention was to collect source materials in order to complete his doctoral thesis dealing with the modern history of the Uyghur people.\n\nTohti served his 11-year sentence in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Prison No. 3 in the provincial capital of Ürümqi, and according to English language reports, he was released from prison on February 10, 2009. \nAccording to his friends and supporters in Japan:\n1) After his release, he was taken to Beijing to serve the additional two-year sentence (until February 2011) of deprivation of political rights under the strict surveillance of local authorities.\n2) Although technically \"a free man\" and therefore free to return to Japan to continue his studies (where the University of Tokyo still considers him as a matriculating student), the Chinese government has stopped issuing passports to Uyghurs under its jurisdiction.\n3) Today Tohti earns a living as a language adviser for the English language edition of a Chinese magazine, while making efforts to recover his research from the shambles in which he found it after his release from prison. \nIt is unknown whether his wife, a Japanese citizen, and children are with him or not. Hopefully so.\nIn December 2001, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an official opinion declaring Mr. Tohti to be arbitrarily detained.\n\nTohti was honoured in 2002 with a PEN/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award.\n\n"}

Theologian Paul Johnson considers such beliefs a topic of concern for the mental health of clergy. Other martyr complexes involve willful suffering in the name of love or duty. This has been observed in women, especially in poor families, as well as in codependent or abusive relationships. \n\nThe desire for martyrdom is sometimes considered a form of masochism. Allan Berger, however, described it as one of several patterns of \"pain/suffering seeking behavior\", including asceticism and penance.\n\n"}
{"id": "2197855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197855", "title": "Dentinogenesis", "text": "Dentinogenesis\n\nDentinogenesis is the formation of dentin, a substance that forms the majority of teeth. Dentinogenesis is performed by odontoblasts, which are a special type of biological cell on the outer wall of dental pulps, and it begins at the late bell stage of a tooth development. The different stages of dentin formation after differentiation of the cell result in different types of dentin: mantle dentin, primary dentin, secondary dentin, and tertiary dentin.\n\nOdontoblasts differentiate from cells of the dental papilla. This is an expression of signaling molecules and growth factors of the inner enamel epithelium (IEE).\n\nThey begin secreting an organic matrix around the area directly adjacent to the IEE, closest to the area of the future cusp of a tooth. The organic matrix contains collagen fibers with large diameters (0.1-0.2 μm in diameter). The odontoblasts begin to move toward the center of the tooth, forming an extension called the odontoblast process. Thus, dentin formation proceeds toward the inside of the tooth. The odontoblast process causes the secretion of hydroxyapatite crystals and mineralization of the matrix (mineralisation occurs due to matrix vesicles). This area of mineralization is known as mantle dentin and is a layer usually about 20-150 μm thick.\n\nWhereas mantle dentin forms from the preexisting ground substance of the dental papilla, primary dentin forms through a different process. Odontoblasts increase in size, eliminating the availability of any extracellular resources to contribute to an organic matrix for mineralization. Additionally, the larger odontoblasts cause collagen to be secreted in smaller amounts, which results in more tightly arranged, heterogeneous nucleation that is used for mineralization. Other materials (such as lipids, phosphoproteins, and phospholipids) are also secreted. There is some dispute about the control of mineralization during dentinogenesis.\n\nThe dentin in the root of a tooth forms only after the presence of Hertwig epithelial root sheath (HERS), near the cervical loop of the enamel organ. Root dentin is considered different from dentin found in the crown of the tooth (known as coronal dentin) because of the different orientation of collagen fibers, as well as the possible decrease of phosphophoryn levels and less mineralization.\n\nMaturation of dentin or mineralization of predentin occurs soon after its apposition, which takes place two phases: primary and secondary. Initially, the calcium hydroxyapatite crystals form as globules, or calcospherules, in the collagen fibers of the predentin, which allows for both the expansion and fusion during the primary mineralization phase. Later, new areas of mineralization occur as globules form in the partially mineralized predentin during the secondary mineralization phase. These new areas of crystal formation are more or less regularly layered on the initial crystals, allowing them to expand, although they fuse incompletely.\n\nIn areas where both primary and secondary mineralization have occurred with complete crystalline fusion, these appear as lighter rounded areas on a stained section of dentin and are considered globular dentin. In contrast, the darker arclike areas in a stained section of dentin are considered interglobular dentin. In these areas, only primary mineralization has occurred within the predentin, and the globules of dentin do not fuse completely. Thus, interglobular dentin is slightly less mineralized than globular dentin. Interglobular dentin is especially evident in coronal dentin, near the DEJ, and in certain dental anomalies, such as in dentin dysplasia.\n\nSecondary dentin is formed after root formation is finished and occurs at a much slower rate. It is not formed at a uniform rate along the tooth, but instead forms faster along sections closer to the crown of a tooth. This development continues throughout life and accounts for the smaller areas of pulp found in older individuals.\n\nTertiary dentin is deposited at specific sites in response to injury by odontoblasts or replacement odontoblasts from the pulp depending on the severity of the injury. Tertiary dentin can be divided into reactionary or reparative dentin. Reactionary dentin is formed by odontoblasts when the injury does not damage the odontoblast layer. Reparative dentin is formed by replacement odontoblasts when the injury is so severe that it damages a part of the primary odontoblast layer. Thus a type of tertiary dentin forms in reaction to stimuli, such as attrition or dental caries.\n\n"}
{"id": "2197857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197857", "title": "Acosmism", "text": "Acosmism\n\nAcosmism, in contrast to pantheism, denies the reality of the universe, seeing it as ultimately illusory (the prefix \"a-\" in Greek meaning negation; like \"un-\" in English), and only the infinite unmanifest Absolute as real. Conceptual versions of Acosmism are found in eastern and western philosophies.\n\nThe concept of Maya in the non-dual Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism is a form of acosmism. Maya means \"illusion, appearances\". The universe is considered to be Māyā, however this does not mean the universe is considered as unreal. Wendy Doniger explains, \"to say that the universe is an illusion (māyā) is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. Māyā not only deceives people about the things they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge to things that are epistemologically and ontologically second-rate.\"\n\nIn the Vedanta school of Hinduism, the perceived world is Maya that hides the Absolute and Ultimate Reality (Brahman). The human mind constructs a subjective experience, states Vedanta, which leads to the peril of misunderstanding Maya as well as interpreting Maya as the only and final reality. Vedantins assert the \"perceived world including people are not what they appear to be, there is more to them than their perceived physical forms\". Māyā is that which manifests, perpetuates a sense of false duality (or divisional plurality). This manifestation is real, but it obfuscates and eludes the hidden principles and true nature of reality. Vedanta holds that liberation is the unfettered realization and understanding of these invisible principles, primarily that the individual Self (Soul) is the same as the Self in others and the Self in everything (Brahman).\n\nAdvaita Vedanta school is best described as monistic, absolute idealism, while Dvaita Vedanta school as pluralistic idealism. Both have elements of ontological acosmism, where the material aspect of cosmos is considered an \"illusion, appearance, incomplete reality\" compared to that \"which is spiritual, eternal, unchanging\". In Advaita Vedanta philosophy, there are two realities: \"Vyavaharika\" (empirical reality) and \"Paramarthika\" (absolute, spiritual reality). Māyā is a fact in that it is the appearance of phenomena. Brahman (Ultimate Reality, Absolute, Cosmic Soul) is held by Advaitins as the metaphysical truth. The perceived world, Māyā is true in epistemological and empirical sense; however, Māyā is not considered by Vedantins as the metaphysical and spiritual truth. The spiritual truth is the truth forever, while what is empirical truth is only true for now. Since Māyā is the perceived material world, it is true in perception context, but is \"untrue\" in spiritual context of Brahman. True Reality, to Advaita scholars, includes both \"Vyavaharika\" (empirical) and \"Paramarthika\" (spiritual), the Māyā and the Brahman. The goal of spiritual enlightenment, state Advaitins, is to realize one's soul as same as Cosmic Soul (Brahman), realize the eternal, fearless, resplendent Oneness.\n\nAdvaita Hinduism and Buddhism have both been called as examples of acosmism. Other scholars state Buddhism cannot be accurately classified as a philosophy based on acosmism, and that Advaita Vedanta is not acosmism either.\n\nAcosmism has been seen in the work of a number of Western philosophers, including Parmenides, Plato, Spinoza, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, and British and American idealists, such as F.H. Bradley. The word acosmism is often traced to Hegel who used it in his discussion of the philosophy of religion, in particular his understanding of pantheism and refutation of the charge that Spinoza was an atheist. Hegel explains that for Spinoza it is the infinite 'substance' which is real, while the finite world does not exist. \"But the accusers of Spinozism are unable to liberate themselves from the finite; hence they declare for Spinozism everything is God, because it is precisely the aggregate of finitudes (the world) that has there disappeared. If one employs the expression \"All is One\" and [claims] therefore that unity is the truth of multiplicity, then the \"all\" simply is no longer. The multiplicity vanishes, for it has its truth in the unity.\" W.T. Stace sees all philosophical acosmism as rooted in the mystical experience, whether or not the authors are aware of this. Stace points out that most Western philosophers tend to a form of qualified acosmism, where the world is less real rather than utterly illusory. He sees two mystical sources of acosmism from within the eternal moment, firstly the mystical moment contains all eternity and infinity and thus there is nothing outside it, and secondly because the eternal moment is experienced as the supreme value.\n\n"}

In a fast reactor, they may require fewer neutrons to achieve fission, as well as producing more neutrons when they do fission.\n\nA fast-neutron reactor, meaning one with little or no neutron moderator and hence utilising fast neutrons, can be configured as a breeder reactor, producing more fissile material than it consumes, using fertile material in a blanket around the core, or contained in special fuel rods. Since plutonium-238, plutonium-240 and plutonium-242 are fertile, accumulation of these and other nonfissile isotopes is less of a problem than in thermal reactors, which cannot burn them efficiently. Breeder reactors using thermal-spectrum neutrons are only practical if the thorium fuel cycle is used, as uranium-233 fissions far more reliably with thermal neutrons than plutonium-239.\n\nProposed applications for fertile material includes a space-based facility for the manufacture of fissile material for spacecraft nuclear propulsion. The facility would notionally transport fertile materials from Earth, safely through the atmosphere, and locate them at a space facility at the Earth–Moon L1 Lagrangian point where manufacture of fissile material would occur, eliminating the safety risk of transport of fissile materials from Earth.\n"}

He faced top level competition throughout his career, winning the IBA light welterweight title in 2004.\n\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, Augustus (born as Burton) grew up in Louisiana and boxed out of Baton Rouge. He recently resided in Brownsville, Texas and boxed at Grechy's Pound 4 Pound Gym located in Sydney, Australia for a brief period of time. Currently, after getting shot in a random shooting and recovering, Augustus lives with family and friends in Baton Rouge, Louisiana\".\n\nBurton took up boxing at the age of 17, he fought for two years as an amateur, ascending to the nationals. As the amateur contests were perceived by him as \"boring,\" he began thinking about professional career.\n\nWith 27 amateur fights under his belt he turned pro.\n\nAugustus began his boxing career under his birth name Emanuel Burton. However, in 2001, when his parents married, Burton adopted his father's last name of Augustus. He retained the nickname \"YA\", short for his middle name Ya'kov. Emanuel has frequently appeared on ESPN2's boxing programs \"Tuesday Night Fights\" and its counterpart \"Friday Night Fights\".\n\nAugustus's televised bouts garnered him a cult following, in part due to his unique 'Dragon Master' style flair in the ring, and his willingness to take on all comers, taking fights on short notice as a last minute replacement even in opponents' hometowns. Augustus frequently clowned in the ring to frustrate his opponents, engaging in his trademark \"string-puppet dance.\" Augustus was also known for losing close controversial decisions on the road.\n\nAugustus achieved a measure of fame after his bout against Courtney Burton on July 6, 2004, which he lost by controversial close decision. The state of Michigan investigated the points verdict for Burton, but did not overturn the result. Augustus demanded a rematch, and got it, avenging his loss to Burton on September 1, 2006, when he stopped Burton in the eighth round on ESPN with the help of a left hook to the body. The rematch win was ironic, because Augustus was disallowed a knockdown from a left hook to the body in their first fight after referee Dan Kelley claimed instead the knockdown was a caused by an illegal low blow. The punch actually landed on Burton's beltline, which is termed 'the border' in professional boxing refereeing.\n\nThe best win of Augustus' career ratings wise was against Carlos Wilfredo Vilches on July 19, 2002. Augustus took the fight on just 2 days' notice after Vilches' original opponent, Vince Phillips, pulled out due to injury. Vilches was 37-1-2 at the time and was a ranked fighter. During the bout, Vilches wanted to keep Augustus at bay with a stiff jab. Augustus continued to pressure Vilches, and landed counter right hands over the top of Vilches' left jab. A cut opened up near the left eye of Vilches, which eventually resulted in an upset eighth round stoppage win for Augustus. The win vaulted Augustus to the number two worldwide ratings position in the International boxing Federation light welterweight division. However, Augustus followed with four decision losses and one controversial draw to tough opponents, including Omar Gabriel Weis, over whom Vilches already held a victory.\n\nAt least one of Augustus' losses was questionable. On June 6, 1999, Danish boxer Allan Vester won his bout with Augustus with one second left in the twelfth and final round. Augustus was knocked down by a flurry of punches which occurred in the final seconds of the bout, and did not get up in time. Augustus later admitted he gave up out of frustration near the end of the bout, stating, \"I just felt out of order, out of place.\"\n\nAs a journeyman Augustus faced top talent his whole career and has an outstanding resume when it comes to experiencing the best the sport has to offer.\n\n\nOn April 2, 2004, Augustus became the IBA light welterweight champion defeating Alex Trujillo by unanimous decision.\n\nOn December 9, 2006, he became the WBC Continental Americas light welterweight champion by defeating Russell Stoner Jones.\n\nOn July 4, 2008, he knocked out Jakkirt Suwunnalirt in Sydney, Australia, to win the WBO Oriental welterweight title.\n\nAugustus was the IBA light welterweight champion between April 2, 2004, and June 18 of that year. Augustus lost his title when referee Laurence Cole disqualified him in his first title defense against Tomas Barrientes. At the time of disqualification, Augustus was ahead on all three judges' scorecards. He was disqualified for pushing, talking back to the referee, and not looking into his eyes when asked to.\n\nHis fight against \"Irish\" Micky Ward on July 13, 2001, was voted 2001 ESPN \"Fight of the Year\", as well as 2001 \"Ring\" magazine Fight of the Year. In June 2008 ESPN announced that this fight had been nominated for its \"Fight of the Decade\" award. Augustus was also named \"ESPN's Most Memorable Fighter\".\n\nDuring a 2012 interview with boxing expert Dan Rafael, Floyd Mayweather Jr. stated Augustus was the toughest opponent he had faced in his career.\n\nOn the night of October 13, 2014, Augustus was critically wounded after being hit in the back of the head by a random gunshot and was on life support. Baton Rouge Police named 21-year-old Christopher Stills as a suspect in the crime, but subsequently dropped charges due to lack of witnesses or evidence of intent, as Stills was alleged to have fired a gun several times in the air but not at a target. Augustus eventually recovered, and was living with his sister in Baton Rouge. As of 2016, Augustus was engaged to be married, was in improved health and spirits, and had returned in training.\n\n"}

The game is based around packs of werewolves battling each other and various evil monsters while trying to save the world.\n\nRage had five sets of cards:\nThe game was discontinued by White Wolf after Legacy and the license sold to Five Rings Publishing Group (FRPG).\n\nFRPG produced a new version of the game with the same card backs and set in the same world, but with completely different mechanics making it incompatible with the first version of the game. The second version of the game had seven card sets. The first 6 were numbered and released once a month. They were known as Phase 1 through 6. The final set, Equinox, combined together three of the smaller numbered sets (7-9) into one larger set.\n\nFRPG was bought out by Wizards of the Coast (the makers of ), who were in turn bought out by Hasbro. Hasbro discontinued many of the games it had acquired in the take over, including Rage. The license for the game lapsed back to White Wolf.\n\nAzrael Productions, who produced an online magazine, acquired permission from White Wolf to provide tournament support for both versions of Rage. However, Azrael was unable to acquire the license to bring Rage back into print. While under Azrael's care, there were two notable developments. The first version of Rage came to be called \"Rage: Apocalypse\" and the second version \"Rage: Tribal War\" so people would not be confused as to which version people were talking about.\n\nAzrael Productions also assembled a group of dedicated fans to start designing new cards for the game. They started playtesting these cards before Azrael eventually abandoned the project. Azrael gave up rights to the partially tested cards, leaving the path clear for the playtesters to produce fan-made sets of cards.\n\nThe first set of these fan made cards, Intermezzo, was released in 2003. A total of five fan made sets for Rage: Apocalypse (Intermezzo, Periphery, Gauntlet, and Coda. They are collectively known as the New England Block. War Council is the fifth set and starts the Ahadi block.) and two for Tribal War (Web of Deceit and Christmas Present '04) have been released since then. The cards are hosted on the official Rage site, River Von, but are considered legitimate by White Wolf and are allowed in regular tournaments and for use in online play. They are not hosted on the main White Wolf server due to copyright issues with the artwork.\n\nRage was available for online play for several years via the gatlingEngine, produced by CCG Workshop. They had a licensing agreement with White Wolf allowing them to develop online versions of White Wolf's CCG properties (Rage, Vampire: the Eternal Struggle, and Arcadia: the Wyld Hunt). That platform is now defunct.\n\nDue to complex legal issues, only Rage: Apocalypse is available for online play. Hasbro retains some partial rights to Rage: Tribal War and was unwilling to license it to CCG Workshop.\n\nWhile Rage is currently out of print, it can be played online using a program called LackeyCCG. Instructions on how to get started are at the Rage website. It runs on both PC and Mac and includes all printed cards, all fan sets and sets in playtesting.\n\nA major rules overhaul for Rage's rules was released in March 2006. The update clarified many card interactions and converted rulings about individual cards to global rulings. There was an additional update (Rage's Least Wanted) that errata'd the 18 most broken cards in the game and introduced new rules for Past Lives that returned them to play.\n\nNovember 2006 saw the release of the first set in the Ahadi block, War Council. This set introduced updates to the frenzy rules, Moot and Board Meeting rules, changed when the first combat hand was drawn, and allowed some Prey and Allies access to additional Gifts. War Council also introduced a new Wyrm faction to the game, the Unbound, and made the 7th Generation part of a larger faction, Cults. Additional Gaia and Wyrm factions will be introduced throughout the Ahadi block.\n\nSeptember 2007 has a flurry of Rage activity. Rainmakers, the second set in the Ahadi block, was released. It introduced the new Ajaba (werehyena) faction, fleshed out the Pentex Executives and Mokole, and introduced the first of the new Rogue characters. The new Revised rules were introduced. These were largely a reorganization of the old rules book, but also introduced a new timing system. The long overdue rewrite to the rules for Battlefields was also released for Beta testing.\n\nHellcats (2011) introduced the Simba (werelions) and Bagheera (wereleopards) to Rage, as well as the eponymous Hellcats. This mixture of corrupted Caelican and fallen Simba was only briefly mentioned in and Rage expanded significantly on the source material. Curse of Set (2012) introduced a new subfaction of Cults, the vampiric Walid Set.\n\nCall of the Sea is a four set block released in 2013 and 2014 with a semi-constructed deck format. It was also intended as a new introductory set for new or returning players which would make it easier to learn the game. Three faction decks and one combat set were released for use in either regular or sealed deck format. Chulorviah introduced a new Cults faction featuring mind controlling squid beasts. (Chulorviah originally appeared in World of Darkness: Blood Dimmed Tides source book). Rokea expanded the shark shapeshifters to a full playable faction. Sea Dogs was a split deck with one captain each for Gaia and WYrm with most of the rest of the characters being Rogues, so would be either Gaia or Wyrm characters depending on which captain you selected for your ship. The combat set works with any of the three decks, but had six cards for each deck that were specially marked as working best with that faction.\n\n2014 also saw rerelease of Least Wanted with a second update to account for additional rules updates and the new sets that had been released in the previous 8 years.\n\n2015 the 20th anniversary rules update was released along and a major overhaul of errata for previous sets was started. Conclave block entered playtesting and the first set of the Conclave block was released at the end of the year. Rise of Kupala expanded the Cults faction to include infernalists. A fan vote was held at end of the year to determine new members of the Silver Pack for the Conclave block.\n\nThe New England block was revised and remastered in higher quality in 2016. Updated errata was released for most sets.

{"id": "2197884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197884", "title": "Colorado River Delta", "text": "Colorado River Delta\n\nThe Colorado River Delta is the region where the Colorado River flows into the Gulf of California (also known as the Sea of Cortez) in eastern Mexicali Municipality in the north of the state of Baja California in northwestern-most Mexico. The delta is part of a larger geologic region called the Salton Trough. Historically, the interaction of the river's flow and the ocean's tide created a dynamic environment, supporting freshwater, brackish, and saltwater species. Within the delta region, the river split into multiple braided channels and formed a complex estuary and terrestrial ecosystems. The use of water upstream and the accompanying reduction of freshwater flow has resulted in the loss of most of the wetlands of the area, as well as drastic changes to the aquatic ecosystems. However, a scheme is currently in place which aims to rejuvenate the wetlands by releasing a pulse of water down the river delta.\n\nUntil the early 20th century, the Colorado River ran free from its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado southwest into Mexico, where it flowed into the Gulf of California. Significant quantities of nourishing silt from throughout the Colorado River Basin were carried downstream, creating the vast Colorado River Delta.\n\nPrior to the construction of major dams along its route, the Colorado River fed one of the largest desert estuaries in the world. Spread across the northernmost end of the Gulf of California, the Colorado River delta's vast riparian, freshwater, brackish, and tidal wetlands once covered 7,810 km² (1,930,000 acres) and supported a large population of plant, bird, aquatic, and terrestrial life. Because most of the river's flow reached the delta at that time, its freshwater, silt, and nutrients helped create and sustain a complex system of estuarial wetlands that provided feeding and nesting grounds for birds, and spawning habitat for fish and marine mammals. In contrast to the surrounding Sonoran Desert, the Colorado River delta's abundance was striking.\n\nEarly explorers reported jaguars, beavers, deer, and coyotes in the delta, in addition to the abundance of waterfowl, fish, and other marine and estuary organisms (Spamer, 1990; {Aldo Leopold, 1948}). Early explorers also encountered local people known as the Cucapá, or the people of the river. The Cucapá are descendants of the Yuman-speaking Native Indigenous peoples of the Americas and have inhabited the delta for nearly a thousand years. Spanish explorer Hernando de Alarcón made the first recorded contact with the Cucapá in 1540 and reported seeing many thousands. The Cucapá used the delta floodplain extensively for harvesting Palmer's saltgrass (\"Distichlis palmeri\"), a wild grain that grows in salty soil, and for cultivating maize (corn), beans, and squash.\n\nToday, conditions in the delta have changed. Like other desert river deltas, such as the Nile Delta and the Indus River Delta, the Colorado River delta has been greatly altered by human activity. Decades of dam construction and water diversions in the United States and Mexico have reduced the delta to a remnant system of small wetlands and brackish mudflats. As reservoirs filled behind dams and captured floodwaters, freshwater could no longer reach the delta.\n\nThe construction of Hoover Dam in the 1930s marked the beginning of the modern era for the Colorado River Delta. For six years, as Lake Mead filled behind the dam, virtually no freshwater reached the delta. Even spring flooding was captured. This ecologically devastating event was repeated from 1963 to 1981 as Lake Powell filled behind the Glen Canyon Dam. With these reservoirs now filled, the dams are used to regulate flow so that water can be reliably apportioned among the users of the Colorado River Compact, and its use maximized. Most flood flows can be contained, regulated, and added to the river's capacity to sustain the Western United States' urban centers and agriculture. Floodwaters are released only when the Bureau of Reclamation, the agency managing the dams, predicts flows that exceed the system's capacity for use and storage.\n\nThe loss of freshwater flows to the delta over the twentieth century has reduced delta wetlands to about 5 percent of their original extent, and non-native species have compromised the ecological health of much of what remains. Stress on ecosystems has allowed invasive plants to out-compete native species along Colorado River riparian areas. Native forests of cottonwood and willow have yielded to sand and mudflats dominated by the nonnative tamarisk (also known as salt cedar), arrow weed, and iodine bush, a transformation that has decreased the habitat value of the riparian forest (Briggs and Cornelius, 1997).\n\nFull reservoir conditions coupled with a series of flood events throughout the 1980s and early 1990s resulted in flood releases that reached the delta. These flows reestablished an active floodplain and revegetated many areas of the floodplain within irrigation and flood control levels, and helped to reestablish riparian forests.\n\nThe delta supports a variety of wildlife, including several threatened and endangered species. Mexico's Environmental Regulations on Endangered Species lists the following endangered species found in the terrestrial and aquatic regions of the delta (Diario Officiel, 1994):\n\n\nAlthough not extensively studied, the delta's significance for migratory birds is indisputable, as it is the principal freshwater marsh in the region. A total of 358 bird species have been documented in the Colorado River Delta and the upper Gulf of California region. From these, two are listed as endangered, six as threatened, and sixteen are under special protection in Mexico. Two wintering species and five breeding species have been locally extirpated, including the southwestern willow flycatcher, the Fulvous whistling duck, and the sandhill crane.\n\nThe Gulf of California lies within the jurisdictional boundaries of Mexico and its states of Baja California and Sonora. In 1974, the Mexican government designated portions of the upper Gulf and lower Colorado River Delta as a reserve zone.\n\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) designated over 12,000 km² (3 million acres) of Gulf of California and Colorado River Delta Biosphere Reserve as a Biosphere Nature reserve in June 1993. Within this 12,000 km² (3 million acres), over 4,000 km² (1 million acres) nearest the Colorado River Delta are designated as the Reserve \"core area\", with the remaining 8,000 km² (2 million acres) of open water and shoreline designated as a \"buffer area\".\n\nUNESCO considers areas for designation as Biosphere Reserves only after the nation in which the site is located submits a nomination. Once designated, Biosphere Reserves remain under the sovereign jurisdiction of the countries where they are located. Federal Mexican governmental agencies with administrative authority over the Biosphere Reserve include the National Commission of Protected Natural Areas (CONANP) and the Secretary of the Environment, Natural Resources and Fisheries (SEMARNAP).\n\nIn addition to designation as a Biosphere Reserve, 2500 km² (618,000 acres) within Colorado River Delta (Humedales del Delta del Río Colorado) are designated as a Ramsar Wetland under the U.N. Convention on Wetlands. Ramsar Wetlands are wetlands of international importance in terms of their ecology, botany, zoology, limnology or hydrology. The U.N. designation is considered following a nomination by the nation in which the site is located.\n\n"}

Freekey also serves as the owner/CEO of 730 Dips Records.\n\nAside from The Diplomats, he is also a member of fellow rapper Jim Jones' ByrdGang, and has made a habit of yelling his name in songs; it is his signature on tracks, whether he is featured or the solo artist.\n\nGiles, along with his cousin Cam'ron and their friend Jim Jones formed the hip-hop group The Diplomats in their hometown of Harlem, New York in 1997. Giles adopted the stage name Freekey Zekey and the group began writing and performing songs together. In the early years of the group, Zekey served mostly as a hype man, yelling adlibs or his name during other members' songs and performances. Zekey was responsible for writing and performing almost all of the skits on Diplomat mixtapes and Cam'ron’s albums, and did this until he was sentenced to 35–42 months in prison in February 2004. While in prison, Zekey began writing his own songs and honed his skills as a rapper. Just a few weeks after being released from prison in November 2006, Freekey signed a contract with Asylum Records to release his debut album, Book of Ezekiel. The album was released on July 24, 2007, and featured guest appearances from other members of The Diplomats, including Cam'ron, Jim Jones and Juelz Santana. The album peaked at #23 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart. After The Diplomats effectively disbanded in 2007, Freekey went on to form his own label/group, the 730 Dips, and also joined Jim Jones' new group, ByrdGang.\n\nGiles is the first cousin of Cam’ron, and was a childhood friend of Jim Jones and Damon Dash.\n\nOn April 25, 2003, Giles and his crew were involved in a minor car collision outside of a Manhattan nightclub, after another car collided with the back of the vehicle Giles and his crew were inside of. After stepping out of their vehicle, the men in the other car attempted to rob Giles and his friends. Giles was shot once in the abdomen and sustained minor injuries after the incident. In total, over 44 bullets were fired at Giles and his crew during the altercation, and one member of Giles’ entourage, his bodyguard Eric Mangrum, was killed. In December 2005, Chauncey Dillon was sentenced to 30 years in prison for both robbery and the murder of Mangrum.\n\nGiles was sentenced to 35–42 months in prison on February 5, 2004 for running an ecstasy ring.

Baxley and starring Tom Berenger, Bokeem Woodbine, Dan Butler and Linden Ashby. The film was released direct to video on March 11, 2003.\n\nThe film follows a Marine sniper and a spotter who are tasked with assassinating a Serbian general responsible for ethnic cleansing attacks. It is the sequel to the 1993 film \"Sniper\" and the second installment in the \"Sniper\" film series.\n\nFormer U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance Scout Sniper Thomas Beckett (Tom Berenger), who was discharged after his finger was amputated in the first film, is met by CIA officer James Eckles (Dan Butler) and Colonel David McKenna (Linden Ashby) at his home. Despite losing his index finger he uses to shoot, Beckett still has the capability of firing a gun. Considering this, along with his impressive career from his time in the Marine Corps, Beckett is given a mission to assassinate renegade Serbian General Mile Valstoria (Peter Linka), who is responsible for conducting hit-and-run ethnic cleansing operations in the Muslim-populated areas of Serbia. The CIA fears that Valstoria's actions are threatening to inflame a larger conflict in the region. Beckett agrees to participate, but requests that an additional man, a spotter, must come with him. Beckett is introduced to his spotter, Jake Cole (Bokeem Woodbine), an experienced U.S. Army sniper who is on death row for killing a federal officer who allegedly betrayed him. Cole is released and offered a pardon if he takes part in the mission.\n\nAfter being dropped off into Serbia, Beckett and Cole make their way to a Catholic basilica. There, they meet an underground resistance member named Sophia (Erika Marozsán). Sophia takes them to her apartment, which is perched high above the designated area where Valstoria is due to show up, near a government building. The next morning, Beckett assassinates his target. Valstoria's killing puts the city into lockdown. After their original extraction point is compromised, Cole and Beckett are forced to find an alternative plan. When they hitch a ride on a public tram, nearby soldiers stop the vehicle and try to arrest them, but the two operatives take over the tram and ram it into some police cars. They soon exit the tram, running through the streets. Cole is captured and put into a prison where Valstoria's men keep their so-called 'special enemies', but Beckett is able to escape.\n\nBeckett meets Sophia that night, and the two make a plan to rescue Cole. With the help of Sophia's brothers, Zoran and Vojislav (Ferenc Kovács and Barna Illyés), the next day the box in military trucks carrying Cole and a fellow prisoner to a prison where Cole was to be executed. They ambush the convoy and then help Cole and Pavel (Tamás Puskás), who is a pacifist and political dissident, out of the truck and into a van that Zoran brought. Cole admits to Beckett that the assassination of Valstoria was set up to get Cole caught and then rescue Pavel from jail and brought out of Serbia. That night, at an abandoned factory that was meant to be the designated extraction zone, the group is ambushed by a tank and infantry. Both Vojislav and Zoran are killed in the attack and, after escaping from the factory through a sewer, Beckett orders Sophia to break off from the group and leave.\n\nA distance away from the factory, Pavel insists that they should head to Komra, a Muslim town where a friend of Pavel's, Nauzad (Zoltán Seress), lives. As the group meets Nauzad, he offers to help get the men to the border by getting them to a bus that would get them there. Within a couple of hours they are on their way but, as they cross a river, they come across an unexpected checkpoint and end up heading to Simand, the secondary extraction point, on foot. Meanwhile, Cpt. Marks (Can Togay) inspects the bus that the three men just departed from and suspects that they are attempting to head to Simand. Marks orders a tracker, (Béla Jáki), to take his special forces unit to Simand.\n\nAs the three men arrive at Simand, they are ambushed by the special forces team in a forest outside of town, and Pavel suffers a slight flesh wound in the arm. After the trio kills the entire team, they are forced to proceed into town. The tracker holds up in the town factory and snipes down the team. Beckett demands that Cole take Pavel to the extraction zone while he deals with the tracker. Cole is severely wounded by the sniper, but Beckett picks him off. Pavel and Becket carry the wounded Cole into the helicopter and leave, just as Serb reinforcements led by Cpt. Marks arrive. In the helicopter, Beckett and Pavel look at Cole as he is badly wounded. Cole says, \"Freedom!\" and succumbs to his wounds.\n\nThe film has been criticised for technical flaws, for example: The Serbs depicted were speaking Hungarian rather than Serbian (as the actors playing the Serbs were all Hungarian and Cole spoke gibberish instead of Hungarian).\n\n"}

He was the founder of the Sunni Ikhshidid dynasty, which ruled the region until the Fatimid conquest of 969.\n\nThe son of Tughj ibn Juff, a general of Turkic origin who served both the Abbasids and the autonomous Tulunid rulers of Egypt and Syria, Muhammad ibn Tughj was born in Baghdad but grew up in Syria and acquired his first military and administrative experiences at his father's side. He had a turbulent early career: he was imprisoned along with his father by the Abbasids in 905, was released in 906, participated in the murder of the vizier al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara'i in 908, and fled Iraq to enter the service of the governor of Egypt, Takin al-Khazari. Eventually he acquired the patronage of several influential Abbasid magnates, chiefly the powerful commander-in-chief Mu'nis al-Muzaffar. These ties led him to being named governor first of Palestine and then of Damascus. In 933, he was briefly named governor of Egypt, but this order was revoked after the death of Mu'nis, and Ibn Tughj had to fight to preserve even his governorship of Damascus. In 935, he was re-appointed to Egypt, where he quickly defeated a Fatimid invasion and stabilized the turbulent country. His reign marks a rare period of domestic peace, stability and good government in the annals of early Islamic Egypt. In 938 Caliph al-Radi granted his request for the title of \"al-Ikhshid\", which had been borne by the rulers of his ancestral Farghana Valley. It is by this title that he was known thereafter.\n\nThroughout his governorship, al-Ikhshid was engaged in conflicts with other regional strongmen for control over Syria, without which Egypt was vulnerable to invasion from the east, but unlike many other Egyptian leaders, notably the Tulunids themselves, he was prepared to bide his time and compromise with his rivals. Although he was initially in control of the entirety of Syria, he was forced to cede the northern half to Ibn Ra'iq between 939 and 942. Following Ibn Ra'iq's murder, al-Ikhshid reimposed his control over northern Syria, only to have it challenged by the Hamdanids. In 944 al-Ikhshid met Caliph al-Muttaqi at Raqqa; the caliph had fled there from the various strongmen vying to kidnap him and control the caliphal government in Baghdad. Although unsuccessful in persuading the caliph to come to Egypt, he received recognition of hereditary rule over Egypt, Syria and the Hejaz for thirty years. Following his departure, the ambitious Hamdanid prince Sayf al-Dawla seized Aleppo and northern Syria in the autumn of 944, and although defeated and driven out of Syria by Ibn Tughj himself in the next year, a treaty dividing the region along the lines of the agreement with Ibn Ra'iq was concluded in October. Ibn Tughj died nine months later, leaving his son Unujur as ruler of his domains, under the tutelage of the powerful black eunuch Abu al-Misk Kafur.\n\nAccording to the biographical dictionary compiled by Ibn Khallikan, Muhammad ibn Tughj was born in Baghdad on 8 February 882, on the street leading to the Kufa Gate. His family was of Turkic origin from the Farghana Valley in Transoxiana, and claimed royal descent; the name of his ancestor, \"Khaqan\", is a Turkic royal title. Muhammad's grandfather Juff left Farghana to enter military service in the Abbasid court at Samarra, as did the father of Ibn Tulun, the founder of the Tulunid dynasty. Juff and his son, Muhammad's father Tughj, both served the Abbasids, but Tughj later entered the service of the Tulunids, who since 868 had become autonomous rulers of Egypt and Syria. Tughj served the Tulunids as governor of Tiberias (capital of the district of Jordan), Aleppo (the capital of the district of Qinnasrin) and Damascus (capital of the homonymous district). He played a major role in repelling the Qarmatian attack on Damascus in 903; although defeated in battle, he held the city itself against the Qarmatians for seven months until, with the arrival of reinforcements from Egypt, the Qarmatians were driven away. Thus Muhammad ibn Tughj spent a great part of his youth in the Tulunid Levant at his father's side, gaining his first experiences in administration—he served as his father's sub-governor of Tiberias—and war.\n\nAfter the death of Ibn Tulun's son Khumarawayh in 896, the Tulunid state quickly began crumbling from within, and failed to put up any serious resistance when the Abbasids moved to re-establish direct control over Syria and Egypt in 905. Tughj defected to the invading Abbasids under Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib, and was named governor of Aleppo in return; Muhammad al-Katib himself fell victim to court intrigues soon after, and Tughj along with his sons Muhammad and Ubayd Allah were imprisoned in Baghdad. Tughj died in prison in 906, and the brothers were freed shortly after. The sons of Tughj participated in the palace coup that tried to depose the new caliph, al-Muqtadir (reigned 908–932), in favour of the older Ibn al-Mu'tazz in December 908. Although the attempt failed, Muhammad ibn Tughj and his brother were able to avenge themselves for their imprisonment on the vizier al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara'i, whom they struck down with the aid of Husayn ibn Hamdan. After the coup's failure, the three fled: Ibn Hamdan returned to his native Upper Mesopotamia and Ubayd Allah fled east to Yusuf ibn Abi'l-Saj, while Muhammad fled to Syria.\n\nIn Syria, Muhammad ibn Tughj joined the service of the tax supervisor of the local provinces, Abu'l-Abbas al-Bistam. He soon followed his new master to Egypt, and after al-Bistam's death in June 910 he continued serving the latter's son. Eventually, he gained the attention of the local governor, Takin al-Khazari, who sent him to govern the lands beyond the Jordan River, with his seat at Amman. In 918, he rescued a \"hajj\" caravan, among which was one of the ladies-in-waiting of al-Muqtadir's mother, from Bedouin raiders, thereby improving his standing at the Abbasid court. Two years later, Ibn Tughj gained an influential patron when he briefly served under the powerful Abbasid commander-in-chief Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, when he came to help defend Egypt from a Fatimid invasion. During the campaign, Ibn Tughj commanded the finest troops of the Egyptian army. The two men evidently established a rapport, and remained in contact thereafter.\n\nWhen Takin returned to Egypt as governor in 923, Ibn Tughj joined him there, but the two men fell out in 928 over Takin's refusal to give Ibn Tughj the post of governor of Alexandria. Ibn Tughj escaped the capital Fustat by a ruse, and managed to obtain for himself an appointment as governor of Palestine from Baghdad; the incumbent, al-Rashidi, fled the governor's seat at Ramla for Damascus, whose governorship he assumed. His flight, according to historian Jere L. Bacharach, may indicate that Ibn Tughj commanded a significant military force. Three years later, in July 931, Muhammad ibn Tughj was promoted to governor of Damascus, while al-Rashidi returned to Ramla. Both these appointments were likely the result of Ibn Tughj's relation with Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, who at this time was at the zenith of his power and influence.\n\nTakin died in March 933, and his son and nominated successor, Muhammad, failed to establish his authority in Egypt. Ibn Tughj was named as the new governor in August but the appointment was revoked a month later before he could reach Egypt, and Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh was appointed in his place. The timing of Ibn Tughj's recall coincides with the arrest (and subsequent murder) of Mu'nis by Caliph al-Qahir () on 22 September, suggesting that Ibn Tughj's nomination was in all likelihood also due to Mu'nis. The fact that al-Qahir sent a eunuch called Bushri to replace Ibn Tughj in Damascus after the fall of Mu'nis reinforces this view. Bushri was able to take over the governorship of Aleppo (to which he also had been appointed), but Ibn Tughj resisted his replacement, and defeated and took him prisoner. The caliph then charged Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh with forcing Ibn Tughj to surrender, but although Ahmad marched against Ibn Tughj, both avoided a direct confrontation. Instead, the two men met and reached an agreement of mutual support, upholding the status quo.\n\nAhmad ibn Kayghalagh soon proved incapable of restoring order to the increasingly turbulent province. By 935, the troops were rioting over lack of pay, and Bedouin raids had recommenced. At the same time, Takin's son Muhammad and the fiscal administrator Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ali al-Madhara'i—the heir of a dynasty of bureaucrats that had handled the province's finances since the time of Ibn Tulun and amassed enormous wealth—undermined Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh and coveted his position. Infighting broke out among the troops between the Easterners (\"Mashariqa\"), chiefly Turkish soldiers, who supported Muhammad ibn Takin, and the Westerners (\"Maghariba\"), probably Berbers and Black Africans, who backed Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh. With the support this time of the former vizier and inspector-general of the western provinces al-Fadl ibn Ja'far ibn al-Furat, whose son was married to one of Ibn Tughj's daughters, Ibn Tughj was once more named the governor of Egypt. Taking no chances, Ibn Tughj organized an invasion of the country by land and sea. Although Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh was able to delay the advance of the army, Ibn Tughj's fleet took Tinnis and the Nile Delta and moved on to the capital Fustat. Outmanoeuvred and defeated in battle, Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh fled to the Fatimids. The victorious Muhammad ibn Tughj entered Fustat on 26 August 935.\n\nWith the capital under his control, Ibn Tughj now had to confront the Fatimids. The \"Maghariba\" who refused to submit to Ibn Tughj had fled to Alexandria and then to Barqa under the leadership of Habashi ibn Ahmad, and invited the Fatimid ruler al-Qa'im () to invade Egypt with their assistance. The Fatimid invasion met with initial success: the Fatimid army's Kutama Berbers captured the island of al-Rawda on the Nile and burned its arsenal. Ibn Tughj's admirals Ali ibn Badr and Bajkam defected to the Fatimids, and Alexandria itself was captured in March 936. Nevertheless, on 31 March, Ibn Tughj's brother al-Hasan defeated the Fatimid forces near Alexandria, driving them out of the city and forcing the Fatimids to once again retreat from Egypt to their base at Barqa. During the campaign, Ibn Tughj notably prohibited his troops from looting, which, according to J. L. Bacharach, was indicative of his \"long-term view towards his stay in Egypt\".\n\nWriting to Caliph al-Radi () in 936, Muhammad ibn Tughj could present a commendable record: the Fatimid invasion was defeated and first measures for improving the financial situation in the province had been undertaken. The caliph confirmed him in his post and sent robes of honour. As Hugh N. Kennedy writes, \"in some ways the Fatimid threat actually helped Ibn Tughj\" since, as long as he supported the Abbasids, \"the caliphs were prepared to give their approval to his rule in return\". His standing in the Abbasid court was sufficient for him to ask in 938 for the honorific title (\"laqab\") of \"al-Ikhshid\", originally held by the kings of his ancestral homeland Farghana. Caliph al-Radi granted the request, although formal approval was delayed until July 939. After receiving official confirmation, Ibn Tughj required that he be henceforth addressed solely by his new title.\n\nVery little is known about al-Ikhshid's domestic policies. Nevertheless, the silence of the sources about domestic troubles during his reign—apart from a minor Shi'ite revolt in 942, which was swiftly suppressed—stands in stark contrast to the usual narrative of Bedouin raids, urban riots over high prices, or military and dynastic revolts and intrigues, and indicates that he was successful in restoring internal tranquillity and orderly government in Egypt. According to the biographical dictionary of Ibn Khallikan, he was \"a resolute prince, displaying great foresight in war, and a close attention to the prosperity of his empire; he treated the military class with honour and governed with ability and justice\". His potential rivals Muhammad ibn Takin and al-Madhara'i were quickly won over and incorporated in the new administration. The latter had tried to resist al-Ikhshid's takeover in vain, as his troops had immediately defected, and was initially imprisoned by al-Ikhshid, only to be released in 939. He soon recovered his status and influence, and briefly served as regent of al-Ikhshid's son and heir, Unujur in 946, before being overthrown and imprisoned for a year. Thereafter, and until his death in 957, he retired into private life. Like the Tulunids before him, al-Ikhshid also took particular care to build up a considerable military force of his own, including Turkic and Black African slave soldiers.\n\nAs commander and ruler in Egypt, al-Ikhshid was a patient and cautious man. He achieved his goals as much by diplomacy and ties to powerful personages in the Baghdad regime as by force, and even then he tended to avoid direct military confrontation whenever possible. His conflict with Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh was indicative of his approach: instead of a direct clash, the truce between the two gave al-Ikhshid the time to reconnoitre the situation in Egypt before acting. Although following in the footsteps of Ibn Tulun, his ambitions were more modest and his objectives more practical, as became particularly evident in his policies towards Syria and the rest of the Caliphate. Historically, possession of Syria, and particularly Palestine, was a foreign policy objective for many rulers of Egypt, to foreclose the most likely invasion route into the country. Ibn Tulun before and Saladin after al-Ikhshid were two typical examples of Egyptian rulers who spent much of their reigns securing control of Syria, and indeed used Egypt mostly as a source of revenue and resources to accomplish this goal. Al-Ikhshid differed from them; Bacharach describes him as a \"cautious, conservative realist\". His goals were limited but clear: his main concern was Egypt proper and the establishment of his family as a hereditary dynasty over it, while Syria remained a secondary objective. Unlike other military strongmen of the time, he had no intention of entering the contest for control of Baghdad and the caliphal government through the all-powerful office of \"amir al-umara\"; indeed, when Caliph al-Mustakfi () offered him the post, he turned it down.\n\nFollowing the expulsion of the Fatimids from Egypt, al-Ikhshid had his troops occupy all of Syria up to Aleppo, allying himself, as Ibn Tulun had done, with the local tribe of Banu Kilab to strengthen his hold over northern Syria. As governor of Syria, his remit extended to the borderlands (\"thughur\") with the Byzantine Empire in Cilicia. Thus in 936/7 or 937/8 (most likely in autumn 937) he received an embassy from the Byzantine emperor, Romanos I Lekapenos (), to organize a prisoner exchange. Although carried out in the name of Caliph al-Radi, it was a special honour and an implicit recognition of al-Ikhshid's autonomy, since correspondence and negotiations for such events were normally directed to the caliph rather than provincial governors. The exchange took place in autumn 938, resulting in the release of 6,300 Muslims for an equivalent number of Byzantine captives. As the Byzantines held 800 more prisoners than the Muslims, these had to be ransomed and were gradually released over the next six months.\n\nWhile the \"amir al-umara\" Ibn Ra'iq was in power in Baghdad (936–938) with al-Ikhshid's old friend al-Fadl ibn Ja'far ibn al-Furat as vizier, relations with Baghdad were good. Following Ibn Ra'iq's replacement by the Turk Bajkam, however, Ibn Ra'iq received a nomination by the caliph to the governorship of Syria and in 939 marched west to claim it from al-Ikhshid's forces. Ibn Ra'iq's appointment enraged al-Ikhshid, who sent an envoy to Baghdad to clarify the situation. There Bajkam informed him that the caliph might appoint whomever he chose, but that it ultimately did not matter: it was military strength that would determine who was governor of Syria and even of Egypt, not any appointment by a figurehead caliph. If either Ibn Ra'iq or al-Ikhshid emerged victorious from the conflict, caliphal confirmation would soon follow. Al-Ikhshid was even more infuriated by the reply, and reportedly for a time even threatened to give one of his daughters to the Fatimid caliph al-Qa'im and to have coins minted and the Friday prayer read in his name rather than the Abbasid caliph, until the Abbasids formally reconfirmed his position. The Fatimids themselves were preoccupied with the revolt of Abu Yazid and were unable to offer any assistance.\n\nFrom Raqqa, Ibn Ra'iq's troops swiftly took over the districts of northern Syria, where al-Ikhshid's brother Ubayd Allah was governor, while the Egyptian forces retreated south. By October or November, Ibn Ra'iq's men had reached Ramla and moved on into the Sinai. Al-Ikhshid led his army against Ibn Ra'iq, but after a short clash at al-Farama, the two men came to an understanding, dividing Syria between them: the areas from Ramla to the south would be under al-Ikhshid, and the areas to the north under Ibn Ra'iq. In May or June 940, however, al-Ikhshid learned that Ibn Ra'iq had once again moved against Ramla. Once more, the Egyptian ruler led his army to battle. Although defeated at al-Arish, al-Ikhshid was able to quickly rally his troops and ambush Ibn Ra'iq, preventing him from entering Egypt proper and forcing him to retreat back to Damascus. Al-Ikhshid sent his brother, Abu Nasr al-Husayn, with another army against Ibn Ra'iq, but he was defeated and killed at Lajjun. Despite his victory, Ibn Ra'iq opted for peace: he gave Abu Nasr an honourable burial and sent his son, Muzahim, as envoy to Egypt. True to his political strategy, al-Ikhshid accepted. The agreement saw the restoration of the territorial status quo of the previous year, but with al-Ikhshid paying an annual tribute of 140,000 gold \"dinars\". The deal was cemented by the marriage of Muzahim with al-Ikhshid's daughter Fatima.\n\nPeace did not last for long, as the political turmoil in Baghdad continued. In September 941, Ibn Ra'iq assumed once more the post of \"amir al-umara\" at the invitation of Caliph al-Muttaqi (), but he was not as powerful as before. Unable to stop the advance of another strongman, Abu'l-Husayn al-Baridi of Basra, both Ibn Ra'iq and the caliph were forced to abandon Baghdad and seek the help of the Hamdanid ruler of Mosul. The latter soon had Ibn Ra'iq assassinated (April 942) and succeeded him as \"amir al-umara\" with the \"laqab\" of Nasir al-Dawla. Al-Ikhshid used the opportunity to reoccupy Syria for himself, joining his forces in person in June 942, and venturing as far as Damascus, before returning to Egypt in January 943. The Hamdanids also staked claim on Syria at the same time, but the sources do not record details of their expeditions there. Nasir al-Dawla's position as \"amir al-umara\" also proved to be weak, and in June 943 he was ousted by the Turkish general Tuzun. In October, Caliph al-Muttaqi, fearing that Tuzun intended to replace him, fled the capital and sought refuge with the Hamdanids. Although Nasir al-Dawla and his brother Sayf al-Dawla sheltered the caliph, they also did not confront Tuzun's troops, and in May 944 they reached an agreement that gave Upper Mesopotamia and northern Syria to the Hamdanids in exchange for recognizing Tuzun's possession of Iraq. Nasir al-Dawla sent his cousin al-Husayn ibn Sa'id to take over the Syrian provinces allotted to him in this agreement. The Ikhshidid forces either defected or retreated, and al-Husayn swiftly took over the districts of Qinnasrin and Hims.\n\nIn the meantime, al-Muttaqi with Sayf al-Dawla had fled to Raqqa before Tuzun's advance, but the caliph grew increasingly suspicious of the Hamdanids, and wrote to al-Ikhshid (perhaps as early as the winter of 943), asking for aid. The latter immediately responded by leading an army into Syria. The Hamdanid garrisons withdrew before him, and in September 944, al-Ikhshid reached Raqqa. Distrusting the Hamdanids given their treatment of Ibn Ra'iq, he waited until Sayf al-Dawla had left the city before entering it to meet the caliph. Al-Ikhshid tried without success to persuade al-Muttaqi to come with him to Egypt, or at least to stay in Raqqa, while the caliph tried to get al-Ikhshid to march against Tuzun, which the latter refused. The meeting was not entirely fruitless, as al-Ikhshid secured an agreement that virtually repeated the terms of a similar treaty between the Tulunid Khumarawayh and Caliph al-Mu'tamid in 886. The caliph recognized the authority of al-Ikhshid over Egypt, Syria (with the \"thughur\"), and the Hejaz (carrying with it the prestigious guardianship of the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina), for a period of thirty years, with the right of hereditary succession for al-Ikhshid's sons. This development had already been anticipated by al-Ikhshid the previous year, when he named his son Unujur as his regent during his absences from Egypt, although Unujur had not yet come of age, and had required an oath of allegiance (\"bay'a\") to be sworn to him. Nevertheless, as Michael Brett comments, the territories conferred were \"mixed blessings\", as the holy cities were exposed to Qarmatian raids, while the marches of the \"thughur\" were increasingly menaced by the Byzantines, and Aleppo (with northern Syria) was coveted by the Hamdanids.\n\nAs it happened, al-Muttaqi was persuaded by the emissaries of Tuzun, who protested his loyalty, to return to Iraq, only to be seized, blinded and deposed on 12 October and replaced by al-Mustakfi. Al-Mustakfi reconfirmed al-Ikhshid's governorship, but by this point it was an empty gesture. According to J. L. Bacharach, although the 13th-century historian Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi reports that al-Ikhshid immediately took the \"bay'a\" and read the Friday prayer in the new caliph's name, based on the available numismatic evidence, he appears to have delayed recognition of both al-Mustakfi and his Buyid-installed successor al-Muti () for several months by refraining from including them in his coinage, in an act that was a deliberate and clear statement of his \"de facto\" independence from Baghdad. This independence was also acknowledged by others; the contemporary \"De Ceremoniis\" records that in the correspondence of the Byzantine court, the \"Emir of Egypt\" was accorded a golden seal worth four \"solidi\", the same as the caliph in Baghdad.\nFollowing his meeting with al-Muttaqi, al-Ikhshid returned to Egypt, leaving the field open for the ambitious Sayf al-Dawla. The Ikhshidid forces left behind in Syria were relatively weak, and the Hamdanid leader, having gained the support of the Banu Kilab, had little difficulty in capturing Aleppo on 29 October 944. He then began extending his control over the provinces of northern Syria down to Hims. Al-Ikhshid sent an army under the eunuchs Abu al-Misk Kafur and Fatik against the Hamdanid, but it was defeated near Hama and retreated back to Egypt, abandoning Damascus and Palestine to the Hamdanids. Al-Ikhshid was then forced to once again campaign in person in April 945, but at the same time he sent envoys proposing to Sayf al-Dawla an agreement along the lines of the one with Ibn Ra'iq: the Hamdanid prince would get to keep northern Syria, while al-Ikhshid would pay him an annual tribute for the possession of Palestine and Damascus. Sayf al-Dawla refused and reportedly even boasted that he would conquer Egypt itself, but al-Ikhshid held the upper hand: his agents managed to bribe several Hamdanid leaders, and he won over the citizens of Damascus, who barred their gates before the Hamdanid and opened them for al-Ikhshid. The two armies met near Qinnasrin in May, where the Hamdanids were defeated. Sayf al-Dawla fled to Raqqa, leaving his capital Aleppo to be captured by al-Ikhshid.\n\nNevertheless, in October the two sides came to an agreement, broadly on the lines of the earlier Ikhshidid proposal: al-Ikhshid acknowledged Hamdanid control over northern Syria and even consented to sending an annual tribute in exchange for Sayf al-Dawla's renunciation of all claims on Damascus. The Hamdanid ruler was also to marry one of al-Ikhshid's daughters or nieces. For al-Ikhshid, the maintenance of Aleppo was less important than southern Syria with Damascus, which was Egypt's eastern bulwark. Provided that these remained under his control, he was more than willing to allow the existence of a Hamdanid state in the north. The Egyptian ruler knew that he would have difficulty in asserting and maintaining control over northern Syria and Cilicia, which had traditionally been influenced more by Upper Mesopotamia and Iraq. By abandoning its claims on these distant provinces, not only would Egypt be spared the cost of maintaining a large army there, but the Hamdanid emirate would also fulfil the useful role of a buffer state against incursions from both Iraq and a resurgent Byzantine Empire. Indeed, throughout al-Ikhshid's rule, and that of his successors, relations with the Byzantines were quite friendly, as the lack of a common border and the common hostility to the Fatimids guaranteed that the interests of the two states did not clash. Despite Sayf al-Dawla's attempt to push again into southern Syria soon after al-Ikhshid's death, the border agreed in 945 held, and even outlived both dynasties, forming the dividing line between Mesopotamian-influenced northern Syria and the Egyptian-controlled southern part of the country until the Mamluks seized the entire region in 1260.\n\nIn mid-spring 946, al-Ikhshid sent emissaries to the Byzantines for yet another prisoner exchange (which eventually would take place under Sayf al-Dawla's auspices in October). Emperor Constantine VII () sent an embassy under John Mystikos in response, which arrived at Damascus on 11 July. On 24 July 946, al-Ikhshid died in Damascus. The succession of his son Unujur was peaceful and undisputed, due to the influence of the powerful and talented commander-in-chief, Kafur. One of the many Black African slaves recruited by al-Ikhshid, Kafur remained the paramount minister and virtual ruler of Egypt over the next 22 years, assuming power in his own right in 966 until his death two years later. Encouraged by Kafur's demise, in 969 the Fatimids invaded and conquered Egypt, beginning a new era in the country's history.\n\nMedieval historians noted the many parallels between al-Ikhshid and his Tulunid predecessors, especially Khumarawayh. Ibn Sa'id even reported that according to Egyptian astrologers, the two men had entered Egypt on the same day of the year and with the same star in the same ascendant. There were important differences, however: al-Ikhshid lacked the \"flamboyance\" (Hugh Kennedy) of the Tulunids. Al-Ikhshid's caution and self-imposed restraint in his foreign policy objectives also stood in stark contrast with his contemporaries and other rulers of Egypt who preceded and followed him, earning him a reputation of extreme caution, often misinterpreted as timidity by contemporaries. He was also described as less cultivated than his predecessor Ibn Tulun. Unlike Ibn Tulun, who built an entire new capital at al-Qatta'i and a famous mosque, al-Ikhshid was neither a patron of artists and poets nor a major builder. According to historian Thierry Bianquis, he was described by medieval chroniclers as \"a choleric and gluttonous man, yet shrewd and inclined toward avarice\", but with a fondness for luxuries imported from the east, and especially perfumes. His love of eastern luxuries soon spread among the upper classes of Fustat as well and influenced the style and fashion of local Egyptian products in turn, which began to imitate them.\n\n"}

The series prominently shows the bravery of the volunteers at the Battle of San Juan Hill, part of the Spanish–American War of 1898. It was released on DVD in 2006. The series originally aired on TNT with a four-hour running time, including commercials, over two consecutive nights during July 1997.\n\nIn 1898 the US government decided to intervene on the side of the Cuban rebels in their struggle against Spanish rule. Assistant Navy Secretary Theodore Roosevelt decides to experience the war first hand by promoting and joining a volunteer cavalry regiment.\n\nThe regiment, later known as the Rough Riders, brings together volunteers from all corners of the nation and all walks of life. They include a stagecoach robber, Henry Nash, and patrician men.\n\nWhen Roosevelt and his men finally land on Cuba, they face ambush, intense enemy fire, and a desperate, outnumbered charge up a defended hill.\n\n\nTom Berenger had starred in \"Gettysburg\" (1993) for Ted Turner and was also a long time admirer of Roosevelt. Berenger pitched the idea of a mini series on the Rough Riders to Turner, giving him an outline, and Turner agreed to finance a four-hour mini series for TNT.\n\n\"I see him as a `force of nature',\" said Berenger, \"a kind of sweet, endearing, enthusiastic and honest man who probably wouldn't make it in politics today. Yet this incident in our history -- largely created by William Randolph Hearst and other yellow press barons -- took him to the White House.\"\n\nBerenger originally intended to play Colonel Leonard Wood, with Stephen Lang to play Roosevelt. Berenger said the mini series \"needs a couple other names.'.. It'll be as much fun as `Gettysburg' was to do ... a bunch of guys playing a famous military unit... The casting director of `Gettysburg' told me she had 6,000 actors' submissions for that production. There were a couple of big names who wanted to do it so badly they said, `Just give me a couple of lines and a uniform - that's all I want.'\" \nHugh Wilson wrote the first draft and planned to direct. Berenger agreed to star and was executive producer.\n\nEventually Wilson bowed out due to creative differences and Berenger suggested he be replaced by John Milius. Milius had long been an admirer of Teddy Roosevelt, and featured him as a character in his film \"The Wind and the Lion\", played by Brian Keith. He had tried to make a film about Roosevelt and the Rough Riders for a number of years but \"nobody cared,\" he said. \"When I would pitch a film about Roosevelt and the Spanish–American War, they wouldn't get it. They would say, 'It's not exactly a Western, and it's not a war picture, so what is it?' I think it's both. The last great Western of the 19th century... [Roosevelt was] an extraordinary character. He makes a really good contrast to the way things are today. He put his money where his mouth was. He was the real thing.\"\n\nAccording to Milius, TNT executives \"said, `We'll let you make it if you can make it at this price, write it quick, be in production in three months'... all these impossible things,\" said Milius. \"And I said yes.\"\n\n\"This one does sort of glorify war,\" said Berenger, who eventually agreed to play Roosevelt. \"But you have to consider that it was written by John Milius.\"\n\n\"In a sense, one man going up that hill, one battle, and a man became President and we acquired an overseas empire,\" said Milius. \"Courage and valor are no longer considered great attributes in our culture. But for Roosevelt, they were the only issues. I agree.\"\n\nMilius says the script was also about the bonding of the men. \"It shows you that things happen to people that they never get over. It's why vets can only talk to each other. Everyone of them is scarred for life... Men go off to war because they really want to, not knowing what it's going to be. They think it's an adventure, a romantic fantasy. And, of course, it never is. People are brought together and forced to do something that is truly unnatural to man – kill each other. But in doing this sort of extraordinary self-destruction, man seems to bring all of his virtues to bear.\"\n\nThe film was shot in Texas over 48 days on a budget of $19 million. \"Believe me, there were no trailers for the stars or anything,\" said Milius. \"If anything, you got a chair.\"\n\n\"I was just pleased I got to do the subject matter; the shorter schedule didn't bother me,\" Milius added. \"It was just another way of telling a story. With the shorter schedule, I just did the best I could do, worked twice as hard and didn't get any sleep.\"\n\nSix Texas locations served as stand-ins for Cuba, Florida, New York and Washington, D.C. - Palestine, a town southeast of Dallas, was the period railroad; the Cuban jungle scenes were done outside Houston and the hill country outside San Antonio stood in for the training camp and San Juan Hill.\n\nMilius considers the film one of his best. \"They had a lot of controls on me, at Turner, and I just ran over them... They hated me, but I got the film made, didn't I?... That's what you have to do. You have to be true to the vision that you start out to do, otherwise what are you even there for?\"\n\nBrian Keith, who played President McKinley, committed suicide after filming and before the mini-series aired.\n\n\nA reviewer for Variety said \"it's not straight history, the name-dropping's something fierce, and fictional characters are mixed liberally with imaginary takes of legendary figures; the first two hours of the four-hour opus are colorful, the second disturbingly corny. \"Rough Riders\" is a rough, sometimes silly, take on extraordinary American history.\"\n\nA reviewer for the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"it rarely manages to surface above a seemingly endless array of skirmishes, firefights, ambushes, infantry charges, hand-to-hand combat, carnage and killing.\"\n\nThe \"Baltimore Sun\" said the film \"overstays its welcome by at least a third... so oozes with testosterone that your TV screen may start sprouting facial hair... Milius gets so caught up in the male bonding, in relishing the way war makes men of boys and brothers of men, that he forgets there's a story to be told. In the end, what could have been a top-notch film about a brief little war, whose lasting import far outweighed its immediate impact, becomes an exercise in the minutiae of battle.\"\n\n\"Rough Riders\" was the most watched basic cable original movie in July, delivering 16 million households over 10 plays.\n\n"}
{"id": "2197947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197947", "title": "Margot Honecker", "text": "Margot Honecker\n\nMargot Honecker (née Feist; 17 April 1927 – 6 May 2016) was an East German politician who was an influential member of that country's Communist regime until 1989. From 1963 until 1989, she was Minister of National Education (\"Ministerin für Volksbildung\") of the GDR. She was married to Erich Honecker, the leader of East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party from 1971 to 1989 and concurrently from 1976 to 1989 the country's head of state. \n\nMargot Honecker was widely known as the \"Purple Witch\" for her tinted hair and hardline Stalinist views, and was described as \"the most hated person\" in East Germany next to Stasi chief Erich Mielke by former Bundestag president Wolfgang Thierse. She was responsible for the enactment of the \"Uniform Socialist Education System\" in 1965 and mandatory military training in schools to prepare pupils for a future war with the west. She was alleged to have been responsible for the regime's forced adoption of children of jailed dissidents or people who attempted to desert from the GDR, and she is considered to have \"left a cruel legacy of separated families.\" She also established prison-like institutions for children, including a camp at Torgau known as \"Margot's concentration camp.\" She was one of the few spouses of a ruling Communist Party leader who held significant power in her own right, as her prominence in the regime predated her husband's ascension to the leadership of the SED.\n\nFollowing the downfall of the communist regime in 1989, Honecker fled to the Soviet Union with her husband to avoid criminal charges from the government of reunified Germany. Fearing extradition to Germany, they took refuge in the Chilean embassy in Moscow in 1991, but in 1992 her husband was extradited to Germany by Yeltsin's Russian government to face criminal trial, and was detained in the Moabit prison. Margot Honecker then fled from Moscow to Chile to avoid a similar fate. At the time of her death, she lived in Chile with her daughter Sonja.\n\nShe left the party in 1990, after her husband's expulsion, and both later became members of the small fringe party Communist Party of Germany (1990), which is considered extremist by the German authorities. Formed in East Berlin in January 1990, the party claims to be the direct successor of the historical party formed in 1918 and is known for its open support for North Korea's communist regime, however it operates only in the territory of the former East Germany.\n\nHonecker was born Margot Feist in Halle on 17 April 1927, the daughter of a shoemaker, Gotthard Feist (1906–1993), and a factory worker, Helene Feist ( 1906–1940). Her parents were members of Communist Party of Germany (KPD). Her father was imprisoned in Lichtenburg concentration camp in the 1930s and from 1937 until 1939 in Buchenwald concentration camp. Gestapo agents searched their apartment for evidence of subversive activities on several occasions. After graduating from elementary school, she was a member of the Nazi Party's girls' organisation Bund Deutscher Mädel from 1938 to 1945, whose membership was obligatory. Her mother died in 1940 when Margot was 13 years old.\n\nHer brother, Manfred Feist, later became the leader of the Foreign Information department within the party's Central Committee.\n\nIn 1945 Margot Feist joined the KPD. After April 1946, with the contentious merger of the SPD and KPD, she became a member of East Germany's next ruling party, the Socialist Unity Party (\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\" / SED), working in Halle as a shorthand typist with the FDGB (Trades Union Federation) regional executive for Saxony-Anhalt.\n\nIn 1946 she also joined the regional secretariat of the Free German Youth (FDJ)—effectively the youth wing of the ruling party—in Halle. She then began a meteoric rise through its various departments. In 1947 she became the leader of the culture and education department in the FDJ's regional executive and in 1948 secretary of the FDJ's central council as well as chairperson of the Ernst Thälmann Pioneer Organisation.\nBy 1949 Feist was a member of the GDR's precursor parliament (). In 1949 at the age of 22 she was elected as a representative in the newly founded People's Chamber ().\n\nMargot Feist met her future husband, Erich Honecker, at FDJ meetings when he was the chairman of the \"Freie Deutsche Jugend\". Honecker was 15 years older and married. The relationship between them nevertheless moved on when Feist in her capacity as leader of the \"Ernst Thälmann young pioneers\", was a member of the delegation that traveled to Moscow for the celebration of Stalin's official birthday. The East German delegation was led by Erich Honecker. After she became pregnant and gave birth to their daughter Sonja in 1952, Honecker divorced his second wife Edith and married Margot.\n\nIn 1963 Honecker became Minister of National Education (), after a period of occupying the office as Acting Minister. On 25 February 1965 she introduced the law that made \"the uniform socialist education system\" standard in all schools, colleges and universities throughout East Germany.\n\nFor her work as Minister of National Education, she was awarded the Order of Karl Marx, the nation's highest award, in 1977.\n\nIn 1978 Honecker introduced, against the opposition of the churches and many parents, military lessons () for 9th and 10th grade high school students (this included training on weapons such as aerial guns and the KK-MPi). Her tenure lasted until early November 1989.\n\nShe was, allegedly but never proven, responsible for the regime's kidnapping and forced adoption of children of jailed dissidents or people who attempted to desert from GDR, and she is considered to have \"left a cruel legacy of separated families.\" Margot dismissed the allegations that she had directed a program of forced adoptions: \"It didn’t exist\". She also established prison-like institutions for children, including a camp at Torgau known as \"Margot's concentration camp.\"\n\nIn 1990, charges were made against Honecker as Minister of Education. These included accusations that she had arranged politically motivated arrests, had separated children against their will from their parents and made compulsory adoptions of children from persons deemed unreliable by the state.\n\nThroughout the Peaceful Revolution of 1989 Honecker briefly remained in office after her husband's ouster as leader of the Socialist Unity Party in October 1989, but was sacked from cabinet on 2 November. On 4 February 1990 she resigned from the Party of Democratic Socialism, successor of the SED; her husband had been expelled two months earlier.\n\nA new arrest warrant against Erich Honecker was issued in December 1990, but there was no immediate arrest. In March 1991, the couple were flown in a Soviet military jet to Moscow from the Sperenberg Airfield near Berlin. As soon as they arrived in Moscow, Margot's husband was taken directly to a Red Army hospital where his cancer was diagnosed. The two of them were then installed in a government dacha and treated as honoured guests, while one by one their Kremlin comrades fell from power. Boris Yeltsin was already busy building up his power base in Moscow, and Erich Honecker's desperate last letter to President Gorbachev went unanswered. As more of the old Soviet certainties collapsed, and fearing that they might find themselves handed over to the German authorities, in August 1991 the Honeckers took refuge in the Chilean embassy, where for nearly a year they lived out of a suitcase in a small room. They hoped to be able to fly directly from Moscow to a Chilean exile, but the German government had other ideas. The Russian leadership refused to become involved: it fell to the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, and the Chilean President, Patricio Aylwin, to negotiate a future for the Honeckers. There was public and political pressure in Germany for the East German leadership to be held accountable for the killings of people attempting to escape over the Berlin Wall between 1961 and 1989, while Chile had itself only recently emerged from dictatorship: Margot's own son in law was just one among several thousand Chilean political dissidents from the Pinochet years who had reason to be grateful to the old East German political establishment that had welcomed them as political exiles during the 1970s and 1980s. Formally, the negotiations between Kohl and Aylwin were defined by tensions between the Chilean determination to uphold the Honeckers' right to political asylum and Germany's legal agreements on extradition: for some months the discussions were characterised by mutual intransigence. In the end, on 29 July 1992, Erich Honecker was sent on a special flight to face trial in Berlin, but his wife did not accompany him. Margot Honecker instead flew to Santiago to join her daughter Sonja and her family, who had been living in Chile since 1990.\n\nAfter 1992 Margot Honecker lived in Santiago, Chile, with her daughter Sonja Yáñez Betancourt, her daughter's Chilean husband Leo Yáñez Betancourt and their son Roberto Yáñez. In January 1993 Erich Honecker's trial back in Berlin, which some felt had by that stage already descended into farce, was cut short because, it was said, of the rapidly deteriorating health of the accused. He left Berlin for the last time on 13 March 1993, bound for Chile. Erich Honecker lived with his wife and daughter, whose own twenty year marriage ended in divorce the year after her parents moved in. He died of liver cancer at the age of 81 years on 29 May 1994 in Santiago. His body was cremated. Margot Honecker is believed to have kept his ashes.\n\nIn 1999, Honecker failed in her legal attempt to sue the German government for €60,300 of property confiscated following reunification. In 2001, her appeal to ECtHR failed. She received a survivor's pension and the old-age pension of the German old-age pension insurance federation of about 1,500 euros, which she regarded as insolently sparse.\n\nIn 2000, Luis Corvalán, the former General Secretary of the Communist Party of Chile, published the book \"The Other Germany – the GDR. Discussions with Margot Honecker\", in which Honecker speaks about the history of the GDR from her perspective.\n\nOn 19 July 2008, on the occasion of the 29th anniversary of the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua, Honecker received the order for cultural independence \"Rubén Dario\" from President Daniel Ortega. The award was in recognition of Honecker's untiring support of the national campaign against illiteracy in the 1980s. This honor was Honecker's first public appearance since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Honecker was reported to have said she was grateful for the honor; but publicly no words were spoken. The left-wing heads of state of Paraguay and Venezuela, Fernando Lugo and Hugo Chávez, also took part in the celebrations in Managua.\n\nTo the day she died, Honecker continued to defend the old East Germany and identified herself as a hardline Communist. In October 2009, Honecker celebrated the 60th anniversary of the founding of the GDR with former Chilean exiles who had sought asylum in East Germany. She participated in singing a patriotic East German song and gave a short speech in which she stated that East Germans \"had a good life in the GDR\" and that many felt that capitalism has made their lives worse. In 2011, author Frank Schuhmann published a book entitled \"Letzte Aufzeichnungen – Für Margot\" (\"Final Notes – For Margot\" in English) based on the 400-page diary kept by Erich Honecker during his stay in Berlin's Moabit prison beginning in July 1992. The diary was given to the author by Margot Honecker.\n\nOn 2 April 2012, Honecker gave an interview where she defended the GDR, attacked those who helped to \"destroy\" it, and complained about her pension. She felt that there was no need for people to climb over the Berlin Wall and lose their lives. She suggested that the GDR was a good country and that the demonstrations were driven by the GDR's enemies. \"The GDR also had its foes. That's why we had the Stasi,\" she said.\n\nIn a 2012 interview she branded Mikhail Gorbachev a \"traitor\" for his reforms and called the victims of the East German regime \"criminals.\"\n\nMargot Honecker died in Santiago on 6 May 2016, at the age of 89. On her death the historian Hubertus Knabe, director of the Berlin-Hohenschönhausen Memorial, said that \"she never critically reflected on what she had done. Up until her death she was an evil, unrepentant woman.\" Her funeral was described by German media as \"bizarre\" and featuring 50 \"diehard\" communists with East German flags. Victims associations and Roland Jahn, Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records, criticised the funeral.\n\n"}

She also represented Venezuela at Miss Universe 2005 in Bangkok, Thailand where she finished as 4th runner-up.\n\nDuring the Miss Venezuela 2004 pageant, Spear won the national crown and represented Venezuela at Miss Universe 2005 in Thailand.\n\nSpear made the top 15 after Ana Karina Áñez (Miss Venezuela 2003) failed to make the top 15 in Miss Universe 2004, which was the first time in 22 years that Venezuela failed to place. Spear went on to place in the Top 5 after the evening gown and swimsuit competitions. During the final question round, she stumbled while answering the question given by Miss Mexico, Laura Elizondo, and eventually finished as 4th runner-up.\n\nMónica Spear Mootz was born to Rafael Spear Tudares and Ingeborg Mootz Gotera. Her maternal family emigrated from Germany, and her paternal family has English ancestry.\n\nThe Spear–Mootz family moved to Orlando, Florida in 2000 after her mother, Ingeborg, retired from her job with an oil company in Venezuela. Her father, Rafael, is a project engineer at Siemens Westinghouse. Prior to being named the \"fifth most beautiful woman in the universe,\" Spear completed a bachelor's degree in theater from the University of Central Florida before returning to Venezuela to compete in the national pageant. Her participation in Miss Venezuela garnered notoriety when she was asked during the traditional \"breakfast with press\" the day after the pageant, because of her degree, which Venezuelan playwright she liked the most, to which she answered, \"Gabriel García Márquez\", a Colombian writer. She crowned her Miss Venezuela successor, Jictzad Viña, on 15 September 2005.\n\nSpear married a British businessman, Thomas Henry Berry (whose nationality was later misidentified as Irish) in June 2008. She gave birth to a daughter later that year. The couple divorced in 2012, but remained friendly, and at the time of their death they were attempting to reconcile. She was a naturalized United States citizen, resident in Miami, Florida. She is a cousin of Jossie Nikita Marques Spear, a Venezuelan model. Spear was fluent in Spanish, English and French.\n\nAfter modeling, Mother Agency Mariela Centeno, Spear became one of the most successful actresses in Venezuela for her main roles in telenovelas. Her first role as a protagonist was in the RCTV telenovela \"Mi Prima Ciela\" (\"My Cousin Ciela\"), in which she played a high-school student battling leukemia. The show was a success in Venezuela and other parts of South America, and it was televised in the US by TeleFutura. Spear held the starring role in Venevisión's telenovela \"La Mujer Perfecta\" in 2010, and recently had a lead role in \"Flor Salvaje\"; a Spanish-language telenovela produced by the Miami-based television network Telemundo and RTI Producciones. She had lived in Miami since she began working for Telemundo.\n\nVenezuelan channel Venevisión broadcast\" La Mujer Perfecta\" in honor of Spear and a foundation aid for people with Asperger syndrome. Same television special will Mónica Spear, led by the former Miss Venezuela, cheerleader and actress Mariangel Ruiz.\n\nOn 6 January 2014, Spear was in her native Venezuela on vacation with her ex-husband and their five-year-old daughter. On a highway in central Carabobo, when the three were inside their car waiting for assistance after the vehicle had broken down, Spear and her ex-husband were killed during an attempted robbery and their daughter shot and wounded in the leg. The police reported that the incident occurred around 9 or 10 p.m. It has been theorized that the thieves tried to rob them and the couple resisted.\n\nOn the initial suggestion that her former husband was Irish, the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs was investigating the incident. However, local police said he was travelling on a British passport. The international media also highlighted the rising rate of crime in Venezuela.\n\nOn 8 January 2014, seven people were arrested by the Cuerpo de Investigaciones Científicas, Penales y Criminalísticas (CICPC) for their alleged involvement in the murder. The suspects were José Ferreira Herrera (18), Jean Carlos Colina (19), Nelfrend Jiménez Álvarez (21), Alejandro Maldonado Pérez (21), Franklin Cordero Álvarez (28), Leonar Marcano Lugo (32) and Eva Armas Mejías (39). At the time of the arrest, the Venezuelan authorities also confiscated several items believed to have been owned by Spear and Berry.\n\nSpear's daughter has been in the care of her grandparents since her parents' death. Nicolás Maduro, the President of Venezuela, provided a private jet to fly Spear's parents from Florida to Venezuela so they could be with their granddaughter.\n\nAfter two years, six of the people that were involved in their murder have received sentences. Three men were each sentenced to more than 30 years in prison. Eva Armas Mejias received a 10-year sentence because she was found to be the accomplice. Four other people involved received sentences between 24 and 26 years for the murder of Monica Spear and her ex-husband.\n\n\n"}

It was a spin-off of \"Walker, Texas Ranger\".\n\nAs of March 2020, it is currently airing in syndication on getTV.\n\nThe two-hour pilot, \"Sons of Thunder\", was shown as episode 4.24 of \"Walker\". This episode introduced the characters of childhood friends Carlos Sandoval, a Dallas PD Detective, and Trent Malloy, an Army sergeant and a protégé of Walker.\n\nWhen Rev. Thunder Malloy, a close friend of Walker, dies from a heart attack, his son Trent returns home and, eventually, quits the Army to stay. Walker and his partner Trivette go after a serial cop killer who has Carlos on his list, which Trent ends up getting involved in by accident when he saved Carlos' life and later helped Walker and Carlos take down the criminal.\n\nDuring Seasons 5 and 6 of \"Walker\", Carlos appeared on 15 episodes and Trent for 12 episodes (one of these episodes included a Hayes Cooper story in which both actors appeared in a dual role). During these episodes, Trent opens his own martial arts dojo as well as a protection agency to either help people who are too scared to go to the police or who the police can't help. Sometimes he has Carlos assist him in some of his cases and at other times they help Walker on several of his cases, which often involve personal issues, or Trent turns over his current case\n\nFinally, in 1999, they got their own spin-off series, which only lasted six episodes. Carlos resigns from the PD after his partner is murdered by a serial killer, who was a failed police applicant. He teams up with Trent to find the assassin and they later decide to form their own private investigation firm called Thunder Investigation.\n\n\"Sons of Thunder\" was not picked up for the fall 1999 CBS line-up. While replacing \"Walker, Texas Ranger\" (which was on hiatus) in the 8 o'clock Saturday night time slot, the show beat \"Walker\"'s ratings of the previous two seasons. Producers Chuck and Aaron Norris assumed that the show would be given a season's full of episodes to try to make it on to the CBS line-up. But CBS passed on the show citing budget concerns.\n\n\n"}

It weighs 30,000 kg (66,000 lb) and is 3.7 m (12 feet) wide. From 2000 until 2006, it was the largest swinging bell in the world. It was dedicated on December 31, 1999, and was first swung as the year 2000 opened. In keeping with its theme of world peace, the bell features an inscription commemorating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and engravings marking important events from the past 1,000 years.\n\nThe plan in 1997 was to cast the bell near Newport, Kentucky, in an on-site foundry. The bell would have hung in a Millennium Monument tower to open on New Year's Eve 1999, with an 85-bell carillon featuring this bell as its largest. At first the bell was called \"The Millennium Bell.\" Later the plans were reduced to a smaller tower for the bell with an accompanying museum.\n\nThe Verdin Company managed the project on the U.S. side on behalf of the Millennium Monument Company. On December 11, 1998, the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the bell was cast on the premises of a ship propeller foundry in Nantes, France, under the strict supervision of staff from French bellfounders Fonderie Paccard of Annecy. The mastermind behind this bell was veteran bellfounder Pierre Paccard who accomplished this mammoth feat together with his sons, Philippe and Cyril Paccard, under the close collaboration of Master Founder Miguel Lopez.\n\nThe World Peace Bell was first rung in Nantes on March 20, 1999, in a public ceremony. It then underwent a month-and-a-half-long sea voyage from France to the U.S. port of New Orleans, Louisiana, where the bell was made part of that city's Fourth of July celebration. The bell was then transported by barge up the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, making stops in 14 cities along the way and arriving at its final destination in northern Kentucky on August 1. Its arrival coincided with the 1999 Tall Stacks Festival, held along the Cincinnati-Covington-Newport section of the Ohio River. This event was named the nation's \"Top Tourism Event\" by the American Bus Association in 1999.\n\nFor the first time in the U.S., the bell was rung by swinging on January 1, 2000, at midnight. Struck twelve times, its peal was heard for distances of about . At present, the bell is swung on special occasions, as well as daily at five minutes before noon. The time difference in the daily ring is to avoid interference with the nearby courthouse bells, which ring exactly at noon.\n\nThe striker, which chimes the bell on the hour, is of cast iron and was produced at Cast-Fab Technologies, Inc., in Cincinnati, Ohio. A special iron was used to prevent the striker from damaging the bell when it hits the outside rim of the bell (see right side of photo). The striker allows the bell to be chimed without swinging it.\n\nThe bell tower, the bridge linking the museum and the bell, and most of the other components of the Millennium Monument, were produced at companies local to the Newport, Kentucky, area. The World Peace Bell Center is located at 425 York Street, Newport, Kentucky, 41071, USA.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2198011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198011", "title": "Bruce Woodley", "text": "Bruce Woodley\n\nBruce William Woodley, (born 25 July 1942), is an Australian singer-songwriter and musician. He was a founding member of the successful pop-folk group The Seekers, and co-composer of the song \"I Am Australian\". Woodley attended Melbourne High School with fellow Seekers, Athol Guy and Keith Potger.\n\nWoodley had a 'residency' performing at the Treble Clef restaurant in Prahran. With former schoolmates, Athol Guy and Keith Potger, he formed a folk music trio, The Escorts, in the early 1960s. Soon before the arrival of vocalist Judith Durham in 1962 they became The Seekers, and had some success in Australia before travelling to London in 1964 and recording four international hit singles written and produced by Tom Springfield. Woodley played guitar, banjo, and mandolin, as well as one of the four-part vocal harmony, and was the chief songwriter. While Durham sang the majority of lead vocals for the group, Woodley usually handled the male lead vocals, including a number of album tracks. The Seekers first disbanded in 1968.\n\nDuring 1965, while in London, Woodley met Paul Simon, following the poor performance of Wednesday Morning 3 A.M. and just prior to the success of Simon and Garfunkel. Simon and Woodley co-wrote the million-selling \"Red Rubber Ball\"—later a Top Five hit for US group The Cyrkle. The Simon and Woodley collaboration also provided \"I Wish You Could Be Here\" and \"Cloudy\". The Seekers later recorded these three songs, and \"Cloudy\" became an album track on Simon and Garfunkel's hit 1966 album \"Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme\"—the only Simon and Woodley song to appear on both groups' album. However, Woodley's relationship with Simon had deteriorated and Woodley later struggled to get his share of the royalties—his songwriting credit on \"Cloudy\" was omitted from the release of \"Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme\". However, Simon does receive a credit for the song on The Seekers' album, \"Seekers Seen in Green\".\n\nWoodley's first solo venture was a production company called Pennywheel, which saw him release a number of products for children, including a \"Build an Alphabet\" set of blocks and the 1969 EP and board book, \"Friday St. Fantasy\". In 1969, Bruce headed off to America to sell the songs he'd been writing, and was to remain there for several years. During this period he collaborated with a number of writers including John Farrar and Australian folk singer Hans Poulsen. Their compositions \"Lady Scorpio\" performed by Australian band The Strangers, \"Monty and Me\" performed by Zoot (which included a young Rick Springfield) and \"Boom-Sha-La-La-Lo\" which became a hit for Poulsen.\n\nIn 1971, Woodley released his first solo album, entitled \"Just Good Friends\". In a reaction to the folk stereotype of the Seekers, the original album cover featured two naked models having sex. This was deemed too raunchy for Australia and the cover was replaced by a photo of Woodley. The original cover, however, was allowed in New Zealand, and this version of the album is a collectors item today. Three years later, Woodley contributed to an Australian-themed album put out by Viscount cigarettes, called \"The Roaring Days Vol. 1\" (after a Henry Lawson poem). A second volume never eventuated. He also had a hit song called \"Love Me Tonight Baby\". The album featured Bruce performing the traditional folk song \"Eumerella Shore\" and some of his own compositions, including \"The Bush Girl\", which he would later re-record for a double album in 1987, with The Seekers in 1997 and 2000, and with daughter Claire Woodley in 2001.\n\nWoodley reunited with the Seekers, composed of fellow original members Athol Guy and Keith Potger, and 23-year-old Dutch-born Louisa Wisseling (a semi-professional folk singer formerly with Melbourne band The Settlers). In a February 1975 newspaper article about the group's reunion, Louisa revealed that Bruce had approached her at a 1974 Settlers concert at Ferntree Gully's Swagman Restaurant with an offer to join the group, and she originally turned him down. The new group recorded two albums and a number of singles, some of which, like \"The Nimble Song\" and \"I Saw It All With Trans Tours\" (both written by Woodley) reflected the boys' other careers in advertising. Woodley's composition \"The Sparrow Song\" became the group's biggest 1970s hit and remains to this day the highest-charting Seekers single written by a member of the group. Other tracks he contributed to this line-up included \"Giving and Takin'\" (the title track of their second album), \"Can We Learn to Get Along\" (which began life as a solo recording for the TV documentary series \"Shell's Australia\", and was released by Bruce on flexi-disc), \"Reunion\", \"Country Ros\", \"Standing on Shaky Ground\" (featuring Bruce on vocals which he felt were too low for him, but were impossible for Louisa to sing for the same reason), and \"The Rose and the Briar\".\n\nIn 1977, Bruce left the group and was replaced by Buddy England. He continued to focus on song-writing and advertising, producing many TV jingles including one for Courage beer. His first, back in 1971 was a solo (advertising) single called \"The ANZ Bank Travelling Man\", and was given out free to employees of that institution as part of the promotion.\n\nThe year 1987 saw Woodley involved in the preparations for the Australian Bicentenary, and the release of an Australian-themed double album, songbook and cassette tape, featuring covers of traditional songs and some of Woodley's own compositions. The set was called \"I Am Australian\", after a jingle that he wrote to tie together the various threads of the project, tapping into the need he perceived for a national song in which people could take pride. One of his colleagues on the project was Dobe Newton of The Bushwackers, who helped compose the words of the title song; another was noted folk singer Rose Bygrave. The recordings also featured a children's choir including Claire Woodley.\n\nThe following year he reunited with The Seekers, this time featuring Julie Anthony as the lead singer, to perform \"The Carnival is Over\" at Expo '88 and a musical about the Seekers' journey. This line-up released an album in 1989; \"Live On\", the title track, was composed by Woodley, as were many of the other new tracks like \"The Streets of Serenade\" (which charted the story of the Seekers rather more blatantly than his '70s composition \"Reunion\"), \"One Step Forward, Two Steps Back\", \"How Can a Love So Wrong Be So Right\" and \"Taking My Chances With You\". When Julie left to have a baby (daughter Tamara), former \"Young Talent Time\" singer Karen Knowles joined the group. The only studio recordings by this line-up are the Bruce Woodley written songs \"Fools Tonight\" and \"Bright Star\", sold as a cassingle at concerts. \"Bright Star\", originally written for Julie's voice, was also performed by both the Julie- and Karen-led Seekers at Carols by Candlelight.\n\nWhen original lead singer Judith Durham returned to The Seekers fold in late 1992 for the group's 25 Year Silver Jubilee, the theme song and CD-Single of the reunion was Woodley's composition \"Keep A Dream In Your Pocket\". A 1993 live album and DVD followed, featuring many of the group's hits and a song which would become one of their best known, Woodley's \"I Am Australian\".\n\nThe success of \"I Am Australian\" took Woodley completely by surprise. In 1991, he performed it with Karen and the Australian Children's Choir on a televised drought appeal, featuring a new, drought themed verse which has not appeared on other recordings. \"I Am Australian\" has featured in all Woodley's solo tours and all Seekers tours since the reunion with Judith Durham; in 2000 the Seekers performed a condensed version at the televised Australia Day concert. Many artists have covered the song; in 1997, Durham released a version with Russell Hitchcock and Mandawuy Yunupingu which entered the Australian charts. For many , it has become the unofficial anthem, and is a staple performed at many national events, by such artists as Jon Stevens, Delta Goodrem and naturally Bruce and the Seekers. At the 2001 celebrations for the Centenary of Federation, Woodley performed the song with daughter Claire (now known for performing the song solo at many events herself) and co-writer Dobe Newton.\n\nWoodley divorced in the '80s after a 14-year marriage, and he and former wife Sally have two children, Claire and a son, Dan. With Claire, a burgeoning singer-songwriter in her own right who has performed on the cabaret and conference circuit, he recorded a CD in 2001 called, once again, \"I am Australian\". He has since recorded an ANZAC themed version of \"I am Australian\", titled \"The Anzac Song\", and appeared on Melbourne radio advertising the release of a CD-Single several weeks before Anzac Day in 2005. Apparently due to production difficulties, it never eventuated. In 2005 Bruce was interviewed by music journalist Debbie Kruger for a new book entitled \"Songwriters Speak\", focusing on influential and successful Australian singer-songwriters.\n\nAt the National Day of Mourning on 22 February 2009 for the victims of the Victoria bushfires, Woodley unveiled two new verses for \"I am Australian\".\n\nWoodley's non-musical work includes public speaking through the Saxton Speakers Bureau, and he is the patron of various organisations such as the NIYPAA (National Institute of Youth Performing Arts Australia). He is also a member of the Advisory Board of the organisation TLC for Kids, and was for a time, beginning in 1997, the chairman of the Victorian branch of the Variety Club.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2198016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198016", "title": "Zeta function universality", "text": "Zeta function universality\n\nIn mathematics, the universality of zeta-functions is the remarkable ability of the Riemann zeta-function and other similar functions (such as the Dirichlet L-functions) to approximate arbitrary non-vanishing holomorphic functions arbitrarily well.\n\nThe universality of the Riemann zeta function was first proven by Sergei Mikhailovitch Voronin in 1975 and is sometimes known as Voronin's Universality Theorem.\n\nA mathematically precise statement of universality for the Riemann zeta-function ζ(\"s\") follows.\n\nLet \"U\" be a compact subset of the strip\n\nsuch that the complement of \"U\" is connected. Let be a continuous function on \"U\" which is holomorphic on the interior of \"U\" and does not have any zeros in \"U\". Then for any there exists a such that\nfor all formula_2.\n\nEven more: the lower density of the set of values \"t\" which do the job is positive, as is expressed by the following inequality about a limit inferior.\n\nwhere \"λ\" denotes the Lebesgue measure on the real numbers.\n\nThe condition that the complement of \"U\" be connected essentially means that \"U\" doesn't contain any holes.\n\nThe intuitive meaning of the first statement is as follows: it is possible to move \"U\" by some vertical displacement \"it\" so that the function \"f\" on \"U\" is approximated by the zeta function on the displaced copy of \"U\", to an accuracy of ε.\n\nThe function \"f\" is not allowed to have any zeros on \"U\". This is an important restriction; if you start with a holomorphic function with an isolated zero, then any \"nearby\" holomorphic function will also have a zero. According to the Riemann hypothesis, the Riemann zeta function does not have any zeros in the considered strip, and so it couldn't possibly approximate such a function. The function which is identically zero on \"U\" can be approximated by \"ζ\": we can first pick the \"nearby\" function (which is holomorphic and doesn't have zeros) and find a vertical displacement such that \"ζ\" approximates \"g\" to accuracy \"ε\"/2, and therefore \"f\" to accuracy \"ε\".\n\nThe accompanying figure shows the zeta function on a representative part of the relevant strip. The color of the point \"s\" encodes the value \"ζ\"(\"s\") as follows: the hue represents the argument of \"ζ\"(\"s\"), with red denoting positive real values, and then counterclockwise through yellow, green cyan, blue and purple. Strong colors denote values close to 0 (black = 0), weak colors denote values far away from 0 (white = ∞). The picture shows three zeros of the zeta function, at about , and . Voronin's theorem essentially states that this strip contains all possible \"analytic\" color patterns that don't use black or white.\n\nThe rough meaning of the statement on the lower density is as follows: if a function \"f\" and an is given, there is a positive probability that a randomly picked vertical displacement \"it\" will yield an approximation of \"f\" to accuracy \"ε\".\n\nThe interior of \"U\" may be empty, in which case there is no requirement of \"f\" being holomorphic. For example, if we take \"U\" to be a line segment, then a continuous function is nothing but a curve in the complex plane, and we see that the zeta function encodes every possible curve (i.e., any figure that can be drawn without lifting the pencil) to arbitrary precision on the considered strip.\n\nThe theorem as stated applies only to regions \"U\" that are contained in the strip. However, if we allow translations and scalings, we can also find encoded in the zeta functions approximate versions of all non-vanishing holomorphic functions defined on other regions. In particular, since the zeta function itself is holomorphic, versions of itself are encoded within it at different scales, the hallmark of a fractal.\n\nThe surprising nature of the theorem may be summarized in this way: the Riemann zeta function contains \"all possible behaviors\" within it, and is thus \"chaotic\" in a sense, yet it is a perfectly smooth analytic function with a rather simple, straightforward definition.\n\nA sketch of the proof presented in (Voronin and Karatsuba, 1992) follows.\nWe consider only the case where \"U\" is a disk centered at 3/4:\nand we will argue that every non-zero holomorphic function defined on \"U\" can be approximated by the \"ζ\"-function on a vertical translation of this set.\n\nPassing to the logarithm, it is enough to show that for every holomorphic function and every there exists a real number \"t\" such that\n\nWe will first approximate \"g\"(\"s\") with the logarithm of certain finite products reminiscent of the Euler product for the \"ζ\"-function:\nwhere P denotes the set of all primes.\n\nIf formula_7 is a sequence of real numbers, one for each prime \"p\", and \"M\" is a finite set of primes, we set\n\nWe consider the specific sequence\nand claim that \"g\"(\"s\") can be approximated by a function of the form formula_10 for a suitable set \"M\" of primes. The proof of this claim utilizes the Bergman space, falsely named Hardy space in (Voronin and Karatsuba, 1992), in \"H\" of holomorphic functions defined on \"U\", a Hilbert space. We set\nwhere \"p\" denotes the \"k\"-th prime number. It can then be shown that the series\nis conditionally convergent in \"H\", i.e. for every element \"v\" of \"H\" there exists a rearrangement of the series\nwhich converges in \"H\" to \"v\". This argument uses a theorem that generalizes the Riemann series theorem to a Hilbert space setting. Because of a relationship between the norm in \"H\" and the maximum absolute value of a function, we can then approximate our given function \"g\"(\"s\") with an initial segment of this rearranged series, as required.\n\nBy a version of the Kronecker theorem, applied to the real numbers formula_13 (which are linearly independent over the rationals)\nwe can find real values of \"t\" so that formula_10 is approximated by formula_15. Further, for some of these values \"t\", formula_15 approximates formula_17, finishing the proof.\n\nThe theorem is stated without proof in § 11.11 of (Titchmarsh and Heath-Brown, 1986),\nthe second edition of a 1951 monograph by Titchmarsh; and a weaker result is given in Thm. 11.9. Although Voronin's theorem is not proved there, two corollaries are derived from it:\n<br>\n\nSome recent work has focused on \"effective\" universality.\nUnder the conditions stated at the beginning of this article, there exist values of \"t\" that satisfy inequality (1).\nAn \"effective\" universality theorem places an upper bound on the smallest such \"t\".\n\nFor example, in 2003, Garunkštis proved that if formula_26 is analytic in formula_27 with\nformula_28, then for any ε in formula_29, there exists a number formula_30 in formula_31 such that\nFor example, if formula_33, then the bound for \"t\" is formula_34.\n\nBounds can also be obtained on the measure of these \"t\" values, in terms of ε:\nFor example, if formula_33, then the right-hand side is formula_37.\nSee.\n\nWork has been done showing that universality extends to Selberg zeta functions\nThe Dirichlet L-functions show not only universality, but a certain kind of joint universality that allow any set of functions to be approximated by the same value(s) of \"t\" in different \"L\"-functions, where each function to be approximated is paired with a different \"L\"-function.\nA similar universality property has been shown for the Lerch zeta function formula_38, at least when the parameter \"α\" is a transcendental number.\n\nSections of the Lerch zeta-function have also been shown to have a form of joint universality.\n\n"}

Muhammad ibn Tughj al-Ikhshid, a Turkic mamluk soldier, was appointed governor by the Abbasid Caliph. The dynasty carried the Arabic title \"Wāli\" reflecting their position as governors on behalf of the Abbasids. The Ikhshidids came to an end when the Fatimid army conquered Fustat in 969.\n\nThe creation of the Ikhshidid state was part of the wider disintegration and decentralisation of the Abbasids after the Anarchy at Samarra, whereupon government became more decentralised. The founder, Muhammad ibn Tughj al-Ikhshid, possessed some form of military power and was on friendly relations with Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, a powerful military leader. Before he was appointed to Fustat he held the post of governor of Damascus. He was first appointed to the post of Governor of Egypt in 933 but did not enter it during the first stint. In 935 he was appointed a second time to the governorship whilst the country was in a state of war with multiple factions. He launched a campaign to conquer Egypt by land and sea, the naval forces taking Tinnis and able to outflank Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh, the main opponent, forcing his retreat and facilitating ibn Tughj's subsequent entry to Fustat in August.\nThe Fatimids were a major threat at the time and considerable effort was put into repelling them, culminating in their defeat by Ubayd Allah, ibn Tughj's brother, by November 936. There was remarkable stability in the early years, with an absence of economic chaos and Bedouin raids, coupled with prohibition of looting, which helped pacify Egypt. Ibn Tughj sought the honorific title (laqab) of Al-Ikhshīd, which means \"King of the Farghanians\", from the Abbasids and official designation arrived in July 939.\n\nMuhammad ibn Ra'iq took over Syria in 939, which threatened Egypt. Enraged, ibn Tughj threatened to recognise the Fatimids, the Abbasids' enemy as the Abbasid caliph did not formally declare for ibn Tughj, the de jure governor. Nonetheless, his simple goals resulted in mainly defensive actions and eventually came to terms with ibn Ra'iq where ibn Tughj would continue to have Egypt and the same for ibn Ra'iq in Syria, partitioned along Ramla-Tiberias. In 944 ibn Tughj was awarded the governorships of Egypt, Syria and Hijaz for 30 years to his family, and these posts would past to his son, Abu'l-Qasim. Earlier in 942 he began striking coins in his own name, and the changes of power in Baghdad meant less central authority. In 945 he defeated Sayf al-Dawla, another adversary who took over Damascus, which resulted in a truce until his death in 946. Abu'l-Qasim inherited the conflict with Sayf al-Dawla and fought him at Damascus, and al-Dawla soon occupied Aleppo in 947. There was a simultaneous revolt by Ghabun, governor of Middle Egypt who managed to occupy Fustat before his death in the same year. Nonetheless, Kafur's continuation of the appeasement policy managed to negotiate a settlement between the Ikhshidids and the Hamdanids where Damascus became Egyptian again and the tribute to the Hamdanids stopped, with borders largely in line with \"status quo ante bellum\". This peace practically settled the Ikhshidid borders and left the Fatimids, again as the main threat, with the Byzantines now Hamdanid responsibility. Kafur wielded real authority following ibn Tughj's death in 946 and was highly regarded among contemporaries.\n\nNubian incursions occurred in 950 and a more serious invasion took place in 965, when Aswan was pillaged. This coincided with the famine of 963-968 while Berbers, Bedouins and Qarmatians all took advantage of the weakened state. In 966 Kafur took over after Abu'l-Hasan's death, which furthered increased uncertainty due to his status as a eunuch. Nonetheless he received the title 'Ustādh,' meaning \"master,\" from Baghdad, which gave him some legitimacy. Ibn Killis, Kafur's vizier, was arrested following Kafur's death in 968 and following his release traveled to Fatimid Ifriqiya and provided vital information to them. In 934 a Fatimid invasion led by the eunuch Raydan managed to capture Alexandria but was repulsed. Only a later attempt by the Fatimid general Jawhar al-Siqillimanaged to conquer Egypt in 969. Ubayd Allah, brother of Muhammad ibn Tughj, held out in Syria until March 970, when he was defeated and taken prisoner by Ja'far ibn Fallah, signalling the end of the Ikhshidid dynasty as a ruling power.\n\n\nLike the Fatimids after them, the Ikhshidids made use of Black slave troops. The practice began with the Tulunids in 870 AD where the Africans were used as infantrymen, which was continued by the Ikhshidids due to financial reasons, as they were cheaper than Turkish military slaves which were used as cavalry.\n\nOnly gold coins are common, with coppers being extremely rare. Dinars were mainly struck at Misr (Fustat) and Filastin (al-Ramla), and dirhams were usually struck at Filastin, and less often at Tabariya, Dimashq, and Hims. Other mints for dirhams are quite rare. Dinars from Misr are often well struck, while the Filastin dinars are more crude. Dirhams are usually crudely struck and often are illegible on half of the coin.\n\n\n"}

The Ikhshids of Soghdia, with their capital at Samarkand, are well attested during and after the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana. The line survived into Abbasid times, although by then its seat was in Istikhan. Among the most notable and energetic of the Soghdian kings was Gurak, who in 710 overthrew his predecessor Tarkhun and for almost thirty years, through shifting alliances, managed to preserve a precarious autonomy between the expanding Umayyad Caliphate and the Türgesh khaganate.

It is a multilingual, multicultural area that consists of one- and two-story buildings often painted in pastel shades and is home to roughly five hundred toy- and electronics-related businesses.\n\nBefore the arrival of the first toy merchants, the area was considered to be part simply of a Los Angeles skid row – an impoverished area habituated by the homeless – and one contemporary account described it as lying between Third, Fifth and Main streets and the Los Angeles River. Taiwanese and Vietnamese immigrants of Chinese descent opened up the first toy stores in the early 1980s, and at first these merchants sold toys only during holiday periods. Among them was the Woo family, and the most successful entrepreneur of that clan was Charles Woo, born in Hong Kong and settling in Los Angeles as a teenager in 1968. Woo was a physics student at UCLA when he took a summer off to help other family members launch ABC Toys, a wholesale business later operated by Shu Woo. By 1998 Woo and his family owned 10 Toy District buildings and a distribution company, Mega Toys, with $30 million in annual sales. Charles Woo was later considered to be the Toy District's \"founding father.\" Woo said he built up the Toy District by encouraging other Asian-immigrant entrepreneurs who were buying toys from him to open their own businesses in the district.\n\nPredominantly a wholesale district for mid-range to low-end stores nationwide, the 12-block area is also popular with individual bargain hunters. About a thousand shops, stalls and curbside stands fill the bustling area, roughly bounded by 3rd Street on the north, San Pedro Street on the east, 5th Street on the south and Los Angeles Street on the west. Along with toys, the shops are filled with housewares, sporting goods, silk flowers and clothing imported from such places as Thailand and Pakistan as well as China. Ninety percent of the stores sell at wholesale prices. Charles Woo said that he built up volume in his business by halving the 40 to 50 percent markup typically sought by traditional small toy wholesalers.\n\nThe growth of the toy industry in this area helped revive these economically stricken areas of Downtown Los Angeles, and the process gave birth to the Toy District, which by 2003 was home to hundreds of resellers of mostly Asian-made toys and other goods, with more than a billion dollars in sales each year. Los Angeles County has emerged as the gateway to most of the toys sold in U.S. retail stores and increasingly abroad. More than five hundred companies make up the toy industry in the county – not only in the Toy District – and they are mainly wholesalers who import dolls, radio-controlled cars and other goods from Pacific Rim countries. They generally are small, and they employ few workers each.\n\nAround 1998, a business improvement district, or BID, was established by property owners in the neighborhood to clean streets and improve security, but by 2009 there was widespread discontent among the owners about the role of the district, which had been paying for trash pickup and security patrols through special assessments on the properties. The Central City East Association, the nonprofit organization that managed the district, had been trying to husband the district's dwindling funds so a street-trash problem grew worse. The district went out of business in 2009 when property owners defeated a proposal to renew its mandate. On January 1, 2010, the Central City East Association stopped providing trash removal and other services in the Toy District. Even before that date, cardboard boxes and other garbage began to pile up on neighborhood streets. Workers from the BID had regularly hauled more than five tons of garbage daily from the area. Many landlords cited the poor economy and a dip in the rental market, saying they could not afford the BID's annual dues, which ranged from a few hundred to more than one hundred thousand dollars.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the trash problem. Stores received large shipments of merchandise, and some business owners dumped the packing materials on the streets at the end of each day, assuming the city would take care of it. Additionally, many of the district's cramped shops were housed in larger, subdivided storefronts and they did not have ready access to alleys or other areas large enough to hold dumpsters.\n\nThe district is also home to a portion of downtown's homeless population, with homeless people sleeping at night on the sidewalks. By 2010 street lights had been stripped of salable metal parts and entire blocks were left in darkness.\n"}
{"id": "2198072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198072", "title": "Francisco Bustamante", "text": "Francisco Bustamante\n\nFrancisco Bustamante (born December 29, 1963, Philippines) is a Filipino professional pocket billiards (pool) player from Tarlac, Central Luzon and the 2010 World Nine-ball Champion, nicknamed \"Django\", after the lead character of the film of the same name, and sometimes also called \"Bustie\", especially in the United States.\n\nBustamante is the youngest of eight siblings. People in his vicinity nicknamed him \"Django\" because of his scrappy nature and the way he often appeared with a cigarette in his mouth reminded them of the movie character of that name. The character was portrayed by an Italian actor. Their father made a living through building toilets and planting rice, and Bustamante engaged himself in the activities also. His life in pool began when he worked in his sister's pool hall, racking and spotting balls on the tables. When the patrons left and the place closed for the night, the young Bustamante would grab a stick and practice alone.\n\nHe never completed high school and has been concentrating in pocket billiards from 10 \nyears of age. He quoted:\n\nAfter some success in the Philippines, Bustamante moved to Germany where he stayed for more than a decade, competing in a number of tournaments in Europe.\n\nBustamante has been playing since the age of ten, and has won titles such as the Munich Masters, the German Nine-ball Championship, and the Japan Nine-ball Championship, making him one of billiards' greatest international stars.\n\nWith his win in Tulsa, Bustamante locked up the 1998 Camel Pro Billiards Series year-long point fund's top spot. He then finished the season in record-breaking style, winning the Columbus 10-Ball Open and becoming the first player to win three Camel titles in one season. His Columbus 10-Ball title also completed the first ever Camel trifecta, with titles in each of the three games contested on the Camel Pro Billiards Series: eight-ball, nine-ball and ten-ball. Known for his style at the table and behind-the-back shots, Bustamante is one of the best Filipino players of the game along with fellow Kapampangan Efren Reyes, Marlon Manalo and Ronato Alcano. He also holds the world record for having the most powerful break shot.\n\nIn 1999, Bustamante finished 3rd place in the WPA World Nine-ball Championship after losing to Efren Reyes, who later won it. Months later, he won the International Challenge of Champions. He won that tournament again three years later.\n\nThe next year, Bustamante won the Motolite 9-ball Tournament, an event held in the Philippines, at the expense of Antonio Lining. The victory earned him $30K, which was the largest first prize offered in a Philippine-held tournament at that time (this was later surpassed when Alcano won $100K in the 2006 WPA World Nine-ball Championship, which was held in that country).\n\nThe year 2002 was probably the darkest year for Bustamante, especially considering his experience at the World Pool Championships. While the tournament was still going on, Bustamante was most shocked when he received a phone call from his wife informing him that his daughter, who was less than a year old, had died. Devastated by this, Bustamante strongly considered forfeiting his contention at the tournament to return to the Philippines, but some people around convinced him to go on.\n\nOn his way to the final, Bustamante bested Antonio Lining in the last 16, Efren Reyes in the quarter finals, and Ching Shun Yang in the semis. In the final, he met Earl Strickland, the 2-time winner of the tournament. Bustamante was leading most of the time and could have won the title. At one point, he went for a jump shot but missed. Strickland returned to the table and won three racks in a row to win the match 17-15.\n\nHis loss in the finals of the World Championship was most definitely a big blow to him because his lack of focus on the match cost him the tournament. Later on, however, Bustamante regained momentum and began winning more tournaments.\n\nBustamante won the Peninsula Nine-ball Open, Gabriel's Las Vegas International Nine-ball tournament, the IBC Tokyo Nine-ball International, and the All Japan Nine-ball Championship. He even won the Sudden Death Seven-ball tournament and dedicated the victory to his daughter, whom he had tragically lost. With such a string of victories, he became the \"AZBilliards\" 2002 Player of the Year.\nBustamante also won the tournament called the World Pool League in 2004 where he defeated the then world nine-ball champion Alex Pagulayan. He reached the finals of that event in 2001 but was bested by Steve Knight of Great Britain.\n\nIn 2007, he was undefeated in the United States Pro Tour Championship held at the Normandie Casino in Los Angeles, California.\n\nFor 2007, he was ranked #7 in \"Pool & Billiard Magazine\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Fans' Top 20 Favorite Players\" poll.\n\nHe competed in the 2008 World Straight Pool Championship as the Philippines' only entry. This was his first-ever participation in straight pool event. In the end, he finished at 2nd place behind Niels Feijen, the tournament winner.\n\nIn 2010, Bustamante again reached the finals of the World Nine-ball Championship. Unlike his first final eight years ago, fate did not deny him. Bustamante won the match and the title against Taiwan's Kuo Po-cheng, a second-placer in the 2005 event.\n\nOn July 27, 2010, Francisco Bustamante, along with Terry Bell and Larry Hubbart who are founders of the American Pool Players Association (APA), were elected to the Billiard Congress of America Hall of Fame. In this, Bustamante would become the second player from the Philippines after Efren Reyes to be added. The three were inducted on October 21, 2010.\n\nOn June 15, 2008, Efren Reyes, Francisco \"Django\" Bustamante, and 2007 Women's Amway World Pool Championships finalist, Rubilen \"Bingkay\" Amit, will begin photography and had been cast to star with American Jennifer Barretta in an independent film, \"9-Ball\", at Universal Studios. This movie will be directed and produced by Main Street Production's Anthony Palma, with Ralph Clemente as executive producer.[15]\n\n"}

It overlaps with the Jewelry District on its western end and Skid Row on its eastern end, and contains the Broadway Theater District and the Spring Street historic financial district.\nThe Historic Core is packed with a wealth of landmark buildings including the world's largest concentration of movie palaces as well as former large department stores, financial and other office towers, built chiefly between 1907 and 1931. See:\n\nThe Historic Core was the central business district (CBD) of the city from the first decade of the 1900s through the 1950s. Prior to 1900 the CBD was further north, where the Civic Center now stands. Starting in the 1950s what is now the Historic Core started to decline. Upscale shopping had moved west to the Seventh & Hope area starting in the 1920s, and to Mid-Wilshire by the 1930s. When consumers lived and worked near the prolific streetcar lines, it was relatively easy for them to reach downtown, the hub of both the Los Angeles Railway and Pacific Electric systems. Now, an ever increasing number of consumers had cars, lived further away from downtown, and due to the proliferation of suburban retail, were able to shop, dine, and go to the movies there without worries about downtown parking and traffic congestion. In addition, after World War II, financial institutions moved several blocks to the west, ending up on Figueroa Street, Flower Street, and Grand Avenue. In the 1950s the Historic Core became the center of Latino retail and entertainment in the city, e.g.: the Million Dollar Theatre featured the biggest names in the Spanish language entertainment world. This paralleled the general white flight occurring in Central Los Angeles at the time, which saw Broadway become a major center for Latino life in the city.\n\nAlthough prostitution and drug dealing had occurred in the area as far back as the early 1920s, they became epidemic in the 1960s. The area's movie palaces, built between 1911 and 1931, became grindhouses. The last of them closed in the 1990s; the Orpheum Theatre recently underwent a complete restoration at a cost of several million dollars, and is now used for major movie premieres (such as \"Collateral\" in 2005), celebrity events (Michael Jackson's birthday party), comedy shows (Bill Burr), fashion shows, concerts (Opeth), and plays. Most of the older buildings have stores that cater to the Latino immigrant working class.\n\nThe developing street gang problem in Los Angeles which began to worsen at the end of the 1960s and got considerably worse in the late 1970s, also hurt traditional commercial activity in the area, as it did much of downtown. While the LAPD indicates that the area is a sort of neutral zone, which has not been claimed by any single gang and random gang violence is rare, the area remains one of the major areas for street drug sales in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1999, the Los Angeles City Council passed an Adaptive Re-Use Ordinance, allowing for the conversion of old, unused office buildings to apartments or \"lofts.\" Developer Tom Gilmore purchased a series of century-old buildings and converted them into lofts near Main and Spring streets, a development now known as the \"Old Bank District.\" Other notable redevelopment projects in the Historic Core have included the Eastern Columbia Building, Broadway Trade Center, Higgins Building, The Security Building, the Pacific Electric Building, The Judson, and the Subway Terminal Building. As of 2005, redevelopment projects in downtown Los Angeles have been divided about evenly between rentals and condominiums; though projects near the Staples Center arena in the South Park neighborhood have been overwhelmingly dedicated to condominiums.\n\n\nHistoric Core Business Improvement District\n"}

It was founded early in 2005 with a view to contesting the municipal elections to the Lautoka City Council, scheduled for 22 October 2005. It failed to win any seats, however, either in the main election, or in the special election on 12 November for four seats in the Simla ward, which had been postponed.\n\nThe party contested the election on an anti-corruption platform. The Fiji Labour Party, which dominated the council, had recently suspended nine councillors - its entire council membership - in the wake of revelations that they had granted taxi bases to friends and colleagues. The SCRA called for the same standards of accountability that are required of parliamentarians to be applicable to municipal councillors.\n\nThe SCRA welcomed the Labour Party's decision to suspend its councillors, but claimed that the move did not go far enough. Alliance chairman Faaiaz Ali said that the same rules that required members of Parliament suspended from their parties to resign should be applied to local government office holders, as with no party to answer to, they could be an even greater threat to ratepayers. \"\"Now these councillors who have been suspended can do anything they want and they will definitely do everything they please because their term will expire in October,\"\" Ali said. He called for the Local Government Act to be amended to allow for their dismissal.\n\nOn 11 October, Ali announced that the Alliance would contest 9 of the 16 seats on the council. The party has nominated three candidates for each of the Waiyavi, Tavakubu and Veitari wards (multi-member constituencies), but has chosen not to contest the Simla Ward. Ali gave no reason for the decision to leave Simla uncontested, but said that the party was confident of winning most, if not all, of the 9 seats it was contending for. There is one woman among the six Indo-Fijians and three indigenous Fijians standing for the party. Ali himself is standing for the Veitari ward.\n\nThe same day, Ali warned city residents not to vote for candidates who hold permanent residency status in other countries. The Fijian constitution forbids dual citizenship, but permanent residency, which amounts to a kind of second-class in a number of other countries, is not covered by the ban. Ali said that holding Permanent Residency in another country made it too easy for councillors to abscond rather than face up to allegations of misconduct of council business, and that voters should be wary of such candidates.\n\nConsiderable publicity for the Alliance failed to break the hold of the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) on the City Council, however. The FLP ended up with 12 seats and the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) 4.\n\nSome time after the military coup of 2006, the SCRA was effectively dissolved.\n"}

It is loosely based on Anaïs Nin's French book of the same name, and tells the story of Nin's relationship with Henry Miller and his wife, June.\n\nThe film was nominated for Best Cinematography at the 63rd Academy Awards. It is one of three NC-17 films to receive Oscar nominations; the other films are \"Wild at Heart\" (1990) and \"Requiem for a Dream\" (2000). \n\nIn 1931 in Paris, France, Anaïs Nin is in a stable relationship with her husband Hugo, but longs for more out of life. When Nin first meets Henry Miller, he is working on his first novel. Nin is drawn to Miller and his wife June, as well as their bohemian lifestyle. Nin becomes involved in the couple's tormented relationship, having an affair with Miller and also pursuing June. Ultimately, Nin helps Miller to publish his novel, \"Tropic of Cancer\", but catalyzes the Millers' separation, while she returns to Hugo.\n\nThe soundtrack was arranged by Mark Adler, consisting of period popular songs.\n\n\"Henry & June\" was the first film to receive the MPAA's rating of NC-17 (\"Predator 2\" originally received this rating, but was cut to qualify for an R rating) which was devised as a replacement for the X rating. NC-17 was intended to signify serious, non-pornographic films with more violence or (especially) sexual content than would qualify for an R rating. The inclusion of the postcard Nin views at the start of the film (which is of Hokusai's \"The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife\"), and some scenes of \"le Bal des Beaux Arts\" contributed to the NC-17 rating.\n\nThe film was given a more lenient M rating in Australia and an uncut 18 in the United Kingdom. Conversely, it was banned in South Africa. The ban has since been lifted. The film was given an R18 rating in New Zealand.\n\n\"Henry & June\" grossed $11,567,449 in the domestic market and $11,905,000 internationally for a worldwide total of $23,472,449.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a B-, but felt that, \"Kaufman, trying to deepen the erotic explorations of Unbearable Lightness, ends up with a triangle movie that’s watchable but also arty and rather stilted. The biggest disappointment of the film is that, after all the ratings brouhaha, it’s not very sexy.\" Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" noted the film's efforts to present sex in a more artistic, highbrow manner, remarking, \"The film's sex scenes, photographed delicately by Philippe Rousselot and directed with great intensity by Mr. Kaufman, are particularly lofty. These sequences, often tinged with symbolism (a hand playing a guitar juxtaposed with a hand on a woman's breast), tend to be self-consciously bold,\" but felt the film lacked daring.\n\nThe film has a 62% approval rating on review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews, with an average rating of 6.09/10. The site's consensus reads, \"\"Henry & June\" celebrates sensuality and passion, though the portentous filmmaking drags it down by a large degree\".\n\n\n"}

Depending on various district definitions, either the Civic Center or Bunker Hill also contains the Music Center and adjacent Walt Disney Concert Hall; some maps, for example, place the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in the Civic Center but the Disney Concert Hall in Bunker Hill.\n\nThe Civic Center has the distinction of containing the largest concentration of government employees in the United States outside of Washington, D.C. The reason for the high concentration is simple: Los Angeles is the most populous county in the United States and its second largest city, and houses several state and federal functions for the region.\n\nLos Angeles' 1949 master plan called for branch administrative centers throughout the city, as it was rapidly expanding. In addition to the main civic center downtown, there is the West Los Angeles Civic Center in the Westside (built between 1957 and 1965) and the Van Nuys Civic Center in the San Fernando Valley, as well as a neighborhood city hall in San Pedro.\n\nThe Civic Center is served by numerous Metro buses, most of which run to adjacent Union Station, the 101 and 110 freeways, and the Metro Red Line and Purple Line's Civic Center/Grand Park Station are also in the vicinity. OCTA, Foothill Transit, DASH shuttles, Commuter Express and other municipal bus lines also serve the area. \n\nThe Regional Connector, currently under construction, will serve this area with two stations at Second/Flower and Second/Broadway station.\n\nPart of what is now the Civic Center occupies what was the central business district (CBD) in the 1880s and 1890s.\n\nThe Civic Center area is part of the ongoing Grand Avenue Project, which aims to develop existing parking lots in the area for residential and commercial use as well as create a Grand Park between the Los Angeles Music Center and City Hall.\n\nIn March 2017, the Los Angeles City Council approved a new Civic Center Master Plan. It details a full build out around city hall by the year 2032, specifically the east facing front. The CCMP schedules for a full tear down of Parker Center (torn down in 2019), L.A. City Hall's \"south\" building, and the Los Angeles Mall. The CCMP is to connect City Hall with its surrounding neighborhood and Little Tokyo. \n\nThe CCMP calls for active ground-floor uses, to stimulate the pedestrian traffic that the Civic Center currently lacks. Four new government and office towers are described in the plan as well as the planned Park 101 recreational area. A design approach idea to cover U.S. Highway 101 as a trench with green space above.

{"id": "2198145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198145", "title": "Every Man in His Humour", "text": "Every Man in His Humour\n\nEvery Man in His Humour is a 1598 play by the English playwright Ben Jonson. The play belongs to the subgenre of the \"humours comedy,\" in which each major character is dominated by an over-riding humour or obsession.\n\nAll the available evidence indicates that the play was performed by the Lord Chamberlain's Men in 1598 at the Curtain Theatre. That date is given in the play's reprint in Jonson's 1616 folio collection of his works; the text of the play (IV,iv,15) contains an allusion to John Barrose, a Burgundian fencer who challenged all comers that year and was hanged for murder on 10 July 1598. The play was also acted at Court on 2 February 1605.\n\nA theatre legend first recorded in 1709 by Nicholas Rowe has it that Shakespeare advocated production of the play at a point when the company was about to reject it. While this legend is unverifiable, it is almost certain, based on the playlist published in the folio, that Shakespeare played the part of Kno'well, the aged father. This is consistent with Shakespeare's habit of playing older characters, such as Adam in \"As You Like It\".\n\nThe play was entered into the Register of the Stationers' Company on 4 August 1600, along with the Shakespearean plays \"As You Like It,\" \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" and \"Henry V,\" in an entry marked \"to be stayed.\" It is thought that this entry was an attempt to block publication of the four plays; if so, the attempt failed, since the latter three plays appeared in print soon after. \"Every Man In\" was re-registered ten days later, on 14 August 1600, by the booksellers Cuthbert Burby and Walter Burre; the first quarto was published in 1601, with Burre's name on the title page. In the 1601 Quarto version, the play was set in Florence. The play was next printed in Jonson's 1616 folio, with the setting being moved to London\n\nThe play's contemporary popularity is attested by such quick publication; although there are few records of performance, it presumably stayed in the King's Men's repertory until the theatres closed in 1642.\n\nGerard Langbaine reports that the play was revived by the King's Company in 1675. The play remained vivid enough in memory for John Rich to revive it at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1725. However, it was not until David Garrick revived the play with substantial alterations in 1751 that the play regained currency on the English stage. Garrick's revisions served to focus attention on Kitely's jealousy; he both trimmed lines from the other plots and added a scene in which he attempts to elicit information from Cob while hiding his jealousy. The scene was a favourite, praised by Arthur Murphy and others; Kitely became one of Garrick's signature roles, and the play was never long out of his repertory.\n\nThe play declined in popularity in the last quarter of the century, in large part because it was seen as a Garrick vehicle. George Frederick Cooke revived the play at Covent Garden. Elizabeth Inchbald lauded the performance, calling Cooke's Kitely the equal of Garrick's. Cooke had mixed success with the play, though; it failed in Edinburgh in 1808. After 1803, Cooke may have alternated with Kemble in the title role for productions at Covent Garden.\n\nThereafter, the play has been subject to tentative revivals, none of which have established it as viable for modern repertory. Edmund Kean played Kitely in an unsuccessful 1816 production; his performance was praised by William Hazlitt. William Charles Macready essayed the role at the Haymarket Theatre in 1838; Robert Browning attended and approved the performance, but the play did not figure prominently in Macready's repertory.\n\nPerhaps the most unusual revival occurred in 1845, when Charles Dickens and his friends mounted a benefit production. Aided by Macready, Dickens took the faintly Dickensian role of Bobadill; George Cruikshank was Cob; John Forster played Kitely. The production went off well enough to be repeated three or four times over the next two years. Bulwer-Lytton wrote a poem as prologue for an 1847 production; in addition to Browning, Tennyson and John Payne Collier attended.\n\nBen Iden Payne produced the play in Manchester in 1909, and again in Stratford for the Jonson tercentenary in 1937. The later production received much more favourable reviews.\n\nJohn Caird directed the play during the inaugural season of the Swan Theatre in 1986.\n\nIn general outline, this play follows Latin models quite closely. In the main plot, a gentleman named Kno'well, concerned for his son's moral development, attempts to spy on his son, a typical city gallant; however, his espionage is continually subverted by the servant, Brainworm, whom he employs for this purpose. These types are clearly slightly Anglicized versions of ancient types of Greek New Comedy, namely the senex, the son, and the slave. In the subplot, a merchant named Kitely suffers intense jealousy, fearing that his wife is cuckolding him with some of the wastrels brought to his home by his brother-in-law, Wellbred. The characters of these two plots are surrounded by various \"humorous\" characters, all in familiar English types: the irascible soldier, country gull, pretentious pot-poets, surly water-bearer, and avuncular judge all make an appearance. The play works through a series of complications which culminate when the justice, Clement, hears and decides all of the characters' various grievances, exposing each of them as based in humour, misperception, or deceit.\n\nJonson's purpose is delineated in the prologue he wrote for the folio version. These lines, which have justly been taken as applying to Jonson's comic theory in general, are especially appropriate to this play. He promises to present \"deeds, and language, such as men do use:/ And persons, such as comedy would choose,/ When she would show an Image of the times,/ And sport with human follies, not with crimes.\" The play follows out this implicit rejection of the romantic comedy of his peers. It sticks quite carefully to the Aristotelian unities; the plot is a tightly woven mesh of act and reaction; the scenes a genial collection of depictions of everyday life in a large Renaissance city.\n\nCritics of the nineteenth century tended to credit Jonson with the introduction of \"humour\" comedy into English literature. It is now well known, not only that George Chapman's \"An Humorous Day's Mirth\" preceded Jonson's play by a year or more, but that Jonson himself was not especially intrigued by the trope of \"humours.\" Since only Kitely is dominated by a \"humour\" as Jonson defined it in \"Every Man Out of His Humour\", it seems more likely that Jonson was using a contemporary taste aroused by Chapman to draw interest to his play, which became his first indisputable hit.\n\nJonson revised the play for the 1616 folio, where it was the first play presented. The most significant change was in the location. The 1598 edition was set in a vaguely identified Florence. Even in the original version, the background details were English; the revision formalises this fact by giving the characters English names and replacing the vaguely English details with specific references to London places.\n\nThe folio also gives a cast list for the original 1598 production. After Shakespeare, the main players are given in the following order: Richard Burbage, Augustine Phillips, John Heminges, Henry Condell, Thomas Pope, William Sly, Christopher Beeston, William Kempe, and John Duke. (Kempe would leave the company the next year, for his famous morris dance from London to Norwich.)\n\nIn 1599, Jonson wrote what would prove to be a much less popular sequel, \"Every Man out of His Humour\".\n\nThe play was revived around 1670; Sackville provided a verse epilogue in which Jonson himself appeared as a ghost. David Garrick brought a revised version to the stage in 1751; the changes he made served chiefly to focus attention on the part of Kitely, which he played. The largest change was an entirely new scene featuring only Kitely and his wife, in which Kitely attempts to hide his jealousy. The production featured a prologue by William Whitehead and proved popular enough for many revivals. However, as critics near the end of the eighteenth century noted, the play's popularity arose more from Garrick than from Jonson; the play fell from regular use, with the rest of Jonson's comedies, by the beginning of the nineteenth century.\n\n\n"}

It is a conceptual sequel to his 1598 comedy \"Every Man in His Humour\". It was much less successful on stage than its predecessor, though it was published in quarto three times in 1600 alone; it was also performed at Court on 8 January 1605.\n\nThe play was entered into the Register of the Stationers' Company on 8 April 1600 by the bookseller William Holme, who published the first quarto of the play soon after. Holmes issued a second quarto later that year, with the printing done by Peter Short. Yet a third quarto appeared in 1600, published by Nicholas Ling, the stationer who would issue the \"bad quarto\" of \"Hamlet\" three years later. W. W. Greg characterized Ling's Q3 as \"A careless and ignorant reprint\" of Q1.\n\n\"Every Man Out\" contains an allusion to John Marston's \"Histriomastix\" in Act III, scene i, a play that was acted in the autumn of 1599; the clown character Clove speaks \"fustian\" in mimicry of Marston's style. This is one instance of Jonson's involvement in the War of the Theatres. Scholars have found references to Sir Walter Raleigh and Gabriel Harvey. The characters Fastidious Brisk and Carlo Buffone in \"Every Man Out\"—like Hedon and Anaides in \"Cynthia's Revels\" and Crispinus and Demeter in \"The Poetaster\"—are representations of Marston and Thomas Dekker. The character Sogliardo, who Jonson includes in his general mockery of socially ambitious fools, is a country bumpkin, new to the city, who boasts of the coat of arms he has recently purchased, which, when he describes its colors, resembles a fool’s motley. Another character suggests Sogliardo should use the motto, \"Not Without Mustard\". This has been construed by some critics as a reference to William Shakespeare’s recently acquired coat of arms with its gold color, and its motto, \"Non Sans Droit\", which translates as \"Not Without Right\". \n\nWhen the play was reprinted in Jonson's folio collection of 1616, a cast list of the original 1599 production was included. From this, it is known that the leading players were Richard Burbage, John Heminges, Henry Condell, Augustine Phillips, Thomas Pope, and William Sly. Shakespeare was not part of the production, though he had played in \"Every Man in His Humour\" the year before.\n\n\"Every Man Out of His Humour\" includes several references to Shakespeare and his contemporaneous works: a mention of Justice Silence from \"Henry IV, Part 2\"—\"this is a kinsman to Justice Silence\" (V,ii) and two allusions to \"Julius Caesar\", which help to date that play to 1599. \"Et tu, Brute\" occurs in V,iv of \"Every Man Out;\" in III,i appears \"reason long since is fled to animals,\" a paraphrase of Shakespeare's line \"O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts\" in \"Julius Caesar,\" III,ii,104.\n\nPaul's walk\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2198173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198173", "title": "Afzal Khan (general)", "text": "Afzal Khan (general)\n\nAfzal Khan (died 20 November 1659) was a general who served the Adil Shahi dynasty of Bijapur Sultanate in India. He played an important role in the southern expansion of the Bijapur Sultanate by subjugating the Nayaka chiefs who had taken control of the former Vijayanagara territory.\n\nIn 1659, the Bijapur government sent Afzal Khan to subjugate Shivaji, a former vassal who had started acting independently. He was killed at a truce negotiation meeting with Shivaji, and his army was defeated at the Battle of Pratapgad.\n\nAmid the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire, the Bijapur government campaigned against the Nayaka chiefs who had taken control of the former Vijayanagara territory. One of these chiefs was Virabhadra, the Nayaka of Ikkeri. Kenge Nayaka (or Keng Nayak), the chief of Basavapattana and a discontented tributary of Virabhadra, helped the Bijapur army capture Ikkeri in exchange for 100,000 rupees, forcing Virabhadra to flee to Bednur. Subsequently, the Bijapur government decided to capture the forts of Adoni and Tadipatri, which were ruled by friends of Kenge Nayaka. Kenge Nayaka suggested that the march to these areas was difficult, and instead advised Bijapur to capture Bangalore. In exchange for this advice, Kenge Nayaka demanded the fort of Sira, which was located on the way to Bangalore.\n\nThe Bijapur commander Randaula Khan sent a force led by Afzal Khan to capture Sira. Kasturi Ranga Nayaka, the commander of Sira, came out of the fort to negotiate with Afzal Khan, but Afzal Khan treacherously killed him. The defenders closed the fort gates before Afzal Khan could enter the fort, but Afzal Khan's contingent was soon reinforced by the main Bijapur army led by Randaula Khan. The Bijapur army captured the fort, and handed it over to Kenge Nayaka, while sending the captured wealth to Bijapur. Kenge Nayaka subsequently switched his allegiance to Bangalore, but then re-joined Bijapur, and convinced the Bangalore ruler Kempe Gowda to surrender his fort to Bijapur.\n\nRandaula Khan then invaded Mysore, whose ruler Kanthirava Narasaraja I negotiated peace by paying 500,000 rupees to Bijapur. Subsequently, Kenge Nayaka rebelled against Bijapur, and asserted independence at Basavapattana, where he raised an army of 70,000 soldiers to guard the fort. Randaula Khan then formed an alliance with his former overlord Virabhadra, the former Nayaka of Ikkeri, and besieged Basavapattana. Afzal Khan, along with Shahaji and other commanders of African origin, was deployed at the main gate of the Basavapattana fort. He entered the fort after a fierce battle, killed the guards, and captured the \"qasba\" - the central part of the fortified town. Kenge Nayaka then launched three successive attacks against him, but Afzal Khan forced him to retreat. Encouraged by Afzal Khan's successes, the Bijapur forces attacked Kenge Nayaka's contingent from both sides. After losing 3,700 soldiers, Kenge Nayaka surrendered the fort, and agreed to pay Bijapur 4 million \"huns\". He was imprisoned, and later killed for attempting to bribe a guard for his release.\n\nBijapur's victory over Kenge Nayaka frightened the other Nayakas of present-day Karnataka into accepting Bijapur's suzerainty. Randaula Khan sent Afzal Khan to capture Chikkanayakana Halli, whose chief (\"raja\") offered to accept Bijapur's suzerainty. The chief was allowed to keep control of the town (\"qasba\") in exchange for 20,000 \"huns\", but Afzal Khan took control of the fort. Afzal Khan then besieged the fort of Belur, joined by the main Bijapur army. After a four-month long siege, the local chief Venkatapati started peace negotiations, offering to cede the fort of Sakrepatna near Belur. Ultimately, he became a vassal of Bijapur, as did the Nayaka of Tumkur.\n\nAfzal Khan is best remembered for his campaign against Shivaji, the founder of the kingdom that later evolved into the Maratha Empire. This campaign, which resulted in Afzal Khan's death, came to be highly celebrated in the Marathi literature. The earliest sources that describe the episode include:\n\n\nShivaji was a son of the Bijapur's general Shahaji, who had fought alongside Afzal Khan. He administered Shahaji's fiefs in the Pune region, and had started acting independently of the Bijapur government. He had captured territories ruled by other subordinates of Bijapur, and had negotiated with the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, who had invaded the Bijapur Sultanate. Shivaji claimed to be a loyal servant of Bijapur, but the Bijapur government doubted his loyalty. During much of the 1650s, the Bijapur government had been unable to take any steps against Shivaji because it was busy dealing with the Mughal invasion, internal factional politics, and a succession dispute. After a peace treaty with the Mughals, and the general acceptance of Ali Adil Shah II as the king, the Bijapur government became more stable, and turned its attention towards Shivaji.\n\nAli Adil Shah II was a minor whose mother had been the de-facto ruler since the mid-1640s, when his father had fallen seriously ill. The decision of sending Afzal Khan against Shivaji was probably taken by his mother. An English letter sent by factor Henry Revington to East India Company, dated 10 December 1659, states that the queen advised Afzal Khan to pretend friendship with Shivaji, because military strength would not be enough to defeat Shivaji.\n\nShivaji reportedly commanded a 60,000 infantry after his conquest of Javli. On the other hand, Afzal Khan's army - including infantry and cavalry - had 10,000 soldiers. This number is supported by the English letter, as well as \"Tarikh-i-Ali\". Maratha sources exaggerate the strength of Afzal Khan's forces in order to glorify Shivaji's victory, claiming that it had as many as 35,000 infantry; 12,000 cavalry; and 500 cannons. For example, the \"Chitnis Bakhar\" claims that Afzal Khan's army numbered 30,000 men; and Sabhasad claims that it had 12,000 cavalry plus additional infantry. \"Shivaji-Pratpa\", \"Rairi Bakhar\", \"91 Qalami Bakhar\", and \"Tarikh-i-Shivaji\" state that Afzal Khan's army numbered 12,000.\n\nAfzal Khan, like the ruler of Bijapur, was a Muslim, while Shivaji was a Hindu. According to \"Shiva-Bharata\" (1674), composed under Shivaji's patronage, Afzal Khan's army started its march amid several evil omens, such as falling meteors and thunderbolts in cloudless sky. The text states that Afzal Khan first came to Tuljapur, where he destroyed the idol of Shivaji's family goddess Bhavani, and slaughtered a cow (considered holy by the Hindus) in front of her temple. \"Afzal Khan Vadh\" states that Afzal Khan challenged the goddess to show her some miracle. He went on the desecrate the Hindu temples at Pandharpur and Shingnapur (Shambhu Mahadev).\n\nSabhasad also supports the account of Afzal Khan's desecrations at Tuljapur and Pandharpur. The \"Chitnis Bakhar\" and \"Shiva Digvijaya\" state that the idols at Tuljapur and Pandharpur were removed before Afzal Khan could destroy them. The contemporary English letters of the East India Company, the Dutch East India Company's Dagh-register, and the Portuguese records do not mention any desecration of temples by Afzal Khan.\n\nAfzal Khan finally encamped at Wai, a town that he had governed in the earlier years. Shivaji had taken up residence in the newly-fortified Pratapgad, and Afzal Khan's desecration of Hindu sites was probably aimed at provoking Shivaji into leaving the safety of the fort. These actions alienated the local Hindu \"deshmukhs\", who could have provided local support to Afzal Khan. Since Afzal Khan had governed the Wai region in the past, and knew it well, he presumed that he did not need such local support.\n\nAt Wai, Afzal Khan wrote to local chiefs, seeking their support against Shivaji. Vithoji Haibat Rao, the \"deshmukh\" of Gunjan-Maval, was asked to bring a contingent to Javli in Afzal Khan's support. Khandoji Khopde agreed to support Afzal Khan on the condition that he would be made the \"deshmukh\" of Rohidkhore, which was held by Shivaji's loyalist Kanhoji Jedhe.\n\nAccording to Sabhasad, Afzal Khan then sent his envoy Krishnaji Bhaskar to Shivaji, declaring that he was a great friend of Shivaji's father Shahaji. He promised that he would use his influence in the Bijapur court to get the king to officially recognize Shivaji's control over Konkan and various forts. He also promised to secure further distinction and military equipment for Shivaji from Bijapur. Finally, he declared that Shivaji was welcome to attend the Bijapur court, or be granted an exemption from personal attendance, if he so desired.\n\nMeanwhile, Afzal Khan's unchallenged march to Wai had greatly frightened Shivaji's followers. His well-equipped army had freely plundered the territory of Shivaji, who had confined himself to a fort instead of challenging Afzal Khan in an open battlefield. Both Sabhasad and \"Chitnis Bakhar\" state that Shivaji's counsellors urged him to avoid losses by negotiating peace with Afzal Khan.\n\nTexts such as \"Afzal Khan Vadh\" and \"Shiva-Bharata\" claim that the goddess Bhavani appeared in Shivaji's dream, warning him of Afzal Khan's treacherous plans, and assuring him of victory. After waking up, Shivaji prayed to the goddess, and resolved to either win against Afzal Khan or die fighting. He summoned the armies of his generals - Moro Trimbak Pingle from Konkan and Netaji Palkar from the Ghats - close to Pratapgad.\n\nShivaji treated Afzal Khan's envoy Krishnaji Bhaskar with respect, and met him secretly at night, urging him as a Hindu to divulge Afzal Khan's real intentions. Krishnaji hinted that Afzal Khan had treacherous plans. Shivaji then sent Krishnaji back to Afzal Khan with his own agent Gopinath Pant. The envoy presented Shivaji as someone who respected Afzal Khan as an elder and an associate of his father, and as someone who was willing to submit easily. However, his real objective was to find the enemy's military strength and intentions. Sabhasad states that Gopinath bribed Afzal Khan's officers, and learned that Afzal Khan planned to arrest Shivaji at the meeting.\n\nAfter learning these details from Gopinath, Shivaji pretended that he was scared of Afzal Khan, and refused to come to Wai for a meeting. Shivaji's envoy proposed a negotiation meeting with only a few bodyguards at Javli, located near the foot of the Pratpagad fort. Afzal Khan agreed, and accordingly, Shivaji ordered his men to clear forest and create a path from Wai to Pratapgad.\n\nThe place chosen for the meeting was a crest located below Pratapgad, overlooking the Koyna River valley. One day before the meeting, Afzal Khan marched to Par, a village near Pratapgad, via the Radtondi pass. His soldiers encamped in scattered places, close to water bodies near the source of the Koyna River. Meanwhile, Shivaji placed his soldiers in ambush at various intervals along the path leading to the meeting point. He set up luxurious tents at the meeting place.\n\nBefore departing for the meeting, Shivaji left instructions for continuation of his government, in case he was killed at the meeting.\n\nShivaji took precautionary measures to defend himself against Afzal Khan: he put on thin chain mail and an iron cap under his clothes, and concealed two weapons: the bagh nakh (\"tiger claws\" or metal hooks attached to fingers), and a sword said to be \"possessed\" by the goddess. He left for the meeting accompanied by two soldiers - his expert swordsman Jiva Mahala and Shambhuji Kavji, each of whom carried two swords and a shield.\n\nAfzal Khan left his camp at Par with an escort of 1,000 soldiers. However, Shivaji's envoy Gopinath argued that such a large escort would scare Shivaji away from the meeting, and convinced Afzal Khan to bring only two soldiers to the meeting, just like Shivaji. Accordingly, Afzal Khan left most of his escort at a short distance from the meeting place, and came to meet Shivaji in a \"palki\" (litter (vehicle)), accompanied by five men: two soldiers, his expert swordsman Sayyid Banda, and the Brahmin envoys Krishnaji and Gopinath.\n\nShivaji, who was waiting at a distance from the meeting place, demanded that Sayyid Banda leave the tent where the meeting was scheduled. Afzal Khan agreed to the demand: both Afzal Khan and Shivaji now entered inside the tent, each accompanied by three men - two soldiers and an envoy. Afzal Khan insulted Shivaji by calling him a peasant (\"kunbi\") boy, and Shivaji responded by calling him a son of a fry cook (\"bhatari\").\n\nAccording to the Maratha texts, Afzal Khan asked Shivaji to submit to the Bijapuri king Adil Shah, and be recognized as a vassal lord. He pretended to embrace Shivaji, but then quickly stabbed him with a concealed weapon. Shivaji was protected by his chain mail, and retaliated. Afzal Khan then rushed out of the tent; his companion Sayyid Banda attacked Shivaji, but was killed by Jiva Mahala. This event is remembered in a Marathi language idiom \"Hōtā Jivā Mhaṇun Vāchlā Shivā\" (\"Because of Jiva; Shivaji survived the attack\").\n\nAfzal Khan was subsequently killed and beheaded. The various sources differ regarding who killed Afzal Khan, and how:\n\n\"Muntakhab-al Lubab\", a work by the Mughal chronicler Khafi Khan, attributes the treachery to Shivaji instead: it states that Shivaji feigned humility and tears while apporaching Afzal Khan, confessing his sins and asking for forgiveness after every 3-4 steps. He then pretended to tremble with fear, and requested that Afzal Khan's companions withdraw to a distance. In reality, he had stationed his soldiers in ambush in every cave, and concealed a bichuwa (dagger), which he used to treacherously attack Afzal Khan.\n\nAfter Afzal Khan's killing, Shivaji's Maratha troops, hidden in the forest, came out and routed the Bijapur army at the Battle of Pratapgad, on 20 November 1659 (10 November 1659 in Julian calendar). According to Revington's letter, around 3,000 of Afzal Khan's soldiers died in the battle. Two of Afzal Khan's sons were captured by Shivaji's soldiers. Another son - Fazl Khan - escaped along with Afzal Khan's wives with the support of Khandoji Khopde. The Maratha texts state that many of Afzal Khan's men were killed, but those who surrendered were invited to join Shivaji.\n\nAfzal Khan's head was presented before the goddess Bhavani and Shivaji's mother Jijabai as a trophy, and later buried under the \"Abdullah Tower\" at Pratapgad. The rest of Afzal Khan's body was buried in Javli.\n\nShivaji's victory over Afzal Khan caught the popular imagination of the local public, and ballads glorifying the event were sung by wandering bards (gondhalis). The victory is also glorified in the local literature (see Powada). The \"Afzal Khan Vadh\" equates Shivaji to Rama, and Afzal Khan to Ravana. The \"Shiva-Bharata\" similarly describes Shivaji as an avatar of Vishnu, while portraying Afzal Khan as a demonic incarnation. The \"Shri-Shiva-Prabhuche\" compares the conflict to the legendary Kurukshetra War, equating Shivaji to Bhima and Afzal Khan to Duryodhana.\n\nSeveral legends about Afzal Khan's fatal campaign became popular in the following years. One of these legends claims that he had a premonition about his death before he started his march against Shivaji. Therefore, he buried his 63 wives at Afzalpura near Bijapur to ensure that no other men would get them after his death.\n\nAn annual \"urs\" (death anniversary celebration) was held at Afzal Khan's tomb, but in the 1990s, right-wing Hindus objected to the alleged Muslim glorification of Afzal Khan as a martyr during the event. They formed an organization called Pratapgarh Utsav Samiti, and started organizing \"Shiv Pratap Din\" (\"Shivaji Glorification Day\") to celebrate Shivaji's victory over Afzal Khan. The Samiti observed the day at the Pratapgad fort from 1996 to 2004, when the Congress-NCP-led state government banned the politicized celebration because of provocative speeches and riots at the event. In 2014, the state passed a resolution banning exhibition of paintings of Shivaji killing Afzal Khan, after some Muslim groups objected to such a painting.\n\n"}

The direct sequel to \"The House of the Dead\", it was developed by Sega for arcades on the Sega NAOMI board in November 1998 then later ported to the Dreamcast in 1999 and Microsoft Windows in 2001, and is also found on the Xbox as an unlockable bonus in \"The House of the Dead III\". The game appears in the compilation \"The House of the Dead 2 & 3 Return\" for Wii. The Dreamcast version became a \"Sega All Stars\" title.\n\n\"The House of the Dead 2\" is a rail shooter light gun game. It includes an auto-reload feature that allows players to point their guns off-screen to reload their weapons without pulling the trigger. It also incorporates a branching path system that allows players to take a variety of different routes leading to the same point in the game's story.\n\nThe game served as the springboard for the arcade, Sega Dreamcast, and PC release \"The Typing of the Dead\", the Nintendo DS release \"English of the Dead\", as well as the inspiration for the Game Boy Advance game, \"The Pinball of the Dead\".\n\nThe flashbacks to the first \"The House of the Dead\" in the game's introductory sequence were recorded using the game's engine.\n\nThe game follows the fictional events of February 26, 2000, fourteen months after the 1998 Curien Mansion incident in \"The House of the Dead\". \n\nAMS agent G has gone missing and his last known location is Venice, Italy. The city of Venice becomes chaotic when a strange zombie breakout takes place. American AMS agents James Taylor and Gary Stewart are dispatched, along with Amy Crystal and Harry Harris, to investigate and evacuate the populace. They suddenly encounter the impish Zeal, who had recently dealt with G. Upon finding G alive but wounded, James and Gary converse with him and G gives them a field journal showing the bosses and weak points. The pair are then met with a massive undead horde, similar to the kind from the Curien Mansion incident. They continue on, trying to save the town's civilians from the zombies.\n\nDuring the chaos, James and Gary face Judgment; consisting of Zeal and his giant, headless, axe-wielding armored puppet Kuarl. After killing it, they meet up with Amy and Harry, who split up and try to meet at Sunset Bridge (or the wharf, depending on the player's actions). Upon getting there the group faces off with The Hierophant, an aquatic fishlike humanoid which heads an assault on Venice's waterways and Central Plaza. Upon defeating it, James, Gary, Amy and Harry get on a boat and continue through the rivers.\n\nIt is revealed that the zombies were created by Caleb Goldman, the man who funded Doctor Curien in making his creations during the Curien Mansion incident. It is also revealed that Goldman created the new zombies and released them into the city. Goldman leaves a message on Amy's phone, inviting them to meet him at the Colosseum. Although fearing it's a trap, the group continues on. James and Gary split up again, and face off with a group of serpents known as The Tower. After killing the mother serpent, they receive a phone call for help from Amy, before getting cut off. The two quickly race to the Colosseum only to discover Amy and a wounded Harry, injured by Strength, a giant, chainsaw-wielding zombie which wounds Harry and chases James and Gary throughout the Roman Colosseum. After they kill it, James and Gary push on, while Amy tends to Harry's wounds. They drive over to Goldman's tower, fighting Judgment, the Hierophant, and the Tower (who were revived by Goldman). They are confronted by Curien's masterpiece, The Magician, who was also revived by Goldman to oversee the birth of The Emperor, a shapeshifting crystalline entity with magnetism manipulation abilities designed to protect nature from humanity. After they defeat the Magician, they head to the top of the tower to confront the Emperor. In its prototype stage, the Emperor is not as strong as Goldman had hoped, and falls to the AMS agents. In order to evade being arrested, Goldman commits suicide by throwing himself off the roof of his building.\n\nPlayers are given different endings based on the following conditions:\n\nIn the good ending, James and Gary run into Thomas Rogan, the main character from the first game, who tells them that G and Harry are all right, and that they should head off to their next battle \"as long as they have the will to live\" (in the case of James) or \"as long as there is an answer\" (in the case of Gary). In the normal ending, as James and Gary leave the building, they are greeted by G, Amy and Harry, as well as a large group of civilians, who thank them for their help. In the bad ending, James and Gary run into a zombified Goldman outside the building. As the screen goes white, a gunshot is heard.\n\n\"The House of the Dead 2\" was later ported to the Dreamcast, as a launch title for the system, Xbox, as an unlockable on the Xbox port of \"The House of the Dead 3\", PC, and Wii, in a double release with \"The House of the Dead 3\".

{"id": "2198176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198176", "title": "Deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union", "text": "Deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union\n\nDeportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union, originally conceived in 1926, initiated in 1930, and carried through in 1937, was the first mass transfer of an entire nationality in the Soviet Union. Almost the entire Soviet population of ethnic Koreans (171,781 persons) were forcefully moved from the Russian Far East to unpopulated areas of the Kazakh SSR and the Uzbek SSR in October 1937. The official reason for the deportation was to stem \"the penetration of the Japanese espionage into the Far Eastern Krai\", as Koreans were at the time subjects of the Empire of Japan, which was hostile to the Soviet Union. Estimates based on population statistics suggest that 40,000 deported Koreans died in 1937 and 1938 from starvation, exposure and difficulties adapting to their new environment.\n\nKorean immigrants first appeared in the Russian Far East in the 1850s and early 1860s. By the 1890s, they had received the right to register as citizens of the Russian Empire, under the terms of a Russo-Korean treaty that determined their citizenship status at that time. Korean migrants who had moved to Russia referred to themselves as the Koryo Saram. As more Korean immigrants arrived in the Russian Far East, the Korean minority became one of the largest border minorities in the Soviet Union, facing in the 1920s and the 1930s the Japanese-occupied Korea on the other side. This minority had been gradually building up since the second half of the 19th century, as poor Korean peasants migrated across the border in search for land and livelihoods. The Korean immigration increased dramatically during the early 1920s, after the Russo-Japanese war of 1904–1905 and Japan's subsequent establishment of a protectorate over Korea.\n\nBy the October Revolution in 1917, there were about 100,000 Koreans in Russia.\nDuring the Russian Civil War, Korean allegiance lay primarily with the Bolsheviks, due at least in part to the fact that, “Japanese oppression in Korea and occupied Siberia made most Koreans, if not Bolsheviks, then enemies of the Bolsheviks’ enemies.” Korean immigrants began to submit applications for citizenship in the emerging RSFSR. Suspicions of the “political unreliability” of Koreans, however, meant that in practice relatively few would ever receive citizenship; in 1923, 1300 out of 6000 applicants were accepted for citizenship, and in the following year, 1247 out of 4761.\n\nIn 1917–1926, the Soviet Korean population tripled to nearly 170,000 people, and by 1926, Koreans represented more than a quarter of the rural population of the Vladivostok region. Under the circumstances, the official Soviet policy of national minorities prescribed formation of a Korean autonomous territory (the proposed Korean ASSR) for the large Korean community in the Russian Far East.\nAfter the Soviet government approved the formation of a Jewish Autonomous District in Birobidzhan, members of the Koryo Saram petitioned for the establishment of a Far Eastern Korean National District. This was denied in 1929, due to opposition from the local Russian population fearing competition for land, as well as the political goal of maintaining a peaceful stance toward Imperial Japan.\n\nAs a result, a contradictory policy emerged. On the one hand, the State authorized smaller Korean national territories, and established Korean-language schools and newspapers, representing Koreans as a model Soviet national minority. This was presented with stark contrast to the Korean population suffering under the yoke of Japanese occupation across the border.\nOn the other hand, however, the central government confirmed a secret plan (adopted on December 6, 1926) to resettle half of the Soviet Koreans (88,000 people) north of Khabarovsk on suspicions of disloyalty to the Soviet Union.\n\nThis resettlement plan was not implemented before 1930 for a variety of political and budgetary reasons, however. The first forced transfer of Korean immigrants to the north, excepting those who were explicitly proven loyal, began in 1930, initially in small amounts (by 1931, when the plan was officially abandoned, only 500 Korean families (2,500 individuals) had been resettled in the north.). Though this was the first case of ethnic cleansing by the Soviet Union, large-scale resettlement was delayed until 1937 out of the fear that Japan might consider it \"casus belli\".\n\nThe resettlement plans were revived with new vigor in August 1937, ostensibly with the purpose of suppressing \"the penetration of the Japanese espionage into the Far Eastern Krai\". From September to October 1937, the Soviet authorities deported tens of thousands of persons of Korean origin from the Russian Far East to Soviet Central Asia.\n\nMore than 172,000 Koreans were deported from the border regions of the Russian Far East as part of Joseph Stalin's policy of systematic population transfer. Its legal basis was the joint decree #1428-326сс of the USSR Sovnarkom and VKP(b) Central Committee of August 21, 1937, \"About Deportation of the Korean Population from the Border Regions of the Far Eastern Krai\" (\"\"), signed by Stalin and Molotov. An additional resolution, No. 1647-377cc, on the total deportation of Koreans from all territories (without any exception) of the FEK including non-bordering, remote regions and neighboring oblasts, was passed on September 28 of that year. The initial decree #1428-326cc of the USSR Council of People's Commissars and the CC of the VCP (b) August 21, 1937 stated:\n\nThe Council of People’s Commissars and CC of the VCP (b) hereby order: To prevent the penetration of Japanese espionage to the Far East region undertake the following acts:\n\nThe justification for resolution 1428-326cc was that it had been planned with the aim to “prevent the infiltration of Japanese spies to the Far East.\" However, no conclusive documents or other information on the matter have ever been found.\nCentral Asian historian German Kim provides further consideration on the causes of the deportation of Koreans to Central Asia from the Far East: namely, that\n\nFor the implementation of the decision, Genrikh Lyushkov was transferred from Rostov and assigned chief of the Far Eastern Krai NKVD. Soviet Koreans were resettled to Kazakh SSR and Uzbek SSR (in the latter case including Karakalpak ASSR).\n\nThe deportation was preceded by a typical Soviet scenario of political repression: falsified trials of local party leaders accused of insurrection, accusations of plans of the secession of the Far Eastern Krai, local party purges, and articles in \"Pravda\" about the Japanese espionage in the Far East.\n\nThe deportation was executed by NKVD Troikas of several levels — oblast troikas, raion troikas, and \"group\" troikas () — under strict monitoring of deadlines. Hundreds of party functionaries were purged and repressed for failures in this operation.\n\nThe deportation was performed in three batches, graded by the remoteness to the border; the first was the Posyet raion and \"raions adjacent to Grodekovo\". The deportees were transported by railway trains of about 50 carriages each, with 25–30 people per carriage. Travel to the destination took between 30 and 40 days.\n\nNikolai Yezhov reported the completion of the deportation of Koreans from Far Eastern Krai on October 25, 1937. In total, 36,442 families counting 171,781 persons were reported to be resettled. The Koreans remaining in Kamchatka, fishermen in the sea, and those on business trips were to be deported in an additional train by November 1. Mikhail N. Pak has suggested that the resolution may have been part of a larger concessionary agreement between the Soviet Union and Japan, due to Japanese perception that the Soviet-Korean community in the Russian Far East presented a threat.\n\nApproximately 100,000 Koreans were deported to the Kazakh SSR and 74,000 were sent to the Uzbek SSR. Those willing to leave were paid a bounty of 370 rubles and their train fare; the rest were bundled into trains by the NKVD. 700 Koreans were identified in the Soviet labor camps and were sent to join their compatriots in Kazakhstan. Deportees were also allowed to take livestock with them and received some compensation (on average 6,000 rubles per family) for property left behind. Many Koreans were placed far from each other in isolation to prevent contact with each other. 34,000 Koreans were placed on the desolate outpost of Ushtobe, Kazakhstan with no food and no shelter and were forced to survive on their own for almost three years. Monetary assistance promised by the government never materialised, and furthermore, most of the deported were rice farmers and fishers, who had difficulty adapting to the arid climate of their new home. Thousands died of starvation, sickness and exposure during the first few years in Central Asia. Estimates based on population statistics suggest that 40,000 deported Koreans died in 1937 and 1938 for these reasons. The ethnic Kazakhs were essential during these first few years for the Koreans. They provided shelter and food to help the Koreans suffering from starvation and cold.\n\nIt was in Kazakhstan that the Korean theater, the Korean newspaper \"Senbong\", a Korean pedagogical institute and college, and deposits of Korean language books were relocated, making Kazakhstan the center of Korean intellectual life in the Soviet Union. The Koreans contributed to the development of agriculture in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. More than one hundred Koreans were designated Heroes of Socialist Labor, one of the highest honors of the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, many Koreans volunteered to go to the front, but only a few were allowed. One of them, Captain Aleksandr Pavlovich Min, was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, the country's highest honor.<ref name=\"http://world.lib.ru\">German Kim, [Koreans in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Russia Koreans in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Russia], Lib.ru, 2004</ref>\n\nKoreans had little rights and freedom during their first few years in Central Asia, and although they starred in propaganda films to demonstrate the success of collective farming they were not trusted by the USSR. They were not permitted to travel outside their respective farming towns and villages and could still not practice their native tongue. Some Soviet Koreans were sent to North Korea to act as agricultural advisers, but they forced back as Kim Il-Sung did not trust them. It was not until Stalin's death in 1953 that many Koreans began to push for more rights and opportunities within the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1956, Nikita Khrushchev decided to give the Soviet Koreans freedom and for the first time they were given the right to decide where to live and what to do. Many Koreans moved to the cities to start professions in medicine and education. Others, however, stayed and worked on their highly productive farms. When Khrushchev introduced his Virgin Lands Campaign, Korean farms were consolidated into larger collective farms as part of the prefect.\n\nDue to their organizational skill and work ethic, many Koreans were soon leaders of industry, government, and educational institutions within the Soviet Union. Koreans were elected to the Parliaments of the Soviet Union and Central Asian Republics and by the 1970s the number of Koreans with a college degree was twice that of the general population. Today hundreds of Koreans in Central Asia and Russia have received Ph.D's and work as professors and researchers in universities, institutes and scientific centers. In addition, Koreans are the most urbanized ethnic group in both Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, as more than 80% of the Korean population live in cities. According to the 1989 census, the number of Koreans living in the Soviet Union was 439,000, the bulk of which lived in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Russia, with more than 80% of that in Kazakhstan, and based on an analysis of Kazakh ‘areas of compact living’, the majority of Kazakh-Koreans today live in urban areas in the central and southern regions of Kazakhstan, most notably Kyzylorda, Karaghandy, Dzhambul, and Almaty, and most live in urban areas.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian Federation adopted a decree on the restoration of ethnic Korean rights. Under the new decree, the State permitted ‘individual and voluntary return to the former place of residence’ for deportees, and Russian citizenship could be obtained by any migrants from outside Russia. The decree also provided Korean returnees with ‘residential houses and lands for farming and other activities,’ if they desired.\n\nAs time has passed the Koryo Saram raised in Central Asia and Russia have lost much of their ethnic identity and have blended and assimilated into Russia and Central Asia. Kazakhstan has over 140 different ethnic groups, many of which share the experience of the Korean diaspora. As a result, the Koryo Saram are not discriminated against and are a largely accepted group within Central Asia. Many Koreans living in Kazakhstan and the former Soviet Union have married Russians and Kazakhs. As a result, most current Koreans in Central Asia are of mixed background and heritage.\n\nYounger Koryo Saram embrace their Korean past but still consider Kazakhstan to be their homeland. The older generations are concerned about the preservation of their culture and identity within Central Asia as Koreans become increasingly Russified. As a result, there has been increased interaction between South Koreans and the ex-Soviet Koreans. The Koryo Saram conduct trips to South Korea and are pushing for a revival of Korean language and culture within Kazakhstan. Some ancient Korean traditions have managed to survive the passage of time and are still practiced today, such as debating the quality of a drink before a wedding and having a toddler choose from a set of objects to determine their future. The few remaining Koryo Saram who do speak Korean are extensively studied by linguists, as they have retained and maintained an archaic Korean dialect long thought extinct.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, the newly independent Central Asian republics established diplomatic relations with both North and South Korea. Extreme economic crises in North Korea have, however, prevented it from competing with the South in developing its ties to Central Asia and the Koreans now living there.\n\nTravel between Kazakhstan and South Korea has grown significantly since the establishment of their diplomatic ties in 1992, and Korean Companies such as LG, Samsung, and Daewoo have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the economies of the former Soviet republics in Central Asia.\n\nTeachers from South Korea have traveled to Central Asia and Russia to teach at schools and universities there, and the Republic of Korea has established educational centers in Almaty, Tashkent, and Bishkek, providing Korean language courses. Diplomatic relations were established between the Republic of Korea and Kazakhstan on January 28, 1992. Bilateral trade between the nations amounted to $698 million in 2008, the main items of which are automobiles, TV and electronics goods, machinery, engineering products, uranium, ferroalloys, rolled non-alloy steel and iron, gold, and copper. Roughly 100,000 Koreans currently live in Kazakhstan.\n\n"}

The highway stretches from State Route 318 at Crystal Springs northwest to U.S. Route 6 (US 6) at Warm Springs. The route travels through mostly unoccupied desert terrain, with much of its alignment paralleling the northern edges of the Nellis Air Force Range. The road originally traversed through what is now the northern reaches of the air force range in the 1930s, when it was previously designated State Route 25A and later part of State Route 25.\n\nThe top-secret Area 51 government base is near SR 375, and many travelers have reported UFO observations and other strange alien activity along this road. Such stories prompted the state to officially designate the route as the Extraterrestrial Highway in 1996. The small town of Rachel, located near the midpoint of the highway, caters to tourists, geocachers, and UFO seekers with alien-themed businesses. Although the area receives some tourism due to alleged extraterrestrial activity, SR 375 remains a lightly traveled route.\n\nState Route 375 begins at a \"Y\" junction with State Route 318 at Crystal Springs, a ghost town in the northern end of the Pahranagat Valley in the center of Lincoln County. The site, which is little more than the junction and a few trees, functions as a rest area. From Crystal Springs, the highway curves southwest to pass between the Pahrangat and Mount Irish ranges to ascend Hancock Summit.\n\nDescending the summit, SR 375 nears the border of the Nellis Air Force Range. As the highway heads northwest through Tikaboo Valley, it meets Mail Box Road. It used to be marked by a single postal drop known as the \"black mailbox\": the dirt access road leads to the restricted lands surrounding Area 51. The original mailbox was a normal black mailbox, however due to people constantly sifting through it, it was replaced with a white one that was much more secure. The name \"Black Mailbox\" still stuck. It was commonly used as a gathering place for UFO seekers, and two to three UFO sightings per week allegedly occur in the area. The mailbox was removed by its owner, Steve Medlin, due to continued vandalism. SR 375 continues heading northwest from the mailbox, climbing in elevation again to reach the top of Coyote Summit at .\n\nWest of the summit, the Extraterrestrial Highway descends into the Sand Spring Valley and the community of Rachel becomes visible. The small town of about 50 residents is little more than homes and a few businesses. The Little A'Le'Inn (pronounced \"alien\") is the focal point of the town, providing a small motel, an alien-themed restaurant/bar, and extraterrestrial souvenirs. The civilian-run Area 51 Research Center, based out of a yellow house trailer and documenting paranormal activity in the area, closed in 2001.\n\nLeaving Rachel, SR 375 continues northwest to enter Nye County. The route climbs out of Sand Spring Valley and heads over the Queen City Summit, the highest point on the highway. After passing the summit, the route descends into the southern end of Railroad Valley, curving nearly due north for several miles as it follows the base of Reveille Range. As the mountains subside, the road turns westward again to head to its northern terminus at the junction of US 6 at Warm Springs.\n\nAn unimproved road approximating the present alignment of State Route 375 came into existence by 1932. This route, christened State Route 25A, connected Crystal Springs to State Route 4 (now US 6) just east of Tonopah. By 1933, SR 25A had been renumbered to become a new western segment of State Route 25. The route underwent periodic realignments over the next few years, but the highway's terminal junctions remained mostly unchanged.\n\nIn 1942, SR 25 appeared to have a significant gap in its route. State maps from the time show a large area within Nye and Lincoln Counties where all roads had been removed. The route existed in one piece again by 1946, although it had been realigned northward and shortened to . A sizable portion of SR 25 passing through the Tonopah U.S. Army Air Force Bombing Range (now the Nellis Air Force Range and Nevada Test Site) was restricted from public travel by 1950, the restricted section being approximately the same area that was removed in 1942. To avoid the restricted area of the testing range, the west end of SR 25 was realigned by 1957. The highway connected to US 6 at Warm Springs about east of the previous terminus, heading north around the Reveille Range instead of climbing the Kawich Range within the bombing area.\n\nWith the 1957 realignment, the routing of SR 25 attained its final form. The entire highway was paved by the following year. SR 25 remained unchanged until the 1976 renumbering of Nevada's state highways, through which the western section of SR 25 became the new State Route 375. The new route number was first seen on the 1978 edition of the official state highway map.\n\nIn 1989, an engineer named Bob Lazar claimed to have worked on alien spaceships and to have viewed saucer test flights in Tikaboo Valley, telling his story to a Las Vegas television station which was subsequently broadcast as an exclusive report. By the 1990s, stories of the top-secret U.S. government base at Area 51 had become mainstream, and many books and personal accounts had been published regarding extraterrestrial spacecraft and alien activity in the region surrounding Groom Lake. Rachel, being the closest settlement to the restricted facility, attracted people in search of UFOs and alien life. To capitalize on the purported paranormal activity along the route, the Nevada Commission on Tourism sought to rename the highway. State officials drew inspiration from the alien legends and dubbed SR 375 the Extraterrestrial Highway in February 1996. The tourism commission hoped that the renaming would \"draw travelers to the austere and remote reaches of south-central Nevada, where old atomic bomb test sites, secret Defense Department airstrips and huge, sequestered tracts of military land create a marketable mystique\".\nNews of the highway's renaming reached Twentieth Century Fox. The studio used the opportunity to promote the release of the film \"Independence Day\", whose plot involves an alien invasion of Earth and the secret facility at Area 51. A public dedication ceremony for the Extraterrestrial Highway was held in Rachel in April 1996. State dignitaries at the ceremony were joined by studio executives and \"Independence Day\" stars Jeff Goldblum, Robert Loggia, Bill Pullman, and Brent Spiner. Nevada Governor Bob Miller presided over the ceremony, speaking with humorous space references and unveiling special \"Extraterrestrial Highway 375\" and \"Speed Limit Warp 7\" signs for the highway. The event concluded with several guests placing items related to Nevada and the film into a time capsule commemorating the occasion.\n\nTo promote the Extraterrestrial Highway after its renaming, the tourism commission launched \"The ET Experience\" in July 1996. Tourists could contact the Nevada Commission on Tourism to receive a traveler's kit containing information about the highway, nearby cultural attractions, and area services. Visitors that patronized businesses in Rachel and central Nevada and submitted an account of their journey received Extraterrestrial Highway memorabilia. Stories from travelers were also published in a newsletter available to those that had completed the experience. Despite tourism generated by people searching for signs of alien life, only \"an average of about 200 cars drive some portion of the Extraterrestrial Highway every day, making it one of the state’s least traveled routes.\"\n\nIn keeping with the supposed alien links of the area, in 2006, KFC established what was said to be the first corporate logo visible from space, made from of tiles and sited just off the Extraterrestrial Highway in Rachel. The logo has since been removed.\n\n"}

After obtaining his B.A. in 1929, Haskell did a year of graduate studies at Columbia University.\n\nWhile hitchhiking during his days as an Oberlin student, Haskell met two wealthy sisters named Reynolds; they were from Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. He so impressed them with his ideas and originality that they set up a trust fund to help support him. This situation appears to have led Haskell to disdain pursuing his research within the context of conventional employment. He lived most of his life alone in a cramped and cluttered student apartment near Columbia University, purchased for him by his half-brother Douglass Haskell and sister-in-law Helen Haskell.\n\nHaskell maintained close relations with both his full and half brothers and sisters throughout his life. Married twice, in youth and in dotage, he had no children of his own. However, he would indulge his nieces and nephews with his humor, stories, violin, and yodeling. Whether climbing the mountains in the Adirondacks or Alps, Haskell's long stride had his companions running to keep up.\n\nCurious about all aspects of human nature, there was no topic that did not interest him. When other adults would tune out, Haskell would spend time with his young nephews and nieces trying to understand why they were so enthusiastic about the music of this new band, the Beatles. He listened attentively while they played the album \"Rubber Soul\" to him. Whether he got it or not, he never let on.\n\nHaskell employed the leisure afforded him by his good fortune to travel and write a book, \"Lance — A Novel about Multicultural Men\" (published in 1941) before resuming his graduate studies, this time at Harvard University and the University of Chicago. Although he became a Fellow at University of Chicago in 1940, he never completed his thesis and was not awarded the Ph.D. He left Chicago to teach sociology and anthropology at the University of Denver and Brooklyn College. In 1948, he left teaching to devote himself full-time to private research.\n\nHaskell established the Council for Unified Research and Education (C.U.R.E., Inc.) in 1948, a non-profit research organization for the unification of science and education, which he ran until it was dissolved in the mid-1980s. Among its members were Harold Cassidy, Willard Quine, Arthur Jensen, and Jere Clark. CURE's goal was the synthesis of all knowledge into a single discipline, and they established a body of work called \"The Unified Science\". Haskell was the guiding light of CURE, and the originator of most of its seminal concepts. In 1972, Haskell published his \"Full Circle — The Moral Force of Unified Science\". This book has been out of print for many years, but is now available online, gratis. The greater part of Haskell's work on Unified Science work remains unpublished.\n\nAmong the important concepts Haskell put forward were: \n\nThroughout his life, Haskell taught short courses and seminars on Unified Science at Columbia University, West Virginia University, Southern Connecticut State College, Drew University, and the New School for Social Research.\n\nHaskell died shortly after suffering an incapacitating stroke in his 79th year.\n\nThe book \"Full Circle: The Moral Force of Unified Science\" is an attempt at the unification of human knowledge. The book was edited and written by Haskell, with Harold Cassidy, Arthur Jensen, and Jere Clark each contributing a chapter. The Table of Contents is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2198203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198203", "title": "Ancient Pistol", "text": "Ancient Pistol\n\nAncient Pistol is a swaggering soldier who appears in three plays by William Shakespeare. Though full of grandiose boasts about his prowess, he is essentially a coward. The character is introduced in \"Henry IV, Part 2\" and reappears in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" and \"Henry V\".\n\nThe character's first name is never given. He is referred to as Falstaff's \"ancient\", meaning \"ensign\", or standard bearer.\n\nPistol is introduced as a \"swaggerer\" who suddenly turns up at the Boar's Head Tavern, contrary to the wishes of the hostess, Mistress Quickly. Falstaff tells her that Pistol is his \"ancient\" (ensign). He gets into a fight with Falstaff after an exchange of insults with the prostitute Doll Tearsheet, who calls him \"the foul-mouth'dst rogue in England\".\n\nLater, when Falstaff stops off at Justice Shallow's house after the defeat of Scrope, Pistol appears bringing news of the death of Henry IV, asserting that Falstaff is \"now one of the greatest men in this realm\". In another scene it is revealed that the police are after him because a man he assaulted in tandem with Doll Tearsheet and Mistress Quickly has died. He shares Falstaff's punishment of banishment from the king at the end of the play.\n\nPistol reappears as Falstaff's crony in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" and is roped into Falstaff's scheme to seduce the wives. He and his colleague Corporal Nym believe such a scheme beneath their dignity as soldiers, and refuse to participate. Falstaff dismisses them from his service and in revenge they inform the wives' husbands of Falstaff's plan, leading to Falstaff's humiliations at their hands. He also decides to pursue Mistress Quickly. Dressed as a fairy, he participates in the final scene at Herne's Oak.\n\nThe phrase \"the world's my oyster\" derives from one of Pistol's lines in the play, \"Why then the world's mine oyster, which I with sword will open.\"\n\nPistol plays a major role in \"Henry V\". He marries Mistress Quickly after the death of Falstaff, though it's also implied that he is still involved with Doll Tearsheet. In the war in France, he gets into a feud with the Welsh officer Fluellen, when Fluellen refuses to pardon Pistol's friend Bardolph who has been caught looting. In the end Fluellen beats him and forces him to eat a raw leek. At Agincourt he becomes involved in comic antics with a French soldier. After the battle he gets a letter from which he learns that \"my Doll is dead\" from \"malady of France\", i.e. from syphilis. (It is unclear whether this refers to Doll Tearsheet, or to Mistress Quickly.) He says he intends to desert, return to England and become a pimp and a thief.\n\nPistol's character may have been derived from the boastful soldier figure Il Capitano, a stock figure in \"commedia del arte\", which also has precedents in Roman comedies, in the \"Miles Gloriosus\" figure, such as Thraso in Terence's \"Eunuchus\". Pistol is the \"Elizabethan version of the \"miles gloriosus\", the braggart soldier from Roman-comedy\". Another possible source is the character Piston in Thomas Kyd's play \"Soliman and Perseda\". There are numerous puns on his name in the plays, with comic reference to his explosive temperament, tendency to misfire, and his unrestrained phallic sexuality (\"discharge upon mine hostess\").\n\nHis bombastic speeches may also be parodies of the self-dramatising heroes of Christopher Marlowe's plays. In his first scene, he misquotes one of Tamburlaine's lines from Marlowe's \"Tamburlaine the Great\". He has an \"irresistible impulse to form horrendous speeches out of half-remembered tags from old plays written in 'Cambyses vein.'\" Pistol's florid bombast is often contrasted with the gnomic pronouncements of his colleague Corporal Nym.\nIn \"Henry V\" he essentially replicates Falstaff's role in the \"Henry IV\" plays, being the butt of jokes for his empty bluster, while also parodying the rhetoric of the \"noble\" characters; however he totally lacked his superior officer's wit and charm. His role may have been expanded because Falstaff had been killed off. His antics with the French soldier are derived from those of the equivalent character (Derick) in Shakespeare's source, \"The Famous Victories of Henry V\".\n\nPistol appears in William Kenrick's play \"Falstaff's Wedding\" (1766 version), in which he escapes arrest by disguising himself as a Spanish swordsman called Antico del Pistolo, and impresses Justice Shallow. He competes with Falstaff for the hand of Mistress Ursula, but gets tricked by Shallow into marrying Mistress Quickly.\n\nJames White's book \"Falstaff's Letters\" (1796) purports to be a collection of letters written by Falstaff and his cronies, provided by a descendant of Mistress Quickly's sister. Several letters purport to have been written by Pistol in his characteristic florid style.\n\n"}

{"id": "2198232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198232", "title": "Denice Denton", "text": "Denice Denton\n\nDenice Dee Denton (August 27, 1959 – June 24, 2006) was an American professor of electrical engineering and academic administrator. She was the ninth chancellor of the University of California, Santa Cruz.\n\nDenton was born in El Campo, Texas in Wharton County. She was the oldest child of Bob Glenn Denton and Carolyn Irene Drab. Denton earned her bachelor's and master's degrees (1982), EE (1983) and PhD (1987) in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Denton spent two summers and an academic year in the late 1970s and early 1980s at Fairchild Semiconductor, where her projects included 64K static RAM design. After graduation, she accepted a professorship at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering, which was interested in her work in plasma deposition and polymerization. She was the first woman to win tenure in engineering, and she was quickly promoted to full professor.\n\nDenton held academic appointments at the University of Massachusetts Lowell and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich. In 1996, Denton was hired as the Dean of the College of Engineering and professor of electrical engineering at the University of Washington. She was the first woman in the United States to lead an engineering college of a major research university.\n\nDenton received attention for her response to Harvard President Larry Summers' suggestion, in January 2005, that one of the reasons that women had achieved less in science could be innate differences between the sexes. \"Of course he has the right to say anything and of course there are biological differences,\" Denton said. \"What some of us were concerned about is that his hypotheses were not grounded in the best and latest scholarly work, and could be refuted by anyone in the field.\"\n\nDenton was the first openly gay, and at 45, the youngest person to be appointed to be chancellor in the University of California system by UC President Robert Dynes. She succeeded Martin Chemers, who served as acting chancellor following the resignation of M. R. C. Greenwood who became the University of California Provost.\n\nDenton's recruitment package would eventually include a $275,000 salary, $68,750 as a moving allowance, improvements to the chancellor's on-campus residence which included a $30,000 dog pen initially budgeted at $7,000. Included in the deal was a tenured professorial appointment with a $192,000 salary, and a housing assistance allowance of up to $50,000 for her partner, Gretchen Kalonji.\n\nAlthough much of the residence was used for campus functions, the approximately $600,000 renovation cost, and overall cost of Denton's recruitment brought criticism. This contrasts sharply against increasing student fees, up 79 percent in four years, and low pay raises for clerical and service staff.\n\nAfter an April 2005 campus protest over these issues resulted in the arrest of 19 students, 200 faculty signed a petition condemning her \"unwarranted\" use of force. She also was allegedly a victim of personal harassment, in the form of verbal insults. A barricade was tossed through her guest-bedroom window on June 10, 2005. Protesters advocating higher wages for custodians blocked Denton in her car outside her office for about five minutes on June 6, 2006 while performing a skit about racism.\n\nOn April 5, 2005 anti-war protesters forced military recruiters at a campus career fair to leave campus. Denton received dozens of threatening phone calls and e-mails. When it was discovered that protest was listed as a \"credible threat\" on the TALON database managed by the Pentagon's Counterintelligence Field Agency, Denton helped persuade California Senators Boxer and Feinstein to request an investigation. Ultimately, campus protests were removed from the database.\n\nAfter Denton's death, astronomy and astrophysics professor George Blumenthal was named Acting Chancellor, and officially became the university's tenth Chancellor on September 19, 2007.\n\nDenton was a member of the UC President's Committee to select recipients of the Medal of Science, and the committee to select recipients of the Alan T. Waterman Award sponsored by the NSF. She was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Association for Women in Science, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). She was a member of the NSF Engineering Directorate Advisory Committee and a member of the Visiting Committee for the California Institute of Technology Division of Engineering and Applied Science. Denton served as chair of the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) Board on Engineering Education. Among many other appointments, she was a member of the NRC Committee on Advanced Materials and Fabrication Methods for Microelectromechanical Systems and of MIT's Advisory Board for Initiatives to Diversify the Professoriate. Chancellor Denton was also a member of the Board of Directors of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group and the Board of Directors of Joint Venture Silicon Valley.\n\nDenton, who was openly lesbian, resided part-time in downtown San Francisco with her partner of more than ten years, Gretchen Kalonji, a professor of materials science. On June 24, 2006, one day following Denton's discharge from the Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute where she had been treated for depression, she leapt 33 stories to her death from The Paramount, a high-rise in which she shared an apartment with Kalonji.\n\nIn August 2007 Denton's partner Gretchen Kalonji filed a lawsuit against Denton's estate seeking $2.25 million. Kalonji claims Denton's failure to revise her will or name Kalonji as a beneficiary to her UC life insurance policy was inadvertent and a violation of their oral agreement. In July 2009, a probate judge awarded Kalonji only one half of a Canadian vacation home that the coupled had shared while giving the rest of Denton's estate to Denton's parents and siblings.\n\nAmong other numerous awards she won the Maria Mitchell Women in Science Award (2006), a national recognition of exceptional work that advances opportunities in the sciences for women and girls; the NOGLSTP LGBTQ+ Educator of the Year Award (2006); the IEEE/HP Harriett B. Rigas Award (1995); the ASEE George Westinghouse Award (1995); the W. M. Keck Foundation Engineering Teaching Excellence Award (1994); the Benjamin Smith Reynolds Teaching Award (University of Wisconsin–Madison, 1994); the Eta Kappa Nu C. Holmes MacDonald Distinguished Young Electrical Engineer National Teaching Award (1993); the American Society of Engineering Education AT&T Foundation Teaching Award (1991); the Kiekhofer Distinguished Teaching Award (University of Wisconsin–Madison, 1990); and the National Science Foundation (NSF) Presidential Young Investigator Award (1987).

It is administratively part of the Central and Western District.\n\nIn Cantonese, \"Sai\" () means \"west\" and \"Ying Pun\" () means \"camp\", especially a military camp. It was where the early British military stayed.\n\nSai Ying Pun is built on the steeply sloping lower slopes of Victoria Peak and also on the western reclamation. The areas of Shek Tong Tsui and Kennedy Town are located to the west, Sheung Wan and Tai Ping Shan are to the east, and the Mid-Levels is higher up the hill to the south. Victoria Harbour is to the north.\n\nWhile the boundaries are not \"de jure\" drawn, they are nevertheless \"de facto\" defined by Whitty Street in the west and Tung Wah Hospital in the east. The University of Hong Kong MTR Station exit B1 straddles the boundary between Shek Tong Tsui and Sai Ying Pun. Good Luck Mansion and The Kadoorie Biological Sciences Building are in Shek Tong Tsui, while Saint Anthony's Church, Pao Siu Loong Building, and the Main Building are in Sai Ying Pun. \n\nThe eastern boundary is blurry. Lok Sin Tong Leung Kau Kui College is in Sai Ying Pun while Tung Wah Hospital is in Sheung Wan. The section of Queens Road West from Medal Court to Hollywood Road marks part of the boundary. Elsewhere, the location of the border is unknown. On a map, Sai Ying Pun can be distinguished from Sheung Wan because it is left of the street grid of the Tai Ping Shan neighborhood.\n\nSai Ying Pun is built on top of Hong Kong granite. The granite was formed in the Upper Jurassic Period and is from the last phase of intrusions in the Hong Kong area. The granite is found over most of the north and centre of Hong Kong Island, and also Kowloon. The flat parts of Sai Ying Pun near the harbour are reclaimed land, built from landfill.\n\nQueen's Road was the first road built in the area. It meandered around the camp structures and extended along the north coast of Hong Kong Island.\n\nSai Ying Pun was settled as Chinese immigrants moved into Hong Kong and built to the west of Tai Ping Shan. Europeans were assigned areas above High Street where Chinese were excluded from living.\n\nIn the early 1880s sewerage was installed into the area, with the main flow coming down Centre Street. Streets were also macadamised or concreted at this time.\n\nAround 1882 Battery Road was renamed Bonham Road.\n\nFrom 1884 to 1887 many brothels were declared by the Government to be unlicensed and closed down. These were mainly in First, Second and Third Street, but also in Sheung Fung Lane, Ui On Lane and Centre Street.\n\nIn 1894 an epidemic of bubonic plague struck and afflicted Sai Ying Pun residents. It was not initially as bad as in neighbouring Tai Ping Shan, which was abandoned and demolished to improve hygiene. However Sheung Fung Lane residents were almost wiped out. Government reports called this area the number IX health district and went into great detail about the buildings where the disease occurred. In 1896 there were 115 cases, in 1898, 153 cases, in 1899, 263 cases, in 1900 98 cases, in 1904 there were 149 cases with 144 dying, and 55 cases in 1905. The great majority of infections in this district resulted in death.\n\nIn 1902, number 10 and 12 Second Street partially collapsed killing four people and injuring six. An additional storey had been added to number 10 at the beginning of 1901. It fell on number 12 and caused it to collapse as well. The extension had been designed by architects Denison and Ram. Also in 1902 a cookhouse at 56 First Street collapsed, one person was killed.\n\nIn 1899, there were 1017 houses and a population estimate of 24800. Most houses in Des Voeux Road and First Street were three stories, and in Second and Third Street they were two stories. In 1904 population was 24900 and average occupancy per floor of each house was 8.9. In 1905 the population was 25083.\n\nIn 1903, most houses were made from soft blue bricks, they had basements, and retaining walls at the front and back due to the steep slope.\n\nIn the early 1900s there was a Berlin Foundling House in High Street, a Sailors Home, and a Lunatic Asylum.\n\n\nThere are many small lanes in Sai Ying Pun, mostly open only to pedestrians. They had more importance in historical times when they were used to access many houses. Now they are mainly cross connects and back alleys. Some lanes are private, and some may have disappeared. The interest nowadays is in their names, as very few places now have addresses in them.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade 1\n\nGrade 2\n\nGrade 3\n\nSai Ying Pun station, which is one of the MTR stations and part of Hong Kong Island line, started servicing the area on 29 March 2015. Trams run along Des Voeux Road West, taking passengers to the east or west of Hong Kong Island.\n\nMany bus routes run along Des Voeux Road and Queens Road West, with some routes routed through the lower parts of Water Street and Pok Fu Lam Road. Most streets are too steep or narrow for buses, however green minibuses and some red minibus routes travel through the upper streets.\n\nTaxis frequent First, Second and Third Streets.\n\nA series of escalators can take pedestrians up Centre Street, from Second Street to Bonham Road via the Sai Ying Pun Market.\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel goes from Sai Ying Pun under Victoria Harbour to West Kowloon, and is a popular route for cars, trucks and buses.\n\n"}

The urban legend is based outside of Resurrection Cemetery in Justice, Illinois, a few miles southwest of Chicago. Resurrection Mary is considered to be Chicago's most famous ghost.\n\nSince the 1930s, several men driving northeast along Archer Avenue between the Willowbrook Ballroom and Resurrection Cemetery have reported picking up a young female hitchhiker. This young woman is dressed somewhat formally in a white party dress and is said to have light blond hair and blue eyes. There are other reports that she wears a thin shawl, dancing shoes, carries a small clutch purse, and possibly that she is very quiet. When the driver nears the Resurrection Cemetery, the young woman asks to be let out, whereupon she disappears into the cemetery. According to the \"Chicago Tribune\", \"full-time ghost hunter\" Richard Crowe has collected \"three dozen ... substantiated\" reports of Mary from the 1930s to the present.\n\nThe story goes that Mary had spent the evening dancing with a boyfriend at the Oh Henry Ballroom. At some point, they got into an argument and Mary stormed out.\n\nShe left the ballroom and started walking up Archer Avenue. She had not gotten very far when she was struck and killed by a hit-and-run driver, who fled the scene leaving Mary to die. Her parents found her and were grief-stricken at the sight of her dead body. They buried her in Resurrection Cemetery, wearing a beautiful white dancing dress and matching dancing shoes. The hit-and-run driver was never found.\n\nJerry Palus, a Chicago southsider, reported that in 1939 he met a person whom he came to believe was Resurrection Mary at the Liberty Grove and Hall at 47th and Mozart (and \"not\" the Oh Henry/Willowbrook Ballroom). They danced and even kissed and she asked him to drive her home along Archer Avenue, exiting the car and disappearing in front of Resurrection Cemetery.\nIn 1973, Resurrection Mary was said to have shown up at Harlow's nightclub, on Cicero Avenue on Chicago's southwest side. That same year, a cab driver came into Chet's Melody Lounge, across the street from Resurrection Cemetery, to inquire about a young lady who had left without paying her fare.\n\nThere were said to be sightings in 1976, 1978, 1980, and 1989, which involved cars striking, or nearly striking, Mary outside Resurrection Cemetery. Mary disappears, however, by the time the motorist exits the car.\n\nShe also reportedly burned her handprints into the wrought iron fence around the cemetery, in August 1976, although officials at the cemetery have stated that a truck had damaged the fence and that there is no evidence of a ghost.\n\nIn a January 31, 1979 article in the \"Suburban Trib\", columnist Bill Geist detailed the story of a cab driver, Ralph, who picked up a young woman – \"a looker. A blond. ... she was young enough to be my daughter — 21 tops\" – near a small shopping center on Archer Avenue.\n\nGeist described Ralph as \"not an idiot or a maniac\" but rather, in Ralph's own words, \"a typical 52-year-old working guy, a veteran, father, Little League baseball coach, churchgoer, the whole shot\". Geist goes on to say: \"The simple explanation, Ralph, is that you picked up the Chicago area's preeminent ghost: Resurrection Mary.\"\n\nSome researchers have attempted to link Resurrection Mary to one of the many thousands of burials in Resurrection Cemetery. A particular focus of these efforts has been Mary Bregovy, who died in 1934, although her death came in an automobile accident in the downtown Chicago Loop Chicago author Ursula Bielski in 1999 documented a possible connection to Anna \"Marija\" Norkus, who died in a 1927 auto accident while on her way home from the Oh Henry Ballroom, a theory which has gained popularity in recent years.\n\nThe bluegrass band The Country Gentlemen included a song entitled \"Bringing Mary Home\" on their 1966 album of the same name. In it, the singer picks up a \"little girl\" named Mary who directs him to a house rather than the cemetery, though she vanishes from his car in the same manner as Resurrection Mary. The driver explains the situation to the home's owner, who tells him that Mary died in a car accident thirteen years before and that he is not the first person to give her a ride home. This version has been covered many times, including versions by Red Sovine and Mac Wiseman.\n\nOn his 1996 album \"The Artful Dodger\", singer/songwriter Ian Hunter included the song \"Resurrection Mary\", in which a driver in or near Chicago picks up a beautiful young woman with an \"incandescent glow\" who says to him \"I'm tryin' to get to Heaven/Can you tell me where that is?\"\n\nThree films titled \"Resurrection Mary\" and based on the legend have been released: one in 2002 starring Wilford Brimley, one in 2005 featuring Joe Estevez and one in 2007.All three films portray Mary as a sinister or vengeful spirit.\n\nThe legend of Resurrection Mary was featured twice on \"Unsolved Mysteries\": once in Episode 2 of Season 3, in a segment titled \"Resurrection Mary,\" in 1990, and once on Episode 15 of Season 6, in a segment titled \"One for the Road,\" in 1994.\n\n"}

It has been called white supremacist by the Associated Press and Anti-Defamation League, among others. Richard Barrett was succeeded by unanimous vote as leader by Thomas Reiter after Barrett's murder. Its Secretary originally was Barry Hackney, and the position of Secretary was discontinued by Thomas Reiter. Thomas Reiter saved most Nationalist Movement assets and intellectual property after Barrett's murder. The symbol of the movement is the Crosstar. In 2012 with the endorsement of Thomas Reiter, Travis Golie was sworn in as the Leader of The Nationalist Movement. Like Reiter, Golie was an original Barrett-era Nationalist Movement member. Golie returned The Nationalist Movement headquarters to the South where it originated.\n\nIn 1987 the movement applied for 501(c)(3) non-profit status. This status was denied due to the organization's use of resources for non-charitable purposes. The movement filed a lawsuit challenging the decision on constitutional grounds, but was defeated. The movement was active in protests against Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in Atlanta, Georgia in 1989. Its \"Neighborhood, Home, Family and Country\" parade and rally in South Boston drew crowds and police. It held a demonstration in Simi Valley, California in 1992, in defense of the police officers accused of beating Rodney King. In 1993, it held a \"Majority-Rights Freedom Rally\" at the Colorado State Capitol, in opposition to gay rights.\n\nIn 1992, it won in the United States Supreme Court, in \"Forsyth County, Georgia v. The Nationalist Movement\", establishing new First Amendment jurisprudence, which lifted bans on its use of public property and mandated police protection for its parades and rallies. It was sued in 1993 by the Texas Human Rights Commission, alleging that it violated the federal housing bill, but it won the case and had prohibitions against free speech stricken from federal housing regulations. It is financed by donations of members and occasional court-awarded damages from opponents. It sees itself as policing the ranks of nationalists, often supporting the prosecution of white supremacists, such as Matthew Hale and David Duke.\n\nCrosstar, the website of the Nationalist Movement, was launched on June 13, 1996. Richard Barrett served as administrator from its founding until his death in 2010 at which time Thomas Reiter was unanimously elected as First Officer and Administrator of Crosstar. On November 11, 2011, the site relaunched in a modern, social network format. The site ceased operation in 2016.\n\n\"All The Way\" was the official organ of the Nationalist Movement from 1987 to 1996, published monthly at Learned, Mississippi. Correspondents included Travis Golie, Barry Hackney and Gerald McManus.\n\nIt was founded in June 1987. Richard Barrett served as editor from its founding until his death in 2010. In 1996, the publication migrated to the Internet, appearing in both print and online versions.\n\nThe newspaper maintained editorial policies in favor of what it termed \"majority-rule democracy.\" It reported current events from a white supremacist standpoint, including appeals from Marines and others to get out of Iraq and Afghanistan. \"All The Way\" showcased white supremacists, notably Edgar Ray Killen, and billed itself as \"the longest-running continually published nationalist newspaper.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2198247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198247", "title": "Elastica", "text": "Elastica\n\nElastica were a British rock band formed in London in 1992. The band were influenced by punk rock, post-punk and new wave music. They are best known for their 1995 album \"Elastica\", which produced singles that charted in the United Kingdom and the United States, including their highest-charting US Hot 100 hit \"Connection\". They split amicably in 2001, roughly a year after releasing their second LP.\n\nIn mid-1992, ex-Suede band members Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch decided to form a group. By the autumn of that year, bassist Annie Holland and guitarist Donna Matthews were added. After initially gigging under names such as \"Onk\", the band settled on the name \"Elastica\" in October 1992. Elastica released their first single, \"Stutter\", in October 1993, which benefited from the promotional efforts of BBC Radio 1 DJ and Deceptive Records label boss Steve Lamacq, who had discovered the band earlier in the year. In 1994, Elastica released two UK Top 20 singles (\"Line Up\" and \"Connection\") and performed on numerous radio shows. In addition, Frischmann's relationship with Blur frontman Damon Albarn made tabloid headlines.\n\nElastica's first LP, \"Elastica\", was released in March 1995, and entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 1; it became the fastest-selling debut album since Oasis' \"Definitely Maybe\". This record was held for over ten years, until it was surpassed by the Arctic Monkeys' debut \"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\" in 2006. The album was preceded by their fourth single \"Waking Up\" which went to No. 13 on the UK Singles Chart, their highest placing therein.\n\nThe band became subject to controversy when several bands sued them for plagiarism. Specifically, the art punk band Wire (whom Elastica counted as one of their main influences) claimed that many of the band's melodies were taken from Wire compositions, as well as by the Stranglers. Notably, Wire's \"I Am the Fly\" has a chorus similar to Elastica's \"Line Up\" and the intro synthesizer part in Elastica's \"Connection\" (later also repeated on guitar) is lifted from the guitar riff in Wire's \"Three Girl Rhumba\" and transposed a semitone, and the Stranglers also passed comment that Elastica's \"Waking Up\" bore a marked resemblance to their song \"No More Heroes\". The disputes were resolved by out-of-court settlements.\n\nThe mid-90s witnessed another \"British Invasion\" in America. \"Stutter\" and \"Connection\" received airplay on modern rock radio and both charted on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at nos 67 and 53 respectively; their debut album also charted and was later certified gold). After performing at the 1995 Glastonbury Festival, the band joined the Lollapalooza tour continuing an almost solid year of constant gigs where they toured North America four times. Citing exhaustion, Annie Holland quit the band in early August 1995 and was replaced for the remainder of the tour by session bassist Abby Travis. Holland was not permanently replaced until the arrival of Sheila Chipperfield in the spring of 1996. Around this time, keyboardist David Bush (ex-the Fall) was added to the line-up.\n\nAfter playing more shows and demoing new material in the first half of 1996, Elastica entered the studio in the later part of the year to begin work on their second album. By late 1998 Matthews had left the band. She was replaced by guitarist Paul Jones (of the band Linoleum) and keyboardist Sharon Mew. Around this time, Chipperfield was replaced by the returning Annie Holland.\n\nAs a tribute to the \"lost years\" of the band, a self-titled six-track EP appeared in August 1999, collecting a variety of recordings from a multitude of aborted sessions. This EP marked the first new material from the band in over four years. After re-recording most of these songs in mid-1999, along with new compositions, the band played their first set of shows in years. Their second proper album, \"The Menace\", was released in April 2000. After the release of the farewell single \"The Bitch Don't Work\" in 2001, the band announced their amicable break-up.\n\nIn 2005, Frischmann emigrated to Boulder, Colorado, and studied art at Naropa University. She had begun working as an artist by 2008, and later moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. Matthews is a pastor in Totnes, and according to a recent BBC 6 show has been linked romantically to Lawrence Chandler of Bowery Electric. Holland lives in Brighton. Welch and Mew are married, and live in Hastings. Welch played drums for Lush's 2015-16 reunion shows. Jones is the A&R man at Rough Trade joining after managing his Slogan label, which released the Fall's \"Fall Heads Roll\". He signed the group Warpaint.\n\nOn 21 January 2017, the band's official Facebook page posted photos featuring three-quarters of the original line-up – Matthews, Holland and Welch – during a visit to Abbey Road Studios in London. They were working on a remaster of their debut \"Elastica\" with Mastering engineer Sean McGee. Frischmann also worked on the remaster. The record was reissued in April on Record Store Day.\n\nPast members\n\nGuest/Touring musicians\n\n"}

Sarah's father, William Pink (died 1853), also settled in Adelaide, and was employed as a labourer in the Survey of South Australia. \nTom Cox Bray had a boot and shoe factory at 79 Hindley Street, Adelaide from 1840 to 1856, when he and his family returned to England. He had the good fortune to be one of the \"Snobs\" (i.e. tradesmen) who risked their savings on shares in the South Australian Mining Association copper mine at Burra, and made handsome profits.\n\nJohn was the second of their four sons (with two daughters), all born in Adelaide.\nEducated at St. Peter's College and in England, Bray read law in South Australia, being articled to W. T. Foster, and was called to the South Australian Bar in November 1870.\n\nHe joined the able lawyer J. B. Sheridan in partnership as Bray and Sheridan, but his mercurial temperament made him ill-suited to the practice of law, but he had the wit and debating skills for a life of politics.\n\nMeanwhile, his parents, elder brother and sisters returned to England, due to an improvement in their circumstances said to be the result of T.C. Bray's having inherited shipping interests from his paternal grandfather, possibly George Bray (elsewhere called Charles Bray), who had disapproved of his son's marriage to Ann Cox (1789–1840), later Winship, daughter of a farmer from Southsea, Hampshire. Once in England, the family lived in comfort first at Blackheath in Kent, and later at Harrogate, the Yorkshire spa town in which Mrs Bray died. The elder son, Thomas William Bray (1840–1887), was sent to Clare College, Cambridge, and later became an Anglican clergyman. He was father of Sir Denys Bray (1875–1951), K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., C.B.E., sometime Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, and Indian delegate to the League of Nations during the British colonial period.\n\nT.C. Bray lived the rest of his life as a gentleman, moving to Kilmacolm, Renfrewshire in Scotland, where he had descendants in the mid-1980s. He died in Scotland and his will was proved in Scotland and South Australia. Descendants include Sir John Henry Kerr, colonial governor in India, David Russell, classical guitarist, and Piers Sellers, astronaut.\n\nIn Adelaide, J.C. Bray practised law only briefly, as a solicitor, before being elected to the South Australian House of Assembly as M.P. for East Adelaide on 14 December 1871, a constituency he held until his retirement from politics on 6 January 1892.\n\nBray served as Minister of Justice and Minister of Education in the 3rd Blyth ministry (15 March 1875 – 3 June 1875). He also served as Attorney-General of South Australia (June 1876 – 26 October 1877) in the Colton ministry, when he was responsible for introducing an \"Act to Provide for the formation and registration of trades unions\", the first such legislation in Australia. He served as Leader of the Opposition to the Morgan ministry (October 1877 – 24 June 1881), and Premier and Chief Secretary of the Province of South Australia (24 June 1881 – 23 April 1884), and Premier and Treasurer of South Australia (23 April 1884 – 16 June 1884). At the time, he was the longest-serving premier of the colony.\n\nThe Bray Government in 1883 petitioned the Home Government for absolute control of the Northern Territory, put in 1865 under the administration of South Australia, but on the ground that at some future time it might be necessary to erect a separate colony in the north their request was refused.\n\nHe visited England and the United States from 1884 to 1885, returning to serve as Chief Secretary of South Australia (14 October 1885 – June 1887), and Treasurer (8 June 1886 – 7 June 1887) in the 1st Downer ministry. He was acting Premier during Downer's absence in England until June 1887. Due to his popularity, Bray was elected Speaker of the South Australian House of Assembly (served 31 May 1888 – June 1890), after which he refused renomination to that office. He was Chief Secretary in the 2nd Playford ministry (19 August 1890 – 6 January 1892), when he left politics, sparking the East Adelaide by-election, which saw the first Labor MP elected in South Australian history.\n\nBray attended the Sydney Intercolonial Conference in 1883, and was one of seven South Australian representatives at the first Federal Convention at Sydney in 1891.\n\nBray was appointed Agent General for South Australia in London (served 29 February 1892 – April 1894), resigning early because of ill health.\n\nOn 13 June 1894, he died at sea between Aden and Colombo aboard the \"Oceana\" en route for South Australia. His obituary appeared in The Times (London) of 19 June 1894.\n\nBray was created a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) by Queen Victoria in the New Year's Honours List for 1890. His wife, Alice Maude née Hornabrook, Lady Bray, (1850 – 13 July 1935), whom he married in 1870, survived him. They had three sons and one daughter.\n\nBray's descendants continue to include people prominent in Australian politics and the Australian judiciary.\n\nBray was the first native-born South Australian to serve as premier, speaker, and agent-general for the colony.\n\n"}
{"id": "2198261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198261", "title": "Edwin Walker", "text": "Edwin Walker\n\nEdwin Anderson Walker (November 10, 1909 – October 31, 1993) — known as Ted Walker — was a United States Army officer who served in World War II and the Korean War. He became known for his staunch conservative political opinions and was criticized by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower for promoting a personal political opinion while in uniform. Walker resigned his commission in 1959, but Eisenhower refused to accept his resignation and gave Walker a new command of the 24th Infantry Division in Augsburg, Germany. Walker again resigned his commission in 1961 after being publicly and formally admonished by the Joint Chiefs of Staff for allegedly referring to Eleanor Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman as \"pink\" in print and for violating the Hatch Act of 1939 by attempting to influence the votes of his troops. President John F. Kennedy accepted his resignation, making Walker the only US general to resign in the 20th century.\n\nIn early 1962, Walker campaigned to become governor of Texas and lost the Democratic primary election to the eventual winner, John Connally. In October 1962, Walker was arrested for promoting riots at the University of Mississippi in protest against the admission of black student James Meredith into the all-white university. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy ordered Walker committed to a mental asylum for a 90-day evaluation, but psychiatrist Thomas Szasz protested and Walker was released in five days. Attorney Robert Morris convinced a Mississippi grand jury not to indict Walker.\n\nWalker was the target of an assassination attempt at his home on April 10, 1963, but escaped serious injury when a bullet fired from outside hit a window frame and fragmented. After its investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the Warren Commission concluded that Walker's assailant had been Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\nWalker was born in the community of Center Point in Kerr County, Texas, in the Texas Hill Country. He graduated in 1927 from the New Mexico Military Institute. He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, from which he graduated in 1931.\n\nWalker's experience was as an artilleryman, but in World War II he commanded a sub-unit of the Canadian-American First Special Service Force. Walker began command of one of the force's three regiments while still in the United States, and commanded the 3rd Regiment throughout its time in Italy. Their first combat actions began in December 1943, and after battling through the Winter Line, the force was withdrawn for redeployment to the Anzio beachhead in early 1944. After the fight for Rome in June 1944, the force was withdrawn again to prepare for Operation Dragoon. In August 1944, Walker succeeded Robert T. Frederick as the unit's second, and last, commanding officer. The FSSF landed on the Islands of Hyeres off the French Riviera in the autumn of 1944, defeating a strong German garrison. Walker commanded the FSSF when it was disbanded in early 1945.\n\nWalker experienced combat during the Korean War, commanding the Third Infantry Division's 7th Infantry Regiment and serving as a senior advisor to the army of the Republic of Korea.\n\nWalker was then assigned as commander of the Arkansas Military District in Little Rock, Arkansas. In 1957, he implemented an order by President Eisenhower to quell civil disturbances related to the desegregation of Little Rock's Central High School. Osro Cobb, the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, recalls that Walker \n\n\"made it clear from the outset ... that he would do any and everything necessary to see that the black students attended Central High School as ordered by the federal court... he would arrange protection for them and their families, if necessary, and also supervise their transportation to and from the school for their safety.\"\nWalker repeatedly protested to Eisenhower that using federal troops to enforce racial integration was against his conscience. Although he obeyed orders and successfully integrated Little Rock High School, he began listening to segregationist preacher Billy James Hargis and oil tycoon H. L. Hunt, whose anti-communist radio program \"Life Line\" was funded by conservative activist and publisher Dan Smoot. Anti-communist activists in the late 1950s claimed that communists controlled important parts of the U.S. government and the United Nations, and that some Soviet spies and agents occupied prominent jobs within the federal government, for example, some of the Silvermaster group.\n\nIn 1959, Walker met publisher Robert Welch. Welch founded the John Birch Society to promote his anti-communist opinions, one of which was that President Eisenhower was a communist. This assertion surprised Walker because it coincided with the segregationist argument of Reverend Billy James Hargis that the civil-rights movement was a communist plot.\n\nOn August 4, 1959, Walker submitted his resignation to the U.S. Army. President Eisenhower denied Walker's request for resignation and offered him command over more than 10,000 troops in Augsburg, Germany, specifically the 24th Infantry Division, which Walker accepted. He began promoting his \"Pro-Blue\" indoctrination program for troops, which included a reading list of materials by Hargis and the John Birch Society.\n\nThe name \"Pro-Blue\", said Walker, was intended to suggest \"anti-red.\" He later wrote that the Pro-Blue program was based upon his experiences in Korea, where he saw \"hastily mobilized and deployed soldiers 'bug out' in the face of Communist units with inferior equipment and often smaller numbers. American soldiers, unprepared for the psychological battlefield, needed to know why they had to beat the enemy as well as the how.\"\n\nPromoting the Pro-Blue program brought Walker into conflict with the \"Overseas Weekly\", a tabloid newspaper. On April 16, 1961, the \"Overseas Weekly\" published an article accusing Walker of indoctrinating his troops with John Birch Society materials.\n\nBecause the John Birch Society regularly claimed that all U.S. presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt onward had been communists, its opinions were considered too controversial politically for a U.S. general to advocate; military officers were not supposed to engage in politics at all. Walker was quoted by the \"Overseas Weekly\" as saying that Harry S. Truman, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Secretary of State Dean Acheson were \"definitely pink.\" Additionally, a number of soldiers had complained that Walker was instructing them how to vote in the forthcoming American election by using the \"Conservative Voting Index\", which was biased toward the Republican Party. According to Walker, the allegations accusing him of providing voting instructions to soldiers would later be disproved. The allegation was based on an article in the division newspaper that provided instructions for filling out absentee ballots.\n\nThe day after the \"Overseas Weekly\" story was published, Walker was relieved of his command by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, while an inquiry was conducted. In October, Walker was reassigned to Hawaii to become assistant chief of staff for training and operations in the Pacific region.\n\nWalker chose to resign from the army a second time. The Secretary of the Army chose to admonish him, a less severe punishment than a reprimand and one that Walker could not appeal. The secretary also stated that Walker would not be permitted to command VIII Corps, as the president had withdrawn his name for promotion. In protest, Walker, preferring political activism to his 30-year military career, did not retire but resigned, thereby forfeiting his pension. This time, President Kennedy accepted his resignation. \nWalker said: \"It will be my purpose now, as a civilian, to attempt to do what I have found it no longer possible to do in uniform.\"\n\nDuring December 1961, as a civilian, Walker began a career making political speeches along with Hargis. Walker enjoyed enthusiastic crowds all over the United States and his anti-communist message was popular. He also promoted the McCarthyist belief that communists were inside the United States government. Walker's home base was Dallas, Texas, considered a conservative city. He received considerable assistance from the citizens of Dallas, in particular from oil billionaire, publisher and radio host H. L. Hunt, who assisted Walker's first election campaign for governor of Texas. A \"Newsweek\" cover proclaimed Walker the public face of the anti-communist conservative movement.\n\nIn February 1962, Walker began his campaign for governor, but finished last among six candidates in a Democratic primary election. The winner in a runoff election was John B. Connally, Jr., the choice of Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. Other contenders were Governor Price Daniel, Highway Commissioner Marshall Formby of Plainview, Attorney General of Texas Will Wilson, and Houston lawyer Don Yarborough, the favorite of liberals and organized labor. Because of disfranchisement of minorities in Texas since the beginning of the century, Democratic Party primaries were the only strongly competitive political contests in the state at that time. In the course of his campaign, Walker assaulted journalist Thomas V. Kelly (father of \"New York Times\" editor Michael Kelly), who had asked him for a response to praise of Walker made by American Nazi Party leader George Lincoln Rockwell; Walker's response was to strike Kelly in the left eye. This assault was widely reported in the press.\n\nThough Walker had obeyed orders during the desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock, he acted privately in organizing protests in September 1962 against the enrollment of James Meredith, an African-American veteran, at the all-white University of Mississippi.\n\nOn September 26, 1962, Walker broadcast this message on several radio stations:\n\nMississippi: It is time to move. We have talked, listened and been pushed around far too much by the anti-Christ Supreme Court! Rise...to a stand beside Governor Ross Barnett at Jackson, Mississippi! Now is the time to be heard! Thousands strong from every State in the Union! Rally to the cause of freedom! The Battle Cry of the Republic! Barnett yes! Castro no! Bring your flag, your tent and your skillet. It's now or never! The time is when the President of the United States commits or uses any troops, Federal or State, in Mississippi! The last time in such a situation I was on the wrong side. That was in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1957-1958. This time -- out of uniform -- I am on the right side! I will be there! \nOn September 29, 1962, he issued a televised statement:\n\nThis is Edwin A. Walker. I am in Mississippi beside Governor Ross Barnett. I call for a national protest against the conspiracy from within. Rally to the cause of freedom in righteous indignation, violent vocal protest, and bitter silence under the flag of Mississippi at the use of Federal troops. This today is a disgrace to the nation in 'dire peril,' a disgrace beyond the capacity of anyone except its enemies. This is the conspiracy of the crucifixion by anti-Christ conspirators of the Supreme Court in their denial of prayer and their betrayal of a nation.\nWhite segregationists from around the state joined students and locals in a violent, 15-hour riot on the campus on September 30. Two people were killed execution-style, hundreds were wounded, and six federal marshals were shot. Walker was arrested on four federal charges, including sedition and insurrection against the United States. He was temporarily detained in a mental institution on orders from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Kennedy demanded that Walker receive a 90-day psychiatric examination.\n\nThe attorney general's decision was challenged by noted psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, who insisted that psychiatry must never become used for political rivalry. The American Civil Liberties Union joined Szasz in a protest against the attorney general, completing this coalition of liberal and conservative leaders. The attorney general had to relent, and Walker spent only five days in the asylum.\n\nWalker posted bond and returned home to Dallas, where he was greeted by a crowd of some 200 devotees. After a federal grand jury adjourned in January 1963 without indicting him, the charges were dismissed. Because the dismissal of the charges was without prejudice, the charges could have been reinstated within five years.\n\nIn February 1963, Walker joined Billy Hargis on an anti-communist tour named \"Operation Midnight Ride\". In a speech Walker made on March 5, reported in the \"Dallas Times Herald\", he called on the United States military to \"liquidate the [communist] scourge that has descended upon the island of Cuba.\" Seven days later, Lee Harvey Oswald ordered a Carcano rifle by mail, using the alias \"A. Hidell\".\n\nAccording to the Warren Commission, Oswald began to put Walker under surveillance, photographing the general's Dallas home on the weekend of March 9–10. Oswald's friend, 51-year-old Russian émigré and petroleum geologist George de Mohrenschildt, would later tell the Warren Commission that he \"knew that Oswald disliked General Walker.\"\n\nOn April 10, 1963, as Walker was sitting at a desk in his dining room, a bullet struck the wooden frame of his dining-room window. Walker was injured in the forearm by fragments. Marina Oswald later testified that her husband had told her that he traveled by bus to General Walker's house and shot at Walker with his rifle. Marina said that Oswald considered Walker to be the leader of a \"fascist organization.\"\n\nBefore the Kennedy assassination, the Dallas police did not have any suspects for the Walker shooting, but Oswald's involvement was suspected within hours of his arrest. A note that Oswald left for Marina on the night of the attempt, telling her what to do if he did not return, was not found until ten days after the assassination. The bullet was too badly damaged to provide conclusive ballistics tests, but neutron activation analysis tests later determined that it was \"extremely likely\" the bullet was a Carcano bullet manufactured by the Western Cartridge Company, the same ammunition used in the Kennedy assassination.\n\nPolice detective D. E. McElroy commented, \"Whoever shot at the general was playing for keeps. The sniper wasn't trying to scare him. He was shooting to kill.\" Marina Oswald stated later that she had seen Oswald burn most of his plans in the bathtub, though she hid the note that he had left for her in a cookbook, with the intention of bringing it to the police should Oswald again attempt to kill Walker or anyone else. Marina later quoted her husband as saying, \"Well, what would you say if somebody got rid of Hitler at the right time? So if you don't know about General Walker, how can you speak up on his behalf?\"\n\nOswald later wrote to Arnold Johnson of the Communist Party USA that on the evening of October 23, 1963, he had attended an \"ultra right\" meeting directed by Walker.\n\nOn November 29, 1963, one week following the Kennedy assassination, an article appeared in an extreme-right German newspaper, \"Deutsche National-Zeitung,\" that accused Oswald of having committed the attack on Walker. Marina Oswald was asked about the report during a two-week-long detention in which she was interrogated by federal investigators, and she said that she believed that the report was true. Among skeptics of the Warren Commission's investigation into the Kennedy assassination, there is some question about how a European newspaper with no significant presence in the United States was able to receive information about a rather obscure American crime. However, by the time that the connection between Oswald and Walker came to light, Oswald had died while in police custody, so no charges were ever filed for the crime.\n\nWalker organized a verbal attack on Adlai Stevenson, US ambassador to the United Nations, on UN Day, October 24, 1963, in Dallas. In mid-October 1963, Walker rented the same Dallas Memorial Auditorium in which Stevenson would speak. He advertised his opposing event as \"US Day\" and he invited members of the John Birch Society, the National Indignation Convention, the Minutemen and other organizations opposed to communism and the United Nations.\n\nOn the night before Stevenson's speech, Walker had his \"US Day\" rally and instructed his audience to \"buy all the tickets\" they could afford for the Stevenson speech, and to fill the auditorium. Walker instructed his audience to heckle Stevenson, bring Halloween noisemakers, and recite their own speeches in the hallways in order to disrupt Stevenson's speech in any way that they could.\n\nWalker also told his devotees to fix a banner to the ceiling, to be unfurled at the appropriate moment. It was to be printed with \"US out of UN!,\" and on the other side, \"UN out of US!\" Walker did not attend Stevenson's speech, nor did he take credit for the orchestration. The audience was so disruptive that Stevenson quit speaking before finishing his presentation and went quickly out to his limousine. On his way, a protester spat at him and one struck him in the head with her placard. Both were arrested. Walker was not charged, although his role was well-known at the time.\n\nThe verbal attacks on Stevenson were traced to plans organized by Walker and his devotees in the John Birch Society, according to the November issue of the magazine \"Texas Observer\". One month later, the black-bordered advertisement in the \"Dallas Morning News\" and the \"Wanted for Treason: JFK\" handbills of November 22, 1963 appeared on the streets of Dallas. They were traced to Walker and his associate Robert Surrey by the Warren Commission. After the assassination, Walker wrote and spoke publicly about his belief that there were two assassins at the \"April Crime\", Oswald and another person who was never found.\n\nImmediately after the Warren Commission released its report in September 1964, Walker described it as a \"farcical whitewash.\" Although he accepted the commission's finding that it was Oswald who had shot at him the previous year, Walker claimed that the commission was attempting to hide \"some sort of conspiracy\" that included an association between Jack Ruby and Oswald.\n\nAngered by negative publicity, Walker began to file libel lawsuits against various media outlets. One suit responded to negative coverage of his role in the riot at the University of Mississippi protesting Meredith's admission. The Associated Press reported that Walker had \"led a charge of students against federal marshals\" and that he had \"assumed command of the crowd.\" Several newspapers were named in the lawsuit. If Walker and his lawyers were successful, he could have won tens of millions of dollars.\n\nA 1964 Texas trial court found the statements false and defamatory.\nBy that time, Walker and his lawyers had already won more than $3 million in lawsuits.\n\nThe Associated Press appealed the decision as \"Associated Press v. Walker\", eventually to the United States Supreme Court, where it was consolidated with \"Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts\". In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled against Walker, finding that, although the statements may have been false, the Associated Press was not guilty of reckless disregard in its reporting about Walker. The court, which had previously said that public officials could not recover damages unless they could prove malice, extended this to public figures as well.\n\nBy resigning instead of retiring, Walker was ineligible for an army pension. He made statements at the time to the \"Dallas Morning News\" that he had \"refused\" his pension. However, he had made several previous requests for his pension dating back to 1973. The army restored his pension rights in 1982.\n\nWalker, at age 66, was arrested on June 23, 1976 for public lewdness in a restroom at a Dallas park. He was accused of fondling and propositioning a male undercover police officer. He was arrested again in Dallas for public lewdness on March 16, 1977.

He is easily recognisable by his black-framed \"Buddy Holly\" glasses, and, during live performances, often acts as the group's compère.\n\nAthol George Guy was born in Colac, Victoria, the son of George Francis Guy (RAN) and Doris Thelma (née Cole) Guy. Guy was educated at Gardenvale Central School, where he was school captain. He entered Melbourne High School, where he was twice under age athletic champion and an officer in the cadet corps. During this time he was Victorian Sub Junior High Jump Champion and then silver medallist to Olympian Colin Ridgway the next year. \n\nGuy formed his first musical group in 1958, The Ramblers, resulting in his move into performance, marketing and production at GTV9. Progressing via HSV7, media manager with the Clemenger Group and account exec with JWT, he then set sail with The Seekers for 10 weeks' holiday abroad. On his return he established his own consulting company and compèred two national TV shows.\n\nWhen The Seekers disbanded in 1968, Guy hosted his own variety series — \"A Guy Called Athol\" — on Australia's Seven Network, and later the quiz show \"Big Nine\" on the Nine Network. In 1971, he was elected as the Liberal member for Gisborne in the Victorian Legislative Assembly. One of its youngest members, he won three terms with an increasing majority before he returned to the commercial world as a corporate consultant. Guy has taken part in subsequent reunions of The Seekers since 1993, when the award-winning group celebrated the silver jubilee of its 1968 break up.\n\nGuy was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in a by-election on 11 December 1971 for Gisborne as a member of the Liberal Party. He served as a member of the assembly until resigning due to ill health on 5 March 1979. His achievements included the government's purchase and development of Werribee Park.\n\nGuy opted to return to the business world and rejoined the Clemenger group as General Manager of Clemenger Harvie from 1979 to 1989. During the 1990s Guy joined St George Bank's marketing team as Business Development Consultant, and then AMP's blue ribbon financial planning group, Hillross. With the assistance of the St George foundation Guy was instrumental in the Murdoch Institute introducing a genetic educational course into Victorian schools.\n\nAlongside these roles, he happily accommodated the many hundreds of reunion concerts with The Seekers from 1993 to about 2015, effectively curtailing any further political ambitions. In recent years, Guy has been involved in a joint venture with Hanging Rock Winery, launching \"Athol's Paddock\" in the Macedon Ranges. The first vintage from \"Athol's Paddock\" was 1997 and since that time has regularly produced award-winning Shiraz.\n\nHis multiple community roles have included:\n\n"}

{"id": "2198290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198290", "title": "Harold Camping", "text": "Harold Camping\n\nHarold Egbert Camping (July 19, 1921December 15, 2013) was an American Christian radio broadcaster, author and evangelist. Beginning in 1958, he served as president of Family Radio, a California-based radio station group that, at its peak, broadcast to more than 150 markets in the United States. In October 2011, he retired from active broadcasting following a stroke, but still maintained a role at Family Radio until his death. Camping is notorious for issuing a succession of failed predictions of dates for the End Times, which temporarily gained him a global following and millions of dollars of donations.\n\nCamping first predicted that the Judgment Day would occur on or about September 6, 1994. When it failed to occur, he revised the date to September 29 and then to October 2. In 2005, Camping predicted the Second Coming of Christ to May 21, 2011, whereupon the saved would be taken up to heaven in the rapture, and that \"there would follow five months of fire, brimstone and plagues on Earth, with millions of people dying each day, culminating on October 21, 2011, with the final destruction of the world.\"\n\nHis prediction for May 21, 2011 was widely reported, in part because of a large-scale publicity campaign by Family Radio, and it prompted ridicule from atheist organizations and rebuttals from Christian organizations. After May 21 passed without the predicted events, Camping said he believed that a \"spiritual\" judgment had occurred on that date, and that the physical Rapture would occur on October 21, 2011, simultaneously with the final destruction of the universe by God. Except for one press appearance on May 23, 2011, Camping largely avoided press interviews after May 21, particularly after he suffered a stroke in June 2011. After October 21, 2011 passed without the predicted apocalypse, the mainstream media labeled Camping a false prophet and commented that his ministry would collapse after the \"failed 'Doomsday' prediction\".\n\nCamping was reported to have retired from his position at Family Radio on October 16, 2011, only days before his final prediction for the end of the world. However, his daughter later clarified that he had not retired outright, but was maintaining a role at Family Radio while working from home. Camping admitted in a private interview that he no longer believed that anybody could know the time of the Rapture or the end of the world, in stark contrast to his previously staunch position on the subject. In March 2012, he stated that his attempt to predict a date was \"sinful\", and that his critics had been right in emphasizing the words of : \"of that day and hour knoweth no man\". He added that he was now searching the Bible \"even more fervently...not to find dates, but to be more faithful in [his] understanding.\" After the failure of Camping's prophecies, Family Radio suffered a significant loss of assets, staff and revenue.\n\nCamping died on December 15, 2013 after complications sustained from a fall in his home two weeks earlier.\n\nHarold Egbert Camping was born on July 19, 1921, in Boulder, Colorado and moved at an early age to California. Both his parents came from the Netherlands – his mother from Friesland, his father from Groningen – but they first met each other in the United States. In 1942, Camping earned a B.S. degree in civil engineering from the University of California, Berkeley. In 1943, he married his wife, Shirley. He and his family were members of the Christian Reformed Church until 1988.\n\nIn 1958, Camping joined with other individuals of Christian Reformed, Bible Baptist, and conservative Presbyterian backgrounds to purchase an FM radio station in San Francisco, California. The radio station – KEAR, then at 97.3 MHz – was used to broadcast traditional Christian Gospel to the conservative Protestant community and minister to the general public. Through the 1960s, Family Radio acquired six additional FM stations and seven AM stations under guidelines established by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\n\nIn 1961, Family Radio began running the Open Forum, a live, weeknight call-in program that Camping hosted until 2011. Listeners were invited to call in, primarily with questions about the meaning of certain passages from the Bible, and Camping answered them by means of interpretations, often with reference to other Biblical passages. Occasionally, questions were posed relating to general Christian doctrine, ranging from the nature of sin and salvation to matters involving everyday life, such as marriage, sexual morality and education. The Open Forum continued running until Camping's partial retirement in July 2011, and was broadcast on the more than 150 stations owned by Family Radio in the United States. The Open Forum was also translated into many foreign languages and (together with other Family Radio programming) was broadcast worldwide via shortwave station WYFR, a network of AM and FM radio stations, a cable television station and the Internet. In October 2012, over a year after the failure of Camping's prophecies, Family Radio began airing repeats of his broadcasts.\n\nFamily Radio runs various programs on its radio stations. Before Camping started teaching that the \"Church Age\" had ended, programs produced outside of Family Radio were welcome provided they did not accept any \"extra-Biblical revelation\", and were associated with teachings accepted by the historic Christian faith. Family Radio also utilized at least three television stations: WFME-TV in the New York City area; KFTL-CD in San Francisco, California; and KHFR-LD in Boise, Idaho. Following the digital transition of 2009, Family Radio used its subchannels of WFME and KFTL for various purposes – in WFME's case, the digital signal of that station broadcasts ten separate subchannels, the first being the main channel, and the others carrying audio feeds of other Family Radio services, as well as one broadcasting NOAA Weather Radio.\n\nFamily Radio spent over US$100 million on the information campaign for Camping's 2011 end times prediction, financed by sales and swaps of broadcast outlets.\n\nIn 1970, Camping published \"The Biblical Calendar of History\" (later greatly expanded in his 1974 book \"Adam When?\"), in which he dated the Creation of the world to the year 11,013 BC and the Flood to 4990 BC. This was in contradiction to Bishop James Ussher's famous 17th-century chronology, which placed the Creation at 4004 BC and the Flood at 2349 BC. Camping argued that Ussher's dates \"agree neither with the Biblical nor the secular evidence\", asserting that Ussher's methodology was flawed.\n\nCamping surmised that the word \"begat\" in the Old Testament scriptures did not necessarily imply an immediate father-son relationship, as had been assumed by Ussher and others who (Camping felt) had not correctly interpreted the biblical timeline. Camping noted the use of the phrase \"called his name\" (\"\"qara shem\"\" in Hebrew, found three times in Genesis 4–5), which he characterized as a \"clue phrase\" to indicate an immediate father-son relationship. Despite the fact that this \"clue phrase\" does not occur regarding Noah naming Shem, Camping maintained that there is enough evidence to otherwise conclude that they did, in fact, have an immediate father-son relationship. He also points out the use of \"qara shem\" in Isaiah 7:14, which he interpreted as meaning, \"Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.\"\n\nCamping assumed that, since \"qara shem\" implies an immediate father-son relationship (e.g., Adam–Seth, Seth–Enos, and Lamech–Noah), all other relationships between the Antediluvian patriarchs (except Noah–Shem) are of ancestors and their distant descendants. That is, when one patriarch died, the next one who is mentioned was not his son but was actually a distant multi-generational grandson who was born in that same year. Camping thus formulated the concept of the \"reference patriarch,\" i.e., various events are referenced to a specific year of a particular patriarch's life as a means of keeping an accurate chronological record. Although there is no evidence that any ancient civilization kept track of time in this way, Camping used this concept as the basis for his view of Biblical chronology.\n\nCamping taught that a Biblical calendar had been hidden according to Daniel 12:9 and Revelation 22:10, detailing the imminent end of the world (with alleged Biblical evidence pointing to the date for the Rapture as May 21, 2011); of the \"end of the church age\" (which asserts that churches are no longer the vehicle used by God for salvation, 1 Peter 4:17); and of predestination (Ephesians 1:4–5), according to which God determined before the beginning of the world which individuals are to be saved. In Camping's later publications, he stated that May 21, 2011 would be \"the first day of the Day of Judgment\" and October 21, 2011 would be the end of the world.\n\nCamping did not consider Family Radio a church and did not claim ordained or hierarchical authority within a church or institution. Camping claimed that the church institutions do not employ the Bible alone as the sole authority. According to Camping, each church or denomination has its own unique set of doctrines and hermeneutics, which dictate how they understand the Bible. Family Radio's sole focus on the Bible is what he believed distinguishes it from mainstream churches. In his book \"1994?\", he claimed there was a very high likelihood that the world would end in September 1994, although he did acknowledge in the book \"the possibility does exist that I could be wrong\"; Family Radio remained popular despite this failed prediction. Both before and after the failure of his 2011 prophecies, Camping received criticism from a number of leaders, scholars, and laymen within the Christian community, who argued that Jesus Christ taught that no man knows the day or the hour of the Lord's return. Camping responded to those who labelled him a \"date-setter\", following his own method of Biblical interpretation, by asserting that he followed the Bible's method of interpretation.\n\nCentral to Camping's teaching was his belief that the Bible alone is the word of God in its entirety, and thus is absolutely trustworthy. However, he emphasized, this does not mean that each sentence in the Bible is to be understood only literally. Rather, the meaning of individual Biblical passages also needs to be interpreted in the light of two factors. The first is the context of the Bible as a whole. The second is its spiritual meaning. In Camping's words, \"the Bible is an earthly story with a Heavenly meaning.\" This stems from Mark 4:34, which states that Jesus did not speak to the disciples without using parables. Because Christ is said to be the living Word of God, therefore, the historical accounts of the Old Testament can also be seen as parables. For example, in Camping's view, Joshua in the Book of Joshua (whose name in Hebrew is identical to the name \"Jesus\" in Greek) is a picture of Christ, who safely led the Israelites (who supposedly represented those who became saved) across the Jordan River (a representation of the wrath of God) into the land of Canaan (which represents the kingdom of God).\nAfter leaving the Christian Reformed Church in 1988, Camping taught doctrines that explicitly conflicted with the doctrines and confessions of the Christian Reformed Church and churches of the Reformed and Presbyterian traditions. Examples of Camping's teachings which varied from conventional Reformed doctrines include:\n\nCamping's teachings regarding the timing of Christ's second coming were based on the cycles of:\nHe projected these cycles into modern times and combined the results with other information in the Bible.\n\nCamping's date for the crucifixion of Christ – Friday, April 1, AD 33 (Gregorian) – is nominally the same day as one of those supported by other twentieth-century commentators: Friday, April 3, AD 33 (Julian). However, the dates differ because Camping used the Gregorian calendar, while most commentators use the older Julian calendar, which had a two-day difference during the 1st century AD (they now differ by thirteen days).\n\nIn 1992, Camping published a book titled \"1994?\", in which he proclaimed that Christ's return might be on September 6, 1994. In that publication, he also mentioned that 2011 could be the end of the world. Camping's predictions use 1988 as a significant year in the events preceding the apocalypse; this was also the year he left Alameda Bible Fellowship. As a result, some individuals criticized him for \"date-setting.\" Camping's later publications, \"We are Almost There!\" and \"To God be The Glory\", referred to additional Bible passages which, in his opinion, pointed to May 21, 2011, as the date for the Rapture and October 21, 2011, as the date for the end of the world.\n\nCamping gained notoriety owing to his incorrect prediction that the Rapture would take place on May 21, 2011, and that the end of the world would subsequently take place five months later on October 21, 2011. Followers of Camping claimed that around 200 million people (approximately 2.8% of the world's 2011 population) would be raptured, and publicized the prediction in numerous countries. It has also been reported that a 14-year old Russian girl named Nastya Zachinova committed suicide over his prediction.\n\nReuters reported on May 21 that the curtains were drawn in Camping's house in Alameda, California, and that no one was answering the door. Camping emerged from his home on May 22, saying he was \"flabbergasted\" that the Rapture had not occurred. He stated that he was \"looking for answers,\" and would say more when he returned to work on May 23.\n\nOn May 23, 2011, in an appearance before the press, Camping stated he had reinterpreted his prophecy. In his revised claim, May 21 was a \"spiritual\" judgment day, and the physical Rapture would occur on October 21, 2011, simultaneously with the destruction of the world. Camping said his company would not return money donated by followers to publicize the failed May 21 prediction, stating: \"We're not at the end. Why would we return it?\"\n\nAtheist and skeptic groups such as American Atheists and IIG gathered across the country with signs attracting attention away from Camping's followers who were in seclusion. Meanwhile, mainstream Christian groups distanced themselves from Camping's predictions.\n\nIn September 2011, Camping and several other prognosticators who incorrectly predicted various dates for the end of world were jointly awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for \"teaching the world to be careful when making mathematical assumptions and calculations\". In October 2011, News24 reported that the size of Camping's congregation had dwindled to \"about 25 adults on a typical Sunday\". Camping and his followers largely avoided the media in the months following May 2011, and he remained in seclusion after October 21, 2011 had passed without his predictions coming true. On October 21, \"Time\" magazine's website listed Camping's end times prediction as one of \"Time\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Top 10 Failed Predictions\".\n\nIn March 2012, Camping admitted that his predictions were in error, stating: \"We humbly acknowledge we were wrong about the timing.\" He also announced the \"End to Doomsday Predictions\". In May 2012, a year after the failure of Camping's prophecy, \"Religion Dispatches\" published a report on Camping's disillusioned former followers, some of whom had reportedly come to view him as a cult leader.\n\nIn October 2012, the \"Christian Post\" reported that Family Radio was re-broadcasting recordings of Camping's teachings. In March 2013, it was calculated that Family Stations Inc. spent more than $5 million on billboard advertising in 2011, the year the apocalypse was predicted to occur, and the network was reported to be suffering from a major loss of revenue, forcing it to sell its main radio stations and lay off staff.\n\nIn January 2014, a month after Camping's death, Family Radio stated that it would maintain his mission and theology, including the belief that all established Christian churches are apostate. For the next few years, Family Radio continued to air Camping's past broadcasts and distribute his literature. But in October 2018, Family Radio discontinued using any of his commentary and content because \"so much of it still contains elements that are very difficult.\" Tom Evans, who succeeded Camping as president and general manager of Family Radio, said \"Family Radio has come out of self-imposed isolation and we've repented from many of our former positions, date-setting the end of the world and all that, as well as the condemnation of the church.\" They are now using content from multiple evangelical sources, such as the young-earth creationist organization Answers in Genesis and Alistair Begg's \"Truth for Life\" program.\n\nOn June 9, 2011, Camping suffered a stroke and was hospitalized. In June, a neighbor stated his speech had become slurred as a result of the stroke, but on July 15, Family Radio stated Camping's speech was unaffected. After leaving the hospital, he moved to a nursing home for rehabilitation, before returning home to continue his recovery. Previously, on June 23, Family Radio had announced that it would replace Camping's \"Open Forum\" program with new programming.\n\nCamping died on December 15, 2013, as a result of complications from a fall at his home two weeks earlier. His death was confirmed by an employee of the Family Radio Network.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2198300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198300", "title": "Phosphaalkyne", "text": "Phosphaalkyne\n\nIn chemistry, a phosphaalkyne (IUPAC name: alkylidynephosphane) is an organophosphorus compound containing a triple bond between phosphorus and carbon with the general formula R-C≡P. Phosphaalkynes are the heavier congeners of nitriles, though, due to the similar electronegativities of phosphorus and carbon, possess reactivity patterns reminiscent of alkynes. Due to their high reactivity, phosphaalkynes are not found naturally on earth, but the simplest phosphaalkyne, phosphaethyne (H-C≡P) has been observed in the interstellar medium.\n\nThe first of preparation of a phosphaalkyne was achieved in 1961 when Thurman Gier produced phosphaethyne by passing phosphine gas at low pressure over an electric arc produced between two carbon electrodes. Condensation of the gaseous products in a –196 °C (–321 °F) trap revealed that the reaction had produced acetylene, ethylene, phosphaethyne, which was identified by infrared spectroscopy.\n\nFollowing the initial synthesis of phosphaethyne, it was realized that the same compound can be prepared more expeditiously via the flash pyrolysis of methyldichlorophosphine (CHPCl), resulting in the loss of two equivalents of hydrogen chloride. This methodology has been utilized to synthesize numerous substituted phosphaalkynes, including the methyl, vinyl, chloride, and fluoride derivatives. Fluoromethylidynephosphane (F-C≡P) can also be prepared via the potassium hydroxide promoted dehydrofluorination of trifluoromethylphosphine (CFPH). It is speculated that these reactions generally proceed via an intermediate phosphaethylene with general structure RClC=PH. This hypothesis has found experimental support in the observation of FC=PH by P NMR spectroscopy during the synthesis of F-C≡P.\n\nThe high strength of silicon-halogen bonds can be leveraged toward the synthesis of phosphaalkynes. Heating \"bis\"-trimethylsilylated methyldichlorophosphines ((SiMe)CRPCl) under vacuum results in the expulsion of two equivalents of chlorotrimethylsilane and the ultimate formation of a new phosphaalkyne. This synthetic strategy has been applied in the synthesis of 2-phenylphosphaacetylene and 2-trimethylsilylphosphaacetylene. As in the case of synthetic routes reliant upon the elimination of a hydrogen halide, this route is suspected to involve an intermediate phosphaethylene species containing a C=P double bond, though such a species has not yet been observed.\n\nLike the preceding method, the most popular method for synthesizing phosphaalkynes is reliant upon the expulsion of products containing strong silicon-element bonds. Specifically, it is possible to synthesize phosphaalkynes via the elimination of hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) from certain silylated phosphaalkenes with the general structure RO(SiMe)C=PSiMe. These phosphaalkenes are formed rapidly following the synthesis of the appropriate acyl \"bis\"-trimethylsilylphosphine, which undergoes a rapid [1,3]-silyl shift to produce the relevant phosphaalkene. This synthetic strategy is particularly appealing because the precursors (an acyl chloride and \"tris\"-trimethylsilylphosphine or \"bis\"-trimethylsilylphosphide) are either readily available or simple to synthesize.\n\nThis method has been utilized to produce a variety of kinetically stable phosphaalkynes, including aryl, tertiary alkyl, secondary alkyl, and even primary alkyl phosphaalkynes in good yields.\n\nDihalophospaalkenes of the general form R-P=CX, where X is Cl, Br, or I undergo lithium-halogen exchange with organolithium reagents to yield intermediates of the form R-P=CXLi. These species then eject the corresponding lithium halide salt, LiX, to putatively give a phospha-isonitrile, which can rearrange, much in the same way as an isonitrile, to yield the corresponding phosphaalkyne. This rearrangement has been evaluated using the tools of computational chemistry, which has shown that this isomerization process should proceed very rapidly, in line with current experimental evidence showing that phosphaisonitriles are unobservable intermediates, even at –85 °C (–121 °C).\n\nIt has been demonstrated by Cummins and coworkers that thermolysis of compounds of the general form CHPC(=PPh)R leads to the extrusion of CH (anthracene), triphenylphosphine, and the corresponding substituted phosphaacetylene: R-C≡P. Unlike the previous method, which derives the phosphaalkyne substituent from an acyl chloride, this method derives the substituent from a Wittig reagent.\nThe carbon-phosphorus triple bond in phosphaalkynes represents an exception to the so-called \"double bond rule\", which would suggest that phosphorus tends not to form multiple bonds to carbon, and the nature of bonding within phosphaalkynes has therefore attracted much interest from synthetic and theoretical chemists. For simple phosphaalkynes such as H-C≡P and Me-C≡P, the carbon-phosphorus bond length is known by microwave spectroscopy, and for certain more complex phosphaalkynes, these bond lengths are known from single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments. These bond lengths can be compared to the theoretical bond length for a carbon-phosphorus triple bond predicted by Pyykkö of 1.54 Å. By bond length metrics, most structurally characterized alkyl and aryl substituted phosphaalkynes contain triple bonds between carbon and phosphorus, as their bond lengths are either equal to or less than the theoretical bond distance. \n\nThe carbon-phosphorus bond order in phosphaalkynes has also been the subject of computational inquiry, where quantum chemical calculations have been utilized to determine the nature of bonding in these molecules from first principles. In this context, natural bond orbital (NBO) theory has provided valuable insight into the bonding within these molecules. Lucas and coworkers have investigated the electronic structure of various substituted phosphaalkynes, including the cyaphide anion (C≡P), using NBO, natural resonance theory (NRT), and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) in an attempt to better describe the bonding in these molecules. For the simplest systems, C≡P and H-C≡P, NBO analysis suggests that the only relevant resonance structure is that in which there is a triple bond between carbon and phosphorus. For more complex molecules, such as Me-C≡P and (Me)C-C≡P, the triple bonded resonance structure is still the most relevant, but accounts for only some of the overall electron density within the molecule (81.5% and 72.1%, respectively). This is due to interactions between the two carbon-phosphorus pi-bonds and the C-H or C-C sigma-bonds of the substituents, which can be visualized by inspecting the C-P pi-bonding molecular orbitals in these molecules.\n\nPhosphaalkynes possess diverse reactivity profiles, and can be utilized in the synthesis of various phosphorus-containing saturated of unsaturated heterocyclic compounds.\n\nOne of the most developed areas of phosphaalkyne chemistry is that of cycloadditions. Like other multiply bonded molecular fragments, phosphaalkynes undergo myriad reactions such as [1+2] cycloadditions, [3+2] cycloadditions, and [4+2] cycloadditions. This reactivity is summarized in graphical format below, which includes some examples of 1,2-addition reactivity (which is not a form of cycloaddition).\nThe pi-bonds of phosphaalkynes are weaker than most carbon-phosphorus sigma bonds, rendering phosphaalkynes reactive with respect to the formation of oligomeric species containing more sigma bonds. These oligomerization reactions are be triggered thermally, or can be catalyzed by transition or main group metals.\nPhosphaalkynes with small substituents (H, F, Me, Ph, ect.) undergo decomposition at or below room temperature by way of polymerization/oligimerization to yield mixtures of products which are challenging to characterize. The same is largely true of kinetically stable phosphaalkynes, which undergo oligimerization reactions at elevated temperature. In spite of the challenges associated with isolating and identifying the products of these oligimerizations, however, cuboidal tetramers of \"tert\"-butylphosphaalkyne and \"tert\"-pentylphosphaalkyne have been isolated (albeit in low yield) and identified following heating of the respective phosphaalkyne.\n\nComputational chemistry has proved a valuable tool for studying these synthetically complex reactions, and it has been shown that while the formation of phosphaalkyne dimers is thermodynamically favorable, the formation of trimers, tetramers, and higher order oligomeric species tends to be more favorable, accounting for the generation of intractable mixtures upon inducing oligomerization of phosphaalkynes experimentally.\n\nUnlike thermally initiated phosphaalkyne oligomerization reactions, transition metals and main group metals are capable of oligomerizing phosphaalkynes in a controlled manner, and have led to the isolation of phosphaalkyne dimers, trimers, tetramers, pentamers, and even hexamers. A nickel complex is capable of catalytically homocoupling Bu-C≡P to yield a diphosphatetrahedrane.\n"}

She is known for her films on gender issues in the North African (both Berbers and Arabs) immigrant community in France. Through her films, Benguigui gave a voice to many from the Maghrebi population in France.\n\nBenguigui's parents were Algerian and immigrated to France from Algeria in the early 1950s. She never discovered why her parents decided to leave Algeria, saying the subject was considered taboo. Born in Lille, Benguigui was the eldest daughter of six children and spent her childhood in northern France. Describing herself as a quiet child who grew up in the Islamic tradition, Benguigui was only 13 years old when she first decided to become a filmmaker.\n\nHer father was a political leader in the Algerian National Movement, and was jailed in France for three years as a political prisoner (she has also stated that he was jailed on two separate occasions, and that her whole family was once under house arrest). Because he did not support her in her chosen profession, Benguigui broke off contact with him early on, only to reconnect with him in late 2001. After she left the family her mother divorced her father as well. Yamina Benguigui married a Jewish pied-noir and has two daughters.\n\nEarning her baccalaureate and going on to study at film school, Benguigui then collaborated with French director Jean-Daniel Pollet. Later Benguigui founded \"Bandit Productions\" with director Rachid Bouchareb. While her work consisted of a feature film and short films, Benguigui's widely known for her documentaries which were mainly released in the 90's. She uses her films as a tool to build bridges between France's majority and minoritized groups, by bringing to light social issues such as challenges immigrants face. However, it is important to note, Benguigui did not represent all voices and through the film edits and framing of interviews, she ignored certain voices that did not benefit the message her films were sending.\n\nBenguigui released In 1994 her documentary \"Femmes d'Islam\" was broadcast on France 2, but subsequently she decided that she would prefer to examine the immigrant experience in France rather than life in Algeria.\n\nHer next documentary, \"Mémoires d'immigrés, l'héritage maghrébin\", cost 50 million francs and was the result of 350 interviews conducted with immigrants across France. After a two-year period of preparation and another nine months of editing it was first shown in May 1997 on Canal+. Receiving positive reviews from critics, it was rebroadcast the following month and brought to theaters the following January.\n\nIn 2001, Benguigui produced \"Inch’Allah dimanche,\" which takes a closer look at the role gender takes within the space of a home, specifically a young women, Zouina and her family. Previous films, made by men, depict Algerian women as secondary characters, and Benguigui uses her film as a platform where these women can be depicted as multifaceted and Zouina is able to negotiate her identity outside of the strict rules set by her husband.\n\nAs of February 2008 Benguigui was working on a film entitled \"Le paradis, c'est complet!\", starring Isabelle Adjani.\n\nIn the French municipal elections of March 2008 Benguigui was elected to represent the 20th arrondissement of Paris on the Paris city council, where she concerned herself in particular with human rights and the fight against discrimination. She is associated with the Socialist Party.\n\nOn 16 May 2012 President François Hollande of France appointed her to the post of Junior Minister for French Nationals Abroad and Relations with \"La Francophonie\" (French-speaking countries worldwide) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 21 June 2012 Yamina Benguigui was confirmed as Minister for la Francophonie in the French Government.\nOn 30 June 2012 the French President Francois Hollande asked Yamina Benguigui to succeed to Former French Prime Minister Jean Pierre Raffarin as his authorized representative for the OIF \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A port of the game for the PlayStation 2 was to be released by Acclaim Entertainment and ported by Acclaim Studios Teesside, but was eventually canceled.\n\nA top-secret government plan to utilize the dead for military purposes called U.D.S., Undead Soldier is thrown into darkness by some unknown entity. A year later, the city becomes ravaged by zombies. Three of the best AMS agents are sent in: Stick Breitling, Linda Rotta and Rikiya Busujima. They are sent out to eliminate the enemy and track down the mysterious leader of this attack, known only as \"Zed\". After battling through the city, they eventually confront Zed, who reveals that Stick's father was involved in project U.D.S. Zed wants revenge for his parents, who were murdered as part of the project. He despises all humans and wishes to turn them all into zombies by spreading the virus. Zed unleashes a powerful U.D.S. inside of him that he calls the God of Destruction, that he plans to use to destroy the rest of the humans, before the three agents defeat him and save humanity.\n\nPlayers battle zombies and bosses in each level through hand-to-hand combat, guns, or other weapons. Each player chooses one of the three characters with different attributes \nand various levels of proficiency in hand-to-hand combat and guns. The Dreamcast version of the game adds a Battle Mode in which two players can fight each other in one-on-one combat.\n\nAs a spin-off, the game contains various references to the original \"The House of the Dead\" game. Zombies sound and look the same as they did in the first game, and the main protagonists from both the original series and \"Revenge\" are AMS agents. At the start of the game, computer icons of Thomas Rogan and \"G\" can be seen on Linda's desktop. The Curien Mansion seen in the first House of the Dead appears as its own stage, called \"The House of the Dead\" and the music from the first stage is used. The final boss of \"Revenge\" is called Black Magician Type 01. The game's credits sequence are also similar, going back through the game's stages to the beginning of the game.\n\nChris Charla reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \"It looks great, it plays OK, but you'll be done with it forever in four hours. Find a video store and rent it.\"\n\nUpon release, the Dreamcast version received \"mixed\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 32 out of 40.\n"}

He was born in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and is of Burgher descent. In the Seekers, he played twelve string guitar (a 1967 Maton Special SS200/12), mandolin and banjo and sang. He has been the vocal, and often instrumental, arranger for the group throughout its career. Potger contributed the song \"All I Can Remember\" on the Seekers last 1960s studio album, \"Seekers Seen in Green\", as well as co-writing (under the pseudonym \"John Martin\") the single \"Emerald City\". On the Seekers' first 1990s studio album \"Future Road\", Potger wrote or co-wrote four songs; \"Guardian Angel/Guiding Light\", \"Circle Of Love\", \"Forever Isn't Long Enough (For Me)\" and \"Future Road\".\n\nPotger was also the co-founder, in 1969, of the contemporary pop group the New Seekers with his business partner David Joseph. His solo CDs are \"Secrets of the Heart\" (2004) \"Sunday\" (2007) and \"Smile Now\" (2010). Six songs on \"Sunday\" were a collaboration with writer and poet Frank Howson.\n\nHe appeared as a guest panelist on \"Spicks and Specks\" on 12 September 2007.\n\nMuch of the recent past has been taken up with performing concert tours with the Seekers in Australia and the United Kingdom. In addition, Potger has performed solo concerts throughout Australia and the UK and continues this activity with bookings into 2019.\n\nHe is a self-taught musician, playing the banjo, 6- and 12-string guitars and keyboards. While still at school, he performed in vocal groups which evolved into The Seekers in early 1962. This lineup of The Seekers comprised Athol Guy, Bruce Woodley, Ken Ray and Potger.\n\nLater that year, when Ken Ray left the group, Judith Durham joined Guy, Woodley and Potger, and they focused on the folk and gospel music boom, accompanying themselves on guitars, banjo and double bass. Potger's ability to arrange harmonies for the group members was evident from these early days.\n\nHe contributed the 12-string guitar riffs to The Seekers’ chart topping recordings, augmenting the lead voice of Judith Durham and the group's harmonies and instrumental talents.\n\nWhen the Seekers disbanded in 1968, Potger's musical activities turned to songwriting and record production in major recording studios in the UK. He collaborated with leading UK songwriters, such as Tony Macaulay and Barry Mason, and enjoyed chart success through the 1970s with British and American artists.\n\nReturning to Australia in 1978, Potger wrote and produced television jingles and music tracks as well as performing solo concerts throughout the 1980s. In 1988, he wrote and produced stage musicals for the Australian Bicentenary.\n\nIn 1992, Potger reunited with Judith Durham, Athol Guy and Bruce Woodley to tour internationally as the Seekers for their silver jubilee. In 1997, the group released the platinum-selling \"Future Road\", which included Potger's original song \"Guardian Angel, Guiding Light\", also co-writing \"The Circle of Love\" (with Rick Beresford), \"Forever Isn’t Long Enough (for Me)\" (with Byron Hill) and the title track \"Future Road\" (with Trevor Spencer and Boyd Wilson).\n\nThe Seekers toured extensively as a group from 1993 until about 2016. Potger has continued writing and recording original songs. He released his first solo album, \"Secrets of the Heart\", in 2004, followed by \"Sunday\" in 2007, with major solo concerts and festivals around Australia. In 2010, Potger released his mostly self-penned third solo album, \"Smile Now\".\n\nPotger frequently performs at charity concerts within his touring schedule. He was patron of the renowned children's charity Variety WA from 2001 to 2009. Potger was chair of Support Act Limited Victoria, the music industry benevolent fund with which he is still closely associated, being elected to the board of directors, a position he currently retains.\n\nPotger is a patron of the Motor Neurone Disease Association of Western Australia and a celebrity ambassador for Variety Victoria and Variety International.\n\nIn September 2014, along with Judith Durham, Athol Guy and Bruce Woodley, his colleagues in the Seekers, Potger was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO).\n\nIn November 2018, Potger coined the word \"mynonym\" to be a synonym for the word palindrome.\n\n"}

The cells are usually arranged in such a way that the entire kite is also a regular tetrahedron. The kite can be described as a compound dihedral kite as well.\nThis kite was invented by Alexander Graham Bell. It came about from his experiments with Hargrave's box kites and his attempts to build a kite that was scalable and big enough to carry both a man and a motor. As such, it was an early experiment on the road to manned flight. He worked on the kites between 1895 and 1910. Bell wrote about his discovery of this concept in the June 1903 issue of \"National Geographic\" magazine; the article was titled \"Tetrahedral Principle in Kite Structure\".\n\nFrom an initial one-cell model, Bell advanced to a 3,393-cell \"Cygnet\" model in 1907. This 40-foot-long (12.2 m), 200-pound (91 kilogram) kite was towed by a steamer offshore near Baddeck, Nova Scotia, on December 6, 1907, and carried a man 168 feet (51.2 metres) above the water.\n\nBell also experimented with a large circular \"tetrahedral truss\" design during the same period.\n\nThe tetrahedral kite is stable and easy to fly, but is not a light-wind kite. The large number of structural spars makes it relatively heavy and it requires moderate to strong winds.\n\n\n"}

His father Charles Whitney Gilkey was a liberal theologian and the first Dean of the University of Chicago's Rockefeller Chapel; his mother was Geraldine Gunsaulus Brown who was a well known feminist and leader of the YWCA.\n\nGilkey attended elementary school at the University of Chicago Laboratory School, and in 1936 graduated from the Asheville School for Boys in North Carolina. In 1940, he earned a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy, \"magna cum laude\", from Harvard University, where he lived in Grays Hall during his freshman year. The following year, he went to China to teach English at Yenching University and was subsequently (1943) imprisoned by the Japanese, first under house arrest at the University and later in an internment camp near the city of Weihsien in Shantung Province (where Eric Liddell was a fellow internee).\n\nAfter the War, Gilkey obtained his doctorate in Religion from Columbia University in New York, being both mentored by and a teaching assistant to Reinhold Niebuhr. He was a Fulbright scholar at Cambridge University (1950–51), and went on to become a professor at Vassar College from 1951 to 1954, and then at Vanderbilt Divinity School from 1954 to 1963. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1960 to study in Munich; another Guggenheim in the mid-1970s took him to Rome. In late 1963 he became a professor at the University of Chicago Divinity School, eventually being named Shailer Mathews Professor of Theology, until his retirement in March 1989. While on sabbatical in 1970, he taught at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands; in 1975 he taught at Kyoto University in Japan, his lecture series there focusing on the environmental perils of industrialization. After his retirement he continued to lecture until 2001 at both the University of Virginia and Georgetown University. During this last period of his teaching career, he was also for one year a visiting professor at the Theology Division (now Divinity School) of Chung Chi College, the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\nHe died of meningitis on November 19, 2004 at the University of Virginia hospital in Charlottesville. He was 85.\n\nGilkey was a prolific author, with 15 books and over 100 articles to his credit.\nPerhaps his most widely read book was the story of his own religious-theological journey. In \"Shantung Compound: The Story of Men and Women Under Pressure\" (1966), Gilkey narrates his departure from the liberal Protestant belief system during World War II when he was made a prisoner of war in the \"Civilian Internment Center\" near Weihsien for two-and-a-half years (1943–1945).\n\nThis experience was the basis for his modern interpretation of classical Reformation insights about individual and societal estrangement and self-delusion. Gilkey's new theology of history rethought Christianity and traditional views on sin, free will, providence, grace, eschatology and secular history.\n\nGilkey once responded to fellow theologian Edgar Brightman, who believed in God because man's history (to him) represented steady moral progress, saying \"I believe in God, because to me, history precisely does not represent such a progress.\"\n\nGilkey was respected academically for his work on Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich, but was popularly known for his writings on science and religion. He argued against both Christian fundamentalist attacks on science and secularist attacks on religion. He was an expert witness for the American Civil Liberties Union in the 1981 McLean v. Arkansas lawsuit against an Arkansas State law mandating the teaching of creation sciences in high schools.\n\nHis early books and articles demonstrated the existential power of his experiences, from his early pacifist professions as a student at Harvard University, where his classmates included, among others, future President John F. Kennedy, Pete Seeger, and Cardinal Avery Dulles, to his teaching in China and his experiences as a POW.\n\nHis teachers, especially Niebuhr and Tillich, at Union Theological Seminary, helped him with methods and categories to formulate a powerful and creative theological vision of his own. In the 1970s and 1980s, Gilkey's theological vision was colored by the growth of Buddhism, and Sikhism as both religions began to influence religious life in America. He held the view most world religions enjoyed \"rough parity\". \"The question for our age,\" he once wrote, \"may well become, not will religion survive, as much as will we survive and with what sort of religion, a creative or demonic one?\"\n\n\n\n"}

The opening theme to the finale is borrowed from the finale to keyboard concerto by Johann Christian Bach whom Mozart had met the previous year in London. The same theme would also appear in a much later, more mature work of Mozart's: the Act 2 Finale of his 1786 \"opera buffa\", \"Le nozze di Figaro\", K. 492.\n"}

The name also refers to the area on or adjacent to the hill. It is surrounded by Ngau Chi Wan, San Po Kong, Wong Tai Sin and Tsz Wan Shan. Its northeast is limited by the ridge. It is principally a residential district.\n\nThe village settlements in the area, Sheung Yuen Leng (上元嶺) and Ha Yuen Leng (下元嶺), predated British colonization, and may have been established as early as the early eighteenth century.\n\nThere were squatter dwellings (shanties) up and down the hill that were demolished after years of effort by the Hong Kong Government. The squatter population peaked at around 50,000 people. Parts of the squatter settlement were demolished over the years, including for expansion of the Kai Tak Airport during the Japanese occupation, construction of the Mass Transit Railway, Lung Cheung Road, and the Tate's Cairn Tunnel. Due to the dramatic shortage of public housing available for resettlement, the final sections were only demolished in 2001.\n\nContrary to its name, the area does not contain any diamond deposits. There are a number of theories as to why the misnomer came about, but the most accepted version states that the English name for this area was a simple mistranslation, for in Cantonese, the word \"鑽石\" can mean either \"diamonds\" or \"to drill for rocks\". In this case, the area was known as a stone quarry for many years before urban development took place. Due to that, the English name only became a euphemism. There are other theories as to why the area became known as \"Diamond Hill\", such as the crystals contained within the rocks mined from the area have a diamond-like luminance, or that the hill resembles the shape of a diamond.\n\nDiamond Hill Urn Cemetery is high in the hill. Diamond Hill MTR Station is located near Plaza Hollywood, a nearby shopping centre was so named to associate it with the former movie studio nearby, where many films were produced after World War II. It most notably launched the career of international star, Bruce Lee. Sam Hui and brothers lived around the area, too.

He played Lonnie, a banjo-playing teenager in north Georgia, who played the noted \"Dueling Banjos\" with Drew Ballinger (Ronny Cox). The film was critically acclaimed and received nominations for awards in several categories.\n\nRedden was born in Rabun County, Georgia on October 13, 1956.\n\nAt the age of fifteen, he was discovered by Lynn Stalmaster, who was scouting for the movie \"Deliverance\". Stalmaster recommended Redden to the director John Boorman, though Redden was not an albino child as Boorman had requested, and Redden was cast.\n\nHe portrayed a banjo-playing \"local\" during the film's famous \"dueling banjos\" scene. Boorman felt that Redden's skinny frame, large head, and almond-shaped eyes made him the natural choice to play the part of an \"inbred from the back woods.\" Because Redden could not play a banjo, he wore a special shirt which allowed a real banjo player to hide behind him for the scene, which was shot with carefully chosen camera angles that would conceal the player, whose arms were slipped around Redden's waist to play the tune. Interestingly, the hidden banjo player was shown playing \"clawhammer\" style, while the soundtrack had the banjo music as three finger \"Earl Scruggs\" style.\n\nAfter \"Deliverance\", Redden was cast in Lamberto Bava's 1984 film \"Blastfighter\". The film was recorded in and around Clayton, Georgia and many people recall it as a mixture of \"Deliverance\" and \"First Blood\".\n\nRedden next appeared in Tim Burton's 2003 film \"Big Fish\". Burton was intent on getting Redden, as he wanted him to play the role of a banjo-playing \"welcomer\" in the utopian town of Spectre. Burton located Redden in Clayton, where he was part-owner of the Cookie Jar Café, and also worked as a cook and dishwasher.\n\nIn 2004, Redden made a guest appearance on \"Blue Collar TV,\" playing a car repairman named Ray in a \"Redneck Dictionary\" skit. He represented the word \"raisin bread\" (as in \"Ray's inbred\"). He played a banjo in the skit.\n\nIn 2009, Redden played again his usual role (The banjo man) in 's film \"Outrage: Born in Terror\".\n\nIn 2012, 40 years after the release of \"Deliverance\", Redden was interviewed in association with a documentary, \"The Deliverance of Rabun County\" (2012). It explored the feelings of people in Rabun County four decades later about the 1972 film. Redden said that though \"Deliverance\" was the best thing that happened to him, he never saw much money from the movie:\n\nNoting some locals objected to the stereotypes in the movie, Redden said that the people in Rabun County were good people:\n\n\n"}

It was recorded after his girlfriend Jerry Hall left him for Mick Jagger in 1977, and appears to contain references to their break-up. The album peaked at number 13 on the albums chart in the United Kingdom. Although critically acclaimed, the album didn't achieve the success it was expected as it was released in the peak of punk rock.\n\nThe album's title is taken from the Marcel Duchamp artwork \"The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even\". Ferry had been introduced to the work as an art school student by Richard Hamilton. A subtext of Duchamp's piece is masculine and feminine relationships.\n\nReviewing for AllMusic critic, Ned Raggett wrote of the album \"When Jerry Hall, front-cover model on Roxy's \"Siren\", left Ferry for Mick Jagger, his response was this interesting album, not a full success but by no means a washout.\" And the critic, Robert Christgau wrote of the album \"Maybe the smoke in Bryan's eyes has finally reached his heart; the apparent sincerity of some of the singing here makes those five-minute moments when he lingers ponderously over a key lyric easier to take.\" and he added that \"The Los Angeles musicians don't hurt either – the conjunction of his style of stylization (feigned detachment) makes for interesting expressive tension.\"\n\nGreil Marcus listed it as his number one record in The Pazz and Jop Critics Poll of 1978. Marcus commented about the album, and is quoted saying, \"Already a certified commercial stiff after only a couple of months in the racks, this stunningly personal album—comparable in its way to Van Morrison’s \"Astral Weeks\", Jesse Winchester, John Cale’s \"Vintage Violence\" or Bob Dylan’s \"Blood on the Tracks\"—continues to deepen the Don-Juan-in-Hell persona this English eccentric has explored throughout the decade. Backed by American session men (notably guitarist Waddy Wachtel), Ferry acts out The Revenge of Lust, a tale that leaves all parties free to indulge their cruelest, most self-pitying instincts, and then pay for them. From “Can’t Let Go,” an extraordinarily dramatic account of a lover in exile, to “Hold On I’m Coming,” the latest in Ferry’s string of unlikely and successful covers, the record is glamorous, bitter, effete and passionate. As always, Ferry sings in the voice of Dracula risen from the grave—risen to tell us how much he cares.\n\nDave Marsh gave the record three stars (out of five) and wrote \"\"The Bride Stripped Bare\" balances Ferry's approaches much more effectively, allowing him to cover such romantic soul standards as \"That's How Strong My Love Is\" alongside his despondently modern \"When She Walks in the Room.\" The result might have been a triumph if it weren't for the misconceived production, largely the product of this quintessentially British singer working with such Los Angeles session musicians as Rick Marotta and Waddy Wachtel, who also coproduced. (Ferry's lack of commercial success in America was probably the reason for the inappropriate matchup.) Still, \"Bride\" suggests that Ferry's solo work still has much-underdeveloped potential; it's unfortunate that he has devoted all his time since then to the re-formed version of Roxy Music.\"\n\nMark Coleman in his three and half star review stated \"\"The Bride Stripped Bare\" is more adventurous; many listeners thought it was foolhardy. Bryan Ferry recording in L.A. with session veterans? Well, guitarist Waddy Wachtel pulls out some surprisingly ripe riffs, while Ferry croons both Al Green's \"Take Me to the River\" and the Velvet Underground's \"What Goes On\" without showing signs of strains. Recent Roxy Music converts might begin their Ferry appreciation course with this undervalued and very accessible item.\"\n\nRob Sheffield in another three and half star review wrote \"\"The Bride Stripped Bare\" was a real puzzle, slicking over some potentially great songs with a hack L.A. studio band (Waddy Wachtel on a Bryan Ferry record?). There's the glorious seven-minute \"When She Walks in the Room\" and a great version of the Irish folk song \"Carrickfergus,\" but Ferry's \"Take Me to the River\" has about one-eighth of the Big Muddy juice of Al Green's original, and it had the misfortune to come out the same year as Talking Heads' version.\"\n\n\nTechnical\n"}

Conlon (born 1965) is an author and former New York Police Department (NYPD) officer.\n\nBorn in the Bronx, Conlon spent most of his childhood in nearby Yonkers, and attended Regis High School. He graduated from Harvard in 1987 before joining the force in 1995. Conlon's police experience focused on patrolling city-owned public housing developments, as well as arresting street-level drug dealers after observing their sales from surveillance posts. In 2002, he was promoted to the rank of detective, and was assigned to the Bronx's 44th Precinct. He retired as a Detective, Second Grade, in 2011 after 16 years with the department.\n\nHe is currently working with the NYPD communications office.\n\nAfter college Conlon wrote a novel which remains unsubmitted and unpublished. His first published article for \"The New Yorker\" was \"To the Potter's Field\" (1993), a bleak piece about Hart Island, New York. After joining the NYPD, Conlon wrote the \"Cop's Diary\" column for \"The New Yorker\" from 1997 to 2000 under the pen name Marcus Laffey. In the Sept 12. 2011 issue of the New Yorker, Conlon wrote a piece in the Talk of the Town section titled \"Paying Attention\" about 9/11 and his final days with the NYPD detective unit. He plans to continue writing.\n\nThe column resulted in a nearly $1 million advance for \"Blue Blood\" (2004), which covers Conlon's years in the NYPD, his work conducting street-level narcotics enforcement in the Housing Bureau, his family's law enforcement background, and various anecdotes about the history of policing. The book received a favorable review on the cover of \"The New York Times Book Review\", debuted at #9 on the \"Times\" Best Seller list, and remained on the list for two weeks. Conlon appeared as a guest on National Public Radio's talk show \"Fresh Air\". The book was the basis of a 2007 television pilot that NBC commissioned but ultimately did not order.\n\nConlon turned to fiction with this novel of police life that strays from actual NYPD investigative practice. Nick Meehan, a New York City detective slipping into mid-career burnout, is assigned a special case for Internal Affairs to investigate a suspected dirty cop. Meehan and his new detective partner, Esposito, look into a variety of other cases, including the apparent suicide of a recently arrived Mexican immigrant woman, gangland slayings by rival drug dealers (called \"red on red\" or criminal on criminal killings), and a serial rapist. In between writing about crime, Conlon's book examines the personal lives of his two main characters, the alliances and loyalties, the emotional tolls, the temptations, the shades of gray inherent to police work. The pace may be slower than the average thriller, but this novel was targeted to appeal to readers of literary crime writers such as George Pelecanos, Dennis Lehane, and Richard Price.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2198463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198463", "title": "History of the Republic of India", "text": "History of the Republic of India\n\nThe history of the Republic of India begins on 26 January 1950. The country became an independent nation within the British Commonwealth on 15 August 1947. Direct administration by the British, which began in 1858, effected a political and economic unification of the subcontinent. When British rule came to an end in 1947, the subcontinent was partitioned along religious lines into two separate countries—India, with a majority of Hindus, and Pakistan, with a majority of Muslims; the eastern portion of Pakistan later split off to form Bangladesh. Concurrently the Muslim-majority northwest and east of British India was separated into the Dominion of Pakistan, by the partition of India. The partition led to a population transfer of more than 10 million people between India and Pakistan and the death of about one million people. Indian National Congress leader Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Prime Minister of India, but the leader most associated with the independence struggle, Mahatma Gandhi, accepted no office. Constitution adopted in 1950 made India a democratic country what has been sustained since then. India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newly independent states.\n\nThe nation has faced religious violence, casteism, naxalism, terrorism and regional separatist insurgencies. India has unresolved territorial disputes with China which in 1962 escalated into the Sino-Indian War, and with Pakistan which resulted in wars in 1947, 1965, 1971 and 1999. India was neutral in the Cold War, and a leader in the Non-Aligned Movement. It had a brief era of alliance with former Soviet Union, when Pakistan was closely allied to the United States and People's Republic of China.\n\nIndia is a nuclear-weapon state, having conducted its first nuclear test in 1974, followed by another five tests in 1998. From the 1950s to the 1980s, India followed socialist-inspired policies. The economy was influenced by extensive regulation, protectionism and public ownership, leading to pervasive corruption and slow economic growth. Beginning in 1991, neoliberal economic reforms have transformed India into the third largest and one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. From being a relatively destitute country in its formative years, Indian Republic has emerged as a fast growing G20 major economy with high military spending, and is seeking a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council.\n\nIndia sometimes been referred as a great power and a potential superpower given its large and growing economy, military and population.\n\nIndependent India's first years were marked with turbulent events – a massive exchange of population with Pakistan, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 and the integration of over 500 princely states to form a united nation. Credit for the political integration of India is largely attributed to Vallabhbhai Patel (deputy Prime Minister of India at the time), who post-independence and before the death of Mahatma Gandhi teamed up with Jawaharlal Nehru and the Mahatma to ensure that the constitution of independent India would be secular.\nAn estimated 3.5 million Hindus and Sikhs living in West Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, Baluchistan, East Bengal and Sind migrated to India in fear of domination and suppression in Muslim Pakistan. Communal violence killed an estimated one million Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs, and gravely destabilised both dominions along their Punjab and Bengal boundaries, and the cities of Calcutta, Delhi and Lahore. The violence was stopped by early September owing to the co-operative efforts of both Indian and Pakistani leaders, and especially due to the efforts of Mohandas Gandhi, the leader of the Indian freedom struggle, who undertook a \"fast-unto-death\" in Calcutta and later in Delhi to calm people and emphasise peace despite the threat to his life. Both governments constructed large relief camps for incoming and leaving refugees, and the Indian Army was mobilised to provide humanitarian assistance on a massive scale.\n\nThe assassination of Mohandas Gandhi on 30 January 1948 was carried out by Nathuram Vinayak Godse, a nationalist, who held him responsible for partition and charged that Mohandas Gandhi was appeasing Muslims. More than one million people flooded the streets of Delhi to follow the procession to cremation grounds and pay their last respects.\n\nIn 1949, India recorded almost 1 million Hindu refugees into West Bengal and other states from East Pakistan, owing to communal violence, intimidation, and repression from Muslim authorities. The plight of the refugees outraged Hindus and Indian nationalists, and the refugee population drained the resources of Indian states, who were unable to absorb them. While not ruling out war, Prime Minister Nehru and Sardar Patel invited Liaquat Ali Khan for talks in Delhi. Although many Indians termed this appeasement, Nehru signed a pact with Liaquat Ali Khan that pledged both nations to the protection of minorities and creation of minority commissions. Although opposed to the principle, Patel decided to back this pact for the sake of peace, and played a critical role in garnering support from West Bengal and across India, and enforcing the provisions of the pact. Khan and Nehru also signed a trade agreement, and committed to resolving bilateral disputes through peaceful means. Steadily, hundreds of thousands of Hindus returned to East Pakistan, but the thaw in relations did not last long, primarily owing to the Kashmir dispute.\n\nBritish India consisted of 17 provinces and 562 princely states. The provinces were given to India or Pakistan, in some cases in particular — Punjab and Bengal — after being partitioned. The princes of the princely states, however, were given the right to either remain independent or join either dominion. Thus India's leaders were faced with the prospect of inheriting a fragmented nation with independent provinces and kingdoms dispersed across the mainland. Under the leadership of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the new Government of India employed political negotiations backed with the option (and, on several occasions, the use) of the military action to ensure the primacy of the central government and of the Constitution then being drafted. Sardar Patel and V. P. Menon convinced the rulers of princely states contiguous to India to accede to India. Many rights and privileges of the rulers of the princely states, especially their personal estates and privy purses, were guaranteed to convince them to accede. Some of them were made Rajpramukh (governor) and Uprajpramukh (deputy governor) of the merged states. Many small princely states were merged to form viable administrative states such as Saurashra, PEPSU, Vindhya Pradesh and Madhya Bharat. Some princely states such as Tripura and Manipur acceded later in 1949.\n\nThere were three states that proved more difficult to integrate than others:\n\nThe Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution of India, drafted by a committee headed by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, on 26 November 1949. India became a sovereign democratic republic after its constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950. Dr. Rajendra Prasad became the first President of India. The three words 'socialist', 'secular' and 'integrity' were added later with the 42nd Constitution Amendment 1976.\n\nThe Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948 was fought between India and Pakistan over the princely state of Kashmir and Jammu from 1947 to 1948. It was the first of four Indo-Pakistan Wars fought between the two newly independent nations. Pakistan precipitated the war a few weeks after independence by launching tribal \"lashkar\" (militia) from Waziristan, in an effort to secure Kashmir, the future of which hung in the balance. The inconclusive result of the war still affects the geopolitics of both countries.\n\nIndia held its first national elections under the Constitution in 1952, where a turnout of over 60% was recorded. The National Congress Party won an overwhelming majority, and Jawaharlal Nehru began a second term as Prime Minister. President Prasad was also elected to a second term by the electoral college of the first Parliament of India.\n\nPrime Minister Nehru led the Congress to major election victories in 1957 and 1962. The Parliament passed extensive reforms that increased the legal rights of women in Hindu society, and further legislated against caste discrimination and untouchability. Nehru advocated a strong initiative to enroll India's children to complete primary education, and thousands of schools, colleges and institutions of advanced learning, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology, were founded across the nation. Nehru advocated a socialist model for the economy of India — Five-Year Plans were shaped by the Soviet model based on centralised and integrated national economic programs — no taxation for Indian farmers, minimum wage and benefits for blue-collar workers, and the nationalisation of heavy industries such as steel, aviation, shipping, electricity, and mining. Village common lands were seized, and an extensive public works and industrialisation campaign resulted in the construction of major dams, irrigation canals, roads, thermal and hydroelectric power stations, and many more.\n\nPotti Sreeramulu's \"fast-unto-death\", and consequent death for the demand of an Andhra State in 1952 sparked a major re-shaping of the Indian Union. Nehru appointed the States Re-organisation Commission, upon whose recommendations the States Reorganisation Act was passed in 1956. Old states were dissolved and new states created on the lines of shared linguistic and ethnic demographics. The separation of Kerala and the Telugu-speaking regions of Madras State enabled the creation of an exclusively Tamil-speaking state of Tamil Nadu. On 1 May 1960, the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat were created out of the bilingual Bombay State, and on 1 November 1966, the larger Punjab state was divided into the smaller, Punjabi-speaking Punjab and Haryanvi-speaking Haryana states.\n\nOn 4 June 1959, shortly after the Nagpur session of the Indian National Congress, C. Rajagopalachari, along with Murari Vaidya of the newly established Forum of Free Enterprise (FFE) and Minoo Masani, a classical liberal and critic of socialist Nehru, announced the formation of the new Swatantra Party at a meeting in Madras. Conceived by disgruntled heads of former princely states such as the Raja of Ramgarh, the Maharaja of Kalahandi and the Maharajadhiraja of Darbhanga, the party was conservative in character. Later, N. G. Ranga, K. M. Munshi, Field Marshal K. M. Cariappa and the Maharaja of Patiala joined the effort. Rajagopalachari, Masani and Ranga also tried but failed to involve Jayaprakash Narayan in the initiative.\n\nIn his short essay \"Our Democracy\", Rajagopalachari explained the necessity for a right-wing alternative to the Congress by saying:\nsince... the Congress Party has swung to the Left, what is wanted is not an ultra or outer-Left [viz. the CPI or the Praja Socialist Party, PSP], but a strong and articulate Right.\nRajagopalachari also insisted that the opposition must:\noperate not privately and behind the closed doors of the party meeting, but openly and periodically through the electorate.\nHe outlined the goals of the Swatantra Party through twenty one \"fundamental principles\" in the foundation document. The party stood for equality and opposed government control over the private sector. Rajagopalachari sharply criticised the bureaucracy and coined the term \"licence-permit Raj\" to describe Nehru's elaborate system of permissions and licences required for an individual to set up a private enterprise. Rajagopalachari's personality became a rallying point for the party.\n\nRajagopalachari's efforts to build an anti-Congress front led to a patch up with his former adversary C. N. Annadurai of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Annadurai grew close to Rajagopalachari and sought an alliance with the Swatantra Party for the 1962 Madras legislative assembly elections. Although there were occasional electoral pacts between the Swatantra Party and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Rajagopalachari remained non-committal on a formal tie-up with the DMK due to its existing alliance with Communists whom he dreaded. The Swatantra Party contested 94 seats in the Madras state assembly elections and won six as well as won 18 parliamentary seats in the 1962 Lok Sabha elections.\n\nNehru's foreign policy was the inspiration of the Non-Aligned Movement, of which India was a co-founder. Nehru maintained friendly relations with both the United States and the Soviet Union, and encouraged the People's Republic of China to join the global community of nations. In 1956, when the Suez Canal Company was seized by the Egyptian government, an international conference voted 18–4 to take action against Egypt. India was one of the four backers of Egypt, along with Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and the USSR. India had opposed the partition of Palestine and the 1956 invasion of the Sinai by Israel, the United Kingdom and France, but did not oppose the Chinese direct control over Tibet, and the suppression of a pro-democracy movement in Hungary by the Soviet Union. Although Nehru disavowed nuclear ambitions for India, Canada and France aided India in the development of nuclear power stations for electricity. India also negotiated an agreement in 1960 with Pakistan on the just use of the waters of seven rivers shared by the countries. Nehru had visited Pakistan in 1953, but owing to political turmoil in Pakistan, no headway was made on the Kashmir dispute.\n\nIndia has fought a total of four wars/military conflicts with its rival nation Pakistan, two in this period. In the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, Pakistan captured one-third of Kashmir (which India claims as its territory), and India captured three-fifths (which Pakistan claims as its territory). In the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, India attacked Pakistan on all fronts by crossing the international border after attempts by Pakistani troops to infiltrate Indian-controlled Kashmir by crossing the de facto border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir.\n\nIn 1961, after continual petitions for a peaceful handover, India invaded and annexed the Portuguese colony of Goa on the west coast of India.\n\nIn 1962 China and India engaged in the brief Sino-Indian War over the border in the Himalayas. The war was a complete rout for the Indians and led to a refocusing on arms build-up and an improvement in relations with the United States. China withdrew from disputed territory in what is to China South Tibet, and to India part of the North-East Frontier Agency that it crossed during the war. Unrelated to that war, India disputes China's sovereignty over the smaller Aksai Chin territory that it controls on the western part of the Sino-Indian border.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru died on 27 May 1964, and Lal Bahadur Shastri succeeded him as Prime Minister. In 1965, India and Pakistan again went to war over Kashmir, but without any definitive outcome or alteration of the Kashmir boundary. The Tashkent Agreement was signed under the mediation of the Soviet government, but Shastri died on the night after the signing ceremony. A leadership election resulted in the elevation of Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter who had been serving as Minister for Information and Broadcasting, as the third Prime Minister. She defeated right-wing leader Morarji Desai. The Congress Party won a reduced majority in the 1967 elections owing to widespread disenchantment over rising prices of commodities, unemployment, economic stagnation, and food crisis. Indira Gandhi had started on a rocky note after agreeing to a devaluation of the rupee, which created much hardship for Indian businesses and consumers, and the import of wheat from the United States fell through due to political disputes.\n\nMorarji Desai entered Gandhi's government as Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, and with senior Congress politicians attempted to constrain Gandhi's authority. But following the counsel of her political advisor P. N. Haksar, Gandhi resuscitated her popular appeal by a major shift towards socialist policies. She successfully ended the Privy Purse guarantee for former Indian royalty, and waged a major offensive against party hierarchy over the nationalisation of India's banks. Although resisted by Desai and India's business community, the policy was popular with the masses. When Congress politicians attempted to oust Gandhi by suspending her Congress membership, Gandhi was empowered with a large exodus of Members of Parliament to her own Congress (R). The bastion of the Indian freedom struggle, the Indian National Congress, had split in 1969. Gandhi continued to govern with a slim majority.\n\nIn 1971, Indira Gandhi and her Congress (R) were returned to power with a massively increased majority. The nationalisation of banks was carried out, and many other socialist economic and industrial policies enacted. India intervened in the Bangladesh War of Independence, a civil war taking place in Pakistan's Bengali half, after millions of refugees had fled the persecution of the Pakistani army. The clash resulted in the independence of East Pakistan, which became known as Bangladesh, and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's elevation to immense popularity. Relations with the United States grew strained, and India signed a 20-year treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union – breaking explicitly for the first time from non-alignment. In 1974, India tested its first nuclear weapon in the desert of Rajasthan, near Pokhran.\n\nIn 1973, anti-royalist riots took place in the Kingdom of Sikkim. In 1975, the Prime Minister of Sikkim appealed to the Indian Parliament for Sikkim to become a state of India. In April of that year, the Indian Army took over the city of Gangtok and disarmed the Chogyal's palace guards. Thereafter, a referendum was held in which 97.5 percent of voters supported abolishing the monarchy, effectively approving union with India.\n\nIndia is said to have stationed 20,000–40,000 troops in a country of only 200,000 during the referendum. On 16 May 1975, Sikkim became the 22nd state of the Indian Union, and the monarchy was abolished. To enable the incorporation of the new state, the Indian Parliament amended the Indian Constitution. First, the 35th Amendment laid down a set of conditions that made Sikkim an \"Associate State\", a special designation not used by any other state. A month later, the 36th Amendment repealed the 35th Amendment, and made Sikkim a full state, adding its name to the First Schedule of the Constitution.\n\nIn the Northeast India, the state of Assam was divided into several states beginning in 1970 within the borders of what was then Assam. In 1963, the Naga Hills district became the 16th state of India under the name of Nagaland. Part of Tuensang was added to Nagaland. In 1970, in response to the demands of the Khasi, Jaintia and Garo people of the Meghalaya Plateau, the districts embracing the Khasi Hills, Jaintia Hills, and Garo Hills were formed into an autonomous state within Assam; in 1972 this became a separate state under the name of Meghalaya. In 1972, Arunachal Pradesh (the North East Frontier Agency) and Mizoram (from the Mizo Hills in the south) were separated from Assam as union territories; both became states in 1986.\n\nIndia's population passed the 500 million mark in the early 1970s, but its long-standing food crisis was resolved with greatly improved agricultural productivity due to the Green Revolution. The government sponsored modern agricultural implements, new varieties of generic seeds, and increased financial assistance to farmers that increased the yield of food crops such as wheat, rice and corn, as well as commercial crops like cotton, tea, tobacco and coffee. Increased agricultural productivity expanded across the states of the Indo-Gangetic Plain and the Punjab.\n\nUnder Operation Flood, the government encouraged the production of milk, which increased greatly, and improved rearing of livestock across India. This enabled India to become self-sufficient in feeding its own population, ending two decades of food imports.\n\nThe Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 was the third in four wars fought between the two nations. In this war, fought over the issue of self-rule in East Pakistan, India decisively defeated Pakistan, resulting in the creation of Bangladesh.\n\nEconomic and social problems, as well as allegations of corruption, caused increasing political unrest across India, culminating in the Bihar Movement. In 1974, the Allahabad High Court found Indira Gandhi guilty of misusing government machinery for election purposes. Opposition parties conducted nationwide strikes and protests demanding her immediate resignation. Various political parties united under Jaya Prakash Narayan to resist what he termed Gandhi's dictatorship. Leading strikes across India that paralysed its economy and administration, Narayan even called for the Army to oust Gandhi. In 1975, Gandhi advised President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed to declare a state of emergency under the constitution, which allowed the central government to assume sweeping powers to defend law and order in the nation. Explaining the breakdown of law and order and threat to national security as her primary reasons, Gandhi suspended many civil liberties and postponed elections at national and state levels. Non-Congress governments in Indian states were dismissed, and nearly 1,000 opposition political leaders and activists were imprisoned and a programme of compulsory birth control introduced. Strikes and public protests were outlawed in all forms.\n\nIndia's economy benefited from an end to paralysing strikes and political disorder. India announced a 20-point programme which enhanced agricultural and industrial production, increasing national growth, productivity, and job growth. But many organs of government and many Congress politicians were accused of corruption and authoritarian conduct. Police officers were accused of arresting and torturing innocent people. Indira's son and political advisor, Sanjay Gandhi, was accused of committing gross excesses – Sanjay was blamed for the Health Ministry carrying out forced vasectomies of men and sterilisation of women as a part of the initiative to control population growth, and for the demolition of slums in Delhi near the Turkmen Gate, which left thousands of people dead and many more displaced.\n\nIndira Gandhi's Congress Party called for general elections in 1977, only to suffer a humiliating electoral defeat at the hands of the Janata Party, an amalgamation of opposition parties. Morarji Desai became the first non-Congress Prime Minister of India. The Desai administration established tribunals to investigate Emergency-era abuses, and Indira and Sanjay Gandhi were arrested after a report from the Shah Commission.\n\nIn 1979, the coalition crumbled and Charan Singh formed an interim government. The Janata Party had become intensely unpopular due to its internecine warfare, and a perceived lack of leadership on solving India's serious economic and social problems.\n\nIndira Gandhi and her Congress Party splinter group, the Indian National Congress or simply \"Congress\", were swept back into power with a large majority in January 1980.\n\nBut the rise of an insurgency in Punjab would jeopardise India's security. In Assam, there were many incidents of communal violence between native villagers and refugees from Bangladesh, as well as settlers from other parts of India. When Indian forces, undertaking Operation Blue Star, raided the hideout of self-rule pressing Khalistan militants in the Golden Temple — Sikhs’ most holy shrine — in Amritsar, the inadvertent deaths of civilians and damage to the temple building inflamed tensions in the Sikh community across India. The Government used intensive police operations to crush militant operations, but it resulted in many claims of abuse of civil liberties. Northeast India was paralysed owing to the ULFA's clash with Government forces.\n\nOn 31 October 1984, the Prime Minister's own Sikh bodyguards assassinated her, and 1984 anti-Sikh riots erupted in Delhi and parts of Punjab, causing the deaths of thousands of Sikhs along with terrible pillage, arson, and rape. Senior members of the Congress Party have been implicated in stirring the violence against Sikhs. Government investigation has failed to date to discover the causes and punish the perpetrators, but public opinion blamed Congress leaders for directing attacks on Sikhs in Delhi.\n\nThe Congress party chose Rajiv Gandhi, Indira's older son, as the next Prime Minister. Rajiv had been elected to Parliament only in 1982, and at 40, was the youngest national political leader and Prime Minister ever. But his youth and inexperience were an asset in the eyes of citizens tired of the inefficacy and corruption of career politicians, and looking for newer policies and a fresh start to resolve the country's long-standing problems. The Parliament was dissolved, and Rajiv led the Congress party to its largest majority in history (over 415 seats out of 545 possible), reaping a sympathy vote over his mother's assassination.\n\nRajiv Gandhi initiated a series of reforms: the Licence Raj was loosened, and government restrictions on foreign currency, travel, foreign investment, and imports decreased considerably. This allowed private businesses to use resources and produce commercial goods without government bureaucracy interfering, and the influx of foreign investment increased India's national reserves. As Prime Minister, Rajiv broke from his mother's precedent to improve relations with the United States, which increased economic aid and scientific co-operation. Rajiv's encouragement of science and technology resulted in a major expansion of the telecommunications industry and India's space programme, and gave birth to the software industry and information technology sector.\nIn December 1984, gas leaked out at the Union Carbide pesticides plant in the central Indian city of Bhopal. Thousands were killed immediately, while many more subsequently died or were left disabled.\n\nIndia in 1987 brokered an agreement with the Government of Sri Lanka and agreed to deploy troops for peacekeeping operation in Sri Lanka's ethnic conflict led by the LTTE. Rajiv sent Indian troops to enforce the agreement and disarm the Tamil rebels, but the Indian Peace Keeping Force, as it was known, became entangled in outbreaks of violence, ultimately ending up fighting the Tamil rebels itself, and becoming a target of attack from Sri Lankan nationalists. V. P. Singh withdrew the IPKF in 1990, but thousands of Indian soldiers had died. Rajiv's departure from Socialist policies did not sit well with the masses, who did not benefit from the innovations. Unemployment was a serious problem, and India's burgeoning population added ever-increasing needs for diminishing resources.\n\nRajiv Gandhi's image as an honest politician (he was nicknamed \"Mr. Clean\" by the press) was shattered when the Bofors scandal broke, revealing that senior government officials had taken bribes over defence contracts by a Swedish guns producer.\n\nGeneral elections in 1989 gave Rajiv's Congress a plurality, a far cry from the majority which propelled him to power.\n\nPower came instead to his former finance and defence minister, VP Singh of Janata Dal. Singh had been moved from the Finance ministry to the Defence ministry after he unearthed some scandals which made the Congress leadership uncomfortable. Singh then unearthed the Bofors scandal, and was sacked from the party and office. Becoming a popular crusader for reform and clean government, Singh led the Janata Dal coalition to a majority. He was supported by BJP and the leftist parties from outside. Becoming Prime Minister, Singh made an important visit to the Golden Temple shrine, to heal the wounds of the past. He implemented the Mandal Commission report, to increase the quota in reservation for low-caste Hindus. His government fell after Singh, along with Bihar's Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav's government, had Advani arrested in Samastipur and stopped his Ram Rath Yatra, which was going to the Babri Masjid site in Ayodhya on 23 October 1990. Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew their support to Singh government, causing them to lose parliamentary vote of confidence on 7 November 1990. Chandra Shekhar split to form the Janata Dal (Socialist), supported by Rajiv's Congress. This new government also collapsed in a matter of months, when Congress withdrew its support.\n\nThe then-Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Farooq Abdullah (son of former Chief Minister Sheikh Abdullah) announced an alliance with the ruling Congress party for the elections of 1987. But, the elections were allegedly rigged in favour of him. This led to the rise of the armed extremist insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir composed, in part, of those who unfairly lost elections. India has constantly maintained the position of blaming Pakistan for supplying these groups with logistical support, arms, recruits and training.\n\nMilitants in Kashmir allegedly tortured and killed local Kashmiri Pandits, forcing them to leave Kashmir in large numbers. Around 90% of the Kashmiri Pandits left Kashmir during the 1990s, resulting in the ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Hindus; A phrase only ever used by Indian media.\n\nOn 21 May 1991, while former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi campaigned in Tamil Nadu on behalf of Congress (Indira), a Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) female suicide bomber assassinated him and many others by setting off the bomb in her belt by leaning forward while garlanding him. In the elections, Congress (Indira) won 244 parliamentary seats and put together a coalition, returning to power under the leadership of P.V. Narasimha Rao. This Congress-led government, which served a full five-year term, initiated a gradual process of economic liberalisation and reform, which has opened the Indian economy to global trade and investment. India's domestic politics also took new shape, as traditional alignments by caste, creed, and ethnicity gave way to a plethora of small, regionally-based political parties.\n\nBut India was rocked by communal violence (see Bombay riots) between Hindus and Muslims that killed over 10,000 people, following the Babri Mosque demolition by Hindu extremists in the course of the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute in Ayodhya in 1992. The final months of the Rao-led government in the spring of 1996 suffered the effects of several major political corruption scandals, which contributed to the worst electoral performance by the Congress Party in its history as the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party emerged as the largest single party.\n\nUnder the policies initiated by late Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao and his then-Finance Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, India's economy expanded rapidly. The economic reforms were a reaction to an impending balance of payment crisis. The Rao administration initiated the privatisation of large, inefficient, and loss-inducing government corporations. The UF government had attempted a progressive budget that encouraged reforms, but the 1997 Asian financial crisis and political instability created economic stagnation. The Vajpayee administration continued with privatisation, reduction of taxes, a sound fiscal policy aimed at reducing deficits and debts, and increased initiatives for public works. Cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune, and Ahmedabad have risen in prominence and economic importance, becoming centres of rising industries and destinations for foreign investment and firms. Strategies like forming Special Economic Zones – tax amenities, good communications infrastructure, low regulation – to encourage industries has paid off in many parts of the country.\n\nA rising generation of well-educated and skilled professionals in scientific sectors of the industry began propelling the Indian economy, as the information technology industry took hold across India with the proliferation of computers. The new technologies increased the efficiency of activity in almost every type of industry, which also benefitted from the availability of skilled labor. Foreign investment and outsourcing of jobs to India's labor markets further enhanced India's economic growth. A large middle class has arisen across India, which has increased the demand, and thus the production of a wide array of consumer goods. Unemployment is steadily declining, and poverty has fallen to approximately 22%. Gross Domestic Product growth increased to beyond 7%. While serious challenges remain, India is enjoying a period of economic expansion that has propelled it to the forefront of the world economy, and has correspondingly increased its influence in political and diplomatic terms.\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged from the May 1996 national elections as the single-largest party in the Lok Sabha but without enough strength to prove a majority on the floor of that Parliament. Under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the BJP coalition lasted in power 13 days. With all political parties wishing to avoid another round of elections, a 14-party coalition led by the Janata Dal emerged to form a government known as the United Front. A United Front government under former Chief Minister of Karnataka H.D. Deve Gowda lasted less than a year. The leader of the Congress Party withdrew support in March 1997. Inder Kumar Gujral replaced Deve Gowda as the consensus choice for Prime Minister of a 16-party United Front coalition.\n\nIn November 1997, the Congress Party again withdrew support for the United Front. New elections in February 1998 brought the BJP the largest number of seats in Parliament (182), but this fell far short of a majority. On 20 March 1998, the President inaugurated a BJP-led coalition government, with Vajpayee again serving as Prime Minister. On 11 and 13 May 1998, this government conducted a series of five underground nuclear weapons tests, known collectively as Pokhran-II — which caused Pakistan to conduct its own tests that same year. India's nuclear tests prompted President of the United States Bill Clinton and Japan to impose economic sanctions on India pursuant to the 1994 Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act and led to widespread international condemnation.\n\nIn the early months of 1999, Prime Minister Vajpayee made a historic bus trip to Pakistan and met with Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, signing the bilateral Lahore peace declaration.\n\nIn April 1999, the coalition government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fell apart, leading to fresh elections in September. In May and June 1999, India discovered an elaborate campaign of terrorist infiltration that resulted in the Kargil War in Kashmir, derailing a promising peace process that had begun only three months earlier when Prime Minister Vajpayee visited Pakistan, inaugurating the Delhi-Lahore bus service. Indian forces killed Pakistan-backed infiltrators and reclaimed important border posts in high-altitude warfare.\n\nSoaring on popularity earned following the successful conclusion of the Kargil conflict, the National Democratic Alliance – a new coalition led by the BJP – gained a majority to form a government with Vajpayee as Prime Minister in October 1999. The end of the millennium was devastating to India, as a cyclone hit Orissa, killing at least 10,000.\n\nIn 2000 May, India's population exceeded 1 billion. President of the United States Bill Clinton made a groundbreaking visit to India to improve ties between the two nations. In January, massive earthquakes hit Gujarat state, killing at least 30,000.\n\nPrime Minister Vajpayee met with Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf in the first summit between Pakistan and India in more than two years in the middle of 2001. But the meeting failed without a breakthrough or even a joint statement because of differences over Kashmir region.\n\nThree new states — Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand (originally Uttaranchal) — were formed in November 2000.\n\nThe National Democratic Alliance government's credibility was adversely affected by a number of political scandals (such as allegations that the Defence Minister George Fernandes took bribes) as well as reports of intelligence failures that led to the Kargil incursions going undetected, and the apparent failure of his talks with the Pakistani President. Following the 11 September attacks, the United States lifted sanctions which it had imposed against India and Pakistan in 1998. The move was seen as a reward for their support for the War on Terror. The tensions of an imminent war between India and Pakistan again rose by the heavy Indian firing on Pakistani military posts along the Line of Control and the subsequent deadly Indian Parliament attack and the 2001–02 India–Pakistan standoff.\n\nIn 2002, 59 Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya were killed in a train fire in Godhra, Gujarat. This sparked off the 2002 Gujarat violence, leading to the deaths of 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus and with 223 people reported missing.\nThroughout 2003, India's speedy economic progress, political stability, and a rejuvenated peace initiative with Pakistan increased the government's popularity. India and Pakistan agreed to resume direct air links and to allow overflights, and a groundbreaking meeting was held between the Indian government and moderate Kashmir separatists. The Golden Quadrilateral project aimed to link India's corners with a network of modern highways.\n\nIn January 2004 Prime Minister Vajpayee recommended early dissolution of the Lok Sabha and general elections. The Congress Party-led alliance won a surprise victory in elections held in May 2004. Manmohan Singh became the Prime Minister, after the Congress President Sonia Gandhi, the widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, declined to take the office, in order to defuse the controversy about whether her foreign birth should be considered a disqualification for the Prime Minister's post. The Congress formed a coalition called the United Progressive Alliance with Socialist and regional parties, and enjoyed the outside support of India's Communist parties. Manmohan Singh became the first Sikh and non-Hindu to hold India's most powerful office. Singh continued economic liberalisation, although the need for support from Indian Socialists and Communists forestalled further privatisation for some time.\n\nBy the end of 2004, India began to withdraw some of its troops from Kashmir. By the middle of the next year, the Srinagar–Muzaffarabad Bus service was inaugurated, the first in 60 years to operate between Indian-administered and Pakistani-administered Kashmirs. However, in May 2006, suspected Islamic extremist militants killed 35 Hindus in the worst attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir for several months.\n\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami devastated Indian coastlines and islands, killing an estimated 18,000 and displacing around 650,000. The tsunami was caused by a powerful undersea earthquake off the Indonesian coast. Natural disasters such as the Mumbai floods (killing more than 1,000) and Kashmir earthquake (killing 79,000) hit the subcontinent in the next year. In February 2006, the United Progressive Alliance government launched India's largest-ever rural jobs scheme, aimed at lifting around 60 million families out of poverty.\nThe United States and India signed a major nuclear co-operation agreement during a visit by United States President George W. Bush in March 2006. According to the nuclear deal, the United States was to give India access to civilian nuclear technology while India agreed to greater scrutiny for its nuclear programme. Later, United States approved a controversial law allowing India to buy their nuclear reactors and fuel for the first time in 30 years. In July 2008, the United Progressive Alliance survived a vote of confidence brought after left-wing parties withdrew their support over the nuclear deal. After the vote, several left-wing and regional parties formed a new alliance to oppose the government, saying it had been tainted by corruption. Within three months, following approval by the U.S. Congress, George W. Bush signed into law a nuclear deal with India, which ended a three-decade ban on American nuclear trade with Delhi.\n\nIn 2007, India got its first female President as Pratibha Patil was sworn in. Long associated with the Nehru–Gandhi family, Pratibha Patil was a low-profile governor of the state of Rajasthan before emerging as the favoured presidential candidate of Sonia Gandhi. In February, the infamous Samjhauta Express bombings took place, killing Pakistani civilians in Panipat, Haryana. As of 2011, nobody had been charged for the crime, though it has been linked to Abhinav Bharat, a shadowy Hindu fundamentalist group headed by a former Indian army officer.\n\nIn 2008 October, India successfully launched its first mission to the Moon, the unmanned lunar probe called \"Chandrayaan-1\". In the previous year, India had launched its first commercial space rocket, carrying an Italian satellite.\nIn November 2008, Mumbai attacks took place. India blamed militants from Pakistan for the attacks and announced a \"pause\" in the ongoing peace process.\n\nIn July 2009, the Delhi High Court decriminalised consensual homosexual sex, declaring the British Raj-era law, Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, as unconstitutional.\n\nIn the Indian general election in 2009, the United Progressive Alliance won a convincing and resounding 262 seats, with Congress alone winning 206 seats. However, the Congress-led government faced many allegations of corruption. Inflation rose to an all-time high, and the ever-increasing prices of food commodities caused widespread agitation.\nIn 8 November 2009, in spite of strong protests by China, which claims the whole of Arunachal Pradesh as its own, the 14th Dalai Lama visited Tawang Monastery in Arunachal Pradesh,\nwhich was a monumental event to the people of the region, and the abbot of the monastery greeted him with much fanfare and adulation.\n\n21st-century India is facing the Naxalite-Maoist rebels, in the words of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, India's \"greatest internal security challenge\", and other terrorist tensions (such as Islamist terrorist campaigns in and out of Jammu & Kashmir and terrorism in India's Northeast). Terrorism has increased in India, with bomb blasts in leading cities like Mumbai, New Delhi, Jaipur, Bangalore, and Hyderabad. In the new millennium, India improved relations with many countries and foreign unions including the United States, the European Union, Israel, and the People's Republic of China. The economy of India has grown at a very rapid pace. India was now being looked at as a potential superpower.\n\nThe concerns and controversies over the 2010 Commonwealth Games rocked the country in 2010, raising questions about the credibility of the government followed by the 2G spectrum case and Adarsh Housing Society scam. In mid-2011, Anna Hazare, a prominent social activist, staged a 12-day hunger strike in Delhi in protest at state corruption, after government proposals to tighten up anti-graft legislation fell short of his demands.\n\nDespite all this, India showed great promise with a higher growth rate in gross domestic product. In January 2011, India assumed a nonpermanent seat in the United Nations Security Council for the 2011–12 term. In 2004, India had launched an application for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, along with Brazil, Germany and Japan. In March, India overtook China to become the world's largest importer of arms.\n\nThe Telangana movement reached its peak in 2011–12, leading to formation of India's 29th state, Telangana, in June 2014.\n\nThe 2012 Delhi gang rape case and subsequent protest by civil society resulted in changes in the laws related to rape and offences against women. In April 2013, the Saradha Group financial scandal was unearthed, caused by the collapse of a Ponzi scheme run by Saradha Group, a consortium of over 200 private companies in Eastern India, causing an estimated loss of INR 200–300 billion (US$4–6 billion) to over 1.7 million depositors. In December 2013, the Supreme Court of India overturned the Delhi High Court ruling on Sec 377, criminalising homosexual sex between consenting adults once again in the country.\nIn August 2010, cloudbursts and the ensuing flooding in the Ladakh region of North India resulted in the deaths of around 255 people, while affecting 9,000 people directly. In June 2013, a multi-day cloudburst in Uttarakhand and other north Indian states caused devastating floods and landslides, with more than 5,700 people \"presumed dead.\" In September 2014, floods in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, following heavy rains due to monsoon season, killed around 277 people and brought extensive damage to property. A further 280 people died in the neighbouring Pakistani regions, particularly in Pakistani Punjab.\n\nIn August – September 2013, clashes between Hindus and Muslims in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, resulted in at least 62 deaths, injured 93, and left more than 50,000 displaced.\nIn November 2013, India launched its first interplanetary mission, the Mars Orbiter Mission, popularly known as \"Mangalyaan\", to Mars and, was successful, so ISRO on 24 September 2014, became the fourth space agency to reach Mars, after the Soviet space program, NASA, and the European Space Agency. ISRO also became the first space agency and India the first country to reach Mars on its maiden attempt.\n\nThe Hindutva movement advocating Hindu nationalism originated in the 1920s and has remained a strong political force in India. The major party of the religious right, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), since its foundation in 1980 won elections, and after a defeat in 2004 remained one of the leading forces against the coalition government of the Congress Party. The 16th national general election, held in early 2014, saw a dramatic victory of the BJP; it gained an absolute majority and formed a government under the premiership of Narendra Modi, a BJP leader and till then the Chief Minister of Gujarat. The Modi government's sweeping mandate and popularity helped the BJP win several State Assembly elections in India. The Modi government implemented several initiatives and campaigns to increase manufacturing and infrastructure — notably — Make in India, Digital India and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.\n\n\n\n"}

His first appearance was in \"The Avengers\" Vol.1 #19 (Aug. 1965) and was created by Stan Lee and Don Heck. Although he was first introduced as an enemy of Hawkeye and the Avengers, the character has since appeared as both a supervillain and a superhero.\n\nThe Swordsman first appeared as a supervillain in \"The Avengers\" Vol. 1 #19 (1965). He went on to appear in \"Avengers\" Vol. 1 #20, 30, 38, 65, 78 and 79 (1965–1970). The Swordsman changed his ways and became a superhero in \"Avengers\" Vol. 1 #100 (1972) and later became a member of the Avengers in \"Avengers\" Vol. 1 #112–130 (1973–1974), \"Defenders\" Vol. 1 #9–11 (1973), \"Captain Marvel\" Vol. 1 #32–33 (1974), \"Fantastic Four\" Vol. 1 #150 (1974), \"Giant-Size Avengers\" Vol. 1 #2 (1974) and \"Avengers Spotlight\" #22 (1989). Later, the Cotati-possessed Swordsman appeared in \"Avengers\" Vol. 1 #134, 135, 157, 160 (1975–1977), \"Giant-Size Avengers\" Vol. 1 #4 (1975) and \"West Coast Avengers\" Vol. 2 #39 (1988). \n\nThe Swordsman has been a member of various supervillain groups, including the Lethal Legion in \"Avengers\" Vol. 1 #78–79 (1970) and \"Iron Man Annual\" #7 (1984), the Emissaries of Evil in \"Alpha Flight Special\" Vol. 2 #1 (1992), and the Legion of the Unliving in \"Avengers Annual\" #16 (1987), \"Avengers West Coast\" Vol. 2 #61 (1990) and \"Avengers\" Vol. 3 #10–11 (1998). \n\nIntroduced as a villainous counterpart to Hawkeye in the pages of \"The Avengers\", the Swordsman went on to appear in \"Hawkeye\" Vol.1 #1 (1983), \"Solo Avengers\" #2 (1988), \"Hawkeye\" Vol.3 #3 (2004) and \"\" #1 (2011) as part of Hawkeye's origins. The Swordsman also battled Captain America in \"Tales of Suspense\" #88 (1967) and \"Captain America\" #105 (1968). \n\nThe 2010–2011 crossover storyline Chaos War saw the return of the Swordsman. He was one of the central characters in the tie-in series \"Chaos War: Dead Avengers\" (2010–2011). The Swordsman also featured in \"Chaos War\" #2 & 4–5 (2010–2011) and \"Chaos War: Ares\" #1 (2010).\n\nJacques Duquesne grew up as a privileged youth in the (fictional) Southeast Asian nation of Siancong, then under French rule. Unlike his father and other European residents, Duquesne held no prejudice against the Siancongese natives, and after performing an act of kindness for a native servant, he was invited to join a communist rebellion against French rule. As the costumed Swordsman, Duquesne, fancying himself a swashbuckling freedom fighter, helped liberate Siancong, only to learn the rebel leader Wong Chu had killed Duquesne's father. Devastated and disillusioned, Duquesne departed Siancong to seek adventure. Nothing else is known of Duquesne's early career, but he eventually joined the Carson Carnival of Traveling Wonders; although his swordplay made him one of the carnival's star attractions, he gradually descended into gambling and drunkenness, his youthful idealism long behind him.\n\nEventually Duquesne, by now in his thirties or older, took a young runaway named Clint Barton under his wing and taught him how to use bladed weapons, while another performer, Trick Shot, taught Barton archery, at which he proved to be a master. The young Clint stumbled upon Duquesne stealing money from the carnival's paymaster to pay a gambling debt. Clint attempted to turn his mentor over to the law, but he was pursued by Duquesne and badly beaten. Before Duquesne could deliver the fatal blow, Trick Shot stepped in to save the young boy. Duquesne then fled the carnival and adopted his swordsplay act to become a costumed supervillain.\n\nYears later, the Swordsman attempted to join the Avengers (whose members included Clint Barton, now known as the superhero Hawkeye) in order to take advantage of the benefits that go with an Avenger ID. He was refused entry into the team, largely due to Hawkeye's protests and the fact he was wanted in different states, and threatened to kill Captain America after capturing him, but the rest were able to rescue him. After failing the first time around, he was accepted into the Avengers. However, he was secretly an agent of the Mandarin, who had teleported him to his castle before the Avengers could capture him, and created a pseudo-image of Iron Man to recommend the Swordsman to the Avengers. The Mandarin also fitted the Swordsman's sword with extra powers, such as firing artificial lightning bolts, though he warned the Swordsman if they were ever pointed at him they would reverse. Soon after joining the Avengers, the Swordsman revealed his true intentions and betrayed the team, planting a bomb on the control panels which could be activated by remote-control. He soon had a change of heart and betrayed the Mandarin to save the Avengers. Despite his heroics, the Swordsman left the ranks of the Avengers, knowing the Mandarin would now be against him.\n\nThe Swordsman went back to being a supervillain for hire and battled the Avengers on numerous occasions. Under Black Widow's leadership, the Swordsman teamed with the original Power Man and fought the superhero team, capturing nearly all of its members. With Power Man, he fought against Captain America as agents of the Red Skull. The Swordsman also participated in the Mandarin's attempt at world conquest, along with other villains. He later battled Captain America again, as a member of Batroc's Brigade, was employed by Egghead where he battled Hawkeye (in his Goliath persona). Along with Power Man, the Swordsman joined the supervillain group the Lethal Legion and battled the Avengers.\n\nEventually, the Swordsman briefly rejoined the Avengers in a war against Ares in Olympus. Later, he met with Mantis, an ally of the Avengers, and then rejoined the Avengers after he secretly fell in love with her. He subsequently participated in the Avengers/Defenders war.\n\nIn his last mission, Duquesne aided the Avengers in the conflict that involved Kang's quest for the \"Celestial Madonna\". In order to facilitate his plans, Kang had captured the Avengers present at the time – Vision, Thor, Iron Man, Mantis, The Scarlet Witch, and their guest Agatha Harkness – but left Swordsman behind because he considered him useless. Humiliated but determined to show Kang his true worth, Swordsman tracked the captive Avengers to Kang's pyramid base in Gizeh, where he encountered Rama-Tut, Kang's chronological alter ego. With his help and the assistance of Hawkeye, who had just returned from a leave of absence, Swordsman managed to free his fellow Avengers. It was later revealed that Mantis was in fact the \"Celestial Madonna\". After Kang's plans were foiled and he decided not to leave the Madonna to anyone else, the Swordsman sacrificed his life by intercepting Kang's energy blast which was meant for Mantis. Mantis soon after married the eldest of Earth's alien Cotati, who had resurrected and possessed the Swordsman's corpse and infused a portion of its own consciousness into it. Mantis and Swordsman went on to have a son together. After battling the Avengers, the Cotati-possessed Swordsman crumbled to dust.\n\nDuring the \"Chaos War\" storyline, Swordsman is among the deceased heroes released by Pluto in order to defend the Underworld from Amatsu-Mikaboshi. Returning to Earth, the Swordsman joins a team of \"dead\" Avengers, led by Captain Mar-Vell, who take it upon themselves to protect their unconscious teammates from the Grim Reaper. After the battle only the Swordsman and the Rita DeMara Yellowjacket remained.\n\nThe Swordsman is an Olympic level athlete with no superhuman powers, and is a cunning strategist with phenomenal reflexes and highly adept at unarmed combat. The Swordsman is a master in the uses of bladed weapons, especially swords and knives, and his main weapon is a sword modified by the super-villain Mandarin from Makluan technology. By pressing one of the buttons on the sword's hilt, the Swordsman can project a concussive force beam, a disintegrating ray, a large jet of flame, electrical energy in a form resembling lightning, or a stream of nerve gas that induced temporary unconsciousness. He also carries various throwing knives and daggers as needed.\n\nPhilip Javert, a Swordsman from an alternate universe, was a member of the Gatherers. The Gatherers were brought together by Proctor (an alternate version of the Black Knight) to hunt down every Sersi throughout the multiverse. Proctor and the Gatherers travelled to the mainstream Marvel Universe (Earth-616) to kill its version of Sersi. The Swordsman, along with fellow Gatherers member Magdalene, turned against Proctor and briefly joined the mainstream version of the Avengers. Some years later, they would team with the Avengers and the Squadron Supreme and leave Earth-616 for parts unknown.\n\nA new heroine named Swordswoman later appears as a member of the European superhero team known as Euroforce. She is later revealed to be Marjorie, the Swordsman's illegitimate teenage daughter from Paris.\n\nA new Swordsman later appears, wielding a vibranium alloy katana and claiming to have inherited the mantle of Jacques Duquesne. He attempts to extort money from the town of Sauga River by threatening to flood it, but is defeated by Captain America.\n\nA zombified Swordsman is seen attacking and devouring Magneto. After Magneto's defeat, Swordsman otherwise made a cameo appearance. He then attempted, unsuccessfully, to slay the Ultimate Universe's Fantastic Four, ending with him temporarily blinded by Ultimate Invisible Woman. And he also attempted to slay the Silver Surfer, though that was unsuccessful, too; he was killed when he is literally torn apart by the Power Cosmic energy.\n\nA version of the Swordsman appears as a native of the \"Heroes Reborn\" world, which was created by Franklin Richards. He and his world were created after the Avengers \"died\" battling Onslaught. This version of Swordsman wielded Black Knight's Ebony Blade. When the Avengers encountered and fought against Kang and Mantis, Swordsman appeared to remember his previous life despite being a construct created by Franklin. This version later adopted the guise of Deadpool.\n\nIn the House of M reality, the Swordsman was a member of Shang-Chi's Dragons criminal organization, alongside Colleen Wing, Mantis, Zaran and Machete. He was killed by Bullseye when the Dragons are ambushed by the Kingpin's assassins.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since the highway contains the two separate communities of Harper and Leoville, but is entirely officially known as Harper Road, some locals avoid naming the Leoville portion of the highway as being on \"Harper Road\" because Leoville is seen as distinct from Harper (or Harper Road).

Punnett co-hosted \"Ian and Margery\" with his wife on KTMY in Minneapolis-St. Paul and was the regular Saturday night host of the widely syndicated paranormal-themed \"Coast to Coast AM\", created by Art Bell. On December 3, 2011, Punnett announced that due to increasingly acute tinnitus, he would temporarily step down as regular Saturday night host of \"Coast to Coast AM\", being replaced by John B. Wells: effective January 2012, Punnett would host the show one Sunday per month. In July 2013, Punnett ended his radio hosting career in order to begin studies for a doctoral degree. After receiving his Ph.D. in 2017, he returned as an occasional guest host of Coast to Coast AM in 2018 and became a faculty member at Kansas State University.\n\nPunnett graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he was a student columnist for the \"Daily Illini\". After college, under the pseudonym \"Ian Case\" (his first and middle names transposed), he co-hosted rock morning radio shows on WXLP in the Quad Cities called \"Ian Case and the Coach\" and then \"Ian Case and The Duke\" with Mike \"The Duke\" Donegan on then-rock music station WKDF in Nashville, Tennessee in the early-to-mid-1990s. In between his Quad Cities stints, Punnett was also morning man on WMJY in Long Branch, New Jersey.\n\nPunnett went on to talk radio at WGN in Chicago in 1994, then went to Atlanta, Georgia in 1997 to host a nightly talk show on WGST under his real name, Ian Punnett. He returned to the WKDF morning show in 1998, though he remained in Atlanta and broadcast the show from his home studio (while co-host Mike \"Duke\" Donegan broadcast from the station's Nashville studio). Punnett would occasionally slip up and announce his real name instead of the pseudonym, which inadvertently became a running gag. That show's run came to an end in early 1999, shortly before WKDF switched to a country music format.\n\nIn Minneapolis-St. Paul, Punnett hosted the morning show (6-10 am) on KTMY-FM. The show was known as \"Ian & Margery\", and was co-hosted by his wife, Margery (a former TV producer who has worked for CNN as well as for \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\") who did her part of the show from a studio in their home while getting their two teenage boys off to school. Punnett has a Master of Divinity degree from Columbia Theological Seminary in Atlanta, a PhD from the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University and has been ordained a Deacon in the Episcopal Church. Since 1998, Punnett has intermittently hosted \"Coast to Coast AM\".\n\nOn August 1, 2007, Punnett helped report the Minneapolis bridge collapse on CNN.\n\nIn 1998 Punnett began occasionally hosting \"Coast to Coast AM\". In April 2000, Punnett became the regular Sunday-night host for \"Coast to Coast\". He was the first person other than Art Bell to be \"given\" a night of the week in his or her name. In December, 2001, Punnett left \"Coast to Coast AM with Ian Punnett\" to do mornings in the Twin Cities for Hubbard Broadcasting and to concentrate on finishing seminary. His replacement for Sunday nights was George Noory who would eventually take over the entire show when Art Bell retired again a few years later. Although Punnett occasionally acted as a guest host, he did not rejoin \"Coast to Coast AM\" on a full-time basis until June 2005 when Art Bell, who had been doing the two weekend shifts again, announced that he wanted to host just one night a week in order to spend more time traveling with his wife, Ramona. \"Coast to Coast AM with Ian Punnett\" once again returned to the weekly line-up, this time on Saturdays.\n\nOn January 21, 2006, after the death of Ramona Bell, Punnett announced that Art Bell, the creator and original host of \"Coast to Coast AM\" would be returning from retirement to host each Saturday and Sunday night. Punnett then moved to \"Coast to Coast Live with Ian Punnett\", a new, four-hour program, on January 28, 2006. The new show occupied a slot (6 pm-10 pm PST/9 pm-1 am EST), the same period that previously broadcast repeats of older \"Coast to Coast AM\" episodes (\"Coast to Coast AM\" begins at 1 am ET/10 pm PT). Many existing \"Coast to Coast AM\" affiliates automatically carried Punnett's new program from its first night, and in subsequent months several new affiliates came on board. As of June 2007, its affiliate count stood around 200. Since his affiliation with \"C2CAM\" (especially during his tenure with \"Coast to Coast Live\"), Punnett developed a loyal following of his own. He always opened the show with the \"reminder\" to \"hostile invading aliens\" hovering just beyond Earth's atmosphere to \"eat the Canadians first\", saying they are \"much tastier\" than Americans. After the retirement of Art Bell in July 2007, \"Coast to Coast Live\" was discontinued, with Punnett once again becoming host of the Saturday night edition of \"C2CAM\". Show episodes with themes pertaining to cryptozoology or government conspiracies (favorite subjects of \"Coast to Coast AM\") were generally designated to Punnett and slotted for Saturday nights.\n\nOn December 3, 2011, Punnett announced that due to increasing problems with his tinnitus, that he would have to step down as regular Saturday night host of \"Coast to Coast AM\", being replaced by John B. Wells; as of January 2012, Punnett began hosting the show one Sunday per month.\n\nOn May 16, 2013, Punnett announced on the air with George Noory that he would no longer be hosting \"Coast to Coast\" one Sunday per month. Punnett hosted his then-last show on July 14, 2013, his 479th episode over 13 years.\n\nOn May 6, 2018, George Noory announced that Punnett would return as a host of \"Coast to Coast\", due to improvements in managing his tinnitus symptoms. Beginning in May 2018, Punnett has hosted several shows each month, as one of the show's designated fill-in hosts for nights when Noory was unavailable.\n\nPrior to becoming a father, pastor and host for \"Coast to Coast AM\", Punnett held many jobs before beginning his new career as a morning disc-jockey at a local radio station. According to a radio industry executive, Ian started hosting a radio show and the ratings went through the roof. And his general manager loved Punnett. After five years, Punnett decided to enroll in a seminary and eventually host \"Coast to Coast AM\".\n\nIn 2010, Punnett also published a children's book, \"Dizzy the Mutt with the Propeller Butt\". His second children's picture book \"Jackula the Vampire Dog\" was published in 2011.\n\nHis book \"How to Pray When You're Pissed at God\" was published in April, 2013 by Harmony. The book was inspired by Punnett's discovery during his duties as a chaplain that many religious Americans were uncomfortable expressing anger to clergy or in their prayers. His goal was to illustrate with examples from the Bible how expressing anger is acceptable, even anger towards God.\n\nPunnett entered the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University as a Ph.D. student in August 2013. He taught multimedia journalism at Ohio Northern University from 2016- 17. Punnett received his doctorate from Arizona State in 2017, after writing a dissertation titled \"Toward a Theory of True Crime: Forms and Functions of Nonfiction Murder Narratives.\" He is currently a faculty member at Kansas State University.\n\nFor children:\n\n \n"}

The station's playlist consisted of a mix of current and upbeat rhythmic pop/R&B/dance and classic disco from the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and today. The station also aired Whoopi Goldberg's syndicated morning show \"\"Wake Up With Whoopi\"\"\n\nThe KOOL Oldies format continued on KPLV's HD-2 channel, where The Greatest Hits of the 1960s and '70s ran commercial free, 24 hours a day. In 2008, it was replaced with a gay-oriented dance format from iHeart, known as Pride Radio. On August 29, 2015, KPLV-HD2 began stunting with Christmas music, which led into the September 4 debut of urban contemporary \"Real 103.9,\" simulcasted on translator K280DD 103.9 FM.\n\nBy 2010, KPLV moved to a more Top 40 format. In September 2010, KPLV was placed on Mediabase's Rhythmic panel. In April 2011, KPLV was moved to Mediabase's contemporary hit radio panel.\n\nOn July 1, 2012, KPLV rebranded as \"My 93.1\".\n\nOn April 12, 2015, KPLV temporarily rebranded as \"#WhatIs931?\" and used it as teasers. On April 17, 2015, at 9:31 a.m., after playing \"Latch\" by Disclosure, KPLV relaunched as \"93.1 The Party.\" Like sister station KPTT in Denver, it featured a Rhythmic/Dance Top 40 direction.\n\nOn September 26, 2016, at Noon, KPLV flipped to adult hits as \"93.1 The Mountain\". The format change brought the Variety Hits format to the market for the third time, as it was previously aired on KKJJ from June 2005 through August 2010 and KVGS from October 2011 through January 2015. On October 18, 2016, KPLV changed its call letters to KYMT to match the \"Mountain\" moniker.\n\nIn April 2018, KYMT shifted to a mainstream rock format, while retaining the \"Mountain\" moniker.\n\nIn 2019, KYMT began airing Las Vegas Raiders games in the team's last year in Oakland, California. It will become the flagship station of the team's radio network with the team's inaugural Las Vegas season in 2020.\n\n"}

In the United States, it often refers specifically to a version made primarily with ground (\"Indian\") corn, which sense is understood as intended in one verse of the early-American song \"Yankee Doodle\".\n\nSince at least the 16th century, a dish called hasty pudding has been found in British cuisine made of wheat flour that has been cooked in boiling milk or water until it reaches the consistency of a thick batter or an oatmeal porridge. It was a staple dish for the English for centuries. The earliest known recipes for hasty pudding date to the 17th century. There are three examples in Robert May's \"The Accomplisht Cook\". The first is made with flour, cream, raisins, currants and butter, the second recipe is for a boiled pudding and the third includes grated bread, eggs and sugar.\n\nHasty pudding was used by Hannah Glasse as a term for batter or oatmeal porridge in \"The Art of Cookery\" (1747). It's also mentioned in Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of 1755 as a combination of either milk and flour or oatmeal and water.\n\nNorth American recipes include wheat, oat, and corn-based puddings. In 1643 Roger Williams called the dish \"nasaump\": A North American version, known as \"corn mush\" or \"Indian mush\", is in its simplest form corn meal cooked slowly in water until it thickens. Like grits or polenta, it may be eaten hot, or left to cool and solidify, when slices of the cold pudding may then be fried. This hasty pudding was once a popular American food because of its low cost, long shelf life, and versatility, and was eaten with both sweet and savory accompaniments, such as maple syrup, molasses, or salted meat.\n\n\"\"Nasaump\", a kind of meale pottage, unpartch'd. From this the English call their samp, which is the Indian corne, beaten and boild, and eaten hot or cold, with milke or butter, which are mercies beyond the Natives plaine water, and which is a dish exceeding wholesome for the English bodies.\"\n\nEliza Leslie, an influential American cookbook author of the early 19th century, includes a recipe for flour hasty pudding in her 1840 \"Directions for Cookery, In Its Various Branches\", and calls the corn type \"Indian mush.\" She calls an oatmeal version \"burgoo\". She stresses the need for slow cooking rather than haste, and also recommends the use of a special \"mush-stick\" for stirring to prevent lumps. (This mush-stick is perhaps related to the spurtle, or the \"pudding stick\" of the nursery rhyme beating.)\n\nIndian pudding is a traditional New England dessert, \"a cold-weather classic.\" Seventeenth-century English colonists brought hasty pudding to North America and transformed it completely. Lacking wheat, they substituted cornmeal, a grain they learned to cultivate from the indigenous peoples, which led to the new name \"Indian pudding\", derived from their name for cornmeal, \"Indian meal\". They substituted milk, which was plentiful, for water and added locally available sweeteners, either molasses or maple syrup, and spices when available, typically cinnamon and ground ginger. Other traditional ingredients include butter and eggs for a smoother consistency and raisins and nuts for flavor and contrasting texture. Finally, Indian pudding is baked in a slow oven for several hours, transforming its texture from the porridge-like quality of hasty pudding to a smoother texture more typical of custard puddings. According to Kathleen Wall, Plimoth Plantation's expert on colonial cooking, \"The longer it cooks, the more liquid the gritty cornmeal absorbs, and the more it absorbs, the smoother the texture of your pudding.\" It was commonplace in the colonial era and enjoyed a revival as part of Thanksgiving Day celebrations in the late 19th century. It was found in most American cookbooks before 1900. The 20th century's commercial puddings with their industrially perfect smooth consistency displaced Indian pudding, and its cooking time had little appeal for the modern home cook. It is still associated with autumn holidays and occasionally revived by restaurants. It is usually served warm and sometimes accompanied by vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.\n\nHasty pudding is referred to in a verse of the early American song \"Yankee Doodle\":\n\nIt is also referenced in Louisa May Alcott's \"Little Men\" (1871): \"on their garden plot, Emil and Franz grow corn to supply the family with pudding and Johnny cake.\"\n\nIn the recipe for the Brazilian pudding (), sweet corn grains are taken raw together with milk and most often coconut milk to a blender until uniformly liquid, then cooked until it becomes thick; shredded coconut might be added in the last minutes; cinnamon powder is sprinkled at the end. When boiled wrapped in corn husks is called pamonha.\n\nPolenta is the savory Italian version of hasty pudding, with maize/corn substituted for the wheat originally used by the Romans.\n\n\n\n"}

A multi-instrumentalist, he is best known for his work in the musical/poetic genre of English Language nasheed and spoken word.\n\nBorn in Kitchener, Ontario in 1972, David Wharnsby became active in local theatrical productions during his early teens, first performing on a world-class theater stage at the age of 18 in a production of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" (Annas). Other stage work of his late teens included roles in \"You're A Good Man Charlie Brown\" (Schroeder) and \"Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead\".\n\nAt the age of 19 Wharnsby began performing throughout Southern Ontario as a solo musical artist and as a member of various musical groups. His first professional work as a musician was with folk quartet Crakenthorpe's Teapot, hired to perform on street corners of their hometown. Wharnsby travelled extensively throughout Ontario, England and Scotland during 1993 and 1994 as a solo busker – singing informally on street corners and in parks to market and share his music. In 1993 he started his own independent recording entity, Three Keyed Maple Seeds, which in 1996 was renamed Enter into Peace and registered with SOCAN as a music publishing entity.\n\nDuring the early 1990s Wharnsby worked as a professional actor and puppeteer for two different educational theater troupes, touring public schools and folk festivals throughout Ontario. At the age of 20 he played lead in a short educational film \"To Catch A Thief\", distributed nationally in Canada to schools as part of the John Howard Society's anti-shoplifting program.\n\nIn 1993, Dawud (David) Wharnsby and fellow Crackenthorpe's Teapot vocalist Heather Chappell began touring and performing as a duo, releasing an independent album (\"Off To Reap The Corn\") containing renditions of traditional Canadian and Irish folk music. The recording also featured Wharnsby's original lyrical adaptation of the traditional song \"The Black Velvet Band\". His comical version \"The Black Velvet Band as Never Before\" is still sung in folk music circles.\n\nDawud has released several internationally distributed albums since 1995, including Blue Walls and the Big Sky, \"Vacuous Waxing\" (with Canadian writer Bill Kocher), \"A Different Drum\" (with The Fletcher Valve Drummers) and \"Out Seeing The Fields\". In the mid-1990s Dawud began to work in the genre of English language nasheed (spiritual hymns of a folk/world-beat style, drawn from Qur'anic tradition). He has released over 10 popular albums of spiritual nasheed since 1993, including \"A Whisper of Peace\", \"Colours of Islam\", \"Road to Madinah\" and \"Sunshine Dust and the Messenger\", all released through US based media company Sound Vision.Com.\n\nSeptember 3, 2007 Dawud released \"Out Seeing the Fields\" composed of 12 tracks, co-produced with LA based pianist Idris Phillips. The 11th track of the album named \"Rachel\" is a tribute to Rachel Corrie who was killed by an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Caterpillar D9R armoured bulldozer, during an ISM protest against the destruction of Palestinian homes by the IDF in the Gaza Strip.\n\nDuring his career Dawud has collaborated with Stephen Fearing, Irshad Khan, Danny Thompson, Yusuf Islam (aka Cat Stevens), Zain Bhikha, Idris Phillips, Hadiqa Kiani and Atif Aslam.\n\nAs a television personality, Dawud has hosted programs produced in conjunction with Canada's Vision TV, the National Film Board of Canada, Al Huda TV (Saudi Arabia) and BBC Scotland.\n\nIn honour of author, screenwriter and lecturer Rod Serling, Wharnsby (inspired as a child by Serlings' work) is also a supporter of the Rod Serling Memorial Foundation and contributor to The Foundation's scholarship fund.\n\nDawud Wharnsby was declared an Ambassador of Scouting by the Scout Association in the UK as of June 2010.\n\nIn 1993, David Howard Wharnsby embraced the teachings of the Qur'an changing his name to \"Dawud\" (Arabic: داوود) – the Arabic form of \"David\" – and added the name \"Ali\" (Arabic: علي) to his surname. The name \"Ali\" was dropped from professional use in 2003, but remains a part of his legal name. Wharnsby has identified himself as a Muslim since 1993 and also adheres to the principals of Unitarian Universalism.\n\nMarried in 2003, Dawud Wharnsby, his wife and their two children reside seasonally in the state of Colorado, United States, Abbottabad, Pakistan and in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.\n\nThough family ties do exist, Dawud Wharnsby is not to be confused with film editor David Wharnsby, also a native of the Kitchener-Waterloo area.\n\nDawud Wharnsby was named in a November 21, 2008 article by \"The Sun\", as being a primary influence in an alleged conversion to the religion of Islam by pop star Michael Jackson. The article stated that Wharnsby and fellow musician Idris Phillips were \"pals\" of Michael Jackson and had talked to him \"about their beliefs, and how they thought they had become better people after they converted.\". The article was subsequently run by major print and television media worldwide.\n\nFollowing the death of Michael Jackson on June 25, 2009 the original \"Sun\" article resurfaced, intensifying rumours surrounding Jackson's religious affiliation and his alleged \"conversion\" to the religion of Islam through the counsel of Dawud Wharnsby and Idris Phillips. A June 26, 2009 public statement by Wharnsby, initially presented on his official website stated:\n\n\"For the record: Though our professional circles did cross-over slightly... I never had the honour or pleasure of meeting Michael Jackson personally, nor did we ever correspond on matters of our professions, personal lives or faiths.\"\n\nOn the topic of conversion, Wharnsby also stated:\n\n\"My approach to faith does not include concepts of \"conversion/reversion\" or \"propagation\", so the very idea that I would have even tried to \"convert\" Mr. Jackson (or anyone else for that matter) to my spiritual perspective, is silly.\"\n\nIn November 2009 Dawud Wharnsby's name was included in the category of \"Entertainment and The Arts\" on a list of the 500 Most Influential Muslims, compiled by The Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre (Jordan), and published with support of Georgetown University's Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding. Wharnsby was also included on the follow up lists of 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013/2014, and 2014/2015.\n\n\n\n"}

It breeds in tropical South America from Panama and Trinidad south to Bolivia and Argentina.\n\nThe pied water tyrant was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1779 in his \"Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux\" from a specimen collected in Cayenne, French Guiana. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the \"Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle\" which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name \"Muscicapa pica\" in his catalogue of the \"Planches Enluminées\". The pied water tyrant is now placed in the genus \"Fluvicola\" that was introduced by the English naturalist William John Swainson in 1827. The species in monotypic. The genus name is derived from a combination of Latin \"fluvius\" meaning \"river and \"-cola\" meaning \"dweller\". The specific epithet \"pica\" is Latin for \"magpie\".\n\nThe pied water tyrant is 13.5 cm long and weighs 13g. Adults are mainly white with a black nape, back, wings and tail. Sexes are similar, although the female may have some brown mixed with the black, and immature birds are brown where the adult is black. The call is a nasal \"djweeooo\".\n\nThis species is found in marshy savannahs and the edges of mangrove swamps. The nest is a feather-lined oval ball of grasses and other plant material, with a side entrance. It is placed at the end of a branch near or over water. Both sexes incubate the typical clutch of two or three creamy-white eggs, which are marked with a few brown spots. Cowbirds sometimes parasitise the nest.\n\nPied water tyrants often bob up and down when perched, and have a fluttering “butterfly” display flight. They forage for insects, their staple diet, in low waterside vegetation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2198615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198615", "title": "Prayer beads", "text": "Prayer beads\n\nPrayer beads are used by members of various religious traditions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism and the Bahá'í Faith to mark the repetitions of prayers, chants or devotions, such as the rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Catholicism, dhikr (remembrance of God) in Islam and jaap in Hinduism.\n\nBeads are among the earliest human ornaments and ostrich shell beads in Africa date to 10,000 BC. Over the centuries various cultures have made beads from a variety of materials from stone and shells to clay.\n\nThe English word bead derives from the Old English noun \"bede\" which means a prayer. The oldest image of a string of beads in a religious context and resembling a string of prayer beads is found on the fresco of the \"Adorants\" (or \"Worshipers\") at the Xeste 3 building of the prehistoric settlement of Akrotiri, Santorini (Thera,) Greece (Wall Paintings of Thera.) dating from the 17th c. BC (c. 1613 BC.) The exact origins of prayer beads remain uncertain, but their earliest historical use probably traces to Hindu prayers in India. Buddhism probably borrowed the concept from Hinduism. The statue of a Hindu holy man with beads dates to the third century BC.\n\nThe number of beads varies by religion or use. Islamic prayer beads, called Misbaha or Tasbih, usually have 100 beads (99 +1 = 100 beads in total or 33 beads read thrice and +1). Buddhists and Hindus use the Japa Mala, which usually has 108 beads, or 27 which are counted four times. Baha'i prayer beads consist of either 95 beads or 19 beads, which are strung with the addition of five beads below. The Sikh Mala also has 108 beads.\n\nRoman Catholics use the Rosary (Latin \"rosarium\", meaning \"rose garden\") with 59 beads. However, Eastern Orthodox Christians use a knotted prayer rope called either a komboskini or chotki, with 100 knots, although prayer ropes with 50 or 33 knots can also be used. In Vita of Saint Paul of Thebes (227 A.D. to 342 A.D.), written by Saint Jerome (347 A.D. to 420 A.D.) it states that Saint Paul of Thebes used pebbles and knotted cord to count prayers. Although Anglo-Catholics have used the Dominican rosary since the 19th century, in the 1980s Rev. Lynn Bauman from the Episcopal Church in the United States of America introduced a Rosary for Anglicans with 33 beads.\n\nThe Greek \"komboloi\" (which are worry beads and have no religious purpose) has an odd number of beads—usually one more than a multiple of four, e.g. (4x4)+1, (5x4)+1.\n\nSince the beads are fingered in an automatic manner, they allow the user to keep track of how many prayers have been said with a minimal amount of conscious effort, which in turn allows greater attention to be paid to the prayers themselves.\n\nA fresco picture dating from 1600 B.C., recently discovered in Akrotiri of Santorini (ancient Thira), shows women handling a prayer rope of beads.\n\nThe Desert Fathers of the 3rd to 5th centuries, used pebbles or knotted ropes to count prayers, typically the Jesus Prayer (\"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner\"). The invention is attributed to Anthony the Great or his associate Pachomius the Great in the 4th century.\n\nThe \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" mentions strings of beads, presumably for prayer, found in the tombs of Saint Gertrude of Nivelles (7th century) and Saint Norbert and Saint Rosalia (12th century). A more explicit reference is that in 1125 William of Malmesbury mentioned a string of gems that Lady Godiva used to count prayers.\n\nThese strings of beads were known as \"paternosters\" and were presumably used to count repetitions of the Lord's Prayer. Later, Roman Catholics and eventually Anglicans prayed the rosary with strings of 59 beads. The term \"rosary\" comes from the Latin \"rosarium\" \"rose garden\" and is an important and traditional devotion of the Catholic Church, combining prayer and meditation in sequences (called \"decades\") of the Lord's Prayer, 10 Hail Marys, and a Gloria Patri as well as a number of other prayers (such as the Apostles' Creed and the Salve Regina) at the beginning and end. The prayers are accompanied by meditation on the Mysteries, events in the life and ministry of Jesus. This traditional Catholic form of the rosary is attributed to Saint Dominic, though some Catholic writers have doubted this claim.\n\nCatholic rosary beads are composed of crucifix and center which can be made of sterling silver and/or gold, and beads which are usually made of glass, amethyst, rose quartz stone, crystal, black onyx, lavender glass or pearl, but all parts can be made of any material. Catholics also use prayer beads to pray chaplets.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church uses prayer ropes that usually come with 33, 50 or 100 knots. The loops of knotted wool (or occasionally of beads), called \"chotki\" or \"komboskini\" to pray the Jesus Prayer. Although among the Orthodox, their use is mainly restricted to monks and bishops, being less common among laity or secular clergy. Among Russian Old Believers, a prayer rope made of leather, called 'lestovka', is more common, although this type is no longer commonly used now by the Russian Orthodox Church. According to the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\", \"The rosary is conferred upon the Greek Orthodox monk as a part of his investiture with the mandyas or full monastic habit, as the second step in monastic life, and is called his 'spiritual sword'.\" Ethiopian and Coptic prayer rope (called \"mequetaria/mequteria\") employ numbers such as 41, 64, and 100 as their length and is primarily used for reciting the Kyrie Eleison. In regards to the first two numbers, the former represent the number of wounds inflicted on Jesus from lashing, the nails, and the lance while the latter represents Mary's age upon her Assumption.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Anglican prayer beads or \"Christian prayer beads\" was developed in the Episcopal Church of the United States by Episcopalians participating in a study group dealing with methods of prayer. The set consists of 33 beads (representing the 33 years of the life of Christ) arranged in four groupings of symbolic significance. These \"Anglican Rosaries\" continue to be promoted via internet websites but it is not known whether they have been adopted by any Protestant group in any formal sense. Many Anglo-Catholics use the Catholic rosary and may also be using Anglican prayer beads.\n\nThe contemporary Wreath of Christ, invented by Martin Lönnebo, Bishop Emeritus of the Diocese of Linköping of the Swedish Lutheran Church, is a set of 18 beads, some round and some elongated, arranged in an irregular pattern. Each one has its own significance as a stimulus and reminder for meditation, although they can also be used for repetitive prayer.\n\nWhile there are liturgical churches using prayer beads in prayer, non-liturgical Christian churches do not use them.\n\nIn Islam, prayer beads are referred to as Misbaha (Arabic: مسبحة \"mas'baha\" ), Tasbih or Sibha and contain 99 normal-sized beads, (corresponding to the Names of God in Islam) and two smaller or mini beads separating every 33 beads. Sometimes only 33 beads are used, in which case one would cycle through them three times. The beads are traditionally used to keep count while saying the prayer. The prayer is considered a form of dhikr that involves the repetitive utterances of short sentences in the praise and glorification of Allah, in Islam. The prayer is recited as follows: 33 times \"Subhan Allah\" (Glory be to God), 33 times \"Al-hamdu lilah\" (Praise be to God), and 33 times \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is the greatest) which equals 99, the number of beads in the misbaha.\n\nTo keep track of counting either the phalanges of the right hand or a misbaha is used. Use of the misbaha to count prayers and recitations is considered an acceptable practice within mainstream Islam. While they are widely used today in Sunni and Shia Islam, adherents of the Salafi sects shun them as an intolerable innovation. \n\nAhmadiyya\n\nIn the Ahmadiyya religion, misbaha and other forms of prayer beads are considered an “innovation”. According to Mirza Tahir Ahmad of the Ahmadiyya community, the use of prayer beads is a form of innovation which was not practised by the early Muslim community\n\nSikh worshipers may use \"mala\" (prayer beads) while reciting verses from the Guru Granth Sahib. These prayer beads may be used as a part of the Sikh attire and worn around turbans or wrists.\n\nAn early use of prayer beads can be traced to Hinduism where they are called \"japa mala\". Japa is the repeating of the name of a deity or a mantra. \"Mala\" ( ) means \"garland\" or \"wreath\".\nJapa mala are used for repetition of a mantra, for other forms of sādhanā or \"spiritual exercise\" and as an aid to meditation. The most common \"mala\" have 108 beads. The most common materials used for making the beads are Rudraksha seeds (used by Shaivites) and Ocimum tenuiflorum (\"tulsi\") stems (used by Vaishnavites).\n\nAccording to Vedic scriptures 103 beads were used during Treta Yuga, 108 beads during Dvapara Yuga, and 111 beads in Kali Yuga.\n\nPrayer beads (, , (yeomju), ) are also used in many forms of Mahayana Buddhism, often with a lesser number of beads (usually a divisor of 108). In Pure Land Buddhism, for instance, 27-bead \"mala\"s are common. These shorter malas are sometimes called \"prostration rosaries\" because they are easier to hold when enumerating repeated prostrations. In Tibetan Buddhism malas are also 108 beads: one mala counts as 100 mantras, and the eight extra are meant to be dedicated to all sentient beings (the practice as a whole is dedicated at its end as well). In Tibetan Buddhism, often larger malas are used; for example, malas of 111 beads. When counting, they calculate one mala as 100 mantras and the 11 additional beads are taken as extra to compensate for errors.\n\nVarious type of materials are used to make mala beads such as seeds of the rudraksha, beads made from the wood of the tulsi plant, animal bone, wood or seeds from the Bodhi Tree (a particularly sacred tree of the species Ficus religiosa) or of Nelumbo nucifera (the lotus plant). Semi-precious stones like carnelian and amethyst are also used. Another commonly used material is sandalwood.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith stipulates that the verse Alláh-u-Abhá \"God the All-Glorious\" be recited 95 times daily after the performance of ablutions. To help facilitate this recitation Bahá’ís often use prayer beads, though they are not required to. Most commonly, Bahá’í prayer beads consist of 95 individual beads on a strand or a strand of 19 beads with 5 set counters. In the latter case, the person reciting the verses typically tracks the 19 individual verses in a set with one hand and tracks the sets of verses with the other (19 verses times 5 sets for a total of 95 total verses). Bahá’í prayer beads are made of any number of natural and man-made materials including glass, precious and semi-precious stones, various metals and wood. There are no traditions regarding the structure of the prayer bead strand or the materials used.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is headquartered in the GMA Network Center in Quezon City and its transmitter, Tower of Power, is located at Tandang Sora Avenue, Barangay Culiat also in Quezon City.\n\nThe original meaning of the GMA acronym was Greater Manila Area, referring to the initial coverage area of the station. As the network expanded it changed into Global Media Arts. GMA's flagship television station is DZBB-TV which carries VHF Channel 7 (analog broadcast) and UHF Channel 15 (digital broadcast). The network has 4 originating stations and 48 relay stations nationwide. Its programming is also available outside the Philippines through GMA Pinoy TV, GMA Life TV and GMA News TV International.\n\nThe origin of GMA Network can be traced back to Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc. through DZBB, which started airing its radio broadcast on March 1, 1950, and officially launched as a local radio station in Manila on June 14, 1950 and owned by Robert La Rue \"Uncle Bob\" Stewart, an American war correspondent. Venturing into television in the 1960s, Stewart started RBS TV Channel 7 (under the call letters DZBB-TV) on October 29, 1961, becoming the Philippines' fifth terrestrial television station. Originally, RBS's programming was composed of foreign programs from the United States and it later produced local programs to cater to Filipino audiences. It produced shows like \"Uncle Bob's Lucky Seven Club\", a child-oriented show aired every Saturdays; \"Dance Time with Chito\"; and various news programs like \"News at Seven\". In 1963, RBS launched its first provincial television station in Cebu, DYSS Channel 7 (now GMA Cebu). In the same year, from Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc, the firm was formally renamed to Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. (RBS).\n\nOn September 21, 1972, then President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law by the virtue of Proclamation 1081. Marcos, ruling by decree, curtailed press freedom and other civil liberties; closed down the Congress and media establishments including RBS. In December 1972, RBS was given the green light by the government to return on the air, however with limited three-month permits. Programming during that time was supplied mostly via a blocktime agreement with Philippine Production Center Inc. (PPCI), a company led by former ABS-CBN executive Romeo Jalosjos. But due to limited licenses, difficulty in financial obligations, and disallowing foreign citizens and entities from owning and operating media companies in the Philippines, Stewart and the American Broadcasting Company, who owned a quarter of the company, was forced to cede majority control to a triumvirate composed of Gilberto Duavit Sr., a Malacañang official; Menardo Jimenez, an accountant; and Felipe Gozon, an attorney of the Stewarts in 1974; and the station changed its name to GMA Radio-Television Arts (GMA stood for Greater Manila Area, the station's initial coverage area); though Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. remained as its corporate name until 1996. His wife Loring was the president when the takeover ensued. The relaunched GMA, aside from sporting a light blue square logo with the network name in white, also (until 1980) had a circle 7 logo in use, in its final years the blue circle 7 logo used was similar to those used by the ABC in some United States cities.\n\nAfter that, Rod Reyes, the then-general manager of RBS recruited old-timers from ABS-CBN, including from the news department and entertainment programs. Through the acquisition, the station was able to broadcast in color with a ₱8 million credit line thru buying telecine machines and acquired foreign programs. Ratings were up from #5 to #3 that time.\n\nWhen Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino, Jr., a senator who strongly opposed the Marcos administration, was assassinated on August 21, 1983, it was only a small item on television news. The iron grip that the Marcos administration had on television began to slip, as GMA broadcast the funeral, the only local station to do so. In 1984, Imee Marcos, daughter of Ferdinand Marcos, attempted to take over GMA. However, the takeover was prevented by GMA executives. Stewart left the Philippines for good as he was utterly disappointed with the Marcos move. GMA was also instrumental during the years preceding the People Power Revolution. The network was the first to air a television interview with Corazon Aquino via \"Viewpoint\" in 1984, and when she later announced that she would run for the presidency if she receives one million signatures. In February 1986, the network was also the first to report that Fidel Ramos and Juan Ponce Enrile broke away from the Marcos administration. GMA's rival ABS-CBN reopened on September 1986 but the network continued to operate.\n\nWhen democracy in the Philippines was restored in the People Power Revolution in 1986, television stations began to air, some with their original owners. The political instability of the country also added to the station's burden, when soldiers stormed into the studios for two days in a part of coup attempt to topple then president, Corazon Aquino. In 1987, it became the first VHF television network in the country to provide a new dimension to viewers by broadcasting the network's programs in full stereo (dubbed as \"GMA StereoVision\"), it opened its high-end live studio, the Broadway Centrum, boosting its local programming, and inaugurated its 777-foot \"Tower of Power\" located along Tandang Sora, Quezon City, the tallest man-made structure in the country on November 7, 1988.\n\nOn March 20, 1992, Congress passed Republic Act No. 7252, otherwise known as \"An Act Granting the Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. A Franchise to Construct, Install, Operate and Maintain Radio and Television Broadcasting Stations in the Philippines,\" granting GMA a legislative franchise for the operation of radio and television broadcasting stations, in particular, \"to construct, install, operate and maintain for commercial purposes and in the public interest, radio and television broadcasting stations in the Philippines with the corresponding auxiliary, special broadcast and other program and distribution services and relay stations, and to install radio communications facilities for private use in its broadcast services\" for a period of 25 years.\n\nUnder Jimenez, Gozon and Executive Vice President Antonio C. Barreiro, international reach became GMA's target in the 1990s, which began when the \"Rainbow Satellite\" launched on April 26, 1992. Through its relay stations, GMA programs were seen across the archipelago and Southeast Asia. GMA programming started airing in 60 American cities and parts of South America through the \"International Channel Network\". GMA was the official broadcaster of the 1995 World Youth Day, which was the last visit of Pope John Paul II to the country. During the same year, two popular TV shows, \"Eat Bulaga!\" and \"Okay Ka, Fairy Ko!\" began broadcasting on GMA after TAPE Inc. refused ABS-CBN's proposal to buy the airing rights of the two shows. At the same time, GMA launched a UHF channel subsidiary, Citynet 27, several new shows (among them was Bubble Gang one of the longest-running shows on TV today), and the news program, \"Saksi\" with Mike Enriquez, Mel Tiangco and Karen Davila. It also has the Asian adaptation of The 700 Club series as The 700 Club Asia which the Philippines is the only originating country in Asia.\n\nIn 1995, GMA founded its film production company, \"Cinemax Studios\" (later renamed to GMA Films in 1998) with the film \"Run Barbi Run\". Its film \"José Rizal\" released in 1998, which was at that time the most expensive movie production ever in the country (costing over 80 million pesos to produce), became a huge success with many accolades and award nominations.\nEat Bulaga! is also included into its schedule in 1995 after moving out from ABS-CBN and is still airing in this network ever since.\n\nOn May 16, 1996, GMA formally changed its corporate name to \"GMA Network Incorporated\", with GMA now standing for \"Global Media Arts\". GoBingo, initially aired in 1996, is an interactive game show hosted by Arnell Ignacio, with Maricar de Mesa as the first \"GobiGirl\". In 1998, GMA pioneered on Filipino language late night news broadcast with the news program \"GMA Network News\" as the first Filipino-language late-night television newscast after it was debuted six years ago as an English-language late-night newscast, as English newscasts were started since the introduction of television in the country in 1953. As the newscast fasten to higher than its English newscasts, all networks start to follow including IBC in 1998, ABS-CBN in 1999, RPN in 2000, NBN (now PTV) in 2001 and ABC (now TV5) in 2004.\n\nGMA was the first Philippine broadcaster to receive a Peabody Award for Investigative Reporting in 1999. Later, Citynet 27 became EMC, the first locally programmed music video channel, later becoming a part of the Channel V franchise called Channel V Philippines. Channel V the Philippines, however, ceased operations due to a conflict of interest between the owners of GMA and PLDT (which bought a stake in GMA), who operate MTV Philippines through their subsidiary, the Nation Broadcasting Corporation. GMA was also the Philippine broadcaster for \"2000 Today\", the most-successful international television special that commemorated the dawn of the new millennium. At the turn of the millennium, GMA was the only local network to go on 24-hour, non-stop broadcasting (However, in 2001, the network reduced back to regular broadcast hours for its regular transmitter maintenance due to NTC's rules and regulations for affiliated free-to-air TV stations). At the beginning of the year, Menardo Jimenez announced his retirement as president and CEO (he would later be assumed office as a member of the board of directors of San Miguel Corporation in 2002) and on December 31, 2000, Felipe Gozon assumed the position with his concurrent capacity as chairman. Duavit's son Gilberto Duavit Jr. assumed the post of the chief operating officer.\n\nOn October 27, 2002, during an episode of the network's noontime show \"SOP\", GMA officially revealed a new logo and image campaign. The new logo features a rainbow-colored heart-shaped logo, the Kapuso, represented by a new slogan \"Kapuso ng Pamilyang Pilipino, Anumang Kulay ng Buhay\" (\"One in Heart With the Filipino family, In Whatever Colors of Life\"), and a Century Gothic Bold font for the letters. The \"Kapuso\" theme song is sung by Regine Velasquez.\n\nIn 2003, \"Saksi\" won the New York Television Festival Gold Medal for best newscast, the first Philippine newscast to do so. This and the Peabody Award in 1999 earned the network a House of Representatives commendation later that year. On September 1 of the same year, GMA Network withdrew its membership from the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP), after incidents involving host Rosanna Roces, alleged commercial overloading and interfering when news anchor Mike Enriquez aired his complaints about his radio program, \"Saksi sa Dobol B\", against Lopez-owned cable firm Sky Cable's distortion of GMA's signal on its system, and a lost videotape containing evidence that the cable firm had violated the rule on soliciting ads for cable TV. GMA was an official TV network of the 4th World Meeting of Families held in Manila, Philippines.\n\nIn 2004, GMA launched line up of new programs and primetime shows such as \"Te Amo, Maging Sino Ka Man\", \"Hanggang Kailan\", \"Forever in My Heart\", \"Marinara\", as well as, \"Bahay Mo Ba 'To?\", \"Naks!\", \"Lovely Day\", \"StarStruck Kids\", \"Ikaw sa Puso Ko\", \"Leya, ang Pinakamagandang Babae sa Ilalim ng Lupa\", \"30 Days\", \"Wag Kukurap\", \"Pinoy Pop Superstar\", \"SOP Gigsters\", \"Joyride\", \"3R\", \"Out\", \"Bitoy's Funniest Videos\" and the network's new early evening newscast 24 Oras.\n\nIn 2005, the company's subsidiary, Citynet Network Marketing and Productions, Inc., signed a co-production and block time agreement with ZOE Broadcasting Network, allowing the GMA Network with another platform to showcase its programming and talents. On November 11, 2005, ZOE's flagship station, DZOE-TV Channel 11, went on the air as \"Quality TeleVision\" (later known as Q and was reformatted to become GMA News TV), and broadcast shows that primarily targeted women audiences. Q's news programs shared the same resources of GMA News and Public Affairs, while some programs are produced by Citynet Network Marketing and Productions, Inc. Also in 2005, GMA won the Asian Television Awards' Best Terrestrial Television Station, besting MBC of Korea and Mediacorp Channel 5 of Singapore. The network planned to go public, but due to political instability and the downward trend of broadcast advertising, it was delayed.\n\nIn 2006, \"Debate with Mare at Pare\", a late-night public affairs program, won the bronze medal in the New York Television Festival. The network was also praised on its coverage of the \"Wowowee\" (a program of ABS-CBN) stampede by local publications. In an exclusive interview, a reprehensive Mike Enriquez interviewed embattled Philippine president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, for the first time since the lifting of the State of National Emergency, which the network allowed other stations to air without prior consent. At the end of the interview, the president praised the network for its news coverage, hinting that other media outfits to do the same.

Gozon, Gilberto Duavit, Jr., and Joel Marcelo Jimenez.\n\nOn October 29, 1961, Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc. launches its first television station in the Philippines, known back then as RBS TV Channel 7. GMA Network began branding its identity by eliminating call signs to its network identification.\n\nGMA Network has used a number of logos throughout its history especially when Gozon, Jimenez, and Duavit acquired the station in 1975. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, the network used the Circle 7 logo for its Metro Manila and Cebu stations, which is also expended by several networks around the world (predominately the O&O stations of ABC in the United States). In the 1980s, to refine its presence in the Philippine broadcast industry, GMA Network used the slogan \"Where You Belong\", and lasted for two decades before invigorating to another catchphrase. In 1992, GMA Network redefines itself as the Rainbow Network, succeeding the ensigns of the rainbow. Throughout the 1990s, the network developed the logo before having it replaced by its current logo in 2002 and as the Kapuso Network. After a huge marketing campaign, and improved television ratings, the new insignia (the rainbow-colored stylized heart-shape logo known as Kapuso) is now one of the most recognizable in the Philippines.\n\nKapuso ng Bawat Pilipino (One in Heart with Every Filipino) is the secondary characteristic catchphrase of GMA Network. The slogan was initially used in conjunction with the rebranding of GMA Network as the Kapuso Network on October 27, 2002. But another slogan of the network Kapuso, Anumang Kulay ng Buhay (One in Heart, in Every Colors of Life) is still used in other purposes and this is the official theme song title for the network. GMA Network's news and public affairs department meanwhile uses the slogan \"Serbisyong Totoo\" (\"True Service\"). It is one of the longest running slogans used for news broadcast promotion. GMA Network found itself on the other end of a battle concerning the slogan, when ABS-CBN News Channel uses similar catchphrase, and immediately discontinued in order to avoid legal predicament from GMA Network. In 2006, its news department also used an accompanying slogan, \"Just News,\" for its promotional campaign together with its news media partners, INQ7.Net.\n\nGMA Network television programming comprises news, public affairs, sports, fictional, variety shows, dramas, musicals, soap operas, children's and talk shows, reality programs, cartoons and anime and movie blocks. Most of its programs are broadcast live and taped in its GMA Network Centers and Studios located in Metropolitan Manila. GMA Network currently programs 20.5 hours of programming per day. It provides 34.5 hours of prime-time programming per week to its owned and affiliated stations: on Weekdays, 4:25–10:00 p.m. on Mondays to Thursdays, 10:00 p.m.–12:35 a.m. on Fridays, 10:00 p.m.–12:30 a.m. on Saturdays, 4:30 p.m.–12:55 a.m. on Sundays.

Reality show \"Extra Challenge\" started to lead the ratings and with launch of \"telefantasya\" \"Mulawin\". On September 23, 2004, GMA Network gained leadership in Mega Manila against its closest competitor. In 2005, GMA Network began producing \"Mars Ravelo's Darna\", a classic Filipino comic book character which became a hit, with an overnight rating of 47.7 percent, the highest rating for a pilot episode and the first \"telefantasya\" to reach 52.1 percent ratings; followed by \"Encantadia\" at 47.2 percent and other prime-time \"telefantasyas\", \"Mulawin\" (2004) and \"Sugo\" (2005) contributed to GMA Network lead in Mega Manila. In 2006, GMA Network maintained its prime time supremacy by reformatting its reality-based program \"Extra Challenge\" and another \"telefantasya\" \"Encantadia\" (which was succeeded by \"Etheria\" and \"\"), and the localized subtitled versions of Korean television series \"Stairway to Heaven\", \"Full House\", \"Jewel in the Palace\" and \"My Lovely Sam Soon\".\n\nIn 2007, GMA Network started producing the local version of a Mexican television series \"MariMar\". For its pilot episode, it got 52.6 percent overnight rating, making it the only soap opera to achieve the highest ratings in GMA Network's history. In a 2006 survey conducted by Pulse Asia, seven out of 10 Metro Manila-based viewers find GMA Network a more credible network than its competitor. GMA Network managed to lead in Mega Manila and Southern Luzon demographic, which has the highest concentration of television ownership and 79 percent of advertisement placement.\n\nThe National Urban Television Audience Measurement was officially launched on October 16, 2006, to determine the television ratings and the audience share of local TV programs from urban areas in the Philippines. This changes the broadcast industry landscape and the manner in which the advertisers allocate their TV investments to achieve cost efficiency and maximization. In August 2007 audience rating data shows GMA Network maintained its lead in Mega Manila, which resulted to a 23 percent growth in its consolidated net income to ₱1.13 billion in the first half of the year from ₱915 million in the same period last year. GMA Network income grew by 23 percent year-on-year to ₱1.126 billion in the first six months of the year. Mega Manila accounts 49 percent of total TV households. The Mega Manila and Luzon markets combined accounts for 76 percent of the total TV households. It earned ₱2.3 billion in 2007. In 2011, GMA Network maintained the lead in the national television ratings mentioning figures from Nielsen TV Audience Measurement for January 1 to February 13, 2011. It had 33.2 percent audience shared based on overnight data, higher than ABS-CBN's 31.8 percent and TV5's 14.9 percent. It also leads in Urban Luzon, which makes up 77 percent of total television households in the Philippines. GMA Network posted 9.8 point lead with 36.5 points compared with the closest competitor, ABS-CBN's 26.7 points and imposing a 19.6 point lead from TV5's 16.9. GMA Network also sustained to beat ABS-CBN in Mega Manila, which accounts for 58 percent of television household. It got 37.7 percent share over ABS-CBN 25.2 percent and TV5's 17.7 percent, 20 points higher.\n\nOn July 22, 2004, Breaking news during the arrival of Angelo de la Cruz at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (a truck driver who was held hostage and threatened with beheading in Iraq abducted by armed rebels west of Baghdad while trucking fuel from Saudi Arabia), live news coverage was aired on GMA Network and other local television stations in the Philippines. GMA Network used audio-video coverage through the facilities of Reuters, which GMA Network subscribed to. During the said broadcast, a live feed from Reuters was simultaneously aired with its own live broadcast. During the first five-second of the live feed, GMA Network did notice that the live feed from Reuters was also airing at another local station, its main competitor ABS-CBN. The live video was restricted only to ABS-CBN and Reuters did not inform GMA Network that the video coverage was only intended for ABS-CBN. The local Court of Appeals junked the case filed by ABS-CBN Corporation against GMA Network Inc. for what was claimed to be illegal copying of its live video footage. In a ruling, the local fourth division of the appellate court set aside the resolution of the local Justice Department, which approved the filing of the violation of Republic Act 8293 (or the Intellectual Property Code) against GMA Network. It ruled out that the act of GMA Network in airing the live video coverage was focused by good faith since there was no meaning to instigate damage to ABS-CBN Corporation. The local court also said GMA Network acted in good faith when it decided to instantaneously stop using the live video feed from Reuters upon learning ABS-CBN was also covering the said news event and its following exertion to authenticate the ABS-CBN Corporation restriction arrangement with the news service, Reuters. The local court also stressed that apart from lack of intent of GMA Network to affect the video from ABS-CBN, the action also cannot be reflected intrusion of Sections 212.4 and 185.1 of Republic Act 8293 since it was just a short excerpt compared with the totality of the matter.\n\nOn December 20, 2007, Judge Charito Gonzales of Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 80 released a temporary restraining order on TV ratings surveys based on a civil case filed by then ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation (now ABS-CBN Corporation) versus AGB Nielsen Media Research Philippines. ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation accused competitor GMA Network Inc. of funding bribing operations in Bacolod City, to discredit the former. The local court in the Philippines further ordered ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation to file comment on the plea of AGB Nielsen Media Research Philippines for the alleged gathering and dissemination of television ratings data, within five days or until December 22, 2007. On December 21, 2007, a local AM radio station in the Philippines, owned by ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation, DZMM field reporter Junrie Hidalgo reported a news story entitled \"AGB Nielsen, umamin sa dayaan: GMA Network, tahasang itinurong nasa likod ng dayaan\" (\"AGB Nielsen admits to cheating: GMA Network aggressively accused of being behind the cheating\") during the radio program of \"Showbiz Mismo\", hosted by Cristy Fermin and Jobert Sucaldito. The news story is based on an interview of AGB Nielsen general manager Maya Reforma regarding the purported cheating. In response, GMA Network Inc. aired a television plug reproving the purported unfair journalism and disagreed the accusations of ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation. GMA Network Inc. later filed a ₱15 million civil libel suit against ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation on January 3, 2008. The respondents included Hidalgo, Fermin, Sucaldito, the station and news manager of DZMM, writers and executive producers of television programs \"Bandila\", \"Entertainment Live\" and \"The Buzz\" after the same story was aired locally. On January 7, 2008, the Quezon City Regional Trial Court junked ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation's suit against AGB Nielsen, saying the case was \"prematurely filed\" before the local court. Judge Gonzales' basis is the principle of mutuality of contracts, citing Article 1308 and 1196, New Civil Code of the Philippines. Also, Judge Samuel Gaerlan, Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 92 issued court summons against ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation and 15 of its personnel on January 3, 2008. On January 17, 2008, Judge Gaerlan recused himself from the case, considering that he has a cousin working in the legal department of ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation. The case was later re-raffled on January 28, 2008, and the case was eventually assigned to Judge Henri Inting of Branch 95 of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court. On February 14, 2008, Judge Inting issued a temporary restraining order barring local television station, ABS-CBN from airing defamatory statements against GMA Network Inc.\n\nIn December 2008, GMA Network Inc., Citynet Television, and ZOE Broadcasting Network filed a lawsuit against the management of TV5, alleging MPB Primedia Inc. (a subsidiary of Media Prima Berhad, a Malaysian company, which entered a block time agreement with Associated Broadcasting Company to sell the airtime of TV5) of violating Article XVI, Section 3, of the 1987 Philippine Constitution. GMA Network Inc. argues restriction of foreign entities to operate and own a Filipino company especially on broadcast media. GMA Network Inc. disputes MPB Primedia Inc. that it was established to skirt the anti-dummy laws and enter into an unlawful block time deal.\n\n"}

The 9K111 Fagot missile system was developed by the Tula KBP Design Bureau for Instrument Building. \"9M111\" is the GRAU designation of the missile. Its NATO reporting name is AT-4 Spigot. \n\nThe 9K111 Fagot was developed by the Tula Machinery Design Bureau (Tula KBP) and development began in 1962 with the aim of producing the next generation of SACLOS ATGMs for use in both the man portable role and the tank destroyer role. The 9K111 Fagot was developed alongside the 9M113 Konkurs; both missiles use similar technology, only differing in size, and can use the same launchers. The missile entered service in 1970.\n\nThe anti-tank platoon of a Soviet BTR equipped motor rifle battalion had two (sometimes three) ATGM squads, each with two 9K111 Fagot teams. The team consisted of three men; the gunner carries the 9P135 launcher and tripod as a back pack, and the other two men each carry two launch tubes. The men also carry assault rifles, but do not carry an RPG, because unlike the earlier missiles there is only a small deadzone within which the missile cannot engage the target. Besides the four missiles carried by each team, each squad would normally have an extra eight missiles carried in their transport, usually a BTR. It can also be deployed from the BMP-1P, BMD-1P, BTR-D and UAZ-469.\n\nNorth Korea was said to have acquired a number of the systems during the late 1980s until the 2000s from the USSR. These were subsequently reverse-engineered under the designation Bulsae-2. Its use was first reported in 2014 in the ranks of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades and the Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades.\n\nThe missile is stored and carried in a container/launch tube. It is fired from a 9P135 launcher post, a simple tripod. A 9S451 guidance box is fitted to the tripod with the missile sitting just above. The 9Sh119 sight is fitted to the left side (from the gunner's POV). The complete launcher system weighs . The gunner lays prone while firing. The system can engage moving targets travelling at less than . The launcher post can traverse through 360 degrees horizontally, and +/− 20 degrees in elevation. The sight has a magnification of 10x and a 5 degree field of view. Up to three missiles a minute can be fired from a launcher post.\n\nThe system uses a gas generator to push the missile out of the launch tube, which exits from the rear of the launch tube in a manner similar to a recoilless rifle. The missile leaves the launch tube at , and is then quickly accelerated to by its solid fuel motor. This initial high speed reduces the missile's deadzone, since it can be launched directly at the target, rather than in an upward arc.\n\nThe launcher tracks the position of an incandescent infrared bulb on the back of the missile relative to the target and transmits appropriate commands to the missile via a thin wire that trails behind the missile. The SACLOS guidance system has many benefits over MCLOS, with the accuracy of the system stated as 90% in some sources, though its performance is probably comparable to the TOW or the later SACLOS versions of the 9K11 Malyutka.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Also operating over this route was the \"Ann Rutledge\", which originated in Chicago. In January 2009, Amtrak consolidated these trains under the name \"Missouri River Runner\".\n\nAmtrak introduced the two trains on October 26, 1980, in partnership with the state of Missouri, which provided a yearly subsidy of $484,000. It ran along a route that had been served for most of the 20th century by the Missouri Pacific Railroad. When Amtrak began in 1971, the route became the western leg of the \"National Limited,\" which ran from New York City to Kansas City. That train, in turn, was the successor of the famed \"Spirit of St. Louis,\" which had run from 1927 to 1971. \n\nThe \"National Limited\" was discontinued due to budget cuts in 1979, reducing service along the St. Louis-Kansas City corridor to just one train, the \"Ann Rutledge,\" which ran from Chicago to Kansas City via St. Louis. Missouri officials wanted to maintain the same level of service between the state's two major cities, and urged Amtrak to preserve a regional service for the state to supplement the \"Ann Rutledge.\"\n\nAlthough the two trains shared the same route, the eastbound train was known as the \"St. Louis Mule\" while the westbound train was called the \"Kansas City Mule\". Contemporary news accounts referred to the combined service as the \"Missouri Mule\", although Amtrak timetables used the individual names.\n\nThe \"Mules\" originally stopped at Kirkwood, Jefferson City, Sedalia and Warrensburg. Amtrak added Lee's Summit and Washington as flag stops in April 1981 on a one-year trial basis; Lee's Summit was retained in 1982 while Washington was dropped late 1981 in favor of Independence. Amtrak reinstated Washington on the October 29, 1995 timetable for another one-year trial period; this time Amtrak retained the stop. Hermann became a permanent stop on September 28, 1991. Trains had previously stopped only during Hermann's annual \"Maifest\" and \"Octoberfest\".\n\nBetween April 29, 1984 and November 4, 1993 the \"Mules\" operated with the \"River Cities\", a St. Louis section of the \"City of New Orleans\". Additional cars were added between St. Louis and Carbondale, Illinois, where it connected with the New Orleans-bound train. A funding crisis caused Amtrak to discontinue the \"Mules\" between April 1 and July 1, 1995.\n\nBecause the tracks are owned by Union Pacific (UP), freight trains had priority over passenger trains. This often resulted in severe delays for Amtrak, such as those seen in May 2007, when the Missouri Department of Transportation blamed UP for the disruptions.\n\n"}

He returned home in 1942 with wounds suffered on the German front in World War 2. He became head of the Uzbekistan Writers Union in 1949, and was elected to the post of Chairman of the Praesidium of the Uzbek Supreme Soviet in 1950. In 1959, he became First Secretary of the Uzbek Communist Party, a post he held to his death in 1983.\n\nIn the Soviet Union his name became synonymous with corruption, nepotism and the Great Cotton Scandal of the late Brezhnev period. As orders from Moscow to grow increasing quantities of cotton, the Uzbek government responded by reporting miraculous growth in land irrigated and harvested, and record improvements in production and efficiency. Today it would seem that most of these records were falsified. The Uzbek leadership used these exaggerated figures to transfer substantial amounts of wealth from central Soviet funds into Uzbekistan. Rashidov died on 31 October 1983 in Jizzakh. Immediately after his death, rumors spread that he had realized he was about to be disgraced and thus committed suicide. However, this has never been confirmed.\nDuring the decade following the death of Rashidov, Moscow attempted to regain the central control over the Uzbek SSR, which had weakened in the previous decade. In 1986, it was announced that almost the entire party and government leadership of the republic had conspired in falsifying cotton production figures. A massive purge of the Uzbek leadership was carried out, with prosecutors brought in from Moscow, leading to widespread arrests, executions, and suicides. It may never be known how high the corruption extended, as Brezhnev’s own son-in-law, Yuri Churbanov was implicated in the affair. In the rest of the Soviet Union, Uzbekistan became synonymous with corruption even though such corruption was widespread throughout the whole Union. After Uzbekistan's independence, Rashidov re-emerged as a national hero. He is seen in Uzbekistan as having been a strong leader who found a way to cleverly defy Moscow and \"beat the system” while managing to create a situation where Uzbekistan became quite of central control.\n\n"}
{"id": "2198661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198661", "title": "Trypanosoma brucei", "text": "Trypanosoma brucei\n\nTrypanosoma brucei is a species of parasitic kinetoplastid belonging to the genus \"Trypanosoma\". The parasite is the cause of a vector-borne disease of vertebrate animals, including humans, carried by genera of tsetse fly in sub-Saharan Africa. In humans \"T. brucei\" causes African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness. In animals it causes animal trypanosomiasis, also called nagana in cattle and horses. \"T. brucei\" has traditionally been grouped into three subspecies: \"T. b. brucei\", \"T. b. gambiense\" and \"T. b. rhodesiense\". The first is a parasite of non-human vertebrates, while the latter two are the known parasites of humans. Only rarely can the \"T. b. brucei\" infect a human.\n\n\"T. brucei\" is transmitted between mammal hosts by an insect vector belonging to different species of tsetse fly (\"Glossina\"). Transmission occurs by biting during the insect's blood meal. The parasites undergo complex morphological changes as they move between insect and mammal over the course of their life cycle. The mammalian bloodstream forms are notable for their cell surface proteins, variant surface glycoproteins, which undergo remarkable antigenic variation, enabling persistent evasion of host adaptive immunity leading to chronic infection. \"T. brucei\" is one of only a few pathogens known to cross the blood brain barrier. There is an urgent need for the development of new drug therapies, as current treatments can have severe side effects and can prove fatal to the patient.\n\nWhilst not historically regarded as \"T. brucei\" subspecies due to their different means of transmission, clinical presentation, and loss of kinetoplast DNA, genetic analyses reveal that \"T. equiperdum\" and \"T. evansi\" are evolved from parasites very similar to \"T. b. brucei\", and are thought to be members of the \"brucei\" clade.\n\nThe parasite was discovered in 1894 by Sir David Bruce, after whom the scientific name was given in 1899.\n\n\"T. brucei\" comprises a species complex that includes:\n\n\"T. brucei\" is a typical unicellular eukaryotic cell, and measures 8 to 50 μm in length. It has an elongated body having a streamlined and tapered shape. Its cell membrane (called pellicle) encloses the cell organelles, including the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and ribosomes. In addition, there is an unusual organelle called the kinetoplast, which is made up of numerous circular DNA (mitochondrial DNA) and functions as a single large mitochondrion. The kinetoplast lies near the basal body with which it is indistinguishable under microscope. From the basal body arises a single flagellum that run towards the anterior end. Along the body surface, the flagellum is attached to the cell membrane forming an undulating membrane. Only the tip of the flagellum is free at the anterior end. The cell surface of the bloodstream form features a dense coat of variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) which is replaced by an equally dense coat of procyclins when the parasite differentiates into the procylic in the tsetse fly midgut.\nTrypanosomatids show several different classes of cellular organisation of which two are adopted by \"Trypanosoma brucei\" at different stages of the life cycle:\n\nThese names are derived from the Greek \"mastig-\" meaning whip, referring to the trypanosome's whip-like flagellum. The trypanosome flagellum has two main structures. It is made up of a typical flagellar axoneme, which lies parallel to the paraflagellar rod, a lattice structure of proteins unique to the kinetoplastida, euglenoids and dinoflagellates.\n\nThe microtubules of the flagellar axoneme lie in the normal 9+2 arrangement, orientated with the + at the anterior end and the - in the basal body. The cytoskeletal structure extends from the basal body to the kinetoplast. The flagellum is bound to the cytoskeleton of the main cell body by four specialised microtubules, which run parallel and in the same direction to the flagellar tubulin.\n\nThe flagellar function is twofold — locomotion via oscillations along the attached flagellum and cell body, and attachment to the fly gut during the procyclic phase.\n\n\"T. brucei\" completes its life cycle between tsetse fly (of the genus \"Glossina\") and mammalian hosts, including humans, cattle, horses, and wild animals.\n\nInfection occurs when a vector tsetse fly bites a mammalian host. The fly injects the metacyclic trypomastigotes into the skin tissue. The trypomastigotes enter the lymphatic system and into the bloodstream. The initial trypomastigotes are short and stumpy. Once inside the bloodstream, they grow into long and slender forms. Then, they multiply by binary fission. The daughter cells then become short and stumpy again. The long slender forms are able to penetrate the blood vessel endothelium and invade extravascular tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS).\nSometimes, wild animals can be infected by the tsetse fly and they act as reservoirs. In these animals, they do not produce the disease, but the live parasite can be transmitted back to the normal hosts.\n\nThe short and stumpy trypomastigotes are taken up by tsetse fly during blood meal. The trypomastigotes enter the midgut of the fly where they become procyclic trypomastigotes. These rapidly divide to become epimastigotes. The epimastigotes migrate from the gut via the proventriculus to the salivary glands where they get attached to the salivary gland epithelium. In the salivary glands, some parasites detach and undergo transformation into short and stumpy trypomastigotes. These become the infective metacyclic trypomastigotes. They are injected into the mammalian host along with the saliva on biting. Complete development in the fly takes about 20 days.\n\nThe reproduction of \"T. brucei\" is unusual compared to most eukaryotes. The nuclear membrane remains intact and the chromosomes do not condense during mitosis. The basal body, unlike the centrosome of most eukaryotic cells, does not play a role in the organisation of the spindle and instead is involved in division of the kinetoplast. The events of reproduction are:\n\nIn the 1980s, DNA analyses of the developmental stages of \"T. brucei\" started to indicate that the trypomastigote in the tsetse fly undergoes meiosis, i.e. a sexual reproduction stage. But it is not always necessary for a complete life cycle. The existence of meiosis-specific proteins was reported in 2011. The haploid gametes (daughter cells produced after meiosis) were discovered in 2014. The haploid trypomastigote-like gametes can interact with each other via their flagella and undergo cell fusion (the process is called syngamy). Thus, in addition to binary fission, \"T. brucei\" can multiply by sexual reproduction. Trypanosomes belong to the supergroup Excavata and are one of the earliest diverging lineages among eukaryotes. The discovery of sexual reproduction in \"T. brucei\" supports the hypothesis that meiosis and sexual reproduction are ancestral and ubiquitous features of eukaryotes.\n\nThe insect vectors for \"T. brucei\" are different species of tsetse fly (genus \"Glossina\"). The major vectors of \"T. b. gambiense\", causing West African sleeping sickness, are \"G. palpapalis\", \"G. tachinoides\", and \"G. fuscipes\". While the principal vectors of \"T. b. rhodesiense\", causing East African sleeping sickness, are \"G. morsitans\", \"G. pallidipes\", and \"G. Swynnertoni\". Animal trypanosomiasis is transmitted by a dozen species of \"Glossina\".\n\nIn later stages of a \"T. brucei\" infection of a mammalian host the parasite may migrate from the bloodstream to also infect the lymph and cerebrospinal fluids. It is under this tissue invasion that the parasites produce the sleeping sickness.\n\nIn addition to the major form of transmission via the tsetse fly \"T. brucei\", may be transferred between mammals via bodily fluid exchange, such as by blood transfusion or sexual contact, although this is thought to be rare.\n\n\"T. brucei\" is found where the tsetse fly vectors are prevalent. It is present in tropical and subtropical areas of Africa north of the equator, covering East, Central and West Africa. Hence, the equatorial region of Africa is called the \"sleeping sickness\" belt. However, the specific type of the trypanosome differs according to geography. \"T. b. rhodesiense\" is found primarily in East Africa (Botswana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe), while \"T. b. gambiense\" is found in Central and West Africa.\n\n\"Trypanosoma brucei gambiense\" evolved from a single progenitor ~10,000 years ago. It is evolving asexually and its genome shows the Meselson effect.\n\nThere are two subpopulations of \"T. b. gambiense\" that possesses two distinct groups that differ in genotype and phenotype. Group 2 is more akin to \"T. b. brucei\" than group 1 \"T. b. gambiense\".\n\nAll \"T. b. gambiense\" are resistant to killing by a serum component — trypanosome lytic factor (TLF) of which there are two types: TLF-1 and TLF-2. Group 1 \"T. b. gambiense\" parasites avoid uptake of the TLF particles while those of group 2 are able to either neutralize or compensate for the effects of TLF.\n\nIn contrast \"T. b. rhodesiense\" is dependent upon the expression of a serum resistance associated (SRA) gene. This gene is not found in \"T. b. gambiense\".\n\nThe genome of \"T. brucei\" is made up of:\nMost genes are held on the large chromosomes, with the minichromosomes carrying only \"VSG\" genes. The genome has been sequenced and is available on GeneDB.\n\nThe mitochondrial genome is found condensed into the kinetoplast, an unusual feature unique to the kinetoplastid protozoans. The kinetoplast and the basal body of the flagellum are strongly associated via a cytoskeletal structure.\n\nIn 1993, a new base, beta-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil (base J), was identified in the nuclear DNA of \"T. brucei.\"\n\nThe surface of the trypanosome is covered by a dense coat of ~5 x 10 molecules of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). This coat enables an infecting \"T. brucei\" population to persistently evade the host's immune system, allowing chronic infection. VSG is highly immunogenic, and an immune response raised against a specific VSG coat rapidly kills trypanosomes expressing this variant. Antibody-mediated trypanosome killing can also be observed in vitro by a complement-mediated lysis assay. However, with each cell division there is a possibility that one or both of the progeny will switch expression to change the VSG that is being expressed. The frequency of VSG switching has been measured to be approximately 0.1% per division. As \"T. brucei\" populations can peak at a size of 10 within a host this rapid rate of switching ensures that the parasite population is typically highly diverse. Because host immunity against a specific VSG does not develop immediately, some parasites will have switched to an antigenically-distinct VSG variant, and can go on to multiply and continue the infection. The clinical effect of this cycle is successive 'waves' of parasitemia (trypanosomes in the blood).\n\nExpression of \"VSG\" genes occurs through a number of mechanisms yet to be fully understood. The expressed VSG can be switched either by activating a different expression site (and thus changing to express the \"VSG\" in that site), or by changing the \"VSG\" gene in the active site to a different variant. The genome contains many hundreds if not thousands of \"VSG\" genes, both on minichromosomes and in repeated sections ('arrays') in the interior of the chromosomes. These are transcriptionally silent, typically with omitted sections or premature stop codons, but are important in the evolution of new VSG genes. It is estimated up to 10% of the \"T. brucei\" genome may be made up of VSG genes or pseudogenes. It is thought that any of these genes can be moved into the active site by recombination for expression. VSG silencing is largely due to the effects of histone variants H3.V and H4.V. These histones cause changes in the tree-dimensional structure of the T. Brucei genome that results in a lack of expression. VSG genes are typically located in the subtelomeric reigons of the chromosomes, which makes it easier for them to be silenced when they are not being used.\n\n\"Trypanosoma brucei brucei\" (as well as related species \"T. equiperdum\" and \"T. evansi\") is not human infective because it is susceptible to innate immune system 'trypanolytic' factors present in the serum of some primates, including humans. These trypanolytic factors have been identified as two serum complexes designated trypanolytic factors (TLF-1 and -2) both of which contain haptoglobin related protein (HPR) and apolipoprotein LI (ApoL1). TLF-1 is a member of the high density lipoprotein family of particles while TLF-2 is a related high molecular weight serum protein binding complex. The protein components of TLF-1 are haptoglobin related protein (HPR), apolipoprotein L-1 (apoL-1) and apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA-1). These three proteins are colocalized within spherical particles containing phospholipids and cholesterol. The protein components of TLF-2 include IgM and apolipoprotein A-I.\n\nTrypanolytic factors are found only in a few species, including humans, gorillas, mandrills, baboons and sooty mangabeys. This appears to be because haptoglobin-related protein and apolipoprotein L-1 are unique to primates. This suggests these genes originated in the primate genome -.\n\nHuman infective subspecies \"T. b. gambiense\" and \"T. b. rhodesiense\" have evolved mechanisms of resisting the trypanolytic factors, described below.\n\nApoL1 is a member of a six gene family, ApoL1-6, that have arisen by tandem duplication. These proteins are normally involved in host apoptosis or autophagic death and possess a Bcl-2 homology domain 3. ApoL1 has been identified as the toxic component involved in trypanolysis. ApoLs have been subject to recent selective evolution possibly related to resistance to pathogens\n\nThe gene encoding ApoL1 is found on the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q12.3). Variants of this gene, termed G1 and G2, provide protection against \"T. b. rhodesiense\". These benefits are not without their downside as a specific ApoL1 glomeropathy has been identified. This glomeropathy may help to explain the greater prevalence of hypertension in African populations.\n\nThe gene encodes a protein of 383 residues, including a typical signal peptide of 12 amino acids. The plasma protein is a single chain polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 42 kiloDaltons. ApoL1 has a membrane pore forming domain functionally similar to that of bacterial colicins. This domain is flanked by the membrane addressing domain and both these domains are required for parasite killing.\n\nWithin the kidney, ApoL1 is found in the podocytes in the glomeruli, the proximal tubular epithelium and the arteriolar endothelium. It has a high affinity for phosphatidic acid and cardiolipin and can be induced by interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha.\n\nHpr is 91% identical to haptoglobin (Hp), an abundant acute phase serum protein, which possesses a high affinity for hemoglobin (Hb). When Hb is released from erythrocytes undergoing intravascular hemolysis Hp forms a complex with the Hb and these are removed from the circulation by the CD163 scavenger receptor. In contrast to Hp–Hb, the Hpr–Hb complex does not bind CD163 and the Hpr serum concentration appears to be unaffected by hemolysis.\n\nThe association HPR with hemoglobin allows TLF-1 binding and uptake via the trypanosome haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor (TbHpHbR). TLF-2 enters trypanosomes independently of TbHpHbR. TLF-1 uptake is enhanced in the low levels of haptoglobin which competes with haptoglobin related protein to bind free hemoglobin in the serum. However the complete absence of haptoglobin is associated with a decreased killing rate by serum.\n\nThe trypanosome haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor is an elongated three a-helical bundle with a small membrane distal head. This protein extends above the variant surface glycoprotein layer that surrounds the parasite.\n\nThe first step in the killing mechanism is the binding of TLF to high affinity receptors—the haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptors—that are located in the flagellar pocket of the parasite. The bound TLF is endocytosed via coated vesicles and then trafficked to the parasite lysosomes. ApoL1 is the main lethal factor in the TLFs and kills trypanosomes after insertion into endosomal / lysosomal membranes. After ingestion by the parasite, the TLF-1 particle is trafficked to the lysosome wherein Apo1 is activated by a pH mediated conformational change. After fusion with the lysosome the pH drops from ~7 to ~5. This induces a conformational change in the ApoL1 membrane addressing domain which in turn causes a salt bridge linked hinge to open. This releases ApoL1 from the HDL particle to insert in the lysosomal membrane. The ApoL1 protein then creates anionic pores in the membrane which leads to depolarization of the membrane, a continuous influx of chloride and subsequent osmotic swelling of the lysosome. This influx in its turn leads to rupture of the lysosome and the subsequent death of the parasite.\n\n\"Trypanosoma brucei gambiense\" causes 97% of human cases of sleeping sickness. Resistance to ApoL1 is principally mediated by the hydrophobic ß-sheet of the \"T. b. gambiense\" specific glycoprotein. Other factors involved in resistance appear to be a change in the cysteine protease activity and TbHpHbR inactivation due to a leucine to serine substitution (L210S) at codon 210. This is due to a thymidine to cytosine mutation at the second codon position.\n\nThese mutations may have evolved due to the coexistence of malaria where this parasite is found. Haptoglobin levels are low in malaria because of the hemolysis that occurs with the release of the merozoites into the blood. The rupture of the erythrocytes results in the release of free haem into the blood where it is bound by haptoglobin. The haem is then removed along with the bound haptoglobin from the blood by the reticuloendothelial system.\n\n\"Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense\" relies on a different mechanism of resistance: the serum resistance associated protein (SRA). The SRA gene is a truncated version of the major and variable surface antigen of the parasite, the variant surface glycoprotein. It has a low sequence homology with the VSGc (<25%). SRA is an expression site associated gene in \"T. b. rhodesiense\" and is located upstream of the VSGs in the active telomeric expression site. The protein is largely localized to small cytoplasmic vesicles between the flagellar pocket and the nucleus. In \"T. b. rhodesiense\" the TLF is directed to SRA containing endosomes while some dispute remain on its presence in the lysosome. SRA binds to ApoL1 using a coiled–coiled interaction at the ApoL1 SRA interacting domain while within the trypanosome lysosome. This interaction prevents the release of the ApoL1 protein and the subsequent lysis of the lysosome and death of the parasite.\n\nBaboons are known to be resistant to \"Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense\". The baboon version of the ApoL1 gene differs from the human gene in a number of respects including two critical lysines near the C terminus that are necessary and sufficient to prevent baboon ApoL1 binding to SRA. Experimental mutations allowing ApoL1 to be protected from neutralization by SRA have been shown capable of conferring trypanolytic activity on \"T. b. rhodesiense\". These mutations resemble those found in baboons, but also resemble natural mutations conferring protection of humans against \"T. b. rhodesiense\" which are linked to kidney disease.\n\n\n"}

It excludes indirect car-related fatalities.\n\nFor 2016 specifically, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) data shows 37,461 people were killed in 34,436 motor vehicle crashes, an average of 102 per day. \n\nIn 2010, there were an estimated 5,419,000 crashes, 30,296 deadly, killing 32,999, and injuring 2,239,000. About 2,000 children under 16 die every year in traffic collisions. Records indicate that there were 3,613,732 motor vehicle fatalities in the United States from 1899 to 2013. \n\nAlthough the number of deaths, and deaths relative to the total US population, declined over most of the previous two decades, the trend reversed in 2015 and continued to move upward in 2016. From 1979 to 2005, the number of deaths per year decreased 14.97% while the number of deaths per capita decreased by 35.46%. The 32,479 traffic fatalities in 2011 were the lowest in 62 years, since 1949. US motor death statistics reported by government only include those on public roads, and do not include parking lots, driveways, and private roads.\n\nThe following table summarizes the number of people killed and injured in fatal collisions by month in 2010. The table does not include injuries resulting from incidents in which no fatalities occurred. \n\nThese fatalities do not include those also attributable to transportation-linked pollution nor to energy production for the use of the transportation. They are also only human fatalities, while animals are also significantly affected, with tens of millions of deaths. Another factor not included in this tally is that attributable to traffic noise, which could be millions as a contributory factor and is likely to be tens of thousands as a direct consequence.\n\nPedestrian deaths are included in above totals. These deaths had been falling from 6,482 in 1990 to 4,109 in 2009. The number began rising in 2010, and exceeded 6,000 by 2018. Proportionately, pedestrians comprised 12% of all traffic deaths in 2008, rising to 16% in 2017. A report by the Governors Highway Safety Association said most of the increases in deaths occurred at night, as well as suggesting several other potential explanations for the rise, including changes in economics, such as fuel prices, and changes in weather and demographics, along with increases in population, vehicle miles traveled, and time spent walking. The shift away from passenger cars to light duty trucks, particularity the popularity of SUVs, also coincided with the increase, and light truck impacts cause worse pedestrian injuries. An increase in driver smartphone distraction is also a possible factor, with the number of phones in use increasing by a factor of five from 2010 to 2017. Some 6,227 pedestrians were killed in traffic in 2018 in the US. Around 3000 additional people are killed each year in parking lots, driveways, or private roads, many of whom are pedestrians who are not counted in these fatality statistics.\n\n\n"}

Wet wipes are used for cleaning purposes like personal hygiene and household cleaning.\n\nAmerican Arthur Julius is seen as the inventor of the wet wipes. Julius worked in the cosmetics industry and in 1957, adjusted a soap portioning machine, putting it in a loft in Manhattan. Julius trademarked the name Wet-Nap in 1958, a name for the product that is still being used. After fine tuning his new hand-cleaning aid together with a mechanic, he unveiled his invention at the 1960 National Restaurant Show in Chicago and in 1963 started selling Wet-Nap products to Colonel Harland Sanders to be distributed to customers of Kentucky Fried Chicken.\n\nNinety percent of wet wipes on the market are produced from nonwoven fabrics made of polyester or polypropylene.\n\nThe material is moistened with water or other liquids (e.g., isopropyl alcohol) depending on the applications. The material may be treated with softeners, lotions, or perfume to adjust the tactile and olfactory properties. Preservatives such as methylisothiazolinone are used to prevent bacterial or fungal growth in the package. The finished wet wipes are folded and put in pocket size package or a box dispenser.\n\nWet wipes can serve a number of personal and household purposes. Although marketed primarily for wiping infants' bottoms in diaper changing, it is not uncommon for consumers to also use the product to clean floors, toilet seats, and other surfaces around the home. Parents also use wet wipes, or as they are called for baby care, baby wipes, for wiping up baby vomit and to clean babies' hands and faces. \n\nBaby wipes are wet wipes used to cleanse the sensitive skin of infants. These are saturated with solutions anywhere from gentle cleansing ingredients to alcohol-based \"cleaners\". Baby wipes are typically different pack counts (ranging up to 80 or more sheets per pack), and come with dispensing mechanisms. The origin of baby wipes most likely came in the mid-1950s as more people were travelling and needed a way to clean up on the go. One of the first companies to produce these was a company called Nice-Pak. They made napkin sized paper cloth saturated with a scented skin cleanser. Rockline Industries of Sheboygan, Wisconsin (which has a large part of the private label wipe market in several segments) went on to be the first to innovate the first baby wipe refill pack and pop-up packs which have become common in the marketplace.\n\nThe first wet-wipe products specifically marketed as baby wipes, such as Kimberly-Clark's Huggies wipes and Procter & Gamble's Pampers wipes, appeared on the market in 1990. As the technology to produce wipes matured and became more affordable, smaller brands began to appear. By the 1990s, most super stores like Kmart and Wal-Mart had their own private label brand of wipes made by other manufacturers. After this period there was a boom in the industry and many local brands started manufacturing because of low entry barriers.\n\nMany green-minded parents, or those looking to save extra money, use washable baby wipes, typically small squares of material (such as cotton, bamboo or fleece) that can be pre-soaked ready to use, or wet as required. The cloths are wetted with either just water, commercial wipe solution or homemade solutions. Some parents prefer to use only water or their own homemade solutions as they can more directly control the ingredients used on the child’s skin. Some parents feel that cloth wipes are more effective at removing solids from the skin than commercial one-use wipes because of their textured nature.\n\nWet wipes are often included as part of a standard sealed cutlery package offered in restaurants or along with airline meals.\n\nWet wipes began to be marketed as a luxury alternative to toilet paper by 2005 by companies such as Kimberly-Clark and Procter & Gamble. They are dispensed in the toilets of restaurants, service stations, doctors' offices, and other places with public use.\n\nWet wipes have also found a use among visitors to outdoor music festivals, particularly those who camp, as an alternative to communal showers. The wet wipes are a preferable option to the communal facilities, for which there are long queues.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, wet wipes are often sold out of refrigerators to give the wipes a refreshingly cool effect.\n\nCleansing pads are fiber sponges which have been previously soaked with water, alcohol and other active ingredients for a specific intended use. They are ready to use hygiene products and they are simple and convenient solutions to dispose of dirt or other undesirable elements.\n\nThere are different type of cleansing pads offered by the beauty industry: make-up removing pads, anti-spot treatments and anti-acne pads that usually contain salicylic acid, vitamins, menthol and other treatments).\n\nCleansing pads for preventing infection are usually saturated with alcohol and bundled in sterile packages. Hands and instruments may be disinfected with these pads while treating wounds. Disinfecting cleansing pads are often included in first aid kits for this purpose. Since the outbreak of H1N1 sales of individual impregnated wet wipes and gels in sachets and flowpacks have dramatically increased in the UK following the Government's advice to keep hands and surfaces clean to prevent the spread of germs.\n\nPre-impregnated industrial-strength cleaning wipes with powerful cleaning fluid that cuts through the dirt as the high performance fabric absorbs the residue. Industrial wipes has the ability to clean a vast range of though substances from hands, tools and surfaces, including: grime, grease, oil- and water-based paints and coatings, adhesives, silicone and acrylic sealants, poly foam, epoxy, oil, tar and more.\n\nThere are pain relief pads sopping with alcohol and benzocaine. These pads are good for treating minor scrapes, burns, and insect bites. They disinfect the injury and also ease pain and itching.\n\nToday one can find wet wipes for pet care, for example eye, ear, or dental cleansing pads (with boric acid, potassium chloride, zinc sulfate, sodium borate) for dogs, cats, horses, and birds.\n\nMedical wet wipes are available for various applications. These include alcohol wet wipes, chlorhexidine wipes (for disinfection of surfaces and noninvasive medical devices) and sporicidal wipes. Medical wipes can be used to prevent the spread of pathogens such as norovirus and \"Clostridium difficile\".\n\nWater management companies ask people not to flush wet wipes down toilets, as their failure to break apart or dissolve in water can cause sewer blockages known as fatbergs.\n\nSince the mid-2000s, wet wipes such as baby wipes have become more common for use as an alternative to toilet paper in affluent countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. This usage has in some cases been encouraged by manufacturers, who have labelled some wet wipe brands as \"flushable\". Wet wipes, when flushed down the toilet, have been reported to clog internal plumbing, septic systems and public sewer systems. The tendency for fat and wet wipes to cling together allegedly encourages the growth of the problematic obstructions in sewers known as \"fatbergs\". In addition, some brands of wipes contain alcohol, which can kill the bacteria and enzymes responsible for breaking down solid waste in septic tanks. In the late 2010s, other alternatives such as gel wipe had also come on to the market. \n\nIn 2014 a class action suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio against Target Corporation, and Nice-Pak Products Inc. on behalf of consumers in Ohio who purchased Target-brand flushable wipes. The lawsuit alleged the retailer misled consumers by marking the packaging on its Up & Up brand wipes as flushable and safe for sewer and septic systems. The lawsuit also alleged that the products were a public health hazard because they clogged pumps at municipal waste-treatment facilities. Target and Nice-Pak agreed to settle the case in 2018.\n\nIn 2015, the city of Wyoming, Minnesota, launched a class action suit against six companies, including Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark, and Nice-Pak, alleging they were fraudulently promoting their products as \"flushable\". The city dropped the lawsuit in 2018 after concluding that the city had not experienced damage to its sewer systems or a rise in maintenance costs. Upon announcement of the withdrawal of the suit, an industry trade group representing the manufacturers of the wipes released a statement that disputed the claims that the products are harmful to sewer systems.\nIn 2016, several British water companies including Wessex Water began a campaign advising consumers not to flush wet wipes down toilets because of added maintenance costs.\n\nIn 2019, the industry body Water UK announced a new standard for flushable wet wipes. Wipes will need to pass rigorous testing in order to gain a new and approved \"Fine to Flush\" logo. As of January 2019, only one product had been confirmed to meet the standard, although there were about seven others in the process of being tested.\n\n"}

It was released with an accompanying DVD to commemorate his first set of concerts in almost ten years.\n\nUsing most of the musicians that appeared on \"Driving Rain\", McCartney assembled a new live act composed of Rusty Anderson and Brian Ray on guitar, Abe Laboriel Jr. on drums and keyboardist Paul Wickens, who had been on McCartney's previous two tours, in 1989–90 and 1993. As of 2019, these four musicians are still members of McCartney's touring band.\n\nAlthough McCartney was promoting \"Driving Rain\", the majority of the tour setlist celebrated his past, by featuring a sampling of his solo work with and without Wings, and a substantial number of the hits he had written while a member of the Beatles. On \"Back in the U.S.\", McCartney reversed the songwriting credits for 19 Lennon–McCartney compositions to read \"Paul McCartney and John Lennon\" – a move that author Howard Sounes describes as the live album's \"chief point of interest\". This gesture was a further attempt by McCartney to establish his legacy following Lennon's death in 1980, having been vetoed from adopting the McCartney–Lennon credit during the \"Beatles Anthology\" project in 1995 by his former bandmates George Harrison and Ringo Starr.\n\nThe revised credits on \"Back in the U.S.\" incensed Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, who threatened to take legal action, while Starr said he found McCartney's actions \"underhanded\". Some commentators observed that McCartney had similarly credited his Beatles songs to \"McCartney–Lennon\" on the 1976 live album \"Wings over America\" and that Lennon had never publicly objected to the reversal; in addition, the compositions in question were written with little or no input from Lennon. When compiling \"Back in the U.S.\", McCartney had decided to act in response to Ono's dropping of his co-writer's credit for \"Give Peace a Chance\", on the 1997 compilation \"\". Despite their differences on this issue, McCartney and Starr united on stage for the Harrison tribute concert shortly after the release of the live album.\n\n\"Back in the U.S.\" was issued in November 2002 as an exclusive North American and Japanese release (an international edition with a slight track listing change, entitled \"Back in the World\", was released a few months later). \"Back in the U.S.\" sold well on export and gained sales of over 2 million globally. The album debuted at number 8 on the US charts with sales of 224,000 copies, marking his highest sales during a single week since the introduction of Nielsen SoundScan in 1991. The album was certified double platinum in America, for shipments of over 2 million units. It entered the top five on the Japanese chart, making McCartney one of the Western artists with the most top-ten albums in that country. Its tie-in DVD proved to be a strong seller as well. \"Back in the U.S.\" was the first Paul McCartney album not released on vinyl.\n\nAll songs written by Paul McCartney and John Lennon, except where noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Serving in the Army for Korean War duty, Dawson played with the Army Dance Band while stationed at Fort Dix from 1951–1953. During his tenure, Alan explored the post-bop era by performing with pianist Sabby Lewis. After being released from the Army, Alan toured Europe with Lionel Hampton.\n\nDawson is best remembered as an early teacher of Tony Williams, and Sawyer Brown drummer, Joseph Smyth. Other former students include: Terri Lyne Carrington,\nJulian Vaughn, Vinnie Colaiuta, Steve Smith, Kenwood Dennard, Gerry Hemingway, Jeff Sipe, Billy Kilson, and many others. He began teaching at Berklee College of Music in 1957. Dawson suffered a ruptured disc in 1975 which led to him halting his touring schedule, to leave Berklee and limit his teaching to his home in Lexington, Massachusetts.\n\nHis teaching style emphasized the music as a whole rather than concentrate on percussion alone. He stressed the importance of learning the melody and structure of the tune to better fulfill the role of accompaniment. For this purpose, he had students play over standards while also singing the melody out loud. He constantly strived for balance between musical ideas and strict technique. He was big on rudiments and wrote extensive exercises intended to be practiced with brushes. He believed using brushes with his \"Rudimental Ritual\" would reduce stick rebound allowing the sense of \"picking up\" the sticks. While teaching, Alan also maintained a prolific performing and recording career.\n\nDawson was the house drummer for Lennie's on the Turnpike in Peabody, Massachusetts from 1963 through to 1970. This gig allowed him to perform with a diverse group of jazz artists. Around this time, Dawson was Boston's premier jazz drummer for local acts as well as bigger name touring artists.\n\nThroughout the 1960s Dawson recorded almost exclusively with saxophonist Booker Ervin on Prestige Records. In 1968 Dawson replaced Joe Morello in the Dave Brubeck Quartet and continued until 1972. His performance credits also included stints with Bill Evans, Sonny Rollins, Jaki Byard, Booker Ervin, Sonny Stitt, Dexter Gordon, Lee Konitz, Quincy Jones, Charles Mingus, Tal Farlow and many other top jazz artists.\n\nDawson's teaching methods have been passed on by many of his former students.

In that essay, which she has updated twice for editions of the anthology \"Transforming a Rape Culture\", she argues that feminist theory has taken a dogmatic approach to nonviolence and that women's self-defense, violent feminist activism, and the encouragement of positive media portrayals of violent women (such as in \"Kill Bill\" or \"\") have not been given the serious consideration they should receive and that their dismissal from mainstream feminism, while it may ultimately be desirable, has not been based on a properly thorough analysis.

{"id": "2198728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198728", "title": "Surra", "text": "Surra\n\nSurra (from the Marathi \"sūra\", meaning the sound of heavy breathing through nostrils, of imitative origin) is a disease of vertebrate animals. The disease is caused by protozoan trypanosomes, specifically \"Trypanosoma evansi\", of several species which infect the blood of the vertebrate host, causing fever, weakness, and lethargy which lead to weight loss and anemia. In some animals the disease is fatal unless treated.\n\nAn acute form of the disease, which is generally fatal unless treated, occurs in horses, donkeys, mules, cattle, buffalo, deer, camels, llamas, dogs, and cats. This form is caused by \"Trypanosoma evansi\" (Steel 1885) (Balbiani 1888), and is transmitted by horse-flies, and also by the vampire bat, \"Desmodus rotundus\", in South-America. This form occurs in South America, Northern Africa, and the Middle East. This was the first form of pathogenic trypanosome discovered and was first described by Griffith Evans in 1880 while he was working in India.\n\nA chronic form of the disease, which is milder but persistent, occurs in pigs, sheep, and goats. This form is caused by \"Trypanosoma suis\" and is transmitted by tsetse. This form occurs in Africa.\n\nSurra is also known from other countries; an unspecified form is locally common in Mindanao, in the Philippines.\n\n\"Trypanosoma evansi\", although monomorphic in most cases, can be pleomorphic in some strains. They are characterized by a long free flagellum with a narrow drawn out posterior. Kinetoplast and dyskinetoplastic forms appear. Kinetoplast is either terminal or subterminal.\n\nTransferred by species of \"Tabanus\" flies, \"Trypanosoma evansi\" development does not take place in the actual vector. In order for the transmission to be successful, trypanosomes need to survive in the gut of the flies and be regurgitated during subsequent feeding. Since tabanidae are most abundant during rainy and post rainy seasons, that is when most outbreaks of Surra occur. \n\nIn order for the transfer of the disease from the flies to the animals, interruption of feeding habits needs to occur. This direct transmission technique involves them cutting the skin with their mouths, then lapping up the blood along with connective tissue fluid. This means a good indicator of disease would be looking at trypanosome density in capillary blood and connective tissue. After transferring the infectious organisms to the host species, the flies leave to rest and during that time transmission was successful only in some cases. Because the trypanosomes remain in the food canal of the flies for 4–8 hours depending on the species, the flies can feed off of one animal's blood more than one time, thus increasing the chance of successful transmission. \n\nAlthough the most common method of transferring trypanosomes to other species is through tabanus flies, there are other insects that can also transmit this disease to livestock. These blood sucking insects are Stomoxys, Haematobia (also known as Lyperosia), Haematopota, and Ornithordorus.\n\nOther methods of transmission still being studied are looking at passing T.evansi thorough iatrogenic transmission. Evidence has been seen of transmission through eating infected meat and also through vampire bats in geographical areas where they are found.\n\nThe degree of pathogenicity depends on what species the host is, the virulence of the \"Trypanosoma evansi\" strain, and the dose received by the host. Many species such as dogs, horses and rats, have been shown to have immunological reactions to the infection, such as anemia due to decrease in erythrocytes and hemoglobin. Although not fully understood at this point in time, some theories believe that the erythrocytes could acquire trypaonosomal antigen, resulting in a negative immunological reaction.\n\nAnimals that have been infected show loss of appetite, weight loss, anaemia, odema, fever, salivations, lacrimation, and abortion. The proteases that are released during infection of T.evansi might degrade the host tissue proteins and are a huge force in the pathogenesis. That is why scientists are looking at immune targeting of these proteases to protect the infected host.\n\nSome conventional parasitological techniques (CPT) such as wet blood film, and stained blood smears are used because so far, the best identifier is looking at the blood of the potentially infected host. Other tissues can be looked at, but the gold standard is identifying trypanosomes in the blood. Before the infection becomes severe, it is difficult to catch as many times these cryptic infections are undetectable by direct microscopy. Since CPT is not very sensitive, it cannot be used as a sole method of diagnosis.\n\nThe Haematocrit Centrifugation Technique (HCT) is a much better alternative. Using HCT trypanosomes can be detected in the blood even in field conditions. Buffy coat can be used to increase detection. Detection with this method is approx 85 trypanosomes per millilitre.\n\nRather than using live animals as test subjects, Canada used serological tests such as complement fixation tests to detect trypanosomes, and have been very successful. Other tests used look at detecting antibodies generated by the host species against T.evansi antigens. This is done using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) method. Now polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA probes are being used to detect Surra in animals.\n\nThe main methods of controlling surra has been drug chemotherapy, and chemoprophylaxis in animals.\n\nIn South America, surra was known by the names \"mal de caderas\" (hip illness), \"murrina,\" \"peste boba,\" \"derrengadera,\" and Panama horse disease. \"Mal de caderas\" was sometimes used for rabies as well, but most commonly refers to surra. \"Mal de caderas\" spread from Brazil to eastern Bolivia in the 1840s. Because so many horses sickened and died from surra, people in eastern Bolivia from this point on were occasionally known to ride oxen, which became known as \"bueyes caballos\" (horse oxen) or \"bueyes de cabalgadura\" (riding oxen).\n\nPage on Surra Retrieved on 29 August 2005.\n"}
{"id": "2198731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198731", "title": "Latch", "text": "Latch\n\nA latch or catch (called sneck in Northern England and Scotland) is a type of mechanical fastener that joins two (or more) objects or surfaces while allowing for their regular separation. A latch typically engages another piece of hardware on the other mounting surface. Depending upon the type and design of the latch, this engaged bit of hardware may be known as a \"keeper\" or \"strike\".\n\nA latch is not the same as the locking mechanism of a door or window, although often they are found together in the same product.\n\nLatches range in complexity from flexible one-piece flat springs of metal or plastic, such as are used to keep blow molded plastic power tool cases closed, to multi-point cammed latches used to keep large doors closed.\n\nA single-throw bolt. The bolt can be engaged in its strike plate only after the door is closed. The locking mechanism typically prevents the bolt from being retracted by force.\n\n\nA slam latch uses a spring and is activated by the shutting or slamming of a door. Like all latches, a slam latch is a mechanism to hold a door closed. The slam latch derives its name from its ability to slam doors and drawers shut without damaging the latch. A slam latch is rugged and ideal for industrial, agricultural and construction applications.\n\nA cam lock is a type of latch consisting of a \"base\" and a \"cam\". The base is where the key or tool is used to rotate the cam, which is what does the latching. Cams can be straight or offset; offset cams are reversible. Commonly found on garage cabinets, file cabinets, tool chests, and other locations where privacy and security is needed.\nA Norfolk latch is a type of latch incorporating a simple thumb-actuated lever and commonly used to hold wooden gates and doors closed. In a Norfolk latch, the handle is fitted to a backplate independently of the thumb piece. Introduced around 1800–1820, Norfolk latches, originating in the English county of the same name, differ from the older Suffolk latch, which lacked a back plate to which the thumbpiece is attached.\n\nA Suffolk latch is a type of latch incorporating a simple thumb-actuated lever and commonly used to hold wooden gates and doors closed.\n\nThe Suffolk latch originated in the English county of Suffolk in the 16th century and stayed in common use until the 19th century. They have recently come back into favour, particularly on garden gates and sheds. They were common from the 17th century to around 1825, and their lack of a back plate made them different from the later, and neighbouring Norfolk latch (introduced 1800–1820). Both the Suffolk latch and Norfolk latch are thought to have been named by architectural draughtsman William Twopenny (1797-1873). Many of these plates found their way into America and other parts of the world.\n\nA crossbar, sometimes called a bolt, is a primitive fastener consisting simply of a post barring a door.\n\nCrossbars were historically common, simple fasteners consisting simply of a plank or beam mounted to one side of a door by a set of cleats. The board could be slid past the frame to block the door. Alternatively, the bar can be a separate piece that is placed into open cleats or hooks, extending across the frame on both sides. The effect of this device is essentially the opposite of the crash bar in that its operation is to permit the door to be opened inward rather than outward. On a set of double doors, the same principle works, but needn't extend past the frame. The bar simply extends into another set of cleats on the other door such as to interfere with the door opening.\n\nA cabin hook is a hooked bar that engages into a staple. The bar is usually attached permanently to a ring or staple that is fixed with screws or nails to woodwork or a wall at the same level as the eye screw. The eye screw is usually screwed into the adjacent wall or onto the door itself. Used to hold a cupboard, door or gate open or shut.\n\nA cabin hook is used in many situations to hold a door open, like on ships to prevent doors from swinging and banging against other woodwork as the ship moves due to wave action. This usage spread also to other domains, where a door was required to be held open or a self-closing device is used to close the door.\n\nMany buildings are built with fire-resistant doors to separate different parts of buildings and to allow people to be protected from fire and smoke. When using a cabin hook in such a situation, one should keep in mind that a fire-resistant door is an expensive and heavy item, and it only works as a fire door if it is always closed. To hold an often heavy fire door open simply, (magnetic) door holders are used that release when a building's fire alarm system is activated. As cabin hooks must be activated manually, they are impractical for fire doors.\nAlso named draw latch or draw catch. It has a claw or a loop that catches the strike plate (named catch plate in this case) when reaching a certain position.\n\nA pawl is a latch that will allow movement in one direction, but prevents return motion. Commonly used in combination with a ratchet wheel.\n\nA latch of some type is typically fitted to a door or window.\n\nMany types of weaponry incorporate latches with designs unique to the weapon.\n\nFirearms require specialized latches used during loading and firing of the weapon.\n\nA break-action firearm is one whose barrels are hinged and a latch is operated to release the two parts of the weapon to expose the breech and allow loading and unloading of ammunition. It is then closed and re-latched prior to firing. A separate operation may be required for the cocking and latching-open of a hammer to fire the new round. Break open actions are universal in double-barrelled shotguns, double-barrelled rifles and combination guns, and are also common in single shot rifles, pistols, and shotguns, and can also be found in flare guns, grenade launchers, air guns and some older revolver designs.\n\nSeveral latch designs have been used for loading revolvers. In a top-break revolver, the frame is hinged at the bottom front of the cylinder. The frame is in two parts, held together by a latch on the top rear of the cylinder. For a swing out cylinder, the cylinder is mounted on a pivot that is coaxial with the chambers, and the cylinder swings out and down. Some designs, such as the Ruger Super Redhawk or the Taurus Raging Bull, use a latches at the front and rear of the cylinder to provide a secure bond between cylinder and frame.\n\nTo fire a revolver, generally the hammer is first manually cocked and latched into place. The trigger, when pulled, releases the hammer, which fires the round in the chamber.\n\nVarious types of knives with folding or retractable blades rely on latches for their function. A switchblade uses an internal spring to produce the blade which is held in place by a button-activated latch. Likewise a ballistic knife uses a strong latch to restrain a powerful spring from firing the blade as a projectile until triggered by opening the latch. A gravity knife relies on a latch to hold the folding blade in an open position once released. A balisong uses a single latch to hold the folding blade both open and closed, depending on the position of the handles; by rotating 180 degrees the same latch can be used in either configuration. Balisong latches have numerous variations, including magnetic variants and some which can be opened via a spring when the handles are squeezed together.\n\nUtility knives also often use a latch to hold a folding knife both open and closed. This allows it to be locked in orientation to the handle when in use, but also safely stowed otherwise. To open a knife of this type may require significantly more force than the weapons variety as an added safety feature.\n\nCrossbows incorporate a type of latch to hold the drawn bowstring prior to firing.\n\nAutomobiles incorporate numerous special-purpose latches as components of the doors, hood/bonnet, trunk/boot door, seat belts, etc.\n\nOn passenger cars, a hood may be held down by a concealed latch. On race cars or cars with aftermarket hoods (that do not use the factory latch system) the hood may be held down by hood pins.\n\nThe term \"Nader bolt\" is a nickname for the bolt on vehicles that allows a hinged door to remain safely latched and closed. It is named after consumer rights advocate and politician Ralph Nader, who in 1965 released the book \"Unsafe at Any Speed\" which claimed that American cars were fundamentally flawed with respect to operator safety.\n\nLatches in seatbelts typically fasten the belt which constrains the occupant to the body of the car. Particularly in rear seats slightly different latches may be used for each seat in order to prevent adjacent seatbelts from being attached to the wrong point. Inertial seatbelt release is a potential circumstance where, in a collision, the seatbelt latch can unintentionally come loose leading to potential injury of the passenger. An additional risk of seatbelt latches is that in some cases the occupant may believe the latch is secure (e.g., by hearing a characteristic click) when in fact it is not.\n\nA parking pawl is a device that latches the transmission on automatic vehicles when put in park.\n\nA spring latch (in this case an over-center-latch) is used to hold the walls of a springform pan in place.\n\n"}

It has been held every two years, over a period of three or four days. From 1999 until 2009 it ran in July. In 2011, 2013 and 2016 it ran in October. In 2018, the AFOI is held on 12-15 July.\n\nThe Adelaide Festival of Ideas offers contemporary civil society the highest possible level of intellectual debate across conventional boundaries and demarcations of disciplines, agendas and cultural norms with the aim of challenging the fragmentation of public knowledge. It is not held captive to any particular ideological, political or commercial agenda.\n\nThe program is built around an extensive array of speaker presentations, interviews and panel discussions that are mostly free to the public. The high-level discussion and public debate offered by AFOI intends to be as engaging and entertaining as it is provocative and challenging. To maximise engagement, public access to activities held within the AFOI is free of charge wherever feasible, with the aim of attracting and engaging a diverse cross-section of the community as active citizens rather than paying customers. The AFOI recognises the considerable additional benefit gained from real-time, shared-space discussions of new ideas in a moderated context with a live audience.\n\nFounded by Greg Mackie, the AFOI first ran in 1999, and then every two years after that until 2013. From 1999-2009 the AFOI was produced under the auspices of the Adelaide Festival Corporation. The 2011 AFOI was auspiced by the South Australian Department of the Premier and Cabinet - Cultural Development Group, and the 2013 AFOI was produced under the auspices of The Adelaide Film Festival Corporation, all with significant baseline funding from Arts SA. However, after this funding ceased late in 2014, the AFOI was relaunched as a non-profit incorporated association in 2015 in order to present the AFOI in 2016 and annually thereafter.\n\nFrom the inaugural 1999 event, the AFOI program grew steadily from 28 sessions involving 27 speakers, to 88 sessions and 132 speakers (including session chairs) in the 2013 event. Each AFOI has an overarching theme within which the sessions are programmed. Typical themes include: \"\"Hope and Fear\"\" (2003), \"\"Pushing the Limits\"\" (2009), \"\"Planning for Uncertainty\"\" (2011), and \"\"The real value of ..\".\" (2013).\n\nEach AFOI is dedicated to a prominent South Australian who has had a significant impact on the development of ideas across a wide range of domains, be they geographical, intellectual, cultural or social. Dedicatees include Lowitja O'Donoghue (2003), Frank Fenner (2009), Barbara Hardy (2011) and Paul Davies (2013).\n\n\"12 - 15 July 2018\", featuring Robyn Archer, former president of the Australian Human Rights Commission Gillian Triggs, and Australian writer Benjamin Law.\n\n\"17 - 20 October 2013\"\n\nThe 2013 AFOI ran in conjunction with the Adelaide Film Festival. Clearly, there was an appetite for deep and civil discussion of ideas and issues that was slaked by media and political debates that run on the rocket fuel of polling and instant communication. Speakers were asked not to respond to the loudest current concerns but to think about what matters more abidingly in their fields, and to discuss ‘the real value of…’\n\nThe 2013 AFOI was dedicated to Professor Paul Davies, physicist and science communicator extraordinaire.\n\n\"7 - 9 October 2011\"\n\nThe 2011 AFOI was devoted to the proposition that we can plan with reasonable probability to shape the improbabilities that confront us as individuals or a community. We can have better debates – then, therefore, build better cities, cultures, democracies, products, and environments. We can confront the future intelligently, imperfectly – learning and adapting as we go.\n\nThe 2011 AFOI was dedicated to pioneering environmentalist, Barbara Hardy.\n\n\"9 - 12 July 2009\"\n\nThe 2009 AFOI looked at issues as diverse as the geopolitics of tolerance among nations and religions in the region and the pursuit of scientific limits in neuroscience, health and the environment. In the bicentennial year of Darwin, whose idea of evolution is the single most consequential idea in the modern world, speakers engaged the audience in discussions of the power and consequences of the ethic of exploration and expansion which shaped, and perhaps risked, the modern world.\n\nThe 2009 AFOI was dedicated to distinguished virologist, Professor Frank Fenner AC, CMG, MBE, FRS, FAA.\n\n\"5 - 9 July 2007\"\n\nThe 2007 AFOI focussed on our imagined futures and how we might get there: a future with freedom from oppression, where we can live peaceably with our neighbours, on a sustainable earth, with decent work, a long life and a first-rate health care system to tend for us when our health falters. The big question was: how do we get there? How do we bequeath a better world for our children?\n\nThe 2007 AFOI was dedicated to eminent jurist, Royal Commissioner, Elliott Johnston QC.\n\n\"7 - 10 July 2005\"\n\nIn a disconcerting age, the 2005 AFOI tested the belief that we can, and should, design our own world, with the majority of sessions explicitly exploring how we might transform ideas into action.\n\nThe 2005 AFOI was dedicated to distinguished medical researcher, Professor Basil Hetzel AC.\n\n\"10 - 13 July 2003\"\n\nThe theme for the 2003 AFOI was chosen before the September 11 attacks, before the ‘\"Tampa\"' - Children Overboard affair meant anything to us. Perhaps this was prescient, but it was also obvious, for hope and fear are always with us. The emphasis in this Festival program fell on social and emotional matters in those unsettled times, but a wider range of intellectual exploration was well represented also.\n\nThe 2003 AFOI was dedicated to indigenous leader, Lowitja O'Donoghue AC, CBE, DSG.\n\n\"12-15 July 2001\"\n\nIn 2001, what was in short supply, what was everywhere? AFOI sessions covered water, population, addiction, intoxication, reconciliation, and more...\n\nThe 2001 AFOI was dedicated to prominent lawyer and social activist, Sir Ronald Wilson AC KBE CMG QC.\n\n\"9 - 11 July 1999\"\n\nThe inaugural AFOI examined a diverse range of topics that continue to be relevant today: international relations, the changing nature of community, truth in the media, the notion of good and evil, and the potential of new technologies...\n\n"}
{"id": "2198741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198741", "title": "Pennoyer v. Neff", "text": "Pennoyer v. Neff\n\nPennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714 (1878), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court held that a court can exert personal jurisdiction over a party if that party is served with process while physically present within the state.\n\nMarcus Neff hired an attorney, John H. Mitchell, to help him with paperwork and other legal matters incidental to his efforts to obtain a land grant under the Donation Law of Oregon, an act of the United States Congress enacted on September 27, 1850 (expired December 1, 1855) which provided an incentive for the development of land in the territories of the American West by conveying parcels of land to be used for further development. Neff was ultimately successful in procuring property on the ancestral homeland of the Multnomah Indian tribe in Multnomah County, Oregon. \n\nThe property had an estimated value of $15,000 at the time. Mitchell later sued Neff in the Circuit Court of Multnomah County in the state of Oregon for outstanding debts related to his legal services but because Neff was not to be found there Mitchell won the lawsuit by default judgment which was entered in Mitchell's favor after Neff failed to appear in court.\n\nWhen Mitchell won the lawsuit in February 1866, Neff's land grant had not yet been conferred and consequently Mitchell, possibly waiting for the arrival of the grant, waited until July 1866 to levy execution on the property. Mitchell arranged for the sheriff to seize the land, purchased it at public auction, and subsequently assigned it to Sylvester Pennoyer causing Neff to sue Pennoyer in 1874 in federal court to recover his land. After Neff won, Pennoyer appealed to the United States Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court was asked to determine whether a state court has personal jurisdiction over a non-resident (Neff) when such non-resident: (a) did not voluntarily appear before the court; (b) was not personally served with process while within the state; and (c) the non-resident held property within the state at the time of the original lawsuit, but the property was not attached to the suit when it was initiated. (Neff's property was attached by Mitchell later in an attempt to execute the judgment, but not at the beginning.)\n\nThe Supreme Court found for Neff and held that for the trial court to have jurisdiction over the property, the property needed to be attached before the start of litigation, whereupon the trial court has quasi in rem jurisdiction.\n\nConstructive notice as opposed to actual notice is insufficient under American law to inform a person living in another state except for cases affecting the personal status of an American plaintiff (like divorce) or cases that are \"in rem\", in which the property sought is within the boundaries of the state and the law presumes that property is always in the possession of the owner, and the owner, therefore, knows what happens to the property. Thus, attachment of the property before judicial proceedings makes constructive notice sufficient.\n\nMany aspects of the Court's ruling in this case have subsequently been overturned for cases in which personal or in personam jurisdiction is concerned. In a long series of United States Supreme Court jurisprudence following this ruling, the Court has modified the territorial analysis without overruling its holding. Indeed, it seems the basis of a state's authority to decide the \"status\" of its citizens, for example, as in a divorce without having personal jurisdiction over the respondent remains undisturbed.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has ruled that all determinations of state-court personal jurisdiction must be evaluated in light of and via application of the doctrine of \"minimum contacts.\" The \"minimum contacts test\" is now used almost exclusively in accordance with these decisions and has also been held to apply to jurisdictional analysis in federal court settings as well as state courts.\n\nThe doctrines governing personal jurisdiction in the United States have spawned a great deal of discourse within the Supreme Court of the United States with many cases finetuning and elaborating upon the concept, which has led to the test used today, in which the overall scope of the test for determining whether a court may exert personal jurisdiction over a party has been expanded in certain respects but narrowed in others. Nevertheless, in every case, the Supreme Court has ruled that such analyses must comport with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn law schools, the Pennoyer case is commonly taught in civil procedure classes. While scholars disagree as to the extent that federal legal procedure remains bound to its direct legacy, Pennoyer is a seminal sample of early jurisdictional jurisprudence.\n\n\n\n"}

The fourth exam is given to students at the conclusion of the other three exams, and is taken home for completion. In addition, all candidates for ministry must pass a fifth ordination exam typically given the first year of seminary called the Bible Content Exam.\n\nExams are graded by at least two readers. Each reader assigns a grade of Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory to each essay question. Then if the student passes a majority of questions for that reader, the reader assigns a Satisfactory grade. If one reader passes a student, and a second fails that student, a third reader is then called in to make a final judgment and the use of the third reader is not visible to the student or their ordaining body.\n\nSpecial considerations are made for students whose first language is not English, and the exam is regularly administered in Spanish and Korean.\n\nIt is common for students to have to take their exams several times before passing. Up to 28% of ordained ministers will have repeated at least one exam. Some, though not all, presbyteries impose a limit on the number of times their candidates may attempt an exam. Others allow for alternative formats. Still, a fair number of students do not pass all of their exams after several tries. It is not unheard of for a candidate to be dismissed from the ordination process after multiple attempts to pass the tests have failed.\n\nIn addition, Presbyterian seminarians are required to pass an examination covering the content of the Bible. Practice exams are available here .\n\n"}
{"id": "2198753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198753", "title": "Covering sickness", "text": "Covering sickness\n\nCovering sickness, or dourine (French, from the Arabic \"darina\", meaning mangy (said of a female camel), feminine of \"darin\", meaning dirty), is a disease of horses and other members of the family Equidae. The disease is caused by \"Trypanosoma equiperdum\", which belongs to an important genus of parasitic protozoa, and is the only member of the genus that is spread through sexual intercourse. The occurrence of dourine is notifiable in the European Union under legislation from the OIE. There currently is no vaccine and although clinical signs can be treated, there is no cure.\n\n\"Trypanosoma equiperdum\" is one of three known strains from the \"Trypanosoma\" family; along with \"Trypanosoma evansi\" and \"Trypanosoma brucei\". \"Trypanosoma equiperdum\" has been discovered to be most closely linked to \"Trypanosoma evansi\", so much so that even observation under microscope is not sufficient to differentiate between the two as their structure is very similar.\n\nDourine is a unique disease in the sense that it has no known vectors or fomites existing in the natural world, other than members of the equine family, including donkeys, mules, and horses. In a laboratory setting, \"Trypanosoma equiperdum\" has been manipulated to adapt to and proliferate in other species, such as dogs, rabbits, mice and rats, but this has never been observed to occur naturally and without scientific manipulation. Although this limits spread of the disease because it is restricted to the equine population alone, the organism has developed complex mechanisms over time to better equip itself for prolonged survival in the equine species. This parasite efficiently evades the host animal's immune system through the use of variable surface glycoproteins or VSGs. These VSGs allow the organism to constantly manipulate and change the surface structure of its proteins, which means it is constantly being presented to the immune system as a new foreign organism and this prevents the body from mounting a large enough immune response to eradicate the disease. In this sense, \"Trypanosoma equiperdum\" is a very efficient organism; it may infect less species than other diseases, but it infects and survives very efficiently within its specified hosts.\n\nBecause this disease is highly durable in its equine host, it has proved very difficult to develop a vaccine for it. There are four main drugs on the market that are used to treat the clinical signs of dourine: Suramin, Diminazen, Cymerlarsan, and Quinapyramin. However, none of the listed drugs are a cure and even the individual animals that are treated will experience relapses. Although this disease is not fatal in all cases and spontaneous recovery can occur, the death rate is relatively high and listed at a mortality rate of over fifty percent.\n\nThis lack of a cure or vaccine is a definite problem in the equine industry, especially in developing countries where equines are highly valuable for both agriculture and transportation. Dourine is considered an endemic problem in developing countries, where over sixty percent of equines in the world are located. The protocol for this disease, as stated by OIE, currently stands at slaughter of seropositive animals. This is not an economically feasible option for many people who depend on horses for their livelihood. Therefore, it is crucial to continue research in this field and develop a viable vaccine.\n\n"}
{"id": "2198757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198757", "title": "Malik al-Ashtar", "text": "Malik al-Ashtar\n\nMalik al-Ashtar (), also known as Mālik bin al-Ḥārith al-Nakhaʿīy al-Maḏḥijīy (), was one of the most loyal companions of the Ali Ibn Abi Talib, cousin of Prophet Muhammad. Malik al-Ashtar became a Muslim during the time of Prophet Muhammad and since then remained an avid and loyal supporter of Muhammad's progeny and Hashemite clan. He rose to a position of prominence during the caliphate of Ali Ibn Abi Talib and participated in several battles, such as the Battle of Jamal and Siffin.\n\nMalik has been described as a \"brave\" and \"fearless\" warrior by numerous Shia sources and his title \"\"al-Ashtar\"\" signifies an eyelid injury he received during the Battle of Yarmouk.\n\nAlthough Malik's actual birth year is not known, many historians say that he was 10 years older than Ali Ibn Abi Talib and 20 years younger than Muhammad. Moreover, it is known that Malik was a Madh'hij, a sub-class of the Bani Nakha tribe from Yemen. which is also the tribe of another Sahabah named Amru bin Ma'adi Yakrib\n\nHis lineage is traced back to Yarab bin Qahtan which genealogy can be traced by sorting his paternal surname Malik bin Al Hareth bin Abed Yaghouth bin Salamah bin Rabha bin Al Harith bin Jathima bin Malik bin Al Naghe bin Amro bin Alaae bin Khald bin Mathgah bin Addad bin Zayd bin Urayb bin Zayd bin Kahlan bin Saba al Akbar bin Youshgab bin Yarab\n\nIn the year 30 AH (after Hijra) or 650 CE, many Muslims living in the city of Kufa were angered over the action of the governor Waleed ibn Uqba (the half brother of Uthman ibn Affan). People went to Mu'awiyah with complaint, the gathering included Malik al-Ashtar and Kumayl ibn Ziyad as well.\n\nThey were exiled them from Shaam to Homs. But eventually, Malik al-Ashtar, Kumayl ibn Ziyad, and the delegation made it back to Kufa. After coming back to Kufa and failing to remove al-Waleed, the delegation of Muslims (one of whom was Kumayl ibn Ziyad) led by Malik al-Ashtar set off on a journey to Madina, the capital of the Muslim empire, to address the issue with Uthman. Kumayl ibn Ziyad, Malik al-Ashtar, Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhaifa, and Abdur Rahman ibn Udays were the ones who spoke out most about al-Waleed and the corruption that was occurring.\n\nOn their way to Madina, Malik al-Ashtar and the delegation stopped at al-Rabathan to visit Abu Dharr al-Ghifari. Abu Dharr, who was a companion of Muhammad and firm supporter and companion of Ali, was banished to die in the desert of Al-Rabathan. At the time, 650 a.d, Abu Dharr's health was deteriorating. Narrations state that his wife would cry, seeing her husband slowly die in the desert. However, Abu Dharr told her the prophecy of his death, which was given to him by none other than Muhammad, messenger of God. He would say, \"One day, my friends and I was sitting with Allah's Apostle (Muhammad). And he said to us: One of you will die in the desert. And a group of believers will attend his death. All my friends passed away in their houses. And no one has remained but I. A person will come to your aid.\" His wife then stated, \"The time of Hajj (Pilgrimage) is over. And no one has passed through this desert.\" Abu Dharr then told her \"Don't worry! Go up the hill and look at the road of caravans.\" So she went and eventually saw a caravan coming towards her. When she saw the caravan, she started to wave a piece of cloth to get the attention of the on coming caravan. When the caravan approached her she started a conversation. \n\nMalik and the delegation then sat next to Abu Dhurr. They felt sorrow to see one of the great companions of the prophet in bad condition. Malik told Abu Dhurr that they were on their way to Medina to meet with Uthman over the issue of al-Waleed. Upon hearing the news of al-Waleed, Abu Dhur became sad.\n\nAfter the event of al-Rabathah, Malik and the delegation continued on their long journey to Medina. When finally met Uthman, they communicated their concerns and al-Waleed's behaviors to Uthman. However they were unsuccessful in their mission thus they decided to seek Hazrat Ali's help.\n\nSince Uthman denied to hear the concerns about al-Waleed, the delegation of concerned Muslims went to the house of Ali in Medina. They told Ali the situation with al-Waleed and Uthman. Ali was sad to hear the news. However, he assured them that he would visit Uthman personally regarding this issue. In his meeting with Uthman, Ali said \"Uthman, the Muslims are complaining of the rulers' persecution. And you know that very well I've heard Allah's Apostle (Muhammad) saying: On the Day of Judgement, the unjust imam will be brought to hell. And no one will support or excuse him. Then, he will be thrown into hell. He'll go round and round it till he gets into its intense heat.\" This statement made Uthman realize his mistakes. And as a result, Uthman promised to seek God's forgiveness and apologize to the Muslims. However, Marwan bin al-Hakam, the cousin of Uthman, persuaded Uthman not to do so by saying \"You'd better threaten the people so as no one would dare to say bad words against the Caliph (Uthman).\" Due to Marwan, Uthman broke his promise and became stricter. It is documented that he hit the noble companion Ammar ibn Yasir and whipped the companion Abdullah bin Masoud. The stricter policies caused an uproar in the Muslim empire; people began writing letter such as the following below.\n\nMuslims, come to us. And save the Caliphate. Allah's Book has been changed. And the Prophet's Sunnah has been changed. So, come to us if you believe in Allah and the Day of Judgement.\n\nIn a true democratic matter, Malik al-Ashtar represented the enraged Muslim in a meeting with Uthman. In the meeting, Malik asked Uthman to step down from power, but Uthman refused. Uthman's refusal to step down only led to increasing problems. Ali tried to help Uthman and resolve the issue. He sent his own two sons, Hasan ibn Ali and Hussein ibn Ali to go to Uthman and protect him from the angry protesters. Despite this, protesters broke into Uthman's room and killed him. After the killing of Uthman, many Muslims went to Ali and asked him to become the new caliph (leader). But he refused, but Malik and others insisted that he become the caliph. To which Malik addresses, \"People, this is the Prophet's Regent. He has learnt the Prophet's knowledge. Allah's Book has mentioned his belief. Allah's Apostle [s] has told him that he will enter al-Ridhwan Garden. His personality is perfect The people in the past and present are certain of his behaviour and knowledge.\" Malik was one of the first to appoint Ali as the new caliph.\n\nAfter the downfall of Uthman, many Muslims wanted to gain power within the Islamic Empire. However, Ali was appointed as the new caliph. This upset power-hungry Muslims and the enemies of Ali. As a result, they planned to launch an offensive in the year 656 AD to fight against Ali under the claim that they wanted revenge for the killing of Uthman. One of these was Marwan al Hakim, who would later become a loyal supporter of Mu'awiyah. Marwan played a key role in the Battle of Jamal, in that he formed a large army to fight against Ali. He also bankrolled the army with money that he had stolen from the Public Treasury (money which was supposed to be for Muslim citizens) during the time of Uthman. The army included Aisha, Talha (a friend of Ali), Zubair (the cousin of Ali), and Marwan. Once the army was formed, the rebels headed to Basrah, Iraq. When Ali got news that a mutiny was going to occur, he also formed an army to combat the rebel forces. During the mutiny, the new governor of Kufa, Abu Musa al-Ashary, encouraged the Kufains (citizens of Kufa) not to join Ali's army. Additionally, he encouraged the people to distance themselves and disobey the new caliph, Ali. When Ali realized the situation in Kufa, he sent Malik al-Ashter to rally up troops. As a firm and loyal supporter of Ali Ibn Abi Talib, Malik rallied up the Kufian (citizens of Kufa) with a powerful speech. In the meantime, Abu Musa al-Ashary was commanding people to stay in their homes and not fight for Ali. Malik understood that he needed to remove Abu Musa al-Ashary. So Malik and a large group of fighters seized the palace. Luckily, Abu Musa al-Ashary was at the mosque. His guards informed him that Malik al-Ashtar and a large number of fighters had taken control of the palace. Since Abu Musa al-Ashary was not capable of fighting off Malik, he surrendered. And asked Malik to give him a day to leave Kufa. Malik accepted his offer and let Abu Musa al-Ashary leave peacefully. Once Abu Musa al-Ashary left, Malik delivered another powerful speech (in the mosque) that captivated the hearts of the Kufains. The speech successfully aroused more than 18,000 soldier to join him in order to defend against the rebel attack. 9,000 of those troops were under Malik's commands and the other 9,000 were under Hasan (the eldest son of Ali) commands. They quickly headed towards Dhiqaar, Iraq to join Ali's army. On the day of the Battle of Camel, Ali Ibn Abi Talib put Malik al-Ashtar in charge of the right wing of his army, Ammar ibn Yasir in charge of the left wing of his army, and gave the flag to his son Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah. After both sides introduced themselves (Arabian custom/tradition), Ali asked his army not to attack because they might be mistaken. He also asked his army is there is a brave soul who can take the Quran and appeal to them (the rebels). A brave young man told Ali that he is willing to do it. When the young man turned towards the rebels, the rebels killed him. After this, Ali raised his hands towards the sky and prayed \"Allah, the eyes are gazing at you! And the hands are extended! Our lord, judge between our nation and us with justice! And you're the best judge!\" When he finished, the war began. Malik al-Ashtar and his soldiers advanced fighting bravely. During the war, Ali Ibn Abi Talib told Malik that as long as the camel of Aisha is standing the war will continue. In order, to end the war he orders Malik al-Ashtar to cut the feet of the Aisha's camel. In addition, he orders Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, the blood brother of Aisha, to catch Aisha when she falls of the camel. Both Malik and Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr carried out their assignments, thus ending the battle. Above all, Ali ordered his soldiers to escort Aisha safely back to Medina, release the prisoners of war, and cure the injured rebels. Moreover, he forgave/pardoned all the rebels for their actions. However, after the war, Malik al-Ashtar and Ammar bin Yasir went to Aisha. Many scholars state that Malik was 70 years old in the Battle of Jamal. Overall, Malik al-Ahstar was the main cavalry and commander of the army of Ali Ibn Abi Talib in the Battle of Jamal (Battle of the Camel).\n\nAlthough the minor conflict occurred in Kirkeesya, the war took place at Siffeen (on the banks of the Euphrates) when Mu'awiyah headed a large reinforcing army to join Abi al-Awar al-Salmy and his army (Mu'awiyah's first army that attacked at night). Mu'awiyah brought reinforcements because during the minor conflict many of his soldiers were killed and injured. When they got to Siffeen, Mu'awiyah ordered an offensive to his army to gain control of the Euphrates River. By taking the control of water, Mu'awiyah violated an Islamic law and the laws of war. Therefore, Ali sent Sasaah bin Suhan, one of the companions of the Prophet, to ask for some water. He states to Mu'awiyah, \"Mu'awiyah, Ali says: Let us take some water. Then we'll decide what's between you and us, otherwise we will fight each other till the victor drinks.\" Mu'awiyah replied \"I'll answer you later on.\" After Sasaah bin Suhan left, Mu'awiyah sought advice from his trusted men about what he should do about the water situation. Al-Waleed bin Uthbah (the ex-governor of Kufa, which the Quran calls a Fasiq Sura 49 Verse 6) advised Mu'awiyah to \"Prevent them from drinking water to force them to surrender.\" Mu'awiyah and the other men agreed. Over the course of time, Malik watched the military supply and movements taking place on the river banks. He then realized that Mu'awiyah is tightening the siege of the Euphrates River. During the course of war, the soldier in the army of Ali Ibn Abi Talib became thirsty due to the physical exertion and blistering heat. Even Malik himself became thirsty. To which a man came up to Malik and said \"There's only little water in my water-skin, please drink it.\" But Malik refused and told him \"I won't drink till all soldiers drink!\" Noticing that most of the soldiers were thirsty, Malik went to Ali and said \"Amirul Mu'mineen, our soldiers are very thirsty. We've nothing but fighting.\" So Ali Ibn Abi Talib wrote a letter to Muawiyah asking for water. However, Mu'awiyah denied giving Ali Ibn Abi Talib's soldiers water. Once again, Malik al-Ashtar plays a huge role for the army of Ali Ibn Abi Talib . Ali Ibn Abi Talib calls Malik and asks him to lead his soldiers in an attack to gain possession of the Euphrates River. Malik and his men fight valiantly and won back the possession of the Euphrates river. The following day, an arrow with a letter attached was shot at Ali's army. Soldiers read the letter which said \"From a loyal brother in the Shamian Army, Mu'awiyah is going to open the river to drown you. So, be careful!\" and passed the news around. This news caused the soldiers to withdraw from the banks of the Euphrates River. Mu'awiyah noticed this and decided to recapture the river for his army. Yet again, Ali sends his soldiers to fight of Mu'awiyah's troops and gain control of the river. At this point, Mu'awiyah became worried that now Ali won't allow them to drink water from the river. He even ask Amr ibn al-As, \"Do you think Ali will prevent us from drinking water?\" To which Amr replied, \"Ali doesn't do as you do!\" Ironically, Mu'awiyah's writes a letter to Ali Ibn Abi Talib asking him for water since his (Mu'awiyah) soldiers were now thirsty. Ali Ibn Abi Talib grants Mu'awiyah and his soldiers permission to drink water from the Euphrates River. Allowing the rebels to drink water changed the mindset of some people in Mu'awiyah's army. They reflected upon both Mu'awiyah and Ali. And realized that Mu'awiyah did everything and anything including breaking Islamic laws to win the war. Whereas, Ali did everything to represent the true Islam even if it meant losing the war. And at nighttime, some of Mu'awiyah's troops went and joined Ali's army because they represented the truth and humanity.\n\nAs the battle continued, Malik al-Ashtar fought his way through the opposing army until he was two rows away from Mu'awiyah's tent. Only two rows away from killing Mu'awiyah and ending the war. However, a situation occurred. Mu'awiyah wanted to trick Ali's army to stop fighting and disunite them by creating confusion. Mu'awiyah loved the idea and ordered his soldiers to place the Quran on their spear. When most of the soldiers of Ali saw this they stopped fighting. Though Ali knew that it was a trick by Mu'awiyah to create confusion and disunity, he told his army \"It's a trick! I was the first to invite them to Allah's Book. And I was the first to believe in it. They've disobeyed Allah and broken His promise.\" (this is referring to the negotiation/persuading process before the war) Ali wanted his soldier to continue fighting because they were so close to victory. Despite Ali's effort, 22,000 soldiers disobeyed his commands and said \"Stop fighting and order al-Ashtar to withdraw!\" Knowing that his own soldiers had turned their backs on him and a few group of true believers, Ali Ibn Abi Talib told his soldiers to command Malik to return for safety reasons. The messenger gave Malik the order. Even though, Malik knew that he has the opportunity to end the war and rid the world of Ma'uwiyah, he stopped and returned. Malik said \"If Ali ibn Abi Talib orders something, I have to return\".\n\nThey ceased fighting and agreed to an arbitration according to the Quran. Mu'awiyah chose Amr ibn al-As to represent him and Ali chose Abdullah bin Abbas (because he was a wise man who had a good knowledge of the Quran). But the rebel did not agree to Abdullah bin Abbas and told Ali to pick Abu Musa al-Ashary (because Abu Musa was not really a firm supporter of Ali therefore the rebels could get an upper hand in the arbitration). Ali replied to them saying \"I disagree with you on him. And Abdullah bin Abbas is better than he (Abu Musa).\" But the rebels again denied. Ali then chose Malik al-Ashtar to represent him. Once again, the rebels refused and insisted for Abu Musa. To avoid further chaos/conflict, Ali told them \"Do whatever you like!\" As a result, Amr ibn al-As and Abu Musa entered the arbitration. Knowing that Abu Musa was not a firm supporter of Ali, Amr ibn al-As deceived Abu Musa by saying \"Abu Musa, Mu'awiyah and Ali have caused all these troubles. So, lets dispose them and elect another man.\" Abu Musa took the bait and stated \"I'm removing Ali from the caliphate as I'm removing my ring from my finger.\", then he removed his ring. Afterwards, Amr ibn al-As said \"I'm fixing Mu'awwiyah to the caliphate as I'm fixing my ring to my finger.\", then he wore his ring. The trick worked but Ali still had control of the caliphate. Both sides did agree to a truce and a year of peace. Ali commanded his soldiers not to fight for a year, but a large group (who developed their own beliefs of \"La Hukma Illa Lillah\", meaning, \"no rulership except by Allah alone.\") broke away from Ali and disobeyed the agreement/orders. They became known as the Khawarij and fought Ali in the Battle of Nahrawan.\n\nAt the time, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was the governor of Egypt. Amr ibn al-As, one of Mu'awiyah's companions, wanted to become the governor of Egypt. So he rallied 6,000 soldiers and headed towards Egypt. After finding out about the possible overthrow, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr wrote to Ali Ibn Abi Talib asking for help and support. Ali Ibn Abi Talib wrote back assuring Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, son of the first caliph and then Ali's adopted son, that he is sending his best general and one of his closest companions, Malik al-Ashtar. Ali then told Malik: \"Malik, may Allah have mercy on you, go to Egypt. I have absolute trust in you. Rely on Allah! Use gentleness in its place and intensity in its place.\"\n\nMuhammad ibn Abū-Bakr was instructed to return to ʻAlī's capital city, Kufa. Malik Al-Ashtar was appointed Governor of Egypt in 658 (38 A.H.) by Alī ibn Abī-Tālib, the caliph of the Muslims, after the Battle of Siffin had ended.\n\nWhen Mu'awiyah received the news that Ali appointed Malik al-Ashtar as the new governor of Egypt, he was overwhelmed with worry. Knowing that al-Ashtar was of ferocious build and strength, Muawiyah is said to have formulated a plot to assassinate him using poison imported from Rome and sent a delegate with the poison to a certain man owning vast lands in al-Qilzim City (a service station/resting spot for travelers) on the borders of Egypt, requesting that he poison al-Ashtar in exchange for lifelong tax exemption. The man is said to have agreed to the envoy's request.\n\nOn the way to Egypt, Malik al-Ashtar decided to stop at al-Qilzim. Upon his arrival, the man (who agreed to poison Malik) invited Malik, the new governor of Egypt, for lunch at his house. Malik humbly accepted the man's invitation without knowing that he was going to kill him by Muawiyah I on a suggestion of 'Amr ibn al-'As. They went to his home to have lunch. The man placed the poisoned honey in a cup and placed it on the table. Malik took a spoonful of the poisoned honey. When Malik consumed the honey, the poison spread rapidly throughout his body. Malik realized that he was poisoned as soon as he felt pain in his stomach. After realizing that he was poisoned, Malik placed his hand on his stomach and said \"In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. We belong to Allah, and we'll come back to Him!\" The poison was so destructive and toxic that within moments Malik al-Ashtar died. Muawiyah is said to have rejoiced upon hearing of al-Ashtar's death.\n\nMalik had two sons, the first was named Ishaq (Isaac) and the other was named Ibrahim (Abraham). Ishaq was a phenomenal warrior who supported and valiantly gave his life to protect Hussain ibn Ali, the son of Ali, in the Battle of Karbala. After Habib ibn Muzahir, Ishaq killed the most enemy fighters. On the other hand, Ibrahim ibn Malik al-Ashtar, the son of Malik al-Ashtar, along with Mukhtar al-Thaqafi rose against the killers of Hussain ibn Ali. The two killed most of the killers of Hussain and his army. For example, they caught and killed Umar ibn Sa'ad, Shimr ibn Thil-Jawshan, Sanan ibn Anas, Hurmala ibn Kahil and Ubaidullah Ibn Ziyad (these were Yazid I's soldiers who fought against Hussain).\n\nAmong his descendants are the Kalbasi family, who reside in Iran and some reside in Iraq. One branch of this family adds the title \"Ashtari\" to the end of their family name to denote this fact. \nIn Lebanon, the Hamadani family from the southern town of Nabatieh are also direct descendants who have maintained a family tree dating back to the Nakha'i tribe origins. The Mroueh family, after tracing their lineage, are also believed to be descendants. The Malek (or Malekian) family, from Mazandaran (Iran), are also believed to be descendants.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2198769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2198769", "title": "University of Sindh", "text": "University of Sindh\n\nThe University of Sindh (; , informally known as Sindh University) is a public research university in the education city of Jamshoro, Sindh, Pakistan near the city of Hyderabad. It is one of the oldest universities in Pakistan and was certified by ISO in 2015. In 2013, the University was ranked eighth in \"General Category\" by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan.\n\nFounded in 1947 in Karachi, the University was relocated to Hyderabad where it began to function as a full-fledged teaching university. The University is associated with four colleges of law and various other colleges. Sindh University is noted for its research in literature, natural sciences, philosophy, and Sindhology. The University is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities of the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter Pakistan gained independence in 1947, the only functioning university in the newly founded nation was the University of Punjab, which served the developed parts of the Punjab province. The Sindh province came under the academic purview of the University of Bombay, which had become a part of India.\n\nA formal academic centre was therefore needed for Sindh and under the constitutional act 27, titled \"University of Sindh\", a resolution was passed by the provincial Legislative Assembly which founded the new university in Karachi, the national capital at the time. The act would later be revised in 1961 and several other times in the years to come. The 1972 revision allowed for the greater autonomy and representation of faculty that the University currently enjoys.\n\nFrom independence in 1947 until 1955, Hyderabad was declared as the capital of Sindh and University operations were relocated from Karachi to Hyderabad in 1951, where it formally began to function as a teaching institution striving to fulfil its charter and its mission to disseminate knowledge.\n\nThe first department established at the University was the Department of Education, later renamed the Faculty of Education. The departments of basic science disciplines, as well as other departments of Humanities and Social Sciences, were added in the mid-1950s. With the sudden departmentalised growth of the University's organisational structure, a better equipped campus was desired. A new campus was established in 1955 in Jamshoro, 15 km from Hyderabad, on the right bank of the Indus river. This new campus was named after Allama Imdad Ali Imam Ali Kazi, former vice-chancellor of the University, as a tribute to his legacy as an esteemed scholar. Before Jamshoro was selected for the establishment of Sindh University, it was desolate and sparse but was deemed more suitable than Hyderabad, which lacked sufficient space to satisfy the University's ambitious expansion programs.\n\nSindh University is administered from its central campus at Jamshoro. It is a collegiate university, encompassing four legal colleges and 74 undergraduate and post-graduate colleges in the vicinity of Hyderabad and elsewhere in Sindh. Located near the Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, and Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences, Jamshoro is the largest university city in Pakistan.\n\nThe University has two main campuses (1 and 2) and seven other campuses.\n\nThe University's central administration, headed by the vice chancellor, is located in central Jamshoro. The campus comprises seven faculties: those of arts, pharmacy, education, Islamic studies, social sciences, natural sciences, and commerce and business administration. Each faculty is overseen by a dean appointed by the vice chancellor. Each faculty is housed in its own building. Colleges affiliated with the University primarily enforce curricular requirements and host examinations for degree-awarding status.\n\nAcademic faculties of the University offer courses which culminate in undergraduate bachelor's, bachelor's honours (an extra year added to the bachelor's course) and postgraduate master's degrees and provide research guidance for the M.Phil and PhD programmes. The teaching and research under the faculties of natural sciences, social sciences, arts, education, Islamic studies, commerce and business administration are directly imparted by the University.\n\nEach faculty is headed by a dean, appointed by the vice-chancellor for three years. The University's teaching departments, institutes and centres offer programmes culminating in a four-year bachelor's (honours) degree in general and basic disciplines under arts and humanities studies, while a four-year bachelor's degree is offered under the faculty of natural sciences. The degrees have been designated accordingly indicating various disciplines, e.g., for Computer Science, BSc(CS) and Information Technology BSc(IT), etc.\n\nThe master's degree programmes are usually over one year after a bachelor's (honours) degree and over two years after other bachelor degrees. The latter programmes are conducted through affiliated colleges under the jurisdiction of the University. The teaching under the faculty of law is conducted through the affiliated professional law colleges.\n\nDegree programs with evening classes were introduced in 2002 and include master's degree courses in English and information technology disciplines such as e-commerce and multimedia technology. Many teaching departments offer a one-year postgraduate diploma as well as short-term certifications. Some of the degree colleges in the private sector that are affiliated with the University offer three-year bachelor's honours and master's degree programmes.\n\nThe development programmes initiated in 1959 have gradually borne fruit. Though still under construction, about 20 teaching blocks housing 39 institutes, departments and centres have been constructed. Five student residential halls now provide accommodation for about 1800 students.\n\nSporting facilities include the Hyder Bux Jatoi Pavilion constructed to provide indoor gaming facilities, a track ground for athletics and a sports grounds. The Fatima Jinah Gymnasium provides game and sport facilities exclusively for women. The Institute of Sindhology building, depicting the cultural heritage of Sindh, adorns the entrance to the campus from the national highway leading to Karachi. The imposing central library building, named after Allama I.I. Kazi, serves as a landmark.\n\nThe residences for faculty and staff house roughly a third of the University's employees. The University intends to expand the faculty residences and provide accommodation for 200 more employees. Formerly deserted patches of hilly tract have now been converted into tree lined roads and green pasture. The location of Mehran University, sharing the site with the Sindh University and the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences college and hospital complex in the neighbourhood substantially aided in the development of this land into a university town.\n\nThe university is accessible via the national highway (N5) at the Hyderabad bypass, about 150 km from Karachi and 15 to 18 km from Hyderabad. It has hosted international conferences, symposiums and seminars on science and education and on specialized scientific themes. Inter-university sports competitions and annual sports gatherings have become regular features. The museum and art galleries of the Institute of Sindhology attract many visitors from other parts of Pakistan and the world.\nThe university has established links with the following leading universities of the United Kingdom to promote research and encourage faculty development.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The secular studies with particular sensitivity to Christian values fall under the Ministry of Education.\n\nThe university traces its history to Warsaw Theological Academy (\"Akademia Teologii Katolickiej\"), created by the Polish communist government after it had closed down the theology departments at University of Warsaw and Jagiellonian University. The academy did not receive full acceptance from Roman Catholic Church in Poland until the fall of communist authorities in 1989 removed state control over the institution. In 1999 the academy was transformed into the current university.\n\nThe university consists of two main campuses in Warsaw's northern districts. The old one at Bielany and the new one at Mlociny, which mostly houses arts and humanities faculties.\n\n\n\n"}

The album is thus similar to the 1987 compilation album \"Twelve Inch Singles\" and contains much of the same material. Most of the songs on the album were initially released on the Wax Trax! label. As can be expected from Ministry's early work, the album features a strong synthpop and new wave flavor - Ministry moved more definitively into the industrial metal genre later into their career (post \"Twitch\"). The album also shows Ministry's early gothic rock beginnings, with the two mixes of \"I'm Falling\" and \"Overkill\" being some of their earliest tracks.\n\n\n\n"}

It sold at auction in 2004 for £744,800, which was the record at the time for any Scottish painting, and for any painting ever sold in Scotland. Reproductions of \"The Singing Butler\" make it the best-selling art print in the UK.\n\nThe painting measures . It depicts a couple dancing on the damp sand of a beach on the coast of Fife, with grey skies above a low horizon. Two attendants to the left and right, a maid and a butler, hold up umbrellas against the weather. The dancers wear evening dress: a dinner jacket, and a red ball gown; the woman also wears red long gloves but appears to have bare feet. The butler is also formally dressed, while the maid wears a white apron and clutches her hat.\n\nAs a contemporary cultural icon, \"The Singing Butler\" has been compared to Grant Wood's \"American Gothic\". Vettriano has described the painting as an \"uplifting fantasy\" and chose the subject after being complimented on his paintings of beaches. He added the servants to balance the composition. His work has been widely criticised by art critics, but is popular with the public. \"The Singing Butler\" has been criticised for its uneven finishing, inconsistent lighting and treatment of wind, and for the odd position of the dancers. The dancers' pose is reversed from a normal closed dance hold. Usually, with the man leading, his left hand would hold the woman's right hand, and he would place his right hand on or below the woman's left shoulder blade, while she places her left hand on his right arm, just below the shoulder.\nThe original painting was sold at auction in August 2003 for £90,000, and then sold to a private collector in April 2004 for £744,800, a Scottish record at that time. After the painting was sold, it was reported that Vettriano had used an artists' reference manual, \"The Illustrator's Figure Reference Manual\", as a basis for the figures (the female figure in the reference work is actress Orla Brady). Vettriano retorts that Francis Bacon had the same book in his studio, and that Picasso said that some artists borrowed but he stole.\n\nThe female dancer wears a green dress in another version of the painting, \"Dancer in Emerald\", which also omits the maid. Both paintings were included in Vettriano's first London exhibition, God's Children, at the Mall Galleries in October 1992. The original painting of \"The Singing Butler\" was displayed at Aberdeen Art Gallery in February 2012, its first public exhibition for 20 years.\n\n"}
