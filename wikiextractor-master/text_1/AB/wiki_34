{"id": "1957372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957372", "title": "Ford Super Duty", "text": "Ford Super Duty\n\nThe Ford F-Series Super Duty (often shortened to Ford Super Duty) is a series of trucks manufactured by Ford Motor Company. Introduced in 1998 for the 1999 model year, the F-Series Super Duty trucks marked the addition of a heavy-duty pickup to the Ford F-Series range with the new versions of the F-250, F-350, and F-450 pickups, while the previous 1987–1997 F-Super Duty chassis cabs were replaced by the F-450 chassis cab and F-550 Super Duty.\n\nThe Super Duty trucks utilize a distinct chassis from the lighter F-150, with heavier-duty chassis and suspension components to allow for higher payload and towing capacities; additionally, the product line continued the use of Ford PowerStroke diesel engines. With a GVWR over , Super Duty pickups are class 2 and 3 trucks while chassis cab trucks are class 4 and class 5. The F-Series Super Duty has been used as the base chassis of the Ford Excursion full-size SUV.\n\nFord F-250 to F-550 Super Duty trucks are assembled at the Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, Kentucky, while medium-duty F-650 and F-750s are assembled at Ohio Assembly in Avon Lake, Ohio (prior to 2016, medium-duty trucks were assembled in the Blue Diamond Truck joint venture with Navistar in Mexico). As of 2016, the Ford Super Duty is sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela (F-250 and F-350), Suriname, Brazil (F-350/F-4000), Argentina (F-4000 only), Angola (F-250 and F-350), Cambodia, the Middle East, and Iceland (F-350 only) in LHD only. In Suriname, even though traffic is on the left side of the road, the import and registry of left hand drive vehicles is allowed. In Australia, it was officially imported in right hand drive from Brazil between 2001–06, however as of 2007, Ford no longer offers the Super Duty in Australia.\n\nIn 1958, Ford introduced the Super Duty family of V8 engines. Built specifically for trucks, the 401, 477, and 534 cubic-inch gasoline V8s were the largest-block V8 engines ever built by Ford Motor Company (other than the 1100 cu in GAA, developed for the US Army as a tank powerplant; this however was a 'cut-down' V-12, with a 60° V-angle, and was not originally designed as a V-8), and were the largest mass-produced gasoline V8 engines in the world. To showcase the engine launch, the \"Big Job\" conventional truck variants of the F-Series were re-branded as Super Duty, a name added to other Ford trucks as well. Alongside the Ford C-Series and H-Series cabovers, the N-Series conventional adopted the Super Duty name. Although its poor fuel economy would prove uncompetitive against diesel engines, the durability of the Super Duty would keep it in production into 1981.\n\nIn 1987 Ford would revitalize the name as a Class 4 truck badged as \"F-Super Duty\", Manufactured as a chassis cab with the frame open for a bed that would suit its future application, these trucks would be equipped with the 7.5 liter gasoline engine or a 7.3 liter IDI diesel engine. The weight and class of these trucks would make them the heaviest trucks in the F-Series line at the time.\n\nFollowing the redesign of the 1997 Ford F-150, the Ford F-Series began a transition in its layout. In response to the changing demographics of pickup truck purchases during the 1980s and 1990s, Ford shifted the design of the F-150 separate from the larger F-250 and F-350 (which remained in production). While still a full-size pickup under the skin, to expand its appeal among consumers, the F-150 adopted carlike aerodynamics and convenience features. To market a truck that appealed towards commercial buyers, fleet buyers, and users who tow, Ford sought to create a separate, dedicated heavy-duty truck platform (in place of using one chassis for all of its trucks). By expanding into two separate but related platforms for F-Series trucks, the inevitable compromises inherent in offering a wide range of load-carrying capacities were avoided. The F-250HD lasted into 1997 (alongside a separate 1997/1998 F-250 based upon the F-150); the F-350 pickup was put on hiatus after 1997.\n\nBeginning production in early 1998 for the 1999 model, the Ford F-Series Super Duty consisted of the F-250 pickup truck, F-350 pickup truck and chassis cab, and introduced the F-450 and F-550 chassis cab trucks \"(see below)\". The Super Duty trucks would be produced with three cab configurations: two-door standard cab, 2+2 door SuperCab, and four-door crew cab. The SuperCab configuration of the Super Duty marked the introduction of two standard rear-hinged doors on the extended cab, a feature also adopted by the F-150 and Ranger/Mazda B-Series for 1999. The standard cab was produced with an 8-foot bed; SuperCab and crew cabs were produced with a 6 3/4-foot bed, with an 8-foot bed optional. Two-wheel drive was standard, with four-wheel drive as an option; on F-350 pickup trucks, a dual rear-wheel axle was optional with either drive configuration.\n\nStyled by Andrew Jacobson (designer of the 1997 Ford F-150) and Moray Callum, aside from taillamp lenses and the tailgate, the Super Duty F-Series trucks share no visible exterior parts with the Ford F-150. Under the skin, only the base-equipment 5.4L V8 and 4R100 transmission are shared. While sharing the similar aerodynamic cab design of its smaller counterpart, the exterior of the Super Duty trucks are much different forward of the windshield. While an influence often compared to the 1994–2002 Dodge Ram, the Super Duty also derives elements of styling from much larger Ford trucks, including the Ford LTL-9000 and Aeromax, with a raised hoodline, large grille, and low fenders. A feature drawn from 1996 redesign of the Louisville/Aeromax was in the design of the side window openings: the front portion is lowered, allowing for increased side visibility (as well as larger sideview mirrors). To improve aerodynamics over metal-framed mirrors, manual-telescoping trailer tow mirrors were available as an option. As an industry first, 2 large complete ring-style front tow hooks were included. A minor update occurred in the 2002 model year which saw a new instrument cluster with a digital odometer.\n\nFor the 2005 model year, the Ford Super Duty trucks were given exterior and interior updates. For the exterior, a new grille, front bumper, and headlights were introduced alongside the introduction of a locking tailgate for all pickup trucks. Under the skin (with thicker frame rails), updated Triton gasoline engines were introduced with higher engine output and larger alternators; in response to the increased power, all trucks were given 4-wheel disc brakes (with two-piston calipers). To accommodate the larger brakes, 17-inch wheels became standard, with 18-inch wheels optional (on single rear-wheel trucks); forged Alcoa wheels were an option. The long-running Twin I-Beam front suspension continued on two-wheel drive trucks.\n\nTo the interior, several changes were made to improve functionality for end-users. Along with the addition of a driver-side glove compartment, the truck added the option of dashboard-mounted auxiliary switches (for owners who fit equipment such as snowplows, winches, and auxiliary lights); these are switches that were typically user designed. For users that tow, a new option was Ford TowCommand, a Trailer brake controller built into the dashboard, allowing it to integrate with the ABS system and engine computer from the factory.\n\nDuring its production, the first-generation Ford F-Series Super Duty was sold with two gasoline and two diesel engines.\n\nReplacing the overhead-valve engines used in previous F-Series models, for the Super Duty, Ford transitioned to the Triton overhead-cam engine family (truck versions of the Ford Modular engines).\n\nAt its launch, the standard engine in the Super Duty was a Triton V8. Producing 255 hp/350 lb-ft of torque, the SOHC 16-valve V8 was shared with the F-150 and Ford E-Series. During 1999, the engine was retuned to 260 hp. In 2005, the cylinder heads were redesigned to 3-valve design, converting it to a 24-valve V8; output was increased to 300 hp/365 lb-ft of torque.\n\nAs a replacement for the long-running 7.5L/460 V8, for the Super Duty, Ford introduced a Triton V10. A SOHC 20-valve engine, the V10 produced 310 hp/425 lb-ft of torque. In 2005, the V10 would also receive 3-valve cylinder heads, increasing its output to 362 hp/457 lb-ft of torque.\n\nBoth the V8 and V10 Triton engines are designed with a fail-safe cooling system to protect the engine in case of major coolant loss. If the engine overheats, the engine will operate on half of its cylinders. Alternating back and forth between each set of 4 (or 5) pistons, the set that is not receiving fuel and ignition is operating to pump air through the engine to lower its temperature. Although engine output is limited, dependent on upon vehicle load, outside temperature, and current road conditions, the system is designed to allow the vehicle to travel a short distance to receive service or to reach a repair facility.\n\nAvailable in both F-250 and F-350 pickup trucks as well as F-450 and F-550 chassis cabs, the F-Series was sold with optional PowerStroke V8 diesel engines produced under its joint venture with Navistar International.\n\nAt its launch, the Super Duty F-Series was sold with the 7.3L Power Stroke V8. Initially producing 235 hp/500 lb-ft of torque, the engine was retuned in 2001. Versions equipped with an automatic transmission produced 250 hp while manual-transmission examples produced 275 hp; with either transmission, the engine produced 525 lb-ft of torque. As the 7.3L V8 was no longer able to comply with emissions regulations for diesel engines, it was discontinued midway through the 2003 model year.\n\nAs a running change during the 2003 model year, the 6.0L PowerStroke V8 was introduced as the replacement for the previous 7.3L V8 in LHD markets supplied with the American-assembled trucks while RHD ones supplied from Brazil kept the 7.3 until 2005. As before, the engine continued to be produced by Navistar. A 32-valve pushrod engine, the 6.0L V8 featured a single variable-vane turbocharger. While a smaller-displacement engine than its predecessor, its output is higher than the 7.3L, providing 325 hp/560 lb-ft of torque (in 2005, the torque increased to 570 lb-ft). Due to problems with the head bolts Navistar re-designed the engine with reinforced heads, more torque and, power releasing the new design in 2005-6. As with its predecessor, the 6.0L would end its production run due to tighter emissions requirements, replaced as part of the Super Duty redesign for the 2008 model year.\n\nThe 6.0L Powerstroke was the target of a class-action lawsuit, alleging the engines were defective. Ford settled the lawsuit with owners and former owners of 6.0L diesel-equipped Super Duty trucks and E-Series vans in 2013, by reimbursing them for the cost of repairs to the EGR system, fuel injectors, and turbocharger, which were common failure points.\n\nFour transmissions were available. Several configurations of ZF5 five speed manual transmissions were offered: Small block pattern, big block pattern, and diesel. Close ratio and wide ratios were available, as well as 4wd and 2wd configurations with the exception of integrated driveshaft brake 2wd versions using the 4x4 style transmission. Earlier s5-42 versions were rated to 570 Nm (420 ft lbs) of torque, while later s5-47 versions were rated to 636 Nm (470 ft lbs). ZF 6-speed manual for diesel engines. An optional 4R100 4-speed automatic was available for either the gas or diesel engines, later being replaced with the TorqShift 5-speed automatic. The 5-speed automatics are rated at exactly , enabling higher towing capacity than trucks with the standard 5/6-speed manual transmission. The 6-speed manual transmission comes with an integrated PTO.\n\nThe Torqshift 5-speed 5R110 automatic transmission replaced the 4-speed in the 2003 model year diesel trucks in order to compete with the Allison 1000 series from General Motors; it was paired with the new 6.0 L diesel engine. The TorqShift design in fact has six forward ratios, but only five are advertised, with the 'hidden' gear only used in extreme cold weather. The TorqShift 1st to 5th gear ratios are 3.11, 2.22, 1.55, 1.00, and 0.71:1. It also utilizes an alternate 4th gear, overdrive on 2nd gear of the 3-speed automatic component (0.72 x 1.55), that is 1.10:1 that is used under cold start conditions to aid engine and transmission warm up. On the TorqShift, once the Tow/Haul mode is activated it can help increase a driver's control when towing large loads up and down steep grades and automatically minimizes shifts and maximizes available torque. Upon descent, the Tow/Haul mode utilizes engine braking to help extend brake life and improve driver control. An adaptive shift function monitors the TorqShift's performance over its lifetime, and adjusts shift pressures in real time to assure consistent shift feel and compensate for wear. For ease of maintenance, the TorqShift's oil filter is an easily serviced cartridge design that was usually mounted on the passenger side behind the front bumper. Also the TorqShift's larger fluid lines and a larger transmission oil cooler help to assure cooler operating temperatures, even under the most demanding conditions. This was Ford's first automatic transmission to feature PTO. The transmission can be equipped with an integrated PTO provision (which automatically locks the torque converter providing power to the PTO gear when the operator turns on the PTO switch).\n\nOn 4x4 models there is a choice of a manual chain-driven transfer case floor shifter with manual front locking hubs or Electronic-Shift-On-the-Fly (ESOF, a $185 option over the manual) dash knob with vacuum activated automatic and (in case of failure) manual override front hubs. The optional FX4 models are basically a standard 4x4 with an Off Road package that includes a few extras like upgraded heavy duty Rancho shocks, added skid plates for the fuel tank and transfer case, and two \"FX4\" decals on both back bed-sides instead of the standard \"4x4\". For all 4x4 models, the 2-speed transfer case 4x4-LOW range has a gear reduction of 2.72:1. Brazilian and Venezuelan versions had only the ESOF transfer case.\n\nFor the first-generation Super Duty range, Ford used several different suspension configurations, depending on the model of truck. All models have heavy-duty 3\" wide leaf springs and staggered shock absorbers. A standard stabilizer bar is included on dual rear-wheel models and an option on single rear-wheel versions. An optional slide-in camper certification package with heavier-duty springs was available on single rear-wheel models. All versions of the Super Duty trucks came equipped with four-wheel disc brakes.\n\nOn two-wheel drive F-250 and F-350 pickups, the Twin I-Beam independent front suspension with coil springs was used; their four-wheel drive counterparts were equipped with solid front axle (Dana 50 and Dana 60) with leaf springs. In 2005, the front suspension was updated as four-wheel drive trucks were converted to front coil springs; to reduce unsprung weight, the mounting of the front sway bar was changed to the frame instead of the front axle. The manual locking hubs on Super Duty trucks are made by Warn.\n\nOn the F-250 and F-350, the rear suspension used heavy-duty 3\" wide leaf springs and staggered shock absorbers; a standard stabilizer bar was included on dual rear-wheel models. Single-rear wheel versions were fitted with a Sterling 10.5 axle 35-spline axle with choices of conventional or limited-slip differentials; initially developed for previous-generation Ford trucks, it was strengthened for use in the Super Duty. In dual-rear wheel F-350s, the rear axle was a Dana 80.\n\nOn F-450 and F-550 cab-chassis trucks, the Dana 60 front axle was replaced with a Dana Super 60 in 2005. The rear suspension on 2011-2014 F-450s Pickup used Dana 80 axles and 2008-2010 & 2015-2018 F-450s Pickup used Dana S 110. F-450 cab-chassis used a Dana S 110. F-550s used a Dana 135 from 1995 to 2004; in 2005, the Dana S 110 rear axle was added to the F-550.\n\nThe Dana 50 axle featured on most F-250 Super Dutys differs greatly from the early models. The Dana 50 started out as a Twin Traction Beam axle (much like independent suspension) in 1980. This lasted all the way to 1997 models. The Super Duty models then used a solid axle version of this axle. The ring, pinion, carrier and u joints all remained the same however. The Dana 50 was phased out of the trucks in 2004, in favor of the Dana 60 and was last used in the Ford Excursion.\n\nThroughout its production run, the first-generation 1999-2007 Ford F-Series Super Duty was offered in three main trim levels:\n\nThe base XL was the \"work truck\" trim level of the F-Series Super Duty. Its standard features included a manual transmission, an AM/FM stereo with two front door-mounted speakers, a heater and blower, vinyl-trimmed seating surfaces with bench seats, steel wheels with black center hubs, black front and rear bumpers, a black \"egg-crate\" front grille, and manual windows and door locks. Optional features that were offered on this trim level included cloth-trimmed seating surfaces or vinyl-and-cloth-trimmed seating surfaces, power windows and door locks, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player (later, a single-disc CD player instead of a cassette player) and four speakers, chrome front and rear bumpers as part of an XL Decor Group, an automatic transmission, and air conditioning.\n\nThe mid-range XLT was the most popular trim level of the F-Series Super Duty. It added the following features to the base XL trim level: an AM/FM stereo with cassette player (later, a single-disc CD player instead of a cassette player) and four speakers, cloth-trimmed seating surfaces, bright center wheel hubs, chrome front and rear bumpers, a chrome \"egg-crate\" front grille with black inserts, power windows and door locks, and air conditioning. Optional features that were offered on this trim level included aluminum wheels, keyless entry (later, this option became standard equipment on this trim level), an AM/FM stereo with both a cassette player and a single-disc CD player (later, a six-disc, in-dash CD changer), an automatic transmission, and a power-adjustable front driver's bench seat.\n\nThe top-of-the-line Lariat was the most luxurious trim level of the F-Series Super Duty. It added the following features to the mid-range XLT trim level: an AM/FM stereo with both a cassette player and a single-disc CD player (later, a six-disc, in-dash CD changer), leather-trimmed seating surfaces, chrome-clad (later aluminum) wheels and center wheel hubs, keyless entry, a security system, electronic climate controls, a power front bench seat with fold-down center armrest, wood interior trim panels, and a chrome front grille with chrome inserts. Available options included two-tone exterior paint, color-keyed grille insert as well as front & rear bumpers, bucket seats replacing the bench seat, heated front seats, and an automatic transmission (which later became standard on this trim level).\n\nThere were multiple special edition Super Duty models that were offered.\n\nFor 2003, a special Centennial Edition Super Duty Crew Cab was offered to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Ford Motor Company. The truck could be ordered only as a Crew Cab, but a choice of bed lengths, DRW or SRW and gasoline or diesel engine were available. The Centennial Edition offered the following standard equipment: Monochromatic Black Clearcoat exterior, Premium Verona-grain Imola leather seating finished in Two-Tone Parchment, Special Centennial Edition badging and a commemorative keychain and wristwatch. The Centennial Edition also came with special leather-bound owners manual with the embossed signatures of Henry Ford, Edsel Ford, Henry Ford II, and William Clay Ford, Jr.\n\nFord offered a special Harley-Davidson Super Duty truck from 2004-2007. Available only on SRW models, the Harley package could be had with either SuperCab or Crew Cab and customers could choose either V10 gas or 6.0L Powerstroke turbo diesel power. Based upon the Lariat trim, Harleys had a unique black leather interior, with the Bar and Shield logo adorning the front and rear captains chairs (SuperCab models had a rear bench). Heated seats, a leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel, power adjustable pedals, and power-adjustable heated mirrors round out the standard equipment. Unique spun-metal gauge faceplates, embroidered carpeted floor mats, and a leather-wrapped console lid with individually serial numbered badging round out unique interior appointments. 2004 Harleys could be had with three unique paint schemes, Competition Orange/Black Clearcoat two-tone, Dark Shadow Gray/Black Clearcoat two-tone or a Black Clearcoat solid paint job. Unique pinstriping was found on all three color options.\n\n2005 saw changes to the Harley package corresponding with the refresh of the F-250 and F-350 Super Duty model. No longer could you order a SuperCab Harley-Davidson and the 5.4L V8 was added as the base engine for the package. New unique black trimmed headlights, billet-style grille, and 20\" wheels were made standard. Gone was the two-tone paint jobs, but optional was painted ghost flames. 2005 models could be had in two color options, Black or True Blue Metallic. The interior stayed largely the same, with luxurious black leather captains chairs in the front and rear and Harley Bar and Shield badging galore, but the truck saw the same interior updates as other '05 Super Dutys.\n\nTo bridge the gap between the pickup line and the much larger medium-duty F-650/F-750, Ford introduced the F-450 and F-550 variants of the Super Duty; with an available GVWR from 17,950-19,500 lbs, it pushes the Super Duty into the Class 5 truck market. Available only as a chassis cab for commercial upfitters, both versions were fitted with dual rear wheels.\n\nWhile largely aimed at fleet buyers, F-450 and F-550 were configurable in XL, XLT, and Lariat trim levels available to Super Duty pickup buyers. The sole gasoline engine was the 6.8L V10 while the 7.3L PowerStroke was the diesel option; in 2003, this was replaced by the 6.0L PowerStroke.\n\nIn 2005, the F-450 and F-550 received further updates to the exterior than the rest of the Super Duty line, with an extended front bumper and front fenders; the F-550 received a \"wide-track\" front axle to sharpen its turning radius.\n\nThe Ford F-350 Super Duty first generation was also assembled in Venezuela as a commercial small truck from 1999 to 2010. For this market the F-350 featured the 5.4L V8 Triton engine, a 5-speed manual transmission, and a choice of 4x2 or 4x4.\n\nFord Super Duty trucks were built in Brazil, with different engines than its North American counterparts and fewer options, initially between 1999 and 2011, with a limited reintroduction of the F-350 in 2014. The dual-rear wheel variant of the F-350 is known locally as F-4000. They were widely exported to Australia (F-250 and F-350), South Africa (F-250) and Argentina (F-250, rebadged as F-100, and the F-350 DRW rebadged as F-4000), usually following the Brazilian specification (with an obvious change of the cockpit location in the versions targeted to Australia, South Africa and other RHD markets) but Australia had a wider range of options in pair with its American counterparts, including automatic transmission and the V8 engines. Supercab extended-cab bodystyle was never officially available in Brazil and regional export markets (Uruguay and Argentina), but was made in RHD for export to Australia. South Africa had only the MWM engine and 5-speed manual transmission, with the option of 2WD and 4WD for the single-cab while the crew-cab had 4WD as standard.\n\nThe second-generation Super Duty was supposed to debut for model year 2007, but quality issues pushed it back to the 2008 model year. It features an all-new Power Stroke Diesel V8 with piezo fuel injectors and sequential turbos to replace the problematic 6.0 L Power Stroke single-turbo Diesel V8. The new engine produces 350 hp (260 kW) and of torque. The vehicle had its first official showing at the Texas State Fair in 2006. Ford started taking orders in January 2007. The first 2008 F450 pickup, sold to the public, was delivered to Randy Whipple of Muskegon, Michigan in February 2007.\n\nLocated near the same dash area as the last generation (but slightly to the right and more directly below the radio), this generation of Super Duty has the same Ford TowCommand TBC (Trailer Brake Controller) and 4 AUX Upfitter switches as the last generation set-up.\n\nThere is an optional concealed slide-out step and swing-up hand grab bar in the rear tailgate for easy access.\n\nFord introduces its all new optional \"Rapid-Heat Supplemental Cab Heater,\" only available on Super Duty trucks with the Diesel engine and TorqShift automatic transmission. In the winter, it quickly raises the cabin temperature to a comfortable level until the engine is warm enough to handle the job.\n\nThis 2nd generation of Super Duty includes the F-250 Super Duty (starting at $22,380), F-350 Super Duty (starting at $24,025), and the all new F-450 Super Duty (starting at $39,205). The F-250 and F-350 Super Duty basically has the same payload and towing specs as the last generation.\n\nThe model lineup for the 2010 F-250 and F-350 Super Duty is the XL (starting at $25,300), XLT (starting at $28,845), Lariat (starting at $36,420), Cabela's (starting at $42,655), King Ranch (starting at $42,955), and Harley-Davidson (starting at $56,925).\n\nThe model lineup for the F-450 Super Duty is the XL (starting at $44,145), XLT (starting at $49,525), Lariat (starting at $52,965), King Ranch (starting at $56,955), and the Harley-Davidson (starting at $62,625)\n\nThe FX4 model, which was once just an optional Off Road 4x4 package that could be added to any model in the lineup, is replaced by the 4x4 Off Road Package. The FX4 became a model of its own. It still had the same specs as the previous generation but with more of a sporty trim package. The FX4 model has been discontinued for the 2010 model year and has been reverted to an optional Off Road 4X4 package.\n\n\nFor 2008, Ford and Harley-Davidson once again joined forces to bring out a new special edition Super Duty. The Harley-Davidson package was available on both F-250 and F-350 Crew Cab SRW models. A gasoline engine was no longer offered with the package, instead, a 6.4L Powerstroke turbo diesel was standard. Unique black and dusted copper two-tone leather captains chairs with bar and shield logo, leather-trimmed center console, unique gauge cluster, and embroidered carpeted floor mats rounded out interior features. 20\" wheels, billet-style grille, blacked out headlights, illuminated cab steps, power folding body-color Powerscope mirrors, rubber bed mat with Harley-Davidson logo and special badging were the exterior highlights. The truck could be ordered with two unique exterior themes, a black monochromatic look with bodyside graphics or a black and vintage copper two-tone with chrome dimensional boxside \"Harley-Davidson\" lettering. An Audiophile premium 8-speaker stereo with subwoofer was standard, while a DVD-based navigation system was optional. Rear seat DVD entertainment system with 8\" screen was also optional, but could not be ordered with the power moonroof.\n\nThe Harley-Davidson package returned for 2009 with some changes. For the first time, the Harley-Davidson package was offered on the F-450 DRW pickup. The interior was trimmed in all black leather, instead of the two-tone for 2008. New colors were offered, Black with flame tape stripes, Black with Vista Blue painted flames or Dark Blue Pearl with Vista Blue painted flames. Ford's \"ToughBed\" spray on bedliner and a rearview camera were made options.\n\nFor 2010, only minor changes were made. Dark Blue Pearl was deleted from the color options in favor of Black with Tuxedo Black painted flames and the rearview camera was made standard. 2010 was the final year Ford offered a Harley edition Super Duty.\n\n2009-2010 A special Cabela’s edition was available in the Crew Cab FX4 configuration. It featured special leather interior with Cabela’s logos embroidered in the seats, custom two tone paint options, a locking centre console, and a locking firearm storage under the rear seats.\n\nThe same two gas engines are carried over and rated exactly the same from the 2nd generation. The 3-valve V8 SOHC is standard. The 3-valve V10 SOHC was still a $699 option over the 5.4L V8. The 4-valve Navistar V8 OHV Power Stroke diesel engine was the diesel engine option and was a $6,895 option over the V8.\n\nSome unique points to highlight of the 2008, 2009 & 2010 F-450 with a regular production pickup bed, which was only offered as a chassis cab before. It has 2 available axle ratios of 4.30 and 4.88:1. The F-450 Super Duty with the optional 'High Capacity Trailer Tow Package' increases the GCWR from 26,000 to . Maximum payload is . Maximum towing is (4.88 axle ratio) / (4.30 axle ratio). It comes standard with Crew Cab, long bed, DRW (Dual Rear Wheels), Limited Slip rear axle, 10-lug Forged wheels made by Alcoa, Trailer Tow package, and the TowCommand TBC (Trailer Brake Controller). The only engine offered in the F-450 Super Duty is the 6.4 L V8 Power Stroke Sequential turbo diesel. The F-450 is equipped with a standard 6-speed manual or optional 5-speed TorqShift automatic transmission.\n\nThe Super Duty line received a large exterior upgrade that includes a new, bigger front fascia. Its engines were also upgraded to better compete with the new Silverado HD and Ram HD. Ford stated in the 2011 Chicago Auto Show that the 2011 trucks have the thickest gauge steel frame of any Heavy Duty truck, this was due to frame being the same design that debuted in 1999. The 2011 Ford F-Series Super Duty was awarded Truckin's \"Topline Pulling Power\" award for 2011. It also won Popular Mechanics best workhorse of 2011, and the best \"Gear of the Year\" in the trucks category.\n\nThe F-450 is able to tow and has a maximum payload of . The F350 has a maximum of towing capacity and of payload. Each engine is mated to a 6R140 heavy-duty TorqShift six-speed automatic transmission. The Ford F-250, the F-350 and the F-450 all come with trim levels including the XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, and Platinum.\n\nThe 2nd generation Facelift of the Ford Super Duty Trucks are assembled at Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant, with additional production for other countries in Venezuela and Mexico. In Venezuela the F-350 super duty is offered as a commercial use small truck cutaway featuring a 6.2L V8 gas engine with a 5-speed manual TREMEC transmission TR-4050 with a choice of 4x2 or 4x4 wheel drive. Since 2012 due to government regulations, the Venezuelan F-350 Super Duty is factory equipped to use both natural gas and gasoline. The F-250 super duty was also recently re-introduced in this market after ten years. It is being marketed using the same engine as the Venezuelan F-350, but only with a 6-speed automatic transmission, 4x2 or 4x4 wheel drive option in both single and double cab configurations.\n\nA feature unique to the 2011 Super Duty is the addition of a locking differential. It is only available for the F-250 and SRW F-350 4x4 models with a rear Sterling 10.5 axle. It is a US$390.00 option The diesel F-250 relies on vacuum-boost brakes, while the F-350 relies on Hydro-boost. Both gas versions of the F-250 and SRW F-350 use vacuum-boost. F-250 is a class 2 truck. While the F-350 SRW, F-350 DRW, & F-450 \"pickup\" are class 3. The F-250 and F-350 (SRW & DRW) have 13.66 inch front brakes and 13.39 inch rear brakes. The 2015-2016 F-250 and F-350 have 14.29 inch vented disc brakes on the front and rear axles as an improvement made for these model years. The F-450 \"pickup\" has 14.53 inch front brakes and 15.35 inch rear brakes. The F-450 has a wider track than the F-350. The F-450 remains available in class 4 as a Chassis Cab truck.\n\nThe trucks were once under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for steering failures, but the investigation revealed the failures were driver error and had nothing to do with design.\n\n\nThe 2011 Ford Super Duty is available with either a gas or diesel engine. The gas option is an E85-capable 6.2 L 2-valve SOHC V8, which puts out and of torque under 10,000 lb GVWR, 316 hp and 397 lb/ft of torque over 10,000 GVWR. The diesel is the new 6.7 L Power Stroke V8, producing and of torque. The new engine is an entirely Ford product, unlike previous diesels, therefore reducing development costs and shipping delays. The 6.8-liter V10 was dropped from the regular Super Duty models, however it is still an option with the F-450 and F-550 chassis cabs, mated with a 5-speed automatic transmission.\n\nShortly after the unveiling of the 6.7 L Power Stroke V8, GM unveiled the 2011 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 3500HD with Duramax 6.6-liter turbodiesel V8, making and of torque. Ford quickly responded by boosting the output of the Power Stroke just months after its initial release, to and of torque. For customers who purchased a Super Duty with the original Power Stroke V8, Ford offered a free upgrade at dealerships to the new level of output. Power and torque was increased to and of torque on 2015 models.\n\nNo manual transmission is available in the United States, but in Mexico and Venezuela the F-350 is available with a 5 Speed Manual. Automatic transmission features a manual mode. The diesel engine's transmission optionally features a PTO and is a \"live-drive\" unit. \"Live-drive\" meaning the PTO is directly connected to the engines crankshaft, whereas the GM's Allison 1000 transmission and Ram's Aisin use a torque converter or clutch (depending on being an automatic or manual, respectively).\nOn the 6.7 L diesel engine only, there are 2 separate cooling systems:\nA belt-driven pump mounted low on the driver side circulates the high-temperature coolant, while a separate belt-driven pump mounted higher on the passenger side circulates the low-temperature coolant.\n\nThe F-450 pickup is available only in a single configuration; a crew cab with a dual rear-wheel 8-foot bed. The only powertrain combination is the 6.7 L Powerstroke turbodiesel V8 mated to the six-speed TorqShift automatic transmission. Trims include the XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, and Platinum.\n\n\nThe Ford Chassis cabs were updated using the new 2011 body style. Ford chassis cabs are still rated up to the industry maximum 19,500 pound Gross Vehicle Weight Rating. The Gross Combined weight was upped 2,000 pounds to 35,000 lb maximum; 5,000 pounds greater than the nearest competitor.\n\nOn September 24, 2015, Ford unveiled the 2017 Ford Super Duty line at the 2015 State Fair of Texas. This marks the first all-new Super Duty line since their 1998 debut, the frame is made from 95% high strength steel and the body (like the F-150) is made from high-strength military grade aluminum alloy.\n\nFor the first time since 1999, both the Super Duty and F-150 lines are constructed using the same cab to better compete with GM, Ram and Nissan's HD trucks. In a major departure, the stand-alone front grille and stepped front fenders seen since 1998 were eliminated from the exterior. The 2-bar grille introduced in 2011 was widened, integrating the headlights into its design.\n\nIn a switch to an aluminum-intensive body similar to the F-150, Ford created a potential 700 lbs (318 kg) of weight savings; in spite of the addition of heavier-duty frame and driveline components, the 2017 Super Duty weighs in at up to 350 lbs (159 kg) less than comparable 2016 models. Ford strengthened the frame and drivetrain with fortified drive shafts, axles, brakes and the 4WD transfer case. F-250 and F-350 pickups are built on a fully boxed frame; chassis-cab models are produced on a frame boxed up to the rear of the cab and of C-channel design rearward.\n\nFor 2017 production, the Super Duty line shares its powertrain lineup with its 2016 predecessor: a 6.2L gasoline V8, 6.8L V10 (F-450 and above), with a 6.7L diesel V8 available in all versions. The 6.2L gasoline V8 engine remains at 385 hp but torque rises from 405 lb-ft to 430 lb-ft. Additionally, the gasoline V8 produces its max torque at over 700 rpm less than the previous 405 lb-ft engine. The 6.7L diesel engine also remains at the same 440 hp (323 kW) but torque increases from 860 lb-ft upwards to 925 lb-ft. The diesel engine now produces its peak torque at 1,800 rpm instead of the previous 1,600 rpm. The F-250 receives a TorqShift-G six-speed automatic while all other Super Duty trucks are paired with the 6R140 6-speed automatic. Crew Cab models will have a 34-gallon (128l) tank for the 6.75-foot bed and 48-gallon fuel tank for the 8-foot bed.\n\nThe interior design of the all-new Super Duty is similar to that of the 2015 Ford F-150, and shares many of the F-150's components.\n\nTrim levels will continue to be XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, and Platinum. The Limited trim would not debut for F-250 and F-350 until 2018. Cab configurations continue to be 2-Door Regular Cab, 4-Door Super Cab, and 4-Door Super Crew Cab (the F-450, in pickup truck configuration, is only available in this configuration), with Short Box (6' 9\") and Long Box (8') bed lengths. The truck will be available in F-250, F-350, and F-450 pickup truck models, and F-350, F-450, and F-550 chassis cab models. All will be available in both 4X2 and 4X4 configurations. The F-350 will be the only model available in either Single Rear Wheel (SRW) or Dual Rear Wheel (DRW) configurations, the F-450 and F-550 will only be available in a Dual Rear Wheel (DRW) configuration, and the F-250 will only be available in a Single Rear Wheel configuration. Base prices in the U.S. range from $32,535 (F-250 XL) to $77,125 (F-450 Platinum). Full pricing is available on the manufacturer's website.\n\nThe 2018 F-450 was the first $100,000 pickup truck, with the addition of the new Limited trim, which debuted on the Ford F-150.\n\nAll engines will be paired with a \"TorqShift\" 6-speed automatic transmission, with the gasoline engines featuring 2 transmissions: 5-speed manual transmission (Chassis Cab F-350 Mexico Market only), Ford's all-new \"TorqShift-G\" automatic transmission.\n\nThe Super Duty will be available in eleven exterior color options.\n\nOn April 4, 2017, all Ford F-250 Super Duty trucks built between October 1, 2015 to April 1, 2017 were recalled due to the risk of improper and damaged rods in the parking brake and transmission allowing the truck to move while in park. This affected 52,000 trucks but no injuries or accidents were reported.\n\nThe 2020 Super Duty debuted at the 2019 Chicago Auto Show in February. It features a revised grille and tailgate design, new wheel options, and higher-quality interior materials for the Limited trim. A new 7.3-liter gasoline engine is available. Nicknamed \"Godzilla\", it earns the title in size and in output, making 430 horsepower and 475 lb-ft of torque. The 6.7-liter Power Stroke engine has been strengthened, bumping output to 475 horsepower and a pavement-twisting 1,050 lb-ft of torque. Ford's 10-speed automatic transmission finally arrives for the Super Duty. The 6-speed is still available, but only for the F-250 with the 6.2-liter engine. Per customer request, the F-250's ride height has been decreased by two inches. Ride height in the F-350 and F-450 are unchanged.\n\nFor 2020, Ford is reintroducing the F-600, a name that was last used in the late 1990s on a medium-duty truck. Based on the F-550 Super Duty, the F-600 Medium Duty will feature the body and cab of a traditional Super Duty Chassis Cab, with upgrades to the chassis over and above the F-550. The F-600 chassis upgrades include upsized U joints, an alteration to the exhaust system to accommodate dynamic clearances for the larger U joint crosses, upgraded brakes, wider wheels (6.75\" instead of 6\") to support wider tires (245mm instead of 225mm) for increased tire load capacity. Geared towards fleet buyers who require the GVWR capacity of the heavier F-650 Medium Duty, though prefer the size and maneuverability of the smaller F-550 Super Duty. Available with either a 7.3L \"Godzilla\" gasoline V8 engine, or the 6.7L Powerstroke Turbodiesel V8 engine, paired with the \"TorqShift\" 10-speed automatic transmission and two-wheel-drive (4X2) or four-wheel-drive (4X4), the F-600 Medium Duty will go on sale in the middle of 2020.\n\nFor 2020, Ford reintroduces the Tremor name for the F-250 and F-350 Super Duty pickups. The nameplate was last used on the 2014 Ford F-150 as a sport appearance package. As an off-road oriented version of the F-250 and F-350 Super Duty, the Tremor models will compete directly with the Ram 2500 Power Wagon, and will feature a suspension lift and upgraded tires and wheels from the factory. The trucks will also offer details not found on other Super Duty models, such as blacked out accents on the front grille, wheels, side emblems, and side mirrors, as well as 'Tremor' decals on the sides of the pickup box. Offered as a SuperCrew Cab model with a six-foot pickup box, and with four-wheel-drive (4X4), the Tremor will be equipped with the new 7.3L \"Godzilla\" gasoline V8 engine, while the 6.7L Powerstroke Turbodiesel V8 engine will be optional (the Ram 2500 Power Wagon only offers a gasoline V8 engine). The trucks will come equipped with 35 inch tall off-road tires, eighteen-inch matte black-painted alloy wheels, and a new 10-speed \"TorqShift\" automatic transmission. Crawl ratios will be 53:1 for gasoline-equipped models, while the ratio for diesel-equipped models will be 44:1. The trucks will be able to ford water up to 33 inches deep, and will feature up to 10.8 inches of ground clearance. Another new feature for all Super Duty models (including the Tremor), is the Trailer Reverse Guidance System, which is similar to the Pro Trailer Backup Assist system in the Ford F-150, and allows for the driver to easily back their truck up to a trailer with little effort. The all-new 2020 Ford F-250 and F-350 Super Duty Tremor models went on sale in the Fall of 2019.\n\nIn 2000, Ford returned to the Class 6-7 truck market as it expanded the Super Duty line into the medium-duty segment. They developed a joint venture with Navistar International known as Blue Diamond Trucks, the F-650 and F-750 Super Duty were assembled in Mexico. While the chassis and other components would be common to both manufacturers, Ford and International would each source their own bodywork and powertrain; the cab for the Ford trucks would be common with other Super Duty models.\n\nFor the 2016 model year, the medium-duty truck range was given a major upgrade, following the end of the joint venture and the shift of the production to the United States. In place of outsourced engines and transmissions, the 2016 F-650 and F-750 now use a 6.8L gasoline V10, a 6.7L PowerStroke diesel V8, and a 6-speed automatic transmission all supplied by Ford.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2005, the F-250 Super Duty served as a basis for the Ford Excursion sport-utility vehicle. Along with Chevrolet Suburban (and its Cadillac/GMC/Holden counterparts) and the International Harvester Travelall, the Ford Excursion was one of the longest non-limousine sport-utility vehicles ever sold.\n\nThe Excursion was available in three trim packages, XLT, Limited, and top-of-the-line Eddie Bauer. It was offered in two or four wheel drive, and with three engine options: the 5.4L V8, the 6.8L V10, or the Powerstroke V8 Turbodiesel. The Excursion was only available with an automatic transmission.\n\nWhile the Excursion was sold mostly in North America and Mexico, a similar vehicle was sold in Brazil from 1998 to 2012 as a second-party conversion of the Ford F-250 crew-cab (similar to the Centurion F-Series/Bronco conversions).\n\nAs a result of the heavy-duty frame and powertrain of its chassis, the Ford Super Duty has served as a donor platform for multiple types of armored vehicles, for civilian, law enforcement, and military use. Most versions are constructed using the Ford F-550 chassis cab. Examples include the Didgori-2, Lenco BearCat, Plasan Sand Cat, GAV Gurkha, APC Novator, and Conquest Knight XV.\n\n"}

His parents were landed gentry so he was well educated. He trained as a solicitor and became an attorney to His Majesty's Courts in Ireland. In 1809 he was charged with forging a bill of exchange, and he was convicted and sentenced to death. He pleaded for clemency and either his family influence or his conversion to Christianity saw him gaoled for 18 months until he was transported to Sydney. The chaplain sent with him to Australia a letter to Reverend Samuel Marsden that said, \"Edward Eagar has really become a new creature.\"\n\nThe ship \"Providence\" arrived in Sydney in 1811 and Eagar was assigned to teach children. He soon commenced Bible classes in the Windsor district. He was then given charge of the local school. In 1812 he met with two newcomers, Thomas Bowden and John Hoskin, and they formed the first membership of the first Methodist church in Australia, known as Wesley Mission, on 12 March 1812. Eagar wrote to the Methodist Conference in England to \"send us a Minister lest we die in our sins\". The Minister, Reverend Samuel Leigh, arrived in 1815, and Eagar introduced him to Governor Macquarie. Reverend Leigh was the first Methodist minister in Australia, and he is remembered by the Leigh Memorial Church in Parramatta. Leigh was formerly remembered in the name of the Methodist Theological College, Leigh College, at Strathfield South, New South Wales (now closed – see Leigh College article) and, with its absorption into the new United Theological College at North Parramatta, New South Wales, he is now remembered in the Leigh Theological Library of the Centre for Ministry which houses the college.\n\nEagar assisted in founding the Sydney Benevolent Society, and subsequently the Royal Women's Hospital at Paddington, the British and Foreign Bible Society, and the Australian Religious Tract Society. He established the Society for the Protection and Civilisation of Distressed Islanders of the South Seas. He also planned the first mission to Aboriginal Australians. He also put up 10 per cent of the funding capital to establish the Bank of New South Wales, now known as Westpac, but he was angry that he was not allowed to become a director of the bank because he had been a convict.\n\nIn 1818 Eagar was granted a full pardon. However, Judge Jeffery Hart Bent did not let him forget he had been a convict and had been discarded from practice as a lawyer. He lost a court case because pardoned convicts did not have a right to own property, to sue, to give evidence in court or to have other civil rights. Other emancipated convicts also saw their rights denied. So Eagar took up their case with the British Government. He fought for trial by jury and for freedom to trade commercially. This was the first Australian attempt to change government policy. Dr William Redfern, after whom the Sydney suburb of Redfern is named, and Edward Eagar sailed to London in 1821 to argue the case in the Court of St. James's on behalf of other emancipated convicts. Eagar fought the case for 20 years, and eventually won.\n\nEagar was Australia's first liberal political agitator. He left his wife and three sons behind, taking his daughter with him to London. He was never to return. He married a 16-year-old girl and they had 10 children. His Sydney wife, Jemima, moved into a new house in Macquarie Street, just down the road from Parliament House, with William Wentworth, with whom she had a son. At the time Wentworth was arguably Australia's most famous citizen. He was the first 'European' to cross the Blue Mountains and the most powerful member of the Legislative Council. Eagar's son Geoffrey became the first accountant of the Bank of New South Wales, a leading public servant, a member of the Legislative Council and eventually Treasurer of New South Wales—described as the best Treasurer of the nineteenth century—and a long-serving Cabinet Minister.\n\nThe Wesley Mission's Edward Eagar Lodge in Surry Hills is named after Edward.\n\n"}

It includes two separate active sonar systems to detect and classify mine-like objects on the surface, in the volume, or on the bottom of the sea. The sonar systems are packaged in a single towed body tethered to the ship through a cable providing power and data transmission, with the cable length variable via an electric winch. A hole in the ship extending from the sonar maintenance room (SMR) to the hull allows movement of the towed body in different configurations for maintenance, stowage at sea, and minehunting operations. The towed body can be configured for minehunting by either locking to the bottom of the ship's hull for shallow water operations, or by extending and retracting the tow cable to allow for variable depth sonar (VDS) operations. VDS operations are necessary in deep water due to refraction of the sonar from the various temperature layers present in the ocean; with the sonar positioned in the same thermal layer as the suspected mines the error induced by refraction is minimized. The detect and classify sonar subsystems are independently monitored and controlled by two operators at independent panels working together to find and characterize underwater objects as mine or non-mine like objects.\n\nThe SQQ-32 system became operational in 1990 and is currently installed on all mine countermeasures ships in the \"Avenger\" class and was previously installed on the \"Osprey\" class before decommissioned.\n\nThe detect system is a low frequency, low resolution, high range sonar designed to provide a general location of possible mine-like objects. It provides much greater range than the classify sonar system but provides little resolution and detail of the objects it detects. It provides the operator 180 degrees of selectable coverage via electronic switching of sonar stave arrays circling the towed body. The newest AN/SQQ-32(V)4 upgrade contracted in 2011 includes a high frequency wide band (HFWB) modification that greatly improves shallow-water minehunting capabilities in high clutter environments.\n\nThe classify sonar has a lower range, but higher frequency and higher resolution to allow the classification of a target as mine-like or non mine-like. Once a target is located by the detect operator, they will hand off the position to the classify operator where they will analyze the characteristics of the object to make a determination if it has mine-like properties. Characteristics include approximate size and shape measurements, ringing patterns caused by metallic objects, and aspect changes as the ship and towed body circle the target.\n\nThe AN/SQQ-32(V)4 system upgrade was designed and tested by Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City and The University of Texas Applied Research Laboratory, and contracted to BAE systems for installation. The initial contract was for installation on four MCM-1 Avenger class minesweepers for $14 million, and later an available option was awarded to upgrade an additional ten units plus a battle spare.\n\n"}

People of the Middle Ages consciously drew from the cultural legacies of the ancient world in shaping their institutions and ideas, and so allegory in medieval literature and medieval art was a prime mover for the synthesis and transformational continuity between the ancient world and the \"new\" Christian world.\n\nPeople of the Middle Ages did not see the same break between themselves and their classical predecessors that modern observers see; rather, they saw continuity with themselves and the ancient world, using allegory as a synthesizing agent that brings together a whole image.\n\nFor most medieval thinkers there were four categories of interpretation (or meaning) used in the Middle Ages, which had originated with the Bible commentators of the early Christian era.\n\n\nThus the four types of interpretation (or meaning) deal with past events (literal), the connection of past events with the present (typology), present events (moral), and the future (anagogical).\n\nDante describes interpreting through a \"four-fold method\" (or \"allegory of the theologians\") in his epistle to Can Grande della Scala. He says the \"senses\" of his work are not simple, but:\n\nMedieval allegory began as a Christian method for synthesizing the discrepancies between the Old Testament and the New Testament. While both testaments were studied and seen as equally divinely inspired by God, the Old Testament contained discontinuities for Christians—for example the Jewish kosher laws. The Old Testament was therefore seen in relation to how it would predict the events of the New Testament, in particular how the events of the Old Testament related to the events of Christ's life. The events of the Old Testament were seen as part of the story, with the events of Christ's life bringing these stories to a full conclusion. The technical name for seeing the New Testament in the Old is called \"typology\".\n\nOne example of typology is the story of Jonah and the whale from the Old Testament. Medieval allegorical interpretation of this story is that it prefigures Christ's burial, with the stomach of the whale as Christ's tomb. Jonah was eventually freed from the whale after three days, so did Christ rise from his tomb after three days. Thus, whenever one finds an allusion to Jonah in Medieval art or literature, it is usually an allegory for the burial and resurrection of Christ.\n\nAnother common typological allegory is with the four major Old testament prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel. These four prophets prefigure the four Apostles Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. There was no end to the number of analogies that commentators could find between stories of the Old Testament and the New.\n\nThere also existed a tradition in the Middle Ages of \"mythography\"—the allegorical interpretation of pagan myths. Virgil's \"Aeneid\" and Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" were standard textbooks throughout the Middle Ages, and each had a long tradition of allegorical interpretation. \n\nMediaeval philosophers also saw allegory in the natural world, interpreting animals, plants, and even non-living things in books called bestiaries as symbols of Biblical figures and morals. For example, one bestiary compares stags with people devoted to the Church, because (according to medieval zoology) they leave their pastures for other (heavenly) pastures, and when they come to broad rivers (sin) they form in line and each rests its head on the haunches of the next (supporting each other by example and good works), speeding across the waters together.\n\nThe early allegorizing trait in the interpretation of the Hebrew Bible figures prominently in the massive oeuvre of a prominent Hellenized Jew of Alexandria, Philo Judaeus (c. 20 BCE – c. 50 CE), whose allegorical reading of the Septuagint synthesized the traditional Jewish narratives with Platonism. Philo's allegorizing, in which he continued an earlier tradition, had little effect in later Jewish thought, in part because the Jewish culture of Alexandria dispersed by the fourth century.\n\nChristian writers such as Origen (184/185 – 253/254) took up the allegorized interpretations and began to read the Old Testament as a series of prefigurations of the New Testament, in a time when rhetorical training was common, when the classics of mythology were still standard teaching texts, when the Greek and Roman pantheon of gods were still visible forms (if not always fully recognized by the more learned populace), and when the new religions such as Christianity adopted or rejected pagan elements by way of \"allegoresis\" (the study and interpretation of allegory).\n\nPrudentius wrote the first surviving Christian purely allegorical freestanding work, \"Psychomachia\" (\"Soul-War\"), about AD 400. The plot consists of the personified \"good\" virtues of Hope, Sobriety, Chastity, Humility, etc. fighting the personified \"evil\" vices of Pride, Wrath, Paganism, Avarice, etc. The personifications are women, because in Latin words for abstract concepts have feminine grammatical gender; an uninformed reader of the work might take the story literally as a tale of many angry women fighting one another, because Prudentius provides no context or explanation of the allegory.\n\nIn this same period of the early 5th century three other authors of importance to the history of allegory emerged: Claudian, Macrobius and Martianus Capella. Little is known of these authors, even if they were \"truly\" Christian or not, but we do know they handed down the inclination to express learned material in allegorical form, mainly through personification, which later became a standard part of medieval schooling methods.\n\nClaudian's first work \"In Rufinum\" attacked the ruthless Rufinus and would become a model for the 12th century \"Anticlaudianus\", a well known allegory for how to be an upstanding man. As well his \"Rape of Prosperpine\" served up a litany of mythological allegories, personifications, and cosmological allegories.\n\nNeoplatonist commentators used allegory as a rhetorical, philosophical and religious devise in reading Ancient mythology, Homer, and Plato.\n\nMacrobius wrote \"Commentary of the Dream of Scipio\", providing the Middle Ages with the tradition of a favorite topic, the allegorical treatment of dreams.\n\nLastly Martianus Capella wrote \"De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii\" (\"Marriage of Philology and Mercury\"), the title referring to the allegorical union of intelligent learning with the love of letters. It contained short treatises on the \"seven liberal arts\" (grammar, rhetoric, dialectic, geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, music) and thus became a standard textbook, greatly influencing educators and students throughout the Middle Ages.\n\nBoethius, perhaps the most influential author of Late Antiquity, first introduced readers of his work \"Consolation of Philosophy\" to the personified Lady Philosophy, the source of innumerable later personified figures (such as Lady Luck, Lady Fortune, etc.)\n\nAfter Boethius there exists no known work of allegorical literature until the 12th century. Although allegorical thinking, elements and artwork abound during this period, it was not until the rise of the medieval university in the High Middle Ages that sustained allegorical literature appears again.\n\nThe earliest works were by Hugh of St Victor (\"Didascalicon\", 1125), Bernard Silvestris (\"Cosmographia\", 1147), and Alanus ab Insulis (\"Plaint of Nature\", 1170, and \"Anticlaudianus\") who pioneered the use of allegory (mainly personification) for abstract speculation on metaphysics and scientific questions.\n\nThe High and Late Middle Ages saw many allegorical works and techniques. There were four great works from this period.\n\n\n"}

In 1920, five women from Howard University envisioned a sorority that would raise the consciousness of their people, encourage the highest standards of scholastic achievement, and foster a greater sense of unity among its members. These women believed that sorority elitism and socializing overshadowed the real mission for progressive organizations. Since its founding Zeta Phi Beta has historically focused on addressing social causes.\n\nZeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. is a non-profit 501(c)(7) organization that is divided into eight intercontinental regions and 800+ Chapters located in the US, Africa, Europe, Asia and the Caribbean. In 1948, Zeta Phi Beta became the first Greek-letter organization to charter a chapter in Africa (in Monrovia, Liberia).\n\nIn the spring of 1919, during a stroll on the campus of Howard University, Charles Robert Samuel Taylor, member of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, shared with Arizona Cleaver his idea for a new sisterhood; a sister organization to his fraternity. Arizona presented this idea to Pearl Neal, Myrtle Tyler, Viola Tyler, and Fannie Pettie, and a new sisterhood was formed.\n\nArizona Cleaver sought permission from the Howard University administration to establish a new campus sorority. That permission was granted, and on January 16, 1920, the first official meeting was held. The five coeds chose the name Zeta Phi Beta. Phi Beta was taken from Phi Beta Sigma to \"seal and signify the relationship between the two organizations\".\n\nThe newly established Zeta Phi Beta Sorority was given a formal introduction at Whitelaw Hotel by Phi Beta Sigma members Charles Robert Samuel Taylor and A. Langston Taylor. The two Sigma brothers had been a source of advice and encouragement during the establishment of the sorority and throughout its early days.\n\nAlpha Kappa Alpha and Delta Sigma Theta sororities held a \"Welcome to Campus\" reception in the assembly room in Miner Hall, in honor of the new sorority.\n\nLater that year, in December 1920, the sorority held the first boule (convention) with members of Phi Beta Sigma at Howard University. The \"Archon\", the sorority's official magazine was established shortly afterwards. Later Boules were held in many locations across the United States.\n\nZeta Phi Beta was first incorporated on March 30, 1923 in Washington, D.C. by sorority members Myrtle Tyler, Gladys Warrington, Joanna Houston, Josephine Johnson and O. Goldia Smith. The sorority was incorporated by the state of Illinois in 1939.\n\nIn 1923, the first chapter of any black sorority to organize a collegiate chapter in Texas, Theta chapter, was established at Wiley College.\n\nIn 1959, Zeta Phi Beta purchased its current headquarters, located at 1734 New Hampshire Avenue NW on Dupont Circle in Washington, DC.\n\nZeta Phi Beta was the first to charter a chapter in Africa (Monrovia, Liberia). Today, there are also chapters in U.S. Virgin Islands, Jamaica, Bahamas, Japan, Korea, Barbados, Haiti, Germany, Belgium, United Arab Emirates and most recently Trinidad/Tobago.\n\nHeld annually, Zeta Day on the Hill provides an opportunity for Zetas to exercise another level of civic responsibility by learning the protocols for interacting with and the knowledge needed to maximize engagement with congressional representatives. As members of a \"Community Conscious-Action Oriented\" organization, Zetas schedule meetings with their representative or their representative's designee to discuss, during brief sessions, issues of interest to the local, state and national Zeta membership.\n\nOn January 25, 2001, Zeta Phi Beta was granted non-governmental organization (NGO) status with the United Nations.\n\nIn 2005, Zeta Phi Beta completed its $2 million renovation project of the international headquarters. The historic building has served as Zeta's home since its purchase in 1959.\nIn December 2010 the sorority officially partnered with Stevie Wonder to collect toys for his annual House Full of Benefit Concert. All of the sorority's 850 chapters signed on to collect toys for the program.\n\nFollowing a February 5, 2006 news report by WJLA, an ABC affiliated TV station, the U.S.'s Internal Revenue Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation and United States Attorney opened an investigation into alleged financial irregularities occurring in the sorority. The purpose of the investigation was to determine if National President Barbara C. Moore had obtained funds from the tax-exempt organization for personal gain. During the investigation, sorority member and former National Executive Board member, Natasha Stark was expelled for \"violating her duty of loyalty to the sorority, engaging in conduct injurious to the sorority or its purposes, and unsisterly conduct.\" on March 20, 2007, Starks filed a lawsuit with the District of Columbia District Court requesting $1 million in damages. Stark's claims for breach of contract and negligence were dismissed at a September 11, 2008 status conference.\n\nEntertainer Sheryl Underwood was elected as the 23rd International Grand Basileus (President), during the sorority's biennial business meeting in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2008. Her election as Grand Basileus was disputed by some members, but District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Gerald I. Fisher dismissed a lawsuit against the sorority and Underwood, that asked the court to unseat Underwood.\n\nOn July 3, 2008, Lorrie Sinclair filed a Diversity-Breach of Contract suit in the District of Columbia District Court against Zeta Phi Beta demanding $76,000.\n\nIn August 2009, the sorority chapter at Colorado State University was expelled from the campus after disturbing police reports of hazing surfaced.\n\nOn August 12, 2010, Coastal Carolina University, located near Myrtle Beach, SC, suspended its chapter of Zeta Phi Beta sorority for five years after being found in violation of the university's hazing policy, according to a release from CCU. According to information gathered through an investigation by the CCU's Office of Student Conduct, the sorority violated the policy regarding new member processes, the release said. The terms of the suspension encompass all activities, including new member processes, meetings, community service and social events. After the suspension has expired, Zeta Phi Beta may petition CCU to recognize the sorority for the fall 2015 semester.\n\nIn 2012, a student at University of California at Berkeley sued the sorority after experiencing hazing so bad that she was forced to drop out of school. She was told by members of the sorority that prospective members are not hazed, however she eventually learned that was a lie. In her lawsuit, she stated she had her head slammed into a wall, her pockets ripped from her jeans, she was beat over the head while being forced to recite the sorority's history, forced to clean up juice with only her back, and was subject to other illegal hazing activities.\n\nIn 2014, the sorority at the University of Memphis was given a three-year suspension for physically abusing and harassing pledges. One known pledge's nose was broken after being repeatedly hit in the face by several Zetas. Two Zetas identified in a police report as being extremely abusive towards pledges dropped out the university soon after the suspension was announced.\n\nIn spring of 2016, the sorority at the University of Florida was given a two-year suspension. Shortly after the release of new line members, the university officials received an eight-page letter from one of the pledgie reporting all the hazing incidents that she endured. This chapter suspension ended in March 2018.\n\nThe Amicae group is composed of women who have not obtained a college degree, but wish to assist Zeta Phi Beta members in local activities. Currently there are over 175 Amicae groups in the U.S. The first Amicae group was organized in Omaha, Nebraska in 1947 by the Beta Psi Zeta chapter.\n\nThe Archonettes are composed of young high school-aged ladies (age 14 to 18) who demonstrate an interest in the goals and the ideals of scholarship, sisterly love, and community service. Each Archonette group is affiliated with a local graduate chapter of Zeta Phi Beta.\n\nThe Amicettes are composed of girls age 9 to 13 who are willing to strive toward the high ideals of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority and who demonstrate potential for leadership in service to the community. . Each Amicettes group is affiliated with a local chapter of Zeta Phi Beta.\n\nThe Pearlettes are composed of young girls age 4 to 8. Pearlettes are mentored by members of Zeta Phi Beta to become outstanding leaders in their communities.\n\nThe Zeta Male Network is the title given to the support organization that includes males in the lives of members of Zeta Phi Beta.\n\nThe National Educational Foundation of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. is a 501(c)3 trust organization created in 1975 and operated by Zeta Phi Beta to oversee the sorority's charitable and educational activities. The trust awards scholarship grants, conducts community educational programs and activities, and engages in Foundation scholarship related research.\n\nThe Foundation partnered with Xavier University of New Orleans, The Consumer Health Foundation, the MidAtlantic Cancer Genetics Network, the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus, and The Family Life Center of Shiloh Baptist Church and presented conferences on human genome research in Washington, D. C., Atlanta Georgia, New Orleans, Louisiana, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Chicago, Illinois.\n\nSince 1971, Zeta Phi Beta has enjoyed a partnership with the March of Dimes in an effort to encourage women to seek prenatal care within the first trimester of pregnancy, thereby increasing the prevention of birth defects and infant mortality. Known as the Stork's Nest Program, this collaboration encourages participation and healthy behaviors during the pregnancy through two components - incentives and education. Nationwide, Zeta Phi Beta sponsors over 175 Stork's Nests. In 1997, during the celebration of the 25th anniversary of collaboration with the March of Dimes, the program was updated to include a new national logo, new educational materials, and new incentive items for those mothers participating in the program. As of 2005, the Stork's Nest Program has served over 28,000 women.\n\nThe goal of Z-H.O.P.E.

The change could otherwise be regarded as objectionable if it took place in a single step or short period.\n\nAmerican scientist, Jared Diamond, first coined the phrase \"creeping normality\" in his 2005 book, \"\". Prior to releasing his book, Diamond explored this theory while attempting to explain why, in the course of long-term environmental degradation, Easter Island natives would, seemingly irrationally, chop down the last tree:\n\nThe concept of creeping normality has been used to explain a number of different phenomena, including the examples listed below:\n\nAndrew Hammond, a writer for the \"Gulf News\", invoked the concept in his February 2018 article \"Mass shootings have started to look, sound and feel the same—and that's a problem\". He wrote that mass shootings feature the same coverage of sobbing pairs of people, contemplative witnesses, night-time vigils, and prayer circles, and that there is a familiarity to all of it. Hammond argues that, with the increasing number of major active shooter incidents occurring annually in the United States, the ubiquity of the events has begun producing its own distinctive aesthetic.\n\nAntheaume and Barbelivien described the creeping normality that destroys businesses, causing them to not see the subtle, negative shifts in the community around them. The authors state that owners of family businesses are more likely to notice the small changes than a large corporation, although \"detecting a problem is no guarantee of the ability to solve it\".\n\nIn his thesis, Ki Chon states that the increase in cybercrime fits the pattern for creeping normality. The number of websites involved in \"hacking and cybercrime activities\" has increased at a slow and steady pace, mostly below society's awareness.\n\nPeter Ho referred to creeping normality in his four-part IPS-Nathan lecture series in spring of 2017. In regard to several issues Singapore is facing, he claimed that \"things get just a little bit worse each year than the year before, but not bad enough for anyone to notice\". As an example, he used the increase in flooding in Singapore. He stated that the country did not realize the problem was caused by rising temperatures due to catastrophic climate change and not poor drainage, as first suspected.\n\nResearchers at the University of Central Florida looked into the evolving media landscape on the University's campuses and argued that there has been a gradual shift to offer more online classes, resources, and a technology and media-rich environment. They characterized the \"ubiquitous presence of media and technology\" on campuses as an example of creeping normality.\n\nAlex de Waal has discussed the timescale over which disasters like famine occur. De Waal makes the point that governments and media outlets have a responsibility to recognise the underlying causes of famine and natural disaster, as opposed to focusing on the visibility of the crisis alone. He uses \"landscape amnesia\" to explain how a person or society may be shocked to realize the gradual changes that lead to disaster.\n\nCreeping normality has also been used to describe the increase of maternity patients who are obese and overweight. In their research article, authors Wilkinson, Poad, and Stapleton suggest that as the number of clinically obese or overweight pregnant women increase, the negative stigmatisation with being overweight decreases. Schmeid, et al. state that, as health care providers see more women with an unhealthy weight, they are less likely to advise healthy weight gain goals during pregnancy out of fear of fat-shaming. Physicians may not be aware that they are not addressing the gestational weight gain as soon as necessary. A survey conducted from January to April 2010 of obstetrics and gynecology residents found that of those surveyed, only \"7.6% selected correct BMI ranges for each category, and only 5.8% selected correct gestational weight gain ranges\".\n\nMore recently, in an Australian study published in 2013, researchers surveyed maternity health care providers in Queensland and discovered a lack of knowledge of body mass index (BMI) and body weight guidelines for pregnant women. The lack of guideline knowledge was identified as a barrier to effective care, while the researchers also addressed the social stigma associated communicating guidelines and recommendations for overweight and obese pregnant patients. The study acknowledged that the stigmatisation traditionally associated with excessive weight is increasingly challenged by broader acceptance of overweight and obese people worldwide, something that has occurred slowly. As of 2013, people considered to be of a healthy weight were only 39.40% of the world's population.\n\nAlthough economic crises, such as the European debt crisis, can appear as a sudden and drastic change or anomaly, foreshadowing indicators such as innovation and changing practices that go unnoticed or unheeded illustrate creeping normality in economic change.\n\nThere are a number of metaphors related to creeping normality, including:\n"}

The story centers on the disintegration of an Irish family in Dublin in the early 1920s, during the Irish War of Independence. Juno is a hardworking matriarch who strives to hold her family together in the face of war, betrayal, and her worthless husband's drinking.\n\nThe original production opened on Broadway in 1959 and closed after only 16 performances. Its somber tone did not please the critics, who were disappointed that its stars, particularly Shirley Booth, did not have an opportunity to play comedy. The score and original cast album have found some praise. Several revivals have been staged, but none has met with great success.\n\nDespite light moments, the musical, even more than the satiric play, is essentially a tragedy. Modern scholars of musical theatre consider Blitzstein and Stein's musicalization of the source material to be strong, but initial reviews of the piece were mostly negative, mainly because critics and audiences felt that the story was too dark for a musical. The production closed after only 16 performances. According to Robert Viagas, writing in \"Playbill\", \"The consensus is that the score may have been ahead of its time, especially harmonically.\"\n\n\"Juno\" premiered on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre on March 9, 1959. The original director was originally to have been Tony Richardson, who dropped out of the production during the early stages. Vincent J. Donehue replaced him, but the rest of the creative team were not satisfied with his work. He was then replaced by José Ferrer. Orchestrations were by Blitzstein, with support from Robert Russell Bennett and Hershy Kay. The show was conducted by Robert Emmett Dolan and choreographed by Agnes de Mille. The production starred Shirley Booth (as Juno Boyle), Melvyn Douglas (as Captain Boyle), Jack MacGowran (as Joxer), and Tommy Rall (as Johnny Boyle), with a cast that also included Loren Driscoll, Monte Amundsen, Nancy Andrews, Jean Stapleton and Sada Thompson.\n\nRevivals of \"Juno\" have since been attempted several times with little success, with revisions and new material by Richard Maltby, Jr. and severely reduced orchestrations. \"Juno\" was presented at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in 1974, in a \"New Adaptation by Richard Maltby Jr. & Geraldine Fitzgerald and with Additional Lyrics by Richard Maltby Jr.\" and starred Fitzgerald as the title character and Milo O'Shea as Captain Jack Boyle.\n\nThe musical was produced Off-Broadway by the Vineyard Theatre in 1992, directed by Lonny Price and featuring Anita Gillette and Malcolm Gets. \"The New York Times\" reviewer wrote: \"Despite alterations, the musical has not markedly improved in its newly revised version. ... The savage ironies of that scene are not evoked in other aspects of the musical, which focuses on the latent sentimentality within the family relationships and the comic interplay among the characters. On the most immediate level, Mr. Blitzstein's music wavers in its claim to an Irish lilt. The lyrics often resort to banalities and occasionally to doggerel. Repeatedly, the show overlooks the opportunity to take off from the playwright's words. The score is unworthy of both O'Casey and Mr. Blitzstein, the composer of \"The Cradle Will Rock\" and \"Regina\"\".\n\nNew York City Center's Encores! presented a semi-staged concert production of \"Juno\" in March 2008 directed by Garry Hynes, starring Victoria Clark and John Schuck using the original orchestrations. Critical response was more favorable after nearly fifty years, with praise for the score and performances. Ben Brantley, in his review for \"The New York Times\", wrote that the score \"translates Irish folk vernacular into a style that is part Broadway perkiness, part 20th-century-opera anxiety. And under the direction of Eric Stern, the Encores! orchestra fully evokes this intriguing ambivalence. Even the most buoyant love songs and ensemble numbers are inflected with an underlying grimness, as if hope could never be expected to fly free in the rotting tenements of Dublin. It feels right that the show’s prettiest number, a madrigal, is about a bird trapped in its nest. ... Ms. Clarks's Juno is the other principal reason to see this production.\"\n\n\nBlitzstein's score was preserved by Columbia Records, which released the original cast album in both monaural and stereo editions. The Fynsworth Alley label re-released the recording on compact disc in 2002. Steven Suskin, in his review in \"Playbill\", noted: \"Time and again in the score, I sense that Blitzstein is reminding himself to write Irish music – and that hampers his creativity. The score ranges from exceptional to mundane; the weaker portions make it very clear to us, today, that \"Juno\" simply couldn't have worked. There have been at least three major attempts at 'fixing' the show, in the same way that Bernstein's \"Candide\" was 'fixed'.\"\n\n"}

His early training was with Giovan Battista della Cerva in Milan. He painted a large \"Allegory of the Lenten Feast\" for \"San Agostino\" in Piacenza (1567). Other works by his hand include an elaborate dome with \"Glory of Angels\" for the Capella Foppa in San Marco in Milan, and the \"Fall of Simon Magus\" in the wall of the chapel. \n\nHe was admired as an artist and in 1562 was depicted on a medallion by Annibale Fontana which described him as having been introduced by Mercury to Fortune (commercial success).\n\nLomazzo became blind in 1571, and turned to writing, producing two complex treatises that are milestones in the development of art criticism. His first work, \"Trattato dell'arte della pittura, scoltura et architettura\" (1584) is in part a guide to contemporary concepts of decorum, which the Renaissance inherited in part from Antiquity, which controlled a consonance between the functions of interiors and the kinds of painted and sculpted decors that would be suitable. Lomazzo offered a systematic codification of esthetics typical of the increasingly formalized and academic approaches prevalent during the later sixteenth century and has been described as a central figure in the development of Italian mannerist theories.\n\nLomazzo's less practical and more metaphysical \"Idea del tempio della pittura\" (\"The ideal temple of painting\", 1590) offers a description along the lines of the \"four temperaments\" theory of human nature and personality, containing the explanations of the role of individuality in judgment and artistic invention.\n\nLomazzo's criticism took into account three aspects of art criticism: \"doctrina\", the record of discoveries— such as perspective— that artists had made in the course of history; \"prattica\", the personal preferences and \"maniera\" of the artist, and iconography, the literary element in arts. Lomazzo’s contribution to art criticism was his systematic extraction of abstract concepts from art, not merely a recounting of the marvels of verisimilitude and technique and anecdotes of the works' reception among contemporaries of the type that Giorgio Vasari had reported in the previous generation.\n\nDavid Piper quotes his influential views on portraiture: \n\nGiovanni Ambrogio Figino, Cristoforo Ciocca, and Girolamo Ciocca were his pupils.\n\n\n"}

He married Lady Jean Gordon, daughter of Lewis Gordon, 3rd Marquess of Huntly and Mary Grant, about 6 July 1682.\n\nLike his father, James was a Jacobite, and he joined the rising led by Viscount Dundee in 1689. James was Dundee's cavalry commander for most of the rising, and he led a troop of horse at the Battle of Killiecrankie in July 1689. After Dundee's death at the battle, James stayed with the rising as one of its senior figures until mid-1690. In the same year, he was outlawed and forfeited his estates and title. He then joined the deposed James VII at St. Germains, who conferred on him the Order of the Thistle. In 1694 James Seton died with no issue, thereby ending the earldom of Dunfermline. His prominent role in the 1689 rising, as an Earl and a member of the Scottish Privy Council, helps to disprove claims by some historians that Viscount Dundee's rising attracted no noble support other than Dundee himself.\n"}

It is the largest of what are commonly called \"mini-macaws\". The belly has a large maroon patch which gives the species its name.\n\nIt is endemic to tropical Amazonian South America, from Colombia and Trinidad south to Amazonian Peru and Bolivia, and central Brazil as far as the northwestern cerrado. Its habitat is moriche (or buriti) palm (\"Mauritia flexuosa\") swamp forests and sandy savannahs with palm groves. They are critically dependent on the Moriche palm for roosting, feeding and nesting. Although the bird is locally common, in places it has been adversely affected by clearing of the palms for use as posts, or to allow cattle ranching; also by capture for the pet trade.\n\nNot to be confused with the African red-bellied parrot (\"Poicephalus rufiventris\"), a similarly named smaller parrot.\n\nThe red-bellied macaw was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his \"Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux\" from a specimen collected in Cayenne, French Guiana. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the \"Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle\" which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name \"Psittacus manilatus\" in his catalogue of the \"Planches Enluminées\". The red-bellied macaw is now the only species placed in the genus \"Orthopsittaca\" that was introduced by the American ornithologist Robert Ridgway in 1912. The species is monotypic. The generic name combines the Ancient Greek \"orthos\" meaning \"straight\" and \"psittakē\" meaning \"parrot\". The specific epithet combines the Latin \"manus\" meaning \"hand\" and \"latus\" meaning \"broad\" or \"wide\".\nThe red-bellied macaw is medium-sized, about in weight and about in length including its long pointed tail. The plumage is mostly green; the cere and much of the face are covered with bare mustard-yellow skin, and the irises are dark brown. The forehead is bluish. The chin, throat and upper chest are greyish with some green scalloping, and the lower abdomen (\"belly\") has a large maroon patch. The tail is long and tapered. The underwings and undertail are dull olive yellow. Adults have dark-grey beaks. The legs and feet are dark grey. In common with other parrots, they have zygodactyl feet, two toes pointing forward and two backward. Males and females have identical plumage, but males are usually larger and have larger heads. Juveniles are duller in colour than adults and have a grey beak with a conspicuous white mid-line stripe running along the length of the culmen (top of the upper beak). The Spix's macaw is the only other macaw in which juveniles have a similar white culmen.\n\nThe red-bellied macaw has an extremely large range throughout the Amazon Basin of the North Region, Brazil, except in the northwest quadrant centered on a large region of the Rio Negro flowing from Colombia-Venezuela. It ranges through the Guianas including the Guiana Highlands into eastern Venezuela, the lower Orinoco River Basin and across to the island of Trinidad.\n\nIts southern limit in Brazil is the south-central and northwestern cerrado bordering the Amazon Basin.\n\nRed-bellied macaws make reedy, high-pitched screams. They roost communally in the moriche palms, and large numbers can be seen at the roost sites at dawn and dusk; (see crepuscular). They choose large stands of these palms that have an overabundance of woodpecker holes as roosting sites. They sleep communally in these groups of hollows. Depending on the size of the hollow, between five and 10 birds sleep together. As dusk approaches, they all pile into these dormitories and sleep shoulder to shoulder.\n\nRed-bellied macaws nest in cavities of dead moriche palm trees. There are usually two to four white eggs in a clutch. The female incubates the eggs for about 27 days, and the chicks fledge from the nest about 77 days after hatching. Juveniles reach sexual maturity in 2–3 years.\n\nTheir diet consists almost exclusively of the fruit and seeds of moriche palm, which are 100% carbohydrate, 0% fat and very high in Beta-carotene.\n\nRed-bellied macaws are listed as \"least concern\" by the IUCN. Population numbers have not been estimated, but wild populations seem to be declining.\n\nIt is extremely difficult keep these birds alive in captivity, because of their high strung personality, and low fat and high carbohydrate diet. Export/Import for the pet trade often results in 100% mortality. Captive-bred chicks have a low survival rate.\n\nThe only country to export these birds in recent years is Guyana.\n\nBecause of lack of commercial availability of moriche palm nuts, shelled unsalted peanuts have been used as a staple in the diet of captive birds. They must not be fed commercial bird seed, especially fatty seed like Sunflower.\n\n\n\n"}

Each is assigned a color, as follows:\nThe Red Line has two branches, in the south, called by their terminals - Ashmont and Braintree. Additionally, the Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line, a streetcar line to Mattapan, is also colored red. Some trains use the letters A, B and C for Ashmont, Braintree and Alewife (the north terminal) respectively.\n\nThe Green Line is a streetcar/light rail system with four branches to the west, labeled \"B\" to \"E\" from north to south. The trains operate underground in the downtown area; outside of downtown, all but the \"D\" branch run along city streets, with frequent grade crossings at intersections. Rollsigns and newer electronic signs use the following labels:\n\nUntil 1965, the lines were called by their names:\n\nThey were also known by various numbers, used only on maps (see below for more details), as part of an integrated system of rapid transit, streetcars and buses:\n\nAfter taking over operations in August 1964, the MBTA began rebranding many elements of Boston's public transportation network. On August 26, 1965, the four rapid transit lines were assigned colored names related to their history and geography. The Red Line was named for Harvard University's crimson branding, the Blue Line for passing under Boston Harbor and along Revere Beach, the Green Line for running along the Emerald Necklace, and the Orange Line for running under a section of Washington Street originally known as Orange Street. When designing the rebranding, Cambridge Seven Associates originally planned for yellow instead of orange, but yellow was rejected after testing.\n\nOn August 26, 1965, the current colors were assigned. The Green Line branches were lettered \"A\" to \"E\" in 1967, ending the use of map numbers for the remaining rail routes. The \"A\" Branch was discontinued in 1969, before lettered rollsigns were ever used on the line. As cars were interchangeable between the Green Line and Ashmont-Mattapan Line, rollsigns also included the letter \"F\" for Mattapan service, but this was later changed to \"M\". \n\nOn some later rollsigns, short-turn trips were displayed with a slash through the letter. This use included:\nMany rollsigns only use the letters for outbound trips, with no letters next to downtown destinations. When the letters were first applied, the inbound destinations all used letters.\n\nThe Red Line branches were initially assigned letters in 1968 - \"A\" for Quincy/South Braintree and \"C\" for Ashmont. At the time, a branch to Brockton was being planned, which might have gotten the letter \"B\". These letters were never used much, and never appeared on maps, and newer rollsigns omitted them. In 1994 the current letter coding was assigned with new cars.\n\nBus routes are assigned numbers, which are displayed on maps and buses. Generally, the numbers increase from South Boston clockwise to East Boston. Numbers above 202 are used by outlying routes, assigned by region as follows:\n\nThe Silver Line Phase I (Washington Street) service have SL4 & SL5. SL5 to Downtown Crossing is internally the 749, as it replaced the 49. The SL4 to South Station is internally 751. The branches of Phase II (South Boston Waterfront) are assigned labels SL1, SL2, and SL3. Shuttles running only to Silver Line Way are not labeled. Internally, the shuttle is 746, and the branches are SL1 as 746.1 or 741 to Logan Airport in East Boston , SL2 as 746.2, or 742 to Design Center in South Boston, and SL3 as 743 to Chelsea.\n\nThe two (formerly three) crosstown routes are publicly assigned CT1 to CT3. Internally, they too are given 700-series numbers, based on a parallel route. The former CT1 mostly ran the same route as the 1, so it was the 701. Part of the CT2 parallels the 47, so that part is the 747, and a more recent extension is the 748 (always through-routed). The CT3, paralleling the 8, is the 708, and the former extension was the 709.\n\nNight Owl buses were assigned in the 700 series as well (with a suffix of N). Night Owl buses that replaced other buses were given the normal bus number with N.\n\nAdditionally, several private bus companies are subsidized by the MBTA. Some of those are assigned numbers from 710 to 716.\n\nThe first numbers used were implemented with Hunter sign boxes, approximately from 1911 to 1917. Numbers were three digits, with the first referring to the division. In 1918, the network was substantially reorganized, and numbers were no longer used. However, from then until 1967, a similar four-digit system was used internally.\n\nNumbers resembling the current system were first assigned on the 1936 map. However, until the 1942 edition, the numbers changed with each new printing as routes were added and removed. In addition, these routes were only used on the map, not even on schedules. From 1942 on, the numbers generally remained the same, with a minor renumbering in 1967 prior to implementing the numbers on rollsigns and schedules.\n\nAs the MBTA began to take over suburban bus systems, it assigned them numbers in higher ranges.\n\nThe Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway's buses were taken over on March 30, 1968, and numbers were assigned as follows:\n\nThe Middlesex and Boston Street Railway buses were subsidized by the MBTA in September 1964, and they were assigned numbers from 20 to 36 (extended to 39 in November 1967, on the takeover of routes from Transit Bus Lines), duplicating existing MBTA numbers. The MBTA took over the M&B on June 30, 1972, and added a 5 in front. The routes were given unused numbers from 52 to 76 in September 1982, and in 1996 the ones operating express to downtown Boston via the Mass Pike were again assigned a 5 in front.\n\n"}

{"id": "1957559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957559", "title": "Ancient Greek clubs", "text": "Ancient Greek clubs\n\nAncient Greek clubs (, \"hetaireiai\") were associations of ancient Greeks who were united by a common interest or goal.\n\nThe earliest reference of clubs in ancient Greece appears in the law of Solon, which is quoted in the \"Digest\" of Justinian I (47.22). This law guaranteed the administrative independence of such associations if they kept within the bounds of the law.\n\nThe \"Digest\" mentions these associations for religious practices, burial, trade, privateering, and communal meals. It also mentions demes, citizen groups based on subdivisions of land, and phratries, kinship groups. Other than this law, information about the clubs have been found primarily on inscriptions, including those related to burial practices and common meals.\n\nDuring the time span of 448 and 431 BC, that is between the end of Persian Wars and the start of the Peloponnesian War, there were political clubs called \"hetairiai\", within both the oligarchic and democratic parties. Supposed members included: Themistocles, a leader in the Athenian democracy, (Plut. \"Anistides,\" 2); Pericles, a statesman, orator, and general of Athens, (Plut. \"Per.\" 7 and 13); Cimon, an Athenian statesman and general, who had a hundred club member, \"hetairoi\", following him (Plut. \"Cim.\" 17). The purpose of these associations was to secure favourable results at elections and in the courts (Thuc. viii. 54). At this time their actions were not regarded as harmful or illegal by ancient Greek society.\n\nThe bitterness of party struggles in Greece during the Peloponnesian War meant that in many states they became a threat to local constitutions, and to democratic institutions. Aristotle mentions (\"Politics,\" p. 1310 a) a secret oath taken by the members of oligarchic clubs, containing the promise, \"I will be an enemy to the people, and will devise all the harm I can against them.\" At Athens, the Athenian coup of 411 BC, a conspiracy against their democracy was engineered, in part, by these clubs, which existed there and in the other cities of the Delian League (Thuc. viii. 48 and 54). This is an example of how some of these political clubs had become secret conspiracies working outside the constitution.\n\nAncient Greek religious clubs focused on the worship of a particular deity and had several names including \"thiasoi, eranoi\" and \"orgeones,\". The \"thiasi\" and \"orgeones\" clubs were often connected with deities foreign to the area and whose rites were of an orgiastic nature. These were deities that were not formally recognised and guaranteed by the state which meant no state provision was made for their worship.\n\nPrivate individuals or groups had to provide priests, temples, sacrifices for non-state deities and this was purpose of many of the religious clubs. The state, as the law of Solon shows, had no problem with the introduction of worship of foreign deities provided it did not infringe the law and was not morally unwholesome. These religious clubs had all the rights of legal corporations.\n\nThere were clubs supporting the cults of foreign deities such as Sabazius, Mater Magna (see Great mother of the gods) and Attis, Adonis, Isis, Serapis, Men Tyrannos. These were especially prevalent in seaports like the Peiraeus, Rhodes, Smyrna. A passage in Demosthenes (\"de Corona,\" sect. 259 foll.) shows that the initiation at an early age in the rites of Sabazius did not gain credit for Aeschines in the eyes of the \"best men\". The members of these religious clubs included women, freedmen, foreigners and slaves but rarely people who held citizenship by birth. An inscription found by Sir Charles Thomas Newton at Cnidus contains a mutilated list of members of a \"thiasos\" includes apparently only one Cnidian citizen out of twelve, four slaves, and probably seven foreigners. This would suggest that it was the foreign population in the cities of Greece that tended to participate in this type of religious club.\n\nMuch of the evidence for the organisation of religious clubs comes from inscriptions from Greece. The religious associations took on organizational forms in imitation of the constitution of the city in which they were based. The clubs had laws, an assembly and magistrates or officers (typically epimeletai, a tamias (treasurer) and a secretary (grammateus)), as well as priests or priestesses, and organised finances.\n\nRules regulated the conditions of admission, which involved an entrance fee and an examination as to character; the contributions, payable by the month, and the steps to be taken to enforce payment, e.g. exclusion in case of persistent neglect of this duty. Rules also governed the use to be made of the revenues, such as the building or maintenance of temple or club-house, and the cost of crowns or other honours voted by the assembly to its officers.\n\nThis assembly, in accordance with the law, elected its officers once a year, and these, like those of the state itself, took an oath on entering office, and gave an account of their stewardship at the end of the year. For further information on the organization of these clubs, see Le Guen (who examines epigraphic evidence for an organisation known as the 'Dionysian Technites'), or Foucart (who discusses the 'orgeones' for the cult of the Mother of the Gods at the Peiraeus). Foucart also states that these clubs did not function in any sense as benefit clubs, or offer relief to the sick and needy.\n\nReligious clubs increased in number and importance in the later periods of Greek history, and a large proportion of the inscriptions relating to them belong to the Macedonian and Roman empires. One of the most interesting, found in 1868, belongs to the 2nd century AD and reveals the worship of Men Tyrannos at Laurium (Foucart, pp. 119 foll.). This Phrygian deity was introduced into Attica by a Lycian slave, employed by a Roman in working the mines at Laurium. He founded the cult and the \"eranos\" which was to maintain it, and seems also to have drawn up the law regulating its ritual and government. This may indicate how similar religious clubs were organised earlier in the period.\n\n\n"}

One of the roles she is most known for is her pivotal involvement in gaining woman's suffrage in Italy.\n\nMozzoni was born in Milan in 1837. Early in her career Mozzoni embraced the utopian socialism of Charles Fourier. She later defended the poor and championed women's equality, arguing that women needed to enter the workplace to develop the female personality outside of the \"\"monarcato patriarcale\"\" (patriarchal family). In 1864 she wrote \"Woman and her social relationships on the occasion of the revision of the Italian Civil Code\" (La donna e i suoi rapporti sociali in occasione della revisione del codice italiano), a feminist critique of Italian family law. In 1877 Mozzoni presented a petition to parliament for woman suffrage. In 1878 Mozzoni represented Italy at the International Congress on Women's Rights in Paris. In 1879 she published her translation from English into Italian of \"The Subjection of Women\" by John Stuart Mill. In 1881 Mozzoni joined with other republicans, radicals, and socialists in a call for universal suffrage, including woman suffrage. In 1881 she also founded the League for the Promotion of the Interests of Women (\"Lega promotrice degli interessi femminili\") in Milan to promote a variety of causes of interest to women.\n\nMozzoni died in Rome on 14 June 1920.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1957569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957569", "title": "Associations in ancient Rome", "text": "Associations in ancient Rome\n\nIn ancient Rome, the principle of private association was recognized very early by the state. \"Sodalitates\" for religious purposes are mentioned in the XII Tables, and \"collegia opificum,\" or trade guilds, were believed to have been instituted by Numa Pompilius, which probably means that they were regulated by the \"jus divinum\" as being associated with particular cults.\n\nIt can be difficult to distinguish between the two words \"collegium\" and \"sodalitas\". \"Collegium\" is the wider of the two in meaning, and may be used for associations of all kinds, public and private, while \"sodalitas\" is more especially a union for the purpose of maintaining a cult. Both words indicate the permanence of the object undertaken by the association, while a \"societas\" is a temporary combination without strictly permanent duties.\n\nThe \"collegia opificum\" ascribed to Numa include guilds of weavers, fullers, dyers, shoemakers, doctors, teachers, painters, and other occupations, as listed by Ovid in the \"Fasti\". Ovid says they were in origin associated with the cult of Minerva, the goddess of handiwork. Plutarch mentions flute-players, who were connected with the cult of Jupiter on the Capitol, as well as guilds of smiths, goldsmiths, tanners.\n\nThough these guilds may not have had a religious purpose, like all early institutions they were associated with some religious cult, and in most cases the cult of Minerva. Almost all these \"collegia\" had their religious centre and business headquarters at her temple on the Aventine Hill. When a guild of poets was instituted during the Second Punic War, this too had its meeting-place in the same temple.\n\nThe purpose of the guild in each case was no doubt to protect and advance the interests of the trade, but little information for them exists until the age of Cicero, when they reappear in the form of political clubs (\"collegia sodalicia\" or \"compitalicia\") chiefly with the object of securing the election of candidates for magistracies. The political \"collegia\" were suppressed by a \"senatus consultum\" in 64 BC, revived by Clodius six years later, and finally abolished by Julius Caesar, as dangerous to public order.\n\nThe principle of the trade guild reasserts itself under the Empire, and is found at work in Rome and in every municipal town. Though the right of permitting such associations belonged to the government, these trade guilds were recognized by the state as being instituted \"ut necessariam operam publicis utilitatibus exhiberent\" (\"so that they might perform the necessary work of public 'utilities',\" or useful public works).\n\nEvery kind of trade and business throughout the Empire seems to have had its \"collegium,\" as is shown by the inscriptions collected in the \"Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum\" from any Roman municipal town. These inscriptions provide important evidence for the life and work of the lower orders of the \"municipales\". The primary object was no doubt still to protect the trade, but as time went on they tended to become associations for feasting and enjoyment, and more and more to depend on the munificence of patrons elected with the object of eliciting it. How far they formed a basis or example for the guilds of the early Middle Ages is a difficult question (see Guild). Eventually, the trade associations supported the individual, lost as he was in the vast desert of the empire, some little society and enjoyment in life, and the certainty of funeral rites and a permanent memorial after death.\n\nAssociations formed for the maintenance of religious cults were usually called \"sodalitates,\" though the word \"collegium\" was also used for them, as in the case of the college of the Arval Brothers. Of the ancient \"Sodales Titii\" nothing is known until they were revived by Augustus; it may have been that when a \"gens\" or family charged with the maintenance of a particular cult had died out, its place was supplied by a \"sodalitas\".\n\nThe introduction of new cults also led to the institution of new associations. In 495 BC when the worship of Minerva was introduced, a \"collegium mercatorum\" was founded to maintain it, which held its feast on the \"dies natalis\" (dedication day) of the temple. In 387 the \"ludi Capitolini\" were placed under the care of a similar association of dwellers on the Capitoline Hill. In 204 BC when the \"Magna Mater\" (Great Mother, or Cybele) was introduced from Pessinus, a \"sodalitas\" was instituted which, as Cicero notes, used to feast together during the \"ludi Megalenses.\"\n\nAll such associations were duly licensed by the state, which at all times was vigilant in forbidding the maintenance of any which it deemed dangerous for religious or political reasons. In 186 BC the senate, by a decree of which part is preserved., made all combination for promoting the Bacchic religious rites strictly illegal. Legal \"sodalitates\" are frequent later; the temple of Venus Genetrix, begun by Julius Caesar and finished by Augustus, had its \"collegium\". \"Sodalilates\" were instituted for the cult of the deified emperors such as Augustus (see Augustales) and Claudius.\n\nSecuring a proper burial was one motive for a working class person to belong to a trade guild. In the year 133 under Hadrian, the formation of \"collegia\" specifically for this purpose was recognized by law, preserved at the head of the regulations of a \"collegium\" instituted for the worship of Diana and Antinous at Lanuvium. According to the \"Digest\" (47. 22), this was a general law allowing the founding of funerary associations, as long as the law against illicit \"collegia\" was complied with. The inscription of Lanuvium, together with many others, indicates that heir members were as a rule of the humblest classes of society, and often included slaves. Each member paid an entrance fee and a monthly subscription, and a funeral grant was made to his heir upon death in order to bury him in the burying-place of the college, or if they were too poor to construct one of their own, to secure burial in a public columbarium.\n\nThese colleges were organized along the same lines as the municipal towns of the empire. Their officers were elected, usually for a year, or in the case of honorary distinctions, for life. As in a municipal town, they held titles such as \"quinquennales, curatores,\" and \"praefecti.\" Quaestors superintended the finances of the association. Their place of meeting, if they were rich enough to have one, was called \"schola\" and was like a clubhouse. The site or the building was often given them by some rich patron, who was pleased to see his name engraved over its doorway.\n\nThe \"patroni\" increased in number, and more and more the colleges acquired the habit of depending on their benefactions. The inscriptions provide no evidence of whether the \"collegia\" also provided assistance to sick or infirm members. The only exceptions seem to be the military \"collegia\", which, though strictly forbidden as dangerous to discipline, continued to increase in number in spite of the law. Inscriptions from the great legionary camps of the Roman province of Africa show not only the existence of these clubs, but the way in which their funds were spent. It appears that they were applied to useful purposes in the life of a member as well as for his burial, e.g. to traveling expenses, or to his support after his discharge.\n\nAs the Roman Empire became gradually impoverished and depopulated, and as the difficulty of defending its frontiers increased, these associations must have been slowly extinguished. The sudden invasion of Dacia by barbarians in AD 166 was followed by the extinction of one \"collegium\" which has left a record of the fact, and probably by many others. The master of the college of Jupiter Cernenius, with the two quaestors and seven witnesses, attest the fact that the college has ceased to exist: \"The accounts have been wound up, and no balance is left in the chest. For a long time no member has attended on the days fixed for meetings, and no subscriptions have been paid.\n\nIn addition to the works cited below, see Mommsen, \"De Collegiis et Sodaliciis\" (1843), which laid the foundation for all subsequent study of the subject; Marquardt, \"Staatsverwaltung,\" iii. 134 foIl.; de Marchi, \"Il culto privato di Roma antica,\" ii. 75 foll.; Kornemann, s. v. \"Collegium\" in Pauly-Wissowa, \"Realencyclopädie.\"\n\n"}

It grows in and near swamps and other wet areas in tropical South America. It has been reported from Trinidad, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia.\n\n\"Mauritia flexuosa\", a tree, can reach up to in height. The large leaves form a rounded crown. The flowers are yellowish and appear from December to April. The fruit, which grows from December to June, is a chestnut color and is covered with shiny scales. The yellow flesh covers a hard, oval nut. The seeds float, and this is the means by which the palm tree propagates. In natural populations, the tree reaches very high densities.\n\nMoriche palm fruit (\"morete\" in the Oriente of Ecuador) is edible and used to make juice, jam, ice cream, a fermented \"wine\", desserts and snacks, requiring harvesting of more than 50 tonnes per day in Peru.\n\nThe inflorescence buds are eaten as a vegetable and the sap can be drunk fresh or fermented (see palm wine). Threads and cords are locally produced from the tree's fibers.\n\nHumans consume palm weevils which burrow in the tree trunk.\n\nBuriti oil is an orange-reddish oil extracted from the fruit of the moriche palm. The oil contains high concentrations of oleic acid, tocopherols, and carotenoids, especially beta-carotene. The oil has a reddish color used as ink on hides and skins.\n\nThis tree is important to many animal species; several bird species, such as the red-bellied macaw, sulphury flycatcher, and moriche oriole, use it for nesting and food. Tapirs, peccaries, fish and monkeys depend on the fruit.\n\nAlexander von Humboldt documented the tree and the ecosystem it supports in 1800 when traveling through the Llanos region of Venezuela. He \"observed with astonishment how many things are connected with the existence of a single plant.\" He called it the \"tree of life\" and essentially described it as a keystone species although the concept would not be explicitly defined until 1969 by Robert T. Paine.\n\nThe government of the Federal District - the Brazilian state where the country's capital, Brasília, is located - is called \"Palácio do Buriti\" (\"Buriti Palace\"). Across the street from the building is a square with fountains and a single moriche palm tree, which was taken from the outskirts of the city and replanted there. The species is a common feature of the cerrado vegetation that predominates in central Brazil.\n"}

The neighborhood of Roseville in Point Loma is named for him, as are Rose Creek and Rose Canyon.\n\nRose was a German Jewish immigrant and San Diego's first identifiable Jewish resident. He came to San Diego in 1850, via New Orleans, Louisiana and Texas. He traveled to California with Judge James W. Robinson's wagon train party. Arriving just as California became a state in 1850, he was a member of the first grand jury and first County Board of Supervisors. He was President of the Board of Trustees for San Diego during 1853–1855, and served on the San Diego School Board. Rose was a volunteer in the Garra Indian uprising.\n\nRose was central in the establishment and development of San Diego's Jewish community. High Holy Day services were held in his house. The Hebrew Benevolent Society was formed at his house. He donated the land for the first Jewish cemetery. Though a layman, he officiated for the community at a Jewish wedding. Rose was a founding member of Congregation Beth Israel (San Diego). Congregation Beth Israel became Temple Beth Israel, San Diego's largest synagogue.\n\nRose married twice. His first marriage was to Carolyn Marx in New Orleans. The marriage ended in divorce. Later in his life, in San Diego, Rose was introduced to and married a local Jewish widow, Matilda Newman. They had two children. One child died in infancy. Their second child, Henrietta Rose became a school teacher in San Diego. She never married. She was buried in an unmarked grave until the Louis Rose Society for the Preservation of Jewish History purchased a headstone, which was dedicated in partnership with the school district, the teachers union, and the Eastern Star Masonic Organization of which she was president of a lodge.\n\nLouis Rose was buried in the Jewish cemetery that he helped found. As San Diego developed, the old Jewish cemetery was sold and the bodies buried there were moved to a newer Jewish cemetery, the Home of Peace. In the process, Rose's original headstone was lost; later one was put in by people who knew him only by historical reputation and wished to honor his memory. The exact location of his interment is uncertain.\n\nRose realized that transportation would be important to San Diego. With his associate James W. Robinson, Rose founded the San Diego and Gila Railroad in 1855 and served as its treasurer. The railroad was never built.\n\nIn 1866 Rose bought land and laid out a town he called \"Roseville\" adjacent to San Diego Bay on the Point Loma peninsula. He laid out streets and built a wharf. He thought it would be a future city, and for a time it was a separate city competing with San Diego's New Town (now Downtown San Diego) across the bay. He hoped to link Roseville to a railroad. Many were skeptical about the prospects for Roseville or San Diego, but he would always say \"Just wait a while and you will see.\" Roseville eventually became part of the city of San Diego. A plaque at the corner of Rosecrans Street and Avenida de Portugal (which was the intersection of First and Main streets when Roseville was an independent city) recognizes the establishment of Roseville in 1869.\n\nRose was postmaster at Old Town, San Diego during 1873–1883. This was an honor considering that he was appointed by Republican presidents even though Rose himself was a lifelong Democrat.\n\nRose Creek and Rose Canyon in San Diego are named for him. He bought 650 acres in the canyon in 1853 and had a ranch there, with a tannery. He also prospected for gold and copper without too much success. The tannery provided capital to build a wharf and to lay out Roseville.\n\nRose died in 1888. He had one daughter, Henrietta, a school teacher who never married. He is buried in Home of Peace Cemetery on Imperial Avenue.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1957601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957601", "title": "Red Forman", "text": "Red Forman\n\nReginald Albert \"Red\" Forman is a fictional character on the Fox sitcom \"That '70s Show\", portrayed by Kurtwood Smith. The father of main character Eric Forman and husband of Kitty Forman, Red is a retired factory worker and war veteran living in Point Place, Wisconsin.\n\nRed is the perpetually disgruntled, ill-tempered father of Eric and Laurie Forman and Kitty Forman's husband as well as the foster father to Steven Hyde. He is seemingly insensitive to other people, but admits frequently in the series that this is to maintain his self-identity of being a \"man\". In some episodes, his tough exterior crumbles when he encounters other people's needs and he eventually makes decisions that show ethical regard for doing what is right.\n\nHis relationship with his children is complex. Although he dotes on his lying, manipulative, promiscuous daughter, Laurie (with whom, tellingly, Kitty has a strained and contentious relationship) until season 2 when he finds out she's living with a man in Chicago, he points out Eric's perceived flaws and faults mercilessly, often calling him “dumbass”. The two clash in most episodes with Eric teasing his father, or \"poking the bear\". Red frequently threatens to \"put my foot up your ass\" to Eric but is never seen physically disciplining his son (In the series finale, he admits that the only he time he ever literally did it was during his service in Iwo Jima), usually punishing him with chores, fines, and, once, by imposing a strict curfew, which leads to windows being nailed shut, bed checks, etc. until Kitty calls an end to it. Eric usually views these paternal idiosyncracies in a humorous light, even lampooning them, but sometimes seems to be holding in his own anger and doing a slow burn.\n\nOn other occasions, father and son unite to collude in a scheme or plot, share a joke, or even face the displeasure of Kitty together. Many episodes show the respect between the two characters, with Red even admitting on one occasion that his love for Eric does not need to be articulated, it is \"just a given\". Despite Red's firm stance with his son, he protects Eric when the situation calls for it; for example, in one episode when Bob accuses Eric of being a poor influence on his daughter, Red gives him a cold send-off.\n\nRed finds his neighbors, Bob and Midge Pinciotti, perplexing and vexatious. Bob is genial but insensitive, and Midge is rather dim-witted. Their daughter, Donna, is Eric's girlfriend. Red dislikes spending time in their company, although is frequently compelled to do so by his wife, Kitty. In particular, his views of Bob range from annoyance to contempt. Despite this antagonistic attitude, several episodes portray Red as a good neighbor who will come to the assistance of Bob when absolutely needed.\n\nRed shows very strict discipline to those with lesser authority than himself (especially the teenagers), from which he seems to take joy. He can also be curt with those in authority, though this trait in him is rare. On one occasion, when Red and Kitty are making out in their car, a policeman knocks on the window, not realizing it is a married couple inside. Red sharply dispatches him and Kitty says, \"How sweet, you let him off with a warning\".\n\nIn his youth, Red served in the U.S. Navy (in the season 3 episode, \"Jackie Bags Hyde\", he is shown wearing the dress-blue uniform of a Chief Petty Officer for Veterans Day) and often brings up memories of his service in Korea. Red was a Boatswain Mate in the Navy during World War II and Korea. He served on a destroyer but also saw land combat in Guadalcanal (August 1942 – February 1943) and Korea (1950 – 1953). As evidenced in Season 8, Episode 6 \"Long Away,\" Red is wearing Submarine Warfare (Dolphins) on his garrison cap during the Veterans reunion.\n\nIn one episode, he and Eric have both completely forgotten about Kitty's birthday, which deeply upsets her. After purchasing her some very low quality \"gifts\" from the only open nearby establishment, a garage, items Kitty immediately recognizes as junk, Red cheers her up by taking her square-dancing, an activity she enjoys.\n\nRed loves to drink beer and consume food which is bad for his health, having suffered from a heart attack on one occasion. Red is also shown as a die-hard fan of the Green Bay Packers, even, in one episode, threatening to kick out visiting new neighbors, Josh and Jeff who are a gay male couple, solely because they were Minnesota Vikings fans. He is also a fan of the Milwaukee Bucks and the Milwaukee Brewers. An exception appears to lie for his rooting interests in college football, however, where he appears to favor the Notre Dame Fighting Irish over the Wisconsin Badgers.\n\nRed's health has been the subject of humor on occasion. In the third and sixth seasons, he is briefly put on a diet that requires him to cut out red meat among other foods that he generally likes and, in stereotypical sitcom fashion, he is forced to eat \"healthy\" food that is good for him but that he finds unappealing. On both occasions, he defies the diet by eating \"real food\" behind Kitty's back. When faced with mush, he comments \"This isn't food, this is what food eats!\" When faced with his diet in the sixth season, after his heart attack upon learning Laurie has married Fez (he has a problem with foreigners), he throws the list of what he cannot have away, explaining to Kitty that if he had known what he would be asked to give up, \"I would have walked straight into that bright light and never looked back!\"\n\nAt one point, shortly after finding out that Eric and Donna were moving to Madison, Red went fishing to calm down, and comes back with the surprising news that he is proud of Eric for his initiative in moving away and becoming engaged, and even more so for his standing up to Red by insisting on marrying Donna despite Red's disapproval. An angry Kitty and an overjoyed Eric listen while Red agrees to pay for both the wedding and Eric's college fund. He also shakes Eric's hand, proudly telling his son that he is now a man and he has his blessing. Eric caused Red to have a heart attack just before he was to leave for Madison. After his heart attack, which prompts Eric to stay home, Red's attitude towards Eric does a complete reversal, and Red goes back to calling his son \"dumbass\", presumably due to his disappointment in Eric's failure to live up to his expectations yet again, although he told Eric that he was proud of him for deciding to stay and help the family instead of leaving for college. This reversal could be due to Eric leaving Donna at the altar and subsequently spending a year doing nothing, or the producers' use of a \"Reset Button\" to get the status quo back.\n\nFor the first few seasons of the series' run, Red is established as a blue collar conservative. He made a joke at Nixon's expense in the first season after Eric streaked through the crowd while wearing a Nixon mask and, in a pivotal moment, expressed disdain for Gerald Ford (when allowed to ask President Ford a question he said \"Hey 'Gerry', here's my question: 'How the hell could you pardon Nixon?'\") in front of the entire town. However, without precedent, later seasons portrayed him to be a staunch Republican, who became angry when Eric made an anti-Nixon joke in the fifth season, which Eric tries to cover by replying, \"Nixon was framed and Kennedy was a commie.\" It is likely that, like many Republican voters in the 1970s, Red is disappointed in Nixon and Ford, but afterward leans back to supporting the Republican Party. In addition, many Nixon supporters felt that pardoning Nixon was akin to admitting he was guilty (as accepting a pardon requires an admission of guilt).\n\nRed feels strongly about the founding principles of the American government, owing to his service in the Navy as a Boatswain's Mate. He also tries to live up to what are generally considered American \"family values\": hard work, devotion to his family and being faithful to his wife. He is disgusted by swinger sex clubs (which he considers immoral) and political corruption (on hearing that Jackie's wealthy father may be able to bribe his way out of jail, an appalled Red mutters, \"I'm so glad I took a piece of shrapnel to make that possible\").\n\nRed also dislikes foreigners, which is the main reason he doesn't see eye-to-eye with Fez. One episode, \"Hunting\" saw him taking offense at Fez's remark of, \"Not everything in the Constitution makes sense.\" He dislikes anyone and anything not from America – despite driving a Toyota. In fact, out of everyone in his family, he was the most comfortable and casual when Hyde's biological father William Barnett (an African-American) came to his house. He once described Canada and France as \"lesser countries\", and was upset to find that his daughter Laurie's room had posters of foreign cars on her bedroom walls after Hyde moved into it, and generally refers to the rest of the world as \"not America\". Along with Canada and France, Red also dislikes Germany, Japan and Great Britain, though not explicitly stated, Italy (for their role in World War II) and, especially, North Korea as he fought there. He also seems bitter about America not winning the Vietnam War, claiming, \"We didn't lose the war, it was a tie\". In one episode, while Hyde was stating a conspiracy theory about the government putting tracking devices in their brains, Red patriotically replied, \"Without our government, you'd be stuck in Siberia now, sucking the juice from a rotten commie potato. Let me tell you something. If the U.S. government decides to stick a tracking device up your ass, you say, 'Thank You! and God Bless America! '\" Insulting communism is a favorite pastime with Red such as when he calls Eric \"the laziest non-communist I ever met\". However, when he sells his muffler shop so he can retire he says he does not care if the store is converted to a \"communist recreation center\".\n\nAlthough deep down Red does genuinely care about Eric's friends, he doesn't like them frequently hanging out in his home. One of his favorite phrases to describe Eric and his friends is \"dumbass\". He also threatens the teens that he will put his \"foot in your ass\". In the finale, he claims that the only time he ever put his foot in someone's ass was in Iwo Jima, something that he declines to go into detail about. His antagonism towards the teenagers is mainly because Red prefers peace and quiet, believing that since he has worked hard and raised his children, he deserves time to himself and with Kitty. With regards to his neighbors Bob and Midge Pinciotti, it is indicated that Red used to enjoy their friendship before they started to get \"into every fad there is\". Even though he feels that Bob is a \"good neighbor and a good friend\", he gets easily annoyed in Bob's presence.\n\nHe is a tough, no-nonsense father and tends to favor his daughter Laurie (Lisa Robin Kelly & Christina Moore) and foster son Hyde (Danny Masterson) over his son Eric (Topher Grace), whom he considers soft, skinny, twitchy and wimpy. He always sees Laurie as \"a giant apple\" instead of the mean-spirited, promiscuous person she truly is but becomes wiser to her in the second season after finding out she lied to him about moving in with a friend when she was really living with a young man. In one episode, Kitty asks Red why he is so tough on Eric, only to have Red respond, \"The same reason my old man was so tough on me\", indicating that he went through a similar childhood to Eric's. Though Red often puts his own son down because he wants him to \"be a man like himself\", it cannot be denied that Eric is merely a younger version of his father in the sense that both have a very dry sense of humor and tend to be the sanest persons in their respective circles of friends. On a few occasions in season one, Red shows Eric affection. When the two return from a wrestling match, they wrestle for a bit before Red gave Eric a hug. Later on, when Red's mother dies, Red calls Eric over for a hug with him and Kitty in a family moment. In the final episode of season seven, as Eric is leaving for Africa, Red has a real heart-to-heart talk with Eric, in which he admitted he loved him and that he would miss him, culminating in a hug between father and son. In the season 8 premiere, Kitty tries to get Red to say something nice for Eric on the tape recorder. Red consistently refuses and appears to revel in Eric being gone. However, when Kitty questions his feelings on the matter, Red admitted that he honestly missed Eric. (Unbeknownst to Red, though, Kitty secretly recorded him saying this). Red also seems to respect his son's resistance as shown when he told Eric he respected him for staying with Donna despite Red's efforts.\n\nMost of the time, Red treats Eric's friend Hyde (Danny Masterson), who moved in with the Formans' at the end of the first season, better than he treats his own son; perhaps this is because Red thinks Hyde needs a father figure as his own left him. Red also shows appreciation to Hyde for his mechanical skills, evident from when he opened his own muffler store. Hyde quickly assembles muffler displays, while Eric is putting up decorations. Also, Red often more readily has heart-to-hearts with Hyde than with Eric. When Hyde is arrested for possession of marijuana (which had actually belonged to Jackie), he wanted to throw Hyde out, but soon had a change of heart and let him stay after learning the truth. However, this doesn't stop Red from giving Hyde an extremely long telling off. Hyde assumed the Formans would want him to move out on his eighteenth birthday because all of Hyde's relatives had to move out of their places when they were eighteen. Red told Hyde that he needed to stay at the Formans' house so he would not end up like his relatives (who were either dead, in jail, or \"pumping gas\"). Much of this comes from Hyde's troubled background and Red's view that Hyde just needs some direction in life.\n\nOn the other hand, a few instances have shown that Red still cares about Eric, and it is clear that Red's being hard on him is Red's way of trying to toughen Eric up to prepare him for the real world (he once stated that, as Eric's father, it was his job to make Eric a man, \"which he's not\"). Red once told Eric, \"I love you\", but he was drugged after a visit to the dentist. After Eric later said it back and some awkwardness ensued, Red said that you should only say that when you're drunk, dying or in trouble—\"Otherwise, it's just a given\".\n\nLike Kitty, Red is often forced to act as a parental figure for Eric's friends Kelso (Ashton Kutcher), Fez (Wilmer Valderrama), Jackie (Mila Kunis), Hyde (Danny Masterson) and Donna (Laura Prepon)—albeit reluctantly. He usually only helps out at Kitty's insistence or simply to get the teens out of his house. Red actually likes Donna, mostly because he thinks that if Eric has a son with her he will be good at sports and both freely and cheerily admits she is too good for his own son, and also that if Eric and Donna get married Eric will leave the house. Red has a low opinion of Kelso and Fez, calling Kelso a \"Kettlehead\" and referring to Fez as the \"foreign kid\", and sometimes by the generic names of \"Haji\", \"Sabu\", \"Ali Baba\", \"Tutankhamun\" or \"Anwar\". However, he has bonded with them both a few times throughout the series, such as when he cooperated with Kelso to change the Pong electronic game so they can make the paddles smaller, thus making the game more challenging. Red also bonded with Fez when he gave Fez advice that it is not a good idea to mix women and alcohol together. Early on, Red stated that Jackie is his favorite out of all of Eric's friends. He says unlike the others, she is \"not useless\" because she perfectly held a flashlight for him while he worked on his car, while Eric was incapable of this simple task. Jackie has hugged Red on a few occasions, at least half of which he returned.\n\nIn the final season, Red takes a liking to Hyde's new friend and co-worker, Randy Pearson (Josh Meyers). Red respects Randy simply because he's the polar opposite of Eric: masculine, crafty and not at all obsessed with \"Star Wars\" (though in one episode, it is shown that Randy is indeed a fan). Unlike Kitty, Red had no problem with him starting a relationship with Donna.\n"}

Doggy Style Allstars Vol. 1\n\nSnoop Dogg Presents... Doggy Style Allstars, Welcome To Tha House Vol. 1 is a compilation presented by American rapper Snoop Dogg. It was released August 13, 2002 on Snoop Dogg's own label, Doggystyle Records. The album features production by DJ Premier, Quazedelic, Fredwreck, Meech Wells, The Alchemist, Hi-Tek DJ Slip and regionally promoted by Radio Bums. It peaked at number 8 on the \"Billboard\" Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and at number 19 on the \"Billboard\" 200. The album features performances by Snoop Dogg, Kokane, RBX, Daz Dillinger, Soopafly, Nate Dogg and The Lady of Rage, Latoiya Williams..\n\n\"Chart\" - \"Leave it to Snoop to deliver a bumpin' P-Funk beat. In Tha House Vol. 1 is the audio equivalent of his Doggy Style porn series and Hollywood comedies — no convoluted themes, just the down-ass dirty shit that keeps people coming back for more. He's got his crew — Mr. Kane, Soopafly, LaToiya Williams and E-White — out in full force. All have the lyrical skills to pay the bills, but it's those bass-heavy beats that'll blow your sub and your mind. There are no clear highlights, just a steady, slow-burning dose of funky cheeba. This is the best thing Snoop has done outside of his work with Dr. Dre, thanks in large part to the involvement of producers like Hi-Tek, DJ Premier and the Alchemist, the Album sold in the first week 63,000 copies and reached in 2012 1,320,000 Copies .\"\n\nThere was a DVD released at the same time called Snoop Dogg - Welcome to the House - The Doggumentary. Two videos were shot to promote the album, first one for \"Fallen star\" sung by Latoiya Williams filmed in August 2002 and directed by Diane Martel and Snoop who renamed himself Snoop Scorsese for that one-time occasion. It also finished at the 85th in BET's Top Music Videos of 2002. Another video is for track #3 \"Not like it was\" a Jessy Terrero (Right Thurr, Outta Control) piece, which was first aired in November 2002.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1957612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957612", "title": "No Limit Top Dogg", "text": "No Limit Top Dogg\n\nNo Limit Top Dogg is the fourth studio album and second on No Limit Records by American rapper Snoop Dogg. It was released May 11, 1999, by No Limit Records and Priority Records. Following the mixed reception of his previous two albums, Snoop began to work again with Dr. Dre and returned to the west coast sound of his earlier career while on Death Row Records. The album was generally met with positive reception with many critics citing it as a return to form and his best album since \"Doggystyle\" (1993). Many praised the production work for the album with the tracks made by Dr. Dre being highlighted as well as Snoop's delivery while criticism was mainly aimed at the length of the album, the No Limit features, and the lack of new lyrical content. The Source would later put the album on their list of the Top 10 Best Albums of the Year for 1999.\n\n\"No Limit Top Dogg\" debuted at #2 on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling 187,000 copies in its first week alone in the United States, second only to Ricky Martin's self-titled album. This would be Snoop Dogg's first album to not debut at number-one and would ultimately end up being his lowest selling album of the 1990s. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). As of March 2008, the album has sold 1,518,000 copies in the United States and 2 million worldwide as of 2016.\n\nFollowing the release of his previous album on No Limit, Snoop was granted more creative freedom by Master P which resulted in an album that returned to the sound of his early days on Death Row. Snoop Dogg explained \"Master P signed me, so he had the right to dictate and direct me on the first album, because he was bringing me out as a No Limit soldier. To let me have creative control from the beginning wouldn't have been the smartest thing to do.\" \n\nWith this new found freedom, Snoop sought out the help of former mentor and producer Dr. Dre. The album marks the first time they work together on record since Dre left Death Row. Regarding their relationship over the years, Snoop said \"Behind the scenes, we've been basically helping each other out and critiquing each other's projects,\" He then added \"We just went back to working with each other publicly ... the public wanted it, and we wanted it, and we're pushing for it and we're doing it.\" Attempts at reuniting date back to early 1998 when both collaborated on the song Zoom. However, contract problems emerged that prevented the release of said version (Snoop's verses were eventually replaced by east coast rapper LL Cool J and included in the soundtrack to the film Bulworth). Along with a slew of other former label mates and collaborators like Warren G, Nate Dogg, Jewell, DJ Quik, and Raphael Saadiq, Snoop himself viewed the album to be a companion piece to his debut album \"Doggystyle\".\n\nThe album cover also marks a significant departure from the usual design style of all No Limit releases. In regards to this decision, Master P stated \"When you look at that Snoop record, you know, you let Snoop be himself.\" He further stated \"You look at his cover and it's got none of the bling and stuff that we always had, it's more about the dogs and what his image is about.\"\n\nIn comparison to his previous release \"Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told\" which according to Snoop only took three weeks to make, work on this album spanned over many months beginning in 1998. The album also marks a departure from the southern sound of previous No Limit releases with only a few tracks featuring production and vocals from other No Limit artists and producers. Instead opting to work with more fellow west coast artists and producers in a \"conscious effort\" to return his brand of music that was present earlier in his career. Of the 19 songs on the album, three were produced by Dr. Dre. \"It was matter of getting some shit from Dre that I didn't have, that would best represent him and would best represent me over his music,\" Snoop Dogg said. \"He [directed] me on what to say and how to say it. I just chose the type of beats I wanted and the type of topics I wanted to rap about.\" In response to working again with Snoop and how times have changed since last working together, Dre stated the following:\n\nSnoop also continues a previous tradition on his albums to include a cover of an older Hip-Hop song with the song \"Snoopafella\" (a remake of the song \"Cinderfella Dana Dane\" by New York rapper Dana Dane). Despite limited involvement on a musical level from No Limit, Snoop has stated that Master P has influenced the album in other ways with the track \"I Love My Momma\". Snoop mentions \"If I wouldn't be on No Limit, I wouldn't even did a song like that, but since Master P, every album he do, he got a song about his momma. He got a song about his dead brother.\" Snoop also took influence again in his vocal performance from Dr. Dre himself during the process of making and recording songs. He further commented on the chemistry they both still had despite being separate for a while as well as how Dre once again took on a mentor role with him.\n\nThe overall production of the album has been noted to be heavily rooted in early '80s funk with a mixture of both West Coast and southern influences coming from his label at No Limit and his associates from his tenure at Death Row. In comparison to \"Da Game\", only two tracks on the whole album are produced by No Limit's in-house production team Beats by the Pound. Dr. Dre's involvement was a major point of interest of the album for both fans and critics at the time of release with his influence being prevalent throughout. Despite his involvement, the album also branches out to newer styles of music that differs from ones found on \"The Chronic\" and \"Doggystyle\". On tracks like \"Buck 'Em\", guitar elements were used that became present on other Dre productions of the time (like Eminem's \"Role Model\" from The Slim Shady LP) which hinted at what was to be featured on Dre's own 2001 album later that year. Other producers also make new contributions like the use of violins on the song \"Trust Me\", a rap ballad commenting about relationships. The album also ventures further into soul than previous releases with tracks like \"Somethin' Bout Yo Bidness\" and \"I Love My Momma\". Less apparent in the album's production is also the chiming keyboard loops found in Dre's earlier work that was highly popular at the time. The album is also a precursor to the West Coast Hip-Hop resurgence in popularity during that year.\n\n\"Top Dogg\" generally gained positive reviews with many critics citing it as a return to form after the mixed reception and different direction of the previous two albums released. Nathan Rabin of \"The A.V. Club\" noted \"... Dogg sounds happier, looser, and more confident on \"Top Dogg\" than he has on any album since his \"Chronic\"/\"Doggystyle\" glory days.\" Later in the review he called it \"... a vital album, and easily Snoop Dogg's best album since Doggystyle.\" \"The Washington Post\" highlighted the Dre-produced tracks \"Just Dippin'\" and \"Buck 'Em\" as one of the best Snoop-Dre collaborations. \"Source\" writer Frank Williams called it nearly flawless and said \"By returning to his original 1993 flyness, Snoop meshes all his influences to create an album that will ride for a long time.\" The magazine later included the album on its \"Top 10 Albums of the Year [1999]\" list. Kevin Powell of \"Rolling Stone\" called the album \"Snoop's finest work since his debut album...full of seductive party jams that will keep heads bobbing through the summer. Snoop has returned to West Coast G-funk with the help of some old friends...like Dr. Dre and DJ Quik.\" Neil Strauss of \"The New York Times\" positively compared the album to Snoop Dogg's previous release calling it a major musical improvement. \"NME\" mentioned \"...the silken, sumptuous flow of yore is back, threading deluxe soul and full-bodied grooves...the cool drawl of Snoop...captivates, unveiling tales of love, thuggery, surviving and succeeding in the wild west...a certifiable return to form.\"\n\nDespite the overall positive reception to the album it did receive some criticism from critics. The majority of it being aimed at the length of the whole project as well as the obligatory No Limit tracks. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of \"Allmusic\" said \"...it runs way too long and is filled with superfluous, even irritating cameos, and also that Snoop is content to haul out low-rent gangsta clichés.\" He further comments on the lack of interesting and clever lyrics in comparison to his older material years ago. The A.V. Club also addresses the length being a problem with it being a few tracks too long. Criticism is also drawn to the tracks with features from other No Limit artists which writer Nathan Rabin considers to be the lowest points of the whole album. The Source's only criticism of the album is also aimed at the two No Limit tracks \"Down 4 My Niggaz\" and \"Ghetto Symphony\" calling them \"overly-simplistic\". Rolling Stone in particular criticized Snoop's lack of growth as a lyricist while declaring the whole album as not worthy of being compared to his debut.\n\nIn a retrospective list by \"Complex\", the magazine placed \"No Limit Top Dogg\" at Number 17 on their list of \"The Top 25 Best No Limit Albums\" on April 5, 2013. This is the only album by Snoop Dogg on the label to be included on the list. \"Entertainment Weekly\" in 2015 ranked the album third overall as Snoop Dogg's best album only behind 2002's \"Paid Tha Cost To Be Da Bo$$\" and 1993's \"Doggystyle\" respectively.\n\n\"No Limit Top Dogg\" debuted at number-two and one on the US \"Billboard\" 200 and Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums respectively, selling 187,400 copies in its first week. which was second only to Ricky Martin's 1999 self-titled album with huge first week sales of 661,000 copies. The following week the album sold an additional 108,000 copies dropping to number-seven until eventually bowing out of the top ten the following week. Although the release of the single 'Bitch Please' which gained popularity on both the radio and television helped album sales with a 16% rise on the \"Billboard\" 200 after months of declining on the charts. Despite not being as commercially successful as Still a G Thang from his previous album as it failed to chart within the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 (peaking at 77), it still managed to peak at number-eight on the \"Billboard Hot Rap Singles\" on August 28 making it one of his highest ranking songs on that chart at the time. The music video also peaked at number-three on BET and charted within the top 20 most played videos on MTV. The video was directed by Dr. Dre.\n\n\"Top Dogg\" eventually spent 40 weeks on the \"Billboard\" 200 which is second only to \"Doggystyle\" on weeks spent on the charts for a Snoop Dogg album. Despite being Snoop Dogg's first album to not debut at number-one and have strong first-week album sales, it was certified platinum on October 13, 1999 and sold 1,100,000 copies by the end of 1999 making it the 73rd best selling album of the year. Some speculated the reason for the relatively low turn out for the first week sales of the album is a result of the anticipation for Ricky Martin's album released the same week. The low awareness for the album was also thought to be due to a lack of a video or hit single prior to the release. As of March 2008, the album has sold 1,518,000 copies in the United States and 2 million worldwide as of 2016.\n\nBuss'n Rocks\n20 Minutes\nBetta Days\nBitch Please\nSnoopafella\nDon't Tell\nDown 4 My N's\nGhetto Symphony\nIn Love With a Thug\nMy Heat Goes Boom\nParty With a D.P.G.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1957613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957613", "title": "Fortunately, Unfortunately", "text": "Fortunately, Unfortunately\n\nFortunately, Unfortunately is a word game first played at conventions of the National Puzzlers' League in the late 1980s. It was invented and introduced by one-time NPL president David Scott Marley. A version of the game, called \"Good News, Bad News\" was popularized by the BBC radio show I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue. The game is best played in groups with an odd number of people. It is often played on Internet forums.\n\nThe Fortunately, Unfortunately word game follows a standard format:\n\n\nThe game does not have any specified ending point.\n\nThere is a children's book named \"Fortunately\" by Remy Charlip that follows this same pattern, first published in 1964.\n\nRather than making a single \"Fortunately...\" (or \"Unfortunately...\") statement, each person in the group can provide a long alternating list of sentences/statements. The psychological and comic effect of this form of the game is somewhat different because the same person is forced to flip rapidly between a positive and negative outlook. Players take turns in an intuitive way, like performers handing the \"solo\" off to another member of the group. Because of the more continuous thread of consciousness underlying the series of \"Fortunately/Unfortunately\" statements, this variation can also be used as a form of meditation or humor-assisted therapy.\n\nPerformers at the Studio for Interrelated Media (SIM) experimented with this game in the early 1990s. Now it is commonly played within MENSA groups and with members of MENSA.\n\n"}
{"id": "1957627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957627", "title": "The Mega Powers", "text": "The Mega Powers\n\nThe Mega Powers was a tag team in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from 1987 to 1989, consisting of Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage, and managed by Savage's wife, Miss Elizabeth. Lust and jealousy surrounding her led to the team's demise and subsequent feud. They briefly reformed in World Championship Wrestling in 1994 as The Monster Maniacs, and interacted sporadically thereafter.\n\nPrior to the fall of 1987, Hogan and Savage were bitter enemies. In fact, from late 1985 through mid-summer 1987, the two often wrestled for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Hogan was able to defeat Savage on many of these occasions, although Savage gained some important countout and disqualification victories over Hogan as well. While Hogan was the most popular star in the WWF during most of this time, Savage—who was the WWF Intercontinental Champion for many of their matches in 1986 and early 1987—had gained a strong following even during his heel days, and by July 1987, was starting to get more cheers than boos. A slow face turn for Savage was beginning, and gained credibility when an angle was started involving The Honky Tonk Man (a heel who had since won the Intercontinental Championship) began making disparaging comments about Savage. (To also aid in Savage's face turn, the WWF began booking him against various heels, including King Kong Bundy and Killer Khan, with those matches taking place prior to his first match against Honky).\n\nThe Mega Powers officially formed their alliance, then, on the October 3, 1987 \"Saturday Night's Main Event XII\" (taped September 23, 1987), when Savage sought to win the Intercontinental Championship from Honky Tonk Man. When Savage hit his diving elbow drop finisher on Honky for the pin, The Hart Foundation came in and attacked Savage, getting Honky disqualified.\n\nWhen Honky shoved Miss Elizabeth to the mat, who was trying to stop them, she ran away to the backstage area; meanwhile, Honky completed his attempt to break his guitar over Savage's head. Shortly afterward, Miss Elizabeth returned with Savage's former rival Hulk Hogan, who came and saved Savage from the assault. Afterwards, Savage extended his hand in friendship to Hogan, who accepted and the three paraded around the ring with their hands adjoined. Their alliance solidified Savage's change into a fan favorite, which had been brewing for weeks as fan support grew for him. Later that night, during a backstage interview with Gene Okerlund, Savage and Hogan shook hands again and Savage referred to themselves for the first time as the Mega Powers. Hogan stated that \"the combination of 'Hulkamania' and 'Macho Madness' may become the most powerful force in WWF history\".\n\nOver the next four months, Hogan and Savage would team up several times. The first being at a house show in Vancouver, BC, on November 10, 1987. It was a six-man tag team match with Hogan and Savage teaming with Jim Duggan to defeat the team of King Kong Bundy, Rick Rude and Harley Race. Their second tag team match was held in Huntsville, Alabama on January 5, 1988. It was a dark match at a television taping where Hogan and Savage defeated the team of Honky Tonk Man and the Hart Foundation in a handicap match. Another six-man tag team match was held in Montreal on February 8, 1988 with Hogan and Savage teaming up with Ricky Steamboat to defeat the Honky Tonk Man and the Hart Foundation.\n\nOn the March 12, 1988 episode of \"Saturday Night's Main Event XV\", Savage wrestled Ted DiBiase in a singles match. DiBiase was accompanied by Virgil and André The Giant. Halfway through the match the referee ejected Virgil from ringside for outside interference. The match ended when Andre took advantage of the referee being incapacitated and rammed Savage into the ringpost. When the referee came to he counted Savage out of the ring. Following the match, Virgil returned to the ring and joined DiBiase and Andre in a 3-on-1 beating of Savage. Miss Elizabeth ran away from ringside and when she returned she was with Hulk Hogan, who ran into the ring carrying a steel chair. Hogan saved Savage from any further attacks by chasing the trio out of the ring. Afterwards, Hogan helped Savage back to his feet.\n\nA tournament was made to decide a new WWF World Heavyweight Champion after Hogan \"lost\" the title to André the Giant at \"The Main Event I\" on February 5, 1988. André immediately surrendered the belt to Ted DiBiase. It was revealed that DiBiase had hired referee Dave Hebner's twin brother, Earl, to pretend to be Dave and give Hogan a bogus three count when Hulk's shoulder was clearly off the mat before the count of three. Between the referee cheating Hogan, André forfeiting the title and DiBiase's illegal attempt to buy the title, this caused WWF President Jack Tunney to declare the championship vacant.\n\nHogan and André were both given byes in the first round of the tournament, but fought to a double-disqualification in the quarterfinals. This had the side effect of giving Ted DiBiase a bye in the semifinals. Ultimately, Savage and DiBiase met in the final match of the tournament. DiBiase did all that he could to take out Savage (including the constant interference of André, who was acting as DiBiase's second for this match), but he couldn't keep him down. Savage eventually went to Miss Elizabeth, whispering something to her. She ran backstage, as the fans were trying to figure out what was going on.\n\nA few minutes later, Miss Elizabeth re-emerged with Hogan. André and DiBiase seemed shocked by the turn of events. Hogan got revenge on DiBiase by hitting him in the back with a steel chair while André had distracted the referee by preventing Savage from getting to the ropes while locked in DiBiase's Million Dollar Dream. Savage was able to hit his diving elbow drop finisher and got the three count. After the match, they celebrated as a group.\n\nA few months later, with Hogan on leave of absence from the WWF and Savage feuding with DiBiase over the title, DiBiase and André attacked Savage during an interview segment prompting Savage to challenge the two to a tag team match against him and a partner of his choosing, which was accepted. Savage then revealed that his partner would be the returning Hogan and that they would meet André and DiBiase at SummerSlam.\n\nTheir official televised debut match as a tag team was at SummerSlam '88. They went against André the Giant and Ted DiBiase in a match billed as \"The Mega Powers versus the Mega Bucks\". Jesse Ventura, a longtime supporter of Savage's but a longtime adversary of Hogan's, served as referee for this match. The match didn't go as planned for the Mega Bucks. Miss Elizabeth exposed her assets in skimpy panties after stripping off her skirt to the heels, resulting in the Mega Powers coming back to win the match. Ventura counted but hesitated at two, so Savage forced the three-count.\n\nAt the 1988 Survivor Series, Hogan and Savage captained a team that faced a five-member squad headed by Big Boss Man and Akeem (who by now were being billed as The Twin Towers). Hogan and Savage eventually won the match (last eliminating King Haku, Big Boss Man and Akeem had been counted out and disqualified, respectively); during the post-match posing, Hogan again began acting friendly toward Miss Elizabeth, visibly annoying Savage. In a post-match interview, pro-heel commentator Jesse Ventura interviewed Savage, playing up Savage's growing anger regarding Hogan's behavior toward Miss Elizabeth. However, Miss Elizabeth was not the only reason Hogan and Savage had issues with each other during their stint as a team.\n\nThe two had an uneasy relationship, particularly when it became obvious Hogan would act friendly and/or protective toward Miss Elizabeth. On \"Saturday Night's Main Event XVII\" and \"XX\", Hogan was insistent on Miss Elizabeth appearing at ringside for his matches versus King Haku, Akeem, and Bad News Brown. In the latter instance, Miss Elizabeth's was endangered by Akeem and his allies, Slick and King Haku when Big Boss Man grabbed Miss Elizabeth and placed her in handcuffs; before Big Boss Man could use his nightstick to strike Miss Elizabeth, Savage ran out and made the save. While Savage showed concern for Miss Elizabeth, he disregarded Hogan, who was still reeling from being attacked by The Big Boss Man and Akeem.\n\nAt the 1989 Royal Rumble, Hogan accidentally eliminated Savage in the Royal Rumble match when he went to put out Bad News Brown (with whom Savage was having a concurrent feud). The two appeared to make amends at the behest of their manager, but Savage was clearly upset after the event (which was ultimately won by Big John Studd).\n\nThings came to a full boil on February 3, 1989 on NBC's prime-time special, \"The Main Event II\" when the two wrestled The Twin Towers. During the match, Akeem threw Savage out of the ring. Savage was thrown onto Miss Elizabeth, knocking her unconscious. Hogan saw what happened and carried Miss Elizabeth from the ring to the medical area. When Miss Elizabeth was revived, she implored a distraught Hogan to return to the ring to help Savage, who had been left to fight the two gargantuans on his own for several minutes. Hogan eventually called for the tag, but Savage, who was furious with being abandoned during the match, slapped Hogan in the face. After some choice words to a confused Hogan, he took his world championship belt, and stormed back to the locker room. Hogan defeated The Twin Towers by himself. After the match, Hogan went to check on Miss Elizabeth. Savage was back there too, who was caught in mid-tirade yelling to Miss Elizabeth that as world champion he was tired of taking a backseat to both Hogan and Miss Elizabeth in the Mega Powers pecking order. Upon Hogan's arrival, Savage turned his frustration to him, accused Hogan of trying to steal Miss Elizabeth from him, and manipulate the belt away from him. Hogan implored Miss Elizabeth to try and talk some sense into him before Savage attacked him by hitting him in the face with the title belt, sealing the end to their partnership and beginning their feud.\n\nHogan's first response to Savage's actions was to challenge him at WrestleMania for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, which Savage eventually accepted. Most of the leadup to the match involved two things: the first being Savage showing (heavily edited and out of context) footage to prove that Hogan \"lusted after\" Miss Elizabeth, after which Hogan would respond by showing the footage in its proper context and with explanation; and the question of whose corner would Miss Elizabeth be in. Miss Elizabeth ultimately announced she would be in a neutral corner.\n\nOn April 2, 1989, Hogan and Savage decided to settle the score at WrestleMania V for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Although Miss Elizabeth was stationed in her \"neutral corner\" for the match, she was eventually ejected from ringside after too many complications were caused by her attempting to assist both men at different points in the match. After an even match between both, Hogan eventually prevailed after kicking out of a Savage's diving elbow drop before \"hulking up\" and executing the leg drop to become WWF World Heavyweight Champion for the second time.\n\nThe two would continue their feud in the months following WrestleMania. Savage replaced Miss Elizabeth as his manager with Sensational Sherri after Wrestlemania V and aligned himself with Hogan's co-star from the movie \"No Holds Barred\", Tiny Lister (who appeared in character as Zeus, his role in the film). This extension of the angle would culminate at SummerSlam when Hogan and Brutus Beefcake (with a return appearance by Miss Elizabeth) would defeat Savage and Zeus in the main event, and a December 1989 cage match between the two teams during a pay-per-view event entitled \"No Holds Barred: The Match, The Movie\".\n\nSavage and Hogan would meet one last time for a WrestleMania V rematch on the February 23, 1990 edition \"The Main Event III\" with Heavyweight Boxing Champion James \"Buster\" Douglas as the guest referee. Hogan would come out victorious yet again with Savage knocked out by Douglas post-match.\n\nAfter his feud with Hogan came to a final conclusion, Savage began a rivalry with The Ultimate Warrior and cost him his WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Sgt. Slaughter at the Royal Rumble in January 1991. Savage and Warrior would face off in a retirement match at WrestleMania VII, which Savage lost. After the match Queen Sherri turned on him, which caused Miss Elizabeth to come from the crowd and save Savage. The actions turned Savage into a hero again, and he left the ring with Miss Elizabeth to a loud ovation from the crowd. Following Hogan's victory over Sgt. Slaughter to regain the WWF Championship at that same event, Savage served as a special guest referee for house show rematches between Hogan and Slaughter from June 30 through August 18. In each of the seven bouts, Hogan successfully retained the title after Slaughter attacked Savage only for Savage to return the favor, thereby assisting Hogan.\n\nOn November 16, 1991, Hogan was a guest on Paul Bearer's Funeral Parlor interview segment. When Hogan was attacked by The Undertaker and Ric Flair, Savage (along with Roddy Piper) saved Hogan from the beating.\n\nSavage returned to wrestling in 1992, and he and Hogan both competed in the 1992 Royal Rumble. The two tagged to defeat Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts and The Berzerker on a February 1 taping of \"WWF Superstars\". They teamed again at a house show on February 10 to defeat Roberts and The Undertaker. The Mega Powers reunited for one final time in the WWF on March 29, 1992 to defeat Ric Flair and Sid Justice by disqualification at a house show at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn, Michigan.\n\nHogan and Savage's real-life friendship unraveled in 1992 when Miss Elizabeth filed for divorce against Savage. In an interview with Radio WWF in 1993, Savage discussed the divorce, openly blaming Hogan and his then-wife Linda for turning Miss Elizabeth against him.\n\nAn urban legend was that Savage gave Hogan a black eye with a punch a few days before WrestleMania IX in 1993; however, Hogan stated in his autobiography the black eye came from a jet ski accident incurred days before the event. This was later confirmed in an interview with Mike Schiavello.\n\nHogan left the WWF in the summer of 1993, while Savage departed near the end of 1994.\n\nAfter Hogan and Savage patched up their real life differences, Hogan talked WCW president Eric Bischoff into signing Savage, who was increasingly unhappy with his diminishing role in the WWF. In his initial appearance on \"WCW Saturday Night\", Savage made reference on air to his love/hate relationship with Hogan and was ambiguous as to where his allegiance was. He aided Hogan at Starrcade 1994 and shook his hand, signalling their alliance. Jimmy Hart, who by this point was managing Hogan, began to manage the team. Initially called \"The Monster Maniacs\" (presumably for legal reasons), Hogan and Savage teamed on January 25, 1995 at Clash of the Champions XXX to battle Kevin Sullivan and The Butcher. Hart would turn on the team at Halloween Havoc 1995 to manage the Dungeon of Doom, a stable Sullivan would go on to form in the Summer of 1995 in an effort to improve his chances of ridding WCW of Hogan. On March 24, 1996 at Uncensored, The Mega Powers reunited to take on eight opponents in a Doomsday Cage Match. The opponents were Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Kevin Sullivan, Lex Luger, The Faces of Fear (The Barbarian and Meng), Z-Gangsta, and The Ultimate Solution. They were known as the Alliance to End Hulkamania. At Clash of the Champions XXXII on January 23, 1996 from Las Vegas, Nevada, the duo lost to Ric Flair and The Giant.\n\nThe team broke up again at Bash at the Beach on July 7, 1996. This time, it was Hogan who turned heel. Hogan came out seemingly to save Savage and Sting during their match with The Outsiders (Scott Hall and Kevin Nash); Hogan double-crossed Savage and Sting, dropping the leg on Savage three times, then forming the New World Order (nWo). WCW decided to work Hogan's and Savage's old real life feud into the storyline, going as far as having Hogan state that if Savage was going to accuse him of causing his divorce from Miss Elizabeth, then he \"doesn't need someone as ungrateful as 'The Macho Man' as a friend\". Later that year, the former friends faced off at Halloween Havoc for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Savage almost had Hogan beat, but thanks to Ted DiBiase and The Giant, Hogan retained the title and the nWo brutally beat Savage. Savage's ex-wife, Miss Elizabeth, who was aligned with the Four Horsemen at the time, begged Hogan to stop hurting Savage, who she still cared deeply about. She then covered his unconscious body to prevent anymore beatings and was spraypainted along with Savage.\n\nAfter losing to Hogan at Halloween Havoc, Savage went on hiatus. He returned to WCW in January 1997, joining Sting in the rafters, showing no alliance to either WCW or the nWo for a while. At SuperBrawl VII, Savage appeared ringside for the match between Hogan and Roddy Piper. Savage became a villain by slipping Hogan a pair of brass knuckles when the referee's back was turned. Hogan used the weapon en route to his very first pinfall victory over Piper, and after the match, Hogan and Savage brutalized Piper together.\n\nThe pair would team often, sometimes with the Outsiders, in tag matches with Savage now wearing similar wrestling attire to Hogan. However, in late 1997, after Hogan lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship to Sting, friction popped up between Savage and Hogan again, this time over who the leader of the nWo was. Hogan and Savage teamed for the final time in their careers on the February 16, 1998 edition of \"WCW Monday Nitro\", losing to Sting and Lex Luger by disqualification.\n\nA brief feud between Savage and fellow nWo member Kevin Nash ended when the two realized Hogan was playing them against each other to keep them away from chasing the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The feud came to a fever pitch when Savage took the title from Sting, only to have Hogan take it from him the next night. After that, the nWo split into two factions, with Hogan spearheading nWo Hollywood and Savage co-founding the nWo Wolfpac with Nash. The Outsiders split shortly after when Hall turned on Nash and joined up with nWo Hollywood.\n\nThe former Mega Powers teammates faced off for the last time when Savage lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship to Hogan on the July 12, 1999 episode of \"Nitro\".\n\nIn 2000, Hogan and other legends formed the WCW faction known as The Millionaire's Club. During one memorable brawl at the end of a television taping between the Club and their opponents, Savage suddenly ran out and lent the Club his aid, turning the tide and effectively becoming a member after tapping fists with Hogan once the fighting ended. Hogan and Savage had reverted to fan favorite status by this time. This ended quickly, however, as Hogan left WCW in July 2000 and Savage was not seen again before WCW folded in spring 2001.\n\nOn the March 29, 2010 episode of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's \"Impact!\" television show, Hogan met with \"Black Machismo\" Jay Lethal in his office. Lethal, whose character was inspired by Savage, made reference to the Mega Powers, placing himself in Savage's place as Hogan's partner. They even did the \"Mega Powers handshake\" at the end of the segment.\n\nOn the May 5, 2015 episode of \"Main Event\", Damien Sandow adopted a new \"Macho Mandow\" gimmick reminiscent of Savage's, with the same entrance music (Pomp and Circumstance) and similar attire. He then wrestled a match against Curtis Axel, whose \"AxelMania\" gimmick had elements similar to Hogan's; however, the match was interrupted by The Ascension. On the May 11, 2015 episode of \"Raw\", they had a rematch and were again interrupted by The Ascension; this time they fought off The Ascension together, and then shared a handshake reminiscent of the original Mega Powers. The team was later christened \"The Meta Powers\". At Payback, The Meta Powers were defeated by The Ascension. The Meta Powers angle was dropped on July 24, 2015, after WWE fired Hulk Hogan and severed all ties with him, although Sandow continued to use the Macho Man gimmick.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1957632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957632", "title": "Directorate of Ukraine", "text": "Directorate of Ukraine\n\nThe Directorate, or Directory (, \"Dyrektoriya\") was a provisional collegiate revolutionary state committee of the Ukrainian People's Republic, initially formed on November 13–14, 1918 during a session of the Ukrainian National Union in rebellion against Skoropadsky's regime. During the overthrow of Pavlo Skoropadsky it was named as the \"Executive Council of the State Affairs\" (). Its authority was extended by the Labor Congress of Ukraine on January 23–28, 1919.\n\nAfter unsuccessful attempts to gather members of the committee, it dissolved on November 10, 1920. On November 12, 1920 by the 'Law on the Temporary Supreme Authority and the Legislative System of the UNR' the executive council was reformed into a single person government position.\n\nThe Directorate was formed until a new council was to be elected to form the professional government. It was decided not to restore functioning of the Central Rada which was favored by the SR-centrists Mykhailo Hrushevsky and Vsevolod Holubovych. The new council, the Labor Congress, appointed the Directorate as the Extraordinary Government Body in the protection of the republic. It was charged to enact laws in the absence of the Labor Congress due to the political situation in the country, while the Council of the People's Ministers was invested with the executive powers. The Directorate consisted of five delegates from various parties and representation groups.\n\nVynnychenko left the government (10 February 1919) in the hope that the Directorate would establish friendly talks with representatives of the Entente while Petliura left the SDPists, thus demonstrating that the Ukrainian government had changed its political agenda and was not the same one that had signed the treaty in Brest-Litovsk on 9 February 1918. In light of that a new Prime Minister was appointed as well, Serhiy Ostapenko, who headed his non-socialist government from February 11, 1919. When talks failed Ostapenko was replaced by Borys Martos on April 9, 1919.\n\n\n\nOver two years (December 1918 to November 1920) there were five governments before the Directorate went into official exile at the end of 1920. Between 15 December and 25 December 1918 a stand-off took place between the Revolutionary Committee in Kiev and the provisional Executive Council of State Affairs (TRZDS) in Vinnytsia. It took couple of weeks before the new government was formed on December 26 headed by Volodymyr Chekhivsky as President of the Council of People's Ministers (Prime Minister).\n\nIn December 1918 Hetman of the Ukrainian State Pavlo Skoropadskyi was deposed and the Directorate was established.\n\nWith the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I, Skoropadsky could no longer rely on Germany and Austria-Hungary's support. On November 13, 1918 Skoropadky's opponents set up a rival body known as the Directorate, whose forces were headed by the newly reformed Sich Rifles. Most of Skoropadsky's troops joined with the Directorate during a month long the Ukrainian Civil War. Skoropadsky then turned to some of the Russian officers who were fighting alongside Denikin, forming them into a Special Corps, but these troops were not able to face the Directorate's troops. On December 19, 1918, the Directorate's troops took Kiev and overthrew Skoropadsky's regime.\n\nThe Directorate re-established the Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR). The new regime was torn between the pro-nationalistic, including the party of peasant-democrats, and the factions for the federal union with Russia. At the end the idea to reestablish the Central Rada was set aside as well as to recover all its legal acts yet the most important one were preserved. On December 26, 1918 the Directorate released its declaration to eliminate the Hetman regime.\n\nBy the end of 1918 the Directorate began to be dominated by the Ukrainian military leader, Symon Petliura.\n\nFaced by many enemies on all sides the UNR's army was organised to face each threat. To the North-east were the Bolsheviks, to the south-east were the Russian Whites, to the south-west Romanians who had claims on territory in Bucovina and Halychyna, and the French intervention force took Odessa in December 1918 to fill the power vacuum left by the withdrawing Austrians and Germans. Coming quickly to some understanding with the French and the Romanians, the UNR's army was able to employ more men on other fronts.\n\nWith major fighting breaking out in January 1919, the Ukrainians were pushed back and Kiev fell in February 1919. The government moved to Vinnytsia on February 5, 1919. A political trick took place that the Directorate tried to play with Volodymyr Vynnychenko resignation to demonstrate a change of powers in the Ukrainian government and maybe attain a possible acceptance with the Entente. Symon Petliura has left the party and replaced the Vynnychenko's position who was too well known. Petliura has assumed the position of the Directorate's chairman on February 11, 1919, a week after the government moved to Podillia. The talks, alias, were proved to be without results. By May 1919, the Directorate's armies had been squeezed into a narrow strip of land around Brody. Soviets then negotiated with the Poles, who were attacking the Ukrainians from behind, with this ceasefire, the Ukrainians were able to counter-attack and re-take Podilia and established a new capital in Kamianets-Podilskyi. In June, the UNR's forces were joined by the Western Ukrainian Republic's forces, who had been pushed out of Galicia by the Poles. During that time (May 1919), General Denikin and his white army launched an offensive against the Reds, during the summer and autumn of that year. The \"White Guards\" forces pushed the Reds out of the Central and Eastern Ukraine, thus, giving the Directorate another chance to reclaim Kiev. But the constant \"Red Guards\" counter-attacks and a deadly typhus epidemic caused the Petliura forces to be pushed out of Ukraine completely into the well established territory of Poland. A political crisis took place inside the Directorate members of which were heavily interfered in the affairs of the Council of People's Ministers. Because of that Shvets and Makarenko were sent on the state matters abroad. Later in May 1920 on the request of Petliura to return they did not reply and were dismissed.\n\nIn 1920, the Polish Army reorganized with the help from the two new Ukrainian divisions to prepare an offensive against the Denikin's forces. A UNR-Polish Treaty in April 1920 provided for combined operations between the two armies under overall Polish command while recognizing the Polish sovereignty over the territory of the former West Ukrainian People's Republic with the border passing along the Zbruch river. In the Soviet-Polish war of 1920, the Poles and Ukrainians advanced side by side, and the UNR was set up again when they re-took Kiev. But less than a month later the Soviet's summer counter-offensive left the Poles and Ukrainians retreating, an armistice was signed in late 1920. With this great disappointment, the UNR forces launched an attack on their own against the Reds from Polish territory, however that was quickly beaten. They were forced back into Galicia. In 1920 Poland concluded a border dispute by the Treaty of Riga with the Soviet Union, thus, canceling the Treaty of Warsaw (1920). The Treaty of Riga divided Western Ukraine among Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary and gave the Soviet Union control over the rest of (current) Ukraine (which became the Ukrainian SSR).\n\nAt the first stage the Directorate recovered all of the rights of peasants and workers that were established by the laws passed by the Central Rada: \"Until the complete solution of the Land Reform, the Directory of the Ukrainian People's Republic declares that all small peasant's holdings and all worker's holdings to be left for use of their previous owners, while the rest of lands to be transferred to the peasant with little or no land holdings with the priorities to those joined the Republican forces against the struggle with the former Hetman. The Supreme subordination over the land carries the Directory of the Ukrainian People's Republic. This statement concerns also the monastery, church, and government land holdings. For introduction of the Reform there was organized the People's Land Committee...\"\n\nThe Directorate canceled all the codes of the former Hetmanate government concerning workers policies. The eight-hour working day was reestablished as well as the practice of cooperative agreements, the rights on coalition and activist strikes, and various other normative acts.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The multi-arched bridge meets with Third Avenue in downtown Minneapolis at its south end, but curves as it crosses the river, and connects with Central Avenue on its north end. The shallow \"S\" curve in the bridge was built to avoid fractures in the limestone bedrock that supports the bridge piers. The road is also designated Minnesota State Highway 65. Construction began in 1914, and it opened four years later in 1918. The bridge, which uses Melan arches of an open spandrel design, has been modified since that time. The 2,223-foot (667.6 m) crossing was designed by city engineer Frederick W. Cappelen, who also created plans for other similar bridges in Minneapolis such as the Franklin Avenue Bridge. It cost US$862,254.00 at the time of construction.\n\nThe bridge underwent a major overhaul in 1979–1980. Another restoration is planned to extend its life 50 years with a new deck, and other improvements to barriers, railings, and lighting.

In 2003, Snoop Dogg, released his series of mixtapes, from which the second compilation \"Welcome to tha chuuch, Vol. 2\" included the first version of \"So Fly\", which is a parody of the then chart-running hit single by Monica, So Gone. Missy Elliott, a co-producer of the song (with Spike & Jamahl), got to hear the tape and was very impressed by it.

{"id": "1957643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957643", "title": "The Passion of the Jew", "text": "The Passion of the Jew\n\n\"The Passion of the Jew\" is the third episode of the eighth season and the 114th overall episode of the American animated series \"South Park\", originally broadcast on Comedy Central on March 31, 2004. It was written and directed by Trey Parker, who, along with fellow series co-creator Matt Stone, voiced most of the characters in the episode. \"The Passion of the Jew\" is a satirical critique of the media discourse and controversy surrounding Mel Gibson's 2004 film, \"The Passion of the Christ\".\n\nIn the episode, Kyle finally sees the blockbuster movie \"The Passion of the Christ\" and admits that Cartman has been right about the Jewish people all along. After Stan and Kenny see and hate the film, they angrily pursue Mel Gibson to get their money back.\n\nThe boys are playing \"Star Trek\" in Cartman's mother's new minivan and, as usual, the anti-Semitic Cartman gives Kyle a hard time about his Jewish heritage. Cartman dares Kyle to watch \"The Passion of the Christ\", the box-office success of which Cartman cites as proof that everybody hates the Jews. Kyle sees the film and is horrified by its violent depiction of how Jesus was tortured and crucified. Kyle feels intense guilt and has nightmares in which he and other Jews laugh while killing Jesus. He tells Cartman that he was \"right all along\" about the Jews; overjoyed, Cartman prays to a poster of \"The Passion\"'s director Mel Gibson and vows to dedicate his life to promoting the film and \"organiz[ing] the masses ... to do thy bidding\". Meanwhile, Stan and Kenny watch \"The Passion\" and hate it. Declaring it a \"snuff film\", they demand their eighteen dollars back from the theater, but are told that they can only get their money back from Gibson.\n\nAttempting to contact Gibson, Stan and Kenny telephone the head of the Mel Gibson Fan Club—Cartman, who yells at them for disliking the film, but lets slip that Gibson lives in Malibu. Stan and Kenny make their way there. Meanwhile Cartman dresses in a brown Hitler-esque uniform and hosts a fan club meeting in his backyard. The attendees have gathered to celebrate \"The Passion\", which they say helped them rediscover Christianity. Cartman suggests that each attendee take one more person to see the film before they begin what he refers to as \"the cleansing\"—the fan club members obliviously agree.\n\nWhen Stan and Kenny reach Gibson's house, the director rambles, straps himself to a rack wearing only underwear and says that no matter how much they torture him he will never refund their money. When the boys insist that they just want their money back, Gibson chases them around the house with a gun, à la \"Looney Tunes\", appearing behind doors as various versions of Daffy Duck's disguises. Stan and Kenny take eighteen dollars from Gibson's wallet (actually twenty dollars, but Kenny offers up two dollars for change) and flee on a bus home. Gibson, wearing face paint from \"Braveheart\", chases their bus in the tanker truck from \"Mad Max 2\", screaming \"Qapla'!\" and \"Gimme back my money!\" Back in South Park, Kyle talks to Father Maxi about his issues regarding Jesus and the guilt he has been feeling since seeing Gibson's film. Father Maxi points out that the Passion was originally a play used to stir up anti-Semitism, but says that its subject matter can still help people. Kyle seizes on Father Maxi's statement that \"Christianity is about atonement\" and says he now understands what he should do.\n\nAt another fan club rally outside the South Park theater, Cartman shouts hateful slogans in German and gives the attendees lines to shout back; mistaking the German for the Aramaic spoken in \"The Passion\", they happily do so and join Cartman in goose-stepping through South Park shouting anti-Semitic slogans. Meanwhile, Kyle suggests at his synagogue that the Jewish community should apologize for Jesus' crucifixion, prompting uproar in the congregation. The rabbi tries to calm the situation, saying \"we live in a rational community, and everybody knows this is just a movie\", but just then, Cartman and his parade pass the synagogue.\n\nHorrified, the rabbi and congregation go to the theater and demand that they stop showing \"The Passion\". Their argument with Cartman and his followers is interrupted by the arrival of the truck chase—Gibson crashes into the theater, destroying it. When he emerges unscathed, Cartman rushes to worship him, but Gibson ignores him and, rambling, first attempts one final time to force Stan and Kenny to give him his money back (which fails, as they refuse), and then smears his own excrement on a building, much to the astonishment of Kyle and the fan club members. Stan says that Christians should follow Jesus' teachings and not focus on how he died. The fans agree and disperse, much to Cartman's dismay. Kyle says he feels better about his Jewishness after hearing Stan's speech and seeing Gibson, who defecates on Cartman's face and runs off whooping.\n\nThe poster of Mel Gibson on Cartman's wall is from Gibson's 1995 film \"Braveheart\". On Stan and Kenny's way out to get their money back for \"The Passion\", Stan remarks \"This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible. This is just like when we got our money back for \"BASEketball\".\" \"BASEketball\" is a 1998 comedy film in which Parker and Stone starred. The way Gibson behaves while chasing Stan and Kenny through his mansion is reminiscent of \"Looney Tunes\", particularly Daffy Duck. Gibson saying \"Two days ago, I saw a vehicle that would haul that tanker. You want to get out of here? You talk to me\" is a famous quote of his Mad Max character in the 1981 film \"Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior\". His \"Kapla!\" stems from after the \"Defiance of the English Tyranny\" speech from \"Braveheart\".\n\n\"The New York Times\"' Virginia Heffernan praised the episode, writing \"Depending on whom you asked, that episode, 'The Passion of the Jew,' proved that the show's still got it or that it's made a comeback or that it's better than ever. In any case, it was good.\" It was also praised by the Anti-Defamation League and the Jewish newspaper \"The Jewish Daily Forward\", which called it \"perhaps the most biting critique of 'The Passion' to date.\"\n\nBesides appearing on the \"South Park\" complete eighth season DVD set, \"Passion of the Jew\" is also available as a standalone DVD release (which was released on DVD the same day that the DVD of the \"Passion of the Christ\" was released) with two bonus episodes: season six's \"Red Hot Catholic Love\" and season seven's \"Christian Rock Hard\".\n\n"}

He is currently the goalkeeper coach of Rapid Wien.\n\nMacho started his first-team career with Wiener Sport-Club in 1996, and moved after one season to First Vienna FC, where he spent three seasons before leaving for Premier League club Sunderland in 2000.\n\nAt Sunderland, Macho spent three seasons as the second-choice keeper, behind Danish international Thomas Sørensen, and managed a total of 22 league appearances. He then transferred to Chelsea for the 2003–04 season, but was mostly fourth-choice there. He suffered a serious season-long injury, and subsequently failed to make a single competitive appearance with the team.\n\nIn August 2004, having been released from the remaining year of his Chelsea contract, Macho left the club to join Austrian Bundesliga side SK Rapid Wien, on what was scheduled to be a year-long loan deal. However, he spent just four months there, managing eight league appearances, as well as two in the UEFA Cup.\n\nIn January 2005, Macho joined Germany's 1. FC Kaiserslautern, where he first spent six months as the third-choice, behind Tim Wiese and Thomas Ernst. However, he managed to become the starter in 2005–06, as Wiese left for SV Werder Bremen. He subsequently made a total of 20 league appearances that season, but missed nearly the entire second part of the season due to an injury.

{"id": "1957708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957708", "title": "Vahana", "text": "Vahana\n\nVahana (, , literally \"that which carries, that which pulls\") denotes the being, typically an animal or mythical entity, a particular Hindu deity is said to use as a vehicle. In this capacity, the vahana is often called the deity's \"mount\". Upon the partnership between the deity and his vahana is woven much iconography and mythology. Deities are often depicted riding (or simply mounted upon) the vahana. Other times, the vahana is depicted at the deity's side or symbolically represented as a divine attribute. The vahana may be considered an accoutrement of the deity: though the vahana may act independently, they are still functionally emblematic or even syntagmatic of their \"rider\". The deity may be seen sitting or standing on the vahana. They may be sitting on a small platform called a \"howdah\", or riding on a saddle or bareback. \"Vah\" in Sanskrit means \"to ride along the land\".\n\nIn Hindu iconography, positive aspects of the vehicle are often emblematic of the deity that it carries. Nandi the bull, vehicle of Shiva, represents strength and virility. Dinka the mouse, vehicle of Ganesha, represents speed and sharpness. Parvani the peacock, vehicle of Skanda, represents splendor and majesty. The hamsa, vehicle of Saraswati, represents wisdom, grace and beauty.\n\nHowever, the vehicle animal also symbolizes the evil forces over which the deity dominates. Mounted on Parvani, Skanda reins in the peacock's vanity. Seated on Dinka the rat (Mushika), Ganesh crushes useless thoughts, which multiply like rats in the dark. Shani, protector of property, has a vulture, raven or crow in which he represses thieving tendencies. Under Shani's influence, the vahana can make even malevolent events bring hope.\n\nThe vehicle of a deity can vary according to the source, the time, and the place. In popular tradition, the origin of each vehicle is told in thousands of different ways. Three examples:\n\nThe vahana and deity to which they support are in a reciprocal relationship. Vahana serve and are served in turn by those who engage them. Many vahana may also have divine powers or a divine history of their own. Case in point, the aforementioned Nataraja story, represents a of Hindu gods with local gods, syncretizing their mythos as their territories began to overlap. According to one source, \"they could be a synthesis between Vedic deities and autochthonous Dravidian totemic deities.\n\nThe animal correspondences of Hindu vehicles are not consistent with Greek and Roman mythology, or other belief systems which may tie a particular animal to a particular deity. For example, the goddess Lakshmi of the Hindus has elephants, or an owl, or (a rare instance of a non-animal vehicle) the lotus blossom as her vehicle. The goddess Athena of ancient Greece also had an owl as her emblematic familiar, but the meanings invested in the owls by the two different belief systems are not the same, nor are the two goddesses themselves similar, despite their mutual identification with owls.\n\nLakshmi is, among other things, primarily the goddess of wealth, and her owl is a warning against distrust and isolationism, even selfishness. Athena, though also a goddess of prosperity, is primarily the goddess of wisdom, and her owl symbolizes secret knowledge and scholarship. Perhaps due to their shared geography, the Greco-Roman interpretation is paralleled in Roman Catholic iconography, in which St. Jerome, most famed for editing the New Testament, is often (though not always) depicted with an owl as a symbol of wisdom and scholarship. Depending on the tribe, Native American religious iconography attributes a wide range of attributes to the owl, both positive and negative, as do the Ainu and Russian cultures, but none parallel the Hindu attributes assigned to the owl as Lakshmi's divine vehicle.\n\nSome hold that similar analyses could be performed cross-culturally for any of the other Hindu divine vehicles, and in each case, any parallels with the values assigned to animal totems in other cultures are likely to be either coincidence, or inevitable (as in linking bulls to virility), rather than evidence of parallel development. In dialectic, this is countered by the retort that each totem or vahana, as an aspect of \"ishta-devata\" (or an \"ishta-devata\" or \"asura\" in its own right), has innumerable ineffable teachings, insights and spiritual wisdom; comparative analysis yields benefit, though knowledge and understanding is not served by collapsing their qualities into homogenous signification.\n\nThese correspondences are not always consistent. Ganesh, for example, is sometimes shown with a peacock as his vehicle, although a peacock is the customary vehicle of his brother Kartikeya (also known as Murugan, Subramanya, Skanda and other names) as well as the vehicle sometimes associated with the goddess Saraswati. Even more rarely, the elephant-headed Ganesh may be seen riding another elephant, or a lion, or a many-headed serpent.\n\nAs the \"vahana\", the mount or vehicle of a deity, serves the function of doubling a God's or Goddess' powers. The vahana also represents the devotee's mind which allows the deity to guide the devotee. Durga the warrioress could not have destroyed the demon Mahishasura without the aid of her vehicle, lion, which was given by her father Himalaya, for the stated purpose. Lakshmi, goddess of fortune, dispenses both material and spiritual riches from her mount, Uluka the owl. Ganesh, remover of obstacles, cannot go everywhere despite his elephant-like strength. However, his vehicle, Mushika the mouse, who can crawl into the smallest crevice or Akhuketana the rat, who can survive just about anywhere, can assist Ganesh to overcome the greatest obstacles.\n\n\n"}

The school is widely regarded as one of the most diverse schools in Auckland, having students of over 70 different nationalities including approximately 120 International students. The school has been noted by media for its rising academic success and exceptional performance for its low socio-economic decile.\n\nIn 1957 the school was granted its own board of governors and adopted the emblem of the Phoenix with the motto 'Sursum' meaning 'To the Heights'. The Phoenix was chosen for its symbolism of the pursuit of excellence and periodic renewal and revitalization.\n\nThe school has had several structural improvements, such as the construction of new buildings such as the Science Block, the Maclean Centre, T-Block, renovation of H-Block (including the Year 13 Common Room - a room with lockers, kitchen appliances, and recreation features dedicated to final year students), and the new gymnasium and classrooms. At the end of 2009, a new Pastoral Care Centre was built and opened in 2010. Rebuilding of the school's C-Block finished late 2010. In 2016, the new Olympic-grade hockey turf was completed. \n\nThe Maclean Centre for disabled students was opened in 1977, named in honour of Mr B H Maclean, Principal from 1966-1981. The Centre moved into a new building in 2003 and the staff and students are fully involved in all areas of school life.\n\nThe school has a very proud academic record, with top scholarship results comparable to other higher-decile schools in Auckland, despite the fact that it is a decile 4 school. Mount Roskill Grammar School has been described by the New Zealand Herald in 2007 as the \"\"best public school in New Zealand\"\". In 2009 Metro Magazine has also ranked MRGS as the top school in Auckland, saying \"\"Mt Roskill is not uniquely gifted; it has to work hard to get the results it does. But it was in the top 10 for every indicator we looked at, and usually it was first or second. In general its academic results were what you would expect of a decile-9 school.\"\".\n\nThe school has 10 computer labs catering for students from Year 9-13. Mount Roskill Grammar operates under a strict contract, which every student signs, so that these technologies are not abused. Mount Roskill Grammar is also one of the schools participating in the Phase 2 of the Beacon Practice from GIF Technology Education initiative.\n\nIn 2013, 90.7 percent of students leaving Mount Roskill Grammar held at least NCEA Level 1, 82.5 percent held at least NCEA Level 2, and 58.3 percent held at least University Entrance. This is compared to 85.2%, 74.2%, and 49.0% respectively for all students nationally.\n\nMount Roskill Grammar School offers sports, music and other extracurricular activities. Notably there are culture groups in Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Kapa haka, Tongan, Samoan, Tokelauan, Niuean and Cook Islands culture. The Indian Dance group won the 2007 Annual Bollywood Highschool Dance Competition.\n\nThe Boys Chorus (Mr G's Boys Chorus) was actively involved in Barbershop Music, winning a record of 5 consecutive Auckland Regional titles in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 as well as the New Zealand National Young Singers in Harmony Championships in 2002, 2005 and 2006. The school at that time was the only school in New Zealand to have won 3 National Championships, and 2 consecutively.\n\nAs of 2017, Mount Roskill Grammar School has 5 houses which have been named after famous New Zealanders - Rutherford (Red), Ngata (Orange), Sheppard (Yellow), Hillary (Green) And Cooper (Blue). Junior students are placed into house groups through their core classes, senior students remain in the houses they were in during year 10.\n\n\nIn 2017 the school was twice the winner of the High School League Premier Division Championships.\n\nIn 2018, Mount Roskill adopted a completely gender-neutral uniform for its students.\n\n\nIn 1995 the school adapted peer-mediated programme called \"Cool Schools\" and with support from Peace Foundation had trained 200 of 2100 students to be mediators in Years 11 through 12. This programme is now the largest student mediation programme in New Zealand.\n\nIn March 2010, Mt Roskill Grammar School appeared on the TV3 Consumer Rights program \"Target\" regarding the introduction of their new uniform and the three year phase-in time, a costly introduction to parents of existing students. It was met with opposition by the student body but Greg Watson, the principal, pleaded ignorance to the issue and has stated that he had received positive support regarding it. Watson has not informed the school if a change will be made to the way the new school uniform will be introduced.\n\nOn 16 March 2011, Campbell Live, a TV3 current affairs programme aired an interview on bullying at Mount Roskill Grammar where a member of the study body had been bullied to a point that she spent \"12 lessons in the Dean’s office or the administration area across a 7-day period\". The school since resolved the matter.\n\nIn 2010s the school scrubbed its girls' rugby team due to fighting but brought it under control by 2015.\n\n"}

It is considered medically significant for a number of reasons, in both humans and animals, including sex determination and as a marker of endocrine disruptor exposure. It is regulated by dihydrotestosterone, which can be disrupted by phthalates common in plastics. Such endocrine disruption may affect the development of the brain.\n\nStudies show that the human perineum is twice as long in males as in females, but males have more variance. Measuring the anogenital distance in neonatal humans has been suggested as a noninvasive method to determine male feminisation and thereby predict neonatal and adult reproductive disorders.\n\nA study by Swan et al. determined that the AGD is linked to fertility in males, and penis size. Males with a short AGD (lower than the median around 52 mm (2 in)) have seven times the chance of being sub-fertile as those with a longer AGD. It is linked to both semen volume and sperm count. A lower than median AGD also increases the likelihood of undescended testes, and lowered sperm counts and testicular tumors in adulthood. Babies with high total exposure to phthalates were ninety times more likely to have a short AGD, despite not every type of the nine phthalates tested being correlated with shorter AGD.\n\nSwan et al. report that the levels of phthalates associated with significant AGD reductions are found in approximately one-quarter of Americans tested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for phthalate body burdens.\n\nWomen who had high levels of phthalates in their urine during pregnancy gave birth to sons who were ten times more likely to have shorter than expected AGDs.\n\nA 2018 study by Barrett et al. found that infant girls born to women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) had longer AGD, suggesting higher fetal testosterone exposure, than girls born to women without PCOS.\n\nHypospadias and cryptorchidism are conditions which may be induced in males with short AGD.\nOther problems in males include risk of testicular dysgenesis syndrome.\n\nThere have been extensive studies of AGD effects on animals. In some animals it is routinely measured to determine health.\n\nExperiments have demonstrated that in rodent studies this distance is shortened when the mother is exposed to chemicals that are anti-androgenic, such as dibutyl phthalate (DBP) or benzyl butyl phthalate (BBzP).\n\nBisphenol A in certain doses increases the AGD of both genders of a study on mice.\n\nIn 2017, Gobikrushanth et al. studied the relationship between AGD (the distance from the center of the anus to the base of the clitoris) and fertility in Canadian Holstein cows and found that first and second parity cows with long AGD had poorer fertility outcomes compared to those with long AGD. \n\nThe \"anogenital index\" (AGI) is an index used to measure the AGD. It is computed as the AGD divided by weight [AGI = AGD/weight (mm/kg)].\n\nThe AGD is measured as follows: from the center of the anus to the posterior convergence of the fourchette (where the vestibule begins) in females; and from the center of the anus to the junction of the smooth perineal skin with the rugated skin of the scrotum in males.\n\n"}

She founded the Women's Political Education League in 1902 which campaigned successfully to raise the age of consent to sixteen.\n\nScott was the daughter of Helenus Scott (1802–1879) and Sarah Ann Scott (née Rusden) aka Saranna, the fifth of eight children, and a granddaughter of Helenus Scott (1760–1821), a Scottish physician. Her cousins were the naturalists Harriet Morgan (née Scott) and Helena Scott. She was educated at home with her closest sister Augusta. From an early age, Rose Scott was influenced by injustices she perceived towards women in history and literature such as Joan of Arc and Katerina in \"The Taming of the Shrew\".\n\nIn 1882, Scott began to hold a weekly salon in her Sydney home. Through these meetings, she became well known amongst politicians, judges, philanthropists, writers and poets. In 1889, she helped to found the Women's Literary Society, which grew into the Womanhood Suffrage League of New South Wales in 1891. Speaking at committee meetings gave her confidence, and she eventually became an accomplished public speaker. In April 1892 she participated in a public debate with fellow suffragist Eliza Ashton on Ashton's controversial views on marriage.\n\nScott's mother died in 1896, and she was left with a home and sufficient income for her needs. Her interest in votes for women led to much study of the position of women in the community, and she found that young girls were working in shops from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. on ordinary days, and until 11 p.m. on Saturdays. Some of these girls were asked to come to her house on Saturday and describe the conditions in which they worked, and there leading politicians such as Bernhard Wise, William Holman, W. M. Hughes and Thomas Bavin met and discussed the drafting of the bill that eventually became the early closing act of 1899.\n\nOther reforms advocated, and eventually implemented, were the appointment of matrons at police stations and of women inspectors in factories and shops, and improvements in the conditions of women prisoners.\n\nScott founded and became the first President of the Women's Political Education League in 1902, a position she held until 1910. The League established branches throughout the state and consistently campaigned for the issue closest to Scott's heart: raising the age of consent from 14 to 16, achieved in 1910 with the Crimes (Girls' Protection) Act. She was also President of the Sydney Branch of the Peace Society in 1908. Other post-suffrage feminist reform campaigns she participated in included the Family Maintenance and Guardianship of Infants (1916), Women's Legal Status (1918) and First Offenders (Women) 1918 Acts.\n\nShe was also, for many years, international secretary of the National Council of Women in New South Wales. When she retired in 1921, a presentation of money was made to her which she used to found a prize for female law students, \"The Rose Scott Prize for Proficiency at Graduation\" \"by a Woman Candidate\", at Sydney University. Another subscription was made to have her portrait painted by John Longstaff. This now hangs in the art gallery at Sydney. Scott was opposed to Federation and conscription. She was an Anglican pacifist.\n\nShe died from cancer on 20 April 1925 at her home, Lynton, in Jersey Road, Woollahra.\n\nRose Scott Circuit, in the Canberra suburb of Chisholm, is named in her honour.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1957787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957787", "title": "Vinyl siding", "text": "Vinyl siding\n\nVinyl siding is plastic exterior siding for houses and small apartment buildings, used for decoration and weatherproofing, imitating wood clapboard, board and batten or shakes, and used instead of other materials such as aluminum or fiber cement siding. It is an engineered product, manufactured primarily from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin. In the UK and New Zealand a similar material is known as uPVC weatherboarding.\n\nApproximately 80 percent of its weight is PVC resin, with the remaining 20 percent being ingredients that impart color, opacity, gloss, impact resistance, flexibility, and durability. It is the most commonly installed exterior cladding for residential construction in the United States and Canada.\n\nVinyl siding was introduced to the exterior market in the late 1950s as a replacement for aluminum siding. It was first produced by an independently owned manufacturing plant called Crane Plastics in Columbus, Ohio. The process was originally done through mono-extrusion, a process of forming the profile from a single material into the desired shape and size. At that time, blending of colors was done manually.\n\nThis original process made it difficult to produce and install a consistent, quality product. Beginning in the 1970s, the industry changed its formulation to improve the product's production speed, impact resistance, and range of colors. In the following decade, vinyl siding grew steadily in popularity in large part due to its durability, versatility, and ease of maintenance.\n\nToday, vinyl siding is manufactured by co-extrusion. Two layers of PVC are laid down in a continuous extrusion process; the top layer is weatherable and durable material, which comprises up to 25% of the siding thickness. This capstock can include about 10% titanium dioxide, depending on the color, which is a pigment and provides resistance to breakdown from UV light. Vinyl siding that is exposed to the sun will begin to fade over time. However, the fade rate is slower with vinyl than most other claddings. Most manufacturers offer 50 year warranties that their products will not fade much over that period of time. In the past darker colors tended to fade more than lighter ones, but advancements in technology and materials can mean this is no longer the case.\n\nThe lower layer, known as substrate, is typically about 15% ground limestone (which is largely calcium carbonate). The limestone reduces cost, and also balances the titanium dioxide, keeping both extrusion streams equally fluid during manufacturing. A small quantity of tin mercaptan or butadiene is added as a stabilizer to chemically tie up any hydrochloric acid that is released into the PVC material as the siding ages. Lubricants are also added to aid in the manufacturing process.\n\nVinyl siding can be observed in a wide range of product quality realized in a substantial difference in thickness and lasting durability. Thickness can vary from .035\" in cheaper grade siding products up to .052\" in the highest grade products which vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. Today, the thinnest vinyl siding commonly used is .040\", and is known as \"builder's grade\". Vinyl product can vary in thickness even within one manufacturer up to .010\" of thickness through varying product lines offered that range from basic to premium-grade products. Thicker vinyl products, usually realized in higher cost, are more rigid which can add to the aesthetic appeal and look of the installed, inherently flexible product and also add to durability and life expectancy. Thicker grades of vinyl siding \"may\", according to some, exhibit more resistance to the most common complaint about vinyl siding – its tendency to crack in very cold weather when it is struck or bumped by a hard object while others feel that a thinner product may allow more 'flex before cracking' and is a subject of debate. However, at \"This Old House\" website, this assertion about thickness and crack resistance is disputed. They claim to know of test results that indicate chemical makeup has a greater influence on impact resistance than does thickness.\n\nChemical formulas can also vary somewhat from manufacturer to manufacturer which can impact life expectancy as formulas and possibly manufacture process can be one of the most important in terms of product quality and durability. One important advent was a UV \"coating\", utilized by some manufacturers that was applied to the surface of the product that filters out UV spectral light from the sun which would otherwise degrade the PVC more quickly.\n\nVinyl siding is manufactured with its own partial fastening or locking system that is coupled with nails that 'loose' fasten the product to the exterior wall. This locking system can be either a rolled or an extruded lock depending on the manufacturing process, either of which has its own design considerations. This locking system, either extruded or rolled has a bottom lock which locks into either a start piece or onto the top lock of the panel below. The top lock is then 'loose' nailed to hold the panel to the wall. This 'loose' nailing allows for float which is created by expansion and contraction from varying temperature and weather conditions. With well designed siding, and proper 'loose nailing' installation, the siding can easily expand up, down, in and out, and left and right without restriction. Vinyl siding, by its nature, will tend to expand and contract more with temperature extremes than any other common type of cladding.\n\nVinyl siding features a chlorine base, making it inherently slow to ignite and flame retardant. All organic materials (that is, anything containing carbon) will ignite, but the higher the temperature a material has to reach before it flames, the safer it is. PVC won’t ignite, even from another flame, until it reaches about 730 °F (387 °C) and won’t self-ignite until about 850 °F (454 °C). Those ignition temperatures are significantly higher than common framing lumber, which ignites from a flame at 500 °F (260 °C) and self-ignites at 770 °F (410 °C). Also, ASTM D2863 tests show that rigid PVC’s high Limiting Oxygen Index means that it needs unusually high amounts of oxygen to burn and stay burning. Rigid PVC (vinyl siding) will not independently sustain combustion in air with a normal concentration of oxygen (about 21 percent) — so it extinguishes more easily.\n\nBecause of its thin profile, vinyl siding may be more likely to ignite due to exterior fire; for example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology found that, in tests involving vinyl-clad structures in close proximity, fire was observed to spread between two vinyl-clad test structures located six feet apart in fewer than five minutes. Additionally, vinyl siding can release toxic fumes when burning, particularly dioxins, and smoke containing high amounts of Hydrochloric acid. This is not only an environmental concern, but the fumes can be dangerous to firefighters and bystanders, and the toxic fumes released may increase the likelihood of fatality from smoke inhalation for anyone trapped in the burning structure.\n\nThe National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) recommends using building materials that require \"no additional finish resources to complete application on site\" for green home builders as they reduce waste and materials used. Installing vinyl siding involves neither paint, stain, nor caulk and thus meets this NAHB requirement. Though vinyl siding does actually require caulk to seal seams where the siding J (border trim that the sliding slides into) meets windows and doors.\n\nThe Environmental Building News validated the issues raised by Greenpeace and said it was not the only organization with environmental and health concerns about vinyl. They emphasized the risks of additives like the plasticizer DEHP.\n\nThe position of the International Association of Firefighters, which represents fire fighters in the U.S. and Canada is: \"Due to its intrinsic hazards, we support efforts to identify and use alternative building materials that do not pose as much risk as PVC to fire fighters, building occupants or communities.\" \n\nThe PVC used in vinyl siding used to be produced in open vats until 1971, when angiosarcoma, a rare cancer of the liver, was traced to vinyl chloride exposure among PVC workers, and strict workplace exposure limits were established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. These changes required all vats to be tightly sealed, which led to greater capital costs and a concentration in the number of producers.\n"}

In 1880 Dučić was appointed as the head of the National Museum of Serbia, and since 1883 as a Director of National Library of Serbia.\n\nDučić's monographs about monasteries (Tvrdoš, Žitomislić, Morača, Ostrog) have not lost the cultural-historical value since science must further take some studies into consideration: \"Christmas in Montenegro\" (1867); \"Boka and Zeta\" (1875); \"Slav Manuscripts in the National Library in Paris\" (1889).\n\nNićifor Dučić was born in the village of Velji Lug, near Trebinje in southern Bosnia and Herzegovina, in 1832. He received an excellent education in Serbia, Serbian Vojvodina, and later in Paris. During the 1848 Revolution he joined the Austrians as a young volunteer, and after he returned to his native Herzegovina where at the Duži Monastery he took holy orders under the guidance of his uncle, the abbot (archimandrite). In 1858 he founded with Serafim Perović a school in Duži, and taught religion and history in Mostar. From late 1858 until 1860he oversaw the Žitomislić Monastery, situated near the River Neretva. There he wrote several series of monographs, literary histories, archaeological questions, including the history of Metox Monastery Duži and Tvrdoš, Žitomislić Monastery, Hilandar Monastery, and about the Serbian community and the Serbian Orthodox Church of Saint Spiridon in downtown Trieste.\n\nIn 1848 in Žitomislić Monastery was founded the first school for education of Serbian children and a school for education of Orthodox priests, which were established by monks of the manastir, chiefly Nićifor Dučić and Sirafin Perović.\n\nDučić himself served in his youth in the Herzegovinian Uprising of 1852-1862, led by Luka Vukalović. Dučić's strength, daring and activity fitted him to shine in operations largely composed of night marches, surprises, escalades, and hand-to-hand combat. The main scene of his achievement was in Bosnia and Herzegovina and when those hostilities died down, and there was no amnesty forthcoming from the Ottoman Porte and Constantinople as promised, Dučić left for Montenegro. He had a relation in Cetinje where he settled in 1864. There he was elevated to the rank of archimandrite, and he also helped Serafim Perović, his old friend from Duži, start a school of higher learning. When Perović opened the first seminary at Cetinje, Dučić was named rector. He wrote and published the rules of the school. Conditions for the pupils were favourable, with particular considerations for the poorest among them. He also entered into Montenegrin service, and was immediately nominated to head a diplomatic mission as an intermediary between Cetinje and Belgrade.\n\nReturning with general Milojko Lešjanin, Nićifor Dučić, now Nicholas I of Montenegro's envoy, exchanged copies of a treaty with Mihailo Obrenović III, Prince of Serbia and Prime Minister Ilija Garašanin signed October 14, 1867. Its stated purpose was to \"\"prepare an insurrection in Turkey and unite the entire Serbian people in a single state.\"\" His pamphlets and revolutionary doctrines (that came to Austrian and Turkish attention) compelled him to leave Montenegro for Italy.\nTravelling about the Serbian communities in diaspora, Dučić had an opportunity to become personally acquainted with the strong patriotic feelings of these scattered Serbs, which would eventually give his observations all the more weight. In the meantime, Garašanin was preparing a general rising of all Serb lands against Turkish rule, and in 1868 Dučić was back in Belgrade. But the execution of Garašanin's plans was frustrated by the assassination of Prince Mihailo (Obrenović) on the 10th of June 1868 (or the 28th of May 1868 O.S.). Dučić was long a warm advocate of the political union of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbian Vojvodina, Kosovo Metohija, and Serbia.\n\nWith the accession of Prince Milan I of Serbia, the newly appointed prime minister Jovan Ristić employed Dučić for secret missions on behalf the Government, such as negotiating with the Turks. During September 1873, as Ristić's envoy, Dučić held consultations with Croatian politicians Matija Mrazović and Franjo Rački about the unification of all Serbian people with Serbia.\n\nNicifor Dučić and count Petar Vukotić had become champions of the idea of friendship and alliance with Serbia and favoured the unification of Montenegro with Serbia. They and Prince Nicholas believed that Montenegro's policy must be subject to Serbia's and that Serbian nation's salvation lays in complete unification with the rest of lands inhabited by Serbs. Filip Hristić arrived in Cetinje from Belgrade to assure Prince Nicholas that Serbia will back Montenegro in case of war with Turkey. Soon the war was declared in 1876 by Serbia in alliance with Montenegro in order to profit by the new insurrection in the Herzegovina which had begun in the summer of 1875 at Nevesinje. Dučić's love of adventure led him, during the First Serbo-Turkish War (1876–1878), to take the command of a brigade and enter into the fray. In this capacity he performed splendid service at Aleksinac, where he was wounded, by delaying Turkish advance on Belgrade before a conclusion of peace could be drawn up. The final result of the war which intensified the Balkan crisis culminated in the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878). By the settlement of the conflict Serbia and Montenegro acquired their respective and total independence from the Ottoman Empire. He died at Belgrade in 1900.\n\nHe was awarded several medals for bravery, Order of Saint Sava, Order of Miloš the Great, Order of the White Eagle, Order of the Cross of Takovo, Order of Saint Vladimir and Bulgarian Order for civil service.\n\nThough one of the most remarkable of Serbian writers, historians and diplomatists, Nićifor Dučić laboured for many years in comparative obscurity. Dučić began to write early, and had, according to his own account, composed several articles when he was sixteen. As a contributor to newspapers and magazines, he came under the notice of Ilarion Ruvarac, who encouraged him to continue to produce well-researched historical monographs for learned societies and their periodicals and journals. He wrote a treatise about Serbs living in the port city of Trieste, entitled \"\"The Serbian Parish in Trieste\"\".\n\nNjegoš's poetic works remained practically unrecognized and unnoticed by our littérateurs for more than two decades, until Nićifor Dučić wrote: \"Primjetbe na \"Komentar Gorskog vijenca\"\" (Belgrade, Državna Štamparija, 1870).\n\nDučić once complained: \"The Greek metropolitans ordain as clergy even such people as can hardly read the church books.\" (\"Istorija srpske pravoslavne crkve od prvijeh desetina VII viejeka to nasih dana,\" Beograd, 1892).\n\nIn 1869 Dučić became a member of the a Serbian Learned Society, and for a time held the post of director (librarian) of the Serbian National Library, from 1880 to 1886.\n\nBetween 1891 and 18 99 Dučić himself published his collected works with total of nine books. The study \"The Old Times of Hilandar and the Monograph of Hilandar\" was published in 1884 and then it was included into the fourth book of collected works in 1895.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1957829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957829", "title": "Greek Australians", "text": "Greek Australians\n\nGreek Australians (, ) comprise Australians who have full or partial Greek heritage or people who sought asylum as refugees after the Greek Civil War or emigrated from Greece and reside in Australia. The 2016 census recorded 397,431 people of Hellenic/ Greek ancestry, and 93,740 born in Greece, making Australia home to one of the largest Greek communities in the world.\n\nGreeks are the seventh largest ethnic group in Australia. In the 2011 census, 378,270 people reported to have Greek ancestry, either exclusively or in combination with another ethnic group, up from 365,147 in the 2006 census which recorded 125,849 people born in Greece. Also, the 2016 census recorded 16,929 people born in Cyprus and 28,991 people with Cypriot ancestry (many of whom are Greek Cypriots). The 2011 census recorded 18,070 people born in Cyprus and 22,680 people with Cypriot ancestry. The 2006 census recorded 18,369 people born in Cyprus and 29,005 people of Cypriot ancestry. Greeks, Cypriots and Vlachs in Australia collectively total 422,234 people.\nHowever, it is also well known within the Hellenic/ Greek community that many in the younger generation do not publicly identify themselves due to racial overtones. Similarly, people such as Hugh Jackman only identified as being part Greek in recent years.\n\nGreek immigration to Australia has been one of the largest migratory flows in the history of Australia, especially after World War II and Greek Civil War. As of 2015 the flow of migrants from Greece has in fact increased due to the economic crisis in Greece, with Australia as one of the main destinations, mainly to Melbourne where the Greek Australian community is most established.\n\nGreek immigration to Australia began in the early colonial period in the 19th century. The first known Greeks arrived in 1829. These Greeks were seven sailors, convicted of piracy by a British naval court, and were sentenced to transportation to New South Wales. Though eventually pardoned, two of those seven Greeks stayed and settled in the country. One settled on the Monaro Plains in Southern New South Wales and one at Picton near Sydney. Their names were Ghikas Bulgaris known as Jigger Bulgari, and Andonis Manolis. Jigger Bulgari married a local woman, and they had many children. Jigger was buried at Nimmitabel Pioneer Cemetery. The Hellenic Club of Canberra laid a commemorative marble plaque over his resting place around 2000. Andonis Manolis' grave is in the old cemetery at Mittagong. The first known free Greek migrant to Australia was Katerina Georgia Plessos (1809–1907), who arrived in Sydney with her husband Major James Crummer in 1835. They married in 1827 on the island of Kalamos where Crummer, the island's commandant met the young refugee from the Greek independence wars. In her old age she must have been one of the last living people to speak to Lord Byron. They lived in Sydney, Newcastle and Port Macquarie. They had 11 children. The first wave of free Hellenic migrants commenced in the 1850s, and continued through the end of the 19th century, prompted in part by the recent discovery of gold in the country. A young Greek immigrant born in Athens, Greece named Georgios Tramountanas (1822 – 29 January 1911) and anglicised as George North in 1858, was the first settler of Greek origin in South Australia in 1842. The Greek community of South Australia regards North (Tramountanas) as their Pioneering Grandfather. In 1901, the year of federation, the Australian census recorded 878 native Greeks that were born there (In Greece), now living in Australia. Many of these Greeks were owners of or were employed in shops and restaurants. Some were also cane-cutters in Queensland.\n\nFrom the last decade of the 19th century until WWI the number of Greeks immigrating to Australia increased steadily and Hellenic communities were reasonably well established in Melbourne and Sydney at this time. The Greek language press had begun in Australia and in 1913, Australia had the first Greek weekly newspaper that was published in Melbourne. During WWI Greece remained neutral, eventually joining the side of the Allies. In 1916 the Australian government responded to this by placing a special prohibition on the entry of Greeks and Maltese people to Australia that was not lifted until 1920. There were a number of anti-Greek outbursts as a result of the neutrality stance by Greece, often instigated by Australian soldiers on leave. During these outbursts Greek shops and Greek cafés were badly damaged or destroyed, with the worst rioting occurring in Kalgoorlie and Boulder.\n\nDuring the 1920s, as a result of the Greco-Turkish War there was a significant amount of Greek migration to Darwin and across the Top End. Greeks often worked in the canefields in North Queensland and move to Darwin during the dry season to work in the pearling industry. One famous family of Greek Australians, the Paspaley family from the island of Kastellorizo, excelled in the Pearling industry and have stores across Australia with their main store being in Darwin. It is noted that the first major flow of Greek immigrants to Australia began in the mid 1920s, where a large number of Greek people from Kastellorizo migrated to Australia to escape the Ottoman repression. A large number of these people from Greece's easternmost island spent time in Egypt's second largest city, Alexandria, before being offered migration to Australia by British authorities. Those of Kastellorizian descent living in Australia now refer to themselves as 'Kazzies,' and have maintained a strong and unique community.\n\nDuring the interwar period, the number of Greeks migrating to Australia increased substantially. Some Greeks who settled in Australia were expelled from Asia Minor after the Greek military defeat and the mass genocide committed by Turkey between 1913 and 1922 while other Greeks sought entry after the USA established restrictive immigration quotas in the early 1920s. From 1924 until 1936 a series of regulations operating in Australia severely restricted the number of Greeks permitted to immigrate to and settle in Australia.\n\nGreece entered WWII with the Allies when she was invaded by German and Italian forces who remained in Greece until 1944. Many ANZACs went to the nation and tried to help the population to defeat the Axis enemy only to be saved themselves by the locals, building a relationship between Australians and Greeks that stands strong to this day. When troops withdrew a struggle broke out between pro and anti-communist factions which resulted in civil war between 1946 and 1949, ending with the defeat of the communists, but at a cost of many Greek lives and the uprooting of children who were kidnapped and taken from their families.\n\nThe Greek government, devastated by the destruction of infrastructure and the mass looting of their banks by the Germans, encouraged post-war migration as a way of solving poverty and unemployment problems. Post WWII in the late 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, Greeks were one of the main European races picked by the Australian government's \"Populate or perish\" immigration scheme and due to this, thousands of Greeks migrated to Australia with just one purpose and that was to gain a better life and future for themselves and their families. The main destinations where these \"Hellenes\" immigrated were to cities such as Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide. During these decades, the Greeks started making an impact in the country like never before, they were not only still establishing their own restaurants, this time they were also establishing their own Hellenic Community Clubs and Greek-Australian Soccer clubs. Greeks along with Italians, Croatians, Maltese, Serbians, Jews, Hungarians, Czechs, etc. really marked a milestone on Australian sport in general by forming some of the greatest and most successful Association football clubs that Australian football has ever had and in the Greek communities case, the most successful Australian clubs with Greek heritage and culture are the inventions of South Melbourne Hellas (South Melbourne FC) founded in 1959, Alexander the Great (Heidelberg United FC) founded in 1958, Pan-Hellenic (Sydney Olympic FC) founded in 1957 and West Adelaide Hellas (West Adelaide SC) founded in 1962. All three clubs were founded by Greek immigrants that immigrated to those respective cities. Since then, the rest of the 20th century from 1970 to 1999, Greek immigration to Australia very much declined and Greek immigrants were very few and not many of them came to settle in Australia during the rest of the century. The main way the Greek population was increasing greatly during this time was through the birth of either full, half or part Australian-born Greek descendants who are children (2nd generation) and grandchildren (3rd generation) of the Greek immigrants who came in the late 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. However, Hellenic/Greek immigration has increased in the last few years due to the severe economic crisis overseas.\n\nAfter the changes in Greece from the mid 1970s, including the fall of the Papadopoulos regime in 1974 and the formal inclusion of Greece into the European Union, Greek immigration to Australia has slowed since the 1971 peak of 160,200 arrivals. Within Australia, the Greek immigrants have been \"extremely well organised socially and politically\", with approximately 600 Greek organisations in the country by 1973, and immigrants have strived to maintain their faith and cultural identity.\n\nBy comparison the Greek Cypriot community in Australia doubled following the Invasion of Cyprus by Turkey following a campaign of ethnic cleansing in 1974.\nSince the year 2000, Greek immigration to Australia has slowed down. However, in the years 2000–2009, many Greek-Australians both native Greek and Australian-born, returned to Greece to discover their homeland and reconnect with their ancestral roots. Yet, as the economic crisis in Greece grew, the opportunities for temporary resident Greek Australians abroad were limited. For this reason many Greek Australians have shortened their planned long term stays in Greece and have returned home to Australia.\n\nIn the early 2010s there has been an increase of Greek immigration flows to Australia due to unemployment, among other issues, because of the economic crisis in Greece. This has led to the return of many Greek Australians which had gone to Greece before the crisis and also the arrival of newcomers from Greece, who have been received by the large Greek Australian community mainly in Melbourne.\n\nThe largest concentration of Greeks in Australia is in the state of Victoria, which is often regarded as the heartland of the Greek Australian community. The latest Census in 2016 recorded 93,740 Greece-born people in Australia, a fall of 6.2 per cent from the 2011 Census. The 2011 distribution by state and territory showed Victoria had the largest number of Greek-born people with 47,236 followed by New South Wales (29,479), South Australia (8,681), Queensland (3,304) and Western Australia (2,308).\n\nWith regards to the total number of people with Greek, Cypriot or Vlach ancestry, either exclusively or in combination with a non-Greek ethnic group, there are 422,234 Greeks according to the 2016 census. 316,351 (74.9%) recorded Greek, Cypriot or Vlach as their first ancestral response, and 105,883 (25.1%) as their second ancestry. Of the 422,234 people with Greek, Cypriot and Vlach ancestry, 42.9% live in Victoria, 33.6% live in New South Wales, 9.56% in South Australia, 7.46% in Queensland, 3.7% in Western Australia, 1.2% in the Australian Capital Territory, 1.01% in the Northern Territory, and 0.59% in Tasmania. Nearly two-thirds (32.8%) of these were born in Australia, and one-third overseas, mostly in Greece and Cyprus. The cities with the largest populations with Greek ancestry are Melbourne with 173,598, Sydney at 127,274, and Adelaide with 37,768 people of Greek descent.\n\nAccording to census data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2016, Australians with Greek ancestry are mainly Christian (90.4%), with smaller religious groups represented. 6.6% identified as spiritual, secular or irreligious, and 2.6% did not answer the census question on religion. Greek Australians are predominantly Greek Orthodox. The largest religious body of Greek Orthodox Australians is the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia, with its headquarters at the Cathedral of The Annunciation of Our Lady in the inner Sydney suburb of Redfern.\n\nIn 2016, the Greek language was spoken at home by 237,588 Australian residents, a 5.8% decrease from the 2011 census data. Greek is the seventh most commonly spoken language in Australia after English, Mandarin, Arabic, Cantonese, Vietnamese and Italian. The remainder of the ethnic Greek population in Australia mainly use English as their first language.\n\nThe Greek language press had begun in Australia in 1913 when the first Greek weekly newspaper was published in Melbourne. In South Australia, the local Greek community published a short-lived newspaper called \"Okeanis\" (Oceania), around 1914 before it moved to Sydney. In 1935 and 1936 a second newspaper, \"Pharos\" (Lighthouse), was published, and a number of short-lived titles were issued in the late 1960s, with the longest of these being \"Tachydromos\" (Mailman), founded in September 1968. Since 1994, a publication called \"Paroikiako Vema\" (Steps in the adopted Country) and printed in Renmark, has served the Greek community in rural South Australia. In 1957, what is today Australia's largest Hellenic/ Greek language newspaper NEOS KOSMOS was founded by Dimitri Gogos, Bill Stefanou and Alekos Doukas, the latter also being an exceptionally well known author.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:Immigration to Australia]]\n[[Category:European Australian]]\n[[Category:Greek minorities|Australia]]\n[[Category:Australian people of Greek descent]]\n[[Category:Greek Australian| ]]"}

His brightly colored paintings, which often feature cartoon-like profiles, are now considered iconic and can still be seen on the East Side Gallery. He currently lives and works in Berlin, Germany.\n\nNoir was born in 1958 in Lyon, France. He moved to Berlin in January 1982 with two small suitcases, attracted by the music of David Bowie and Iggy Pop, who lived in West Berlin at this time. He lived in a squat at Mariannenplatz, near the Berlin Wall.\n\nIn the 1980s, street art was considered vandalism, and German street artists avoided drawing on the wall - it was a kind of taboo for them, Berliners called it a “wall of shame”.\n\nIn April 1984, Noir and Christophe-Emmanuel Bouchet started to paint the Berlin Wall, eventually painting 1 kilometre of it. Initially, the attitude of West Berliners to Noir's work was wary, often even hostile. Some believed that he was working for budget money and were against such spending of money from his taxes. Others believed that Tieri's task was to make a more “presentable” wall, which they could not agree with.\nHe stated of painting the wall at this time: \"I decided spontaneously to start to make something on the wall. I got thousands of questions - everyone wanted to know something about this - because it was new - there were no big paintings on the wall.\" Between 1984 and the fall of the Berlin Wall many other artists painted the wall, including Keith Haring, Kiddy Cidny, and Indiano. Noir can be briefly seen painting part of the Berlin Wall in Wim Wenders's 1987 film \"Wings of Desire.\"\n\nIn 1992 the Berlin Wall was declared a historic monument. In 2009, Noir was part of an initiative by the local government to restore 1300 meters of the wall to address issues caused over the years by vandalism, weather, and theft. As a part of this initiative Noir repainted several of his original works.\n\nIn aid of a child relief organization, well known in Germany, Noir designed a Buddy Bear.

In addition, Noir and local artists, like Shepard Fairey and Kent Twitchell, were commissioned to create new pieces of artwork to display alongside the original pieces of the Berlin Wall.\n\nIn early 2013 Noir painted a large mural with the London-based street artist Stik on the Village Underground Wall in Shoreditch, organized through Street Art London.\n\nLater in 2013 Noir participated in \"Baroque the Streets,\" a collaborative exhibition organized by the Dulwich Picture Gallery and Street Art London. Noir painted a street art mural of Giovanni Battista Tiepolo's baroque masterpiece \"Joseph Receiving Pharaoh's Ring\" (1755) in Dulwich Park.\n\nIn December, 2013 during Art Basel Fair in Miami, Florida, Noir repainted four segments of the Berlin Wall. The segments of the wall together with several other works by Noir are now in the public art collection of Ironside district.\n\nNoir's first solo exhibition was at Howard Griffin Gallery in Shoreditch, London in April 2014.\n\nHoward Griffin showed \"Thierry Noir: The Los Angeles Retrospective\" in Los Angeles from October to November 2014. In conjunction with the LA \"Retrospective,\" Noir painted a 100 metre long commemorative mural on South Spring Street as a gift to the City of Los Angeles in recognition of the near half-century Sister Cities relationship between Berlin and Los Angeles. The mural particularly commemorates the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November. On the same occasion Noir donated a painting to the German Consulate in the United States.\n\nTraces of Noir's work is still visible at the East Side Gallery of the Wall. There is also an example of his work on the portion of the wall in New York City in a courtyard on 53rd street between Madison and 5th Avenue.\n\nNoir's paintings became a symbol of new-found freedom after the reunification of Germany and the end of the Cold War. The Irish rock band U2 featured Noir's artwork on East German Trabant cars and used photos of these to decorate their 1991 album \"Achtung Baby.\" The album itself includes songs, such as \"Zoo Station\", which have themes inspired by the fall of the Wall and the changes taking place in Europe at the end of the Cold War.\n\nThe paintings can also be seen in Wim Wenders' 1987 film \"Wings of Desire\".\n\nIn 2000 Noir was featured in the German documentary \"Nach dem Fall\" (after the fall), in which he discussed his art and the importance of the wall to Berlin only a decade after its fall.\n"}

He is most recognizable to the public for his more than 100 roles in films, television, and stage. Most famously, Hooks, along with Douglas Turner Ward and Gerald S. Krone, founded The Negro Ensemble Company. The Negro Ensemble Company is credited with the launch of the careers of many major black artists of all disciplines, while creating a body of performance literature over the last thirty years, providing the backbone of African-American theatrical classics. Additionally, Hooks is the sole founder of two significant black theatre companies: the D.C. Black Repertory Company, and New York's Group Theatre Workshop. \n\nThe youngest of five children, Hooks was born in Foggy Bottom, Washington, D.C. to Mae Bertha (née Ward), a seamstress, and Edward Hooks who had moved from Rocky Mount, North Carolina with their four other children, Bernice, Caroleigh, Charles Edward \"Charlie\", and James Walter \"Jimmy\". Named Bobby Dean Hooks at birth, Robert was their first child born \"up-north\" and the first to be born in a hospital. His father, Edward, died in a work accident on the railroad in 1939.\n\nHooks attended Stevens Elementary School. In 1945, at the insistence of his sister Bernice who was doing community arts outreach for youngsters at Francis Junior High School, he performed the lead in his first play, The Pirates of Penzance, at the age of nine. From the ages of 6 to 12, Bobby Dean journeyed with his siblings to Lucama, North Carolina to work the tobacco fields for his uncle's sharecropping farm as a way to help earn money for the coming school year in D.C.\n\nIn 1954, just as Brown vs. Board of Education was being implemented in the north, he moved to Philadelphia to be with his mother, her second husband, and his half-sister, Safia Abdullah (née Sharon Dickerson). Hooks experienced his first integrated school experience at West Philadelphia High School. Hooks soon joined the drama club and began acting in plays by William Shakespeare and Samuel Beckett. He was graduated in 1956, passing on a scholarship to Temple University in order to pursue a career as a stage actor at the Bessie V. Hicks School of Theatre (alongside Charles Dierkop and Bruce Dern, with whom he second-acted plays doing their pre-Broadway tryouts in Philadelphia) while working at Browning King, a men's tailor shop at Fourteenth and Chestnut streets.\n\nHaving trained at the Bessie V. Smith School of Theatre in Philadelphia, and after seeing \"A Raisin in the Sun\" in its Philadelphia tryout in February 1959, Hooks moved to New York to pursue acting. In April 1960, as Bobby Dean Hooks, he made his Broadway debut in \"A Raisin in the Sun\" replacing Louis Gossett, Jr. who would be doing the film version. He then continued to do its national tour. He then stepped into the Broadway production of \"A Taste of Honey\", replacing Billy Dee Williams; then repeating the same national tour trajectory as he had done for \"Raisin...\" the previous year. In early 1962 he next appeared as the lead in Jean Genet's \"The Blacks\", replacing James Earl Jones as the male lead, leaving briefly that same year to appear on Broadway again in \"Tiger, Tiger, Burning Bright\" before stepping back into the lead role in \"The Blacks\" in 1963. He then returned to Broadway, first in \"Ballad for Bimshire\" and then in the short-lived 1964 David Merrick revival of \"The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Any More\" (as a character created by Tennessee Williams for this revival) and starring Tallulah Bankhead and Tab Hunter in his only stage performance. Immediately thereafter, in March 24, 1964 he originated the role of Clay in Amiri Baraka's \"Dutchman\". With this play, on the advice of Roscoe Lee Brown, Hooks became known as, Robert Hooks. He also originated roles on the New York stage in \"Where's Daddy?\" for which he won the Theatre World Award and he was nominated for Best Male Lead in a Musical for \"Hallelujah Baby\" while he was simultaneously starring in David Susskind's \"N.Y.P.D.\"—the first African American lead on a television drama.\n\nIn 1968 Hooks was the host of the new public affairs television program, \"Like It Is\".\n\nHooks was nominated for a Tony for his lead role in the musical, \"Hallelujah, Baby!\", has received both the Pioneer Award and the NAACP Image Award for Lifetime Achievement, and has been inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame. He also won an Emmy for his PBS special, \"Voices of Our People\".\n\nSignificant roles for which Hooks is known include Reeve Scott in \"Hurry Sundown\" (1967), Mr. T. in the blaxploitation film \"Trouble Man\" (1972), grandpa Gene Donovan in the comedy \"Seventeen Again\" (2000), and Fleet Admiral Morrow in \"\" (1984). He also appeared on television in an episode of the NBC crime drama series \"The Eddie Capra Mysteries\" in 1978 and portrayed Doctor Walcott in the 1980s television series \"Dynasty\".\n\nIn 1964, as a result of a speaking engagement at the Chelsea Civil Rights Committee (then connected to the Hudson Guild Settlement House) he founded The Group Theatre Workshop, a tuition-free environment for disadvantaged urban teens who expressed a desire to explore acting. Among the instructors were Barbara Ann Teer, Frances Foster, Hal DeWindt, Lonne Elder III, and Ronnie Mack. Alumni include Antonio Fargas, Hattie Winston, and Daphne Maxwell Reid.\n\nThe Group Theatre Workshop was folded into the tuition-free training arm of the he Negro Ensemble Company founded in 1967 with Douglas Turner Ward and Gerald S. Krone with a $1.3 million grant from the Ford Foundation under the auspices of W. McNeil Lowry.\n\nFrom 1969-1972, Hooks served as an original board member of Black Academy of Arts and Letters, located in New York, alongside C. Eric Lincoln, President; John O. Killens, Alvin F. Poussaint, and Charles White. Chartered by the State of New York, its mission was to bring together black artists and scholars from around the world. Additional members included Julian Adderley, Alvin Ailey, Margaret Walker, James Baldwin, Imamu Baraka, Romare Bearden, Harry Belafonte, Lerone Bennett, Arna Bontemps, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee Davis, St. Clair Drake, Ernest Dunbar, Katherine Dunham, Lonne Elder III, Duke Ellington, Alex Haley, Ruth Inge Hardison, Vertis Hayes, Chester Himes, Lena Horne, Jacob Lawrence, Elma Lewis, Henry Lewis, Paule Marshall, Donald McKayle, Arthur Mitchell, Frederick O’Neal, Gordon Parks, Sidney Poitier, Benjamin Quarles, Lloyd Richards, Lucille D. Roberts, and Nina Simone. \n\nIn response to the violence in his home town of Washington, D.C. in the wake of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination, and aided by a small grant from the Eugene and Agnes E. Meyer Foundation, Hooks took a leave of absence from the Negro Ensemble Company to create The D.C. Black Repertory Company (1970-1981). The company was intended as a further exploration of the ability of the arts to create healing. The a capella group Sweet Honey in the Rock was created and developed within its workshop process.\n\nThe Inner Voices (Lorton Prison arts training program, 1971) proved to be a result of the beneficial effect of the repertory company in the D.C. area. In response to a direct plea from an inmate, Rhozier \"Roach\" Brown, who was serving a life sentence in Lorton, Hooks' D.C. Black Repertory Company structured the first prison-based arts program in the United States. While it is the norm now, it was then a revolutionary attempt at rehabilitation through the arts. Eventually The Inner Voices performed more than 500 times in other prisons, including a Christmas special entitled, \"Holidays, Hollowdays.\" Due to Roach's work, President Gerald Ford commuted his sentence on Christmas Day, 1975.\n\nHis relocation to the West Coast redirected Hooks' approach to parity in the arts with his involvement with The Bay Area Multicultural Arts Initiative (1988) as a board member and grant facilitator-judge. Funded by monies from a unique coalition made up of the San Francisco Foundation (a community foundation); Grants for the Arts of the San Francisco Hotel Tax Fund, and The National Endowment for the Arts, the function of this organization was the funding of deserving local multicultural arts organizations.\n\nIn 1992, Hooks co-founded (with writer Lonne Elder III) Arts in Action. Located in South Central Los Angeles, this was a film and television training center established to guide individuals who aspired to careers in film production. It formulated strategies and training for securing entry-level jobs. Courses included: career development workshops; pre-production and production for film and television; creative problem solving in production management; directing for stage and screen—principles and practices; also the craft of assistant directors, script supervisor, technicians, wardrobe, make-up, etc.\n\nThe Negro Ensemble Company of Los Angeles (1994-1997) was created because so many New York members and original members had relocated to the West Coast. Hooks, as founder and executive director Denise Nicholas, Denzel Washington, James Earl Jones, Laurence Fishburne, Richard Roundtree, Samuel L. Jackson, all alumni from New York Negro Ensemble Company to serve as board members. The goal of the Negro Ensemble Company of Los Angeles was to be a new and innovative multi-ethnic cultural project that strived to achieve the community effectiveness and professional success of its parent organization.\n\nHooks is the father of actor, television and film director Kevin Hooks. He married Lorrie Gay Marlow (actress, author, artist) on June 15, 2008. Previously, he was married to Yvonne Hickman and Rosie Lee Hooks.\n\n\n\n\n<nowiki></nowiki> DCN Presents: The Robert Hooks Story\n"}

Unlidded burrows are sometimes quite obvious in crusty, loamy soil. They are difficult to distinguish from related spiders in other families, especially Agelenidae, Desidae and Amphinectidae. Their intra- and interfamilial relationships are contentious. According to the World Spider Catalog, 2019, the family Amaurobiidae includes about 275 species in 49 genera.\n\nIn Australia, they are small to medium-sized entelegyne spiders with minimal sheet webs. They are fairly common in Tasmania and nearby mainland Australia in cooler rainforest, some in caves. They are widespread but uncommon along the eastern coastline. They generally have eight similar eyes in two conservatively curved rows. They often have a calamistrum on metatarsus IV associated with a cribellum. Australian amaurobiids may be distinguished from the Amphinectidae by the absence of a pretarsal fracture and the presence of a retrocoxal hymen on coxa I.\n\nThis family has lost and gained several genera resulting from wide-ranging DNA analysis of spider families. It lost \"Bakala\" and \"Manjala\" to \"Desidae\", while \"Toxopidae\" took in \"Midgee\" and the monotypic genus \"Jamara\". In return, it gained some of Australia's medium-sized brown spiders in the former family \"Amphinectidae\", including \"Tasmabrochus\", \"Tasmarubrius\", and \"Teeatta\"), all of which are common in Tasmania and mainland Australia.\n\n, the World Spider Catalog accepts the following genera:\n\n\n"}

It was released in 1975. It is widely regarded as one of their best albums. \"Rubycon\" further develops the Berlin School sequencer-based sound they ushered in with the title track from \"Phaedra\".\n\nAlthough not quite matching the sales figures for \"Phaedra\", \"Rubycon\" reached number 10 in a 14-week run, their highest-charting album in the UK.\n\nThe album consists of two long tracks, each just over 17 minutes long. \"Rubycon, Part One\", the A-side of the LP, \"ebbs and flows through tense washes of echo and Mellotron choirs, as primitive sequencer lines bubble to the surface”. The B-side, \"Rubycon, Part Two\", \"opens in a wonderfully haunted way\" before \"the synthesizer arpeggios return to drive things along\".\n\nTom Moon includes \"Rubycon\" in his 2008 book \"1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die\", sayng: \"This voyaging vision of sound, ever-unfolding and not quite ever arriving, has been imitated endlessly since 1975. But somehow its admirers haven’t quite captured the openness and faraway grandeur of Tangerine Dream.\"\n\nIn his 1997 book \"Digital Gothic: A Critical Discography of Tangerine Dream\", music journalist Paul Stump praises the album, noting:\n“\"Rubycon\" is simply a refinement of its predecessor—but to an acme of excellence, and demonstrates a mastery of primitive technology breathtaking in its audacity, tenacity and sheer artistic vision. It is probably the best album the band have made…” \n\nAfter the album was released, Christopher Franke's Moog synthesizer was damaged in transit during a tour and Franke himself was nearly killed by an electrical shock.\n\nProduction credits\n\nA single titled \"Extracts From \"Rubycon\"\" was released in March 1975.\n\nBoth tracks of this single were included as part of the compilation \"The Virgin Years 1974–1978\" in 2011.\n"}

Only two athletes, Pamela Jelimo of Kenya, in 2008, and Caster Semenya of South Africa, in 2018, have come within a second of Kratochvílová's mark since it was set.\n\nIn 1983, Kratochvílová broke the 800 m world record with a time of 1:53.28.

If the kigo is a Japanese word, or if there is a Japanese translation in parentheses next to the English kigo, then the kigo can be found in most major Japanese \"saijiki\".\n\n[note: An asterisk (*) after the Japanese name for the kigo denotes an external link to a saijiki entry for the kigo with example haiku that is part of the \"Japanese haiku: a topical dictionary\" website.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe traditional date of Tanabata is 7th day of the 7th month of the Japanese calendar, which falls in early Autumn. The modern use of the Gregorian one has moved the observance to 7 July, which has resulted in a dispute as to whether Tanabata should be treated as a summer kigo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs in many other cultures, the Japanese New Year is an important time of year for celebrations and there are many activities associated with it that may be mentioned in haiku. Before Japan began using the Gregorian calendar in 1873, the Japanese New Year was at the beginning of spring. Many of these terms reflect the traditional calendar system. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirds\n\n\n\n[[Category:Poetic devices]]\n[[Category:Japanese culture-related lists]]\n[[Category:Literature lists]]\n[[Category:Kigo|*]]"}
{"id": "1957924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957924", "title": "C++/CLI", "text": "C++/CLI\n\nC++/CLI (C++ modified for Common Language Infrastructure) is a language specification created by Microsoft which supersedes Managed Extensions for C++. It is a complete revision that simplifies the now-deprecated Managed C++ syntax and provides interoperability with Microsoft .Net languages such as C#. C++/CLI was standardized by Ecma as ECMA-372. It is currently available in Visual Studio 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019 including the Express editions.\n\nC++/CLI is not mentioned in 'The .NET Language Strategy' by Mads Torgersen, posted February 1, 2017.\n\nC++/CLI should be thought of as a language of its own (with a new set of keywords, for example), instead of the C++ superset-oriented Managed C++ (MC++) (whose non-standard keywords were styled like or ). Because of this, there are some major syntactic changes, especially related to the elimination of ambiguous identifiers and the addition of .NET-specific features.\n\nMany conflicting syntaxes, such as the multiple versions of operator in MC++, have been split: in C++/CLI, .NET reference types are created with the new keyword (i.e. garbage collected new()). Also, C++/CLI has introduced the concept of generics from .NET (similar, for the most common purposes, to standard C++ templates, but quite different in their implementation).\n\nIn MC++, there were two different types of pointers: pointers were normal C++ pointers, while pointers worked on .NET reference types. In C++/CLI, however, the only type of pointer is the normal C++ pointer, while the .NET reference types are accessed through a \"handle\", with the new syntax (instead of ). This new construct is especially helpful when managed and standard C++ code is mixed; it clarifies which objects are under .NET automatic garbage collection and which objects the programmer must remember to explicitly destroy.\n\nA tracking reference in C++/CLI is a handle of a passed-by-reference variable. It is similar in concept to using \"\" (reference to a pointer) in standard C++, and (in function declarations) corresponds to the \"\" keyword applied to types in C#, or \"\" in Visual Basic .NET. C++/CLI uses a \"\" syntax to indicate a tracking reference to a handle.\n\nThe following code shows an example of the use of tracking references. Replacing the tracking reference with a regular handle variable would leave the resulting string array with 10 uninitialized string handles, as only copies of the string handles in the array would be set, due to their being passed by value rather than by reference.\n\nint main()\n\nNote that this would be illegal in C#, which does not allow loops to pass values by reference. Hence, a workaround would be required.\n\nAnother change in C++/CLI is the introduction of the finalizer syntax , a special type of nondeterministic destructor that is run as a part of the garbage collection routine. The C++ destructor syntax also exists for managed objects, and better reflects the \"traditional\" C++ semantics of deterministic destruction (that is, destructors that can be called by user code with ).\n\nIn the raw .NET paradigm, the nondeterministic destruction model overrides the protected method of the root class, while the deterministic model is implemented through the interface method (which the C++/CLI compiler turns the destructor into). Objects from C# or VB.NET code that override the Dispose method can be disposed of manually in C++/CLI with just as .NET classes in C++/CLI can.\n// C++/CLI\nref class MyClass\npublic:\nprotected:\n\npublic:\n\n};\nOperator overloading works analogously to standard C++. Every * becomes a ^, every & becomes an %, but the rest of the syntax is unchanged, except for an important addition: for .NET classes, operator overloading is possible not only for classes themselves, but also for references to those classes. This feature is necessary to give a ref class the semantics for operator overloading expected from .NET ref classes. (In reverse, this also means that for .NET framework ref classes, reference operator overloading often is implicitly implemented in C++/CLI.)\n\nFor example, comparing two distinct String references (String^) via the operator == will give true whenever the two strings are equal. The operator overloading is static, however. Thus, casting to Object^ will remove the overloading semantics.\n//effects of reference operator overloading\nString ^s1 = \"abc\";\nString ^s2 = \"ab\" + \"c\";\nObject ^o1 = s1;\nObject ^o2 = s2;\ns1 == s2; // true\no1 == o2; // false\nC++/CLI allows C++ programs to consume C# programs in C# DLLs. Here the #using keyword shows the compiler where the DLL is located for its compilation metadata. This simple example requires no data marshalling.\n\nusing namespace System;\n\nint main(array<System::String ^> ^args) {\n\nThe C# source code content of MyCS.DLL.\n\nnamespace MyCS {\n\nThis examples shows how strings are marshalled from C++ strings to strings callable from C# then back to C++ strings. String marshalling copies the string contents to forms usable in the different environments.\n\nusing namespace System;\n\nint main() {\n\nThe C# code is not in any way C++-aware.\n\nnamespace MyCS {\n\nC++/C# interoperability allows C++ simplified access to the entire world of .Net features.\n\nC++/CX targeting WinRT, although it produces entirely unmanaged code, borrows the ref and ^ syntax for the reference-counted components of WinRT, which are similar to COM \"objects\".\n\n"}

Part of the Florida College System, it is designated a \"state college\" because it offers a greater number of bachelor's degrees than community colleges.\n\nFounded in 1957 as Manatee Junior College, it was known as Manatee Community College from 1985 to 2009. Today, State College of Florida is the region's oldest and largest public college, operating three campuses serving Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Venice. The Bradenton campus is outside the city limits, in the Bayshore Gardens census-designated place.\n\nSCF's official colors are green and blue, and the college's intercollegiate sports teams are known as \"The Manatees\" and are represented by mascot Maverick the Manatee. The name maverick symbolizes the institutions vision to keep evolving.\n\nState College of Florida, Manatee–Sarasota was established on September 17, 1957, by the Florida Board of Education as Manatee Junior College (MJC). The college came into existence under a plan of the State Board of Education to provide accessible higher education to Florida's population.\n\nIn November 1957 \nDr. Samuel R. Neel, Jr became the college's first president and the first classes were held on September 2, 1958, in what was formerly a senior high school; enrollment in the first term was 502 students. The college began administering classes in its own facilities in 1959, where the Bradenton campus stands today. State College of Florida's Bradenton campus is home to The SCF Collegiate School (SCFCS), The Family Heritage House Museum, SCF's Dental Hygiene Clinic, and the athletic facilities for The Manatees. The college's administrative offices are also located on the Bradenton campus.\n\nThe Venice center was opened in 1977 by MJC's Board of Trustees. During this period, the center's functions were funded by the donations of residents living in the surrounding communities which included Venice, North Port, and Englewood. It was not until 1983 that the college received an appropriation from the Florida Legislature to expand the Venice center into a full-service Venice campus. It was dedicated on March 30, 1985, and the college's name was changed that year to Manatee Community College (MCC). The Venice campus lake is nicknamed Lake Jervey and dedicated to Dr. Bill Jervey, Jr for his outstanding contributions to the college.\n\nAt the beginning of 2003, MCC opened the Lakewood Ranch campus. The land appropriated for this was donated by the Schroeder-Manatee Ranch. The Lakewood Ranch campus offers credit and non-credit programs of study, as well as technical and workforce development courses. In 2007, the Schroeder-Manatee Ranch donated an additional to the Lakewood Ranch campus. MCC obtained supplementary funding from the Florida Legislature, which was allocated for the construction of the Medical Technology and Simulation Center.\n\nIn September 2008, MCC began the process of becoming a state college under the direction of then-president Lars A. Hafner, and on March 17, 2009, the State Board of Education unanimously approved the colleges proposal to offer its first baccalaureate degree. In July of that same year, MCC officially changed its name to State College of Florida, Manatee–Sarasota (SCF) to reflect its new status as a four-year state institution. The first bachelor's degree to be offered at the college was a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.) which started in January 2010. State College of Florida continues to add baccalaureate degree programs to its offerings based on a combination of regional, state, and national need. Several other bachelor degree programs are now offered at SCF.\n\nStudents can attend classes on campuses located in Bradenton, Venice, and Lakewood Ranch. Students can also visit many business and public-sector sites throughout the community as well as attend online classes.\n\nState College of Florida has been awarded The Association of Florida College's Campus Sustainability Award. And In 2011, the college was awarded The U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Efficient Design (LEED) Gold certification for the construction of the Medical Technology & Simulation Center on its Lakewood Ranch campus. Maintaining sustainability remains a continuous effort at SCF by integrating environmental, social and economic goals through design, planning and operational organization to meet its current needs.\nAs a member of the Florida College System, State College of Florida falls under the purview of the State Board of Education. SCF is governed by the Florida Legislature and by a District Board of Trustees, consisting of eight members appointed by the Governor to oversee the college's operations.\n\nThe college's president is Dr. Carol F. Probstfeld, who was inaugurated as the sixth president of the State College of Florida on November 8, 2013, after serving as the college's vice president of business and administrative services. Before coming to SCF, Probstfeld served as the vice president for finance and administration and the chief financial officer and treasurer for Notre Dame de Namur University in Belmont, California, and Notre Dame College of Ohio in South Euclid, Ohio.\n\nProbstfeld has been committed to building and nurturing relationships and focusing on enhancing the student experience. Under her leadership, the State College of Florida Foundation launched its first Capital Campaign in 2016 to provide facilities that enhance the student experience. The campaign financed $1 million in technological upgrades for the new Library and Learning Center that opened in February 2018 and includes a $3.5 million Studio for the Performing Arts and a $9.5 million Health and Human Performance Center. Both of which will be built on the Bradenton campus.\n\nDr. Probstfeld has also led the college's efforts to boldly engage its students, faculty, staff, and community partners to achieve the goals of the college's 2015-2020 \"Boldly Engaging\" strategic plan. In the plan's first three years, SCF has purchased of land for a new Parrish campus, added signature programs to its Venice campus, enacted multiple strategic enrollment initiatives, created a Leadership Development program to mentor its employees, and launched a comprehensive communications and marketing plan.\nState College of Florida is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award associate and baccalaureate degrees. Noncredit education is offered under SCF's Corporate & Community Development programs. More than 50 percent of the college-bound high school students in Manatee and Sarasota counties attend SCF each year, with a current enrollment of over 11,000 students. State College of Florida is among the top 100 producers of associate degrees in the United States.\n\nState College of Florida is also a charter member of the Manufacturing Institute's \"M-list,\" which recognizes schools for excellence in manufacturing education. The Manufacturing Institute is an organization that is dedicated to improving and expanding manufacturing in the United States. SCF was one of eleven Florida College System institutions to be selected, helping Florida lead the nation with the most schools on the list.\n\nState College of Florida's nursing program annually records one of the highest certification rates in the state of Florida, and the physical therapy assistant, occupational therapy assistant, dental hygiene and radiography programs have a 98% percent licensure pass rate.\n\nSCF's study abroad program allows students the unique opportunity to travel to places outside of the United States. Students can visit places such as London, Oxford, Paris, Amsterdam and more. The program takes place during the summer months.\n\nState College of Florida has three campus libraries including a large online collection. These locations include Bradenton, Venice, and Lakewood Ranch. The collections include print and electronic books, academic journals, magazines and newspapers, thousands of online research databases, audio books, streaming videos, DVDs, citation tools, music, and periodicals. Group study rooms, computer labs, and wireless printing services are also available. In addition to the on site librarians, students can use digital reference services such as AskALibrarian, where they can chat, email or text with an SCF librarian.\n\nA new $17.6 million library facility opened in 2018. The facility includes a visualization studio which has a visual capability of 270 degrees, a 200-seat community room, 3D printers, and a film studio with multiple editing suites. As well as a section of the library in which students may not bring mobile telephones and laptop computers.\n\nSCF is one of the 25 colleges and universities in the United States to participate in Yale University's Small World Initiative, a project that engages students in real-world research by searching for and identifying antibiotic-producing bacteria in soil and other environments. SCF has also partnered with Tufts University to test the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in the environment. Other undergraduate research opportunities are offered to SCF students under the Tampa Bay Bridge to Baccalaureate program (B2B). The Tampa Bay Bridge to Baccalaureate program is a collaboration between The State College of Florida, Hillsborough Community College, and St. Petersburg College. It is funded by the National Science Foundation under its Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Program. The purpose of the B2B program is to increase the number of underrepresented minority students completing a bachelor's degree in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM). Under the program, students have the opportunity to participate in research and internships through the college, local businesses, and through other universities.\n\nSCF's Venice campus is home to the Gator Engineering program, a collaboration with the University of Florida. Students can take their math and science courses at SCF and upon successful completion will be granted admission to UF's Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering.\n\nState College of Florida also participates in the FUSE Transfer Program, a partnership with the University of South Florida. The FUSE Program provides a seamless transition from SCF to the USF System. The program also allows for timely completion of both the Associate of Arts (A.A.) and bachelor's degrees.\n\nPreviously the college held dual enrollment classes on the campuses of high schools operated by the School District of Manatee County and Sarasota County Public Schools. In 2018 the college announced that it would only offer dual enrollment classes held on its own campuses or those accessed on the internet.\n\nCollectively, State College of Florida's three campuses have over 50 registered student organizations, including an active Student Government, intramural sports, and a campus ministry. Students can participate in clubs such as Phi Theta Kappa, Model UN, Circle K International, and more. The college encourages the participation and creation of student organizations that have an impact on the community and foster a sense of school spirit and pride.\n\nThe Bradenton and Venice campuses each have their own independent Student Government Associations. State College of Florida's SGA is divided into three parts consisting of the Executive Board, the General Council, and the Inter-Club Council. The Executive Board is composed of the Student Body President, Student Body Vice President, Secretary/Treasurer, Inter-Club Council (ICC) President, and the Chief Justice. The Inter-Club Council (ICC) is composed of representatives from each registered club on campus, while the General Council is made up of members of the student body. Executive Board elections are held during the spring semester, but General Council members can join as late as the beginning of the fall semester. Members of the SGA Executive Board also serve on the Student Activities Budget Review Committee (SABR) which manages and allocates funds to SCF'S 50+ clubs and organizations. General Council members can serve on the Campus Activities Board (CAB) which is responsible for planning and organizing campus activities throughout the semester such as the annual spring and fall festivals.\n\nThe Brain Bowl team at the State College of Florida has achieved state and national recognition for being one of the top quiz bowl programs in the country. In the 2014-2015 competition season, SCF's \"Fire Team\" compiled a record of 58-2 against other two-year schools, going on to win championships at tournaments such as the 2014 Delta Burke Invitational, 2015 FCSAA West Central Regional, 2015 FCSAA Brain Bowl State Championship, 2015 NAQT South Florida Community College Sectionals, and the 2015 NAQT Community College Championship Tournament. The team was also invited to compete in NAQT's Intercollegiate Championship Tournament (DII) where the team placed 25th with a record of 7-6, notably defeating four-year schools such as UC Berkeley, Duke University, University of Alabama, and Claremont Colleges in the process.\n\nState College of Florida's music program is home to eleven different musical ensembles. They include The Bradenton Symphony Orchestra, Symphonic band, Chamber choir, Concert choir, Big band, Jazz combo, Guitar ensemble, Keyboard studies, Presidential string quartet, Presidential jazz combo, and the Musical Theatre Ensemble. State College of Florida's music students perform in multiple concerts throughout the semester as well as numerous community and state events such as the FCSAA Winter Music Symposium. Auditions are open to students and the general public.\n\nStudio 84 Productions, the student theatre and musical theatre company at the State College of Florida does a total of four to five productions per year. Auditions are open to students and to the community. Most theatre graduates have gone on to four-year universities to receive their Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) or Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degrees in Theater and Performing Arts. SCF Theater alumni include American actor Dallas Roberts (\"The walking Dead\"), various Broadway performers, and many more.\n\nState College of Florida's Bradenton campus includes a weight room, sand volleyball court, outdoor basketball court, and a reflection pond. Most of the athletic fields, such as the gymnasium and the tennis courts are open to students when not in use. The Venice campus includes a fit trail and nature trail that surrounds the campus lake and includes 10 stations for balanced exercise routines. The \"State College of Florida Foundation\" is currently in the process of raising funds for a brand-new Health and Human Performance Center that will be built on the college's Bradenton campus. The facility will feature a full-size fitness center, training facilities, a state-of-the-art gymnasium, team rooms for The Manatees and for away teams, classrooms, offices, and concession and vending areas.\n\nState College of Florida launched its intercollegiate athletics program in 1957 and adopted \"The Lancers\" as their mascot. When MCC decided to change its name to SCF in 2009, the college adopted a new mascot, as well as changing the college's official colors from blue and yellow, to blue and green.\n\nToday, State College of Florida's athletic teams are known as \"The Manatees\" and are represented by mascot Maverick the Manatee. State College of Florida host five intercollegiate sports teams. They include: Men's basketball, Men's baseball, Women's Softball, Women's tennis, and Women's volleyball. They compete in the Suncoast Conference (SCC) of the Florida College System Activities Association (FCSAA) in Division I of the NJCAA Region VIII. The State College of Florida Manatees have won numerous regional, state and conference titles and have made several national championship appearances.\n\nAthletics alumni include MLB players Nick Goody, Josh Lucas, and Reggie McClain.\n\nThe Bradenton campus is home to The Family Heritage House Museum, a gallery and research center for the study of African American history and achievements housed in the College's Library and Learning Center.

Young\n\nEmily Hilda Daniell (21 March 1880 – 8 August 1949) was an English novelist, children's writer and mountaineer. She wrote under the pseudonym E. H. Young. She was also a supporter of the women's suffrage movement.\n\nE. H. Young was a strong-selling novelist, born in Whitley, Northumberland, to Frances Jane Young and William Michael Young, a shipbroker. She was the sister of actress Gladys Young. Young attended Gateshead Secondary School and later Penrhos College, Colwyn Bay. In 1902, at the age of 22, she married John Arthur Helton Daniell, a Bristol solicitor, and moved with him to the fashionable Bristol neighbourhood of Clifton.\n\nHere Young developed an interest in classical and modern philosophy. She became a supporter of the women's suffrage movement, and started writing novels. She also began a lifelong affair with Ralph Henderson, a schoolteacher and friend of her husband.\n\nWhen the First World War broke out in 1914, Young went to work, first as a stable groom and then in a munitions factory. Her husband, who served as a sergeant in the Royal Garrison Artillery, was killed on 1 July 1917, during preparations for the Third Battle of Ypres. The following year she moved to 87a Sydenham Hill, London to join her lover, now the headmaster of Alleyn's public school, and his wife in a ménage à trois. Young became the librarian at the school, and occupied a separate flat in the Hendersons' house. She was addressed as \"Mrs Daniell\" to conceal their unconventional arrangement.\n\nThis change seems to have been the catalyst she needed. Seven novels followed, all set in Clifton, thinly disguised as \"Upper Radstowe\". The first was \"The Misses Mallett\", published originally as \"The Bridge Dividing\" in 1922. Her 1930 novel \"Miss Mole\" won the James Tait Black Award for fiction. In the 1940s, Young also wrote books for children: \"Caravan Island\" (1940) and \"River Holiday\" (1942).\n\nAfter Henderson's retirement and the death of his wife, Young moved with him to Bradford on Avon in Wiltshire. They never married. During the Second World War, she worked actively in air-raid precautions. She continued to live in Wiltshire with Henderson until her death from lung cancer in 1949.\n\nYoung and Henderson also shared a love of mountaineering, for which she and her sister Gladys had developed an enthusiasm in adolescence. In 1911 Young became an early member of the Fell & Rock Climbing Club, though it was in Snowdonia that she climbed most frequently.\n\nOn 14 August 1915, she led Henderson, Ivor Richards and James Roxborough on a pioneering route up the Idwal Slabs. Previously thought to be impregnable by experienced climbers such as O. G. Jones, Henderson later testified to her, \"remarkable qualities of balance, speed, and leadership, and to her sound judgment of rock and route.\" Originally christened \"Minerva\", in honour of feminine endeavour, the route is now better known as \"Hope\".\n\nYoung was a founder member of the Pinnacle Club formed in 1921. However, she climbed less frequently as her literary career flourished.\n\nThough popular in its time, Young's work is little read today. In 1980, a four-part series based on her novels – mainly \"Miss Mole\" – was shown on BBC television as \"Hannah\". The feminist publishing house Virago reprinted several of her books in the 1980s. The Clifton and Hotwells Improvement Society has marked her Clifton home with a plaque.\n\nThe E. H. Young Prize for Greek Thought was an annual essay prize awarded in her memory at Bristol Grammar School.\n\nFiction:\n\nChildren's fiction:\n\n\n"}

Moxy was founded by the industrialist Birger Hatlebakk, who had previously founded the Glamox factory in Molde.\n\nMoxy built the first prototype dump truck in 1970. The first model was a heavy duty dump truck drawn by a powerful tractor with rear wheels driven by hydraulic motors. The next version, an articulated dump truck driven by a Scania diesel engine, D20, was also finished in 1970. The first prototypes were built in Molde, but then the company moved to Varhol by Elnesvågen in Fræna municipality, where a new factory was built. About the same time Moxy acquired Gjøvik based company Øveraasen Motorfabrikk & Mekaniske Verksted, which provided Moxy with useful engineering technology.\n\nIn 1972 Moxy marketed its first articulated dump truck, the Viking D15, which used a bogie under the dump box and six wheel drive. The trucks were well received by the earth moving industry. Around 1980 the company was acquired by English company Brown Engineering, who changed the name to Moxy Industries AS.\n\nDuring the 80's several new dump trucks were developed and Moxy gained a good reputation in the market place and exported their products to several countries around the globe. In order to increase their production capacity Moxy cooperated with Tallmek Smøla AS, who produced the dump boxes. In the 80's Moxy started a cooperation with the Japanese company Komatsu. During one period Moxy produced dump trucks that Komatsu sold under their own brand name. In 1991 the Norwegian state owned company AS Olivin and Komatsu together acquired Moxy and changed the company name to Moxy Trucks AS. Olivin owned 2/3 and Komatsu 1/3 of the shares. The new owners injected fresh capital and the Moxy dump trucks were sold through the Komatsu sales network, which led to a large increase in sales.\n\nIn 2000 Komatsu withdrew from the partnership and Moxy lost a number of its sales outlets, which led to a reduction in sales. The drop in sales in turn led to a reduction in the workforce, this coincided with the Norwegian state's efforts to partly privatise Olivin (49% of the shares were sold to private investors). In order to make Olivin more attractive for prospective byers the state injected 50 mil NOK into the company and split off the struggling Moxy as a state owned company. However, in 2002 51% of the shares in Moxy were sold to the Ålesund based company Spilka Invest AS. A few months later the Norwegian economy started to improve and the sales of Moxy dump trucks increased.\n\nDespite the economic problems the Moxy dump truck has a good reputation in the earth moving industry and the English Thomson group acquired the company's assets, production continued under the new company Moxy Engineering AS. In 2008, Doosan Infracore's Construction Equipment Business Group acquired 100% of the company from Thomson Group, and changed the name as Doosan Moxy AS. In 2011, the Moxy name was dropped and latest trucks were marketed under just the Doosan brand, rather than the previous Doosan-Moxy marque.\n\nThe trucks are designed to work in rough terrain in all operating conditions and are built with highly advanced drive train and chassis design, which gives the Moxy dump trucks very good traction and stability.\n\n\n"}

Van Horne went on to manage Kendo the Samurai (a masked samurai gimmick played at different points by Tim Horner, Scott Antol and Brian Logan, among others) for a brief time before disappearing from the promotion.\n\nMitchell was fired by Jim Cornette after hearing that Smokey Mountain Wrestling was going out of business due to a family problem with Cornette; Mitchell said he dialed all the production crew when he was drunk dialing and eventually was yelled at on the phone by Cornette.\n\nMitchell debuted in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as James Vandenberg, the manager of Mortis, a masked wrestler billed as a shoot fighter from Taipei who was one of Vandenberg's \"rare oddities\". Mortis feuded with Glacier in an angle titled \"Blood Runs Cold,\" and faced him at Uncensored on March 16, 1997 in his pay-per-view debut, which he lost. Following the match, Wrath debuted, siding with Mortis and Vandenberg and attacking Glacier. Glacier defeated Mortis in a rematch at Slamboree on May 18, when Wrath interfered on Mortis's behalf, causing a disqualification; Glacier then suffered another post-match beating before Ernest \"The Cat\" Miller ran to the ring to defend him. The four men fought one another over the following weeks, culminating in a match at Bash at the Beach on July 13, which was won by Mortis and Wrath. After Blood Runs Cold officially ended, Vandenberg continued to manage the pair through the remainder of 1997 as Mortis and Wrath entered a feud with The Faces of Fear that culminated in a pinfall victory at Fall Brawl. In early 1998, the group was split up after Wrath was sidelined with an injury and Mortis was moved into a new angle involving Raven and the Flock.\n\nMitchell then tried to get a commentary segment off the ground on \"WCW Saturday Night\", titled \"Vandenberg's Odditorium.\" He appeared on camera standing alone in a dimly-lit space, discussing current feuds such as that between Saturn and Glacier, always finishing the segment with \"And I \"could\" be wrong...but I doubt it.\" The segment was quietly axed after a few weeks. Mitchell was then sent home and was paid for two years until his contract ran out.\n\nIn 2000, he debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) as an unnamed evil priest character. He was originally planned to manage Mike Awesome but instead began an angle with Raven. The angle was dropped when Raven went to the WWF, and Mitchell was subsequently rebranded as The Sinister Minister, a heel narrator for ECW on TNN, much like the Crypt Keeper in Tales from the Crypt. Upon debuting as a manager, he was surprisingly accepted as a fan favorite by the crowd. He managed The Unholy Alliance (Yoshihiro Tajiri and Mikey Whipwreck) during their feud with The Full Blooded Italians. On November 5, 2000, he was injured in an accident with a handheld machine that was used for shooting fireballs, which exploded and blew off a piece of his finger.\n\nMitchell debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on June 19, 2002. On October 30, going by the name Father James Mitchell, he returned to TNA along with Slash and Brian Lee, collectively known as the Disciples of The New Church. The New Church feuded with America's Most Wanted throughout 2002.\n\nIn 2003, The New Church began feuding with Raven. On November 5, 2003, Mitchell fought Raven in a last man standing match that was won by Raven. In late 2003, Mitchell aligned himself with The Gathering, Raven's former protégés.\n\nMitchell returned to TNA on July 1, 2005, aligning himself with Abyss. Mitchell led Abyss to victories over Lance Hoyt at Sacrifice and Sabu at Genesis. At Turning Point on December 11, Abyss lost to Sabu in a barbed wire match.\n\nAt Genesis in 2006, Abyss won his first NWA World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Sting. The weeks after Abyss's title reign Sting seemed to control Abyss, and he ordered Abyss to come to the ring alone where he would speak to Abyss without Mitchell speaking in Abyss's ear. Mitchell nearly lost control of Abyss, however soon scared him straight by showing Abyss a prison. Mitchell slammed Abyss into the fence and slapped him and reminded Abyss about his past. This act let Mitchell once again control Abyss with both men going into Final Resolution as a unit, manager and wrestler, to help Abyss defend his title against Sting and Christian Cage. On January 14, 2007, at Final Resolution Abyss lost his World Heavyweight Championship to Christian Cage during a Three Way Elimination match against Sting and Christian Cage. Abyss was eliminated by Sting after a Scorpion Death Drop, and then Sting by Christian Cage. The following week, Mitchell was later attacked and kidnapped by Sting, who threw him into the trunk of his car, and told Mitchell to leave Abyss alone. On January 25, he was able to give Sting by payback by launching a fireball right into Sting's face. The week after that, he told Abyss to find Sting while he later came into the ring and told Sting if he would accept his challenge at Against All Odds pay-per-view and on February 8, he accepted. He was then \"kidnapped\" by Sting again only this time, he was locked up in a cage, until Abyss came to his rescue by attacking Sting while Mitchell grab his belt buckle and choked Sting with it. At Against All Odds on February 11, Abyss lost to Sting in a prison yard match after he was powerbombed by Sting into a barbed wired table.\n\nSubsequently, Mitchell was attacked by Sting after the match, causing him to bleed heavily. Mitchell returned to on screen action on March 22 when he came up the ramp and distracted Abyss away from his tag team match by bringing Abyss' on-screen mother to ringside. It was then revealed at a meeting with Sting and Mitchell that Abyss' mother had actually shot his dad, and Abyss took the blame to protect his mother. Mitchell was once again Abyss' handler, as \"Father Jim\" had threatened to report Abyss' mother to the authorities if Abyss did not come back to him, after which Mitchell allied Abyss with Team Cage.\n\nOn the April 19 edition of \"Impact!\", after months of abuse by Mitchell, Abyss turned on Mitchell, Black Hole Slamming him, and turning face. Later, Mitchell delivered a eulogy for Abyss, saying that he had moved on to bigger and better things, and implying that he had a new monster. This monster was eventually revealed as his \"son\" Judas Mesias, who first appeared as a hand cutting a hole in the ring and pulling Abyss through it. He made his official debut on the September 13 \"Impact!\", assaulting Abyss. On the January 17 edition of \"Impact!\", Mitchell finally revealed the secret that he had been threatening to reveal for months: that Abyss was his on-screen son. After a six-month inactivity, TNA announced that Mitchell was released from his TNA contract on July 7, 2008.\n\nOn July 5, 2013, Mitchell made a one night appearance at TNA One Night Only Hardcore Justice, accompanying Judas Mesias, who faced his storyline half brother and full brother of Abyss, Joseph Park in a monsters ball match, which Park won.\n\nMitchell appeared at the World Wrestling Entertainment-produced ECW reunion pay-per-view ECW One Night Stand on June 12, 2005. He & Whipwreck accompanied Tajiri to ringside for his match with Super Crazy and Little Guido.\n\nHe was due to continue managing wrestlers and working with the WWE's version of Extreme Championship Wrestling after its re-launch, however, a contract between Mitchell and WWE was never signed, and he ceased making any further appearances on ECW.\n\nIn June 2009, Mitchell was going to try out for WWE's developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling but was told that he needed to pay $1,000 to try out and that manager tryouts had already occurred in January 2009.\n\nMitchell made his return to TNA, now Impact Wrestling, at Slammiversary XV where he was seen giving Joseph Park his Abyss mask. Upon donning the mask, Park transformed into Abyss, allowing him and Jeremy Borash to defeat Josh Mathews and Scott Steiner. After this, Mitchell would make sporadic appearances, aiding his storyline son, including summoning Abyss in March 2018 for a Monster's Ball match against Kongo Kong. Mitchell would then make recurring appearances during Rosemary's storyline feud with Su Yung over the soul of Allie, first appearing as the keeper of Rosemary's soul, which would then be followed by further appearances in February 2019, managing Su Yung, Allie and an undead bride against a team lead by Rosemary.. During the September 2019 tapings, Mitchell was briefly seen taking the onscreen wedding of Brian Cage & Melissa Santos, held in a radically shortened format which included only the vows and exchanging of rings.\n\nWhile working for TNA, Mitchell also sang at approximately ten shows a week at resorts in Florida. His act consisted of songs by Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, in addition to songs akin to The Blues Brothers and The Memphis Horns. He also hosted open karaoke events at the resorts, on a weekly basis.\n\nMitchell appears on the Insane Clown Posse song \"Ride the Tempest\", from their album \"The Tempest\". He performs a carnival barker-style introduction to the song, featuring the signature laughter of his Sinister Minister gimmick.\n"}

Yukon Daylight Time (YDT) when observed was eight hours behind UTC. In 1983 the based time zone was restructured and renamed the Alaska Time Zone.\n\nWhen it was created, the Yukon Time Zone included Yukon, and a small region around Yakutat, Alaska (Alaska had been spread across four different time zones at the time).\n\nYukon, which had adopted Yukon Standard Time in 1900, observed a one-hour advance in 1918 and 1919, and again year-round from February 1942 to September 1945. In 1965, from the last Sunday in April to the last Sunday in September, double daylight time - a two-hour advance - was observed. On July 1, 1966, most of the Yukon switched to Pacific Standard Time (PST), which is , leaving Dawson City and Old Crow on Yukon time. The remaining area changed to Pacific Time on October 28, 1973, leaving only Yakutat on the Yukon Time Zone.\n\nOn October 30, 1983, coincident with the end of daylight saving time, Alaska switched in 1983 from four time zones to two time zones. The areas east of Yakutat set clocks back two hours to change from Pacific Daylight Time to what had been Yukon Standard Time, , and the time zone was named Alaska Standard Time at the end of November. Yakutat only set clocks back one hour on that date. Most of the remaining longitudes of Alaska left their clocks unchanged on that date, changing from Alaska-Hawaii Daylight Time () to the new Alaska Standard Time (). Some areas that had been on Bering Time ( in winter, in summer) such as Nome set their clocks ahead yet another hour on October 30, 1983 to adopt Alaska Standard Time (the former Yukon Standard Time), effectively changing their standard time zone by two hours. Most of the Aleutian Islands moved from the Bering Time Zone () to the Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time Zone () (until 1983 known as the Alaska-Hawaii Standard Time Zone).\n\n"}

Their work, while extremely comedic, is often highly politically charged. Their name is a play of words on \"Kinsey 6\", the end of the Kinsey scale defined as exclusively homosexual.\n\nThe Kinsey Sicks began in 1993 when a group of five friends (largely lawyers and professional activists) went to a Bette Midler concert in San Francisco, dressed as the Andrews Sisters. Assuming they would be among many drag queens, they found themselves to be the only ones. They were approached that night by a woman who asked them to perform at her upcoming 50th birthday party. Though their initial reply was, \"we don't sing,\" the group was surprised to learn that all of them had previous musical experience.\n\nIn July 1994, The Kinsey Sicks (then consisting of Ben Schatz as \"Rachel\", Irwin Keller as \"Winnie\", Maurice Kelly as \"Trixie\", Jerry Friedman as \"Vaselina\", and Abatto Avilez as \"Begoña\") drew a large and enthusiastic crowd at their first public performance on a street corner in San Francisco's Castro District. A year later, Avilez died, and was never replaced, leaving the Kinsey Sicks as a quartet (a formation that has remained consistent ever since.) Since then, The Kinsey Sicks have produced and performed full-length theatrical productions and concerts around the country. The group eventually became successful enough for its members to leave their former occupations to concentrate on performance.\n\nSince its initial formation, the lineup of the Kinsey Sicks has undergone several changes and iterations. Schatz has been the group's only constant through all incarnations. Each member of the group performs a fully realized character, and as new members have joined, they have been encouraged to personally expand and develop their own \"history\". The members of the group over the years have been:\n\nCurrent members\n\nFormer members\n\n\n\nIn 2001 the Kinsey Sicks produced and starred off-Broadway in the critically acclaimed \"DRAGAPELLA!

That production received a nomination for a Lucille Lortel award for Best Musical of 2001 and a Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Lyrics for lyricist Ben Schatz.\n\nIn 2006 the Kinsey Sicks performed an extended engagement at the Las Vegas Hilton. In addition, their first feature film, \"Kinsey Sicks: I Wanna Be a Republican,\" premiered at the 30th San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. The documentary \"The Kinsey Sicks: Almost Infamous,\" covering the history of the group and their run at the Las Vegas Hilton was released in 2008.\n\nThe group has also appeared in such venues as the Herbst Theatre and New Conservatory Theatre Center, San Francisco; Boston Center for the Arts and The Theater Offensive, Boston; Just for Laughs Comedy Festival and Club Soda, Montreal; the Nordstrom Recital Hall and Triple Door Seattle; the Ogden Theatre, Denver; the Colony Theatre, South Beach; the Wheeler Opera Hall, Aspen; Studio 54, Caroline's on Broadway, and Gotham Comedy Club, New York City; Hobby Center for the Performing Arts and The Improv, Houston; Crown & Anchor and Town Hall, The Palm, Blue Chairs, and Club Manana, Provincetown.

{"id": "1957964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957964", "title": "The Queen's Beasts", "text": "The Queen's Beasts\n\nThe Queen's Beasts are ten heraldic statues representing the genealogy of Queen Elizabeth II, depicted as the Royal supporters of England. They stood in front of the temporary western annexe to Westminster Abbey for the Queen's coronation in 1953. Each of The Queen's Beasts consists of an heraldic beast supporting a shield bearing a badge or arms of a family associated with the ancestry of Queen Elizabeth II. They were commissioned by the British Ministry of Works from sculptor James Woodford (who was paid the sum of £2,750 for the work). They were uncoloured except for their shields at the coronation.\n\nThey are now on display in the Canadian Museum of History.\n\nThere are other statues of the Queen's Beasts, sometimes referred to as the King's Beasts, at Hampton Court Palace and Kew Gardens in London, and on the roof of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.\n\nThere are ten heraldic beasts of a very like sort at Hampton Court Palace near London. They were restored at the beginning of the twentieth century but were derived from originals made more than 400 years ago for Henry VIII, and are generally called 'the King's Beasts'. They are carved in stone and each sits erect, supporting a shield upon which there is a coat of arms or a heraldic badge. From the beasts themselves and the emblems which they carry on their shields it is evident that they stood for King Henry and his third Queen, Jane Seymour.\n\nIn the autumn of 1952, the Minister of Works, in preparation for the great event some months ahead, called upon the Royal Academician and sculptor James Woodford, OBE, to create ten new beasts similar in form and character to the ten at Hampton Court but more particularly, appropriate to the Queen. Exact replicas of those at Hampton Court would have been unsuitable for the occasion, for some of them would have little connection with Her Majesty's own family or ancestry.\n\nThe beasts are some six feet (1.8 m) high and weigh about 700 pounds (320 kg) each. They are works in plaster, and so cannot be left exposed to the elements. Originally uncolored except for their shields, they are now fully painted.\n\nThe Beasts were on display outside the western annexe of Westminster Abbey. The annexe was a glass-fronted construction in which to marshal the long processions before the service. The statues were placed along the front with the exception of The Lion of England. It was placed in the alcove formed by the North wall of the annex and the entrance used by the Queen to enter the Abbey on her arrival in the Gold State Coach. The statues were placed left to right in the following order when facing the annex from the west: The Lion of England, the greyhound, the yale, the dragon, the horse, the lion of Mortimer, the unicorn, the griffin, the bull, and the falcon. This was not the same order as they are in the royal pedigree, but were ordered in this way for balance and symmetry in display. The Scottish Unicorn, Horse of Hanover, Griffin and Falcon replace four of the Beasts at Hampton Court (Seymour Black Lion, Seymour colour-spotted Panther & Seymour Unicorn & either the so-called Tudor Dragon or the Royal Dragon).\n\nAfter the coronation, they were removed to the Great Hall in Hampton Court Palace. In 1957, they were moved again to St George's Hall, Windsor. The beasts were taken into storage in April 1958 while their future was considered. It was eventually decided to offer them to the Commonwealth governments; Canada, being the senior nation, was offered them first. In June 1959, the Canadian government accepted the beasts and they were shipped there in July. Originally, the only coloured parts of the statues were their heraldic shields; but, for the celebrations of the Centennial of Canadian Confederation in 1967, the statues were painted in their full heraldic colours. They are now in the care of the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau.\n\nIn 1958, Sir Henry Ross, Chairman of the Distillers Company in Edinburgh, paid for Portland stone replicas of the statues, which are on display outside the Palm House at Kew Gardens. The beasts also served as models for topiary at Hall Place, Bexley. The original sculptures have been commemorated in the following forms: bone china figurines, cups and saucers, glass tray sets, plaster models, reclaimed material reproductions, porcelain candlesticks, British postage stamps issued in 1998, silver tea spoons, and tea towels. In 2016 the Royal Mint launched a series of ten Queen's Beasts coins, one for each beast.\n\nThe Lion of England is the crowned golden lion of England, which has been one of the supporters of the Royal Arms since the reign of Edward IV (1461–1483). It supports a shield showing the as they have been since Queen Victoria's accession in 1837. In the first and last quarters of the shield are the lions of England, taken from the arms of Richard I \"The Lionheart\" (1157–1199). The lion and tressure (armorial border) of Scotland appear in the second, and the harp of Ireland is in the third.\n\nThe White Greyhound of Richmond was a badge of John of Gaunt, Earl of Richmond, son of Edward III. It was also used by Henry IV and especially by Henry VII. The Tudor double rose can be seen on the shield, one rose within another surmounted by a crown. It symbolizes the union of two of the cadet houses of the Plantagenet - York and Lancaster.\n\nThe Yale was a mythical beast, supposedly white and covered with gold spots and able to swivel each of its horns independently. It descends to the Queen through Henry VII, who inherited it from his mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort. The shield shows a portcullis surmounted by a royal crown. The portcullis (uncrowned) was a Beaufort badge, but was used both crowned and uncrowned by Henry VII.\n\nThe red dragon was a badge used by Owen Tudor, after the story of the dragon on Llewelyn the Last's castle grounds. His grandson, Henry VII, took it as a token of his supposed descent from Cadwaladr, the last of the line of Maelgwn. The beast holds a shield bearing a lion in each quarter; this was the coat of arms of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the last native Prince of Wales.\n\nThe White Horse of Hanover was introduced into the Royal Arms in 1714 when the crown of Great Britain passed to the Elector George of Hanover. This grandson of Elizabeth Stuart, sister of Charles I, became George I, King of Britain, France and Ireland. The shield shows the leopards of England and the lion of Scotland in the first quarter, the fleur-de-lis of France in the second and the Irish harp in the third quarter. The fourth quarter shows the Arms of Hanover.\n\nThe White Lion of Mortimer descends to the Queen through Edward IV. The shield shows a white rose encircled by a golden sun, known heraldically as a ‘white rose en soleil’ which is really a combination of two distinct badges. Both of these appear on the Great Seals of Edward IV and Richard III, and were used by George VI when Duke of York. Unlike the Lion of England, this beast is uncrowned.\n\nFrom the end of the 16th century, two unicorns were adopted as the supporters of the Scottish Royal Arms. In 1603, the crown of England passed to James VI of Scotland, who then became James I of England. He took as supporters of his Royal Arms a crowned lion of England and one of his Scottish unicorns. The unicorn holds a shield showing the Royal Arms of Scotland, a lion ramping in a royal tressure, adorned with fleur-de-lis.\n\nThe griffin of Edward III Queen's Beast is an ancient mythical beast. It was considered a beneficent creature, signifying courage and strength combined with guardianship, vigilance, swiftness and keen vision. It was closely associated with Edward III who engraved it on his private seal. The shield shows the Round Tower of Windsor Castle (where Edward III was born) with the Royal Standard flying from the turret, enclosed by two branches of oak surmounted by the royal crown.\n\nThe Black Bull of Clarence descended to the Queen through Edward IV. The shield shows the Royal Arms as they were borne by Edward IV and his brother Richard III as well as all the Sovereigns of the Houses of Lancaster and Tudor.\n\nThe falcon was first used by Edward III of the House of Plantagenet as his badge. It descended to Edward IV, who took it as his personal badge, the falcon being standing within an open fetterlock. Originally closed, the slightly open fetterlock is supposed to refer to the struggle Edward IV had to obtain the throne — \"he forced the lock and won the throne.\"\n\n\n"}

Akihiko was subsequently recruited into the ranks of the Legion on June 1983.\n\nHe then served in the French Foreign Legion for 20 years with the rank of Chief Adjutant (French: \"Adjudant-Chef\") before his departure. Saito was notably deployed with the French Foreign Legion's 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment, where he served in numerous combat operations in Africa. During his time with the Legion, he was based at Calvi/Corsica.\n\nAkihiko Saito had been working for Hart Security Ltd., a Cyprus-based British firm as a security specialist (under contract to PWC Logistics at the Abu Ghraib Warehouse Distribution Center near Baghdad International Airport) since December 2004 until his abduction by armed Jaish Ansar al-Sunna militants. He was ambushed alongside five other foreign contractors (mostly South African). However those foreign contractors were part of a convoy including twelve additional Iraqi security contractors along with five Iraqi truck drivers they were hired to safeguard; in total twenty three were killed in the ambush that took place in the town of Hit.\n\nHe was eventually killed by Jaish Ansar al-Sunna militants in a video released on the internet.\n\nVideo of a dead body was posted online May 27, purportedly by the group, along with his identification papers and passport; his identity in the video was visually confirmed by his brother Hironobu Saito, the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the Japanese National Police Agency and Hart Security.\n\nAccording to Al Jazeera, his presence in Iraq may have been used to legitimize the deployment of Japanese troops to Iraqi soil. His death was condemned by the Iraqi government. The Japanese government had condemned his death, saying that it will do little to hamper JSDF deployment to Iraq.\n\nHe was the sixth Japanese worker in Iraq to be taken hostage; two others had been killed and three released unharmed.

{"id": "1957993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957993", "title": "Jimmy Governor", "text": "Jimmy Governor\n\nJimmy Governor (1875 – 18 January 1901) was an Indigenous Australian who was notorious across Australia for the murders in 1900 of four members of the Mawbey family and their woman boarder, which quickly became known as the Breelong Massacre. He committed the murders with fellow indigenous worker Jacky Underwood at Breelong, ten miles from Gilgandra in the Central West region of New South Wales. Jimmy Governor and Jack Underwood then took to the bush, together with Jimmy's younger brother, Joe Governor. Underwood was captured just a few days later on 24 July, the same day that a reward of £200 for the capture of each was offered by the government, later increased on 25 September 1900 to £1,000 each. The government instituted a process on 5 October 1900 to proclaim the Governor brothers outlaws so that, when they failed to appear at a police station by the afternoon of 16 October 1900, they became outlaws, who could legally be shot and killed on sight.\n\nJimmy and Joe had parted early from Jack Underwood, at Digilah Station north of Dunedoo on Sunday 22 July when they were first shot at by a settler named Simpson. Underwood was almost 40 years old (he told a gaoler 37 yrs), had lost the sight of one eye in childhood and had a lameness in his leg that caused him to drag his left foot. He would not have been able to travel on foot as quickly as the Governors. Underwood was captured two days later on 24 July at Redbank near Leadville, taken to Mudgee Gaol, and then Dubbo Gaol where he was held until his September trial and execution on 14 January 1901. Over the next three months the two Governor brothers, styling themselves bushrangers, committed four more murders and carried on a series of break-ins, robberies, and assaults. They showed great skill, ingenuity and bush craft in avoiding their pursuers. The manhunt that got underway to capture them was reputedly Australia's largest. Up to 2,000 volunteers and police were involved in the hunt for them across 3,000 km of country.\n\nJimmy Governor and Jack Underwood had attacked the Breelong victims on Friday night, 20 July 1900 with tomahawk and waddies, and three died when they were attacked - the woman boarder, Miss Helen Kerz who was the teacher at Breelong school; a son Percy Mawbey (14 yrs) and a daughter, Hilda (11 yrs). Another daughter, Grace (16 yrs) died on the Sunday, 22nd., The mother, Mrs Sarah Mawbey, died on Wednesday 25 October.\n\nAtmosphere of Terror- The Governor brothers' violent spree while at large created a reign of terror in the areas where they were moving through or had once lived, which \"completely monopolised public interest\". People residing in the large region between Dunedoo in the west and Singleton in the east, and later northward as far as Port Macquarie, lived in paranoid fear of attack. Settlers moved out of their homesteads on any news that the Governors were heading to their area, and women and children were brought together in towns for safety while men in their local area joined the pursuit. Business was at a standstill in many places in the Wollar/Denman/Merriwa areas. In particular, Jimmy first targeted the area of the Goulburn River around Wollar where he had once worked, to settle scores with men who had treated him badly. As the brothers outwitted and even taunted the police and trackers hunting them, public pressure grew for the police to capture them. They were proclaimed outlaws on 23 October 1900, the last persons to be so declared in NSW. Jimmy was captured by locals near Wingham on the Manning River on 27 October, and Joe was shot dead north of Singleton on 31 October 1900. Jimmy Governor was tried for murder in November 1900, and hanged at Darlinghurst Gaol on 18 January 1901. Jack Underwood was tried at Dubbo for the murder of Percy Mawbey, and found guilty. Underwood was hanged at Dubbo Gaol on 14 January 1901.\n\nJimmy Governor was born about 1875 to Thomas Grosvenor, who became known as Governor, and Annie Fitzgerald, near Denison Town in the Talbragar region. The land administrative parish of Talbragar covers an area from the Talbragar River near Dunedoo extending eastwards towards the village of Uarbry.\n\nHis father, Tommy Governor was stated by others to have been a full-blood Aborigine. Tommy had self-reported (for Maitland Gaol records in 1890) that he came from the Williams River in Queensland. The Maitland Gaol description book recorded that he had scar marks across his chest. This indicates he was a full-blood Aborigine, who had undergone tribal initiation. A portrait drawing of him in an 1892 newspaper (as discoverer of silver at Mt Stewart) shows a steady, handsome man who appears to be a full blood Aborigine. Tommy Grosvenor/Governor probably headed south to NSW accompanying a drover or bullock team, and likely took the name of the drover in charge as his own 'European' name, as was a common approach among Aborigines in the mid-1800s. From newspaper reports in 1888, it appears Tommy had first lived in the Paterson River area (Singleton) before going westwards in NSW to the Talbragar River and Dunedoo/Denison Town area.\n\nAnnie Fitzgerald (Jimmy's mother) seems to have met Tommy Governor in the region of Talbragar/ Mundoran. Annie reportedly had an Aboriginal mother, and a white Irish father named Jack Fitzgerald who worked as a stockman on 'Caigan' station. 'Caigan' was a huge pastoral station held by squatter Andrew Brown and located in the area north-east of Mendooran and this would be where they met. Annie Fitzgerald's mother was \"Polly\", a local Aborigine on Caigan. One account of Annie has her born on 'Caigan', where her mother's Aboriginal people resided. The European-given names of Polly's family group, with whom Annie was raised, were Tommy, Penny, Jimmy, Maggie, Dicky, and others, according to local selectors who knew them and described them as \"an honest lot\".\n\nTommy, Annie and their children lived throughout this area from Jimmy's 1875 birth until about 1888 when Tommy took them east to the Paterson. Tommy seems to have been a good worker. He was an Aboriginal man who gained paid work in the European world, setting an example which Jimmy would follow. The family had been at Denison Town (nearer Dunedoo) to Uarbry 15 km further east, Gulgong further south and Wollar, a small village further east of Gulgong.\n\nThe family had also lived at Leadville, a village between Cassilis to its west and Dunedoo to the east. In June 1888 it was reported that it was not widely known that Tommy was the discoverer of silver at the Mt Stuart mine, (located near Leadville, and 14 km from Dunedoo). He was described as \"an old Aboriginal named Thomas Grosvenor, better known as Tommy 'Governor', who lately decided to go to the Paterson, his old hunting ground\" and he was presented with a purse of sovereigns before he left \"to help him on his journey\".\n\nA teenager in Singleton area. When Tommy moved his family back to the Paterson River in mid 1888 they lived outside Singleton. On New Year's Day 1890, a boy who was described as Tommy junior (most likely to have been Jimmy, since he was aged 15 and the eldest) won the high jump at the Gresford Sports Day. In July 1890, Tommy gave evidence as a court witness that he was then camping near Singleton. A police witness stated this camp was near Dunolly, implied to be an Aboriginal camp since all the other witnesses in the case were Aboriginal and also lived there. Later the same year Tommy was charged with wounding an aboriginal with a pen-knife over an altercation about cooking meat over the fire. The evidence was that the family lived in a tent at the \"black's camp\" near Singleton (as described by the police officer). At his trial there was a recommendation for mercy since Tommy believed himself justified in self-defence, and he got three months' jail.\n\nAfter several years near Singleton, Tommy then moved his family westwards back to the Gulgong area. Tommy held a variety of jobs over the years. A reference to Tommy in a Mudgee newspaper after his death referred to him as \"the Wollar tracker\"; his son Jimmy's 1898 marriage record referred to Tommy as a bullock driver.\n\nUntil he was about 13 years old (1888), Jimmy lived with his family in the Denison Town-Gulgong region. Former Gulgong residents reported in 1900 that, fifteen years earlier in 1885 and 1886, Jimmy had gone to school at Gulgong with his brothers but they had been teased there.\n\nAbout 1888, his family then moved to the Singleton area, where they all lived in the Aborigines' camp.\n\nIn the 1890s the family moved back to the Gulgong-Wollar area. Jimmy was then beyond school age. It appears the family lived in the Aborigines' camp at Wollar. Jimmy worked at Wollar. In mid 1896, he became a police tracker (Aboriginal tracker) at Cassilis, where he worked for eighteen months until 18 December 1897. The gossip about Jimmy suddenly leaving Cassilis as a tracker was that he wanted to avoid the family ire of a white girl who was pregnant to him. From a narrative he gave a journalist at Wingham just after his capture, his life during 1898 can be traced because he said he then went back to Wollar (where his family lived) and \"after a time I went to Gulgong wood-cutting for a man named Starr, then I went wool-rolling at Digilbar, then back to Gulgong.\" It was during this 1898 period back in Gulgong that he took up with Ethel Page since she was about five months' pregnant at their marriage in December 1898. \"I got married, and followed various occupations up to the time I went to work for Mr. Mawbey.\"\n\nJimmy had always worked, holding various jobs. After his police tracking work, he returned to Wollar in 1898, He must have met Ethel when he was working at Gulgong, and her family lived there.\n\nJimmy must have met Ethel Page when he was working at Gulgong after he resigned as a police tracker. Ethel's family was living at Gulgong in the second half of the 1890s. In 1898 Jimmy and Ethel married at the rectory of the Anglican church in Gulgong. Ethel was then aged 16, and was five months' pregnant with his child. She gave birth to their son, Sidney, registered at Gulgong in 1899. Ethel and Jimmy were expecting their second child at the time of the murders, a daughter, who was born in 1901, after Jimmy was hanged.\n\nEthel's background: Ethel had been born in 1882 on the Macleay River district near Kempsey. Her parents, Charles Page and Julia, née Moore, were both English and had separately migrated to NSW where they met, and they married at Kinchela Creek near Kempsey. In 1884 her father Charles Page, labourer, living at 'Clybucca' on the Macleay River, became insolvent. By 1893, when Ethel was then aged 11 years, Charles and Julia Page had moved to the Mudgee area -probably straight to Gulgong - since their fourth child's birth was registered at Mudgee. The family lived at Gulgong for a number of years as the births of the next two children were registered in 1897 and 1899 at Gulgong, where her father worked as a labourer.\n\nRidicule of their marriage: Jimmy and Ethel were subjected to ridicule from other people since inter-racial marriages were not accepted kindly at that time, especially where the wife was white. Few specific vilifying comments about Jimmy and Ethel have been recorded, other than those of the Mawbey women. However, some indication is given by this newspaper article immediately after the murders: \"Why She Married an Aboriginal\", and the comments: \"[Jimmy Governor] only consented, it is said, to perform the [marriage] ceremony at the earnest solicitation of the girl's mother, who, for reasons which may be understood, wished to save her daughter's reputation. One naturally wonders what manner of woman the mother was who insisted on uniting her daughter for life to a low-bred savage aboriginal.\" The same newspaper noted that \"The country people say rough and nasty things of her\".\n\nAs a deeper example of the attitudes of white people at that time, the following was written of Ethel on her remarriage in the year Jimmy was executed: \"'The second marriage is just as repulsive as the first, for the bride groom is a half-caste, and in spite of all her faults the woman is white. That the institution of marriage should be for such degrading and soul destroying unions is disgraceful'.\"\n\nIn April 1900, Jimmy Governor had contracted with John Mawbey to do some fencing on the Mawbey's selection (farming property) located at Breelong, ten miles from Gilgandra, on the Gilgandra-Mendooran road. Jimmy's wife, Ethel, was given some paid housework in the Mawbeys' new house on their property. Jimmy, Ethel and members of Jimmy's extended family who were assisting with the fencing work, were living about 3 miles from the new Mawbey house, (and 4 miles from the old one) near a creek on the property.\n\nEthel gave evidence about their time at Mawbey's place. They had been camped there doing the work about four months. The other Aboriginal people camping were Jimmy's brother Joe; Jack Underwood (who had the disability of only one eye), who had been at Mawbey's for only about six weeks; Jack Porter who was an old Aborigine and had been there only two weeks, with a boy named Peter Governor who Ethel named as Jimmy's nephew. Jack Porter said at the Inquest that he had arrived from the Redbend Mission (near Coonamble). Ethel and Jimmy, with their baby son, had their own camp on the creek; Joe was with Jack Underwood about 100 yards away in a separate camp, and old Porter and the boy Peter were about another 100 yards away.\n\nJimmy had asked John Mawbey for more rations (basic food items like flour and sugar), but Mawbey was not prepared to give any more until the contract job was finished.\n\nEthel told Jimmy about taunts from Mrs Mawbey because she was a white woman married to a black.\n\nOn the night of the murder, John Mawbey, his brother-in-law Fred Clarke, and eldest son were staying overnight at their old house (an old inn and post office located on the property) because they were bagging wheat until late.\n\nJimmy, wanting to confront Mrs Mawbey about the things she was saying to Ethel, went on the night of 20 July 1900, with his friend Jacky Underwood (aka Charles Brown), to the house where the Mawbey women were living. He made different statements at different points about what had happened, but at his trial which, specifically, was for the murder of Helen Kerz, Jimmy stated that he had gone to see Mrs Sarah Mawbey \"to make her mind about what she is talking about. I'll take her to court if she does not mind herself.\" He stated also that Mrs Mawbey and the governess, Helen Kerz, insulted him about his wife and his colour.\n\n\"I went up to the house. I said, 'Are you in, Mrs. Mawbey? Did you tell my missus that any white woman who married a blackfellow ought to be shot? Did you ask my wife about our private business ? Did you ask her what sort of nature did I have - black or white?'\"\n\nWith that Mrs. Mawbey and Miss Kerz turned round and laughed at me with a sneering laugh, and before I got the words out of my mouth that I said in court I struck Mrs. Mawbey on the mouth with this nullah-nullah. Miss Kerz said, \" Pooh, you black rubbish, you want shooting for marrying a white woman.\" With that I hit her with my hand on the jaw, and I knocked her down. Then I got out of temper and got hammering them, and lost control of myself. I do not remember anything after that.\" (Report of trial, SMH 24 November 1900 p.1)\n\nFour members of the Mawbey family were murdered: Mrs Sarah Mawbey and three of her children, Hilda, Percy and Grace, together with school teacher Helen Kerz, on the night of 20 July. A surviving witness, 9 year old Albert Mawbey who'd hidden under a bed, ran to the 'old' house on the property where his father was, and raised the alarm. \"After he first struck Miss Kerz she ran 100 yards, and Governor, with a murderous implement in his hand, pursued her and beat her head in.\" He then pursued Hilda Mawbey, who had tried to escape with Miss Kerz, and beat her to death.\n\nA hunt for the men ensued, as Jimmy, Joe and friend Jack Underwood went on a robbing, murderous spree eastwards in the Hunter Valley area. resulting in a large manhunt that followed was of over 100 constables and 12 trackers.\n\nOther murders along the way were not random events, but had a motive of revenge for slights given at some earlier time in Jimmy's life.\nOne of the most notable trackers involved in the pursuit was a friend of Jimmy, James Gillis McDonald from Mudgee, at whom Jimmy fired a warning shot that ricocheted off of his saddle. It was later revealed that during the terror, the woman who raised James Gillis McDonald's daughter was hiding under a bed, was shot in the leg and had it amputated.\n\nAlexander McKay was killed near Ulan on 23 July. Elizabeth O'Brien and her 18 month old son were murdered at Poggie, a near Merriwa, on 24 July; and Keiran Fitzpatrick near Wollar, on 26 July.\n\nJimmy Governor was shot in the mouth on 13 October, and was subsequently captured on 27 October 1900, several months after the massacre. His brother, Joe Governor, was shot and killed four days later on 31 October at Mount Royal near Singleton. Convicted of murder, Jimmy was hanged the following year. Jacky Underwood was hanged at Old Dubbo Gaol on 14 January 1901.\n\nThe police cell in which Jimmy Governor was first detained after his capture can be seen in Wingham, on display at the Manning Valley Historical Society Museum opposite Central Park and The Log in the centre of Wingham.\n\nThe life of Jimmy Governor was the basis for Thomas Keneally's 1972 novel \"The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith\", which was filmed by Fred Schepisi in 1978.\n\nIt is also the subject of Australian poet Les Murray's poem \"The Ballad of Jimmy Governor\".\n\n\n"}

The princely family of Auersperg was a junior branch of the house of Counts of Auersperg from Carniola, one of the hereditary Habsburg duchies and what is now in Slovenia. It rose to princely status in 1653 and after acquiring Tengen, they became immediate Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. The princes of Auersperg also held at various times the duchies of Münsterberg and Gottschee. Their territories were mediatised by Austria and Baden in 1806. The family is counted as high nobility.\n\nThe former \"edelfrei\" family was first mentioned as \"Ursperch\" in an 1162 deed issued by Duke Herman II of Carinthia at his residence St. Veit. Their ancestral seat was Turjak Castle (, later \"Burg Auersperg\") in the March of Carniola, according to an engraving on site built in 1067 by one Conrad of Auersperg. Above the engraving stands the original Auersperg coat of arms, displaying an aurochs (German: \"Auerochs(e)\" or \"Ur\", Slovene: \"Tur\"). The family name may derive from Ursberg in Swabia, their ancestors probably settled in Lower Carniola after the victory of King Otto I of Germany over the Hungarian forces at the 955 Battle of Lechfeld. They held large estates from Grosuplje in the north down to Velike Lašče and Ribnica, rivalling with the Meinhardiner counts of Görz, the Carinthian Ortenburg dynasty and the Patriarchs of Aquileia.\n\nIn the 13th century, the high noble line became extinct and was succeeded by a dynasty of \"ministeriales\". In the mid 15th century, this line split into two eponymous branches with the brothers Pankraz II (1441–1496) and Volkhard VIII (1442–1508). The Auerspergs inherited the estate of Žužemberk and Šumberk in the Windic March, which passed on to a cadet branch. Pankraz II of Auersperg held Turjak Castle in the Duchy of Carniola, married with Anne of Frankopan. His son Trojan (1495–1541) served at the Habsburg courts in Ljubljana and the Austrian capital Vienna as a Carniolan chamberlain and regent, Imperial \"Hofrat\" and commander during the Ottoman Siege of Vienna in 1529. Trojan's son Herbard VIII von Auersperg (1528–1575), called \"Hervard Turjaški\" in Slovene, was Carniolan \"Landeshauptmann\" and commander of the Croatian and Slavonian Military Frontier, he played a vital role as a patron of Primož Trubar, Jurij Dalmatin and the Protestant Reformation in the Slovene Lands. He received the noble rank of an Imperial Baron (\"Reichsfreiherren\") in 1550, his descendants were elevated to Imperial Counts (\"Reichsgrafen\") in 1630.\n\nThe Auersperg cadet branch, named after the castle of Šumberk in Lower Carniola, was influential throughout the 16th century. Wilhelm Auersperg (called \"the Rich\", cca. 1462–1507) and his nephew Hans (1480–1529) were regents (\"Landeshauptmann\") of Carniola. Hans's son Wolfgang-Engelbert was considered one of the most educated noblemen in Carniola, and a strong supporter of Lutheranism. His son Andreas von Auersperg was one of the military commanders during the decisive Battle of Sisak against the Ottomans, gaining the nickname \"Carniolan Achilles\". In the early 17th century, the Šumberk cadet line, which was considered wealthier and more influential than the main one, died out; its estates were transferred back to the main line, and were later mostly inherited by the so-called \"princely branch\" of the family.\n\nCount Johann Weikhard of Auersperg (1615–1677) served as head of the Aulic Council (\"Reichshofrat\"), as envoy of Emperor Ferdinand III in the negotiations preparing the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, and as a tutor to young King Ferdinand IV. Emperor Ferdinand III elevated him to a hereditary Prince of the Holy Roman Empire in 1653 and enfeoffed him with the Silesian Duchy of Münsterberg in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown the next year. In 1663 Johann Weikhard received in pawn the lands of the extinct Counts of Tengen (\"Thengen\"), a Habsburg possession in Further Austria since 1522, and reached Imperial immediacy as \"Gefürsteter Graf\" with a seat in the Imperial Diet the next year.\n\nThe Duchy of Münsterberg was conquered by Prussia in the course of the First Silesian War with Austria in 1742, nevertheless the Auerspergs at first could retain their possessions as a Silesian state country. In 1791 Karl Joseph of Auersperg finally sold Münsterberg to King Frederick William II of Prussia. In the same year, Emperor Leopold II elevated him to the Duke of Gottschee and the Auersperg owned County of Gottschee to the Duchy of Gottschee (German: \"Herzogtum Gottschee\", Slovene: \"Kočevska Vojvodina\"). Upon the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Auersperg territory at Tengen was mediatised to the Grand Duchy of Baden.\n\n\nThe Auerspergs were among the largest landowners in Carniola. In addition to Turjak Castle, which was their central possession, for centuries they were the owners of many other properties, both within and outside their territories. Among these were two Baroque palaces in the center of Ljubljana, \"Turjaška palača\" (Auersperg Palace) and (Princely Palace). They were both damaged in the 1895 Easter earthquake and the land was sold to the municipality. The Slovene National and University Library was built on the site of the Princely Palace in the 1930s, modelled on the latter's size and form. The City Museum of Ljubljana was opened at the Auersperg Palace in 1937.\n\nPalais Auersperg is a Baroque palace at Auerspergstrasse 1 in the Josefstadt or eighth district of Vienna. The palace was owned by the family from 1777 to 1953.\n\nTurjak Castle and all the other Slovenian property was seized by the government of Yugoslavia in 1946. It has never been returned to the head of the family. Other branches however still own property in Austria and Southern Tyrol (Italy):\n\n"}

Ascot Park Hotel Southern Sting was not even ranked by pundits at the start of the new Coca-Cola Cup season and franchise holder Southern TeamCo was hoping for a top four finish.\n\nBut the team had other ideas, and so did its supporters. From day one, Southlanders were behind the team and players were astonished when they arrived for their first game at Centennial Hall on Friday, 27 March. The car park and surrounding streets were full and the game was a sell-out.\n\nThe starting line-up against the Auckland Diamonds was Donna Loffhagen and Camille Grubb shooting, Kirsty Broughton, Tasha Marshall and Reinga Bloxham through the mid-court and Bernice Mene and Michelle Krynen on defence. Debbie Munro came into the shooting circle in the third quarter and Southern Sting won 55–51, a major boost to the team, which then went on to Christchurch to another win, this time against the Canterbury Flames, 55–53, on Sunday, 29 March.\n\nThe team had another double-header the next weekend, with both games at home in front of sell-out crowds. The first game, against the Waikato Wildcats, was a walk-over, with Sting winning easily 78–41. On the Sunday it was a different story. Sting was up against the favourites, the Otago Rebels, and lost 54–61, but the fans never bagged the team.\n\nSting played the next game away and after being five down with four minutes left, came back to beat the Shakers 50–48.\n\nHalfway through the season and a record of four wins, one loss, Sting was looking good and took another win, 56–39, against the Northern Force away from home. However, its star shooter Loffhagen was injured and missed the next game, against the CMTV Cometz, which the Sting lost narrowly, 42–44.\n\nA week later, Loffhagen was still unable to play and the Sting played the Bay of Plenty Magic away from home, beating it 50–43. Then it was back home for the final round robin game, against the Western Flyers and with Loffhagen playing. It was on fire to win 68–48.\n\nSting was second equal with the Flames on the points table, behind the Rebels, but Sting had scored 80 more goals than the Flames and so took the home semi-final after some issues around television coverage. It took only half an hour to sell all the available tickets for the semi-final and 60 minutes to just beat the Flames 59–58, thanks in part to the unbroken noise from the fans. The Rebels beat the Diamonds to gain the home advantage in the final a week later, but that was no deterrent to intrepid Sting fans. Operation Sting swung into place, with university students, from Southland, paid to wait overnight to buy extra tickets for Southlanders. Then the Southlanders themselves lined up, some for 35 hours, to get the tickets.\n\nA convoy of 13 buses chartered by the Invercargill Licensing Trust took many of the Southland fans to Dunedin for the final, which see-sawed between the Rebels being well out in front, to the Sting leading, to the Rebels pulling away finally to win 57–50. But as a letter to The Southland Times said, the team \"did us proud.\"\n\n2007 Squad\n\n2007 Season (Sting first) \n\nThe Sting took the 2007 title to regain the National Bank Cup for the 7th and final time from the Northern Force in Auckland 50–49. Coach Robyn Broughton featured in her 100th match, and the cup returned to its home after two seasons with the Waikato/BOP Magic. \nThrough the regular season, the Sting defeated out some tough opposition, including the Auckland Diamonds and Otago Rebels. \nMagic were knocked out of the competition a week earlier in Invercargill by the Sting, 50–48. Former Silver Fern Julie Coney believing it was the competition's best ever match.\n\nThrough the season, the Invercargill based team won all but one round robin game. Favourites to take the title, their season was put in question when they went down to the Silver Fern studded Northern Force in the major semi-final. But fighting back, Sting celebrated with a city parade a month later after the final, where Invercargill mayor Tim Shadbolt congratulated the team. The competition's cup still sits proudly in the Stadium Southland trophy cabinet, alongside the national league's old cup – the Coca-Cola.\n\nRobyn Broughton coached the Southern Sting for all ten years of the National Bank Cup. During her time she won seven National Bank Cup and Coca-Cola Cup titles, and led her team to every single final. She also spent three years as assistant coach of the Silver Ferns from 1998 to 2000. Robyn has also held other national coaching positions including the head coach of the New Zealand A squad, and is currently in charge of the Silver Ferns Fastnet team. \nRobyn would be joined by several assistant's during the ten years of the Sting. Julie Carter, Tania Dalton and Belinda Colling all had stints as assistant coach for various reasons including injury.\nIn 2008, when the ANZ Championship started, Broughton successfully applied for the role as coach of the Southern Steel. She guided the team to the finals series twice in four seasons and retired from coaching in 2011.\n\n\n"}

She has also achieved popularity in several other countries, including four Top 30 hits in Sweden, six Top 30 hits in Australia and seven Top 20 hits in Finland. Her other hit singles include \"Pray\" (1998), \"Killin' Time\" (1999), \"Forever\" (1999), \"Just Around the Hill\" with Sash! (2000) and \"Wonderful Life\" (2005).\n\nCousins' first big break was in the music industry, appearing on German DJ/producer team Sash!'s single \"Mysterious Times\" in 1998. Before \"Mysterious Times\", Cousins had released \"Killin' Time\" and \"Angel\" in March and June 1997 respectively.\n\nFollowing the success of \"Mysterious Times\", she had two further UK Top 20 hits with the follow-up \"Pray\", released in November 1998, which also achieved success in the US, and the 1999 re-release of \"Killin' Time\". Follow-up singles \"Forever\" and the reissued \"Angel\" reached the UK Top 50 (though a published recount of the singles chart showed that \"Forever\" actually reached #38 rather than the previously published #45). Cousins turned her attention to Australia where the song, \"Forever\" achieved gold sales. \"Pray\" was also a success in Australia, reaching the Top 10 and becoming her second gold single in the ARIA Charts where it remained for more than four months.\n\nWhilst in Australia on a promotional tour, she re-recorded her track \"Nothing to Fear\" and had it remixed by the Groove Peddlers. This became her third Australian single, and the video was also shot there.\n\nCousins joined Billie Piper, Cleopatra, B*Witched and Steps on the track \"Thank ABBA for the Music\", a medley of ABBA hits that they performed as a tribute at the Brit Awards. The single was released and reached the Top 10 in the UK, Republic of Ireland, Sweden, Australia and New Zealand. In 2000, she again collaborated with Sash!, on the UK Top 10 hit \"Just Around the Hill\".\n\nIn 2005, Cousins released her first single in five years with \"Wonderful Life\", a cover of the Black song, which had originally been released in Australia. In 2007, \"Wonderful Life\" was adopted by Hoyts as their primary pre-feature theme music. \"Wonderful Life\" reached No. 15 in Australia and spent four months in the Top 50, becoming her biggest radio hit.\n\nThe follow-up single was \"Come to Me\". Both singles were taken from her second album \"Mastermind\", which reached the UK and Australian Top 50. The third single to be taken from the album, \"Pretty Young Thing\", was released in two CD formats, one of which was limited to 1,000 pressings. The single reached the Australian Top 30.\n\nCousins made a guest appearance on \"Never Mind the Buzzcocks\", a UK television comedy panel show, which was broadcast on 2 November 2006, in the game's Identity Parade.\n\nDuring late 2006, dance format radio station WMPH became the first US station to put any of Cousin's singles in regular rotation. In 2007, she co-wrote and performed vocals on two songs on the \"Main Line\" album by Dutch group 4 Strings. The track \"Curious\" became a Top 30 Hot Dance Airplay hit.\n\nOn 7 March 2009, Cousins announced on her website that a new track had been recorded along with a film clip for a new single called \"Can't Hold Back\". This song is with Bellatrax and was released in the US and the UK on Michael Gray's Eye Industries label in late summer 2009. In April 2009, Cousins announced that she had recorded a cover version of \"Sex on Fire\", originally by the Kings of Leon. The track was produced by Topham & Twigg and was released on iTunes UK on 2 September. She signed a worldwide deal with Sony Music International in September 2010, and \"Sex on Fire\" was released worldwide in autumn 2010.\n\nThe video for \"Sex on Fire\" was leaked to YouTube in October 2010. The video is most notable for its explicit scenes. The pop music blog, Popjustice, described it as \"another exercise in awful and amazing\".\n\nFrom 2010 Tina also released new music with the singles \"Everlong\", \" Love Comes Back\", \"Diamonds\" and \"When Tomorrow Comes\".\n\nIn 2014 she also recorded and released a new track \"Screams\" with Kalsi and Applejack. In 2015 she also recorded a new track \"Bullet In The Gun\" – remake of Planet Perfecto's late 1990s dance hit – with Probaker and Kalsi.\n\nCousins divides her time between Australia and the UK, performing regularly.\n\nIn November 2016, she toured Australia with the Vengaboys, Sonique, Whigfield and Joanne Accom.\n\n\nHer website is dead no entries since 2012 and her booking agency the website is gone.\n"}

He played college football for the University of Iowa, and was a two-time All-American. He was originally drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in the fourth round of the 1998 NFL Draft, and he played professionally for the Falcons, San Diego Chargers, New England Patriots, New York Jets and Oakland Raiders of the NFL.\n\nDwight is remembered for his 94-yard touchdown return on a kickoff in Super Bowl XXXIII against the Denver Broncos.\n\nDwight attended the University of Iowa, where he played for the Iowa Hawkeyes football team. He finished his college career with Big Ten Conference records for punt return yardage (1,102) and punts returned for touchdowns (5); his yardage mark has since been eclipsed by three others and Ted Ginn Jr. surpassed his return touchdown mark. Dwight held the Hawkeyes team record for career receiving touchdowns (21) until 2011, when his mark was surpassed by Marvin McNutt. He held the team record for career receiving yards (2,271) until 2010 when Derrell Johnson-Koulianos became the all-time leader in receiving yards. In 1997, Dwight was a consensus first-team All-American and finished seventh in the balloting for the Heisman Trophy.\n\nOn December 12, 2014 the Big Ten Network included Dwight on \"The Mount Rushmore of Iowa Football\", as chosen by online fan voting. Dwight was joined in the honor by Nile Kinnick, Chuck Long and Alex Karras.\n\nOn November 24, 2015, an annual award from the Big Ten Conference was created in honor of Dwight and Johnny Rodgers called the Rodgers-Dwight Return Specialist of the Year. \n\nDwight also competed in track events, with personal bests of 10.31 seconds in the 100 meters and 20.98 seconds in the 200 meters; in 1999, he was Big Ten Champion in the 100-meter dash, and he also was a member of the Big Ten champion 4x400-meter relay and 4x100-meter relay teams in 1999, and the Big Ten champion 4x100-meter relay team in 1998.\n\nDwight was drafted in the fourth round (114th overall) of the 1998 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons. In Super Bowl XXXIII, he returned five kickoffs, including one for 94 yards and a touchdown. He is second all-time in Super Bowl kick return yardage for a single game (210), and his 42.0 yards per return in the game was a Super Bowl career record. Dwight is also known as \"The Man\".\n\nAfter three seasons with Atlanta, Dwight was traded on April 20, 2001 to the San Diego Chargers as part of the deal that enabled the Falcons to select quarterback Michael Vick with the 2001 draft's top selection (which the Chargers originally held pursuant to their 1-15 record in 2000).\n\nDwight became a free agent following the 2004 season, and on March 11, 2005, he signed with the New England Patriots. As a New England Patriot, Dwight caught 19 passes for 332 yards and 3 touchdowns and also gained 523 yards returning punts and kickoffs.\n\nAfter the 2005 NFL season, Dwight signed a four-year contract to play for the New York Jets, and was expected to play as the fourth wide receiver and perform return duties. \n\nFor the 2006 season, Dwight played in nine games totaling 16 receptions for 112 yards, before being placed on IR in early December. He also had 146 punt return yards.\n\nDwight signed a one-year contract with the Oakland Raiders in October 2007. He returned one kickoff, and totaled 98 yards and two touchdowns as a receiver. He became a free agent after that season but did not play in the NFL in 2008.\n\nDespite being only 5'8\" tall and weighing 185 pounds, Dwight was a prolific punt and kick returner during his career. He was labeled \"injury-prone\" because he rarely played a season without missing a significant number of games. The 2005 season was the only season in which Dwight appeared in all 16 of his team's games. Dwight's most productive seasons as a wide receiver have been 1999, when he caught 32 passes for 669 yards (a 20.9-yard average per catch) with seven touchdowns, and 2002, when he caught 50 passes for 623 yards. He also scored five return touchdowns in the NFL — three on punts and two on kickoffs.\n\nDwight has a number of interests outside football. He founded the Tim Dwight Foundation to help needy kids with scholarships and provide assistance to the Children's Hospital of Iowa. He also owns his own yoga studio in Iowa.\n\nIn 2007, \"The Cedar Rapids (Iowa) Gazette\" sports staff voted Dwight the all-time greatest athlete from that newspaper's circulation area, topping other notables like NFL quarterback Kurt Warner and 2007 Masters champion Zach Johnson\n\n\n"}

Following a neck injury that cut his playing career short after four seasons, he began serving as a coach in the collegiate and professional levels and obtained his first head coaching position with the Birmingham Iron of the Alliance of American Football (AAF) in 2019. He currently serves as the defensive backs coach for the St. Louis BattleHawks of the XFL.\n\nHe is the younger brother of former Memphis Express General Manager Will Lewis.\n\nLewis was a first round pick (eleventh player chosen overall) out of the University of Pittsburgh by the Green Bay Packers in the 1983 NFL Draft. A standout cornerback, he was considered to be one of the more skilled players on what was a relatively weak Packers team. He led or shared the team in interceptions in 1983 & 1985, finishing with a career total of 16. His 99-yard interception return for a touchdown against the Los Angeles Rams on November 18, 1984, remains the Packer team record. His career was cut short by a severe neck injury suffered in a Monday Night game against the Chicago Bears in the third week of the 1986 season.\n\nBeginning his coaching career in 1987 at Texas A&M, Lewis served under his former college coach at Pittsburgh, Jackie Sherrill.

The headquarters were in Norman Court mansion, West Tytherley, to the east of the wood. NCOs and other ranks were encamped in Nissen huts erected within the wood. The facilities included a hospital in an extended Nissen hut.\n\nMost of the wood north of Livery Track was used. Some areas of the wood were laid to gravel to facilitate heavy vehicles, and Livery Track was widened and laid with macadam. A modest number of trees were felled to provide space.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, the wood was used temporarily to store vehicles and other equipment returning from Europe.\nIn 1950 Bentley Wood was acquired by the Forestry Commission, which undertook a large replanting programme to fill in the spaces that had been cleared to accommodate military facilities in the WWII period. In 1983 the UK Government decided to sell much of the woodland owned by the Forestry Commission, including Bentley Wood. A local resident, Lady Ann Colman, widow of Sir Nigel Colman, formed a trust with the purpose of purchasing Bentley Wood for the public, which was achieved shortly before her death in 1984.\n\nThe Bentley Wood Charitable Trust that she had formed was guided initially by Ralph Whitlock, a local farmer, conservationist and broadcaster.

The team was one of the founding teams in the National Bank Cup, formerly the premier netball competition in New Zealand (1998–2007), during which the team was known as the Canterbury Flames. After the NBC was retired in 2007, the Flames became a founding franchise of the new trans-Tasman ANZ Championship and changed their name to the Canterbury Tactix. In 2013 they changed their name to Mainland Tactix, to clearly state what region they are from. The Mainland team represent the New Zealand regions of Canterbury, West Coast, Nelson and Marlborough.\n\nThe Tactix have had mixed results during their competitive history. The \"Flames\" finished second in four seasons of the NBC, but since the start of the ANZ Championship the \"Tactix\" have finished no higher than sixth.\n\nHome games for the Tactix are played at the 7200-seat Horncastle Arena in Christchurch. In 2012 it was announced that a game would be played in Nelson for the first time. The team uniform is primarily red and black, in line with traditional Canterbury Rugby Union colours. Their alternate uniform has the black and red colours reversed. \n\nIn 2019 \"The Good Oil\" became the naming right sponsor for the Tactix . Prior to this they have had naming sponsors such as Silvermoon in 2017, Easiyo In 2012 and Mercury Energy In 2009.\n\nThe ANZ Championship was founded in 2007 as the new elite domestic netball competition in New Zealand and Australia. It replaced the National Bank Cup in New Zealand and the Commonwealth Bank Trophy in Australia, which both played their final season in 2007. When the new trans-Tasman competition was announced, the competition was reported to feature five teams from each country. For the new competition, five New Zealand franchises were formed from amalgamations of National Bank Cup teams. A franchise based in Canterbury was an obvious selection. They were a direct replacement of the Canterbury Flames from the NBC.\n\nThe Tactix, like most of the New Zealand-based teams, struggled in their first season, ending up a disappointing 8th. They were coached by Helen Mahon-Stroud and were captained by ex-Silver Fern captain, Julie Seymour.\n\nTactix had their most successful year yet in 2009, finishing a respectful 6th, picking up several famous wins along the way. The Tactix have since come 10th every year since.\n\n2010 saw the retirement of veteran Julie Seymour, and the Tactix finished last for the first time. Maree Bowden took up the captaincy for 2010, while Donna Wilkins co-captained in 2011. 2011 saw the 2011 Christchurch earthquake which severely disrupted their season, leaving them with another wooden spoon, despite having a decent team on paper. 2011 import Kasey Evering suffered an ACL injury midseason, leaving the defence end light.\n\nThe fallout from the earthquake continued, with recruitment made harder, and finances difficult and the city was in rebuild mode. Tactix were allowed a second import to help balance this, although Stacey Francis was injured for most of the season. Joanne Harten was the other import signed for the 2012 season, along with Elizabeth Manu from the Central Pulse and midcourter Keshia Grant, to go with the remaining members from previous years. Helen Mahon-Stroud stood down from the job, and ex-Silver Ferns coach Leigh Gibbs was named as head coach, a position she has retained for the 2013 season.\n\nRegardless, the Tactix finished last for the third time running, although they did win two games (2010 and 2011 yielded only one win each) and managed to beat an Australian team for the first time since 2009 (the NSW Swifts).\n\nThe Tactix have made several changes for the 2013 season (including their region name), mainly to cover the loss of captain Maree Bowden, and Anna Galvan, who have both retired. They were once again allowed two imports, which they used to re-sign English shooter Joanne Harten, and also the English captain and former Northern Mystics midcourter Jade Clarke. They have also signed Silver Ferns squad member Julianna Naoupu in place of foundation member Ellen Halpenny.\n\nCompeted as the \"Canterbury Flames\".\n\n\n"}

The series, which was originally created by O'Barr as a means of dealing with the death of his girlfriend at the hands of a drunk driver, was first published by Caliber Comics in 1989. It became an underground success, and was later adapted into a film of the same name in 1994. Three film sequels, a television series, and numerous books and comic books (published by numerous companies) have also been subsequently produced.\n\n\"The Crow\" has been translated into almost a dozen languages and has sold around 750,000 copies worldwide.\n\nThe Crow first appeared on the back cover of \"Deadworld\" #10 (November 1988); James O'Barr provided a back cover to the first comic book Caliber Press published, which contained an advertisement for the upcoming The Crow appearance in \"Caliber Presents\" #1. (The ads shows The Crow standing with a smoking shotgun in one hand and a samurai sword in the other, with the statement, \"For Some Things...There Is No Forgiveness\". It mentions The Crow appearing in February 1989.)\n\nThe Crow's first in-story appearance was in \"Caliber Presents\" #1 (January 1989), in the story \"Inertia\", which serves as a prequel to the main series. O'Barr again provided a back cover for this issue.\n\nThe character's first limited series was \"The Crow\" #1–4 (February–May 1989). Four issues, titled \"Pain\", \"Fear\", \"Irony\", and \"Despair,\" take readers through a series of vengeance tales as The Crow cuts and shoots through Tin-Tin, Tom-Tom, Top Dollar, Funboy and T-Bird, the gang members that attacked and killed him and his lover Shelly.\n\nIn \"A Caliber Christmas\" (December 1989), Eric reflects back on happier times with Shelly in the story \"Atmosphere.\" (In \"The Crow\" graphic novel, this story is placed between issues #2 and 3.)\n\n\"Caliber Presents\" #15 (September 1990) contained a preview of the unpublished \"The Crow\" #5, titled \"Death\", that was meant to complete the original story arc.\n\nTundra Publishing later reprinted Caliber's first four issues in two double-sized volumes and printed \"Death\" (also double-sized) as the third volume.\n\nIn 1993, Kitchen Sink Press collected The Crow into a graphic novel. A limited hardcover edition was also released by Graphitti Designs.\n\nFrom 1996–1998, Kitchen Sink published five mini-series and a one-shot based on The Crow concept with a new avatar in each series.\n\nFollowing the Kitchen Sink series, London Night Studios published \"The Crow/Razor: Kill the Pain\" in 1998, which saw Eric Draven paired with Everette Hartsoe's bad girl character Razor.\n\nIn 1999, Image Comics released a new \"Crow\" comic series with yet another take on the Eric Draven story. It ran for ten issues, ending in November of that year.\n\nIn 2002, Pocket Books re-released the original Crow graphic novel after several years out-of-print.\n\nO'Barr stated in a 2004 interview that an Author's Edition would contain at least \"60 pages of new material that no one has ever seen. Half of that are pages that had to be removed for space reasons.\" O'Barr described the additions as including \"more romance flashback scenes between Eric and Shelly,\" as well as sequences that would make the work \"more visually interesting.\" On January 16, 2010, it was announced on O'Barr's official website that the Author's Edition of \"The Crow\" was indeed going to be released and that O'Barr was currently working on it. On April 7, 2011, O'Barr announced that \"The Crow: Special Edition\" would be released on July 28, 2011, from Gallery Books.\n\nIn July 2012, IDW Publishing published a new five-issue Crow series, \"The Crow: Death and Rebirth\", written by novelist John Shirley (co-writer of the original Crow film) and illustrated by Kevin Colden.\n\nFour more IDW \"Crow\" series followed: \"The Crow: Skinning the Wolves\" (2013), \"The Crow: Curare\" (2013), \"The Crow: Pestilence\" (2014) and \"The Crow: Memento Mori\" (2018).\n\nThe story revolves around an unfortunate young man named Eric. He and his fiancée, Shelly, are assaulted by a gang of street thugs after their car breaks down. Eric is shot in the head and is paralyzed, and can only watch as Shelly is savagely beaten, raped, and shot in the head. They are then left for dead on the side of the road. Eric later dies in the hospital operating room while Shelly is DOA.\n\nHe is resurrected by a crow and seeks vengeance on the murderers, methodically stalking and killing them. When not on the hunt, Eric stays in the house he shared with Shelly, spending most of his time there lost in memories of her. Her absence is torture for him; he is in emotional pain, even engaging in self-mutilation by cutting himself.\n\nThe crow acts as both a guide and goad for Eric, giving him information that helps him in his quest but also chastising him for dwelling on Shelly's death, seeing his pining as useless self-indulgence that distracts him from his purpose.\n\n\n\"The Crow\" is ranked 37th in IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes. In 2005, creator James O'Barr claimed that \"The Crow\" was:\n\nWorld Championship Wrestling superstar Sting portrayed a character inspired by The Crow beginning in late 1996. As this character, Sting was involved in a major storyline with Hulk Hogan and the New World Order throughout 1997 and early 1998.\n\nIn 1994, a film based on the comic (titled \"The Crow\") was released to theaters by Miramax Films. The film was both a critical and commercial success, earning $50,693,129 total gross during its 1994 United States theatrical release. A cult following, in part due to the accidental death of its star Brandon Lee on the film's set, has maintained the film's popularity, with a regular staple of movie memorabilia being found at retailers like Hot Topic. Three sequels have been made so far: \"\" (1996), starring Vincent Pérez (as The Crow), Mia Kirshner, Richard Brooks and Iggy Pop; \"\" (2000), starring Eric Mabius (as The Crow), Kirsten Dunst and Fred Ward; and \"\" (2005), starring Edward Furlong (as The Crow), David Boreanaz and Tara Reid.\n\nIn the late 1990s, a sequel/reboot to \"The Crow\" entitled \"The Crow: 2037\" was in the works; it would be set in the future. It was written and scheduled to be directed by Rob Zombie, but it was ultimately cancelled.\n\nOn December 14, 2008, Stephen Norrington announced in \"Variety\" that he planned to write and direct a \"reinvention\" of \"The Crow\". Norrington distinguished between the original and his remake: \"Whereas Proyas’ original was gloriously Gothic and stylized, the new movie will be realistic, hard-edged and mysterious, almost documentary-style.\" In 2009 Ryan Kavanaugh's Relativity Media was negotiating with Edward R. Pressman for both the film's rights and financing. In May 2013, actor Luke Evans accepted the role of Eric Draven, with F. Javier Gutiérrez set to direct. According to James O'Barr the movie is expected to be much more faithful to the comic including flashbacks, metaphors, horses, trains and barbed wire, making it not suitable for younger audiences. Director Javier Gutiérrez also confirmed that his intentions are to create literally a page-by-page adaptation of the movie. Filming was slated to start in the spring of 2015 but on July 31, 2015, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" reported that production on the reboot stalled because of Relativity Media's bankruptcy.\n\nCorin Hardy was the next director to take on the film and O'Barr said in October 2017:\n\nOn May 31, 2018, it was announced that both director Hardy and star Jason Momoa had exited the project.\n\nA television series, \"\" (1998), was based on the first movie with Mark Dacascos replacing Lee in the role of Eric Draven.\n\nFrom 1996–2001, a number of novels based on the world and thematic concerns of The Crow were published, mostly by Harper. Authors of these novels included such notable names as Chet Williamson, David Bischoff, Poppy Z. Brite, S. P. Somtow, Norman Partridge, and A. A. Attanasio.\n\nIn 1998, O'Barr and editor Ed Kramer asked an array of fiction writers, poets, and artists—including Gene Wolfe, Alan Dean Foster, Charles de Lint, Jack Dann, Jane Yolen, Henry Rollins and Iggy Pop—to interpret this Gothic fiction phenomenon. \"The Crow: Shattered Lives and Broken Dreams\" was released by Random House on Halloween; and a year later, in a limited signed and numbered volume, by Donald M. Grant Publishing.\n\n\"\" is a 1997 action video game for Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Windows. It is loosely based on the . The player assumes the role of the hero of the film, Ashe Corven. It received negative reviews. Ojom GmbH released a j2me game called simply The Crow.\n\nThere have been five albums of music related to \"The Crow\" and its attendant films:\n\nThe Crow is an out-of-print collectible card game by Heartbreaker Press and Target Games. It is based on The Crow comics by James O'Barr and depicted images from the movie. It was released in November 1995 but initially had a release date of March 1995. It was one of three sets released by Heartbreaker Press and Target Games in November along with James Bond 007 and Kult. The game did not have starter decks, and instead it had a core set with 122 cards that included 10 foils that had artwork from the comic. The game was sold in booster packs of 15 cards, but no starter packs were available. A promo card called \"The Confident Crow\" was available by mail through proof-of-purchase order. An expansion titled \"Crow: City of Angels\" was announced for an October 1996 release but never materialized.\n\nPlayers control Angel, Devil, and Neutral Bystander cards and then send them into combat with \"opposing [P]ersonalities\". Action cards allow players to pump or hinder a Personality. Each Personality has an attack and defense value, as well as Virtue, which is equal to the highest value. Players play their Personality card and discard cards from their hands equal to the Virtue of the played card, and then they attack. If a player has a higher attack value than their opponent's defense value, the opponent is wounded. If a Personality would be wounded again, it is killed. A player wins by killing 25 Virtue worth of an opponent's Personalities.\n\nAndy Butcher reviewed \"The Crow\" for \"Arcane\" magazine, rating it a 6 out of 10 overall. Butcher comments that \"\"The Crow\" is a simple game that would serve as a good introduction to CCGs. There's just enough depth to give it some skill, and the game mechanics are elegant. Experienced players may find it limiting and lacking in lasting appeal.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

There they were raised to barons in 1588, counts in 1727 and princes (in primogeniture) in 1763. They were granted Opočno Castle in the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1634 and acquired numerous further estates in Bohemia and Austria. In 1945 they were expropriated and expelled from the Czechoslovak Republic, but returned after 1990 and received parts of their former estates restituted.\n\nThe Colloredo family is originally from Colloredo di Monte Albano, Italy, where they owned numerous estates. According to family tradition, it descends from the Swabian Lords of Waldsee. Allegedly, Liebhart (\"Liobardo\") of Waldsee came to Italy attending King Conrad II and about 1031 was enfeoffed by Patriarch Poppo of Aquileia with Mels Castle near Udine in Friuli. His descendants from 1309 onwards built Colloredo Castle as their residence. The Waldsee lineage however is disputed today.\n\nThe house was elevated to the noble rank of \"Freiherr\" by the Habsburg Emperor Rudolf II in 1588 and became \"Reichsgraf\" in 1724. In 1634 two Colloredo brothers were granted Opočno Castle in Bohemia by Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor. Rudolph Joseph von Colloredo (1706-1788), Vice-Chancellor of Empress Maria Theresa, was appointed Prince of the Holy Roman Empire in 1763.\n\nThe Colloredo-Mansfeld line emerged when his son Franz de Paula Gundakar von Colloredo married Princess Maria Isabella of Mansfeld in 1771 and was able to inherit her family's Bohemian estates with Dobříš Castle upon the extinction of the dynasty's male line in 1780, while the original Mansfeld possessions passed to the Prussian Duchy of Magdeburg. The union of the houses of Colloredo and Mansfeld was officially approved by decree of Emperor Joseph II in 1789; the decree used the spelling \"Colloredo-Mannsfeld\" whilst the spelling \"Colloredo-Mansfeld\" was more common.\n\nIn 1803 Prince Franz Gundakar purchased a part of the County of Rieneck from the House of Nostiz because its Imperial immediacy granted him a seat in the Imperial Diet, although he never moved there. In 1806 this territory was mediatised by the Archbishop of Regenburg, Karl Theodor von Dalberg, as part of his Principality of Aschaffenburg. In 1815 Rieneck was annexed by the Kingdom of Bavaria. The Prince purchased in 1804 a portion of the County of Limpurg known as the Lordship of Limpurg-Gröningen; this was mediatised by the Kingdom of Württemberg in 1806.\n\nIn the Second Czechoslovak Republic about half of the family possessions of 60,000 hectares of forests and farmland was expropriated during a land reform. Under German occupation (Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia), when the Colloredos who had become Czechoslovak citizens refused to become Germans, their remaining estates were confiscated by the Nazis and some of the nephews of prince Joseph II. (who lived in Paris) were arrested for slave work, others emigrated. After World War II, the family returned but only to face arrest and torture again, and subsequently expulsion from Czechoslovakia where they were again expropriated, this time \"as Germans\" under the Beneš decrees. They emigrated to Canada and the US. Their only remaining possession was Gstatt forest estate in Austria that they had purchased in 1929, while a younger branch still owns Sierndorf in Austria (purchased in 1756).\n\nParts of the Colloredo's possessions, among them Dobříš Castle and Zbiroh Castle and their farmlands, were restored by the Czech Republic to Jerome Colloredo-Mansfeld (who sold the latter and left the first to his nephew ). Opočno Castle was returned to prince Joseph III's daughter Kristina Colloredo-Mansfeld. A high court decision however forced her to give the castle back to the State while she was allowed to keep the farmland. A lawsuit over the arts collection at Opočno Castle is still pending. Countess Kristina is living in Opočno and in Gstatt, Austria. The family now owns again about 20,000 of their original 60,000 hectares.\n\n\n\n"}

She was born in China and came to Hong Kong at the age of twelve. She was a teacher and now a Hong Kong-based writer. Her works are popular in Taiwan and mainland China. She has become rather well known to secondary school age Hong Kong people these years likewise, though, not owing to her other specific masterpieces but, very likely, \"\"Shops\"\", one of her essays which is adopted as reading materials for the Chinese Language paper of Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination by the Hong Kong Examination Authority. The screenplay for the 2006 film, \"2 Become 1\" was based on her novel, \"\"Mourn Over the Breasts\"\"(哀悼乳房). The film starred Hong Kong Cantopop singer Miriam Yeung, as a woman living with breast cancer. In 2019, Xi Xi was the recipient of the Newman Prize for Chinese Literature. \n\nXi Xi's native county is Zhongshan, Guangdong. She was born in Shanghai, where she attended primary school, in 1938. In 1950, she immigrated to Hong Kong with her parents. Her father worked at Kowloon Motor Bus as a ticket checker. In addition, he had been a Division A soccer team trainer and, later, a referee since he was in Shanghai, thus Xi Xi had developed an immense interest in soccer when she was young. Xi Xi has two brothers and two sisters.\n\nLater, Xi Xi attended secondary school at Heep Yunn School, where lessons were taught in Cantonese; she started her English-instructed lessons from Form 4. During her early life in Hong Kong, Xi Xi was living in poverty, and she had to worry about her expenses on textbooks and her school uniform, as well as fees for Home Economics classes. As a junior secondary student, she began to write for the local newspapers and magazines.\n\nHer first piece, a fourteen-line modern Chinese poem, was published in \"\"Everyone's Literature\"\" (人人文學) in the 1950s. When Xi Xi was studying in Form 3, she won the first prize in the senior section of a writing competition organised by \"\"Learn-mates\"\" (學友) in which the chief editor was Wun Pik-lam (雲碧琳). In 1957, she continued her studies at the Grantham College of Education (later merged with other constitute colleges to form the Hong Kong Institute of Education), and became a teacher at a local governmental primary school after graduation. During her career as a teacher, she was an active member in the campaigns fighting for teachers' rights. Besides poetry, novel, essay, fairy tale and translated literature, Xi Xi attempted to write TV screenplay in the 1960s, like \"\"The Dark Green Age\"\" (黛綠年華) and \"\"The Window\"\" (窗), and numerous movie critics as well, in a refreshing yet vivid style. She was one of the pioneers in the field of experimental films in Hong Kong.\n\nLater, Xi Xi concentrated on the production of novels, as well as columns in various newspapers and magazines:\n\nMoreover, she had been the editor of \"\"Chinese Students' Weekly\"\" poetry section (1960s), as well as of \"\"Thumb Weekly\"\" (大拇指周報) (1975–1977) and \"\"Plain Leaf Literature\"\" (素葉文學) (1981–1984), which were founded by Xi Xi and her friends in 1978. Plain Leaf was a non-profit publisher, with its solemn, high-standard, and non-commercial local publication, which was actually rare in the book market of Hong Kong. Up to 1984, The publishing company had produced books of 22 categories, including \"\"A Loafer Who Burnt His Guitar\"\" (焚琴的浪子), a collection of Ma Lang's (馬朗) poems; \"\"A Tour in Mirrors\"\" (《鏡遊》), a Chinese movie critics collection by Lin Nian-tong (林年同); and \"\"My Resplendence\"\" (我的燦爛), a Zhong Ling-ling's (鍾玲玲) essay and poem collection. Along with different series of readers, Plain Leaf had also published a magazine called \"\"Plain Leaf Literature\"\" for 25 volumes. The publishing company closed down eventually due to a lack of funds, but it re-opened in the 1990s, and Plain Leaf is still in business these days.\n\nIn 1979, the number of teachers was over-supplied, and the Education Department promoted an early retirement scheme. Xi Xi tendered her resignation, and subsequently paid more heed to studies and creative writing. However, Hong Kong had fluctuated drastically in social aspects in the 1980s, and the demand for teacher had been skyrocketing. Xi Xi was occasionally invited by her ex-colleagues and worked as a contracted teacher for a year, or even a substitute teacher. In fact, she did not cease her teaching career entirely.\n\n\"Shops\" is an essay written by Xi Xi, which has been adopted as reading materials for the Chinese language paper of the HKCEE. This passage illustrates the ageing buildings, squatters, and old-fashioned traditional shops in Central and Western District, particularly in Sheung Wan and Sai Ying Pun, as well as other human behaviour in this hustling district. She expressed her tinge of nostalgia of her childhood, and of the disappearing old shops due to drastic infrastructural development.\n\nXi Xi enjoyed travelling, and she had been to Eastern Europe, Turkey, Egypt, Greece, and, most frequently, mainland China. These places had given much inspiration to her writing. In 1983, \"\"United Daily News\"\" re-published Xi Xi's \"\"A Lady Like Me\"\" (《像我這樣的一個女子》) from \"\"Plain Leaf Literature\"\", and it was the first time her works were known to Taiwan people. And that passage won Xi Xi the Recommended Novella Prize, the highest prize in the United Daily News 8th Novel Prize. In 2017, In 2016, a collection of poems by Xi Xi was published in English under the title \"Not Written Words\". In 2018, Xi Xi was the recipient of the Newman Prize for Chinese Literature. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1958069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958069", "title": "National Bank Cup", "text": "National Bank Cup\n\nThe National Bank Cup was the pre-eminent national netball competition in New Zealand between 1998 and 2007. From 2008, it was replaced by the ANZ Championship.\n\nIn the rounds, each team played every other team once, then the top four teams played off for the cup using the Page-McIntyre system.\n\n\nFranchise Setup\n\nOriginally called the Coca-Cola Cup from 1998, the competition promised to enhance netball's profile in New Zealand. Nine franchises were announced by Netball New Zealand in late 1997. The new teams included the Southern Sting – a side based in Invercargill that included star Silver Ferns Donna Loffhagen and Bernice Mene. Otago's Rebels fielded an impressive line-up that included former, current and future Silver Ferns Jo Morrison, Belinda Colling, Adine Harper, Anna Rowberry and Belinda Charteris. Further north in Auckland, their city was represented by three teams. The CMTV Cometz featured the best from South Auckland, the Diamonds represented Central Auckland and the highly fancied Northern Force were based from the North Shore. In Christchurch, the city welcomed to the sporting scene the Canterbury Flames. A province with proud netball links, the Flames were made up of the talented netballers in the Canterbury region.\n\n1998-2001\n\nThe 1998 season started with the Otago Rebels named outright favourites to take the inaugural season. With six current, former or future Silver Ferns in their ranks, they came through season 1998 undefeated. The Invercargill-based Southern Sting were the surprise package during 1998. With two Silver Ferns at each end of the court, the Sting surprised all making their way to the grand final in Dunedin, going down to the Rebels 57-50. The Auckland Diamonds, along with the Canterbury Flames reached the top four. Flames were eliminated from the semi's in a game from Invercargill where they went down by a single goal. The Waikato Wildcats and Bay of Plenty Magic suffered large losses throughout the season and joined forces in 1999 to create the Waikato/BOP Magic.\nThe 1999 season promised to be just as exciting as the Coca-Cola Cup's inaugural season. Like in 1998, the two southern sides Sting and Rebels came into the competition as the strongest. The Rebels retained their talented line-up of Silver Ferns, while Sting added to their roster, picking up English international Naomi Siddall as the teams import. The Auckland Diamonds also came into the season as a threat, along with their northern rivals the Force. \nAfter nine rounds of the competition, the semi-finals began. The Sting fought off the Northern Force in Invercargill 61-44, while the Rebels were also victorious. The Sting and Rebels met in the final for the second year in a row, but this time it was the Sting who celebrated by taking the title 63-54.\n\nAfter the Rebels taking the 1998 title, and the Sting 1999, the competitions North Island teams fought hard in season 2000. The Auckland Diamonds recruited smartly. Jamaican star Elaine Davis was picked up as their marquee signing. The Northern Force fielded as strong side also that included Tania Dalton, Temepara George and Linda Vangana. The two Auckland sides though, the Diamonds and Force failed to take the title, Diamonds finishing 6th and the Force reaching the semi-finals stage. In Wellington, the Capital Shakers landed South African Irene van Dyk. The 1.90m shooter helped the franchise on attack, but was unable to steer the team to the title. In the end, after three months of competition, the Sting took the title once again. After signing Lesley Nicol from the Rebels and retaining Silver Ferns Donna Loffhagen and Bernice Mene, the Sting were unstoppable. Winning back to back in front of their home fans in Invercargill, they defeated the Canterbury Flames 43-40 in the final, in front of a capacity crowd of 4300.\n\nSeason 2001 had the Sting aiming for three years in a row. The Invercargill-based franchise recruited well, retaining its stars and adding another to the roster, in Adine Harper. The Canterbury Flames plotted a plan to take the cup as well. Finalists in 2000, the Flames welcomed Leigh Gibbs to the coaching bench and assembled a strong team that included Silver Ferns Angela Mitchell, Belinda Colling, Julie Seymour, Belinda Charteris and Vili Davu. The Capital Shakers made their second semi-finals appearance, but again like in season 2000, were unable to progress, beaten by eventual champions the Southern Sting. The Sting made it three from four seasons defeating the Flames again for the second consecutive year in the final from Invercargill.\n\n2002-2004\nThe Southern Sting continued their dominance of the National Bank Cup, and would go on to win the competition again in 2002, 03 and 04. The Sting retained their core group of Donna Loffhagen, Lesley Rumball and Adine Harper, but lost the services of inspirational captain Bernice Mene – who retired after the 2002 season. The Invercargill-based franchise wasted no time to replace her, bringing in former Silver Fern and Canterbury Flames defender Anna Galvan. The Sting's defeat over the Flames in the 2004 final 63-55 would be their last title for some time.\n\nThe Flames would again fail to take the title, making the finals again in both 2002 and 2004. The Christchurch team showed promise on attack with the Silver Fern shooting pair of Jodi Te Huna and Belinda Colling impressive throughout the 2003 and 2004 seasons. Vili Davu and captain Julie Seymour were the glue through the defence end and midcourt respectively.\n\nThe Wellington Shakers made the finals in 2002, but struggled from 2003 – due to the departure of star Silver Fern Irene van Dyk. van Dyk shocked officials in Wellington with the announcement that she would join the Waikato/BOP Magic. The Shakers never found their way back to the semi finals, struggling on attack and fielding a mostly inexperienced line-up.\n\nIn Auckland, the Northern Force made their first National Bank Cup final in 2003. With Daneka Wipiiti, Teresa Tairi, Temepara George, Sheryl Scanlan and Linda Vangana on board, the Force fielded the strongest line-up on paper. But they would fail to defeat the Sting at home in the 2003 final, going down by two goals, 51-49. The Force would make the semi final again in 2004, but were beaten by the Flames on the North Shore. \nThe Force's rivals the Auckland Diamonds feared no better. 5th place getters in 2004, the Diamonds missed out on the chance to become the North Islands first winner. Anna Rowberry was impressive from the midcourt, but the team struggled to win when it counted – including a crucial loss to the Flames in regular play that confirmed their fate.\n\nThe Waikato/BOP Magic were estatic with the off season signing of Irene van Dyk for 2003, and the team's fortunes turned from there. Semi finalists in 2003 and 2004, although failing to go all the way, Magic showed promise for the future. Van Dyk worked well in combination with GA Anna Senio and midcourters Laura Langman and Amigene Metcalfe.\n\n2005-2006\n\nChampions changed for the 2005 and 2006 seasons with the Waikato/BOP Magic shocking all by defeating the Southern Sting, to take the title. The Magic, led by Silver Ferns Irene van Dyk, Laura Langman, Joline Henry and Casey Williams made history by becoming the first North Island team to win in 2005, with a 65-39 smashing over the former champions Southern Sting. They backed things up in 2006 by re-gaining the title at home in Hamilton with another large victory.\n\nThe Canterbury Flames drifted down the pecking order in the final three seasons, struggling to make the finals – the Flames finishing a poor 5th in 2005. The Christchurch-based side was over taken by the Auckland Diamonds – as one of the 'big four teams', after the signings of several top class players. The Diamonds signed Silver Ferns shooter Jodi Brown in 2005, along with former English international Jo Morrison, to complement their four other international players.\n\nThe Northern Force failed to perform with their talented roster, while the Capital Shakers and Western Flyers continued to struggle as the competitions cellar dwellers.\n\n2007\n2007 was dubbed the final season of The National Bank Cup. The Southern Sting were fitting winners of the competition for the final time, defeating the Northern Force in the grand final from Auckland, 50-49. Sting coach Robyn Broughton featured in her 100th game, as the Sting ran winners. The franchise had secured the services of Silver Fern squad members Daneka Wipiiti and Liana Barrett-Chase in the off season, after the loss of Tania Dalton to retirement. The duo join Southern Sting veterans Donna Wilkins, Adine Wilson, Megan Hutton and Jenny Ferguson.\n\nThe Otago Rebels looked to make an improvement for 2007. They picked up the signature of Silver Fern Jodi Brown from the Auckland Diamonds, while added Australian Demelza McCloud to their backline. The Rebels though, finished a disappointing 6th. Their northern rivals Canterbury Flames feared no better, finishing 5th.\n\nIn the North Island, the defending champions Waikato/BOP Magic made the semi final stage, but were defeated by two goals by the Sting in Invercargill. While the Northern Force hosted the grand final for the first time. Boasting a line-up full of Silver Ferns, they could not make it a tenth time lucky – going down to the Sting, 50-49.\n\nThe Sting celebrated a week later in Invercargill with a ticker tape parade, where mayor Tim Shadbolt congratulated the team on their success throughout the ten-year competition.\n\nThe eight franchises later amalgamated into five ANZ Championship teams for the 2008 trans-Tasman season. The Southern Sting and Otago Rebels joined forces to create the Southern Steel, while the Canterbury Flames re-branded as the Tactix. In Wellington, the Capital Shakers and the Flyers formed the Central Pulse, the Magic remained the status quo, while the Auckland Diamonds and Force welcomed the Mystics.\n\n\n"}

It was offered as a four-door saloon, five-door estate, and as a three-door van body derivative.\n\nDuring the mid 1970s, the motoring press speculated that a new Peugeot would soon arrive, in order to update the company's model lineup, in an attempt to make the Peugeot more internationally appealing. Since Peugeot had only recently discontinued their long-running 404 model, many people thought that the purpose of the new car would to fill the gap, previously occupied by the 404, between the 304 and 504 models, to compete against cars like the Ford Cortina/Taunus and Renault 12. It therefore would have been natural for the new car to be called the 405, commencing a new \"05\" generation of Peugeot models. The car was to be developed from and use the running gear from the smaller 304, but in terms of size and price, it was to succeed the already-defunct 404, especially considering that the top model in the new range would cost more than the entry-level 504, and that the 304 would remain in production some time after the new car was introduced. Instead of being called the 405, the new car was called the 305. When it made its press début in November 1977, the motoring press were initially confused as to why it was called a 305 rather than a 405, but it sold well anyway.\n\nIt was similar in size to its French competitor the Renault 18, which was launched around the same time. Sitting somewhere between the C- and D-segments it competed with cars in the Golf-class but also with somewhat larger cars like the Ford Cortina/Taunus, Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Ascona and Simca 1307/Chrysler Alpine.\n\nThe Peugeot 305 was unveiled in November 1977, and was initially available as a four-door saloon with a choice of two petrol engines: a 1290 cc, unit for the GL and GR models or a 1472 cc, for the top-specification SR model. Four months later Peugeot announced the 305 GRD, discreetly identified from the outside by the letters \"GRD\" on the left side of the boot/trunk lid, and powered by a 1548 cc diesel unit incorporating an aluminium engine block with an overhead camshaft along with a Bosch injector pump, and offering up to of power.\n\nAt Paris 1980, the sportier 305 S with twin carburettors and was introduced. After the 1982 facelift, the top model became the GTX, with . The 305 was the first of the \"05\" generation of Peugeots, a generation which survived until the end of 605 production in 1999.\n\nDespite the performance limitations of the smaller engine, the gearbox in all 305s was excellent, with extremely precise and light gear changes. The 305 combined a front-wheel-drive car with an excellent and durable gearbox. On the downside, there was no fifth gear provided but, especially at motorway speeds, the four gears gave the 305 the maximum power it needed in fourth. Peugeot was reported to have said that the car had no difficulty reaching if pushed to the limit.\n\nPower came from 1.3 litre or 1.5 litre petrol and 1.55 litre diesel engines and later, after the facelift, the 1.5 litre was replaced by a 1.6 litre and a Peugeot 1.9 petrol and XUD diesel engine were added. These were the same as used in the Talbot Horizon, a model acquired in 1979 when Peugeot took over Chrysler's European division and rebranded it as Talbot.\n\nThe facelifted 'series 2' models arrived at the Paris Salon in late 1982, to keep the 305 competitive with newer designs like the Ford Sierra and the new version of the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Ascona. They had revised frontal styling, new improved front suspension and steering, a new dashboard and a modified under bonnet and subframe layout to allow the new generation of XU series engines with 5-speed gearbox to be fitted. Thus switching from the Mini type in-sump gearbox arrangement used also in the 204 and 304 to the now-universal end-on gearbox configuration (pioneered by Fiat in the 1960s Autobianchi Primula), of front-wheel drive with a transverse engine and a gearbox on the end of the engine and unequal-length drive shafts. However, the GL / GR and van models continued to use the earlier XL/XR series engines with four-speed gearbox for a few more years.\n\nSales of the 305 were strong in France and most other countries where the car was sold, In Britain, its original competitors were the Ford Cortina MK4, Vauxhall Cavalier MK1 and Morris Marina. It was launched around the same time as its key French rival, the Renault 18. Later in its production life, it was competing with newer rivals including the Ford Sierra, MK2 Vauxhall Cavalier, Austin Montego, Renault 21 and the British-built Nissan Bluebird.\n\nIn 1979, the 305 won 1979 the \"What Car?\" \"Car of the Year\" in the United Kingdom, although it was largely overlooked by the motoring press for that year's European Car of the Year award, who voted the Chrysler/Simca Horizon as the winner, the Fiat Ritmo/Strada in second place and the Audi 80 in third place. \n\nProduction of saloons ceased in 1988, following the launch of the slightly larger and more powerful Peugeot 405, which was a much stronger seller in the United Kingdom. Production of 305 estates and vans ceased in 1989 and didn't see a replacement until the launch of the 306 estate in 1997. The diesel engine fitted to the phase 2 305 was capable of over 50 mpg (Imp). The engine at the time was regarded as the best diesel around where most other engines notably those from Volkswagen and British Leyland sounded agricultural in comparison.\n\nAlthough it was a reasonably common sight on Britain's roads throughout the 1980s and until well into the 1990s, just 76 examples of the 305 were reported to be on Britain's roads by February 2016.\n\nThe body was done by Italian stylist Pininfarina and was completely new. It was all-steel monocoque which strongly resembled the BMW 3 Series of the time. The design is based on Peugeot's 'VSS' prototype safety vehicle, which Peugeot created to improve car safety. This meant that the car had front and rear crumple zones, side impact protection, a protected fuel tank and bolt-on front wings. Three bodystyles were available, consisting of a conventional three-box four-door sedan, a five-door station wagon, and a three-door panel van.\n\nA series of aerodynamic research studies called VERA (\"Véhicule Économe de Recherche Appliquée\", \"applied research in economical vehicles\") was also begun in 1981. The first model was a petrol-engined version (VERA 01) with a engine, topping out at . The cars were significantly lightened; the VERA 02 went from and made more aerodynamic. A large rear wing, skirts covering parts of the rear wheels, and deeply scalloped sections behind the front wheels were all noticeable. The Cx was reduced from 0.44 to 0.319, helping lower fuel consumption between 33 and 38 percent. At the 1982 Geneva Salon the VERA 02, with a 1362 cc turbodiesel, was shown, and the more radical VERA Plus followed later in 1982 - this was no more than a thinly veiled Peugeot 309 prototype.\n\nThe 305 estate marked the debut of the now standard PSA Peugeot Citroën rear suspension layout. This is fully independent using trailing arms. It is very compact and was designed to minimise suspension intrusion into the wide flat loadspace, while providing excellent ride and handling. This was later developed (in other Peugeots) to use torsion bars instead of the 305's horizontal coil springs, and it was a key ingredient of the success of the Peugeot 205. The torsion bars system was very similar to those used by Renault and Simca for many years previously.\n\nhttp://planete305.fr\n"}

Such claims are not recognized by any authority, and have no legal standing. Nevertheless, some private individuals and organizations have claimed ownership of celestial bodies, such as the Moon, and are actively involved in \"selling\" parts of them through certificates of ownership termed \"Lunar deeds\", \"Martian deeds\" or similar.\n\nThe topic of real estate on celestial objects has been present since the 1890s. Dean Lindsay made claims for all extraterrestrial objects on June 15, 1936. The public sent offers to buy objects from him as well.\n\nThe United Nations sponsored 1967 \"Outer Space Treaty\" established all of outer space as an international commons by describing it as the \"province of all mankind\" and forbidding all the nations from claiming territorial sovereignty. Article VI vests the responsibility for activities in space to States Parties, regardless of whether they are carried out by governments or non-governmental entities. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 had been ratified by 102 countries by 2013, including all the major space-faring nations. It has also been signed but not yet ratified by 26 other nations.\n\nA subsequent treaty document, the international Moon Treaty—finalised in 1979 (just five countries had ratified it by 1984, but five countries was sufficient for it to be considered officially \"in force\")—went further and forbade private ownership of extraterrestrial real estate. This agreement has not been widely ratified. with only 18 countries having ratified it by 2018.\n\nSeveral individuals and private organizations claimed ownership of the moon and other extraterrestrial bodies, but no such claims have yet been recognized. A white paper by the Competitive Enterprise Institute suggested legislation whereby the US would recognize claims made by private entities, American and others, which meet certain conditions regarding habitation and transportation.\n\nA number of individuals and organizations offer schemes or plans claiming to allow people to purchase portions of the Moon or other celestial bodies. Though the details of some of the schemes' legal arguments vary, one goes so far as to state that although the Outer Space Treaty, which entered force in 1967, forbids countries from claiming celestial bodies, there is no such provision forbidding private individuals from doing so. However, Article VI of this treaty states \"The activities of non-governmental entities in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate State Party to the Treaty.\" Thus, while it does not explicitly prohibit such schemes, the treaty does require they be authorized by the schemers' government.\n\nThe short story \"The Man Who Sold the Moon\" by Robert A. Heinlein, which was written in 1949, offers a portrayal regarding such plans or schemes, and created the concept of a Lunar Republic. Heinlein's \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" also makes reference to a space law case called the \"Larkin Decision\".\n\nA space ownership issue of current practical importance is the allocation of slots for satellites in geostationary orbit. This is managed by the International Telecommunication Union. The 1976 Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries, also known as the Bogotá Declaration, signed by several countries located on the Earth's equator, attempted to assert sovereignty over those portions of the geostationary orbit that continuously lie over the signatory nation's territory. These claims did not receive wider international support or recognition and were subsequently largely abandoned.\n\nChilean lawyer Jenaro Gajardo Vera became famous for his 1953 claim of ownership of the Moon.\n\nMartin Juergens from Germany claims that the Moon has belonged to his family since July 15, 1756, when the Prussian king Frederick the Great presented it to his ancestor Aul Juergens as a symbolic gesture of gratitude for services rendered, and decreed that it should pass to the youngest born son.\n\nA. Dean Lindsay made claims for all extraterrestrial objects on June 15, 1936, and sent a letter to Pittsburgh Notary Public along with a deed and money for establishment of the property. The public sent offers to buy objects from him as well. He had previously made claims on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\n\nJames T. Mangan (1896–1970) was a famous eccentric, public relations man and best-selling author on self-help topics who publicly claimed ownership of outer space in 1948. Mangan founded what he called the \"Nation of Celestial Space\" and registered it with the Recorder of Deeds and Titles of Cook County, Illinois, on January 1, 1949.\n\nRobert R. Coles, former chairman of New York's Hayden Planetarium, started \"the interplanetary Development Corporation\" and sold lots on the moon for one dollar per acre ($2.50/ha).\n\nDennis Hope, an American entrepreneur, sells extraterrestrial real estate. In 1980, he started his own business, the Lunar Embassy Commission. As of 2009 Hope claimed to have sold 2.5M plots on the Moon, for around US$20 per acre ($50/ha). He allocates land to be sold by closing his eyes and randomly pointing to a map of the Moon. He claims two former US presidents as customers, stating Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan had aides purchase the plots on the moon.\n\nIn 1997, Adam Ismail, Mustafa Khalil and Abdullah al-Umari, three men from Yemen, sued NASA for invading Mars. They claim that they \"inherited the planet from our ancestors 3,000 years ago\", before the Islamic prophet Muhammad. They based their argument on mythologies of the Himyaritic and Sabaean civilizations that existed several thousand years B.C.\n\nGregory W. Nemitz claimed ownership of Asteroid 433 Eros, on which NEAR Shoemaker landed in 2001. His company, called \"Orbital Development\", issued NASA an invoice of $20 for parking the spacecraft at the asteroid. NASA declined to pay, citing the lack of legal standing.\n\nRichard Garriott, computer game designer and astronaut's son, legitimately purchased the Lunokhod 2 lunar lander from the Russian Space Agency. Since then he jokingly claimed the rest of the Moon in the name of his gaming character, Lord British.\n\n\n"}

It serves Canterbury-Bankstown and parts of the Inner West and Western Sydney. The Bankstown railway line is the physical railway line which carries the section of the Bankstown Line between Sydenham and Birrong.\n\nThe Bankstown railway line opened between Sydenham on the Illawarra railway line and Belmore in 1895. This was the second solely suburban line to open in Sydney, following the North Shore railway line in 1890–all other rail lines were mainlines carrying traffic into and out of Sydney. In 1909, the line was extended to Bankstown, with intermediate stations at Lakemba and Punchbowl. In 1916, the Metropolitan Goods Line was constructed, running parallel to the Bankstown Line between Marrickville and Campsie. A second extension, from Bankstown to Birrong, opened in 1928. This provided connections to the main suburban railway at Lidcombe and the main south line to Liverpool. A new station between Lakemba and Punchbowl at Wiley Park opened in 1938.\n\nIn 1926 the Bankstown Line became the second line in Sydney to be electrified and a maintenance depot was constructed at Punchbowl. Electrification was extended from Bankstown to Regents Park in 1939. The Punchbowl Maintenance Depot closed in 1994.\n\nIn January 2006 a four-year project to upgrade the line was completed. The work included the resleepering of the entire line, replacing the former wooden sleepers with the more durable concrete ones, replacement and upgrade of the signalling, and also replacement of the ageing catenary, mostly with the more modern double contact wire variety. The lengthy upgrade process was noted for its \"January Closedowns\", in which the entire line was closed in January for the bulk of the upgrade work to take place.\n\nElectric passenger services operated along the Bankstown Line to Wynyard station until the 1956 opening of Circular Quay station and the completion of the City Circle. In 1979 with the opening of the Eastern Suburbs line the direction around the City Circle reversed with trips from Bankstown going to St James first and vice versa.\n\nOperation of the Bankstown Line had been tied to the operation of all stations services on the Main Suburban railway line between Lidcombe and the City (marketed as the Inner West Line). Services consisted of a mixture of \"Bankstown loop\" trains (City - Sydenham - Bankstown - Lidcombe - Strathfield - City) and trains from both sides of the loop (Birrong or Regents Park) heading to Sefton and then further west. Until the early 2000s, a number of Bankstown trains continued via the Western Line to Blacktown via Granville and Parramatta.\n\nA new timetable released in October 2013 broke the loop between the two lines. As part of the Rail Clearways Program, new turnbacks were constructed at Lidcombe and Homebush to allow the separation of both lines and increase their reliability and frequency. Services were also changed to operate mostly around the City Circle via Town Hall on weekdays (rather than via Museum). As part of the timetable change, a new numbering system was also introduced and the line was given the number T3. A sextuplication project between Erskinevile and Sydenham was also proposed as part of the Rail Clearways Program, but was cancelled in 2011. It was intended to separate Bankstown line services from those operating towards East Hills. The 2013 timetable sees most East Hills line trains using the Airport line to access the city.\n\nThe line was depicted in a brown colour in the early 1990s before being changed to a purple colour around 2000, before it became the current orange colour.\n\nSydney Metro City & Southwest is a plan to convert the Sydenham to Bankstown section of the line to use single deck metro trains. A new tunnel will be constructed between Sydenham and Chatswood, for access to the city. The stations at St Peters, Erskineville and the Bankstown to Liverpool / Lidcombe sections of the line will not be served by the metro; customers from stations west of Bankstown will be required to interchange at Lidcombe / Bankstown / Cabramatta.\n\nThe Bankstown line begins at Sydenham railway station on the Illawarra line. The line branches at Sydenham Junction and passes in a westwards direction to Bankstown, where it heads north to Birrong. Between Marrickville and Campsie, the Metropolitan Goods line runs in parallel. At Birrong, the line meets the Main South Line which runs from Lidcombe to Cabramatta via Regents Park.\n\nPassenger services begin at Town Hall station on the City Circle. Most services operate around the City Circle in a clockwise direction to Central, then through Redfern. However both inbound and outbound trains can also travel in the counterclockwise direction around the City Circle, as of the November 2017 timetable. Trains usually operate on the 'Illawarra local' (western pair) tracks between Redfern and Sydenham, serving St Peters and Erskineville stations. Just north of Sydenham, all trains take the turnout onto the 'Bankstown' tracks. At Sefton Park Junction (west of Birrong), about half of the Bankstown line trains continue north to Lidcombe. The other half goes west to Liverpool.\n\nThe line serves two major centres in Western Sydney, namely Bankstown and Liverpool.\n\nThe following table shows the patronage of Sydney Trains network for the year ending 30 June 2019.\n\n"}

The final issue, No. 6, described a journey from a punk squat in London to Stonehenge Free Festival. Groups featured in KYPP were Adam and the Ants, Crass, Bauhaus, Southern Death Cult, The Mob, The Associates, Charge, Sex Gang Children and the Cuddly Toys.\n\nKYPP was written and designed in 'anarcho-situationist style' by a fluctuating group of around 12 members of the Puppy Collective. Influences on KYPP ranged from sixties undergrounds magazines like \"OZ\" and \"International Times\", to Wilhelm Reich, the Angry Brigade, Aleister Crowley, surrealism, eco-feminism and David Bowie. \n\nThe Puppy Collective were also variously active participants in events and situations of the period - including a Sid Vicious Memorial March in 1979, the Wapping Autonomy Centre in 1981/2, Centro Iberico Anarchist Centre 1982, the 1982 Stonehenge to Greenham Peace Convoy and the 1983 Stop the City protest and the 1982/3/4 Stonehenge Free festivals.\n\n"}

During the catalytic cycle, a reversible interconversion of the oxidized (FMN), semiquinone (FMNH), and reduced (FMNH) forms occurs in the various oxidoreductases. FMN is a stronger oxidizing agent than NAD and is particularly useful because it can take part in both one- and two-electron transfers. In its role as blue-light photo receptor, (oxidized) FMN stands out from the 'conventional' photo receptors as the signaling state and not an E/Z isomerization.\n\nIt is the principal form in which riboflavin is found in cells and tissues. It requires more energy to produce, but is more soluble than riboflavin.\n\nFlavin mononucleotide is also used as an orange-red food colour additive, designated in Europe as E number E101a.\n\nE106, a very closely related food dye, is riboflavin-5′-phosphate sodium salt, which consists mainly of the monosodium salt of the 5′-monophosphate ester of riboflavin.

It is on the Calder Highway between Mildura and the Murray River crossing at the Abbotsford Bridge to Curlwaa. At the , the town had a population of 1,981. Merbein is 12 kilometres from Mildura, 553 km from Melbourne and 389 km from Adelaide.\n\nThe town is known for farming and is part what is informally called the \"fruit bowl\" or \"food bowl\", the growing region roughly made of the Coomealla and Sunraysia irrigation districts fed by the Darling and Murray rivers. Produce farmed in Merbein include grapes, citrus, mushrooms, green beans, asparagus and pistachios.\n\nMerbein is also home of Mildara Wines, a winery W B Chaffey had built in 1913 for the first intake of grapes in 1914. The winery, originally known as the Mildura Distillery and Winery, stands on a 30-metre sandstone cliff near Pump Hill. The Chalmers family established its Murray Darling vineyard in Merbein, in 2010.\n\nMerbein is the most northern Victorian town and celebrated 100 years as an irrigation settlement in 2009. The Merbein irrigation settlement, originally known as White Cliffs for its river cliffs, was established on a pastoral holding in 1909. It was one of the first state-owned pumped irrigation settlements in Victoria. A Rotary Club of Merbein sign states: \"Irrigation commenced in 1910 originally for pasture and grain crops, but quickly assumed its present economy of vineyard and orchard culture.\" \nThe settlement was originally known as White Cliffs because of its river white cliffs. It was intended to be renamed \"Merebin\", reputedly an Aboriginal name of a local sandhill, but it was mistakenly registered as \"Merbein\" instead.\n\nThe post office opened on 16 August 1909. In 1912 the irrigation settlement's name was officially changed to Merbein.\n\nE.J. Kenny was the first Officer in Charge of the State Rivers & Water Supply Commission of Victoria Irrigation Area established in 1909. The hot climate and the distance from markets saw the settlement quickly change from dairying to the growing of the less perishable crops of citrus and grapes for drying and spirit making.\n\nSoldier settlement blocks were established in Birdwoodton and Merbein West during and after WW1 and many streets were named after local soldiers who died in WW1. The district's horticulture and viticultural industries also attracted many European immigrants to the area.\n\nKenny, known as the 'Father of Merbein' , died suddenly in 1925 and his contribution to the success of the settlement was acknowledged with the naming of Kenny Park. Today, Merbein continues to be an irrigation district, diversifying from the growing of dried grapes and citrus to a wide variety of wine and table grapes, asparagus, almonds, mushrooms and vegetables. As well as a wine bottling and packaging industry and a vegetable juicing facility, Merbein has also developed as a regional transport hub for the export of district products.\n\nThe town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Sunraysia Football League.\n\nSporting clubs include the Merbein Football and Netball Club (Magpies) based at Kenny Park, the Merbein South Cricket Club and Saints Baseball Club both based at Chaffey Park, as well as the Merbein Cobras Basketball club. Merbein also has recreational and sporting facilities such as football, cricket and soccer grounds, a swimming pool, lawn bowling and croquet greens, tennis and netball courts, a golf club and formed walking tracks at the Merbein Common.\nOther sporting groups are located in the area including tennis, swimming, Tae Kwon Do, and soccer.\n\nGolfers play at the Merbein Golf Club course on McEdward Street.\n\nStudents from Prep through to year 10 attend Merbein P-10 College. The school underwent improvements after it was converted in 2013 from a High school (years 7 to year 10), into a Prep to year 10. Prior to the redevelopment there were three small primary school campuses, located at Merbein, Merbein West, Merbein South. These sites have since been abandoned, and all students are located at the previous Merbein Secondary College Campus.\n\nMerbein previously held the Great Australian Vanilla Slice Triumph from 2011–2016, but since 2017 its home has been Mildura's Langtree mall after Mildura City Heart took over with the help from Mildura Rural City Council. It was hosted in Ouyen for 14 years previously.\n\nIn September, Merbein holds the Merbein Community Rodeo at Kenny Park.\n\n\n\n"}

It phosphorylates a number of biologically important targets and is implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle relaxation, platelet function, sperm metabolism, cell division, and nucleic acid synthesis.\n\nPKG are serine/threonine kinases that are present in a variety of eukaryotes ranging from the unicellular organism \"Paramecium\" to humans. Two PKG genes, coding for PKG type I (PKG-I) and type II (PKG-II), have been identified in mammals. The N-terminus of PKG-I is encoded by two alternatively spliced exons that specify for the PKG-Iα and PKG-Iβ isoforms. PKG-Iβ is activated at ~10-fold higher cGMP concentrations than PKG-Iα. The PKG-I and PKG-II are homodimers of two identical subunits (~75 kDa and ~85 kDa, respectively) and share common structural features.\n\nEach subunit is composed of three functional domains:\n\n\nBinding of cGMP to the regulatory domain induces a conformational change which stops the inhibition of the catalytic core by the N-terminus and allows the phosphorylation of substrate proteins. Whereas PKG-I is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, PKG-II is anchored to the plasma membrane by N-terminal myristoylation.\n\nIn general, PKG-I and PKG-II are expressed in different cell types. \n\nSpecifically, in smooth muscle tissue, PKG promotes the opening of calcium-activated potassium channels, leading to cell hyperpolarization and relaxation, and blocks agonist activity of phospholipase C, reducing liberation of stored calcium ions by inositol triphosphate.\n\nCancerous colon cells stop producing PKG, which apparently limits beta-catenin thus allowing the VEGF enzyme to solicit angiogenesis.\n\nIn \"Drosophila melanogaster\" the foraging (\"for\") gene is a polymorphic trait that underlies differences in food-seeking behaviors. The \"for\" locus is made up of Rover (\"for\") and Sitter (\"for\") alleles, with the Rover allele being dominant. Rover individuals typically travel greater distances when foraging for food, while Sitter individuals travel less distance to forage for food. Both Rover and Sitter phenotypes are considered wild-type, as fruit fly populations typically exhibit a 70:30 Rover-to-Sitter ratio. The Rover and Sitter alleles are located within the 24A3-5 region of the \"Drosophila melanogaster\" polytene chromosome, a region which contains the PKG d2g gene. PKG expression levels account for differences in \"for\" and \"for\" allele frequency and therefore behavior as Rover individuals show higher PKG expression than Sitter individuals, and the Sitter phenotype can be converted to Rover by over-expression of the dg2 gene.\n\n\n"}

On its main thoroughfares, West Lombard Street, Hollins Street, West Baltimore Street and South Carey Streets, spacious three-story row houses predominate. Most are pre- and post-Civil War Italianate in style, but there are many examples of Early Victorian Greek Revival and Late Victorian Romanesque Revival . A majority of these homes have ten- to fourteen-foot ceilings, tall distinctive windows, wood floors, and plaster walls. Exteriors are brick and mortar facades with cornices and marble steps. On side streets and alley streets (which are common in Baltimore) a variety of two-story and two-story-with-attic rowhouses are found.\n\nAn uncommon synergy prevails in Sowebo as residents, both longtime and newly arrived, work together through various committees and forums to enhance the area's quality of life . An annual arts festival, called the Sowebohemian Arts Festival, is held in the streets around Hollins Market on the Sunday afternoon of the Memorial Day weekend.\n\nThe University of Maryland's BioPark is a recent addition, with portions still under construction.

It connects Schofields and Leppington stations in the western suburbs. Limited services extend from Schofields to Richmond. The line opened in 1996, following the construction of a 'Y-link' track between Harris Park and Merrylands stations. The intention of this link was to allow direct services to operate from the south west suburbs to Parramatta and Blacktown without requiring a change of trains at Granville. The line takes its name from the Cumberland Plain on which much of Western Sydney was built.\n\nUpon its opening in 1996, the line had a regular half-hourly service in each direction consisting of 38 journeys per day. Subsequent timetables saw its services significantly reduced to the point of running only during weekday peak hours, and from 2005 to 2013 the line only ran in one direction at a time: two services ran in the morning peak from Campbelltown towards Blacktown and three services ran in the opposite direction in the evening. Some services operated to or from Quakers Hill or Schofields on the Richmond line, but the line's official terminus on network maps and other material remained at Blacktown.\n\nPrior to the Y-Link's opening, passengers travelling between the Western and South lines were required to change trains at Granville. With the reduction in services to peak hours only, this travelling strategy was resumed by most commuters.\n\nIn 2006, the then-Iemma Labor Government's NSW State Plan committed to re-introduce a regular half-hourly service to the Cumberland line during 2007 \"subject to detailed timetable and train planning... and fleet delivery, availability and rostering\". A CityRail news release on 15 December confirmed this intention, based on the gradual introduction of the then-new OSCAR (H set) trains, which would displace outer suburban Tangara G sets; the latter trains then reassigned to suburban service. This promise was not delivered, and the Cumberland Line remained a peak-hour-only service with 4 car trains.\n\nDaytime half-hourly services were re-introduced on 21 October 2013. Services finished in the early evening and did not operate on weekends. At this time, the line was also officially extended to Schofields, where most northbound services terminated.\n\nAs part of a major timetable change for the Sydney Trains network on 26 November 2017, Cumberland Line services were modified to no longer travel to and from Campbelltown, instead starting and terminating at Leppington. Simultaneous changes to the Airport, Inner West & South Line saw that line split into the Inner West & Leppington Line and Airport & South Line. These changes mean the section of the network between Glenfield and Macarthur is served exclusively by services operating via the East Hills railway line. The changes also saw late night and weekend services introduced on the Cumberland Line. The late night services extend to Richmond, replacing T1 services at these times. On weekends, trains operate between Quakers Hill and Liverpool only with early morning and late night services extending to Leppington and Richmond.\n\nPhysically, the line consists of the Richmond railway line from Schofields/Richmond to Blacktown, the Main Western Line from Blacktown station to Harris Park, the 'Y-link' as described below, the \"Old Main South\" between Merrylands and Cabramatta, the Main South Line between Cabramatta and Glenfield, and the South West Rail Link between Edmondson Park and Leppington.\nDuring the week, the Cumberland Line usually has two services an hour in each direction between Schofields and Leppington. In the peak, the services usually only run till Blacktown due to other services. On the weekend, this line holds two services an hour in both directions between Quakers Hill and Liverpool. The line is usually service by 4 Car Milleniums, though sometimes being serviced by the new waratahs and the K Sets.\n\nThe 'Y-link' was opened in 1996 as part of former Prime Minister Paul Keating's 'Building Better Cities' programme in recognition of Parramatta's place as the capital of Sydney's west. It cost $80 million to construct, and required the construction of a little over one kilometre of new track and no new stations. This track consists of the creation of a triangular junction at the junction of the 'Old Main South' and the 'Main Western Line by laying track between Merrylands and Harris Park stations. The work included a new flyover of the 'Up Old Main South' over these new tracks.\nThe following table shows the patronage of Sydney Trains network for the year ending 30 June 2019.\n\n"}
{"id": "1958171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958171", "title": "Stage piano", "text": "Stage piano\n\nA stage piano is an electronic musical instrument designed for use in live performance on a stage or a studio, as well as for music recording in jazz and popular music. While stage pianos share some of the same features as digital pianos designed for home use and synthesizers, they have a number of features which set them apart. Stage pianos usually provide a smaller number of sounds (acoustic piano, electric piano, and Hammond organ), with these sounds being of higher quality, unlike regular digital pianos and home synthesizers. \n\nUnlike many digital pianos, which are designed for semi-permanent installation in a private home, and which have design elements which make regular transportation difficult (e.g., permanently mounted legs, modesty panel, internal power amplifier and speakers and a fixed sustain pedal), which would require a van and movers to relocate, a stage piano generally has a portable, detachable stand, no internal amp or speakers (an output jack is provided so the instrument can be plugged into a keyboard amplifier), and a detachable sustain pedal plugged into a jack. This enables a performer to remove all the detachable parts and makes it easier to transport the instrument to gigs and rehearsals.\n\nStage pianos usually have a smaller selection of sounds than digital electronic keyboards and synthesizers. Instead of the hundreds of sounds and complex oscillator controls available on a high-end, professional synthesizer, they often have a small number of sounds, typically a variety of acoustic piano, electric piano, and Hammond organ sounds. Also, instead of scrolling through the on-screen menus used on synthesizers, stage pianos are usually controlled with simple knobs and buttons. \n\nStage pianos differ from inexpensive home digital keyboards in a number of ways. Home digital keyboards provide several hundred sounds, ranging from imitation electric piano and flute sounds to buzzy synth-style sounds. However, the imitation sounds are created by relatively simple synthesis methods, rather than by sampling or complex Digital Signal Processing-modelling, as in the case of a high-end stage piano. This means that the sound quality of presets are not suitable for a professional performance.\n\nStage pianos often have a heavier, more robust body, which is better able to withstand the stress of heavy touring. Unlike digital pianos designed for home use, they do not have a fixed stand or fixed sustain pedals. Instead, they are designed to be used with a separate portable stand and portable, plug-in sustain pedals. This makes stage pianos easier to transport on tours.\n\nWhile almost all digital pianos and lower-end synthesizer keyboards designed for home use have small onboard powered speakers, stage pianos are often designed without onboard speakers; instead, they are designed to be used with external amplification. While small, low-powered amplified speakers may be appropriate for in-home use, they cannot provide sufficient power for on-stage monitoring in rock and jazz performance settings. While most onboard powered speakers produce between 6 and 40 watts per speaker, a typical professional keyboard amplifier will produce over 300 watts. Nevertheless, some stage pianos, such as the Yamaha P-250 or Casio Privia, do have onboard powered speakers.\n\nMost stage pianos provide a recreation of the electro-mechanical electric pianos that were based on picking up the sound of a metal tine, reed or string hit by a hammer, such as the Fender Rhodes, Wurlitzer 200A or Yamaha CP-70/CP-80 series. Instead of using tines or strings, stage pianos reproduce sound electronically by the use of sampled or digitally modelled sounds. They usually have MIDI interfaces to permit them to be used as master keyboards, which can control other tone-generating modules, such as Hammond organ-emulators or synthesizer string modules.\n\nMost digital stage pianos have weighted keys or semi-weighted keys. The difference is how much force it will take you to push on the keys and how much the keys feel like those of an acoustic piano.\nStage pianos usually have 88 keys, which is standard for all modern acoustic pianos. However, some stage pianos have fewer keys, such as the Kurzweil SP76. It has only 76 semi-weighted keys, but is still called a stage piano because of its layout and weighted keys.\n\nWhile the sounds or \"voices\" available on stage pianos is often wider than that of a digital piano designed for home use, stage pianos have far fewer voices than a typical electronic synthesizer. Stage pianos usually have a smaller selection of voices, typically acoustic piano, electric piano, Hammond organ, and a few others. Some stage pianos also provide a few basic synthesizer functions, to enable performers to play accompaniment \"pads\" or synth \"leads.\"\n\n"}

In 1937, he delivered the Turnbull lectures at Johns Hopkins University. These were later published under the title \"Reality and the Poet in Spanish Poetry.\"\n\nHe was born in lopera in the Calle de Toledo, 1891, in a house very close to the San Isidro church/cathedral. Salinas lived his early years in the heart of the city and went to school first in the \"Colegio Hispano-Francés\" and then in the \"Instituto Nacional de Segunda Enseñanza\", both close by the club. His father, a cloth-merchant, died in 1899. He began to study Law at the Universidad central in 1908 and in 1910 started to study History concurrently. He graduated successfully in both courses in 1913. During his undergraduate years, he began to write and publish poems in small circulation journals such as \"Prometeo\". \nIn 1914 he became the Spanish \"lector\" at the Collège de Sorbonne in the University of Paris until 1917, when he received his Doctorate. He had married Margarita Bonmarti, a Spanish girl of Algerian descent whom he had met on his summer holidays in Santa Pola, Alicante, in December 1915. She had been born in 1884. They had two children, Soledad (always referred to as Solita) born in 1920 and Jaime born in 1925. His academic life seemed to act as a model for his slightly younger contemporary Jorge Guillén with whom he struck up a friendship in 1920.\n\nIn 1918 he was appointed Professor of Spanish Language and Literature at the University of Seville and he held the post until 1928, although he spent 1922-23 as \"lector\" at the University of Cambridge. One of his students in Seville was Luis Cernuda in the academic year 1919-20, to whom he gave special encouragement. He urged him to read modern French literature, in particular André Gide and the poetry of Baudelaire, Mallarmé and Rimbaud. He continued to publish poems in magazines such as \"España\" and \"La Pluma\". In vacations, he spent time as a lecturer at the Residencia de Estudiantes, where he got to know the leading lights of his generation, such as García Lorca and Rafael Alberti. In April 1926, he was present at the gathering in Madrid where the first plans to celebrate the tercentenary of Góngora's death were laid. Salinas was to edit the volume devoted to the sonnets: a project that never came to fruition. While at Cambridge, his translation of the first two volumes and part of the third of Marcel Proust's \"In Search of Lost Time\" into Spanish was published. And in 1925, his modernised version of El Poema de Mío Cid was published by \"Revista de Occidente\".\n\nIn 1928 he became a researcher at the Centro de Estudios Históricos in Madrid before becoming director of studies for foreigners at the University of Madrid. In 1930, he became a professor of Spanish literature at Madrid and doubled up as originator, organiser and secretary-general of the International Summer School of Santander between 1933 and 1936. This school was set up to accommodate 200 Spanish students (approximately 4 from each of the established universities in Spain) and an international teaching staff.\n\nOn 8 March 1933, he was present at the premiere in Madrid of García Lorca's play \"Bodas de sangre\". In August 1933, he was able to host performances at the Magdalena Palace in Santander by the travelling theatre company \"La Barraca\" that Lorca led. On 20 April 1936, he attended the launch party in Madrid for Luis Cernuda's new collection \"La realidad y el deseo\". and on 12 July he was present at a party in Madrid that took place just before García Lorca departed to Granada for the last time before his murder. It was there that Lorca read his new play \"La casa de Bernarda Alba\" for the last time.\n\nOn 31 August 1936, shortly after the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, he moved to the USA, to take up the position of the Mary Whiton Calkins professor at Wellesley College, Mass., which he held until 1937. In the spring of 1937, he delivered a series of lectures as the Turnbull Professor at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, on Poet and Reality in Spanish Literature (published 1940). In the summer of that year (and in many subsequent years), he taught in the Spanish faculty of Middlebury College, Vermont and was awarded a doctorate \"honoris causa\". In May 1939, he participated in a PEN International conference in New York, representing the writers of the (Second) Spanish Republic.\n\nHe had been dividing his time between the faculties of Wellesley, Middlebury, and Johns Hopkins but in 1940 he took up a permanent post at Johns Hopkins where he remained for the rest of his life, including long spells of travel in South America and a period of 3 years at the University of Puerto Rico. In the summer of 1949 he returned to Europe for the last time to visit Italy and France and to work for UNESCO. At the beginning of 1951 he began to exhibit signs of ill-health, which turned out to be an incurable cancer. He died on 4 December 1951. At his request he was buried in Santa Maria Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in San Juan.\n\nSalinas was the father-in-law of Spanish historian and writer, Juan Marichal. Marichal would later publish Salinas' complete works, \"Three Voices of Pedro Salinas\", which was released in 1976. His daughter edited his poetry and incorporated an introduction by his old friend Jorge Guillén.\n\nHis poetry falls naturally into 3 periods: the first three books, the love poetry, and the poetry of exile. However, there are more continuities between these phases than such an analysis would suggest. In his published Johns Hopkins lectures he remarked: \n\nThere is a crucial difference between the world of everyday appearance and the deeper reality that the poet sees and tries to convey to his readers. Salinas writes as if he is the first person to see a particular object or feel a certain emotion and he tries to convey to the reader this sense of the wonder hidden behind familiar, banal things.\n\nSalinas has often been compared with Guillén. To some extent this is because they were good friends and slightly older than most of the other leading members of their generation, as well as following similar career-paths, but they also seemed to share a similar approach to poetry. Their poems often have a rarefied quality and tend not to deal with \"particulars\", readily identifiable people and places. Nevertheless, they did differ in many respects as exemplified by the titles they gave to their published lectures on Spanish poetry. At Johns Hopkins, Salinas published a collection called \"Reality and the Poet in Spanish Poetry\", whereas Guillén's Norton lectures were called \"Language and Poetry\". Both devoted single lectures to Góngora and San Juan de la Cruz and the comparisons between them are instructive. Salinas seems to want to show us the poetic reality behind or beyond appearances, to educate us into how to see whereas Guillén gives us an account of the thoughts and sense-impressions going through his own mind: the reader is a viewer of this process not a participant in it. Vicente Aleixandre recalled visiting Salinas and finding him at his desk with his daughter on one knee and his son on the other and stretching out a hand clutching a pen to shake hands with his visitor. Although he was also devoted to his family, Guillén probably worked in a secluded study.\n\nIt was at the relatively late age of 32 that Salinas published his first collection in 1923 – both Guillén, at the age of 35, and he were the oldest of the generation to get collections published. It seems that Juan Ramón Jiménez did the main editorial work - Salinas showed him a collection of 50 poems and it was Jiménez who organised them, placing three sonnets to form a central axis as well as adding an introductory essay. The title can be translated as presages, omens, prophesies and it suggests why this book is interesting. Most of the characteristics of the poet's mature style are captured here: basically simple and colloquial language used to depict everyday things in surprising ways in order to bring out the appearance/reality duality. He tended not to use traditional Spanish verse-forms in his poetry but neither did he write free verse. There is usually some kind of assonance scheme or metrical pattern underpinning the whole. His poems also tend to be short – less than 20 lines long – and playful in tone. One of the longer poems in this collection of untitled poems is \"31\", which deals with the apparently independent life of the poet's shadow. Eventually, the fact that he cannot control it makes him commit \"fratricide\" by retreating indoors, to a shadow-free zone. In such poems, the influence of the Golden Age stylistic tendency conceptismo is apparent and this becomes more marked in future collections.\n\nThis book gathers together poems written between 1924 and 1928. The title is hard to render in English – sure or certain chance – but it seems to allude to the poet's confidence or certainty that he will find random moments of beauty or wonder in everyday life. The title might also suggest a growing self-confidence inside the poet. The appearance/reality conflict is now increasingly illustrated by examples gathered from life in a modern metropolis.\n\nA key poem is \"Vocación\". Its first stanza is almost a paraphrase of Guillén's view of poetry as a contemplation of something in the world – saying the right words brings reality alive. The central stanza shows that Salinas questions this approach, which seems to give the poet no role beyond that of a mere spectator. In the final stanza, he gives his own conception of poetry, in which he closes his eyes and sees how blurry and incomplete the observed world is until a poet comes along to supply what is lacking to make it something perfect.\n\nIn \"Navecerrada, abril\" and \"35 bujías\", Salinas uses a riddle technique which becomes a signature device in later collections. The actual subject of the poem is only identified at the end of the poem - a technique that could derive from \"conceptismo\" or maybe Mallarmé. In the former poem, it is easy to jump to the conclusion that this is a poem about a pair of lovers. Only in the final line is it made clear that the poet is addressing his poem to a car, which he has stopped for a moment to contemplate the view from a high mountain pass. In the latter, Salinas goes a step further and tries to restore a sense of wonder to an everyday object by translating it to a mythological or legendary world. He develops the conceit of the filament of an electric light as a princess locked in a glass prison, guarded by rays of sunshine. He can only free her at night, by pressing a switch. In \"Quietud\", he writes a poem about the challenge of the blank sheet of paper – a theme explored by Mallarmé, and by Cernuda as well. However, for Salinas, perfection can be achieved by a poem remaining incomplete.\n\n\"Nivel preferido\" is a key poem for understanding Salinas's choice of subject-matter. He grew up in the capital city and is arguably more of an urban person than most of his generation, who tended to come from provincial capitals. His poems rarely feature landscapes and wide, open spaces: this is because such views have largely been catalogued so that anyone with a Baedeker or travel guide can interpret them. What Salinas likes are little unobserved details, which abound in uncatalogued urban scenes.\n\nThis collection appeared in 1931 and presents the culmination of this phase of Salinas's poetry – it is in effect a continuation and extension of themes and techniques found in \"Seguro azar\". \"La otra\" is an intriguing poem about a girl who decides to commit suicide but not by poison, shooting or strangulation: instead, she lets her soul die. She continues to be photographed and mentioned in the gossip-columns and nobody notices that she is dead. This shows the development of a more serious tendency in Salinas to go with the playful way he had drawn on \"conceptismo\" in earlier works.\n\nIn \"Lo nunca igual\", it is possible to see again the essential difference between Salinas and Guillén. The latter, on waking up, welcomes the return of familiar things. Salinas, on the other hand, on returning to familiar surroundings, welcomes the novelty added by his absence: these are not the things he left behind but new discoveries, despite appearances.\n\nThis collection also includes one of his most anthologised poems, \"Underwood girls\". This is another of those riddle poems that mythologise the everyday. The \"girls\" are the keys of a typewriter awaiting the touch of an operator to awaken them from centuries of slumber.\n\nHis love poetry is generally considered to be the highest peak of his achievement as a poet. It was written between 1933 and 1939 and was published in \"La voz a ti debida\" (1933), and \"Razón de amor\" (1936). A third collection, \"Largo lamento\", was not published during the poet's lifetime, only appearing in full in 1971. For many years, it was assumed that these poems were rhetorical exercises - poems that use the techniques and devices of his earlier poems but focused on an imaginary love affair. Among the people who knew him well at the time, Cernuda thought that they were playful exercises, not seeing any great significance in them. Guillén, on the other hand, takes them very seriously but gives no sign that they might have been based in reality, real feelings. He even quotes the view of the critic Leo Spitzer that this is love poetry where the beloved is a phenomenon created by the poet, whilst asserting that this point of view is fundamentally mistaken. However, in 2002, Enric Bou published a set of letters sent by Salinas to Katherine R. Whitmore between the years 1932-47. She taught Spanish at Smith College, Northampton, Mass. In 1932, she spent her summer vacation in Madrid, where she met Salinas and they fell in love. A few weeks later, she returned to Northampton. She returned to spend the academic year 1934-5 in Madrid where they picked up their affair. However, on learning that Salinas's wife had discovered what was happening and had tried to commit suicide, she broke off relations. A sporadic correspondence continued afterwards but she married another man and the affair was over. The very shortness of the affair, two summers and an academic year, perhaps explains why it seems to have gone unsuspected by his close friends. The intensity of his feelings, however, are captured in the letters and, above all, in these collections of poetry. Guillén seems to have been the person who tracked down what had happened.\n\nThis book has the sub-title \"Poema\" and it is indeed conceived as a single poem whose various episodes do not have individual titles or numbers. It takes its title from the third \"Eclogue\" of Garcilaso de la Vega. An ever new \"I\" eagerly pursues an ever new \"you\" but there is always something that eludes him. The devices of \"conceptismo\", such as paradox and conceits, are drawn upon again perhaps in more complex ways than before because he is dealing with abstract concepts such as love. The language, however, remains very simple.\n\nIn the section \"Por qué tienes nombre tú…\" the poet shows his frustration at the inadequacy of words to capture the wonder he finds in the things they designate. If his lover did not have a name then he would feel that he was creating her.\n\nIn \"Tú no las puedes ver…\" he uses the riddle technique, holding back the banal word \"tears\" to the end to emphasise its inability to capture all the thoughts that have gone through his mind on seeing them and kissing them.\n\nThis book takes its title from a poem from the early 13th century and falls into two sections. The first consists of untitled and unnumbered poems like those of \"La voz a ti debida\"; the second comprises eight long poems with individual titles. The subject-matter and approach is much the same as in the earlier collection but there is more assurance in the handling of the poetry. Again there is an emphasis on the inability of language to convey what the poet feels.\n\"Beso será\" develops the conceit that things that the lovers see and feel whilst they are apart, the \"appearances\" of trees, breezes, leaves etc., become the \"reality\" of the kiss when the lovers are reunited. They only become real when the lovers meet again.\n\nThe poems that form this collection were written between 1936-39. A selection from them had been published in 1957 under the title \"Volverse sombra y otras poemas\". In the first edition of his \"Poesías completas\" that his daughter Solita brought out in 1971, she restored the original title and gathered together 21 poems. In the 1981 edition, she added a further 26 poems, considerably expanding the size of the collection. The manuscript, which existed almost entirely in typescript, was made up of 5 distinct groups of texts, 3 found in Gilman Hall at the Johns Hopkins campus and the other 2 amongst the poet's papers in his house in Newland Road, Baltimore. The state of the manuscripts varied between finished and properly typed up, finished by the poet but not properly typed up, and draft. Amongst the drafts, there were some that the editor felt were complete enough to merit publication.\n\nNevertheless, there are two distinct types of poems included in this collection - poems that seem like a continuation of the mood and style of \"Razón de amor\" and poems that seem to embody the title given to this collection: long lament. This title does not actually appear in any of the manuscripts: it only comes from letters to his Argentinian friend Guillermo de Torre and Jorge Guillén. The original conception of \"Largo lamento\" was seen by Guillén in 1938 but was subsequently put aside by the author, as was the continuation of \"Razón de amor\".\n\nAlthough this was published in 1946, the poems were inspired by the sea at Puerto Rico during his stay in 1943-44. It bears an epigraph from Guillen's 1945 edition of \"Cántico\" – again emphasising the strong links between the two men – on the subject of light being the best guide. The book also has a subtitle \"Tema con variaciones\" and the most noticeable aspect of these variations is the use of strict Spanish metrical forms such as \"silvas\" and \"romances\". In \"Language and Poetry\", Guillén says, \"Even a Salinas…composed an occasional sonnet\" but it is not until this work that he showed any sustained signs of interest in formal metrical structures. The vocabulary is more florid than in earlier works and there are even occasional uses of hyperbaton. These features are characteristic of the style of Góngora and lead the reader to wonder whether this is not his long-delayed contribution to the Tercentenary celebrations.\n\nThe collection shows signs of a new approach to the city and urban life that had been foreshadowed in a few poems such as \"La otra\" but which was outweighed by his fascination with incidental flashes of beauty and harmony. In \"Variación XII\" he sets up an opposition between the purity of the sea and the ugliness of the city of commerce. The city is described in terms reminiscent of Lorca's \"Poeta en Nueva York\", which is a major change in Salinas's outlook.\n\nPublished in 1949, this collection gathers poems written between 1937-47. Although Salinas was never a political poet, in his American exile he saw the development of the machine-civilisation, enslaving its citizens to a world of commerce, figures and senseless advertising slogans – as in \"Nocturno de los avisos\". The last poem in the collection, \"Cero\", is a long lament expressing his horror and sadness that the pinnacle of scientific ingenuity, which should be a progressive force, has been to create something as destructive as the atomic bomb. The only consolation that he can find is revealed in \"Lo inútil\". Impractical, immaterial, unsought among the values of the modern world, doing no harm to others, \"useless\" poetry is what makes life worthwhile for him.\n\nThese last poems were published in 1954, three years after his death, and suggest that the attitude of his previous two collections was only a passing phase. There is a return to the optimism that characterises most of his work. He reasserts his belief in the most enduring factors of life, not tied to any particular set of historical circumstances and therefore able to outlast them. The final poem is the one that was used to provide a title for the collection. It consists of a string of adverbial subjunctive clauses with the main subject continually suppressed – the implication being that it is poetry itself that will survive as long as certain things continue to happen or exist.\n\nHis work as a playwright is little-known in the English-speaking world.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1958175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958175", "title": "Public transport in Istanbul", "text": "Public transport in Istanbul\n\nPublic transport in Istanbul comprises a bus network, various rail systems, funiculars, and maritime services to serve the more than 13 million inhabitants of the city spread over an area of 5712 km².\n\nPublic road transport in Istanbul dates back to 30 August 1869, when a contract to build a tram system in the capital of the Ottoman Empire was signed. With this agreement, Konstantin Krepano Efendi’s \"Société des Tramways de Constantinople\" obtained the concession to operate public transportation for forty years. The inauguration of four lines of horse-driven trams was in 1871. In the first year, the horsecars transported 4.5 million people on the lines Azapkapı-Galata, Aksaray-Yedikule, Aksaray-Topkapı and Eminönü-Aksaray. More lines were added in the following years. 430 horses were used to draw the 45 carriages, including 15 summer-type and some double-deckers, on track. In 1912, the horse-drawn tram had to cease to operate for one year because the Ministry of Defence sent all the horses to the front during the Balkan War. \nThe tram network was electrified by overhead contact wire on 2 February 1914. The tram began to run on the Anatolian part of Istanbul on 8 June 1928 between Üsküdar and Kısıklı. By the 1950s, the length of the tram lines reached . The trams were on service on the European side of the city until 12 August 1961 and on the Asian side until 14 November 1966.\n\nThe same time as the horsecar started to run, construction of the Tünel, a short funicular between Pera and Galata, began on 30 July 1871. The funicular opened to service on 5 December 1874, the second oldest subway in the world after the London underground. In the beginning, only freight and livestock were transported. On 17 January 1875, after completing the test runs, the funicular was opened to the public. It is still in service.\n\nA commuter rail line was built on the European side of the city from Sirkeci to Hadımköy in 1872, which was followed in 1873 on the Anatolian part from Haydarpaşa Terminal to İzmit.\n\nThe ferry is one of the oldest means of transit in İstanbul, a city with two parts separated by the Bosphorus strait and surrounded by sea. In 1837, British and Russian owned boats started transport on the Bosphorus. The İstanbul Maritime Company was established in 1851 by a decree of Ottoman Sultan Abdülmecid I. The ferry service began in 1853 with six paddle steamers built in the Robert White shipyard in England. The service was extended in 1859 to places around Golden Horn. After 1903 screw-driven steamboats were put in service. Until 1929 boats were imported; later on the ferries were built in the shipyards in Golden Horn. At its peak the fleet contained 40 boats. In 1867, the same company started vehicle transport across the Boğaziçi (Bosphorus) between Kabataş and Üsküdar with two ferries purchased from England, as the first scheduled ferry lines in the world. All ferry companies were nationalized in 1945.\n\nBus transportation in İstanbul started in 1926 with four Renault-Scania buses between Beyazıt and Karaköy. The fleet grew up from 9 buses in 1942 to 16 in 1955 and to 525 buses in 1960, and then became the backbone of public transport in an ever-enlarging city.\n\nSeveral British and French companies operated all public transport in İstanbul until 16 June 1939, the date of nationalization. The newly established company İETT (İstanbul Electric Tram and Tünel Company) took over from then on the task of public transport in İstanbul.\n\nOn 27 May 1961 trolleybuses were put in service first between Topkapı and Eminönü following the elimination of trams. However, they were taken out of service some time later because they also hindered the growing traffic in the narrow streets of the old city.\n\nIn 1988, a company called Ulaşım A.Ş. (Transport Inc.) was established to run the services of LRT (since 1989), Metro (since 2000) and Modern Trams (since 1992) by the Municipality of Istanbul. The company is still active and will be the operator of the new rail lines.\n\nThe first line (M1) began service on 3 September 1989 between Aksaray and Kartaltepe. The line was further developed step-by-step and reached Atatürk Airport on 20 December 2002. The line has 18 stations and is long. As of 2012, daily ridership was 416 journey and 210,000 passengers. Even if its numbered as the first line, actually the line is a LRT system with many common characteristics with the T4 line, including the rolling stock. Though they are categorized differently by the operator.\n\nThe construction of the underground railway in Istanbul began in 1992. The \"first line\" (M2) between Taksim and 4th Levent went into service on September 16, 2000. This line is 8.5 km long and has 6 stations, which all look similar but are in different colors.\n\nA northern extension from 4th Levent to Atatürk Oto Sanayi station in Maslak (Ayazağa) entered service in 2009, as well as a southern extension from Taksim to Şişhane station in Beyoğlu, near the northern entrance of Tünel. Last northern extension for short term, Hacı Osman was opened in 2011. The rest of the southern section of the metro, which will run to Yenikapı, across the Golden Horn on a bridge and underground through the old city, is also under construction. The southern extension of M2 from Şişhane to Yenikapı over the new Golden Horn Bridge is opened in 2013 permitting the line to reach the Yenikapı Transfer Center. Finally the Airport (M1A) and Bağcılar (M1B) lines' eastern terminus was extended from Aksaray to this transfer center in 2014.\n\nOn the Asian side, 26.5 km (16.5 mi) long M4 line opened on 17 August 2012 up to Kartal. The line will have a total of 19 stations when the second section as far as Kaynarca opens. A connection to Sabiha Gökçen Airport is proposed.\n\nConstruction has also begun on the M5 which will link Üskudar, Ümraniye and Çekmeköy on the Asian side.\n\nCurrently there are 124 Hyundai-Rotem (M2) and 120 CAF (M4) trains in service. A trip along the entire line takes 27 (M2) and 32 (M4) minutes.\n\nAll lines are operated by Metro Istanbul (the new name of Istanbul Ulaşım A.Ş.) which belongs to the Municipality of Istanbul.\n\nIstanbul inaugurated horse trams in 1872 and these served the people of Istanbul until 1912. Following this date, electric trams were put in place and they were the main means for urban public transport until 1966. Many routes were built step by step, and it reached their most widespread network in 1956 with 108 million passengers in 270 shuttles in 56 lines. Tramcars were not modernized for many decades, and some of the 1911 electric cars were still running in the 1960s. At that time modern buses provided faster and smoother journeys. Because of those negative issues, tram system closed in mid-1960s.\n\nFrom the early 1970s, traffic congestion worsened. By the mid-1980s, Istanbulians realized that the uncontrolled extension of motorization & closure of the tram network had been a mistake. Other cities around the world, e.g. Tunis and Buenos Aires, also understood that error, and like them, Istanbul also planned the return of tramway.\n\nAs an experiment, Istanbul first opened a heritage tram at European side in 1990. Due to increasing popularity, they opened a modern tram system starting in 1992, also at European side. Now, the Asian side has a heritage tram system, whereas the European side has both a heritage tram and a modern tram system.\n\nThe modern tram consists of lines T1 and T4, initially operated with 55 low-floor Bombardier Flexity Swift and 32 Alstom Citadis.\nThe other line (T4) was opened in 2007 between Edirnekapı and Mescid-i Selam. There are 22 stations and length is 15,3 km . Since March 2009, the line works between Topkapı and Hapibler Service is operated with LRT vehicles built by SGP in 1989. As of 2012, daily ridership was 380 journey and 100,000 passenger.\n\nStarting from June 2013, suburban lines on both sides of the city (Istanbul suburban and Haydarpaşa suburban) were closed for rehabilitation works as well as for their fusion into a single line by the means of an undersea tunnel through the Bosphorus as part of the Marmaray project.\n\nOn 12 March 2019, the whole parts of the Marmaray are operational.\n\nIstanbul is served by two underground funicular railways, of very different ages and styles.\n\nThe older of these lines is the Tünel. This line is the oldest underground metro line in continental Europe, and the second in the world after London. The Tünel is 573 m long with an altitude difference of 60 m and no intermediate stations between Karaköy and Tünel Square. It has been continuously in service since 1875. It was originally steam-powered with two wooden trains serving parallel tracks. It was modernized in 1971. Today the line is single-track with a passing loop, electrically powered and runs on rubber tyres with rebuilt ex-RATP MP 55 vehicles. A trip takes approximately 1.5 minutes. About 15,000 people use the line each day.\nUnlike the modern one below which runs at strictly five-minute intervals, this one has a less regular schedule.\n\nOpened in June 2006, a second modern funicular line, the Kabataş-Taksim Funicular, is operated by Ulaşım A.Ş. and connects the Seabus port and tram stop of Kabataş with the metro station at Taksim Square. It is about 600 meters long and climbs approximately 60 meters in 110 seconds.\n\nThe bus rapid transit (BRT) system in Istanbul is called \"Metrobüs\". The construction of the Metrobüs BRT line began in 2005. The first line runs between Avcılar and Söğütlüçeşme. This line is 41.5 km long and has 35 stations, which are located on Istanbul's Main Highway, called the D 100. It is currently operated with Mercedes Capacity, Mercedes-Benz Citaro, and some Phileas buses. Daily ridership is 715.000 passenger.\n\nAn extension to Beylikdüzü opened in 2012.\n\nThe bus fleet has a total of 4,012 vehicles built by MAN, Ikarus, Mercedes-Benz, BMC, Phileas, Otokar, Temsa and Güleryüz. In 2012 the daily ridership was 3,621,908 passengers, representing 30% of the city's total daily transportation.\n\nSince 1985, privately owned ÖHO (\"Özel Halk Otobüsü\" - Private Public Bus) buses have been allowed to operate under the authority of İETT. There are 2,157 private owned public buses, including 144 double-deckers. There are 783 bus lines excluding diversions as of May 21, 2018. Many routes have diversions running one roundtrip a day on average, which usually feed less developed suburbs around frequent routes. Some routes also provide short turning services at peak hours for crowded stops. Those diversions are listed under the same headsign reference as main route. Buses running diversion routes do not display route numbers, spelling out the route on the headsign in detail instead.\nIn 2010, the municipality decided to found a new company called Otobüs A.Ş. (Bus Inc.) in order to more quickly replace old vehicles. Otobüs A.Ş. had a fleet of 544 vehicles as of December 2012. The vehicles are fully low floor and certified to Euro 5 standards. In 2014, IETT carried 1.31 billion ticketed passengers, a record for a Turkish transport system. İETT is currently trialling outsourcing the drivers and maintenance into private bus company Akkurtlar. Outsourced drivers can be distinguished by their uniforms.\n\nFerryboats sail on 15 lines serving 27 seaports on the shores of Bosphorus and Sea of Marmara. The 20 older ferryboats carry 61 million passengers yearly. In the 1980s 150 million people were transported.\n\nToday, there are 3 types of ferry in İstanbul; Sea Busses (İDO), Vapur's (traditional name for commuter ferries) and private motorboats.\n\nThe first steam ferries appeared on the Bosphorus in 1837 and were operated by private sector companies. On 1 January 1851, the \"Şirket-i Hayriye\" (literally \"The Goodwill Company\", as the Istanbul Ferry Company was originally called) was established by the Ottoman state. The \"Şirket-i Hayriye\" continued to operate the city's landmark commuter ferries until the early years of the Republican period; when they went under the direction of \"Türkiye Denizcilik İşletmeleri\" (\"Turkish State Maritime Lines\"). Since March 2006, Istanbul's traditional commuter ferries have been operated by municipality. In 2017, the municipality established a system for musicians to play live music for passengers in the lower salons of most ferry lines.\n\nThe current design of the Istanbul ferries, as we know them today, was largely created by the Fairfield Shipbuilders of Glasgow, Scotland, which also built the largest amount of Istanbul ferries since 1851. The companies which designed and built the traditional commuter ferries of Istanbul include the White Shipbuilders of East Cowes, England (models of 1854-1860); the M. Wigram Shipbuilders of London, England (models of 1863-1869); Maudslay & Sons of London, England (models of 1870-1872); R. & H. Green Shipbuilders of London, England (models of 1872-1890 and 1894–1896); J. W. Thames of London, England (models of 1890-1893); Napier, Shanks & Bell of Glasgow, Scotland (models of 1893-1894); Fairfield Shipbuilders of Glasgow, Scotland (models of 1903-1906, 1910–1911, 1914–1929, and 1938–1962); Armstrong Shipbuilders in Newcastle and Glasgow, United Kingdom (models of 1905-1907); Atl. & Chantiers de France in Dunkerque, France (models of 1907-1911); Hawthorn Leslie and Company in Newcastle, England (models of 1911); Kinderdijk L. Smith & Zoon Ltd, Holland (models of 1951); Cantieri Navali di Taranto SPA, Taranto, Italy (models of 1952); and Hasköy, Camialtı, and İstinye Shipyards in Istanbul (models of 1929-1938 and 1962–1989).\n\nOn 16 April 1987 the Municipality of Istanbul established a company to provide fast sea transport with catamaran-type \"seabuses\". With the first ten vessels purchased from Norway, modernization of sea transportation was achieved. Today, the company İDO serves 29 terminals with a fleet of 28 catamarans, including six fast car ferries.\n\nThere is a short gondola lift line above the Democracy Park in the valley between Taksim and Maçka, the Maçka Gondola (), built in 1993. It connects the hotels Hilton Istanbul Bosphorus on one side with Parksa Hilton and Swissotel The Bosphorus on the other side. The cable line is long and transports in two cabins with six seats each around 1,000 passengers daily. The trip takes three minutes.\n\nA second aerial lift line, the Eyüp Gondola () was opened in 2005 between the historical district of Eyüp and the Pierre Loti Hill. The gondola lift, built by the Italian Leitner Ropeways Co. of Leitner Group was the most expensive cable car line in Turkey costing 5 million Euros.\n\nThe average time that people spend commuting with public transit in Istanbul, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 91 min. About 30% of public transit users ride for more than 2 h every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 19 min, and 36% of riders wait for over 20 min on average every day. The average distance that people usually ride in a single trip by public transit is 12 km, and 35% travel for over 12 km.\n\nIstanbul has an integrated electronic ticket system for bus, funiculars, LRT, metro, commuter trains, ferryboats and trams. The system uses smart RFID cards, called Istanbulkart, as tickets. The old Akbil iButtons were phased out in 2015.\n\n\nThese official websites include timetables and maps\nBuses & Funicular\n\nTrains & Trams\n\nFerry Services \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1958179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958179", "title": "Arkadi Monastery", "text": "Arkadi Monastery\n\nThe Arkadi Monastery (in Greek: / Μονή Αρκαδίου) is an Eastern Orthodox monastery, situated on a fertile plateau 23 km (14 mi) to the southeast of Rethymnon on the island of Crete in Greece.\n\nThe current catholicon (church) dates back to the 16th century and is marked by the influence of the Renaissance. This influence is visible in the architecture, which mixes both Roman and baroque elements. As early as the 16th century, the monastery was a place for science and art and had a school and a rich library. Situated on a plateau, the monastery is well fortified, being surrounded by a thick and high wall.\n\nThe monastery played an active role in the Cretan resistance of Ottoman rule during the Cretan revolt of 1866. 943 Greeks, mostly women and children, sought refuge in the monastery. After three days of battle and under orders from the hegumen (abbot) of the monastery, the Cretans blew up barrels of gunpowder, choosing to sacrifice themselves rather than surrender.\n\nThe monastery became a national sanctuary in honor of the Cretan resistance. 8 November is a day of commemorative parties in Arkadi and Rethymno. The explosion did not end the Cretan insurrection, but it attracted the attention of the rest of the world.\n\nThe Arkadi Monastery is located in the Rethymno regional unit, 25 km southeast of Rethymno. The Monastery is situated on a rectangular plateau on the northwest side of Mount Ida (Crete), at an altitude of 500 m. The Arkadian region is fertile and has vineyards, olive groves and pine, oak and Cyprus forests. The plateau on which the monastery rests is surrounded by hills. The west side of the plateau stops abruptly and falls off into gorges. The gorges start at Tabakaria and lead to Stavromenos, to the east of Rethymno. The Arkadian gorges have a rich diversity of plants and native wildflowers.\n\nThe area the monastery is located in first developed in antiquity. The presence of Mount Ida (Crete), which is a sacred mountain because it was legendarily the childhood home of Zeus, made the area attractive to early settlers. Five km to the northeast, the city of Eleftherna had its cultural peak in the time of Homer and in classical antiquity, but its influence was also felt in the early Christian and Byzantine periods.\n\nThe closest village to the monastery is Amnatos, located three km to the north. The villages that surround Arkadi are rich in Byzantine relics that prove the early wealth of the region. The Moni Arseniou monastery, which is several km north of Arkadi, was also an example of the grand Cretan monasteries.\n\nArkadi Monastery is in the shape of a nearly rectangular parallelogram. The interior resembles a fortress and is 78.5 metres long on the north wall, 73.5 metres on the south wall, 71.8 metres on the east wall and 67 metres on the west wall. The total area of the monastery is 5200 m².\n\nThe exact date of the founding of the monastery is not precisely known. According to tradition, the foundation of the monastery is sometimes attributed to the Byzantine emperor Heraclius and sometimes to the emperor Arcadius in the 5th century. And, according to the second version, the monastery took its name from the name of the emperor. However, in Crete, it is common for monasteries to be named after the monk that founded the building, which lends support to the theory that Arkadi may have been founded by a monk named Arkadios. Other such monasteries are Vrontisiou, Arsiniou and Aretiou.\n\nAccording to Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, the monastery was built on the site of an ancient city, Arcadia. Legend tells that after the destruction of Arcadia, all the springs and fountains stopped flowing until a new city was built. However, in 1837, Robert Pashley found evidence to suggest that it was impossible for the monastery to have been built on the ruins of another city, so this idea has lost credence.\n\nIn 1951, the professor K. Kalokyris published an inscription dating to the 14th century and verified the hypothesis that a monastery was dedicated to Saint Constantine in this period. The inscription was located on the pediment of a church that predates the current one, over the entrance door. It read:\n\n\"The church carrying the name of Arkadi is consecrated to Saint Constantine.\"\n\nTowards the end of the 16th century, the monastery was subject to restorations and transformations largely headed by Klimis and Vissarion Chortatzis, without a doubt from the family of Hortatzis of Rethymno (a name associated with the Cretan Renaissance) and Georgios Chortatzis, the author of Erofili. Klimis Hortatzis was the hegumen of the abbey and in 1573, he made the monastery cenobitic.\n\nHe oversaw the building of the church, which took twenty-five years and was believed to have begun in 1562. In 1586, the façade of the building was built, as were the two naves. An inscription at the base of the clock also dates it back to 1587. This inscription is as following:\n« ΑΦ ΚΛΜΧΤΖ ΠΖ »\nor : « 15 Klimis Chortatzis 87 »\n\nKlimis Chortatzis likely died soon after the completion and was not able to attend the inauguration of the new church, which was sometime between 1590 and 1596. This is known thanks to a letter of the Patriarch of Alexandria, Mélétios Pigas, in which he wrote that the inauguration ceremony was entrusted to Klimis's successor, the hegumen Mitrofanis Tsyrigos. Although this letter wasn't dated, one can place it between 1590, when Mélétios Pigas was ordained the Patriarch, and 1596, when the hegumen Nicéphore succeeded Tsygiros.\n\nDuring the period of the first three hegumens, and up to the beginning of the 17th century, the Arkadi Monastery continued to boom, economically and culturally. The monastery became a great centre for the copying of manuscripts, and although the majority were lost during the destruction of the building by the Ottomans in 1866, some survive in foreign libraries. The monastery grew, with the construction of a stables in 1610 and a refectory in 1670.\n\nIn 1645, the Ottoman Empire began their campaign to conquer Crete. In the spring of 1648, they controlled the major part of the island, with the exception of Heraklion, Gramvousa, Spinalonga and Suda, which remained under Venetian rule.\n\nAfter the capture of Rethymno in 1648, the Ottomans pillaged the monastery. The monks and the hegumen Simon Halkiopoulos took refuge in the Vrontissi Monastery. They were allowed to return after having sworn allegiance to Hussein Pasha, who also gave them the right to ring the monastery's bell. The Arkadi Monastery therefore became the \"Çanlı Manastır\" (\"Monastery where the bell is rung\" in Turkish). A firman authorized the rebuilding of the destroyed monasteries according to their original plans, without changes. Arkadi benefited but abused its rights by adding new buildings.\n\nDuring the Ottoman Period, the monastery continued to prosper, which was shown in the writing of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort. For the traveller, Arkadi was the richest and most beautiful of the monasteries of Crete. There were 100 monks that lived in the convent and 200 others that lived in the surrounding countryside. The monastery's territory extended north of the sea and to the east of Rethymno to the top of Mount Ida in the south. These lands allowed the monastery to support itself through agriculture.\n\nTournefort notes \"400 measures of oil\" produced each year, a figure which would have been doubled if the monastery did not give the inferior olives to charity. Tournefort also boasts of the monastery's cellars, which had at least 200 barrels, labelled with the name of the hegumen who blessed them each year with a prayer. The wine made at Arkadi was well known. This wine was called \"Malvoisie\" and was named after a town close to Heraklion. Franz Wilhelm Sieber, during his time in the monastery, recalled the hegumen's cellar and attributed the making of the wine to an excellent grape raised in high altitude, but that it was not produced at Malvoisie.\n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, the monastery fell into decline. Sieber, who stopped there nearly a century after Tournefort and Pococke, left a less flattering description. By the time the German visited, the monastery only had eight priests and twelve monks. Farming continued, but the monastery had debts. He recalled the hegumen who often had to go to Rethymno in order to acquire funds to pay the bills.\n\nSieber described the library of the monastery as rich in more than a thousand texts, including religious texts and those of Pindar, Petrarch, Virgil, Dante, Homer, Strabon, Thucydides and Diodore of Sicily. But the traveller mentioned their sad state, noting that he had never seen books in such bad condition and that it was impossible to distinguish the works of Aristophanes from those of Euripides.\n\nIn 1822, a group of Turkish soldiers led by a Getimalis (Yetim Ali) took hold of Arkadi and pillaged it. The civilians of Amari gathered to plan how to retake the monastery and expel Getimalis and his troops.\n\nAnother version tells of a certain Anthony Melidonos, a Sphakian from Asia Minor, who came to the island at the head of a group of Greek volunteers from Asia Minor in order to support the Cretan efforts in the War of Greek Independence. With 700 troops, he set out across the island from west to east. After the pillaging of the monastery, he changed his course and went to Arkadi instead. Arriving in the night, his troops scaled the walls of the building and fired the monastery. He jumped on Getimalis who was drinking, grabbed him and threw him to the ground outside the room. He was about to kill Getimalis when Getimalis claimed to be at the point of converting to Christianity. A baptism immediately took place and the new convert was allowed to go free.\n\nTurkish and Greek documents mention the capacity of the monastery to produce enough food for the residents of the region and to hide fugitives from the Turkish authorities. The monastery also provided education for the local Christian population. From 1833 to 1840, the monastery invested 700 Turkish piastres in the schools in the region.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, the Ottomans had occupied Crete for more than two centuries, despite frequent bloody uprisings by Cretan rebels. While the Cretans were rising against the Ottoman occupation during the War of Greek Independence, the London Protocol of 1830 dictated that the island could not be a part of the new Greek state.\n\nOn 30 March 1856, the Treaty of Paris obligated the Sultan to apply the \"Hatti-Houmayoun\", which guaranteed civil and religious equality to Christians and Muslims. The Ottoman authorities in Crete were reluctant to implement any reform. Before the majority of Muslim conversions (the majority of the former Christians had converted to Islam and then recanted), the Empire tried to recant on liberty of conscience.\nThe institution of new taxes and a curfew also added to the discontent. In April 1858, Cretans met at Boutsounaria. Finally an imperial decree on July 7, 1858 guaranteed them privileges in religious, judicial and financial matters. One of the major motivations of the revolt of 1866 was the breach of the \"Hatti-Houmayoun\".\n\nA second cause of the insurrection of 1866 was the interference of Isma'il Pasha in an internal quarrel about the organization of the Cretan monasteries. Several laymen recommended that the goods of the monasteries come under the control of a council of elders and that they be used to create schools, but they were opposed by the bishops. Isma'il Pasha intervened and designated several people to decide the subject and annulled the election of \"undesirable\" members, imprisoning the members of the committee that had been charged with going to Constantinople for presenting the subject to the Patriarch. This intervention provoked violent reactions from the Christian population of Crete.\n\nIn the spring of 1866, meetings took place in several villages. On May 14, an assembly was held in the Aghia Kyriaki monastery in Boutsounaria near Chania. They sent a petition to the Sultan and the consuls of the big powers in Chania. At the time of the first meetings of the revolutionary committees, the representatives were elected by province and the representative of the Rethymno region was the hegumen of Arkadi, Gabriel Marinakis.\n\nAt the announcement of these nominations Isma'il Pasha sent a message to the hegumen via the Bishop of Rethymno, Kallinikos Nikoletakis. The letter demanded that the hegumen dismiss the revolutionary assembly or the monastery would be destroyed by Ottoman troops. In the month of July 1866, Isma'il Pasha sent his army to capture the insurgents, but the members of the committee fled before his troops arrived. The Turks left again after destroying icons and other sacred objects that they found in the monastery.\n\nIn September, Isma'il Pasha sent the hegumen a new threat of destroying the monastery if the assembly did not yield. The assembly decided to implement a system of defense for the monastery. On September 24, Panos Koronaios arrived in Crete and landed at Bali. He marched to Arkadi, where he was made commander-in-chief of the revolt for the Rethymno region. A career military man, Koronaios believed that the monastery was not defensible. The hegumen and the monks disagreed and Koronaios conceded to them, but advised the destruction of the stables so that they could not be used by the Turks. This plan was ignored. After having named Ioannis Dimakopoulos to the post of commander of the garrison of the monastery, Koronaios left. At his departure, numerous local residents, mostly women and children, took refuge in the monastery, bringing their valuables in hopes of saving them from the Turks. By 7 November 1866, the monastery sheltered 964 people: 325 men, of which 259 were armed, the rest women and children.\n\nSince the mid-October victory of Mustafa Pasha's troops at Vafes, the majority of the Turkish army was stationed in Apokoronas and were particularly concentrated in the fortresses around the bay of Souda. The monastery refused to surrender, so Mustafa Pasha marched his troops on Arkadi. First, he stopped and sacked the village of Episkopi. From Episkopi, Mustafa sent a new letter to the revolutionary committee at Arkadi, ordering them to surrender and informing them that he would arrive at the monastery in the following days. The Ottoman army then turned toward Roustika, where Mustafa spent the night in the monastery of the prophet Elie, while his army camped in the villages of Roustika and Aghios Konstantinos. Mustafa arrived in Rethymno on 5 November where he met Turkish and Egyptian reinforcements. The Ottoman troops reached the monastery during the night of November 7-November 8. Mustafa, although he had accompanied his troops to a site relatively close, camped with his staff in the village of Messi.\n\nOn the morning of 8 November, an army of Ottomans and 30 cannons, directed by Suleyman, arrived on the hills of the monastery while Mustafa Pasha waited in the Messi. Suleyman, positioned on the hill of Kore. to the north of the monastery sent a last request for surrender. He received only gunfire in response.\n\nThe assault was begun by the Ottomans. Their primary objective was the main door of the monastery on the western face. The battle lasted all day without the Ottomans infiltrating the building. The asseiged had barricaded the door and, from the beginning, taking it would be difficult. The Cretans were relatively protected by the walls of the monastery, while the Ottomans, vulnerable to the insurgents' gunfire, suffered numerous losses. Seven Cretans took their position within the windmill of the monastery. This building was quickly captured by the Ottomans, who set it on fire, killing the Cretan warriors inside.\n\nThe battle stopped with nightfall. The Ottomans received two heavy cannons from Rethymno, one which was called \"Koutsahila\". They placed them in the stables. On the side of the insurgents, a war council decided to ask for help from Panos Koronaios and other Cretan leaders in Amari. Two Cretans left by way of the windows by ropes and, disguised as Turks, crossed the Ottoman lines. The messengers returned later in the night with the news that it was now impossible for reinforcements to arrive in time because all of the access roads had been blocked by the Ottomans.\n\nCombat began again in the evening of November 9. The cannons destroyed the doors and the Turks made it into the building, where they suffered more serious losses. At the same time, the Cretans were running out of ammunition and many among them were forced to battle with only bayonets or other sharp objects. The Turks had the advantage.\n\nThe women and children inside the monastery were hiding in the powder room. The last Cretan fighters were finally defeated and hid within the monastery. Thirty-six insurgents found refuge in the refectory, near the ammunitions. Discovered by the Ottomans, who forced the door, they were massacred.\n\nIn the powder room, where the majority of the women and children hid, Konstantinos Giaboudakis gathered the people hiding in the neighbouring rooms together. When the Turks arrived at the door of the powder room, Giaboudakis set the barrels of powder on fire and the resulting explosion resulted in numerous Turkish deaths.\n\nIn another room of the monastery holding an equal number of powder barrels, insurgents made the same gesture. But the powder was humid and only exploded partially, so it only destroyed part of the northwest wall of the room.\n\nOf the 964 people present at the start of the assault, 846 were killed in combat or at the moment of the explosion. 114 men and women were captured, but three or four managed to escape, including one of the messengers who had gone for reinforcements. The hegumen Gabriel was among the victims. Tradition holds that he was among those killed by the explosion of the barrels of powder, but it is more likely that he was killed on the first day of combat. Turkish losses were estimated at 1500. Their bodies were buried without memorials and some were thrown in the neighboring gorges. The remains of numerous Cretan Christians were collected and placed in the windmill, which was made into a reliquary in homage to the defenders of Arkadi. Among the Ottoman troops, a group of Coptic Egyptians were found on the hills outside the monastery. These Christians had refused to kill other Christians. They were executed by the Ottoman troops, and their ammunition cases left behind.\n\n114 survivors were taken prisoner and transported to Rethymno where they were subjected to numerous humiliations from the officers responsible for their transport, but also by the Muslim population who arrived to throw stones and insults when they entered the city. The women and children were imprisoned for a week in the church of the Presentation of the Virgin. The men were imprisoned for a year in difficult conditions. The Russian consulate had to intervene to require Mustafa Pasha to keep basic hygienic conditions and provide clothing to the prisoners. After one year, the prisoners were released.\n\nThe Ottomans considered taking Arkadi a big victory and celebrated it with cannon fire. However, the events at Arkadi provoked indignation among the Cretans, but also in Greece and the rest of the world. The tragedy of Arkadi turned world opinion on the conflict. The event recalled the Third Siege of Missolonghi and the numerous Philhellenists of the world were in favor of Crete. Volunteers from Serbia, Hungary and Italy arrived on the island. Gustave Glourens, a teacher at the Collège de France, enlisted and arrived in Crete by the end of 1866. He formed a small group of philhellenists with three other Frenchmen, an Englishman, an American, an Italian and a Hungarian. This group published a brochure on \"The question of the Orient and the Cretan Renaissance\", contacted French politicians and organized conferences in France and in Athens. The Cretans named him a deputy at the assembly, but he turned the position down.\n\nGiuseppe Garibaldi, in his letters, praised the patriotism of the Cretans and their wish to gain their independence. Numerous Garibaldians, moved by an ardent philhellenism, came to Crete and participated in several battles. Letters written by Victor Hugo were published in the newspaper \"Kleio\" in Trieste, which contributed to the worldwide reaction. The letters gave encouragement to the Cretans and told them that their cause would succeed. He emphasized that the drama of Arkadi was no different than the Destruction of Psara and the Third Siege of Missolonghi. He described the tragedy of Arkadi:\n\nNot finding the necessary solution from the big European powers, the Cretans sought aid from the United States. At this time, the Americans tried to establish a presence in the Mediterranean and showed support for Crete. The relationship grew as they looked for a port in the Mediterranean and they thought, among others, to buy the island of Milo or Port Island. The American public was sympathetic. The American philhellenes arrived to advocate for the idea of Cretan independence, and in 1868, a question of recognition of independent Crete was addressed in the House of Representatives, but it was decided by a vote to follow a policy of non-intervention in Ottoman affairs.\n\nThe surrounding wall of the monastery forms a nearly rectangular quadrangle and surrounds an area of 5200 m². The feeling of a fortress is reinforced by the embrasures that are on the top part of the west wall and on the southern and eastern façades. Additionally, the width of the outside eastern wall is 1.20 meters.\n\nInside the walls are buildings such as the hegumen's house, the monks' cells, the refectory, the stockrooms, the powder magazine and the hospice.\n\nThe monastery has two main doors : one to the west and one on the east of the building. Entree could also be made through smaller doors: one in the south-west, two to the north and one last on the western façade.\n\nThe main door of the monastery is on the western façade of the surrounding wall. This door is called Rethemniotiki or Haniotiki, after its orientation towards those two towns. The original door was built in 1693, by the hegumen Neophytos Drossas. A manuscript at the monastery describes the original door, which was destroyed in 1866 during the Turkish assault. Made of square stones, there were two windows, decorated with pyramid-shaped pediments and framed by ribbed columns that were decorated with lions. On the pediment, there was an inscription that read:\n\n\"Lord, watch over the spirit of your servant, the Hegumen Neophytos Drossas, and of all our Christian brothers.\"\n\nThe current door was built in 1870. The general form of the former door was conserved, with two windows at level, framed by two columns. But the inscription honoring the hegumen Drossas, the lions and the pediments were not rebuilt.\n\nOn the eastern façade of the wall is the second door to the monastery. Facing Heraklion, the door is named \"Kastrini\", after Kastro. As with the western door, the original door was destroyed in 1866 and was rebuilt in 1870.\n\nThe church is a basilica with two naves; the northern nave is dedicated to the Transfiguration of Christ and the southern nave is dedicated to Saint Constantine and Saint Helen. Saint Helen stands at the center and slightly to the south of the monastery. According to the inscription engraved on the face of the clock, the church was founded in 1587 by Klimis Hortatsis. The architecture of the building is heavily influenced by Renaissance art, as the church was built in the period in which Crete was a colony of the Republic of Venice.\n\nIn the smaller part of the front of the church, constructed by square blocks of regular brickwork, the primary element is four pairs of Corinthian columns. While there is a classically antique influence, the columns themselves, placed on elevated pedestals, are Gothic. Between each pair of columns, there is an archway. The two arches at the ends of the facade support a door and a circular opening, decorated by palm leaves on the circumference. The archway in the center of the façade is plain.\n\nOn the higher part of the façade, above the columns, there is a series of molding and elliptical openings, which are also decorated in palm leaves around the perimeter. The clock is at the centre and, at each end, there are Gothic obelisks. Comparisons of the façade of the monastery with the work of Italian architects Sebastiano Serlio and Andrea Palladio suggests that the architect of the church was probably inspired by them.\n\nIn 1645, the church was damaged by looters who destroyed the altar. Long before the capture of the monastery by the Turks in 1866, the church was torched and the icons entirely destroyed. Only a cross, two wooden angels and a passage of the resurrection of Christ were saved from the flames. The apses of the church were also destroyed.\n\nThe current iconostasis, in cypress, was erected in 1902. From 1924 to 1927, at the initiative of the archbishop Timotheos Veneris, the work of strengthening and restoration of the apses and the clock were begun. The tiles on the interior of the building were totally replaced in 1933.\n\nBefore 1866, the powder magazine was in the southern part of the interior. Slightly before the Turkish attack, and in fear that it could easily be broken into and the monastery blown up, the munitions were moved to the cellar, which was situated approximately 75 centimetres below where it had been originally placed, which was more secure. The powder magazine is an oblong vaulted building. It is 21 metres long and 5.4 metres wide and was destroyed entirely during an explosion in 1866, with the exception of a small part of the vault in the western part of the room.\n\nIn 1930, the archbishop Timotheos Veneris placed a commemorative inscription which was fit in the eastern wall in remembrance of the events of 1866. The inscription reads:\n\nThe refectory, the place where the monks took their meals, is located in the northern aisle of the monastery. It was built in 1687, which is mentioned in the inscription located below the door leading into courtyard of the refectory. On this inscription, one can read the name of Neophytos Drossas.\n\nFrom this courtyard, one can reach the hegumen's home by a staircase and the refectory. Above the door to the refectory, there is an inscription engraved in the lintel of the door in the honor of the virgin Mary and a hegumen preceding Neophytos Drossas. The refectory is a rectangular room of 18.10 meters long and 4.80 meters wide. It is covered by a vault. The eastern part holds the kitchens.\n\nThis building, which has not changed since its construction in 1687, is the place where the last fighting in the assault of 1866 took place. One can still see the traces of bullets and swords in the wood of the tables and chairs.\n\nThe northwestern part of the monastery holds a hospice. Before 1866, this place held the hegumen's home, which was completely destroyed in the battle. It was a two-story building, the ground floor of which held kitchens and a dining room. From the dining room, a staircase led to a big room called the Synode room and was where the monks gathered after services.\n\nAfter 1866, the house was left in ruins for a number of years due to a lack of funds to rebuild. Near the end of the 19th century, the hegumen Gabriel Manaris visited several cities in Russia to try to raise funds to reconstruct the building. He collected money, sacred urns and priestly clothing. In 1904, under the direction of the bishop of Rethymno, Dionyssios, the house was cleared and replaced with a hospice, which was finished in 1906.\n\nOutside the monastery, approximately 50 metres from the western door, are located the former stables of the monastery. They were constructed in 1714 by the hegumen Neophytos Drossas, which can be seen from the inscription over the door.\n\nThe building is 23.9 metres long and 17.2 metres wide. It is divided into three sections, each 4.3 metres. The internal and external walls are 1 metre wide. A staircase leads to the roof. The building sheltered the monastery's animals, but also was a room for the farm laborers. Traces of the battle in 1866 are still visible, particularly on the staircase and the window jambs on the eastern wall.\n\nOutside the monastery, about sixty metres to the west, there is a structure commemorating the sacrifice of the Cretans who died in 1866. This memorial, situated on the plateau that the monastery is located on, dominates the gorges.\n\nThe remains of the dead from the 1866 siege are stored in a glazed shelf. These bones clearly show battle scars and are pierced by bullets and swordcuts. An inscription commemorates the sacrifice of the fallen Cretans:\nOf an octagonal shape, this structure is the former windmill which was later transformed into a storage room. It served as a boneyard for a short time after the siege and acquired its current shape in 1910 at the initiative of Dionyssios, then the bishop of Rethymnon.\n\n"}

In any given season a club plays each of the others in the same division twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents. This makes for a total of 38 games played each season in LaLiga and 42 in Segunda División.\n\nClubs gain three points for a win, one for a draw, and none for a defeat. At the end of each season, the club with the most points in LaLiga Santander is crowned champion. If points are equal, the head-to-head records determine the winner. If still equal, the goal difference and then goals scored become the deciding factors. As for Segunda División, at the top end three clubs win promotion to LaLiga, with the bottom three LaLiga clubs taking their places. At the lower end, four clubs are relegated to Segunda División B, while four teams from Segunda División B join LaLiga SmartBank in their stead.\n\nThe General Assembly is the deliberative assembly of the LFP. It is composed of the 42 football clubs and public limited sports companies (, S.A.D.) that make up the Primera and Segunda División. Each club/S.A.D. is usually represented by its respective president.\n\nThe president, along with the other members of the Executive Committee, is responsible for the day-to-day running of the organisation. The current president is Javier Tebas, who was elected to the post in April 2013 and re-elected in October 2016.\n\nIn February 2011 the LFP threatened strike action if the Spanish government did not lift the ruling that one game per week must be shown free. The ruling was introduced in 1997 and the LFP want it lifted for the 2012–13 season. Spain's LFP threatens to halt games over TV row. Recently (2015) RFEF announced that they would stop the games from 16 May onwards, following a row with Spanish Authorities where RFEF is demanding Spanish Authorities to stop interrupting in LFP's financial issues. They said in a statement: \"Regarding the decision adopted by the RFEF's General Assembly to indefinitely suspend all football competitions at every level, the LFP states that it has taken the corresponding legal actions in defence of the rights and legitimate interests of the clubs, as well as the rights of the competitions that it organises and that have been grossly affected by the aforementioned decision by the RFEF. The RFEF's decision is null and void by law... given that the sports law and the current co-ordination agreement attributes to the LFP the right to organise professional competitions and approve the sporting calendar of those competitions. The LFP expressly reserves the right to take legal action to claim for the serious damages as well as any financial, sporting, social or any other type of harm that may arise from the RFEF's decision.\"\n\nOn 22 November 2013, Huawei became the global partner of Liga de Fútbol Profesional. The official ball supplier for the Liga de Fútbol Profesional is Nike who have had the contract since the 1996–97 until 2018–19 season when they took over from Adidas. Starts from 2019–20, German sportswear company Puma became the official provider of match balls.\n\n\n"}

Harris\n\nCharles Kassel Harris (May 1, 1867 – December 22, 1930) was a well regarded American songwriter of popular music. During his long career, he advanced the relatively new genre, publishing more than 300 songs, often deemed by admirers as the \"king of the tear jerkers\". He is one of the early pioneers of Tin Pan Alley.\n\nHarris was born in Poughkeepsie, New York into a family of ten children. His father was a fur trader and moved the family to Saginaw, Michigan and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he grew up. From his early fascination with the banjo, he wrote his first song \"Since Maggie Learned To Skate\" for the play \"The Skating Rink\" by Nat Goodwin in 1885.\n\nIn 1892, Harris wrote \"After the Ball\", a song about an old man recounting the story of his long-lost love to his niece. He caught the attention of John Philip Sousa, who played the tune at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago, boosting sheet music sales to in excess of five million copies in the 1890s. In 1926, Harris published his autobiography bearing the title, \"After the Ball;\" and, according to \"The New York Times Book Review\", the book generated a \" of letters from amateur musicians expressing their high regard for his work.\"\n\nIn 1906 Harris also penned and self-published the book \"How to Write a Popular Song\".\n\nHis next hit \"Break the News to Mother\", about a dying soldier, coincided with the Spanish–American War in 1897 and furthered his popularity. It was also a hit during 1917 and 1918, with recordings by the Shannon Four and Henry Burr.\n\nIn 1899, he drew upon his own experiences as a Jew to compose \"A Rabbi's Daughter\" \n\nHarris's sentimental songs were introduced on stages and music halls, but they found ready acceptance among folkloric string bands of the South. Both \"Fallen By the Wayside\"' and \"There’ll Come a Time\" were recorded by Charlie Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers, and both \"Mid the Green Fields of Virginia\" and his extremely popular song from 1901, \"Hello Central, Give Me Heaven\", were recorded by The Carter Family.\n\nLater, Harris began writing songs for musicals, working with Oscar Hammerstein. His plays \"The Scarlet Sisters\" and \"What's The Matter With Julius\" had moderate success. He died in New York City in 1930.\n\n"}

{"id": "1958192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958192", "title": "Tony James (musician)", "text": "Tony James (musician)\n\nAnthony Eric James (born 12 April 1953) is an English pop musician and producer, who was the bassist for the 1970s–1980s bands Generation X, Sigue Sigue Sputnik and The Sisters of Mercy.\n\nTony James was born in Shepherd's Bush in West London on 12 April 1953, and spent his childhood years in Twickenham. After formal education at Hampton Grammar School he attended Brunel University, from which he graduated with first-class honours in mathematics and computer science. Before becoming a professional musician he was briefly employed as a computer programmer in the accounting department of a company.\n\nIn 1975 James was a member of an early London proto-punk rock formation styling itself as The London S.S., along with Brian James (later of The Damned) and Mick Jones and Terry Chimes (both future members of The Clash).\n\nIn late 1976 James joined the new band Chelsea as its bassist, the group included William Broad (a member of the Bromley Contingent) on guitar, John Towe on drums and Gene October as its frontman/lead singer. After a few weeks and a handful of support gigs in London and Manchester, James and Broad parted company with Gene October over a lack of personal chemistry, which October reciprocated the sentiment of, and departed taking John Towe with them to form another new band which they named Generation X. Broad renamed himself with the performance punk pseudonym \"Billy Idol\" as he switched from the guitarist's role to be the singer/frontman on the recruitment of Bob \"Derwood\" Andrews as its lead guitarist. \n\nGeneration X played their first gigs in London in December 1976, and swiftly began writing their own material and playing live in venues around London and further afield. After five months Towe was dropped from the group's formation at James's instigation, and was replaced by the drummer Mark Laff, to complete the line-up that signed to Chrysalis Records and released the band's first single, \"Your Generation\" in September 1977, which entered the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. The band went on to release two long-players, the self-titled \"Generation X\" (1978) and \"Valley of the Dolls\" (1979), and several singles, all but one of which charted, and through a hectic touring schedule increasingly gained media recognition as one of the acts with a potentially bright commercial future that had emerged from the punk-rock scene. However, in early 1979 the band's internal cohesion began to come apart after the relative commercial failure of the \"Valley of the Dolls\" L.P., which had gone no higher than #51 in the U.K. Albums Chart, and disagreements arose within it about its future musical direction in London's post-punk landscape, the writing process and credits for its work, augmented by the appearance of personality clashes. These came to a head in late 1979 during the recording of what was the band's (unfinished) third long-player (retrospectively commercially released 20 years later the under the title \"Sweet Revenge)\". Generation X broke up in acrimony at the year's end with Andrews the lead guitarist quitting the act, and Idol and James asking its drummer Mark Laff to leave the band shortly afterwards over another disagreement.\n\nAfter abandoning the recording sessions at Olympic Studios, in early 1980 James and Idol re-launched the band in the New Romantic style, re-titled with the new name Gen X, with the drummer Terry Chimes. Re-recording some of the material from the abortive Olympic sessions, along with several new songs, at the beginning of 1981 it released a long-player entitled \"Kiss Me Deadly\", featuring session-playing from several different lead guitarists in the absence of a permanent one in the band's line-up. A small tour was also carried out to promote the new band with James Stevenson having been brought in as its stand-in guitarist. \"Kiss Me Deadly\" was a commercial failure on release, failing to enter in the U.K.'s Albums Chart, with its only single release \"Dancing with Myself\" also failing to enter the Top 40 Singles Chart; in consequence Chrysalis Records dropped the band's contract and the band broke up, with Idol leaving to pursue a solo career in the United States of America.\n\nIn 1981, after writing the single release \"Russian Roulette\" for the band The Lords of the New Church, playing on \"The London Cowboys'\" long-player \"Animal Pleasure\" and producing the long-player \"Song and Legend\" for the band \"Sex Gang Children\", James formed the rockabilly/cyberpunk act \"Sigue Sigue Sputnik\", which he wrote and performed with until 1989.\n\nIn 1990 James became the bassist with The Sisters of Mercy, recording with it on the \"Vision Thing\" album; he also played on the band's subsequent live tours, however he left the band the following year.\n\nOn 20 September 1993, during Billy Idol's \"No Religion\" Tour, James joined Generation X for a one-off reunion performance at the Astoria Theatre in London's West End.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2013 James worked with Mick Jones, his erstwhile associate from The London S.S. in the mid-1970s, in an act titled Carbon/Silicon, with James co-writing songs and playing guitar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the first black person to serve in the United States House of Representatives, the second black person (after Hiram Revels) to serve in the United States Congress and the first black presiding officer of the House of Representatives. Born into slavery in South Carolina, he was freed in the 1840s by his father purchasing the freedom of his entire family and himself. Revels and Rainey were both members of the Republican Party.\n\nJoseph Hayne Rainey was born into slavery in 1832 in Georgetown, South Carolina. He and his brother Edward were of mixed race; their mother Grace was of African and French descent, likely descended from slaves brought by refugees from Saint-Domingue during and after the revolution that created Haiti. Their father Edward Rainey, also enslaved, had been allowed by his master to work independently to earn money and developed a successful business as a barber; he paid a portion of his income to his master as required by law. Edward saved a substantial sum; by the 1840s he purchased his freedom and that of his wife and two sons. With education severely limited for black people, as an adult Rainey followed his father by becoming a barber; it was an independent and well-respected trade that enabled him to build a wide network in his community.\n\nIn 1859, Rainey went to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. There he met and married Susan, a free woman of color from the West Indies, who was also of African-French descent. They returned to South Carolina, where their three children were born: Joseph II, Herbert and Olivia.\n\nIn 1861, with the outbreak of the American Civil War, Rainey was among the free black people who were conscripted by the Confederates to work on fortifications in Charleston, South Carolina. He also worked as a cook and laborer on blockade runner ships.\n\nIn 1862, Rainey and his family escaped to Bermuda. They settled in St. George's, Bermuda town (from which Charleston and South Carolina had been founded in 1669 under Governor William Sayle), where Rainey worked as a barber, while his wife became a successful dressmaker with a shop. In 1865, the couple moved to the town of Hamilton when an outbreak of yellow fever threatened St. George's. Rainey worked at the Hamilton Hotel as a barber and a bartender, where his customers were mostly white. He became a respected member of the community. They made a prosperous life in Bermuda.\n\nIn 1866, following the civil war's end, Rainey and his family returned to South Carolina, where they settled in Charleston. In 1870, 43 percent of the city's population was African American, including many people of color who, like Rainey, had been free and held skilled jobs before the war. His experience and wealth helped establish him as a leader and he quickly became involved in politics, joining the executive committee of the state Republican Party. In 1868, he was a delegate to the state constitutional convention.\n\nIn 1870, Rainey was elected to the State Senate of South Carolina and became chair of the Finance Committee. He served only a short time as that year he won a special election as a Republican to fill a vacancy in the Forty-first Congress of the United States. This vacancy had been created when the House refused to seat Benjamin F. Whittemore, the incumbent. He had been censured by the House for corruption but re-elected.\n\nRainey was seated December 12, 1870 and was re-elected to Congress, serving a total of four terms. Serving until March 3, 1879, he established a record of length of service for a black Congressman that was not surpassed until that of William L. Dawson of Chicago in the 1950s. He supported legislation that became known as the Enforcement Acts, to suppress the violent activities of the Ku Klux Klan. This helped for a time, before white insurgents developed other paramilitary groups in the South, such as the White League and the Red Shirts.\n\nRainey made three speeches on the floor of Congress in support of what was finally passed as the Civil Rights Act of 1875. In 1873, he said he was not seeking 'social equality' and was content to choose his own circle.\n\nHe went on to say, \nBut we do want a law enacted that we may be recognized like other men in the country. Why is it that colored members of Congress cannot enjoy the same immunities that are accorded to white members? Why cannot we stop at hotels here without meeting objection? Why cannot we go into restaurants without being insulted? We are here enacting laws for the country and casting votes upon important questions; we have been sent here by the suffrages of the people, and why cannot we enjoy the same benefits that are accorded to our white colleagues on this floor?\n\nWith violence against black people increasing in the South, in 1874 Rainey purchased a \"summer home\" in Windsor, Connecticut. As a U.S. representative from South Carolina, Rainey could not use Windsor as his primary residence, but he moved his family there for their safety. While visiting, he became an active member of the First Church of Windsor. The \"Joseph H. Rainey House\", a c.1830 Greek Revival, is located at 299 Palisado Avenue (it is used as a private residence). It was designated as one of 130 stops on the Connecticut Freedom Trail, established in 1996 to highlight the achievements of African Americans in gaining freedom and civil rights.\n\nDuring his term in Congress, Rainey supported legislation to protect the civil rights of Southern black people, working for two years to gain passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1875. He also worked to promote the southern economy. In May 1874, Rainey became the first African American to preside over the House of Representatives as Speaker pro tempore.\n\nIn the closing hours of congress in 1878 Rainey was one of the fewer sober members present. He acted to ensure the passage of an $18 million civil service appropriation bill that would not have been passed without his firm presence.\n\nBeginning in 1874, paramilitary terrorist groups such as the Red Shirts in North and South Carolina and Louisiana had acted openly as the military arm of the Democratic Party to suppress black voting. In July 1876, six black people were murdered in the Hamburg Massacre and in October, at least 100 were killed by white paramilitary groups in several days of violence in Ellenton, both in contested Aiken County, South Carolina.\n\nIn 1876, Rainey won re-election from the Charleston district against Democratic candidate John Smythe Richardson. Richardson challenged the result as invalid on the grounds of intimidation of Democrats by federal soldiers and black militias guarding the polls, but Rainey retained his seat. The 1876 election was marked by widespread fraud in the state. For instance, votes counted in the upland Edgefield County for the Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wade Hampton III exceeded by 2,000 the total number of registered voters in the county; similar results were counted in Laurens County. That year Democrats ultimately took control of the state government, and the next year the federal government withdrew its troops from the South as part of a national compromise; Reconstruction was ended.\n\nIn mid-1878 Rainey warned President Hayes of increasing violence and rhetoric meant to limit the African-American vote in South Carolina.\n\nIn 1878, Rainey was defeated in a second contest with Richardson, although black men continued to be elected for numerous local offices through much of the 19th century. White Democrats used their dominance of the state legislature to pass laws for segregation, Jim Crow and making voter registration more difficult, effectively disenfranchising black people. In 1895 they passed a new state constitution, that completed the disenfranchisement of most black people, stripping them of political power and excluding them from the political process for the next several decades into the 1960s.\n\nAfter leaving the U.S. Congress, Rainey was appointed as a federal agent of the US Treasury Department for internal revenue in South Carolina. He held this position for two years, after which he began a career in private commerce. He worked in brokerage and banking in Washington, DC for five years.\n\nRainey retired in 1886 and returned to South Carolina. He died the following year in Georgetown, the city of his birth.\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

He wrote about the Dead Sea Scrolls and ancient works in Aramaic such as the Targumim, and on the life and religion of Jesus. He was one of the most important voices in contemporary Jesus research, and he has been described as the greatest Jesus scholar of his time. Vermes' written work on Jesus focuses principally on Jesus the Jew, as seen in the broader context of the narrative scope of Jewish history and theology, while questioning and challenging the basis of the Christian doctrine on Jesus.\n\nVermes was born in Makó, Hungary, in 1924 to parents of Jewish descent, Terézia Riesz, a schoolteacher, and Ernő Vermes, a liberal journalist. The Vermes family was of Jewish background but had given up religious practice in the mid-19th century. All three were baptised as Roman Catholics when he was six; referring to his parents' conversion, he defined it as a way to escape from the rising tide of anti-Semitism in Europe. In an interview with Rachel Kohn of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 1999 he stated: \"In fact, I never was anything but a Jew with a temporary sort of outer vestment. I realized I ought to recognize my genuine identity.\" Nonetheless, his mother and father died in the Holocaust in 1944.\n\nVermes attended a Catholic seminary. When he was eligible for college, in 1942, Jews were not accepted into Hungarian universities. After the Second World War he became a Roman Catholic priest, but was not admitted into the Jesuit or Dominican orders because of his Jewish ancestry. Vermes was accepted into the Order of the Fathers of Notre-Dame de Sion, a French-Belgian order which prayed for the Jews. Later he moved to Paris, where he studied under the eminent French Jewish scholar Georges Vajda, a graduate of the Rabbinical Seminary of Budapest.\n\nHe studied then at the College St Albert and the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, where he specialized in Oriental history and languages. In 1953 Vermes obtained a doctorate in theology with the first dissertation written on the Dead Sea Scrolls and its historical framework. In 1962 he completed a first translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls, later revised and much augmented. Also in Paris, Vermes befriended and worked with Paul Demann, a scholar, like him, of Hungarian Jewish origins. Together with a third collaborator, Renee Bloch, they battled doggedly against the anti-Semitic content in Catholic education and ritual of the time. The Second Vatican Council would later accept many of the trio's theological arguments.\n\nAfter researching the scrolls in Paris for several years, Vermes had met Pamela Hobson Curle, a poet and scholar, disciple of the Neo-Hasidic Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, and the two fell in love. She was married and the mother of two children, but her marriage was in the process of ending. In 1958, after her divorce, and after Vermes left the priesthood, they married, remaining together and often collaborating on work, until her death in 1993. He also renounced Christianity and re-embraced his Jewish identity, although not religious observance. He took up a teaching post at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nIn 1965, after teaching Biblical Hebrew for several years at Newcastle University in the north of England, he joined the Faculty of Oriental Studies at Oxford University, rising to become the first professor of Jewish Studies before his retirement in 1991; he subsequently directed the Oxford Forum for Qumran Research at the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies. In 1970 he reconverted to Judaism as a liberal Jew, and became a member of the Liberal Jewish Synagogue of London. After the death of his first wife in 1993, he married Margaret Unarska in 1996 and adopted her son, Ian. Vermes died on 8 May 2013 at the age of 88.\n\nVermes was one of the first scholars to examine the Dead Sea Scrolls after their discovery in 1947, and is the author of the standard translation into English of the Dead Sea Scrolls: \"The Dead Sea Scrolls in English\" (1962). He is one of the leading scholars in the field of the study of the historical Jesus (see Selected Publications, below) and together with Fergus Millar and Martin Goodman, Vermes was responsible for substantially revising Emil Schurer's three-volume work, \"The History of the Jewish People in the Age of Jesus Christ\", His \"An Introduction to the Complete Dead Sea Scrolls,\" revised edition (2000), is a study of the collection at Qumran.\n\nUntil his death, he was a Professor Emeritus of Jewish Studies and Emeritus Fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford, but continued to teach at the Oriental Institute in Oxford. He had edited the \"Journal of Jewish Studies\" from 1971 to his death, and from 1991 he had been director of the Oxford Forum for Qumran Research at the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies. He inspired the creation of the British Association for Jewish Studies (BAJS) in 1975 and of the European Association for Jewish Studies (EAJS) in 1981 and acted as founding president for both.\n\nVermes was a Fellow of the British Academy; a Fellow of the European Academy of Arts, Sciences and Humanities; holder of an Oxford D. Litt. (1988) and of honorary doctorates from the University of Edinburgh (1989), University of Durham (1990), University of Sheffield (1994) and the Central European University of Budapest (2008). He was awarded the Wilhelm Bacher Memorial Medal by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1996), the Memorial Medal of the city of Makó, his place of birth (2008) and the keys of the cities of Monroe LA and Natchez MS (2009). He received a vote of congratulation from the US House of Representatives, proposed by the Representative of Louisiana on 17 September 2009.\n\nIn the course of a lecture tour in the United States in September 2009, Vermes spoke at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, at Duke University in Durham NC, at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore MD, and at the University of Louisiana at Monroe and at Baton Rouge.\n\nOn 23 January 2012 Penguin Books celebrated at Wolfson College, Oxford, the golden jubilee of Vermes's \"The Dead Sea Scrolls in English\", which has sold an estimated half-a-million copies worldwide. A \"Fiftieth anniversary\" edition has been issued in the Penguin Classics series.\n\nVermes was a prominent scholar in the contemporary field of historical Jesus research. The contemporary approach, known as the \"third quest\", emphasizes Jesus' Jewish identity and context. It portrays Jesus as founding a renewal movement within Judaism.\n\nVermes described Jesus as a 1st-century Jewish holy man, a commonplace view in academia but novel to the public when Vermes began publishing. Contrary to certain other scholars (such as E. P. Sanders), Vermes concludes that Jesus did not reach out to non-Jews. For example, he attributes positive references to Samaritans in the gospels not to Jesus himself but to early Christian editing. He suggests that, properly understood, the historical Jesus is a figure that Jews should find familiar and attractive. This historical Jesus, however, is so different from the Christ of faith that Christians, says Vermes, may well want to rethink the fundamentals of their faith.\n\nImportant works on this topic include \"Jesus the Jew\" (1973), which describes Jesus as a thoroughly Jewish Galilean charismatic, \"The Gospel of Jesus the Jew\" (1981), which examines Jewish parallels to Jesus' teaching and \"Christian Beginnings\" (2012), which traces the evolution of the figure of Jesus from Jewish charismatic in the synoptic Gospels to equality with God in the Council of Nicea (325 CE). He also expounded this theme in the controversial television miniseries, \"\" (Channel 4: 1984).\n\nVermes believed it is possible \"to retrieve the authentic Gospel of Jesus, his first-hand message to his original followers.\"\n\nThe historical Jesus can be retrieved only within the context of first-century Galilean Judaism. The Gospel image must therefore be inserted into the historical canvas of Palestine in the first century CE, with the help of the works of Flavius Josephus, the Dead Sea Scrolls and early rabbinic literature. Against this background, what kind of picture of Jesus emerges from the Gospels? That of a rural holy man, initially a follower of the movement of repentance launched by another holy man, John the Baptist. In the hamlets and villages of Lower Galilee and the lakeside, Jesus set out to preach the coming of the Kingdom of God within the lifetime of his generation and outlined the religious duties his simple listeners were to perform to prepare themselves for the great event.\n\nFor more details see his autobiography, \"Providential Accidents\", London, SCM Press, 1998 ; Rowman & Littlefield, Lanham MD, 1998 .\n\n"}
{"id": "1958221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958221", "title": "Washington State Capitol", "text": "Washington State Capitol\n\nThe Washington State Capitol or \"Legislative Building\" in Olympia is the home of the government of the state of Washington. It contains chambers for the Washington State Legislature and offices for the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state and treasurer and is part of a campus consisting of several buildings. Buildings for the Washington Supreme Court, executive agencies and the Washington Governor's Mansion are part of the capitol campus.\n\nAfter Olympia became capital city of the Washington Territory in 1853, the city's founder, Edmund Sylvester, gave the legislature of land upon which to build the capitol, located on a hill overlooking what is now known as Capitol Lake. A two-story wood-frame building was constructed on the site, where the legislature met starting in 1854. When President Benjamin Harrison approved Washington's state constitution in 1889, he donated of federal lands to the state with the stipulation that income from the lands was to be used solely for construction of the state capitol.\n\nThe legislature formed the State Capitol Commission in 1893 to oversee the creation of a new capitol on the property in Olympia. The commission had a nationwide competition to find an architect and chose the submission of Ernest Flagg. Construction began on Flagg's plan, but was soon stalled by poor economic conditions with only the foundation completed. When the legislature finally approved an appropriation of additional funds in 1897, newly elected Governor John Rogers vetoed it. Rogers advocated the purchase of the existing Thurston County Courthouse in downtown Olympia, now known as the \"Old Capitol\" and home to the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction. The legislature approved the new location and began meeting there in 1905.\n\nThe courthouse became the location of all agencies of the state government and within a few years the legislature decided the building was too small and a new State Capitol Commission convened in 1911. This time, the commission was interested in constructing a group of buildings to serve as the capitol rather than a single facility and selected the design submitted by the company Walter Wilder and Harry White. Wilder and White's designs were influenced by the Olmsted brothers who served as consultants from 1911 to 1912 and designed and supervised the landscaping for the campus from 1927 to 1931. Construction of the campus began in 1912, and the Temple of Justice was completed in 1920, followed by the Insurance Building and the power and heating plant. After multiple revisions of the plans, the Legislative Building was completed in 1928. Additional buildings on the campus were constructed during the next several decades.\n\nThe Capitol Campus was placed on the National Register of Historic Districts in 1974 and contains or contributes to some of the most valued views in the State including the Olympic Mountains, Puget Sound, Mt. Rainier, the Capitol Dome and the Capitol Group of buildings on the hill. The design of the Capitol Campus is a grand example of the City Beautiful style of the Progressive era of the early 20th Century\n\nLocated on the campus are the Legislative Building, Temple of Justice, John A. Cherberg Senate office building, Irv Newhouse Senate office building, Insurance Building, John L. O'Brien House office building, Joel M. Pritchard Building, and several other office buildings. The Capitol Conservatory, built in 1939 by the Works Progress Administration, housed various types of flora until it was permanently closed on September 5, 2008. The campus also hosts many veterans' memorials.\n\nThe state seal, which is featured throughout the buildings on the state flag, tapestries, railing, door handles and elsewhere, was designed by Olympia Jeweler Charles Talcot by making two circles and putting a two-cent stamp of George Washington in the middle. There is even a bronze version of the seal in the floor of the rotunda. Over time, George Washington's nose has worn down due to foot traffic on it and it is now roped-off to prevent further damage.\n\nThe Legislative Building houses the chambers of the Washington State Legislature and offices of several elected officials. This building is the dominant feature of the capitol grounds, with its dome high, making it the tallest self-supporting masonry dome in the United States, and fifth tallest in the world, surpassed only by St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, St. Paul's Cathedral in London, Global Vipassana Pagoda in Mumbai, and Santa Maria Del Fiore in Florence. A number of features in the structure commemorating Washington's addition to the Union as the 42nd state—42 steps lead to the building's North entrance and one of the four 42-star flags owned by the state is displayed in the State Reception Room. Flags with this number of stars were never official because of the admission of Idaho shortly after Washington.\n\nThe building has a rectangular footprint and is constructed of brick and concrete and faced on the exterior with limestone quarried from Wilkeson, Washington. The structure consists of four floors with the dome at the center that reaches a height of on the exterior and from the floor. The first floor is within the raised base and houses offices. The second and third floors are surrounded by Doric columns and capped with a cornice that encircles the building. The fourth floor is covered with a gabled roof that is situated behind the cornice on the third floor. On the north facade, the entrance is in a portico framed by eight Corinthian columns reached by 42 granite steps. A similar portico is on the south facade but it covers a vehicle ramp to the lower level instead of steps. The dome is surrounded by four small sandstone domes and capped by a lantern and lightning rod. The floors and many interior walls are covered by Alaskan marble and marble from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy are used in other parts of the interior.\n\nAll lamps and Roman fire pots in the rotunda were made by Louis Comfort Tiffany, son of Charles Lewis Tiffany, founder of Tiffany and Company. These comprise the largest collection of Tiffany bronze in the world and Tiffany's last large commission before his death in 1933. The chandelier above the rotunda is suspended above the floor by a chain and measures tall. It could fit a full-size Volkswagen Beetle if put in sideways and features life-size faces, human figures, and 202 lights.\n\nThe Legislative Building is also home to a large brass bust of George Washington. Over time, the nose on the bust has become shiny from visitors rubbing it for good luck.\n\nFacing the Legislative Building is the Temple of Justice, home to the State Supreme Court and the State Law Library. Until 1924, the unused boiler and coal rooms located under the Temple of Justice housed the Division of Highways Testing Laboratory, which would later become the Department of Transportation Materials Laboratory.\n\nThe Governor's Mansion is located immediately west of the Legislative Building. Built before the rest of the capitol campus in 1908, the four-story Georgian-style mansion was intended as a temporary structure, and over the years the state legislature has considered replacing it with an office building or a new mansion. The legislature decided to renovate and remodel the existing building in 1973, and since then the private, non-profit Governor's Mansion Foundation has maintained it.\n\nThere are 18 major art installations and monuments on the campus. The \"Winged Victory\" monument, commemorating World War I, is one of the most prominent. Sculpted by Alonzo Victor Lewis from bronze, its granite pedestal has four inscriptions. Dedicated May 30, 1938, the monument has been restored numerous times since then. The Tivoli Fountain replica was designed by the architects Wohleb, Wohleb, and Bennett. Inscribed upon it is \"Replica of the Tivoli Fountain—Tivoli Park, Copenhagen, Denmark. Presented to the State of Washington by Olympia-Tumwater Foundation. Peter G. Schmidt, President. 1953.\" Other points of interest include World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, medal of honor, POW–MIA, and law enforcement memorials; Arc of Statehood; \"Boiler Works\"; Du Pen Fountain; \"Mysteries of Life\"; \"Sea to Sky\"; \"The Shaman\"; an untitled sculpture by Lee Kelly (1973); Territorial Sundial; the Water Garden; and \"Woman Dancing\". General George Washington, a colossal portrait by Avard Fairbanks, is placed in the reception room (another is installed at Washington University Medical School in Washington, D.C.).\n\nThree major earthquakes have affected the capital since its construction. The first, in 1949, damaged the cupola of the Legislative Building's dome so badly it had to be completely replaced. A 6.5 magnitude earthquake in 1965 had even worse results, with the dome's brick buttresses left in such poor condition that a major aftershock could have caused them to collapse entirely, according to a state report. The state performed work after both earthquakes to reduce the impact of future occurrences, and performed additional seismic improvements in 1975. The Nisqually earthquake of 2001 caused further damage, including a splintered buttress, but the earthquake-resistance work prevented more serious harm to the building.\n\nWilder and White's designs for the dome, weighing 26,000 metric tons, called for the dome to be fixed to its supporting structures by gravity instead of by any bolts or fasteners. During an earthquake, the dome could shift, along with the sandstone columns supporting it. The columns moved as much as three inches (76 mm) during the Nisqually earthquake. Renovations completed in 2004 by Design Company EYP Architecture & Engineering fixed the dome permanently to the rest of the building.\n\nBecause the Capitol grounds are outside the normal jurisdiction of Olympia and Thurston County, the sheriff and city police do not investigate crime on the Capitol campus. The Washington State Patrol is responsible for law enforcement and investigations on the Capitol grounds as well as at the Old Capitol Building and adjoining Sylvester Park in downtown Olympia. The Senate and House also have their own security staff.\n\nAfter the September 11th attacks, there had been a security checkpoint at the entrance to the Capitol building, complete with magnetometer and x-ray machine, but security has since reverted to its original state. The Capitol is one of the few in the country, along with Texas and Kentucky, with no restrictions on carrying firearms.\n\nIn December 2008, an atheist sign was displayed adjacent to a nativity scene in the State Capitol as part of a Christmas display causing widespread media coverage and controversy. The sign was stolen, but eventually found and returned to the Capitol. There was a rapid influx of requests from individuals and groups wanting to display other material, including a Festivus pole and a request by the Westboro Baptist Church to display a sign saying (among other things) \"Santa Claus will take you to hell.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1958222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958222", "title": "Amyloid beta", "text": "Amyloid beta\n\nAmyloid beta (Aβ or Abeta) denotes peptides of 36–43 amino acids that are crucially involved in Alzheimer's disease as the main component of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. The peptides derive from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is cleaved by beta secretase and gamma secretase to yield Aβ. Aβ molecules can aggregate to form flexible soluble oligomers which may exist in several forms. It is now believed that certain misfolded oligomers (known as \"seeds\") can induce other Aβ molecules to also take the misfolded oligomeric form, leading to a chain reaction akin to a prion infection. The oligomers are toxic to nerve cells. The other protein implicated in Alzheimer's disease, tau protein, also forms such prion-like misfolded oligomers, and there is some evidence that misfolded Aβ can induce tau to misfold.\n\nA recent study suggested that APP and its amyloid potential is of ancient origins, dating as far back as early deuterostomes.\n\nThe normal function of Aβ is not well understood. Though some animal studies have shown that the absence of Aβ does not lead to any obvious loss of physiological function, several potential activities have been discovered for Aβ, including activation of kinase enzymes, protection against oxidative stress, regulation of cholesterol transport, functioning as a transcription factor, and anti-microbial activity (potentially associated with Aβ's pro-inflammatory activity).\n\nThe glymphatic system clears metabolic waste from the mammalian brain, and in particular beta amyloids. Indeed, a number of proteases have been implicated by both genetic and biochemical studies as being responsible for the recognition and degradation of beta amyloids; these include insulin degrading enzyme. and presequence protease The rate of removal is significantly increased during sleep. However, the significance of the lymphatic system in Aβ clearance in Alzheimer's disease is unknown.\n\nAβ is the main component of amyloid plaques (extracellular deposits found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease). Similar plaques appear in some variants of Lewy body dementia and in inclusion body myositis (a muscle disease), while Aβ can also form the aggregates that coat cerebral blood vessels in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The plaques are composed of a tangle of regularly ordered fibrillar aggregates called amyloid fibers, a protein fold shared by other peptides such as the prions associated with protein misfolding diseases.\n\nResearch suggests that soluble oligomeric forms of the peptide may be causative agents in the development of Alzheimer's disease. It is generally believed that Aβ oligomers are the most toxic. The ion channel hypothesis postulates that oligomers of soluble, non-fibrillar Aβ form membrane ion channels allowing the unregulated calcium influx into neurons that underlies disrupted calcium ion homeostasis and apoptosis seen in Alzheimer's disease. Computational studies have demonstrated that also Aβ peptides embedded into the membrane as monomers with predominant helical configuration, can oligomerize and eventually form channels whose stability and conformation are sensitively correlated to the concomitant presence and arrangement of cholesterol. A number of genetic, cell biology, biochemical and animal studies support the concept that Aβ plays a central role in the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology.\n\nBrain Aβ is elevated in patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Aβ is the main constituent of brain parenchymal and vascular amyloid; it contributes to cerebrovascular lesions and is neurotoxic. It is unresolved how Aβ accumulates in the central nervous system and subsequently initiates the disease of cells. Some researchers have found that the Aβ oligomers induce some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease by competing with insulin for binding sites on the insulin receptor, thus impairing glucose metabolism in the brain. Significant efforts have been focused on the mechanisms responsible for Aβ production, including the proteolytic enzymes gamma- and β-secretases which generate Aβ from its precursor protein, APP (amyloid precursor protein). Aβ circulates in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain interstitial fluid (ISF) mainly as soluble Aβ40 Senile plaques contain both Aβ40 and Aβ42, while vascular amyloid is predominantly the shorter Aβ40. Several sequences of Aβ were found in both lesions. Generation of Aβ in the central nervous system may take place in the neuronal axonal membranes after APP-mediated axonal transport of β-secretase and presenilin-1.\n\nIncreases in either total Aβ levels or the relative concentration of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 (where the former is more concentrated in cerebrovascular plaques and the latter in neuritic plaques) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Due to its more hydrophobic nature, the Aβ42 is the most amyloidogenic form of the peptide. However the central sequence KLVFFAE is known to form amyloid on its own, and probably forms the core of the fibril. One study further correlated Aβ42 levels in the brain not only with onset of Alzheimer's disease, but also reduced cerebrospinal fluid pressure, suggesting that a build-up or inability to clear Aβ42 fragments may play a role into the pathology.\n\nThe \"amyloid hypothesis\", that the plaques are responsible for the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, is accepted by the majority of researchers but is not conclusively established. An alternative hypothesis is that amyloid oligomers rather than plaques are responsible for the disease. Mice that are genetically engineered to express oligomers but not plaques (APP) develop the disease. Furthermore, mice that are in addition engineered to convert oligomers into plaques (APP X PS1ΔE9), are no more impaired than the oligomer only mice. Intra-cellular deposits of tau protein are also seen in the disease, and may also be implicated, as has aggregation of alpha synuclein.\n\nWhile Aβ has been implicated in cancer development, prompting studies on a variety of cancers to elucidate the nature of its possible effects, results are largely inconclusive. Aβ levels have been assessed in relation to a number of cancers, including esophageal, colorectal, lung, and hepatic, in response to observed reductions in risk for developing Alzheimer's disease in survivors of these cancers. All cancers were shown to be associated positively with increased Aβ levels, particularly hepatic cancers. This direction of association however has not yet been established. Studies focusing on human breast cancer cell lines have further demonstrated that these cancerous cells display an increased level of expression of amyloid precursor protein.\n\nAdults with Down syndrome had accumulation of amyloid in association with evidence of Alzheimer's disease, including declines in cognitive functioning, memory, fine motor movements, executive functioning, and visuospatial skills.\n\nAβ is formed after sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane glycoprotein of undetermined function. APP can be cleaved by the proteolytic enzymes α-, β- and γ-secretase; Aβ protein is generated by successive action of the β and γ secretases. The γ secretase, which produces the C-terminal end of the Aβ peptide, cleaves within the transmembrane region of APP and can generate a number of isoforms of 30-51 amino acid residues in length. The most common isoforms are Aβ and Aβ; the longer form is typically produced by cleavage that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, while the shorter form is produced by cleavage in the trans-Golgi network.\n\nAutosomal-dominant mutations in APP cause hereditary early-onset Alzheimer's disease (familial AD). This form of AD accounts for no more than 10% of all cases, and the vast majority of AD is not accompanied by such mutations. However, familial Alzheimer's disease is likely to result from altered proteolytic processing.\n\nThe gene for the amyloid precursor protein is located on chromosome 21, and accordingly people with Down syndrome have a very high incidence of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAmyloid beta is commonly thought to be intrinsically unstructured, meaning that in solution it does not acquire a unique tertiary fold but rather populates a set of structures. As such, it cannot be crystallized and most structural knowledge on amyloid beta comes from NMR and molecular dynamics. Early NMR-derived models of a 26-aminoacid polypeptide from amyloid beta (Aβ 10-35) show a collapsed coil structure devoid of significant secondary structure content. However, the most recent (2012) NMR structure of (Aβ 1-40) has significant secondary and tertiary structure. Replica exchange molecular dynamics studies suggested that amyloid beta can indeed populate multiple discrete structural states; more recent studies identified a multiplicity of discrete conformational clusters by statistical analysis. By NMR-guided simulations, amyloid beta 1-40 and amyloid beta 1-42 also seem to feature highly different conformational states, with the C-terminus of amyloid beta 1-42 being more structured than that of the 1-40 fragment.\n\nLow-temperature and low-salt conditions allowed to isolate pentameric disc-shaped oligomers devoid of beta structure. In contrast, soluble oligomers prepared in the presence of detergents seem to feature substantial beta sheet content with mixed parallel and antiparallel character, different from fibrils; computational studies suggest an antiparallel beta-turn-beta motif instead for membrane-embedded oligomers.\n\nThe suggested mechanisms by which amyloid beta may damage and cause neuronal death include the generation of reactive oxygen species during the process of its self-aggregation. When this occurs on the membrane of neurons in vitro, it causes lipid peroxidation and the generation of a toxic aldehyde called 4-hydroxynonenal which, in turn, impairs the function of ion-motive ATPases, glucose transporters and glutamate transporters. As a result, amyloid beta promotes depolarization of the synaptic membrane, excessive calcium influx and mitochondrial impairment. Aggregations of the amyloid-beta peptide disrupt membranes in vitro.\n\nResearchers in Alzheimer's disease have identified several strategies as possible interventions against amyloid:\n\n\nβ- and γ-secretase are responsible for the generation of Aβ from the release of the intracellular domain of APP, meaning that compounds that can partially inhibit the activity of either β- and γ-secretase are highly sought after. In order to initiate partial inhibition of β- and γ-secretase, a compound is needed that can block the large active site of aspartyl proteases while still being capable of bypassing the blood-brain barrier. To date, human testing has been avoided due to concern that it might interfere with signaling via Notch proteins and other cell surface receptors.\n\n\nImaging compounds, notably Pittsburgh compound B, (6-OH-BTA-1, a thioflavin), can selectively bind to amyloid beta in vitro and in vivo. This technique, combined with PET imaging, is used to image areas of plaque deposits in Alzheimer's patients.\n\nAmyloid beta can be measured semiquantitatively with immunostaining, which also allows one to determine location. Amyloid beta may be primarily vascular, as in cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or in senile plaques in white matter.\n\nOne sensitive method is ELISA which is an immunosorbent assay which utilizes a pair of antibodies that recognize amyloid beta.\n\nAtomic force microscopy, which can visualize nanoscale molecular surfaces, can be used to determine the aggregation state of amyloid beta in vitro.\n\nDual polarisation interferometry is an optical technique which can measure early stages of aggregation by measuring the molecular size and densities as the fibrils elongate. These aggregate processes can also be studied on lipid bilayer constructs.\n\n"}

Her other major hits opposite Prosenjit include \"Abujh Mon\" (1996), \"Moner Manush\" (1997), \"Pabitra Papi\" (1997), \"Baba Keno Chakar\" (1998), \"Daay Dayitwa\" (1999), \"Sindur Khela\" (1999), \"Sudhu Ekbar Bolo\" (1999), \"Tumi Ele Tai\" (1999), \"Sasurbari Zindabad\" (2000) and \"Praktan\" (2016). Her first collaboration with Chiranjeet was Prashant Nanda's \"Lal Paan Bibi\" (1994) which was also a major financial success. Her other hits opposite Chiranjeet include \"Naginkanya\" (1995), \"Rakhal Raja\" (1995), \"Sansar Sangram\" (1995), \"Chandragrahan\" (1997), \"Bishnu Narayan\" (1998), \"Sindur Khela\" (1999), \"Bastir Meye Radha\" (2000) and \"Hatiyar\" (2001). She teamed up with Manna for the first time in Sharif Uddin Khan Dipu's commercially successful Bangladeshi film \"Desh Dorodi\" (1998). Her other hits with Manna include \"Killer\" (2000), \"Shesh Juddho\" (2000), \"Jummon Koshai\", \"Eri Naam Bhalobasa\", \"Ranangan\" (2004), \"Swami Chintai\" (2006). She received critical acclaim for her roles in films such as \"Dahan\" (1997), \"Utsab\" (2000), \"Paromitar Ek Din\" (2000) and \"Chaturanga\" (2008).\n\nRituparna was interested in the arts since a young age and learned painting, dancing, singing and handicrafts at a painting school, called \"Chitrangshu\". She studied at Carmel High school, and later graduated in History from Lady Brabourne College. She began studying Modern History for an M.A. at University of Calcutta, but had to interrupt studies to concentrate on her career as an actress.\n\nSengupta made her screen debut opposite Kushal Chakraborty in the Bengali fantasy TV series \"Shwet Kapot\" (1989) broadcast on DD Bangla. Chakraborty's sister Anindita was her classmate. After her Secondary Examination, she was insisted by Anindita to appear for a screen test for a role opposite Chakraborty in the TV series. The work was an adaptation of the Danish fairy tale The White Dove. She had to play an imprisoned princess shapeshifting into a white dove who falls in love with an imprisoned prince played by Chakraborty. Initially her father made objection against her pursuing the role but then gave his consent since the role demanded two-day shoot. Due to Chakraborty's stardom, the sitcom grabbed the attention of media personalities. She was soon offered a few roles in several other Bengali TV series but those never took off her career.\n\nAfter Gargi Roychowdhury declined the role of Titli opposite Bhaskar Banerjee in Prabhat Roy's National Award winning Bengali film \"Shwet Pathorer Thala\" (1992), Sengupta was offered to play the character. She featured opposite Prosenjit Chatterjee in Bhijoy Bhaskar's \"Nag Panchami\" (1994) and Chiranjeet Chakraborty in Prashanta Nanda's \"Laal Paan Bibi\" (1994). Since both the films worked at the box office, producers and directors approached her with meaty roles opposite Chatterjee and Chakraborty. Sengupta made her Bollywood debut opposite Chunkey Pandey in Partho Ghosh's thriller \"Teesra Kaun\" (1994) which was a debacle at the box office.\n\nSengupta bagged the female lead in Swapan Saha's \"Sujan Sakhi\" (1995) alongside Abhishek Chatterjee essaying the male lead. The film was a remake of Khan Ataur Rahman's \"Sujon Sokhi\" (1975). The film was a major success at the box office. She featured opposite Chiranjeet Chakraborty in the latter's directorial venture \"Sansar Sangram\" (1995). The film retaining a highly melodramatic approach appeased the rural audience of West Bengal. She featured opposite Mithun Chakraborty in Raghuram's \"Bhagya Debata\" (1995). The film was a major financial success. She featured in Zee's home-production \"Mohini\" (1995), directed by Hema Malini. The telefilm stars Madhu and Sudesh Berry as the protagonists.\n\nSengupta hit the pinnacle of her professional rivalry with Satabdi Roy in the late 1990s since the two were offered most of the female leads opposite Prosenjit Chatterjee after Debashree Roy vowed not to work with Chatterjee any longer. She featured opposite Chatterjee in a string of commercially successful Bengali films such as \"Abujh Mon\" (1996), \"Matir Manush\" (1997), \"Mayar Badhon\" (1997), \"Moner Manush\" (1997), \"Pabitra Papi\" (1997), \"Samadhan\" (1997), \"Tomake Chai\" (1997), \"Baba Keno Chakar\" (1998), \"Praner Cheye Priyo\" (1998), \"Daay Dayitwa\" (1999), \"Madhu Malati\" (1999), \"Sindur Khela\" (1999), \"Sudhu Ekbar Bolo\" (1999), \"Tumi Ele Tai\" (1999), \"Aasroy\" (2000), \"Madhur Milan\" (2000) and \"Sasurbari Zindabad\" (2000) to name a few.\n\nSome of her hits in Bangladeshi cinema include \"Sagarika\" (1998), \"Tomar Amar Prem\" (1998), \"Ranga Bou\" (1999).\n\nShe featured in Aparna Sen's \"Paromitar Ek Din\" (2000).\nAfter her fallout with Prosenjit Chatterjee, she found herself in a very debilitating state.\n\nSwapan Saha cast Sengupta alongside Abhishek Chatterjee, Tapas Paul and Satabdi Roy in his family drama \"Sukh Dukkher Sansar\" (2003). The film was financial success.\n\nIn 2004, Sengupta had 12 releases in Bengali cinema, all of which became box office debacles generating the common notion among the filmmakers that the actress had lost her market value. Sengupta starred in Sushanta Saha's \"Sagar Kinare\" (2004) where she shared silver screen with Debashree Roy for the first time. She featured opposite Rajpal Yadav in Chandan Arora's critically acclaimed \"Main, Meri Patni Aur Woh\" (2005). She featured alongside Satabdi Roy and Koel Mallick in Raja Sen's \"Devipaksha\" (2004).\n\nSengupta appeared in a host of films between 2008 and 2011, but only very few of those were commercially or critically successful. She starred as Damini in Suman Mukhopadhyay's \"Chaturanga\" (2008) which was the film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Rabindranath Tagore. The Times of India wrote that it was her best performance till date. The film failed to achieve commercial success. She accepted the role of a woman suffering from a turbulent conjugal relationship in \"Mahanagar@Kolkata\" (2010). She featured in Anjan Das' critically and commercially unsuccessful film \"Bedeni\" (2011).\n\nSengupta, in 2012 met box office success with two of her releases — \"Charulata 2011\" and \"Muktodhra\". She featured opposite Tapas Paul in Satabdi Roy's \"Om Shanti\" (2012) that also stars Rakhi Sawant in a dance number. Sengupta skipped the premier show of the film as she felt that Sawant had been given more preference than her in the poster of the film while Roy said that Sengupta's grievance was illogical. Sengupta later said that she regretted doing the role. The film received negative review. It was a major financial disaster.\n\nSengupta featured in Ratul Ganguly's \"10th July\" (2014). The film failed to achieve critical favour and became a box office debacle.\n\nShe featured as Begum Jaan in Srijit Mukherji's \"Rajkahini\" (2015) and met box office success. Her character in the film is that of an aged prostitute who runs a brothel housing eleven women. The Times of India detected that Sengupta failed to land the coarseness of a rustic prostitute perfectly. News18 India appreciated her performance but deprecated her dubbing to be \"a very forced husky baritone.\"\nShe featured opposite Prosenjit Chatterjee in \"Praktan\" (2016).\n\nThe poster for the Amitabh Bhattacharjee starrer jatra, \"Ekaler Karnaarjun\" (2017) claimed Sengupta to be the director. Sengupta negated that it was a misrepresentation while Indrajit Chakraborty, another actor of that jatra claimed that she was the guest director. She featured alongside Roopa Ganguly and Indrani Haldar in \"Aaro Ekbar\" (2017). Her \"Baranda\" (2017) was commercial disaster.\n\nShe won critical favour for her role as Chandrima Mukherjee in Prakash Bharadwaj's \"Colours of Life\" (2018). She featured as Sohini in Agnidev Chatterjee's \"Gaheen Hriday\" (2018) alongside Kaushik Sen playing Anupam. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Suchitra Bhattacharya. Her performance in the film was appreciated by critics. In Kamaleshwar Mukherjee's \"Goodnight City\" (2018) she featured as psychiatrist Abhiri Chatterjee who implores her husband who is a deputy commissioner with the detective department, not to be hard on the protagonist, a murderer whom she believes to be a psychologically distraught person. Her performance failed to win critical favour. The Times of India wrote on her performance, \"she shows the compassionate side of her character nicely, the unemotional and professional psychiatrist goes missing every now and then.\" The film became another box office debacle. She played Kabita, an actress in Alamgir's \"Ekti Cinemar Golpo\" (2018). Viewers disliked her romantic collaboration with Arifin Shuvoo who is almost 15 years younger than her. Her performance in the film was deprecated by critics. The film became a major financial disaster.\n\nShe featured as a psychiatrist in Pritha Chakraborty's \"Mukherjee Dar Bou\" (2019). She had a fallout with the director of the film since the latter never fell into her suggestion to increase her screen time. The film turned out to be a major box office success. In Reshmi Mitra's \"Lime N Light\" (2019) she enacted double roles of Sreemoyee Sen, an actress and Archana Saha, a junior artiste. The junior artiste who is a lookalike of Sreemoyee Sen, takes her place after the latter met an accident. The Times of India wrote on her performance, \"She is convincing as the naive Archana and confident as the superstar Sreemoyee.\" The film failed to draw viewers to the hall.\n\nShe married her childhood friend Sanjay Chakrabarti, founder and CEO of MobiApps on 13 December 1999 in Munshigonj and the couple has a son named Ankan and a daughter named Rishona Niya.\n\nSengupta has a deferential attitude to Debashree Roy whereas her attitude towards Satabdi Roy is oscillating. The relationship between the two got sour during the shooting of Prashanta Nanda's \"Laal Paan Bibi\" (1994) when Sengupta literally broke drown into tears after she was denounced for coming late to the set of the film, by Roy who was the bigger star by then. Roy cast Sengupta as the female lead in her directorial venture \"Om Shanti\" (2012). Both the actresses were interrogated whether their professional rivalry would affect the making of the film. Both of them denied such rivalry. \nSengupta later claimed that she had been given lesser importance in the poster of the film while Roy said that the former's grievance is meaningless. Sengupta was absent at the premier show of the film, which generated the speculation in the media that the duo were no longer in talking terms. In April, 2014, the duo were spotted talking again at a quiz contest conducted by Anandabazar Patrika.\n\n"}

{"id": "1958265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958265", "title": "1980 Summer Olympics boycott", "text": "1980 Summer Olympics boycott\n\nThe 1980 Summer Olympics boycott was one part of a number of actions initiated by the United States to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The Soviet Union, which hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics, and its allies would later boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\nWestern governments first considered the idea of boycotting the Moscow 1980 summer Olympics in response to the situation in Afghanistan at the 20 December 1979 meeting of NATO representatives. The idea was not completely new to the world: since 1975/1976 proposals for an Olympic boycott circulated widely among human rights activists and groups as a sanction for Soviet violations of human rights. At that moment, not many of the member governments were interested in the proposal. The idea began to gain popularity in early January 1980 when Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov called for a boycott. On 14 January 1980, the Carter Administration joined Sakharov's appeal and set a deadline by which the Soviet Union must pull out of Afghanistan or face the consequences, including an international boycott of the games. On 26 January 1980, Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark announced that Canada, like the US, would boycott the Olympic Games if Soviet forces did not leave Afghanistan by 20 February 1980. Jimmy Carter also proposed moving the Olympics to Greece on a permanent basis to eliminate the issue of politicization of the Games' hosting, but the IOC rejected this idea.\n\nWhen the deadline passed a month later without any change to the situation in Central Asia, Carter pushed U.S. allies to pull their Olympic teams from the upcoming games.\n\nIn late January the Soviet regime prepared to face down this \"hostile campaign\". As Central Committee documents show, in addition to its own propaganda efforts it was relying on the International Olympic Committee and its 89 member committees to behave as in the past (e.g. after Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968), and not give in to pressure from national governments. It noted that the government and National Olympic Committee of France had already stated a willingness to participate.\n\nAfter its 24 April meeting, the head of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) Robert Kane told the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that the USOC would be willing to send a team to Moscow if there were a \"spectacular change in the international situation\" in the coming weeks.\n\nIn an attempt to save the Games Lord Killanin, then president of the IOC, arranged to meet and discuss the boycott with Jimmy Carter and Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, before the new 24 May deadline. Killanin insisted that the Games should continue as scheduled, while President Carter reaffirmed the US position. viz. to boycott the Games unless the USSR withdrew from Afghanistan.\n\nSeveral interventions at the late April 1980 Bilderberg meeting in Aachen included discussion of the implications of the boycott. The world would perceive a boycott, it was argued, as little more than a sentimental protest, not a strategic act. An African representative at the Bilderberg meeting voiced a different view: whether there was additional support outside the US or not, he believed, a boycott would be an effective symbolic protest and be dramatically visible to those within the Soviet Union. Some Russian dissidents expressed an opinion that boycott would be a strong message to the Soviets who breached the Olympic rules (using state-sponsored doping and professional athletes despite the fact that the rules of the time only allowed amateurs) to achieve their political goals. The Carter administration brought considerable pressure to bear on other NATO Member-States to support the boycott. Their support was not universal. \n\nThe International Olympics Federations protested that the pressures by the US and other supporting countries for the boycott was an inappropriate means to achieve a political end, and the victims of this action would be the athletes. West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said that the American attitude that the allies \"should simply do as they are told\" was unacceptable, although West Germany did join the boycott.\n\nBoxer Muhammad Ali traveled to Tanzania, Nigeria, and Senegal to convince their leaders to join the boycott. He also successfully convinced the Kenyan government to do so.\n\nMany countries ultimately joined the US in a full boycott of the Games. These included Japan and West Germany where Chancellor Schmidt was able to convince the National Olympic Committee (NOC) to support the boycott. China, the Philippines, Chile, Argentina and Canada also boycotted the Games entirely. Some of these countries competed at the alternative \"Liberty Bell Classic\" or Olympic Boycott Games held in Philadelphia that same year.\n\nThe governments of the United Kingdom, France, and Australia supported the boycott, but left any final decision over the participation of their country's athletes to their respective NOCs and the decision of their individual athletes. The United Kingdom and France sent a much smaller athletic delegation than would have originally been possible. The British associations that governed equestrian sports, hockey, and yachting completely boycotted the 1980 summer Olympics.\n\nSpain, Italy, Sweden, Iceland and Finland were other principal nations representing western Europe at the Games. Of these, Spain and Italy participated under a neutral flag with the Olympic anthem played in any ceremony. Italian athletes serving in its military corps could not attend the Games, however, because of the national government's official support of the boycott. Many events were affected by the loss of participants and some US-born athletes who were citizens of other countries, such as Italy and Australia, did compete in Moscow.\n\nA firm enemy of the United States under Ayatollah Khomeini's new theocracy, Iran also boycotted the Moscow Games after Khomeini joined the condemnation by the United Nations and the Islamic Conference of the invasion of Afghanistan. Independently of the United States, the Islamic Conference urged a boycott of Moscow after the invasion; the Ayatollah meanwhile accused Moscow of arming the Baluchis against his regime.\n\nLord Killanin permitted NOC-qualified athletes to compete at the Games without their national flags or anthems (which allowed NOCs to send athletes in a non-national context) but this did not allow other individuals lacking NOC sanction to participate in the Games as this was perceived by the IOC as a potential weakening of their authority. Four competitors (including one athlete) from New Zealand competed independently and marched under their NOC flag because the government officially supported the boycott. The athletes of 16 countries did not fly their national flags. Instead Olympic flags were raised and the Olympic Anthem replaced their national anthems at the medal ceremonies. There was one awards ceremony where three Olympic flags were raised, that being the men's individual pursuit in cycling.\n\nOther modifications were made in the Games activities, such as when the Boycott prevented Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau from attending the Moscow Games. Sandra Henderson and Stéphane Préfontaine, the final torchbearers at the previous games, were sent in his stead to participate in the Antwerp Ceremony at the opening ceremony, and at the closing ceremony, the Los Angeles city flag (rather than the United States flag) was raised to symbolize the next host of the Olympic Games. The Antwerp flag was received by an IOC member from the USA instead of the mayor of Los Angeles, Tom Bradley; there was no handover to Los Angeles ceremony at the closing.\n\nABC planned to spend at least $175 million for its Olympic coverage, given inflation and additional production costs after winning the bidding war on January 24, 1980, one day after NBC withdrew because of the \"unsettled world situation\" (a reference to a possible U.S. boycott of the Moscow games because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan). CBS was reportedly still in the bidding at the end of the negotiations. Earlier that week, NBC had asked the International Olympic Committee to postpone the negotiations for two months because of turmoil, but the IOC declined. When that happened, two NBC officials flew to Yugoslavia and requested a postponement from the Yugoslavian government for negotiations for the U.S. television rights to the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. When the Yugoslavs rejected the appeal, NBC withdrew, leaving the bidding to ABC and CBS. NBC reached an agreement with the Soviet government to pay the Soviets $87 million for the Moscow telecast, but said it will abide by whatever action the United States takes toward a boycott of the Soviet Games. As the U.S. government boycotted the event, the deal was cancelled.\n\nSixty-five countries that were invited to the 1980 Olympics, plus Qatar, did not participate for various reasons, including support for the boycott and economic reasons. (Qatar's 1980 IOC recognition came too late for it to be invited.) Taiwan refused to participate as a result of the 1979 Nagoya Resolution, in which the People's Republic of China agreed to participate in IOC activities if Taiwan was referred to as \"Chinese Taipei\". However, China boycotted the 1980 Moscow Games as well.\nThe sixteen nations that follow participated in the Games under some adjustment to full conventional participation in the Games activities.\n\nSeven countries participated in the Games without taking part in the Opening Ceremony:\n\nTwo nations sent one representative each (Chef de Mission) who entered the Olympic stadium during the Opening Ceremony under the Olympic flag; for each country this was a token gesture, as their governments allowed athletes to take part in the Games if they chose to do so. Ireland also competed under the Olympic flag, rather than its own.\n\nAt least 5 national teams participated at the Games under the Olympic flag rather than their respective National or NOC flags, as doing the latter would have denoted that their participation was officially sanctioned by their respective nations.\n\n\nEvents were staged separately in several sports, including the Liberty Bell Classic for track and field and the USGF International Invitational for gymnastics. U.S.–Cuban 12-bout card at the Charlotte Coliseum (on Independence Boulevard, now Bojangles' Coliseum) on February 10, 1980, became the only meeting of Cuban and American boxers and important event in boxing, \"one of the prime matches of the year,\" according to U.S. boxing Coach Tom Johnson.\n\n"}

Ingels (; June 7, 1915April 4, 1991) was a comic book and magazine illustrator best known for his work in EC Comics during the 1950s, notably on \"The Haunt of Fear\" and \"Tales from the Crypt\", horror titles written and edited by Al Feldstein, and \"The Vault of Horror\", written and edited by Feldstein and Johnny Craig. Ingels' flair for horror led EC to promote him as Ghastly Graham Ingels, and he began signing his work \"Ghastly\" in 1952.\n\nBorn in Cincinnati, Ingels began working at age 14 after the death of his father, commercial artist Don Ingels. Graham was 16 when he entered the art field drawing theater displays. He studied at New York's Hawthorne School of Art \nGraham and Gertrude Ingels married when he was starting as a freelancer at age 20. He entered the U.S. Navy in 1943, and he began working that same year for Fiction House Publications, both in their pulp magazines and their comic book division. Black and white illustrations signed G. Ingels appeared in \"Planet Stories\", \"Jungle Stories\", \"North-West Romances\" and \"Wings\". He contributed one painted cover to a 1944 issue of \"Planet Stories\" as well. For \"Planet Comics\", he illustrated stories in the \"Hunt Bowman\" series and the \"Aura, Lord of Jupiter\" series. He also painted a mural at the United Nations building.\n\nThe Ingels had two children, Deanna (born 1937) and Robby (born 1946), who was named after a character created by child impersonator Lenore Ledoux for the \"Baby Snooks\" radio program. Artist Howard Nostrand, a friend of Ingels, recalled:\n\nA regular in \"Planet Comics\" and \"Rangers Comics\" in the late 1940s, Ingels worked for Magazine Enterprises and other publishers of comic books and pulps. He became an art director at Better Publications (Ned Pine's Comics Group later known as Nedor), where he gave early comic book assignments to George Evans, with whom he would form a long friendship, and a young Frank Frazetta, who credited Ingels as the first in the business to recognize his talent. During this period, Ingels created covers and stories for the company's \"Startling Comics\" and \"Wonder Comics\"; these and other Better Publications comics reveal certain panels by other artists have been redrawn by Ingels to improve the artwork.\n\nIngels drew crime comics for Magazine Enterprises (\"Manhunt\", \"Killers\") and Westerns for a variety of companies, including Magazine Enterprises (\"Guns\"), Youthful Magazines (\"Gunsmoke\"), Hillman Periodicals (\"Western Fighters\") and D.S. Publishing Co. (\"Outlaws\"). D.S. also published crime stories drawn by Ingels in \"Underworld\", \"Gangsters Can't Win\" and \"Exposed\". There were also short stories and one painted cover by Ingels in Dell Comics' \"Heroic Comics\" around 1947.\n\nIn 1948, Ingels was hired by Al Feldstein, the editor of EC Comics, to provide artwork for their titles which included \"Gunfighter\", \"Saddle Justice\", \"Saddle Romances\", \"War Against Crime\", \"Modern Love\" and \"A Moon, A Girl... Romance\". The company's Western and romance comics were later canceled or converted to horror and science-fiction titles. In Grant Geissman's \"Foul Play\", Feldstein explained that Ingels' early work for EC was disappointing, but publisher Bill Gaines was fiercely loyal to everybody, which is why Ingels remained at the company. When EC introduced \"Tales From the Crypt\", \"The Vault of Horror\" and \"The Haunt of Fear\", it soon became apparent to both Gaines and Feldstein that Ingels was an ideal choice as an illustrator of horror.\n\nIngels' unique and expressive style was well-suited for the atmospheric depiction of Gothic horrors amid crumbling Victorian mansions in hellish landscapes populated by twisted characters, grotesque creatures and living corpses with rotting flesh. A trademark image was a character with a thread of saliva visible in a horrified open mouth.\n\nAs the lead artist for \"The Haunt of Fear\", he brought to life the Old Witch, horror host of \"The Witch's Cauldron\" lead story, and he also did the cover for each issue from issue 11 through 28. A prolific artist, Ingels also drew the Old Witch's appearances in Tales From the Crypt and The Vault of Horror, plus stories for \"Shock SuspenStories\" and \"Crime SuspenStories\". The Old Witch's origin story was told in \"A Little Stranger\" (\"The Haunt of Fear\" 14).\n\n\"Poetic Justice\" in the 12th issue, was adapted for the 1972 \"Tales From the Crypt\" film from Amicus studios in England, with Peter Cushing as the kindly old junk collector, and Ingels' \"Wish You Were Here\" (\"The Haunt of Fear\" 22) was also adapted.\n\nWhen EC cancelled its horror and crime comics, Ingels drew for EC's New Direction titles: \"Piracy\", \"M.D.\", \"Impact\" and \"Valor\". He later contributed to EC's short lived Picto-Fiction line.\n\nAfter EC ceased publication in the mid-1950s, Ingels contributed to \"Classics Illustrated\" but otherwise found little work, as discussed by Nostrand in \"Foul Play\": \"He was kind of a sad case, because when the horror stuff went out, Graham went out with it. His forte was strictly doing horror comics, and there weren't any more horror comics being done\".\n\nIngels took a teaching position with the Famous Artists correspondence school in Westport, Connecticut. He later left the Northeast and became an art instructor in Lantana, Florida, refusing to acknowledge his work in horror comics until a few years before he died. Journalist Donald Vaughan documented Ingels' life in Florida:\n\n\"Horror We? How's Bayou?\" in \"The Haunt of Fear\" issue #17 won an award as best EC horror art at the 1972 EC Fan-Addict Convention.\nIn 2004, the webcomic \"Is This Tomorrow?\" featured Ingels in its series of comic book trading cards.\n\nStarted in 2011, the Ghastly Awards adopted their name from Ingels's non-de-plume. The award, which honors excellence in horror comics, is presented annually. Ghastly Graham Ingels was the first Hall of Fame inductee.\n\n"}

It was founded in the mid-1980s as Communist Party of Finland (Unity) (, SKPy, FKP(e)) by the former opposition of the old Communist Party of Finland (1918–1992). SKP is not represented in the Finnish parliament, but the party has local councillors in some municipalities, including the city councils of Helsinki and Tampere. SKP claims 2,500 members.\n\nThe party has been officially registered since 1997. In the 1980s, when the opposition and the organizations it controlled were expelled from the SKP led by Arvo Aalto, the SKPy, however, chose not to register since they considered themselves the real SKP and claimed Aalto had illegally stolen the party. The courts later ruled all the expulsions illegal.\n\nThe internal conflict of Finnish communists began in the mid-1960s, when the party led by the new chairman Aarne Saarinen, began to modernize the party line / outlook. A minority of the party cadre didn't accept this and they accused the SKP leadership of being revisionist. SKP didn't break up in the 1960s and the party was formally united until the mid-1980s. After the 20th party congress in 1984 things, however, changed as Arvo Aalto was elected chairman, after which the opposition didn't participate in (or was left out of) the SKP central committee. The opposition, which was also known as “taistoists”, called supporters of Aalto “axe liners”.\n\nThe central committee of the SKP expelled eight opposition district organizations from the party 13 October 1985. Also, 494 other basic organizations and 17 city or regional organizations were expelled 13 June 1986, which the expelled then dubbed “Black Friday”. The opposition considered the actions to be against the law. They took the conflict to courts and because of minor technicalities Helsingin Hovioikeus court overruled SKP's decision 11 June 1987. SKP then re-expelled these same organizations in its 21st party congress (12–14 June 1987). However, a week before this happened, the newly founded SKP (Unity) held its own “21st” party congress. The ambiguities in the expelling process and the opposition's firm belief in its own cause gave it the justification it needed and they considered SKPy to be the real SKP. They claimed Aalto had illegally seized the party with “paper members”. SKPy was never taken to the official party register of Finland as the party considered that to have been voluntary resignation and admission of SKPy not being the real SKP.\n\nApril 26, 1986 a meeting of \"the representatives of SKP organizations\" was held in Tampere and those present elected a new central committee. The leader of the new central committee was Taisto Sinisalo, former vice chairman of the SKP and the most well-known figure of the opposition, who already had led \"Committee of SKP Organizations\" founded in November 1985. In the SKPy's 21st party congress Sinisalo was re-elected. Yrjö Hakanen and Marja-Liisa Löyttyjärvi became the vice chairmen while the former SKP chairman Jouko Kajanoja was elected party secretary. In his congress speech, Sinisalo told that the suffix “unity” meant “strong intention to gather all the forces of the SKP”. The congress, however, also was heading to future and building of a new party, or “rebuilding” as they thought it. Before the name SKPy was adopted the party was known in media as the \"unity\" or \"Tiedonantaja group\".\n\nSKPy was very committed to the Soviet Union and the political line of its Communist Party (CPSU), which was going through great changes during Gorbachev's time. SKPy supported perestroika but criticized those who claimed to have been \"Gorbachevist\" even before Gorbachev's time. SKPy claimed SKP to be anti-SU and tried to give the Finnish people as positive a picture as possible of that country. When SKP split the monetary support from Soviet Union was halted and, for example, the very profitable publishing deals of the SKP had gone to SKPy. Gorbachev's CPSU, however, had relations with both parties.\n\nIn the late 1970s the opposition of SKP began to split as those supporting a more traditional version of Marxism-Leninism began to criticize opposition leaders. When it was decided that SKPy would not be registered as an official party, some communists protested and demanded registration. They thought SKPy was clinging to the unity slogan in a situation in which it no longer seemed realistic. In the 1987 party congress, these people were warned by the SKPy leadership but they chose to ignore the advice and oriented themselves toward founding a new party. For Peace and Socialism - Communist Workers Party (\"Kommunistinen Työväenpuolue – Rauhan ja Sosialismin puolesta\", KTP) was founded early in the year 1988. Founders of KTP felt to be securing the existence of a Marxist-Leninist party in Finland while criticizing SKPy for being revisionist and supporting Mikhail Gorbachev. The most famous figure in the new party was probably Markus Kainulainen, a longtime SKP district secretary of Uusimaa and a former MP.\n\nEsko-Juhani Tennilä, a member of the Parliament of Finland, was elected new chairman of SKPy 22 October 1989 when Kajanoja decided to resign while strongly criticizing his comrades. Tennilä has later told he took the job to secure that the founding of a new united left party would not be sabotaged by his own party comrades many of which were quite critical of it. The Left Alliance (\"Vasemmistoliitto\") was founded in spring 1990 and members of SKPy and its electoral front Deva also joined even though prejudices were very high on both sides at this point.\n\nMembers of the Left Alliance (LA) disliked that many of their members were also members of the SKPy. It was thus decided that SKPy members couldn't participate in the LA's electoral lists, even though they could be members. Because of this, Tennilä also had to quit his job as party chairman when joining LA group in parliament. Yrjö Hakanen was chosen Tennilä's successor. The dispute over double membership, as it was called, led to many SKPy members leaving LA and relations between the two parties got even colder. On the other hand, many former SKPy members were actively participating in LA.\nIn its 1993 party congress (August 28–29) SKPy oriented towards founding a new officially registered communist party and drafting of a new party program. A new party logo was also introduced to mark renewal. It was suggested that a congress to continue SKP's work should be held and that happened next year (November 26–27). In the congress the suffix “unity” was dropped from the name as SKPy now considered to consist of all those comrades who wanted to have an independent communist party. An athletic club was made the basis of new organization and renamed SKP. The decision split the party as some supporters would have preferred SKP to have a lesser role as “Marxist forum” of some kind. Leadership of Left Alliance was also not pleased with those plans. SKP would have wanted to stay inside LA but that wasn't possible and the parties split in the spring of 1994. SKP wasn't however “re-registered” until 1997. There was some confusion, as the new SKP didn't accept responsibility for debts of the old one, which had gone bankrupt.\n\nSKP has a nationwide organization consisting of 14 district organizations. The central committee has 41 members and the politbyro 10. The organ of SKP is \"Tiedonantaja\", which was founded in the 1960s. Tiedonantaja was also the organ of Deva during 1986–1990. The editor-in-chief is Marko Korvela since 2012. SKP also has some local papers.\n\nAs the SKPy considered itself to be the real SKP it also had the same organizational structure. It was based on Leninist principle of democratic centralism and the party rules of 1958 (modified in 1978).\n\nWhile SKPy was never officially registered, its supporters founded an electoral front Democratic Alternative (', Deva). Those MPs of Finnish People's Democratic League (', SKDL, a front organization dominated by SKP) who were against expulsions were expelled from SKDL and they found the parliament group of Deva. Deva was SKPy's SKDL and it was supposed to attract some democratic allies. The small Socialist Workers Party (', STP) didn't join Deva but it had members on the DEVA list. Young supporters of SKPy and Deva founded Revolutionary Youth League (', VKN) which was Deva's youth organization. SKDL's Socialist Student League (\"\", SOL) also joined. Deva was led by actress Kristiina Halkola.\n\nIn 1987 parliamentary elections Deva got 4.3% of votes and four MPs. In 1988 presidential elections Deva candidate Jouko Kajanoja got under 2 per cent of the votes. Not even all members of SKPy supported Kajanoja who was the party chairman. Deva was closed down in 1990 after Left Alliance was founded and most of its members joined the new party.\n\nThe SKP participates in parliamentary, European Parliament and municipal elections. The party has not put up candidates in recent presidential elections. No national representatives has been elected from the SKP lists but the party has a few local councillors. The SKP also participates in trade union and cooperative elections.\n\nThe SKP first took part in parliamentary elections in 1999. The party had electoral alliances with small parties of \"Muutos 99\" coalition. It was the first time the Finnish electorate had an opportunity to vote for a list named Communist Party of Finland. In 2003 the vote-puller for the party was rock musician Kari Peitsamo (1 803 votes) and in 2007 rap artist Seppo \"Steen1\" Lampela (1 842).\n\nIn the local elections the SKP has had elected councillors in about ten different municipalities. The party has got its strongest support in Nokia, where there are three SKP councillors. Communists also briefly had three councillors in the Jyväskylä city council until early 2008.\n\nThe SKP has made electoral coalitions with other small parties, especially the Communist Workers Party (KTP). Communist League members were on SKP lists before they in 2006 founded the Workers Party of Finland (STP). The SKP condemned the STP for scattering communist forces. The parties have made some limited electoral cooperation since. The Left Alliance has never been interested in coalitions with the communists, although the parties have had coalitions in few municipalities.\n\nThe former SKP chairman Yrjö Hakanen is an elected member of HOK-Elanto cooperative council since 1999. The SKP represented joint list with the KTP.\n\n\n"}

Following the 2000 Croatian parliamentary election, he became part of the Cabinet of Ivica Račan I where he notably spearheaded the construction of motorways.\n\nHe was elected president of HNS again in 2008. Following the 2011 parliamentary election, as the leader of the second-largest party in the four-party Kukuriku coalition, Čačić became Deputy Prime Minister, as well as Minister of Economy, in the Government of Zoran Milanović.\n\nAfter causing a car crash that resulted in two fatalities, a Hungarian court sentenced him to 22 months in prison in November 2012. He resigned from his government post, and was ejected from HNS in 2013. After serving his prison sentence, Čačić returned to politics with a new political party, the People's Party - Reformists. In 2017. he was elected for zupan/prefect of Varazdin county.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Zagreb Faculty of Architecture in 1973, he worked for a Zagreb company before moving to Varaždin and joining the construction company \"Zagorje\". Together with several partners, in 1979 he left Zagorje and founded the construction company \"DP Coning\". In 1989, the Yugoslav Chamber of Commerce awarded him with the title of manager of the year. Čačić amassed considerable wealth in the process, and when the laws were changed in March 1989 to allow for privatization, he spent 750,000 German marks to buy a 25% stake in his old company \"Zagorje\", and later merged the two companies, with some jobs being lost in the process.\n\nHe first entered politics in the Coalition of People's Accord in 1989, but with no electoral success. In 1990 and 1991, with Čačić as the director, Coning was involved in a failed construction project in Dubrovnik.\n\nDuring the Croatian War of Independence, Čačić was a brigadier of the fledgling Croatian army. In the Battle of the Barracks, he led the September 1991 negotiations with the Yugoslav People's Army to abandon the Varaždin barracks and was used as a hostage to make sure disarmed army members were safely escorted to Serbia. He was later awarded the Homeland War Memorial Medal and the Order of Duke Domagoj.\n\nIn 1991-1992, Coning was involved in another much larger failed construction project in Israel, for which the company was later involved in multimillion-dollar lawsuits. DP Coning was transformed into Coning holding with several daughter companies, and the Holding was later renamed Ingprojekt. This transaction was later undone in a court of law, but Čačić had since sold or transferred his stakes in the Coning companies to a legal firm. Čačić's business affairs were commonly used against him when he became more active in politics, and for the Israel case he was once defamed by Miroslav Rožić. By 1995, he was one of the few Croatian politicians who were wealthy prior to entering a public office, although his wealth would later multiply during the course of his political activity.\n\nHe succeeded Savka Dabčević-Kučar as the president of the Croatian People's Party (HNS) and held the position for six years. He in turn was succeeded by Vesna Pusić, while Čačić became the president of the central committee of the party. He became a member of the Croatian Parliament after the 1995 parliamentary election.\n\nIn the 2000 election, the HNS won more seats in the Croatian Parliament and participated in the six-party coalition that formed the government under Ivica Račan. Čačić was the only member of HNS in the government but was given the influential and suitable position of the Minister of Public Works, Reconstruction and Building which granted him access to many government sponsored projects.\n\nRadimir Čačić was instrumental in reviving the project to build the Zagreb-Split motorway, arranging a more viable financing model – one that did not favour Bechtel Corporation so much as the contracts signed by Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) did, both before and after Čačić. The ministry invited tenders in order to choose the construction companies which would build the new road, and this method proved successful in getting the building under way. When Čačić exited the office, the sections from Karlovac to Zadar were mostly completed and the rest were also partially built.\n\nČačić also helped organize the public state-sponsored housing project for young families, the first such endeavour in modern-day Croatia. The buildings were later nicknamed \"Čačićevi stanovi\" (Čačić apartments) after him.\n\nAfter the 2003 election, the HNS returned to the opposition but Čačić retained a seat in the Parliament.\n\nThe new HDZ leadership organized a parliamentary investigation panel on Čačić's alleged misdeeds: he was accused of conflict of interest given how his old company Coning was also awarded contracts in building the Zagreb-Split highway. However, after the subsequent inquiry, Čačić was cleared of all charges. In December 2006, the HDZ parliamentary investigation panel again convened and changed its previous decision, saying Čačić was indeed in conflict of interest because of twelve contracts worth 132 million kuna signed with companies with a connection to Čačić, without this connection being properly registered according to relevant law. He in turn insisted that this was a meaningless distinction and that he was already disassociated from his old companies, and tried to get the decision reversed in court, but was rejected by a Zagreb court in 2007. He appealed the verdict and was ultimately rejected by the Constitutional Court of Croatia in 2010.\n\nIn 2005 his party won the local elections in the Varaždin County and Čačić became the župan (prefect) of the county on 9 June. He was replaced in June 2008, after two HNS deputies in the county council switched sides to the opposition.\n\nOn 8 January 2010, he caused a severe traffic accident on the M7 motorway in Hungary which resulted in injuries leading to deaths of two passengers in the car hit. Čačić's Chrysler 300 rear-ended a Škoda Fabia in dense fog. Čačić subsequently called the police. He was charged by a Somogy County court and released on €1,000 bail. Under Hungarian law he now faces a jail sentence. The incident led to Čačić handing in his resignation as president of the Croatian Tennis Association, which was later refused by the federation's governing board.\n\nČačić represented HNS in the Kukuriku coalition and was the top-listed candidate for the 3rd electoral district at the 2011 Croatian parliamentary election. In the district they won 52.73% of the vote. Following the overall election win, Čačić became a Deputy Prime Minister in the Cabinet of Zoran Milanović.\n\nOn 29 June 2012 the court of first instance found him guilty for the car accident and sentenced him to 1 year and three months on probation. Croatian opposition politicians Tomislav Karamarko, Jadranka Kosor and Dragutin Lesar called for Čačić to resign; members of the ruling coalition Mirela Holy and Josip Leko expressed reservations about the issue. On 14 November 2012 the court of second instance confirmed the verdict and increased his sentence to 22 months in prison. The same day, Čačić resigned from the Croatian Government.\n\nČačić was ejected from HNS in January 2014. He was released from prison in June 2014 after serving a year out of his 22-month sentence.\n\nOn 28 September 2014 he became the first president of the People's Party - Reformists.\n"}

{"id": "1958295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958295", "title": "Berlin–Baghdad railway", "text": "Berlin–Baghdad railway\n\nThe Baghdad railway, also known as the Berlin–Baghdad railway (, , , ), was built from 1903 to 1940 to connect Berlin with the then Ottoman city of Baghdad, from where the Germans wanted to establish a port on the Persian Gulf, with a line through modern-day Turkey, Syria, and Iraq.\n\nCompletion of the project took several decades and by the outbreak of World War I, the railway was still 960 km (600 miles) away from its intended objective. The last stretch to Baghdad was built in the late 1930s and the first train to travel from Istanbul to Baghdad departed in 1940.\n\nFunding, engineering and construction was mainly provided by the German Empire through Deutsche Bank and the Philipp Holzmann company, which in the 1890s had built the Anatolian Railway (\"Anatolische Eisenbahn\") connecting Constantinople, Ankara and Konya. The Ottoman Empire wished to maintain its control of the Arabian Peninsula and to expand its influence across the Red Sea into the nominally Ottoman (until 1914) Khedivate of Egypt, which had been under British military control since the Urabi Revolt in 1882. If the railway had been completed, the Germans would have gained access to suspected oil fields in Mesopotamia, as well as a connection to the port of Basra on the Persian Gulf. The latter would have provided access to the eastern parts of the German colonial empire, and avoided the Suez Canal, which was controlled by British and French interests.\n\nThe railway became a source of international disputes during the years immediately preceding World War I. Although it has been argued that they were resolved in 1914 before the war began, it has also been argued that the railway was a leading cause of World War I. Technical difficulties in the remote Taurus Mountains and diplomatic delays meant that by 1915 the railway was still short of completion, severely limiting its use during the war in which Baghdad was captured by the British while the Hejaz railway in the south was attacked by guerrilla forces led by T. E. Lawrence. Construction resumed in the 1930s and was completed in 1940.\n\nA history of this railway in the context of World War I describes the German interest in countering the British Empire, and Turkey's interest in countering their Russian rivals. As stated by a contemporary 'on the ground' at the time, Morris Jastrow wrote \"It was felt in England that if, as Napoleon is said to have remarked, Antwerp in the hands of a great continental power was a pistol leveled at the English coast, Baghdad and the Persian Gulf in the hands of Germany (or any other strong power) would be a 42-centimetre gun pointed at India.\"\n\nHad it had been completed earlier, the \"Berlin-Baghdad\" (and ultimately \"Basra\") railway would have enabled transport and trade from Germany through a port on the Persian Gulf, from which trade goods and supplies could be exchanged directly with the farthest of the German colonies, and the world. The journey home to Germany would have given German industry a direct supply of oil. This access to resources, with trade less affected by British control of shipping, would have been beneficial to German economic interests in industry and trade, and threatening to British economic dominance in colonial trade.\n\nThe railway also threatened Russia, since it was accepted as axiomatic that political influence followed economic, and the railway was expected to extend Germany's economic influence towards the Caucasian frontier and into north Persia where Russia had a dominant share of the market.\n\nBy the late 19th century the Ottoman Empire was weak, and cheap imports from industrialised Europe and the effects of the disastrous Russo-Turkish War (1877–78) had resulted in the country's finances being controlled by the Ottoman Public Debt Administration, composed of and answerable to the Great Powers. The Europeans saw great potential to exploit the resources of the weakening empire, irrigation could transform agriculture, there were chromium, antimony, lead and zinc mines and some coal. Not least there were potentially vast amounts of oil.\n\nAs early as 1871 a commission of experts studied the geology of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and reported plentiful oil of good quality, but commented that poor transportation made it doubtful these fields could compete with Russian and American ones. During 1901 a German report announced the region had a veritable \"lake of petroleum\" of almost inexhaustible supply.\n\nIn 1872 German railway engineer Wilhelm von Pressel was retained by the Ottoman government to develop plans for railways in Turkey. However, private enterprise would not build the railway without subsidies, so the Ottoman Government had to reserve part of its revenues to subsidise its construction, thus increasing its debt to the European powers.\n\nThe process of constructing a rail line from Constantinople to Baghdad began during 1888 when Alfred von Kaulla, manager of Württembergische Vereinsbank, and Georg von Siemens, Managing director of Deutsche Bank, created a syndicate and obtained a concession from Turkish leaders to extend the Haydarpaşa – İzmit railway to Ankara. Thus came into existence the Anatolian Railway Company (SCFOA, or ARC).\n\nAfter the line to Ankara was completed during December 1892, railway workshops were built in Eskişehir and permission was obtained to construct a railway line from Eskişehir to Konya; that line was completed in July 1896. These two lines were the first two sections of the \"Baghdad railway\". Another railway built at the same time by German engineers was the Hejaz railway, commissioned by Sultan Hamid II.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire chose to place the line outside the range of the guns of the British Navy. Therefore, the coastal way from Alexandretta to Aleppo was avoided. The line had to cross the Amanus Mountains inland at the cost of expensive engineering including an 8 km tunnel between Ayran station and Fevzipaşa.\n\nDuring 1898 and 1899 the Ottoman Ministry of Public Works received many applications for permission to construct a railway to Baghdad; it was not because of lack of competition that the Deutsche Bank was finally awarded the concession. A Russian plan was rejected for fear of it extending Russian influence in Constantinople. A well-financed British plan collapsed due to the outbreak of the Boer War. A well-financed French proposal titled the Imperial Ottoman railway enabled them to become financiers of the winning Deutsche Bank plan.\n\nOther nations of Europe paid little attention to the building of the railway lines until 1903, when the Ottoman Government gave an Ottoman corporation permission to build the railway line from Konia to Baghdad. This \"Baghdad Railway Company\" was controlled by a few German banks. (McMurray rejects the theory that the railway tied Turkey to Germany.)\n\nThere was concern in Russia, France, and Britain after 1903 as the implications of the German scheme to construct a great \"Berlin-Baghdad\" railway became apparent. A railway that would link Berlin to the Persian Gulf would provide Germany with a connection to its southernmost colonies in Africa, i.e. with German East Africa (present-day Rwanda and Burundi and the mainland part of Tanzania) and German South-West Africa (present-day Namibia, less Walvis Bay). The railway might eventually have strengthened the Ottoman Empire and its ties to Germany and might have shifted the balance of power in the region.\n\nDespite obstructions at the diplomatic level, work slowly began on the railway. Both geographical and political obstacles prevented the completion of the \"Baghdad railway\" before World War I commenced in 1914. Much of the construction work was undertaken by Philipp Holzmann.\n\nThe railway passed through the following towns and places, NW to SE:\n\nThe Mersin–Yenice–Adana line existed prior to the construction of the Bagdad railway and was used for the latter in its Yenice–Adana section.\n\nThe initial reaction of Britain was one of strong support. A long article outlining the positive benefits of the enterprise appeared in the \"Times\" newspaper. It was argued that Germany was a major trading partner of Britain, and that though the competition for trade would affect Britain the fact that it was a good trading partner that was winning the trade instead would make up for the loss.\n\nThe railway would obviously compete with British trade in Mesopotamia, but this would not happen for many years. However, in 1906 the Hamburg-American Steamship Line announced its intention to run regular steamships between Europe and the Persian Gulf. After a futile price war the British lines, which had lost their monopoly, came to agreement in 1913 with their competitors, ending a rivalry which had caused considerable political concern.\n\nIn 1911 the railway company looked to build a branch line to Alexandretta from Aleppo to pick up on the valuable trade of Northern Syria and the Northern Mesopotamian valley. However the Young Turk government could not offer further railway concessions without raising customs duties from 11 to 14 percent. Such a raise required the agreement of all the powers, but was vetoed by Britain after Sir Edward Grey spoke in the House of Commons: \" ... if the money is to be used to promote railways which may be a source of doubtful advantage to British trade ... I say it will be impossible for us to agree to that increase ... \".\n\nThe British realised that the railways would be slightly too close to their oilfields in Persia. The British were worried that the Young Turks could block off oil supplies vital for the navy.\n\nThe main British commercial interest that the British government insisted was protected, was that of the Right Honourable James Lyle Mackay, Baron Inchcape of Strathnaver. As well as being the foremost shipping magnate of the British Empire, Lord Inchcape was a director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and of the D'Arcy Exploration Company. On 23 February a contract was signed in London between Lord Inchcape and the Baghdad Railway Company. In March 1914 the German government was obliged to recognise southern Mesopotamia, as well as central and southern Persia, as the exclusive field of operations of the Anglo-Persian Company.\n\nDiscussion of the railway's role as a contributing factor to the outbreak of war are complicated by two issues:\n\nFirstly, historians and political analysts who wrote about this issue directly after the war were not in possession of closed diplomatic records. Full diplomatic documents of the German government were released between 1922 and 1927, British documents between 1926 and 1938. Only some Russian documents were released, and Italian documents only came out after the Second World War.\n\nSecondly, war historians tend to give an interpretation of the facts that is clouded by their own partisanship, political orientation, language, and contemporary perspectives. Socialist historians emphasised imperial rivalries and economic monopolies as the driving force for the war, as was popularly reported with respect to the railway at the time and especially as revealed in the Russian diplomatic documents. Regardless of diplomacy, financing and agreements, and later points of view, the existence of the railway would have created a threat to British dominance over German trade, as it would have given German industry access to oil, and a port in the Persian Gulf. The importance of oil as opposed to coal as fuel was recognised, as it could greatly improve the performance and capacity of the rival navies. The presence of the British there, and the creation of Kuwait to block non-British access to the Persian Gulf speaks to the strategic importance.\n\nOther historians have argued that intractable nationality issues in the denial of self-determination to minority groups were among the dominant causes of World War I. They argue that although the railway issue was heated before 1914 (Corrigan shows that the railway issue was driving Germany and Turkey further apart), conservative historians agree that it was not a cause of World War I, because the main controversies had been addressed in principle before the war started.\n\nHowever, war began on 1 August 1914 – and one day later the secret treaty establishing the Ottoman-German Alliance was signed, perhaps giving credence to the notion that the issue had not been fully resolved. In fact, restriction of German access to Mesopotamia and its oil, and strategic exclusion from rail access to the Persian Gulf was enforced by British military presence during World War I, and afterwards in the Treaty of Versailles by removal of the would-be Baghdad railway from German ownership. Thus the potential consequences to Anglo-German economic rivalry in oil and trade by the existence of the railway, were ultimately addressed by ownership and outright control, rather than by agreement. Marxist historians, unpopular in the Anglo-American perspective on process would suggest that economic contexts, rather than nationalistic and political rivalries underlie the root causes.\n\nBy 1915, the railway ended some east of Diyarbakır. Another spur, heading east from Aleppo, ended at Nusaybin. Additionally some rail was laid starting in Baghdad reaching north to Tikrit and south to Kut. This left a gap of some 480 kilometres (300 miles) between the railway lines. Additionally, there were three mountains which the railway was going to go through, but the tunnels through these three mountains were not complete. So the railway was, in fact, broken into four different sections at the start of the war. The total time to get from Constantinople to Baghdad during the war was 22 days. The total distance was \n\nThe breaks in the railway meant that the Ottoman government had significant difficulties in sending supplies and reinforcements to the Mesopotamian Front. The fighting in Mesopotamia remained somewhat isolated from the rest of the war.\nDuring the conflict, Turkish and German workers, together with allied prisoners of war, laboured to complete the railway for military purposes but with limited manpower and so many more important things to spend money on, only two of the gaps were closed.\n\nIn 1919, the Treaty of Versailles cancelled all German rights to the \"Baghdad railway\", however, the \"Deutsche Bank\" transferred its holdings to a Swiss bank.\n\nThe Treaty of Ankara in 1921 established the Syria–Turkey border as running along the railway track from Çobanbey in the west to Nusaybin in the east, with the border being on the Syrian side of the track, leaving the track in Turkish territory. Further west, the Treaty also set the border immediately north of the town and railway station of Meidan Ekbis.\n\nPeople in Turkey, Italy, France, and Britain created various arrangements that gave a certain degree of control over the \"Baghdad railway\" to various indistinct interests in those nations. Investors, speculators, and financiers were involved by 1923 in secretive and clandestine ways.\n\nThe British Army had completed the southeastern section from Baghdad to Basra, so that part was under British control. The French held negotiations to obtain some degree of control over the central portion of the railway, and Turkish interests controlled the oldest sections that had been constructed inside of Turkey, but talks continued to be held after 1923. The United States involvement in the Near East began in 1923 when Turkey approved the Chester concession, which aroused disapprovals from France and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1930, a passenger service by road was introduced to bridge the missing section of line between Nusaybin and Kirkuk. At different times the service used Rolls-Royce cars and Thornycroft buses.\n\nIn 1932, the Kingdom of Iraq became independent from the UK. In 1936, Iraq bought all railways in its territory from the UK and started building the missing section of line from Tel Kotchek to Baiji. On 15 July 1940 the railway had been completed, and two days later the Taurus Express made its first complete journey between Istanbul and Baghdad. In that year, the Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns locomotive works in Britain built a class of streamlined Pacific steam locomotives to haul the Taurus Express between Baghdad and Tel Kotchek. These were delivered to Iraqi State Railways in 1941 and entered service as the PC class.\n\nA new standard gauge railway opened between Baghdad and Basra for freight traffic in 1964 and for freight in 1968. It was also used for passenger traffic at least into the 1970s. This replaced a metre gauge line built in 1920 and for the first time connected the Bosphorus with the Persian Gulf without a break of gauge. Due to the strained relations between Turkey, Syria and Iraq however, continuous traffic remained rare, and other means of transport soon reduced its strategic and economic relevance.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The suburb is in the City of Norwood Payneham & St Peters, the oldest South Australian local government municipality, with a city population over 34,000.\n\nNorwood is named after Norwood, London. It was first laid out in 1847. In 1970, residents organised protests and a green ban in order to stop the destruction of the Norwood Velodrome for high-rise flats.\n\nThe suburb consists of four segments, being divided into north and south by the major thoroughfare of The Parade and east and west by Osmond Terrace. It is bounded on the south by Kensington Road, on the north by Magill Road, on the east by Portrush Road and on the west by Fullarton Road. It is a leafy suburb many of whose streets are lined with plane trees and older houses, though in recent years, due to a State Government initiative of \"urban-infill\", there have been more higher density (by Adelaide standards) developments. It is now a sought-after suburb to live in, but this was not always the case.\n\nOsmond Terrace is a street with a wide median strip featuring a prominent war memorial commemorating ANZAC soldiers who fought in the first and second World Wars.\n\nThe most visible landmarks in Norwood are the Norwood Town Hall and the Clayton-Wesley Uniting Church (previously Clayton Congregational Church) on the north east corner of Portrush Road and The Parade. Actually located in Beulah Park, the church, built over 150 years ago, is visible all the way up The Parade.\n\nNorwood attracted many European migrants post-World War II. It still has a very high concentration of people of Italian background. This is reflected in the restaurants and fashion boutiques of The Parade. Norwood's heritage and bohemian character can be ascertained from the political voting patterns; it tends to be more left-wing in nature than the other eastern suburbs around it.\n\nSeveral Adelaide Metro bus routes serve the suburb. Many route numbers and timetables were changed on 16 January 2011.\n\nThese routes now run through or adjacent to Norwood 300 (Suburban Connector, expanded version of former Circle line): cross city route traversing Portrush Road.\nB10, H30, H31: Magill Road\nH20, H21, H22, H23, H24, N22: The Parade\n141,142: Kensington Road\n\nNorwood Oval on The Parade is home to the Norwood Redlegs, a South Australian National Football League (Australian Rules Football) team. Also the home of Adelaide Bite.\n\nThe queen of Adelaide’s eastern suburbs: hip, sassy and smitten with cafe life. The parade contains the business centre of the suburb, which includes some professional services but it is better known for its restaurants, cafes, fashion boutiques and hairdressers.\n\nSaint Bartholomew's (St Bart's) in Norwood and St Matthew's in nearby Kensington are two churches with a close association with each other, with three church ministers involved in both congregations. They are both evangelical and conservative Anglican churches, with a large number of young adult members.\n\nSaint Ignatius Catholic Parish Church, built in the 1860s by the Society of Jesus (more commonly referred to as Jesuits) and finished by 1872, is also a significant feature in the suburb. The accompanying presbytery housed Mary MacKillop, founder of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, where she took refuge after her (temporary) excommunication by Bishop Sheil.\n\nMany famous South Australians have resided in Norwood, including:\n\n"}

She is best known for her first novel, \"Goodnight Mister Tom\", which won the 1982 Guardian Prize for British children's books and has been adapted several times for screen or stage. Two other well-known works are \"Back Home\" and \"A Little Love Song\". She resides in Petersfield, Hampshire.\n\nMichelle Magorian was born in Portsmouth, Hampshire, and is of Armenian origin. She lived in Singapore and Australia from age seven to nine. As a child she spent as much time as possible in the King's Theatre in Portsmouth and her ambition was to become an actress. After three years of study at the Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama, she spent two years at Marcel Marceau's L'école Internationale de Mime in Paris. From there she launched into a professional acting career and spent a few years touring all over the country - from Scotland to Devon and then Yorkshire - working in repertory companies, taking any part she could. Michelle's worst stage part was playing Orinoco in \"The Wombles\" musical. All this time she had been secretly writing stories. When she was 24 she became interested in children's books, and decided to write one herself.\n\nThe result was \"Goodnight Mister Tom\", which was based from the colours in a song from \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\". She thought of brown as an earthy, old colour and green as a colour of youth. The character of William Beech came into her head because she thought of a beech tree with its slim trunk and it gave her the idea for a slim young boy. Some details for the story came from her mother's tales about her time as a nurse in World War II. She needed four-and-a-half years to complete it because she was also working in the theatre. After she had finished the book, she joined a novel-writing class, at which she shared the book. It was published by Kestrel Books in 1981 and quickly became an international success. At home Magorian won the annual Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, a once-in-a-lifetime award judged by a panel of British children's writers and she was a commended runner up for the Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. She also won the International Reading Association Children's Book Award. The book was adapted as a film of the same name by ITV and aired in 1998; it has also been adapted as a musical.\n\nMagorian followed \"Good Night Mister Tom\" with \"Back Home\" (1984), another story about a child evacuated during World War II. Where \"Mister Tom\" featured a young London boy living in the English countryside during the war, \"Back Home\" featured a girl struggling back home in Britain after five years with a family in United States.\n\n\"A Little Love Song\" (\"Not a Swan\" in the US), her third novel, features a young woman becoming independent and finding first love in wartime Britain. Most of Magorian's other books are also set in the mid-20th century, often based around theatres. She has written three more novels —\"Cuckoo in the Nest\" (1994), \"A Spoonful of Jam\" (1998), and \"Just Henry\" (2008)— and two collections of poetry, a collection of short stories, and two picture books.\n\nIn 2007, she received an honorary doctorate from Portsmouth University.\n\n\"Just Henry\" won the 2008 Costa Book Award in the Children's Book category.\n\n\nGoodnight Mister Tom\n\n"}
{"id": "1958303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958303", "title": "Glee (music)", "text": "Glee (music)\n\nA glee is an English type of part song spanning the late baroque, classical and early romantic periods. It is usually scored for at least three voices, and generally intended to be sung unaccompanied. Glees often consist of a number of short, musically contrasted movements and their texts can be convivial, fraternal, idyllic, tender, philosophical or even (occasionally) dramatic. Their respectable and artistic character contrasts with the bawdiness of many catches of the late 17th century, which were thought inappropriate in female company. Although most glees were originally written to be sung in gentlemen's singing clubs, they often included soprano parts—which were sung by boys (church choristers) in earlier years, and later by ladies who were often present, although only as guests. Glees as described above fall into a different musical category from traditional college songs or fight songs.\n\nThe standard glee is a three- or four-voice a cappella song, although many examples also exist with from five to eight voices, and some early glees have basso continuo accompaniment. It is generally to be sung by solo voices. Glees often consist of several short movements. The use of the countertenor voice, often on the upper part, is a particular characteristic of the form (the most famous exponent was William Knyvett), serving to distinguish it from German male voice music, in which the top part is taken by a tenor.\n\nThe first song to be described as a glee was \"Turn, Amaryllis, to thy Swain\" by Thomas Brewer. Glees were occasionally produced during the remainder of the 17th century and increasingly so in the first half of the 18th century by such composers as John Travers and William Hayes. The heyday of the glee was in the years between 1750 and 1850. Perhaps inspired by a revival of the English madrigal (and other early music) by the Academy of Vocal (later Ancient) Music (founded 1726), English composers, unlike their continental contemporaries, began again to compose a cappella music. At first the predominant stylistic influence was Italianate, but later glee composers juxtaposed sections in the French Overture style and style galant with affetuoso 3/4 movements and sections of robust Handelian fugal writing. Glees were also often introduced into stage productions. As the 19th century progressed, and musical tastes changed, the glee as a musical form began to be replaced by the romantic Part song. By the mid-20th century, the glee had become a musical curiosity, seldom performed. However, professional singing groups have, since then, performed and recorded glees with some success.\n\nThe first of the great Georgian clubs to popularize the glee was the Noblemen and Gentlemen's Catch Club of London, founded in 1761. Glee singing societies became popular in the 18th century and remained so, well into the 19th century. Glee clubs were at their most active during the second half of the 18th century, encouraging the production of new glees by awarding prizes to their composers. For example, in 1763 the Catch Club was offering four prizes annually - two for glees (one serious, one cheerful), one for a catch and one for a canon. From around 1850, as larger choral societies supplanted the earlier clubs, the term \"glee club\" was increasingly used in the U.S.A. to describe collegiate ensembles performing 'glees' and other light music in informal circumstances. As these glee clubs began more to resemble standard choirs during the 20th century, the tradition of singing glees in a social context faded.\n\nA notable, if not entirely typical, example of a glee is \"Glorious Apollo\", a composition by Samuel Webbe Sr., written in 1787 as a theme song for the newly founded London Glee Club. Webbe's glee took root with the Harvard Glee Club, the oldest such group in America, which still sings this song. Webbe wrote the text as well as the music, and in it he faithfully traced the London Glee Club's history; for the first couple of years, the meetings circulated among members' homes. This is reflected in the second line, which notes that the club was \"wand'ring to find a temple for his praise.\" It finally found its \"temple\" when the club's meetings moved to the Newcastle Coffee House. Webbe's references to the gods of the Greek pantheon were part and parcel of the Georgian gentlemen's singing clubs' identification with the learning and leisure activities of the classical world. Webbe structured the poem so that the first two couplets of each verse were sung by solo voices, with all the members joining in at the refrain, \"Thus then combining...\".\n\nAnother of Webbe's glees is \"Discord!\", whose first movement is based on a passage from \"Iliad\" (Book 4) and whose second is based on a verse which, it is thought, he composed himself.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the 1940 Australian federal election she stood as a federal Senate candidate for the Australian Labor Party in Western Australia, and again in the 1943 Australian federal election, when she was the first woman elected to the Senate. She served in the Senate from 21 August 1943 to 30 June 1968. Her 25 years of service made her the longest-serving woman parliamentarian. Her record has since been surpassed by Kathy Sullivan. She was the last surviving member of the 1944-1947 Senate.\n\nSenator Tangney was committed to an agenda of social reform, which included extending federal powers over social services and instituting Commonwealth assistance in education. Senate committees on which Senator Tangney served included the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and the Select Committee on the Development of Canberra, supporting the development of the Australian National University, and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Social Security.\n\nTangney was born on 13 March 1907 in North Perth, Western Australia. As an adult she claimed to have been born in 1911. She was the third of nine children born to Ellen (née Shanahan) and Eugene Tangney; her father was born in Ireland and her mother was of Irish descent. Her paternal grandfather Owen Shanahan assisted in Irish republican John Boyle O'Reilly's escape from Western Australia.\n\nTangney spent her early years in country Western Australia where her father was a locomotive driver and timber worker. The family lived in the Murchison for a period and later in Holyoake and Marrinup. When she was eight, her father found work in the port city of Fremantle where she attended St Joseph's Convent School. She won a scholarship to attend St Joseph's College, selling raffle tickets to raise money for her school uniform. Tangney passed her leaving certificate at the age of 15 and began training as a schoolteacher, combining her teaching work with part-time study at the University of Western Australia. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1927 and later completed a postgraduate diploma in education in 1932.\n\nAfter several years in Fremantle, Tangney began teaching at Claremont Central School in 1929. She was involved in the Teachers' Union and a vice-president of the state Parents' and Citizen's Association. She attended the organisation's federal conference in Sydney in 1933 and was a delegate to the Pan-Pacific Conference in Wellington, New Zealand, in 1939.\n\nTangney and her mother were active members of the Claremont branch of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). She was eventually elected to the Western Australian Labor Women's Organisation Committee, and then to the party's state executive. She helped establish the University Labor Club, later serving as its president, and was also the founding president of the Fremantle Young People's Ideal Club in 1929, which organised activities for the children of the unemployed and was absorbed into the Western Australian Young Labor League.\n\nTangney stood for the seat of Nedlands at the 1936 and 1939 Western Australian state elections, losing to her Nationalist opponent Norbert Keenan on both occasions. She won preselection for the ALP Senate ticket at the 1940 federal election, but was not elected.\n\nTangney was elected to the Senate at the 1943 federal election to fill a casual vacancy caused by the death of Bertie Johnston. She was the first woman elected to the Senate, with her term beginning immediately upon her election; Enid Lyons simultaneously became the first woman elected to the House of Representatives. Tangney was sworn in six minutes before Lyons.\n\nIn 1968 Tangney was the first woman born in Western Australia to be appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

He managed Arsenal, Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic, Birmingham, Chelsea and Shrewsbury Town.\n\nKnighton was born in Church Gresley, Swadlincote, Derbyshire. His own playing career was cut short by injury, after which he moved into coaching and management. He first had spells as an assistant manager at Manchester City (1909–12) and Huddersfield Town (1912–19) – and was briefly caretaker manager of the latter in 1912. In 1919 Knighton was appointed secretary-manager of Arsenal, shortly after the club had been promoted to the First Division.\n\nHe oversaw the club for six years, but Arsenal never finished higher than mid-table, their best finish during his tenure being ninth in 1920-21. Neither did Arsenal do well in the FA Cup under Knighton - in only one season, 1921-22, did Arsenal get beyond the second round of the competition, eventually losing to Preston North End in a quarter-final replay.\n\nDuring his time at Arsenal, Knighton had numerous fallings-out with Arsenal chairman Sir Henry Norris; Norris put a strict cap of £1,000 on transfer fees and refused to sign any player under 5'8\" tall or eleven stone. When Knighton signed the 5' tall Hugh \"Midget\" Moffatt from Workington in 1923, Norris was furious when he found out; he overruled his manager and promptly sold the player to Luton Town before he'd played a League game. To get round Norris's rules, Knighton used his guile to sign some unusual transfers, such as the amateurs Reg Boreham and Jimmy Paterson - the latter was the Arsenal club doctor's brother-in-law, and went on to play nearly 80 games for Arsenal.\n\nDespite Norris's interfering, Knighton, thanks to an informal scouting system of his friends and former colleagues in the North, signed several high-quality players for Arsenal; these included Bob John, Jimmy Brain and Alf Baker, all of whom would be part of Arsenal's trophy-winning side of the early 1930s. However, he could never knit together a solid winning side and Arsenal's performances gradually declined towards the end of his tenure; they finished 19th in 1923-24 and 20th in 1924-25.\n\nDuring his final season at Arsenal, Knighton was involved in one of the first recorded cases of doping; before a January 1925 FA Cup first round tie against West Ham United, Knighton gave the players what he described as \"little silver pills\", given to him by a Harley Street doctor who was a fan of the club; although the pills were successful in increasing the players' energy, the side-effects caused them to have raging thirst. Arsenal drew the match 0-0 and before the replay they rebelled and refused to take them; Arsenal eventually lost 1-0 in the second replay after the first finished 2-2. Knighton's activities, entirely legal under the rules at the time, were not made public until he recounted the episode in his memoirs.\n\nNorris dismissed Knighton in the summer of 1925 and replaced him with Herbert Chapman. Knighton later alleged that Norris has only sacked him to avoid paying him a bonus (estimated at up to £4,000) from a benefit match that he was due. Norris denied this and instead cited Arsenal's poor record that season (having finished 20th and knocked out of the FA Cup first round), but later regretted his dismissal, stating it was the one mistake in his career and in his will left Knighton £100.\n\nAfter leaving the Gunners, Knighton went on to manage Bournemouth (1925–28), Birmingham (1928–33), whom he led to the 1931 FA Cup Final, Chelsea (1933–39) taking over from the long serving David Calderhead, and Shrewsbury Town (1945–48), before their election to the Football League. Knighton retired to Bournemouth after suffering ill health and took on the less pressurised job of a golf club secretary, during which he found time to write an autobiography, \"Behind the Scenes in Big Football\" (1948). He died in 1959, aged 72.\n"}

He was a member of several groups during the 1960s before recording as a solo artist and having hit singles with \"Elizabethan Reggae\" (in 1970), \"I Wanna Wake Up with You\" and \"You're Everything to Me\" (both 1986).\n\nBorn in the Rollington Town area of Kingston, Jamaica, Gardiner attended Franklin Town Government School and St Monica's College, dropping out of education after being diagnosed with tachycardia.\n\nIn 1960 he joined Richard Ace's band the Rhythm Aces, which also included Delano Stewart, later of the Gaylads. With the group he recorded \"Angella\", and the local hits \"A Thousand Teardrops\" and \"C–H–R–I–S–T–M–A–S\" (written with his brother Barrington). The group split up and by 1963 Gardiner had joined Kes Chin and The Souvenirs as vocalist, and began learning guitar. He went on to join Carlos Malcolm & the Afro Caribs with whom he started playing bass guitar after the original bassist left, and when that band ended he started his own group, the Broncos, named after the Bronco Club where they had a residency. He later played with Byron Lee's Dragonaires. In the late 1960s and 1970s he worked extensively as a session musician as a member of the Now Generation, The Upsetters, The Aggrovators, and The Crystallites. While working at Studio One he played on hits such as The Heptones' \"On Top\", Larry and Alvin's \"Nanny Goat\", and Marcia Griffiths' \"Feel Like Jumping\".\n\nAs a solo artist, Gardiner had a hit with the song \"Elizabethan Reggae\" in 1970, a version of Ronald Binge's \"Elizabethan Serenade\". When the single was released in the United Kingdom, the first copies were printed with the label incorrectly identifying Byron Lee (not Gardiner) as the performer. Lee was the producer of the track. The UK Singles Chart printed this error for the first chart entry and the first four weeks of its re-entry into the charts. After 28 February 1970, all printings gave Gardiner credit.\n\nHis debut album, \"Reggae Happening\", was also released in 1970 and (although it did not chart). Music journalist Ian McCann said that the album \"sold respectably for a reggae LP\" in the UK. Gardiner's music continued to be popular in Jamaica, but interest waned in the UK. During the 1970s he continued session work, including several recordings for Lee \"Scratch\" Perry including Junior Murvin's \"Police and Thieves\".\n\nThe Boris Gardiner Happening recorded a version of \"Ain't No Sunshine\" in 1973 with Paul Douglas singing lead, and Boris Gardiner playing bass guitar, for the album \"Is What's Happening\".\n\nIn 1986, Gardiner recorded the single \"I Wanna Wake Up with You\", which became a surprise number one hit in the UK. It spent two months in the top ten. The accompanying album, \"Everything to Me\" also included the follow-up hit, \"You're Everything to Me\", which peaked at number 11. The single \"The Meaning of Christmas\" (a re-recording of \"C–H–R–I–S–T–M–A–S\") was also released later that year, and was a minor hit. Later, Gardiner signed to RCA Records.

Ἔρις, \"Strife\") tossed in the midst of the feast of the gods at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis as a prize of beauty, thus sparking a vanity-fueled dispute among Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite that eventually led to the Trojan War (for the complete story, see \"The Judgement of Paris\"). Thus, \"apple of discord\" is used to signify the core, kernel, or crux of an argument, or a small matter that could lead to a bigger dispute.\n\nBecause of this, the Roman goddess corresponding to the Greek Eris was named \"Discordia\". Also, in German and in Dutch, the words are used a lot more often colloquially than in English, though in German the colloquial form is not \"Apfel der Zwietracht\" (lit. \"Apple of Discord\") but \"Zankapfel\" (\"Quarrel-apple\") and rarely \"Erisapfel\"; the Dutch is \"twistappel\" (\"Strife-apple\").\n\nIn the Eixample district of Barcelona, there is a block nicknamed in Spanish \"La manzana de la discordia\" (). The reason for this usage is that \"manzana\" means both \"apple\" and \"city block\" in Spanish.\nIt was so named (\"block of discord\") because it features four different interpretations of \"Modernisme\" architecture: Antoni Gaudí's Casa Batlló, Lluís Domènech i Montaner's Casa Lleó Morera, Josep Puig i Cadafalch's Casa Amatller, and Enric Sagnier's Casa Mulleras.\n\nIn some later sources, Eris inscribed on the apple \"for the fair\" or \"to the most beautiful\" before tossing it. The most popular version of the inscription is ΤΗ ΚΑΛΛΙΣΤΗΙ (, Modern Greek: τη καλλίστη \"ti kallisti\"; \"for/to the most beautiful\"). \"Καλλίστῃ\" is the dative singular of the feminine superlative of καλός, beautiful. In Latin sources, the word is \"formosissima\".\n\n"}

He went to school at Alfred House Academy in London and apprenticed with Benjamin Lepard, a wholesale stationer, at Covent Garden. In collaboration with his brother-in-law Edward Cowper (1790–1852), he carried out most of his work in the Dartford and Crayford areas of Kent.\n\nApplegath was a skilled printer who notably made a number of improvements to the steam-powered flat-bed press of Friedrich Konig (1813). Other inventions included processes for printing on silk and, in 1816, improvements to banknote printing. By 1819, Applegath's banknote machine was installed at the Bank of England.\n\nIn 1828, Applegath and Cowper built a flatbed printing machine for The Times in London. This press had the capacity of 4,200 prints per hour.\n\nWilliam Nicholson had patented a rotary printing press in 1790, but attempts to build a working prototype had been unsuccessful. It was not until 1848 that Applegath developed a working version. In that same year, it replaced the flatbed printer that had been in use at The Times for almost twenty years.\n\nThe design consisted of a large vertical cylinder, 200 inches in circumference. Ordinary type was used in columns to produce a polygonal printing surface. It had eight impression cylinders and needed eight people to feed the paper. It could produce 8,000 impressions per hour (on one side of the paper) and eventually up to 10,000 depending on the skill of those feeding it. \nA four-cylinder version of Applegath's press as used by the Illustrated London News was featured at The Great Exhibition of 1851 in London.\n\nAt the same time, Richard Hoe of New York was developing a more efficient horizontal rotary press which as available with two, four, six or ten impression cylinders. The first one of this type was imported by Edward Lloyd in 1856 and was soon adopted by many newspapers including The Times.\n\n"}

Administratively, Nikopol is incorporated as the city of oblast significance and serves as the administrative center of Nikopol Raion which it does not belong to. Population: 116,834 (2015 est.).\n\nIn terms of population, Nikopol is the third biggest city in the oblast as well as among the top 50 nationwide. The city is also a powerful industrial and transportation center in the country conveniently located by the Kakhovka reservoir. In 1638–1652 the settlement of Mykytyn Rih served as a capital of Zaporizhian Sich (Zaporizhian Host the Lower).\n\nThe 1911 edition of Encyclopædia Britannica gave the following description of Nikopol:\nIt was formerly called \"Mykytyn Rog\", and occupies an elongated peninsula between two arms of the Dnieper at a point where its banks are low and marshy, and has been for centuries one of the places where the middle Dnieper can most conveniently be crossed. Note, during the period of Russian Empire in Ukraine, the Ukrainian language was recognized as fictitious and was strictly prohibited, hence the names were transliterated from the Russian language.\n\nIn 1900, its 21,282 inhabitants were Ukrainians, Jews and Mennonites, who carry on agriculture and shipbuilding. The old Sich, or fortified camp of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, brilliantly described in N. V. Gogol's novel Taras Bulba (1834), was situated a little higher up the river. A number of graves in the vicinity recall the battles which were fought for the possession of this important strategic point. One of graves, close to the town, contained, along with other Scythian antiquities, a well-known precious vase representing the capture of wild horses. Even now Nikopol, which is situated on the highway from Dnipro to Kherson, is the point where the \"salt-highway\" of the Chumaks (Ukrainian salt-carriers) to the Crimea crosses the Dnieper. Nikopol is, further, one of the chief places on the lower Dnieper for the export of corn, linseed, hemp and wool.\n\nAccording to archaeological excavations, the city's area was populated as early as the Neolithic epoch in the 4th millennium BCE as evidenced by remnants of a settlement discovered on banks of Mala Kamianka River. In burial mounds of copper-bronze epoch in the 3rd-1st millenniums BCE were found stone and bronze tools, clay sharp-bottomed ornamental dishes. Here also were researched burials of Scythian-Sarmatian period in the 2nd century BCE – the 2nd century CE.\n\nIn the beginning of 16th century in place of Nikopol appeared a river crossing over Dnieper controlled by Cossacks, Mykytyn Rih. According to a folk legend, it was established by a Cossack Mykyta Tsyhan. Under the same name the crossing is mentioned in diary of the Holy Roman Empire envoy Erich Lassota von Steblau who visited Zaporizhian Sich in 1594.\n\nIn 1638-1639 Cossacks led by F.Linchai built here a fort which is conditionally named as Mykytyn Sich (). Soon due to conflict with Hetman of Zaporizhian Host, in 1652 Kosh Otaman Fedir Lyutai moved the administrative seat to Chortomlyk.\n\nBy 1648, in the close proximity of today's Nikopol, Mykytyn Sich was built, renowned for the fact that it was here that Bohdan Khmelnytsky was elected as the Hetman of Ukraine, and it was here that the rebellion against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth started. Until 1775, the time of the Sich sacking, it was called \"Mykytyn Rih\", \"Mykytyn Pereviz\", or simply \"Mykytyne\". The name \"rih\" (Ukrainian for horn) was given because the locality rose at a place reminiscing a peninsula, as it was almost surrounded by the Dnieper river (see Kryvyi Rih). Mykytyne was a town of the Kodak Palanka, an administrative division of the Zaporizhian Sich. Later it was renamed into Slovianske and then Nikopol.\n\nWhat could be now the most sacred place of an early distinctly Ukrainian statehood was eventually submerged by water, owing to the Soviet policy of industrialization. The Kakhovka Reservoir covers now the lands of the former Zaporizhian Host and the burial sites of thousands of former heroes whose names, probably, will never be recovered.\n\nDuring World War II, Nikopol was occupied by the German Army until 18 February 1944. Albert Speer refers to it as the \"center of manganese mining,\" and of vital importance to Hitler for armaments production.\n\nJust a few kilometres west of the city, the Kosh otaman Ivan Sirko is buried.\n\nNowadays Nikopol is one of the largest towns in the region with the population of 120 774 (2013). The largest manufactures are former Nikopol Tube Plant, which is not divided into smaller plants, and Nikopol Ferroalloy Plant, which is the largest in Europe and second in the world in producing Ferromanganese (FeMn) and Ferrosilicomanganese (FeSiMn). There is bus station, railway station and river port, which connect the town with other cities.\n\nNikopol is twinned with:\n\n"}

Fujian cuisine is known to be light but flavourful, soft, and tender, with particular emphasis on umami taste, known in Chinese cooking as \"xianwei\" (), as well as retaining the original flavour of the main ingredients instead of masking them.\n\nMany diverse seafood and woodland delicacies are used, including a myriad variety of local fish, shellfish and turtles, or indigenous edible mushrooms and bamboo shoots, provided by the coastal and mountainous regions of Fujian. The most commonly employed cooking techniques in the region's cuisine include braising, stewing, steaming and boiling.\n\nParticular attention is paid on the finesse of knife skills and cooking technique of the chefs, which is used to enhance the flavour, aroma and texture of seafood and other foods. Strong emphasis is put on the making and utilising of broth and soups. There are sayings in the region's cuisine: \"One broth can be changed into numerous (ten) forms\" () and \"It is unacceptable for a meal to not have soup\" ().\n\nFermented fish sauce, known locally as \"shrimp oil\" (), is also commonly used in the cuisine, along with oyster, crab and shrimp. Peanuts (utilised for both savoury dishes and desserts) are also prevalent, and can be boiled, fried, roasted, crushed, ground or even turned into a paste. Peanuts can be used as a garnish, feature in soups and even be added to braised or stir-fried dishes.\n\nFujian cuisine has had a profound impact on Taiwanese cuisine and on the overseas Chinese cuisines found in Southeast Asia as the majority of Taiwanese and Southeast Asian Chinese people have ancestral roots in Fujian province.\n\nFujian cuisine consists of three styles:\n\nUnique seasonings from Fujian include fish sauce, shrimp paste, sugar, shacha sauce and preserved apricot. Wine lees from the production of rice wine is also commonly used in all aspects of the region's cuisine. Red yeast rice () is also commonly used in Fujian cuisine, imparting a rosy-red hue to the foods, pleasant aroma, and slightly sweet taste.\n\nFujian is also well known for its \"drunken\" (wine marinated) dishes and is famous for the quality of the soup stocks and bases used to flavour their dishes, soups and stews.\n\nOne of the most famous dishes in Fujian cuisine is \"Buddha Jumps Over the Wall\", a complex dish making use of many ingredients, including shark's fin, sea cucumber, abalone and Shaoxing wine.\n\nFujian is also notable for yanpi (), literally \"swallow skin,\" a thin wrapper made with large proportions of lean minced pork. This wrapper has a unique texture due to the incorporation of meat and has a \"bite\" similar to things made with surimi. Yanpi is used to make \"rouyan\" (), a type of wonton.\n\nThere are many eating places around the province that sell these specialties for two yuan, and which are thus known as \"two-yuan eateries\". In Xiamen, a local specialty is worm jelly (), an aspic made from a species of marine peanut worm.\n\n"}

{"id": "1958359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958359", "title": "CAMK", "text": "CAMK\n\nCAMK, also written as CaMK, is an abbreviation for the Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase class of enzymes. CAMKs are activated by increases in the concentration of intracellular calcium ions (Ca) and calmodulin. When activated, the enzymes transfer phosphates from ATP to defined serine or threonine residues in other proteins, so they are serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. Activated CAMK is involved in the phosphorylation of transcription factors and therefore, in the regulation of expression of responding genes. CAMK also works to regulate the cell life cycle (i.e. programmed cell death), rearrangement of the cell's cytoskeletal network, and mechanisms involved in the learning and memory of an organism.\n\nThere are 2 common types of CAM Kinase proteins: specialized and multi-functional CAM kinases.\n\n\nOnce calcium concentrations in the cell rise, CAM kinases become saturated and bind the maximum of four calcium molecules. This calcium saturation activates the kinase and allows it to undergo a conformational change which permits the kinase to bind to its phosphorylation target sites. CAMK removes a phosphate group from ATP, most typically using a Mg ion, and adds it to the CAM protein, rendering it active. The CAM Kinase contains a highly concentrated glycine loop where the gamma phosphate from the donor ATP molecule is easily able to bind to the enzyme which then utilizes the metal ion to facilitate a smooth phosphate transfer to the target protein. This phosphate transfer then activates the kinase's target and completes the phosphorylation cycle.\n\nFigure 1 shows how the presence of calcium or calmodulin allows for the activation of CAM kinases (CAMK II).\n\nAll kinases have a common structure of a catalytic core including an ATP binding site along with a larger substrate binding site. The catalytic core is typically composed of β-strands with the substrate binding site composed of α-helices. Most all CAM kinases includes a variety of domains, including: a catalytic domain, a regulatory domain, an association domain, and a calcium/calmodulin binding domain.\n\nCAMK I, as shown in Figure 2, has a double-lobed structure, consisting of a catalytic, substrate-binding domain and an autoinhibitory domain. For the autoinhibitory domain to become functional, it must cause the protein to conform in such a way that this domain completely blocks the substrate domain from taking in new targets. Figure 2 goes into detail showing the structure and domains of CAMK I.\n\nCAMK II has a variety of different forms, with CAMK 2A being the most common, as shown in Figure 3. CAMK 2A has a ring-like crystalline structure, composed of smaller functional groups. These groups allow for the CaM-dependent phosphorylation of targets, but also allows the structure to autophosphorylate itself and become CaM-independent, as seen in Figure 1. This means once the CAMK 2A protein is initially activated by calcium or calmodulin, it can, in turn, further activate itself, so it doesn't become inactive even when it is without calcium or calmodulin. \n\nMembers of the CAMK enzyme class include, but are not limited to:\n\n\nPseudokinases are pseudoenzymes, proteins that resemble enzymes structurally, but lack catalytic activity.\n\nSome of these pseudokinases that are related to the CAMK family include: \n"}

He fought during the First Barons' War and was present at the Battle of Lincoln (1217) alongside his father William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who led the English troops in that battle. He commissioned the first biography of a medieval knight to be written, called \"L'Histoire de Guillaume le Mareschal,\" in honour of his father\".\"\n\nWilliam was born in Normandy probably during the spring of 1190, the eldest son of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, and his wife, Isabel de Clare, suo jure 4th Countess of Pembroke and Striguil.\n\nHis early contract of marriage to Alice de Bethune in 1203 and his connections to Baldwin de Bethune the younger and the Aumale knight, Richard Siward, may indicate that he was at some time fostered with his father's ally, Baldwin, Count of Aumale. He was taken as hostage by King John after his father in 1205 paid homage to the enemy of England, King Philip II of France, and lived from the ages of 15 to 22 at the court of King John as a guarantor of his father's loyal behaviour. He was released from wardship upon his majority in 1212, and married in 1214. Alice being her father's sole heir enabled him to use her lands and influence to build up his own retinue of knights, which included Fulk fitzWarin, his first cousins, the four Le Gros brothers, and Baldwin de Bethune the younger, bastard brother of his wife.\n\nDuring the First Barons' War of 1215, William was on the side of the rebels supporting the claim of King Louis VIII of France while his father was fighting for the right of the English king. He was present at the meeting at Stamford in February 1215. In June he was one of the twenty-five executors of Magna Carta, and was consequently excommunicated by Innocent III on 11 December that year. When King Louis captured Worcester Castle in 1216, the younger William was helpfully warned by his father to flee from the castle, which he did just before Ranulph de Blondeville, 4th Earl of Chester retook it. In March 1217, he was absolved from excommunication and rejoined the royal cause. At the Battle of Lincoln in 1217 he was fighting alongside his father.\n\nHe was with his father when he died in 1219, succeeding him as both Earl of Pembroke and as Lord Marshal of England. These two powerful titles, combined with the elder Marshal's legendary status, made William one of the most prominent and powerful nobles in England. He also inherited the family properties in Normandy, but deeded them to his younger brother Richard by a charter dated 20 June 1220.\n\nIn 1223, William crossed over from his Irish lands to campaign against Llywelyn the Great, who had attacked his holding of Pembroke. He was successful, but his actions were seen as too independent by the regents of the young King Henry III; on 23 April 1224 William was married to Eleanor, sister of the King, in order to strengthen the Marshal family's connection with the Plantagenets. Hugh de Lacy began attacking Irish lands held by William together with the royal demesnes in that island. William was appointed as Justiciar of Ireland (1224-1226) and managed to subdue de Lacy. In 1225 he founded the Dominican Priory of the Holy Trinity in Kilkenny and began the construction of Carlow and Ferns castles. Due to his support of Aedh Ua Conchobair against Richard de Burgh in their claims to Connacht, he was dismissed as Justicar, surrendering office to the king at Winchester on 22 June 1226. Due to his continued support, he was later that year ordered to surrender to the crown the custody of the royal castles of Cardigan and Carmarthen which he had captured from Llywelyn.\n\nWilliam accompanied the king to Brittany in 1230, and assumed control of the forces when the king returned to England. In February 1231 William also returned to England, and arranged the marriage of his sister Isabel, widow of Gilbert de Clare, to Richard, Earl of Cornwall, brother to King Henry III.\n\nWilliam married twice, but produced no surviving children:\n\nWilliam died on 6 April 1231. Matthew Paris recorded that Hubert de Burgh, Justiciar of England, was later accused of poisoning William, but there are no other sources to support this. He was buried on the 15 of April in the Temple Church in London, next to his father, where his effigy may still be seen.\n\nWilliam was responsible for the commissioning of \"L'Histoire de Guillaume le Mareschal,\" the first known biography of a medieval knight, in order to record his father's extraordinary career. Based on oral and written testimony, it was completed in 1226.\n\nAs William had no surviving children, his titles passed to his younger brother Richard Marshal, 3rd Earl of Pembroke. His lack of male heirs was credited to a curse bestowed upon the family by the Bishop of Ferns, Ailbe Ua Maíl Mhuaidh. All of William's brothers inherited the title successively, but as the Bishop predicted, none had children and the male line of the family died out on the death of Anselm Marshal in 1245.\n"}

Howard lived with the owner of Blockhead in San Diego and stated in 2011, \"It was really fun living there and a lot of fun sessions, lot of different people coming through there, like Chris Miller that was awesome.\"\n\nFollowing Blockhead, Howard skated for Plan B Skateboards in 1991 and, during his time with Plan B, he left Gullwing and switched to Independent Trucks. His part in the second Plan B video, \"Virtual Reality\", is well known for his advancement of \"switch-stance\" skating (skateboarding with the opposite stance of that which a rider naturally adopts).\n\nThe \"fakie frontside big spin heelflip\" is named the \"Rick Flip\" or \"Howard Heel\"—the invention of this trick has been credited to Howard; however, Howard has publicly stated that he does not appreciate the recognition, as he does not believe that he is the trick's inventor.\n\nWhile Howard was filmed performing in skits for the 2012 Girl/Chocolate co-production \"Pretty Sweet\", he is not featured in the actual film.\n\nAs of December 2014, Howard is sponsored by Spitfire, Girl, Fourstar Clothing, Lakai Limited Footwear, Independent Trucks Glassy Sunhaters and Diamond Supply Co.\n\nAfter leaving Plan B, Howard formed a new company named Girl Skateboards with Spike Jonze, Carroll, and Megan Baltimore in 1993. When asked in a 2011 interview about what he sought to make different with the formation of Girl, in comparison to other companies, Howard replied:\nEveryone has a say. Efforts on everyone's part, so just a team effort. There was a lot of things going on at that time that it was the natural thing to do. It's not like people had plans and strategies and stuff like that. It's like these were the people we skated with that were good at the time ... It was just all a group thing, it still is. We all still put in the same efforts as we did the day we started. That was the main idea, that it's kind of a cooperative effort. Everyone has a say on the matter.\n\nHoward was sponsored by DC Shoes, where he had a signature model shoe, but left DC to form his own shoe company with Carroll, Lakai Limited Footwear.\n\nIn March 2013, Howard and Carroll conducted a video interview with the Active mail order company's YouTube channel, explaining the innovation of Howard signature model shoe that had been manufactured with a cup sole, as opposed to the vulcanized sole that Howard had preferred over the preceding five years. Howard explained that Carroll had managed to design a cup sole akin to a vulcanized sole, in addition to other technical aspects, and had therefore proceeded with the release of the design. Johnston stated in a March 2013 interview for the Independent Truck Company that the shoe design was his favorite Lakai design since working for the company.\n\nAs of 2011, Howard resides in California, US, after relocating there from Canada as a teenager.\n\nHoward's personal life is not covered in the skateboard media and his role in the industry has not been publicized—the Lakai website provides the following description of Howard: \"His role behind the scenes at Girl has been equally as important as his time on the board.\"\n\n\n"}

He fought in the American War of Independence and became a prominent figure of the French Revolutionary Wars and of the Napoleonic wars.\n\nBorn into a noble family of naval officers, Latouche enlisted at the age of 13. He rose to become a competent frigate captain, battling several British ships during the American War of Independence. His two-frigate squadron once manoeuvred a 74-gun ship of the line to the point of sinking, and he was entrusted with important personalities of the time as passengers, notably Louis XVI and the Marquis de Lafayette.\n\nDuring the Revolution, Latouche, a Freemason and aide to Phillipe Égalité, took progressive positions as a deputy in the Estates General and later in the National Constituent Assembly. His nobility nevertheless made him a target during the Reign of Terror, and he was imprisoned and only freed from prison by the Thermidorian Reaction.\n\nReturned to the Navy after a long period of unemployment, Latouche took command of the Flottille de Boulogne, where he repelled the Raids on Boulogne organised by Nelson. He then served in the Saint-Domingue expedition, which irrevocably compromised his health. After his return, he took command of the fleet in Toulon, reorganising it into a potent tool again, but he succumbed to a relapse of illness before he had a chance to use it. Under his successor Villeneuve, the fleet he had refurbished was crushed at the Battle of Trafalgar.\n\nLatouche was born in Rochefort-sur-mer, Charente-Maritime. His father, Louis-Charles Le Vassor de La Touche, had been the governor of Martinique, until the Invasion of 1762, and chief of the naval forces of Rochefort. His uncle, Charles-Auguste Levassor de La Touche-Tréville, served as a Rear-Admiral, commanding the light squadron of the France-Spanish fleet under Orvilliers in 1780.\n\nAt the age of 13, Latouche joined the Gardes de la Marine, and took part in numerous naval actions during the Seven Years' War. He started sailing on the \"Hardi\", ferrying troops to Canada in 1758, and took part in his first action, in 1759 aboard the 64-gun \"Dragon\", which was under his uncle's command, taking part in the Battle of Quiberon Bay. He also served on the pram \"Louise\" and harassed the blockading British squadron Île-d'Aix in October 1760, still under his uncle. In 1762 he served on the 74-gun \"Intrépide\" and on \"Tonnant\". In the summer of that year, Latouche was detached to command two gunboats with which he attacked two British ships, one 60-gun and one 74-gun, waging a two-hour battle.\n\nAfter the Treaty of Paris in 1763, Latouche took part in training campaigns under his uncle Latouche-Tréville and Admiral d'Estaing, serving on the ships \"Garonne\" in 1763, and \"Hardi\" and \"Bricole\" in 1765.\n\nIn September 1768, aged 23, he was promoted to Ensign. Perhaps under pressure from his family, who hoped for quicker promotions, or because the reform of the Navy forced him to retire, he resigned from the Navy and enlisted in the Army. He became an aide to Governor-General d'Ennery, newly appointed governor of Martinique, who obtained a commission as a cavalry captain for him. In 1771, he transferred as captain to the Régiment de La Rochefoucauld-Dragons, a dragoon regiment, and became Aide-de-camp to Governor General Valière, who commanded at Saint-Domingue.\n\nIn 1772, Navy Minister Boynes acceded to repeated requests from Latouche's family, and he was reinstated in the Navy as \"\"capitaine de brûlot\"\". Latouche was appointed to command the fluyt \"Courtier\". In 1774, Latouche put forward a proposition to the Ministry Navy for an exploratory expedition to circumnavigate Australia to see whether New Holland and New South Wales were separated by a channel; the plan was rejected, as the Ministry preferred using Île de France as the forward base for such an operation. Latouche corresponded with Captain Cook on exploration plans in 1775 and 1776.\n\nIn May 1777, he was promoted to Lieutenant and was given command of the 20-gun corvette \"Rossignol\", which escorted convoys and ferried messages. He captured two English privateers and three merchantmen. His prizes saw him appointed Knight of the Order of Saint-Louis. He was appointed commander of the 26-gun frigate \"Hermione\".\n\nOn 28 May 1779, \"Hermione\" spotted a British privateer, which she lured into a trap by feigning fleeing in the night. In order to induce a tiring chase, Latouche let his ship's beacon be glimpsed intermittently, before doubling back to attack his opponent in the morning. The privateer was the 18-gun \"Diffidence\", of Falmouth. The next day, another 18-gun privateer attacked and Latouche captured her too, using the same ruse. Latouche then returned to Rochefort with his two prizes and numerous prisoners.\n\nFrom 21 March to 28 April 1780, Latouche carried General Lafayette as a passenger on a transatlantic voyage from France to Boston. Then, joining the fleet under Rear-Admiral Destouches, and under orders from Barras and Ternay, he directed the building of several artillery batteries for the defence of Rhode Island.\n\nAfter he had completed the batteries, Latouche was allowed to cruise off Long Island and intercept shipping to New York City. He quickly captured two prizes, before spotting four sails on 7 June 1780: these were the frigate \"Iris\" and three lesser warships. In the ensuing Action of 7 June 1780, Latouche was himself shot in the arm by a musket ball, and \"Hermione\" suffered ten deaths and 37 wounded. His opponent, Captain James Hawker, later accused him of fleeing the scene, to which Latouche replied \"In my poor state, I could not pursue you. Why then did you not continue the fight?\"\n\nOn 16 March, Latouche-Tréville participated in the Battle of Cape Henry, which took place at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay. This action has led to a commonly repeated, but erroneous, report that Latouche-Tréville engaged in a \"battle against the \"Chesapeake\" (March 1781)\".\n\nOn 13 April 1781, Latouche's father, Louis-Charles Le Vassor de La Touche, died in Paris. Latouche inherited his title, and thereafter was styled \"Comte de Latouche\".\nHe then continued cruising off the coast of North America as part of a squadron under the command of Admiral Lapérouse, whose flagship was \"Astrée\".\n\nOn 21 July, the two frigates encountered a British convoy off the coast of New Scotland. In the resulting naval battle of Louisbourg, \"Astrée\" and \"Hermione\" forced HMS \"Charlestown\" to strike her colours, but failed to board her, allowing her to flee during the night. They did however capture the 14-gun escort, \"Jack\", and three merchantmen, which they brought to Boston.\n\nAfter returning to France, Latouche was promoted to Captain on 20 June 1781. In 1782, he was tasked with ferrying officials, large sums of money and equipment to America, leading a two-frigate squadron comprising \"Aigle\" and \"Gloire\", under Captain de Vallongue.\n\nLatouche assumed command of the frigate \"Aigle\" which, along with the \"Gloire\", ferried funds and equipment for the fleet of Admiral de Vaudreuil. On 5 September 1782, the squadron encountered the lone 74-gun HMS \"Hector\": in the ensuing two-day battle, the two frigates heavily damaged the \"Hector\", and only failed to captured her when a British squadron appeared on the horizon. Latouche retreated, and \"Hector\" foundered a few days later.\n\nThe frigates continued on their journey when, on 12 September, they spotted a British squadron, comprising two ships of the line with a frigate, two corvettes and a brig-sloop. Latouche captured the brig, . Latouche then tacked into the Delaware River, as , , and the prize \"Sophie\", led by Captain G.K. Elphinston in , gave chase. Latouche landed his passengers and treasure with launches from the frigates. He then attempted to escape his much stronger opponents by sailing over the banks at the mouth of the Delaware River, but \"Aigle\" ran aground; \"Gloire\" also touched bottom, but she managed to free herself and reach the channel. Latouche attempted to free \"Aigle\", but with the retreating tide, she became not only more and more firmly beached, but also fell on her side, rendering her battery unserviceable. Seeing his ship lost, Latouche had her the masts chopped off and her hull pierced; he then evacuated her crew; staying behind with only a few men, Latouche fired a few shots from his stern chasers before striking his colours. Despite the measures to disable \"Aigle\", the British were able to recover her and took her into service as HMS \"Aigle\".\n\nAdmiral Vaudreuil wrote to the Minister of the Navy Castrie:\nLatouche was taken as a prisoner to New York, and transferred from there to England. He remained a prisoner until the Treaty of Paris in 1783.\n\nUpon Latouche's return in France, he was appointed to direct Rochefort harbour. He was also tasked with drawing a map of Oléron, which was published in the first volume of \"Hydrographie française\". In 1784 he succeeded Bruni d'Entrecasteaux as vice-director of the Harbours and Arsenals, holding the position until 1787, when he became Chancellor to the Duke of Orléans. Meanwhile, he had also served as an inspector for the gunnery school of the Naval Academy, and co-authored the Naval Code for 1786. In July 1786, he sailed a corvette from Honfleur to Le Havre, ferrying king Louis XVI.\n\nHis uncle, Charles-Auguste Levassor de La Touche-Tréville, died in 1788 and bequeathed him his name; henceforth, Latouche added \"Tréville\" to his name, becoming the \"comte de Latouche-Tréville\".\nAt the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789, Latouche-Tréville was elected deputy of the Nobility for the bailiwick of Montargis; he went on to sit at the National Constituent Assembly and held this position until it adjourned on 10 October 1791. Latouche took a liberal posture and was among the first nobles to join forces with the Third Estate. In September 1791, after king Louis XVI approved the new constitution, the National Constituent Assembly disbanded, and Latouche-Tréville resumed his naval activities.\n\nLatouche had held the rank of Rear-Admiral since 20 December 1790 reform of the navy. In this capacity, in 1792 he took command of a four-ship squadron in Brest. He sailed from Brest to Toulon, on his flagship the \"Languedoc\", to attach his division to the Mediterranean squadron under Rear-admiral Truguet. He took part in raids against Oneglia, Cagliari and Nice during the , and joined in the attack on Sardinia in October 1792 (which turned out to be a failure when the expeditionary corps was repulsed). Latouche-Tréville and Truguet then returned to Toulon.\nLatouche-Tréville was promoted to Rear-Admiral on 1 January 1793. He was then sent on a mission to Napoli, after that kingdom's ambassador to Constantinople had precipitated a diplomatic conflict by insulting his French counterpart. Latouche threatened to bombard the city, and obtained apologies from Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies. Latouche then departed, but had to double back to Napoli to repair due to gale-force winds, eventually making his rendezvous with Truguet on 8 February 1793. On 14 February, they landed 6,000 volunteers at Cagliari, who had to reembark under fire and in a gale two days later. The fleet then returned to Toulon once more.\n\nIn March 1793, amid the War of the First Coalition, Latouche took command of the \"Naval Army of the Ocean\" (the Brest fleet), but as soon as he took up his position, revolutionary subordinates denounced him as an aristocrat. On 15 September, at the height of the Reign of Terror, he was arrested as a \"suspect\" on orders of the Committee of Public Safety, and cashiered on 3 October. He spent one year in La Force Prison, and was freed only on 20 September 1794, after the Thermidorian Reaction.\n\nFreed, Latouche returned to Montargis, where he was appointed chief of the Legion of the National Guard for the district. A Freemason, he rose to \"Vénérable\" in the Lodge \"Les Disciples d’Heredom et de la Madeleine Réunis\", of Montargis. Latouche was rehabilitated under the Directoire and had his rank reinstated in December 1795, but nonetheless was left for five years without a command in the Navy. From 1797 to 1798, he managed equipment for the Navy with a ship-owner friend, and by 1799 he had grown so desperate that he advertised in \"Le Moniteur Universel\" for privateer captainships. It was not until 1799 that he returned to active duty.\n\nIn 1799, Latouche was appointed to lead a naval division in Brest, with his mark on the 74-gun \"Mont-Blanc\". Soon after, he was appointed to command the full Brest fleet, and transferred his flag onto the 110-gun \"Terrible\". Latouche-Tréville defended the harbour until the government decided to disband the naval Army of Brest; Latouche-Tréville then sailed four of its ships to Rochefort.\nSoon after, advised by Navy minister Forfait, First Consul Bonaparte chose Latouche-Tréville to organise and lead the \"Flottille de Boulogne\". This vast fleet of small ships was ostensibly designed to ferry an invasion army to England, but was in fact a disinformation ploy to pressure the British into negotiating the Treaty of Amiens. The ploy helped to disguise the true goal of the French military, which was massing armies in Boulogne for an invasion of Austria. Soon after his arrival, on 4 August and 15 August 1801, Latouche-Tréville repelled the several British raids that Admiral Nelson launched to destroy the \"Flottille\".\n\nDuring the Peace of Amiens, Latouche-Tréville was appointed to command the naval squadron of Rochefort, comprising six ships of the line, six frigates and two corvettes, in the fleet of Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse, ferrying 3,000 men of the Army of Rhine for the Saint-Domingue expedition. Latouche fought his way into the harbour of Port-au-Prince, captured its forts and landed the troops. He and General Boudet captured Port-au-Prince and Léogâne. Latouche-Tréville managed to obtain the peaceful surrender of General Laplume, while, in the south, General Leclerc forced Toussaint L'Ouverture and Christophe to submit to French authority.\n\nWith Villaret de Joyeuse's departure in April 1802, Latouche-Tréville stayed in Saint-Domingue with four ships of the line, nine frigates and five corvettes. After the restoration of slavery on 20 May 1802, a new rebellion broke out, which overwhelmed the yellow-fever-stricken army of General Leclerc. Latouche-Tréville defended the harbours in the south, appointing Willaumez to the western naval station of Saint-Domingue. The situation grew even more desperate after the British started the War of the Third Coalition in May 1803: Willaumez had to return to France to repair his frigate, damaged in the Action of 28 June 1803, and the British effected a Blockade of Saint-Domingue that ended with the complete destruction of Rochambeau's army. In October 1803, Latouche-Tréville obtained free passage from the British due to his poor health, and returned to France.\n\nLatouche-Tréville was made a vice-Admiral in December 1803. Returned to France, he was appointed general inspector of the coasts of the Mediterranean, before taking command of the fleet of Toulon, with his flag on the brand-new 80-gun \"Bucentaure\". At the time, the squadron counted only seven ships of the line and four frigates, and discipline was much weakened; in particular, Navy officers slept aboard their ships only when forced to do so by their duty. Latouche-Tréville made a point to live on his ship, and morale quickly improved under his example and leadership.\n\nLatouche-Tréville decided to have one ship or frigate patrol for three days outside the harbour, in rotation, while another would always be ready to put to sail at the first signal. Furthermore, the entire squadron regularly scrambled to support the cruisers whenever superior British forces ventured into Toulon harbour, preventing the British from conducting useful reconnaissance of French activities in the area. Over the time, the squadron received three more ships of the line and three more frigates as reinforcements.\n\nIn late June 1804, Latouche-Tréville suffered a relapse of a medical condition contracted at Saint-Domingue. However, he constantly refused to transfer ashore, stating \"An admiral is only too glad when he can die under the flag of his ship.\" Indeed, after a 10-day struggle, on 19 August, Latouche-Tréville died aboard \"Bucentaure\". Lord Nelson later wrote:\nLatouche-Tréville was buried in Toulon graveyard. In 1810, a seven-metre-high pyramidal mausoleum was built at the Sémaphore de la Croix des Signaux, at Cape Cépet, from where Latouche-Tréville had observed the British in his last year. On 14 October 1902, military authorities decided to move the mausoleum to the military graveyard of Saint-Mandrier-sur-Mer; the body was transferred on 29 April 1903.\n\nFrench authors and historians often compared Latouche-Tréville to Nelson, partly because he fought and defeated him in the Raids on Boulogne, partly because, had it not been for his untimely death, he would have opposed Nelson at Trafalgar.\nThe name \"Latouche\" was inscribed on the north face of the Arc de Triomphe in his honour.\n\nThree ships of the French Navy have been named \"Latouche-Tréville\" in his honour: the steam aviso \"Latouche-Tréville\" in 1860; the armoured cruiser \"Latouche-Tréville\" in 1892; and the F70-type destroyer \"Latouche-Tréville\", presently in commission.\n"}
{"id": "1958403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958403", "title": "Wang Can", "text": "Wang Can\n\nWang Can (177–217), courtesy name Zhongxuan, was a Chinese politician and poet who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He contributed greatly to the establishment of laws and standards during the founding days of the vassal kingdom of Wei – the forerunner of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period – under the warlord Cao Cao, who was the \"de facto\" head of the Han central government in the final years of the Eastern Han dynasty. For his literary achievements, Wang Can was ranked among the Seven Scholars of Jian'an.\n\nWang Can was also renowned for his eidetic memory. The historical text \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\" described an incident where Wang Can was watching a game of \"weiqi\". Someone accidentally knocked into the board and scattered the pieces. Wang Can then placed the pieces back to their original positions based on memory.\n\nWang Can was from Gaoping County (), Shanyang Commandery (), which is around present-day Weishan County, Shandong. He was born in a family of high-ranking officials as a son of Wang Qian (), a Chief Clerk () to the general He Jin, who was briefly a regent for Emperor Shao in 189. Wang Can's great-grandfather, Wang Gong (), and grandfather, Wang Chang (), held offices among the Three Ducal Ministers during the reigns of Emperor Shun and Emperor Ling respectively.\n\nWhen the warlord Dong Zhuo usurped power in 189, placing on the throne the puppet ruler Emperor Xian, Wang Can was merely 13 years old. A year later, Dong Zhuo moved the imperial capital from Luoyang to the more strategically secure Chang'an. Wang Can then headed to Chang'an, where he settled down for the next three years. In Chang'an, the prominent scholar and calligrapher Cai Yong recognised Wang Can's talent and recommended him to the civil service. Wang Can received several offers to serve in the government but he turned down all of them.\n\nIn 194, Wang Can went to Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) to seek a position under the provincial governor, Liu Biao. However, Liu Biao did not favour Wang Can as the latter looked pallid and sickly. After Liu Biao died in 208, Wang Can persuaded his son and successor, Liu Cong, to surrender to Cao Cao, the warlord who controlled the Han central government at the time.\n\nWang Can's talents came to fruition during his service in Cao Cao's administration. In 213, after Emperor Xian enfeoffed Cao Cao as the Duke of Wei and granted him ten cities to form his dukedom, Cao Cao tasked Wang Can with establishing a new system of laws and standards to replace the old one, which had largely fallen into disuse. In late 216, Wang Can accompanied Cao Cao on his fourth campaign against a rival warlord, Sun Quan.\n\nWang Can died of illness on the way back to Ye city (in present-day Handan, Hebei) in the spring of 217 at the age of 41 (by East Asian age reckoning). Cao Cao's heir apparent, Cao Pi, attended Wang Can's funeral and told the guests, \"When he was still living, Wang Can loved the sounds of a donkey braying, so let's each make a braying sound as a farewell to him\". Every guest did that.\n\nWang Can had two sons, who were executed in 219 for participating in a rebellion led by Wei Feng against Cao Cao's government. Their deaths resulted in the termination of Wang Can's family line. However, Wang Ye (), a younger relative of Wang Can, was eventually designated as Wang Can's adopted son to continue his family line. Wang Ye inherited 10,000 of Wang Can's books and passed them on to his own sons, Wang Bi and Wang Hong ().\n\nWang Can was an established poet. Along with six other poets of his time, their poems formed the backbone of what was to be known as the Jian'an style (). They were collectively called the \"Seven Scholars of Jian'an\" (). \"Jian'an\" was the era name of Emperor Xian's reign from 196 to 220.\n\nThe civil strife towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty gave the Jian'an poems their characteristic solemn yet heart-stirring tone, while lament over the ephemerality of life was also a central theme of works from this period. In the history of Chinese literature, the Jian'an poems were a transition from the early folk songs into scholarly poetry. One of the representative works by Wang Can is the \"Poem of Seven Sorrows\" (), a five-character poem lamenting the suffering of the people during the years of war. Wang Can also wrote a history book called \"Records of Heroes\" ().\n\nMany anecdotes and stories related to Wang Can exist. It is recounted that when he was yet a youth, Wang Can went to visit Cai Yong, then a high-ranking official; and although many guests of exalted rank were present, the host hastened to welcome the newcomer with the greatest deference. The others were astonished and asked why he was so respectful to a mere youth. \"He is a young man with the highest gifts,\" said Cai Yong. The \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\" stated that Wang Can was widely read and had a most retentive memory, better than any of his contemporaries. If he glanced at a roadside monument as he passed, he remembered every word of the inscription. If he saw people playing \"weiqi\" and the board was suddenly disturbed, he could replace every piece in its correct place.\n\n\n"}

Mariano's first skateboard deck sponsor was Powell Peralta and he appeared in the company's video \"Ban This\", alongside Paulo Diaz, Rudy Johnson, and Gabriel Rodriguez.\n\nTogether with Mark Gonzales, Jason Lee, Jordan Richter, and Rudy Johnson, Mariano appeared in the Blind video, \"Video Days\", considered a classic achievement in skateboarding history. \"Skateboarder\" magazine brought together all of the video's members for a reunion article that celebrated twenty years since the video's release, while Gonzales has since been named the most influential skateboarder of all time by the \"Transworld Skateboarding\" magazine. Professional skateboarder, Paul Rodriguez explained in 2003 that he first saw \"Video Days\" in 1999 to better understand why his generation skated the way it did and also because the video inspired him to skateboard.\n\nMariano joined professional skateboarders Rodney Mullen, Jeron Wilson, Andrew Reynolds, Gershon Mosley, Ryan Wilburn, Heath Kirchart, and Mike York on a trip to Australia for the filming of a documentary entitled \"Canvas\". The film was co-directed by Mike Hill, part owner of Globe.\n\nFollowing Blind, Mariano joined the Girl Skateboards team and appeared in the video \"Mouse\" (1996). Since joining the Girl team, Mariano has appeared in every major Girl video production since the company's inception.\n\nFollowing a hiatus related to illicit drug use, Mariano returned to professional skateboarding in 2005. Mariano contributed a part in Lakai Limited Footwear's skateboarding video \"Fully Flared\" and won the \"Best Street\", \"Best Video Part\", and \"Readers Choice\" awards at the 2008 awards event that is presented annually by the \"Transworld Skateboarding\" magazine—the video itself won the \"Best Video\"award. Mariano did not present a pre-written speech after receiving any of the awards and was quoted as stating, \"I’m older than most of you so I’m going to cry.\" after his \"Best Street\" accolade and \"I love everybody! I love skateboarding\" following the announcement of the \"Best Video Part\" decision.\n\nIn 2012, Mariano appeared in \"Pretty Sweet\", a collaborative video between the Girl and Chocolate brands, and received the closing video part, a symbol of a video part's excellence (often referred to as the video's \"ender\"). Initially, Mariano was merely going to be featured in a montage section, but after he was encouraged by the video's filmer, Ty Evans, to \"focus more\" on his \"stuff\", Mariano eventually assembled enough footage for a full video part that features a number of tricks that were filmed in China. Mariano revealed in a 2012 interview that the filming process for the video was very physically intensive and \"ice baths, massage therapy and chiropractic adjustments\" were factors in the completion of the part. Following his \"Pretty Sweet\" video part, a level of anticipation developed in regard to the awarding of the Skater of the Year (SOTY) trophy to Mariano by \"Thrasher\" magazine and Gary Rogers, from the Internet show, \"Skateline\", was a significant contributor to this momentum—the award was eventually given to David González.\n\nMariano co-founded the Royal Trucks skateboard truck company with Rudy Johnson in 1999, and is also a part owner in the Fourstar clothing brand with Eric Koston.\n\nFollowing his return from an extended period of leave from professional skateboarding, Mariano received the awards for \"Best Street Skater\" and \"Best Video Part\" (for \"Fully Flared\") at the 10th Annual Transworld SKATEboarding Awards.\n\nMariano received the Best Video Part award again at the 15th Transworld award event for his closing part in the Girl/Chocolate co-production \"Pretty Sweet\".\n\nProfessional skateboarder Paul Rodriguez identified Mariano in his \"top ten\" list of favorite professional skateboarders in July 2013. Rodriguez stated: \"He’s just one of those guys that did legendary things that people who were there witnessed and you would just hear about. Then taking such a long hiatus and coming back from that better ever.\"\n\nMariano is an Italian-American and has revealed that, at the age of thirty-seven, professional skateboarding has led to significant difficulties in his personal life:\nI made a lot of sacrifices—I missed my mom’s birthdays, my girlfriend’s birthdays, Thanksgiving, Christmas, because I was on skate trips. I have to put a lot of my life on hold to be a skateboarder at this age. A lot of people are moving on in life and having babies and families, but I’m still not around every weekend. It can get a little old for the people around you in your life, you know?\n\nAn in-depth perspective on Mariano's personal history is covered in the \"Epicly Later'd\" segment that he filmed with Patrick O'Dell for the Vice web-based video channel.\n\n"}

After four years of being the only indoor team in Fort Wayne, the franchise folded and the Fort Wayne Fusion was established as part of the AF2 in 2007. \n\nAfter a failed year in AF2, the Freedom came back in 2008 with new ownership and continued through the 2009 season. In 2010, another indoor team, the Fort Wayne FireHawks, replaced the Freedom in the CIFL. \n\nThe owner of the second version of the Freedom was Bill Fahlsing. The Freedom played their home games at Allen County War Memorial Coliseum in Fort Wayne.\n\n The original Fort Wayne Freedom was a professional indoor football team. They were most recently a member of the United Indoor Football league (UIF), and played their home games at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum. In 2004, the Freedom set the single game record for attendance at 10,225.\n\n # = set single game indoor football attendance record with 10,225 fans.\n\n\nThe 2005 season was the best season in franchise history. This was the first year in the UIF, the team moved to the association, after two years in the NIFL. Finishing a league-best 14-2, and winning the UIF Midwest Division. In the first-round of the UIF playoffs. The Tennessee Valley Raptors upset Freedom 57-22.\nAs Matt Land left the Freedom to become head coach at Tri-State University in NCAA Division III. The Freedom selected offensive coordinator Dan Pifer to be their new head coach. Pifer would later serve as the offensive coordinator for NCAA Division III Tri-State, later renamed Trine, under former coach Matt Land. He had worked previously as an assistant coach at the University of St. Francis, an NAIA institution, and NCAA Division II Hillsdale College in Michigan. Pifer also was a high school assistant and played quarterback at the University of California in Pennsylvania. After completing its fourth year of football, the assets of the Freedom were sold to Jeremy Golden, who moved the franchise to AF2. Meanwhile, leaders with United Indoor Football did find an ownership group (that included investor Bill Bean) that also sought a lease with Randy Brown and the Memorial Coliseum. Brown opted to go with the AF2 franchise.\n\nThe team had been heavily rumored to move to AF2 for quite some time, and Coffey sold the assets to Golden on November 10, 2006. Golden had already applied for and was awarded an AF2 franchise, but because only the assets and not the Freedom's corporate entity were sold, the Fort Wayne Fusion AF2 franchise is not a continuation of the UIF team.\n\nIn October 2007, the group Fort Wayne Sports Partners owned by Todd Ellis, John Christener and Mike McCaffrey, adopted the name Freedom as a new franchise in 2008. Only the name, and some players from the 2003–2006 teams were associated with the original franchise.\n. The team also announced that Eddie Brown, who had coached the Fusion the season before, would be the head coach for the Freedom, who would be joining the Continental Indoor Football League. Since the Fusion ownership had failed mid season in 2007, Brown and McCaffrey made majority owner Todd Ellis guaranteed them both that if the team ran into financial trouble they would not be responsible for any of the unpaid bills. The teams poor financial history left every part of owning the franchise more difficult, even as far as ownership of the team's turf. The team's new ownership also showed signs of financial trouble right away, as they were banned from the CIFL in January 2008, for failing to pay league dues. These troubles made Brown and McCaffrey question the ownership, and Ellis fired them both, replacing Brown with Willie Davis Jr. and McCaffrey with himself. The Freedom were able to work out a deal with CIFL Commissioner, Jeff Spitaleri, and paid their $22,500 league fee, which removed the ban and allowed the team to join the CIFL in 2008.\n\nIn September, 2008, the Freedom announced that former Freedom Assistant GM Brad Harris (who was with the original Freedom from 2003–2005) had been hired as GM. Head coach Matt Land also returned for the 2009 to coach the team for the full season.\n\nIn 2008, Land, who had been the team's head coach for the 2005 campaign, was asked by team co-owner William Fahlsing to lead the team for the final four games of the season when original head coach Willie Davis, Jr. was fired the morning of the May 17 game against the Chicago Slaughter. With only 15 minutes of practice, Land's second term began with a 41-33 loss to the Slaughter, despite a solid performance by the Freedom defense.\n\nIn 2009, the Freedom had success on the field but struggled financially. Toward the end of the 2009 season players were not paid promptly and then not at all. Team Co-owners Bill Fahlsing and Mark Chappius were forced to ask for public support to help get the team through the season. Despite the financial issue with salaries, the players continued to play for the Freedom and won the Eastern Conference Championship over the Marion Mayhem but lost the 2009 CIFL championship game to the Chicago Slaughter.\n\nThe Freedom Force is the official fan club of the Fort Wayne Freedom.\n\n\"Note: Statistics are correct through the end of the 2009 Continental Indoor Football League season.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1958413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958413", "title": "Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance", "text": "Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance\n\nThe Red Sea–Dead Sea Conveyance, sometimes called the Two Seas Canal, is a planned pipeline that runs from the coastal city of Aqaba by the Red Sea to the Lisan area in the Dead Sea. It will provide potable water to Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories, bring water with a high concentration of salts resulting from the desalination process (reject brine) to stabilise the Dead Sea water level, and generate electricity to support the energy needs of the project. The project is going to be carried out by Jordan and is entirely in Jordanian territory. The project will be financed by the governments of Jordan, Israel, and a number of international donors.\n\nThe water level in the Dead Sea is shrinking at a rate of more than one metre per year, and its surface area has shrunk by about 30% in the last 20 years. This is largely due to the diversion of over 90% of the water of the Jordan River. In the early 1960s, the river moved 1.5 billion cubic metres of water every year from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea. Dams, canals, and pumping stations built by Israel, Jordan and Syria now divert water for crops and drinking, and have reduced the flow to about 100 million cubic metres a year (MCM/yr), and even that mainly brackish water and sewage. \n\nThe decline of the Dead Sea level is creating major environmental problems, including sink holes and receding sea shores. Other routes for a conduit for the same objectives as the Red - Dead Conduit, including the Mediterranean–Dead Sea Canal, were proposed in Israel in the 1980s, but were discarded. The project costs $10 billion in all of its phases, with the first phase, which is slated to begin construction in 2021, will cost $1.1 billion. The Jordanian government is currently in the process of shortlisting consortiums and waiting for the final feasibility study, for which international funding would follow.\n\nThe connection of the seas by canal was first suggested in the mid-19th century by British officers who were looking for ways to circumvent the French-built Suez Canal and had not realized that the level of the Dead Sea is much lower. Later on, at the end of the 19th century, planners thought how to use the Jordan River water for irrigation and to bring sea water to the Dead Sea to create energy from its position of -390 m below sea level. One of those planners was the Zionist leader Theodor Herzl. The Red Sea-Dead Sea conduit was proposed at the end of the 1960s and was analysed as part of the peace process between Israel and Jordan. In the late 1990s a team headed by Refael (Rafi) Benvenisti working with Minister Shimon Peres as the Minister of Regional Cooperation suggested to establish the stabilization of the Dead Sea water level ('Saving the Dead Sea') as a major objective of the project. It suggested building the project in stages in order to test the mixing of the two seas water phasing the big investment associated with the project. The project was called \"the Peace conduit\" and was proposed to be located on Jordanian territory for financial and implementation reasons.\n\nOn May 9, 2005 Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian Authority signed an agreement to go ahead with a feasibility study for the Two Seas Canal. The agreement was signed on the Dead Sea by Jordanian Water Minister Raed Abu Soud, Israeli Infrastructure Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and Palestinian Planning Minister Ghassan al-Khatib.\n\nIn June 2009, after a meeting with World Bank President Robert Zoellick, the Israeli Regional Cooperation Minister, Silvan Shalom, announced a pilot project to build a \"pilot\" pipe 180 km long from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea. The pipe would pump 200 million cubic metres per year. Half of this would be desalinated for Jordanian consumption and half put into the Dead Sea.\n\nIn October 2009 the Jordanian government announced that it would unilaterally tender a Jordan Red Sea Project (JRSP). According to the government, this project could be considered as the first phase of the Red Sea–Dead Sea Project. The project is to be implemented by a private company under authority granted by the government. The project would also serve as an economic development project to create housing for 1.36 million people south of Amman, at the Southern end of the Dead Sea, north of Aqaba and in gated communities. Also, several tourist resorts would be created. It is divided into five phases. The first phase would include extraction of 400 million cubic metres of seawater per year, resulting in 210 million cubic metres/year (MCM/yr) of freshwater and 190 million cubic metres/year for discharge into the Dead Sea. The construction of the first phase is expected to take 7 years. In March 2011 the Ministry of Water and Irrigation short-listed six firms for the first phase of the project.\n\nThe World Bank has announced that it would release a feasibility study of water conveyance from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea together with an environmental and social assessment as well as a study of alternatives in early 2012 (see the drafts - ). The alternatives studied include a restoration of the Jordan River to its natural flow and taking no action, as well as numerous other alternatives.\n\nIn August 2013, Jordanian government announced that it would move ahead with the first phase of a project. On December 9, 2013, an agreement to build the pipeline was signed by Israel, Jordan and Palestine. On June 21, 2016, Jordan announced that it received 17 bids from international firms to construct the canal.\n\nOn 27 November 2016, it was announced that the Jordanian government is shortlisting five consortiums to implement the project. Jordan's ministry of Water and Irrigation said that the $100 million first phase of the project will begin construction in the first quarter of 2018, and will be completed by 2021.\n\nThe proposed conveyance would pump seawater 230 meters uphill from the Red Sea's Gulf of Aqaba through the Arabah Valley in Jordan. The water would then flow down gravitationally through multiple pipelines to the area of the Dead Sea, followed by a drop through a penstock to the level of the Dead Sea near its shore, and then an open canal to the Sea itself, which lies about 420 meters below sea level. The project would utilize about 225 km of pipelines for seawater and brine, parallel to the Arabah Valley in Jordan. \nThe project would also have about 178 km of freshwater pipelines to the Amman area. It also would include several water desalination plants and at least one hydroelectric plant. In its final phase, it would produce about 850 million cubic meters of freshwater per year. \n\nThe project would require electric power from the Jordanian power grid, but it would also provide some electricity through hydroelectric power. In the sum, this project would probably be a large net user of energy . The net power demand would have to be satisfied through other power projects whose costs are not included in the project costs. The Kingdom of Jordan plans to build a large nuclear power plant that might make up the difference.\n\nThe project cost estimates vary from two to more than ten billion dollars depending on its structure and stages. The first phase of the Jordan Red Sea Project is expected to cost US$2.5 billion. It is expected to be financed to a large extent from commercial sources, including debt and equity and from soft international financing. As of January 2019, Israel is expected to contribute over one billion dollars over a period of 25 years.\n\nThe transfer of mass volumes of water from one sea to another can bear drastic consequences on the unique natural characteristics of each of the two seas, as well as the desert valley which separates them, the Arabah. Some of these characteristics, especially in the Dead Sea area, are unique on a global perspective, and therefore crucially important for conservation. The environmental group EcoPeace Middle East (previously known as Friends of the Earth Middle East) has protested against the allegedly premature approval of the project, without sufficient assessment of the project's impact on the natural environment of the area. The group lists several potential hazardous effects of the project on the unique natural systems of the Red Sea, the Dead Sea and the Arabah. These potential effects include:\n\nIsraeli environmental NGOs say that the reestablishment of the Jordan River to its natural state was a better solution to the decline of the Dead Sea than the proposed canal.\n\nThe World Bank Study included environmental assessments carried out under the supervision of the World Bank by world-renowned experts found that the environmental risks of the project are manageable if the project is well planned and executed:\n\n1. Damage to the unique natural system of the Dead Sea, due to mixing its water with Red Sea water. The report of: Tahal Group, The Geological Survey of Israel (GSI), Portland State University - Oregon, USA and Institute of Life Sciences - The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, stated:\n2. Damage to the coral reefs of the Gulf of Aqaba, due to water pumping. The report of: Thetis SpA, The Interuniversity Institute For Marine Sciences In Eilat, Marine Science Station University of Jordan and Yarmouk University, Aqaba and Israel Oceanographic and limnological Research institute, stated: \n3. Damage to the natural landscape and ecosystem of the Arabah and threats to archeological heritage sites due to construction and increased humidity caused by the open canal segments. According to the preferred scenario of the World Bank Study the conduit will be multiple buried pipelines and not canals. Special care will be taken to minimize the environmental and archeological damage.\n\n4. Damage to the aquifers of the Arabah due to contamination of groundwater with water from the Red Sea. The planning and construction of the pipelines will include measures to minimize the potential for pipeline ruptures.\n\nIn 2006, the proposal has also generated some concern by the chairman of Egypt's Suez Canal Authority, which believed that the canal will increase seismic activity in the region, provide Israel with water for cooling its nuclear reactor near Dimona, develop settlements in the Negev Desert, and increase well salinity. However, as proposed, most of the desalinated water is expected to be used by Jordan and the Palestinians. Under the current proposal, water sufficient only to prevent the Dead Sea from dehydrating will flow through the system, preventing salt water flow into wells. The World Bank study recommended re-routing the conduit to avoid the geological faults of the Araba Valley.\n\n\n"}

However its principle of operation is instead based on the interference of light which has passed through a coil of optical fibre, which can be as long as .\n\nTwo beams from a laser are injected into the same fibre but in opposite directions. Due to the Sagnac effect, the beam travelling against the rotation experiences a slightly shorter path delay than the other beam. The resulting differential phase shift is measured through interferometry, thus translating one component of the angular velocity into a shift of the interference pattern which is measured photometrically.\n\nBeam splitting optics launches light from a laser diode into two waves propagating in the clockwise and anticlockwise directions through a coil consisting of many turns of optical fibre. The strength of the Sagnac effect is dependent on the \"effective area\" of the closed optical path: this is not simply the geometric area of the loop but is enhanced by the number of turns in the coil. The FOG was first proposed by Vali and Shorthill in 1976. Development of both the passive interferometer type of FOG, or IFOG, and a newer concept, the passive ring resonator FOG, or RFOG, is proceeding in many companies and establishments worldwide.\n\nA FOG provides extremely precise rotational rate information, in part because of its lack of cross-axis sensitivity to vibration, acceleration, and shock. Unlike the classic spinning-mass gyroscope or resonant/mechanical gyroscopes, the FOG has no moving parts and doesn't rely on inertial resistance to movement. Hence, the FOG is an excellent alternative to a mechanical gyroscope. Because of their intrinsic reliability and long lifetime, FOGs are used for high performance space applications and military inertial navigation systems.\n\nThe FOG typically shows a higher resolution than a ring laser gyroscope.\n\nFOGs are implemented in both open-loop and closed-loop configurations.\n\nLike all other gyroscope technologies and depending on detailed FOG design, FOGs may require initial calibration (determining which indication corresponds to zero angular velocity). \n\nSome FOG designs are somewhat sensitive to vibrations. However, when coupled with multiple-axis FOG and accelerometers and hybridized with GNSS data, the impact is mitigated, making FOG systems suitable for high shock environments, including gun pointing systems for 105mm and 155mm howitzers.\n\n\n\n"}

The film follows a hotel manager ensnared in an assassination plot by a terrorist while aboard a red-eye flight to Miami. The film score was composed and conducted by Marco Beltrami. It was distributed by DreamWorks Pictures and was released on August 19, 2005. The film received positive reviews from critics and fans of Craven's work and was a box office success. An extended version of the film, which added previously unused footage to increase the running time, was broadcast on the ABC network several times.\n\nHotel manager Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) arrives at Dallas Love Field to take a red-eye flight back to Miami, Florida. She meets a handsome young man named Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy), also traveling to Miami. While waiting to board, they share a drink at the airport bar and engage in small talk.\n\nLisa is surprised to find that Jackson is seated beside her. After takeoff, Jackson's charming demeanor quickly turns sinister as he informs Lisa that he works for a domestic terrorist organization planning to assassinate Charles Keefe (Jack Scalia), the current United States Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security. Lisa's managerial position at the Lux Atlantic Hotel in Miami, where Keefe and his family are staying, is crucial to their plot. As Acting Manager, Lisa must make a call from the in-flight phone to order the Keefe family be moved to a targeted room where a missile launched from a boat in the harbor will strike. Her non-compliance will result in Jackson's hitman accomplice killing Lisa's father, Joe (Brian Cox).\n\nWhile Jackson is distracted, Lisa writes a warning inside the self-help book she had previously given away to a friendly fellow-passenger (Angela Paton). Jackson head-butts Lisa unconscious and retrieves the book before the woman reads the message. She revives half an hour later and is forced to make the call to the hotel. When a storm disrupts the sky phone service mid-conversation with her co-worker, Cynthia (Jayma Mays), Lisa pretends to be ordering the room change until Jackson catches on. She then persuades Jackson to let her use the restroom while the phone service is still disrupted. Lisa writes a fake bomb threat in soap on the mirror; Jackson, checking on her, sees it and angrily wipes it off, then roughs her up in the restroom. A young girl waiting outside becomes suspicious and tells the flight attendant that Jackson is inside with Lisa, but it is dismissed as a sexual escapade.\n\nWhen the sky phones are operational again, Lisa calls Cynthia and has her move the Keefe family to the targeted suite. She then pleads with Jackson to call off the accomplice waiting outside her father's house, but he refuses until the assassination is confirmed.\n\nAs the plane lands at Miami International Airport, Lisa reveals that the knife scar Jackson noticed on her upper chest was due to a violent rape at knife point two years earlier and which she swore would never happen again. She then stabs Jackson in the throat with a ballpoint pen, grabs his phone, and flees the plane and terminal. Once outside, Lisa steals an unattended SUV. She calls Cynthia, telling her to evacuate the hotel and warn the Keefes. Cynthia, the Keefes, and U.S. Secret Service agents escape seconds before a Javelin missile hits the room.\n\nThe cell phone's battery dies as Lisa is calling her father. Arriving at his house and seeing the assassin at the front door, she hits and kills him with the car when he shoots at her with a suppressed pistol. Lisa's father is unharmed and has called 9-1-1. Lisa calls Cynthia, unaware Jackson arrived and incapacitated her father. Jackson pursues Lisa throughout the house. As they struggle, he throws her down the staircase. Lisa, stunned, retrieves the dead hitman's gun and shoots Jackson. Wounded, he disarms Lisa and is about to kill her when a revived Joe shoots Jackson with the gun. Lisa returns to the hotel to provide assistance where Keefe praises both women for their actions.\n\n\"Red Eye\" opened theatrically on August 19, 2005, in 3,079 venues, earning $16,167,662 in its opening weekend, ranking second in the domestic box office behind \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" ($21,422,815). At the end of its run, eight weeks later (on October 13), the film grossed $57,891,803 in the United States and Canada, and $37,685,971 overseas for a worldwide total of $95,577,774. Based on a $26 million budget, the film was a box office success.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 79% based on 193 critics, with an average rating of 6.68/10. The site's consensus states: \"With solid performances and tight direction from Wes Craven, \"Red Eye\" is a brisk, economic thriller.\" On Metacritic, the film received a weighted score of 71 out of 100, based on 36 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nPeter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" gave the film a 3.5/4 stars calling it the \"best thriller of summer 2005\" and a \"gripping suspense [that] will pin you to your seat\".\n\nRoger Ebert commended the film, calling it a \"good thriller\" that moves \"competently [and] relentlessly\". He praised Craven for making the film \"function so smoothly\" and \"doing exactly what it was intended to do\". Ebert also expressed admiration for the performances of McAdams and Murphy, stating that they are \"very effective together\". He said that McAdams is \"so convincing because she keeps [her performance] at ground level\" and \"she remains plausible even when the action ratchets up around her\". He also complimented Murphy for his \"ability to modulate his character instead of gnashing the scenery\". He gave the film 3/4 stars.\n\nManohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" called the film a \"nifty, tense thriller\" and said that the casting of the two leads is \"a nice surprise\". She said that Murphy is \"a picture-perfect villain\" and McAdams has a \"depth of intensity\" that is uncommon.\n\n\"USA Today\" film critic Claudia Puig said the film is \"fun to watch because of the strong performances\". She praised McAdams for blending \"vulnerability and courage\" to her performance and called Murphy \"menacing\". While she mentioned that the film is \"tense, smart, and nerve-wracking\" and \"entertaining and scary\" on the first hour, she criticizes the film for going \"downhill\" and becoming a \"by-the-book action flick\".\n\n\"Variety\"'s Robert Koehler stated that \"\"Red Eye\" relies on hoodwinking an audience with its tension, so that the sheer illogic of the conspiracy plot can slip by without detection\" but complimented McAdams for finding \"new and interesting ways of silently projecting fear\".\n\nWesley Morris of \"The Boston Globe\" felt the film was like a \"poor cousin of an episode of \"24\". Call it 12.\"\n\nIn October 2006, the film ranked 25th in the \"30 Even Scarier Movie Moments\", a follow up to Bravo's \"The 100 Scariest Movie Moments\" which was aired in October 2004.\n\n"}

With its collections currently comprising around 10.36 million books (as of 2016), it ranks among the best research libraries worldwide. Moreover, its historical stock encompasses one of the most important manuscript collections of the world, the largest collection of incunabula worldwide, as well as numerous further important special collections.\n\nThe legal deposit law has been in force since 1663, regulating that two copies of every printed work published in Bavaria have to be submitted to the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek. This law is still applicable today. The Bayerische Staatsbibliothek furthermore is Europe's second-largest journals library (after the British Library). The BSB publishes the specialist journal Bibliotheksforum Bayern and has been publishing the Bibliotheksmagazin together with the Berlin State Library since 2007. Its building is situated in the Ludwigstrasse.\n\n\nIn 2016, the library counted 69,500 registered users and 1,460,000 loans. The reading rooms of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek are used by around 3,000 readers every day. In the general reading room, open daily from 8 AM to 12 PM, approximately 111,000 volumes, primarily reference works, are freely accessible. In the periodicals reading room around 18,000 topical issues of current periodicals are available. The departments of manuscripts and early printed books, maps and images, music, as well as Eastern Europe, Orient and East Asia have their own reading rooms with open-access collections. Every day approximately 1,500 volumes are collected from the repositories and provided for use in the general reading room.\nIn 2010, a new research reading room was opened, focusing on Historical Sciences and Bavarian History and Culture (Aventinus Reading Room).\n\n\n\nSince April, 1st 2015 Klaus Ceynowa is director general of the Bavarian State Library. The head office, the assistant to the directors, the office of corporate counsel, the information technology department and the public relations department are also part of the directorate.\n\nDirectors general:\n\nThe central administration is in charge of general administrative management; moreover, it acts as a service provider for all areas of the library. The department is responsible for the areas \"budget\", \"human resources\" and \"internal services, construction\".\n\nThis department acquires all types of media (in the form or by way of presents, purchase, licensing, deposit copies and swapping items), and catalogues and indexes them both formally and according to subject. The Munich Digitisation Centre is a section of the department. It handles the digitisation and online publication of the cultural heritage preserved by the Bavarian State Library and by other institutions. It provides one of the largest and fastest growing digital collections in Germany. The department is also responsible for conservation and collection care. This division protects the media published from the year 1850 onward against damage and decay. It secures their long-term availability.\n\nThe user services department acts as an agent of the collections and services of the library. The department consists of the divisions of document provision, document administration, document delivery and information- and reading-room services.\n\nThe department of manuscripts and early printed books is responsible for the most valuable historical collections of the library. The worldwide renown of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek is founded on this precious heritage. The department has a separate reading room that is specially equipped for working with old books.\n\nThis department administrates printed maps from the year 1500 up to the present, atlases, cartographic material and the image archive of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek. The image archive also includes parts of the archives of Heinrich Hoffmann, Bernhard Johannes and Felicitas Timpe. The Map Collection and Image Archive also have - together with the department of music - their own reading room.\n\nThe Department of Music ranks among the world's leading music libraries, due to both the quantity and quality of its historical collections and its broad acquisition profile. Its beginnings date back to the 16th century. The area of collection emphasis \"musicology\" of the German Research Foundation is overseen by this department. A special reading room for music, maps and images is provided for the library users.\n\nThe oriental collections of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek comprise 260,000 volumes in Arabic, Armenian, Georgian, Hebrew, Yiddish, Mongolian, Persian, Tibetan and Indian languages. The East-Asian collections comprise more than 310,000 volumes in the Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai and Vietnamese languages. Users can avail themselves of the open-access collections in the east reading room occupied together with the department of Eastern Europe.\n\nThe department of Eastern Europe is the largest special department of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, holding around one million books about and from Eastern Europe, from early modern times up to the 21st century. In addition to the eastern European area, it also addresses eastern central and south-eastern Europe as well as the Asian part of Russia. The open-access collection of the department is accommodated in the library's east reading room.\n\nThe departments in charge of tasks predominantly allocated to a regional level are the Bayerische Bibliotheksschule (Bavarian School of Library and Information Science), the Landesfachstelle für das öffentliche Bibliothekswesen (Consulting Centre for Public Libraries) as well as the head office of the Bibliotheksverbund Bayern (Bavarian Library Network).\n\nThe Bavarian regional state-funded libraries form part of Bavaria's academic library system. They are subordinated to the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in the organisation structure. Among these libraries are the state libraries of Amberg, Ansbach, Neuburg an der Donau, Passau and Regensburg, the Studienbibliothek Dillingen, the Landesbibliothek Coburg, the Bamberg State Library () as well as the Hofbibliothek Aschaffenburg.\n\nThe library was founded in 1558 as the court library of Duke Albrecht V, and was originally located in the vaulted chamber of the Alter Hof (old court) of the Munich residence. Initially, two book collections were acquired: on the one hand the personal papers of the Austrian jurist, orientalist and imperial chancellor Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter, consisting of oriental manuscripts and prints, editions of classic authors and works from the areas of theology, philosophy und jurisprudence, and on the other hand the collection of the Augsburg patrician Johann Jakob Fugger, which was acquired in 1571. Fugger had commissioned agents to collect volumes of manuscripts and printed works in Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. In the end the works collected in this way amounted to more than 10,000 volumes. At the same time, he had had manuscripts copied in Venice.\n\nApart from this, in 1552 Fugger had purchased the collection of manuscripts and incunabula of the physician and humanist Hartmann Schedel, representing one of the richest humanistic private libraries north of the Alps. The Fugger collection was first administrated and organised by the physician Samuel Quichelberg from Antwerp. He had adopted the shelving system of the Augsburg court library. Later the collection was administered by the librarian Wolfgang Prommer, who had catalogued the collection both alphabetically and according to keywords. Aegidius Oertel from Nuremberg became the first librarian in 1561. The main users of the library were the Jesuits, who had been invited to Munich in 1559.\n\nWilliam V continued the collection, making further purchases:\nIn 1600 the collection comprised 17,000 volumes.\n\nThe secularization of Bavaria and the transfer of the court library of the Electorate of the Palatinate around the year 1803 added approximately 550,000 volumes and 18,600 manuscripts to the library's holdings.\n\nIn 1827 Friedrich von Gärtner was commissioned to plan a representative building for the court- and state library. The original plan was to erect the building at Ludwigstrasse 1. In 1828 the plot opposite the Glyptothek on Königsplatz was chosen as location, but later in the same year the planners switched back again to Ludwigstrasse. The blueprints were completed in 1831. For lack of funds the laying of the foundation stone had to be postponed to 8 July 1832. The construction work on the building planned by Gärtner was concluded in 1843.\n\nIn 1919 the library received the name that it still bears today: Bayerische Staatsbibliothek.\n\nDuring the Second World War more than 500,000 volumes were lost, although the collections were partly evacuated from the building. Some of the books were for example stored in the palace chapel of Schloss Haimhausen. Of the building itself 85% were destroyed. The reconstruction of the library building and the reintegration of evacuated holdings started in 1946.\n\n1953-1966 the professors Hans Döllgast und Sep Ruf had to plan and realize the reconstruction of the eastern wing, a new area behind historic walls, and the extension building of the Bavarian State Library, a glass- steel frame construction for the bibliotheca. They made an available surface of 17.000 m² and a cubature of 84.000 m³. 1967 a jury with Hans Scharoun gave the price of the BDA Bayern to the extension building. The inauguration of the restored south wing of the building in 1970 marked the conclusion of the reconstruction work on the building.\n\nThe Speicherbibliothek Garching (book repository) was inaugurated in 1988.\n\nThe Bayerische Staatsbibliothek has also initiated large-scale internet projects. In 1997 the Munich Digitization Center took up work and the BSB started developing its web portals, including its own web site. The card catalogue 1841-1952 and the catalogue of incunabula 1450-1500 were converted, thus making the complete holdings of printed materials of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek available online. The service \"Digitisation on Demand\", offered by a network of several European libraries, makes millions of books published between 1500 and 1900 available in digital form.\n\nOn 7 March 2007 Director General Rolf Griebel announced that Google Book Search will take over the digitisation of the copyright-free holdings of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek. In 2008, the year of its 450th anniversary, the Deutscher Bibliotheksverband (German Library Association) awarded the title of Bibliothek des Jahres (Library of the year) to the BSB.\n\nIn 2012 an Italian scholar discovered among Johann Jakob Fugger's manuscripts in the library an 11th-century Greek codex containing 29 ancient homilies, previously unpublished, by the theologian Origen of Alexandria.\n\nSince 2003 the Bavarian State Library has gone to great efforts to restitute illegally-acquired library material. The most recent example is the restitution of the so-called Plock Pontifical to Poland in April 2015. It had been stolen by the Nazis from the Plock Bishopric in 1940 and was taken to the Koenigsberg University. The Bavarian State Library bought the manuscript in 1973 for 6,200 DM at an auction in Munich. In the past years, the library has searched through those segments of its collections that are in question for illegitimate purchases. All in all, over 60,000 books have been meticulously checked so far. The library has identified around 500 books whose acquisition is to be regarded as unlawful. Subsequently, to these findings, several restitutions have taken place, amongst others the Bavarian State Library returned 78 volumes originating from Thomas Mann’s research library to the Thomas Mann Archive in Zürich in 2007. Further restitutions are in preparation, for example 252 books from the former publishing house Geca Kon.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1958440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958440", "title": "Nicolaus of Damascus", "text": "Nicolaus of Damascus\n\nNicolaus of Damascus (Greek: , \"Nikolāos Damaskēnos\"; Latin: \"Nicolaus Damascenus\") was a Jewish historian and philosopher who lived during the Augustan age of the Roman Empire. His name is derived from that of his birthplace, Damascus. He was born around 64 BC. Nicolaus is known to have had a brother named Ptolemy, who served in the court of Herod as a type of book-keeper or accountant.\n\nHe was an intimate friend of Herod the Great, whom he survived by a number of years. He was also the tutor of the children of Mark Antony and Cleopatra (born in c.68 BC), according to Sophronius. He went to Rome with Herod Archelaus, to defend the young man's claim to the throne upon the death of his father Herod the Great.\n\nGiven that Book 4 of his History was on Abraham, Nicolaus was most likely a Jew, though one who had been thoroughly Hellenised. As such, he may well have known his contemporary Philo of Alexandria. Since Nicolaus wrote a work On the Psyche, he may well have been, like Philo, in the school of the Pythagoreans or Platonists and been part of the syncretisation of Judaic monotheism with the monotheism (the Monad/The Good) of those two schools.\n\nHis output was vast, but is nearly all lost. His chief work was a universal history in 144 books. He also wrote an autobiography, a life of Augustus, a life of Herod, some philosophical works, and some tragedies and comedies.\n\nThere is an article on him in the Suda.\n\nTowards the end of his life he composed a universal history in 144 books, although the Suda mentions only 80 books. But references to books 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, (8), 96, 103, 104, 107, 108, 110, 114, 123 and 124 are known.\n\nExtensive fragments of the first seven books are preserved in quotation in the \"Excerpta\" compiled at the order of Constantine Porphyrogenitus. These cover the history of the Assyrians, Medes, Greeks, Lydians, and Persians, and are important also for Biblical history.\n\nJosephus probably used this work for his history of Herod (\"Ant.\" 15-17) because where Nicolaus stops, in the reign of Herod Archelaus, the account of Josephus suddenly becomes more cursory.\n\nFor portions dealing with Greek myth and oriental history he was dependent on other, now lost works, of variable quality. Where he relied on Ctesias, the value of his work is slim. Robert Drews has written:\n\nWe have considerable remains of two works of his old age; a life of Augustus, and his own life.\n\nHe wrote a \"Life of Augustus\" (\"Bios Kaisaros\"), which seems to have been completed after the death of the emperor in AD 14, when Nicolaus was 78. Two long chunks remain, the first concerning Octavius' youth, the second Caesar's assassination.\n\nHe also wrote an autobiography, the date of which is uncertain. It mentions that he wanted to retire, in 4 BC, but was persuaded to travel with Herod Archelaus to Rome.\n\nThe fragments that remain deal mainly with Jewish history.\n\nHe composed commentaries on Aristotle. A compendium of excerpts from these is extant in a Syriac manuscript discovered in Cambridge in 1901, (shelfmark Gg. 2. 14). This dates later than 1400, was acquired by Cambridge in 1632, and is very tatty and disarranged. The majority of the manuscript is a work by Dionysius Bar Salibi. The work was probably written in Rome ca. AD 1, when he attracted criticism for being too involved in philosophy to court the wealthy and powerful.\n\nPorphyrius in On the Faculties of the Soul mentions that Nicolaus of Damascus wrote a book On the Psyche, which stated that the division of the psyche-soul was not founded on quantity, but on quality, like the division of an art or a science. Clearly, by ‘parts’ of the psyche-soul, Nicolaus meant its different faculties.\n\nAn Arabic translation of his work \"De Plantis\", once attributed to Aristotle, was discovered in Istanbul in 1923. It also exists in a Syriac manuscript at Cambridge.\n\nHe composed some tragedies and comedies, which are now lost.\n\nOne of the most famous passages is his account of an embassy sent by an Indian king \"named Pandion (Pandyan kingdom) or, according to others, Porus\" to Augustus around AD 13. He met with the embassy at Antioch. The embassy was bearing a diplomatic letter in Greek, and one of its members was a \"sramana\" who burnt himself alive in Athens to demonstrate his faith. The event made a sensation and was quoted by Strabo and Dio Cassius. A tomb was made to the \"sramana\", still visible in the time of Plutarch, which bore the mention \"ΖΑΡΜΑΝΟΧΗΓΑΣ ΙΝΔΟΣ ΑΠΟ ΒΑΡΓΟΣΗΣ\" (Zarmanochēgas indos apo Bargosēs – Zarmanochegas, Indian from Bargosa):\n\nThis accounts suggests that it may not have been impossible to encounter an Indian religious man in the Levant during the time of Jesus.\n\nThe Jewish historian Josephus references the fourth book of Nicolaus' history concerning Abram (Abraham).\n\n\n"}

Based in Omaha, Nebraska, the Beef play their home games at Ralston Arena in nearby Ralston.\n\nOmaha originally played in the Indoor Professional Football League in 2000 and 2001 as an expansion team. The Beef made the playoffs their first and second seasons, advancing to the 2001 IPFL Championship. With the IPFL folding, the Beef moved to the National Indoor Football League (NIFL) on October 10, 2001. The Beef then joined the newly formed United Indoor Football (UIF) in 2005 as a charter member. In 2008, the UIF merged with the Intense Football League to create the Indoor Football League.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2011, the organization went through several general manager and head coaching changes. Despite those changes, the team finished in the top tier of the league. In 2009, James Kerwin was head coach of the Beef and led the team to a 12–2 record and to the second round of the IFL playoffs. The Beef continued their consecutive playoff qualification streak, which ended after 14 years across five leagues when the Beef failed to qualify for the playoffs in 2014.\n\nThe organization entered their thirteenth year of existence and fourth year as a member of the IFL in 2012. Despite constant changes within the league, of expansion and contraction, the Beef were a constant and competitive member. During the 2012 season, ownership of the team was then taken over by the league. The head coach was let go during season and several other changes were made to cut costs. Despite this, Andy Yost and James Kerwin took over as co-head coaches and the Beef qualified for the playoffs with some key wins. The IFL decided to not allow Omaha in the playoffs. This resulted in the ending of a 12-year playoff appearance streak.\n\nIn December 2012, the Omaha Beef was accepted by the CPIFL to begin play in March 2013. The Beef posted a 123–65 (.654) record up to this time.\n\nIn December 2012, the Omaha Beef were bought by Cornhusker Beef, Inc. On December 6, 2012, the Beef announced the new ownership group composing of Rich Tokhiem, Gerard Daly and Jim Tokhiem. \n\nIn their first season in the Champions Professional Indoor Football League (CPIFL), the Beef hired Andy Yost as head coach, who had finished the previous season as interim co-head coach. Yost led the Beef to a 10–2 record and qualified for the playoffs, as they finished second, in a three-way tie (Sioux City(1), Wichita(3)) in the league. The Beef fell to Wichita 31–25.\n\nAfter leading the team to the playoffs in 2013, Yost moved from head coach to quarterback coach for the 2014 season. The Beef hired Steve Heimann as head coach and he coached the Beef to a win in their 2014 exhibition game. However, he then resigned before coaching a regular season game. The Beef promoted defensive coordinator Dan Thurin to head coach. The Beef finished with a record of 4–8, which was an all-time franchise worst at that time.\n\nOn January 7, 2015, the Beef announced that former Cornhusker and NFL veteran Cory Ross would be the head coach for the 2015 season. Ross previously coached the Lincoln Haymakers of the CPIFL, also owned by Beef owner Rich Tokhiem, which ceased operations after the 2014 season.\n\nIn 2015 season, the Beef started playing in Champions Indoor Football (CIF), created by the merger of the CPIFL with the Lone Star Football League (LSFL).\n\nOmaha opened 2015 with their worst start in franchise history at 0–5. On April 1, defensive coordinator Demetrius Ross opined that the Beef's poor start was in part due to preparations beginning in January instead of October and that the coaches did not get to select the players that they wanted. The Beef finished the 2015 season with a record of 1–11, their worst record in franchise history. The Beef also finished in ninth place in the nine-team CIF, marking the first time the Beef ever finished last in a league. In their 11 losses, the Beef lost by an average of 25.0 points per game, were last in the league in points with given up at 672 (56.0/game), points scored at 395 (32.9/game), and a turnover differential of –16.\n\nIn 2016, the Omaha Beef took advantage of their schedule to improve their record to 7–5. Omaha played six of their 12 games against first year franchises (Chicago Eagles and Salina Liberty) in which the Beef recorded five of their seven wins. Omaha only had one win over a team with a winning record when they played (Wichita Force 4-1 on April 16) and only played three games all season against teams that came into the contest with a winning record. In the Beef’s seven wins, the opponent’s combined 2016 records were 29–54. Despite playoff expansion for the CIF in 2016, where half of all teams in the league qualified for the playoffs, the Beef failed to make the playoffs for the third year in a row, the longest playoff drought in franchise history. \n\nThe 2017 season saw the team return to the playoffs. The Beef took advantage of an again increased playoff field, where the top four of seven division teams qualified for the playoffs, a schedule with five of 12 games against first-year expansion teams and a division with three, first-year expansion teams, to qualify for the 2017 playoffs. Omaha was outscored by their opponents during the regular season and only played four games against teams with winning records at the time of the game, winning only one (Bloomington on March 18) and dropping three (Sioux City on March 31, Sioux City on May 27, and Dallas on June 3). Omaha's seven regular season wins came against teams with a combined 2017 record of 25–59. The Beef's wins during the 2016 and 2017 seasons came against teams with a combined 54–113 record. Omaha qualified as the North Division representative for the CIF Championship game. The South division saw six of the seven teams post winning regular season records as the Texas Revolution came out of the tougher division for the Champions Bowl III bid. Texas controlled most of the championship game, never trailing. The Revolution played conservatively in the fourth quarter, with a 30-point lead to defeat the Beef 59–49 and claim the league title.\n\nPrior to the 2018 season, and for the second time under this ownership, after qualifying for the playoffs, the head coach left the position before the following season. On August 16, 2017, head coach Cory Ross was announced as the head coach for the CIF expansion Quad City Steamwheelers. Victor Mann was named head coach, who had led the Texas Revolution to the league championship in 2017. Despite being a centerpiece in the Beef's off-season marketing campaign, days before the opening of the 2018 season, the Omaha Beef announced that Mike Bonner would be head coach for the upcoming season with Mann never coaching a game for the Beef. Four games into the 2018 season, though a public announcement was not made by the organization at the time, players confirmed that Mike Bonner was removed from the head coach position and Rod Miller, the assistant head coach and former Beef head coach, was appointed head coach before Omaha's fifth game of the season. Bonner was head coach for only four games, posting a 1–3 record, including losing the last three by a combined five points. Miller became the seventh person to hold the position over the previous six seasons. Midway through the season, Omaha suspended starting quarterback Anthony Iannotti. Iannotti led the Beef to the 2017 Champions Bowl, where he started 14 out of 15 games. Iannotti was later released. Omaha finished the season losing four out of the last five games and posting a 4–8 record, tied for second worst in franchise history with the 2014 season. The Beef failed to qualify for the playoffs for the fourth time in five seasons, the longest stretch in franchise history. \n\nThe Beef only qualified for the playoffs twice under this ownership group and posted a 33–39 (.458) regular season record. This is the only ownership group that has posted a non-winning record. \n\nDuring the 2018 offseason, the Beef were reported to be for sale. On October 24, 2018, the Beef announced the new owners as Ricky Bertz, a founder of the CIF, and Craig Tirey. On November 6, 2018, the Beef announced that James Kerwin would return as head coach for the 2019 season.\n\nOmaha has rivalries with the Sioux City Bandits (since the NIFL days) and the Sioux Falls Storm, which also moved from the NIFL to the IFL. Omaha's rivalry with Sioux City has become one-sided, as the Bandits have defeated the Beef in 14 of their last 17 meetings. A new rivalry developed when the IFL expanded to Grand Island, Nebraska, in 2011 as the Nebraska Danger creating the I-80 rivalry. However, Sioux Falls and Nebraska stayed in the IFL (Indoor Football League) when the Beef moved to the CPIFL before the 2013 season.\n\nThe following is a list of all Beef players who have won league Awards\n\nThe Beef organization have the only all-male dance team in indoor football, the Rump Roasters, along with an all-female dance team, the Prime dancers. The Prime dancers have won several awards including the best dance team three times in the UIF and 2009 dance team of the year in the IFL. They are ambassadors for the Beef organization as well and perform in conjunction with the Rumproasters. The Prime were named Dance team of the Year once again for 2012.\n\nThe mascot for the Beef is an Angus bull named Sir Loin. He won mascot of the year three times in UIF and was named 2009 Mascot of the year in the IFL. He was named Mascot of the Year for 2011 and again in 2012.\n\n"}

Once they were founded, the Sioux City Bandits assumed identity of the Attack. The organization has seen seven different leagues as the Attack played in the previously mentioned original IFL. The Bandits have played in the National Indoor Football League (NIFL), United Indoor Football (UIF), the new Indoor Football League (IFL), American Professional Football League (APFL), the Champions Professional Indoor Football League (CPIFL), and now Champions Indoor Football (CIF). Notable team feats include the signing of former Sioux City running back Fred Jackson by the Buffalo Bills of the NFL. Upon returning for NFL training camp, Jackson was selected to be just one of 8 on the team's practice squad. Jackson is currently listed on the Buffalo Bills 53 man roster. Jackson, out of Coe College, was the 2005 United Indoor Football's league leading rusher in which he set an Indoor Football record for most yards in a single season with more than 1,700.

{"id": "1958451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958451", "title": "Japanese phonology", "text": "Japanese phonology\n\nThe phonology of Japanese features about 15 consonant phonemes, the cross-linguistically typical five-vowel system of , and a relatively simple phonotactic distribution of phonemes allowing few consonant clusters. It is traditionally described as having a mora as the unit of timing, with each mora taking up about the same length of time, so that the disyllabic (\"Japan\") may be analyzed as and dissected into four moras, , , , and .\n\nStandard Japanese is a pitch-accent language, wherein the position or absence of a pitch drop may determine the meaning of a word: \"chopsticks\", \"bridge\", \"edge\" (see Japanese pitch accent).\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the following describes the standard variety of Japanese based on the Tokyo dialect.\n\nSee below for more in-detail descriptions of allophonic variation.\n\nNon-coronal voiced stops between vowels may be weakened to fricatives, especially in fast or casual speech:\n\nHowever, is further complicated by its variant realization as a velar nasal . Standard Japanese speakers can be categorized into 3 groups (A, B, C), which will be explained below. If a speaker pronounces a given word consistently with the allophone (i.e. a B-speaker), that speaker will never have as an allophone in that same word. If a speaker varies between and (i.e. an A-speaker) or is generally consistent in using (i.e. a C-speaker), then the velar fricative is always another possible allophone in fast speech.\n\n\n\nIn the middle of compound words morpheme-initially:\n\nSo, for some speakers the following two words are a minimal pair while for others they are homophonous:\n\n\nTo summarize using the example of \"hage\" 'baldness':\n\n\nSome phonologists posit a distinct phoneme , citing pairs such as 'big sheet of glass' vs. 'big raven'.\n\nThe palatals and palatalize the consonants preceding them:\n\nFor coronal consonants, the palatalization goes further so that alveolo-palatal consonants correspond with dental or alveolar consonants ( 'field' vs. 'tea'):\n\nOf the allophones of , the affricate is most common, especially at the beginning of utterances and after , while fricative may occur between vowels. Both sounds, however, are in free variation.\n\nIn the case of the , , and , when followed by , historically, the consonants were palatalized with merging into a single pronunciation. In modern Japanese, these are arguably separate phonemes, at least for the portion of the population that pronounces them distinctly in English borrowings.\n\nThe vowel also affects consonants that it follows:\n\nAlthough and occur before other vowels in loanwords (e.g. \"faito\" 'fight'; \"fyūjon\" 'fusion'; \"tsaitogaisuto\" 'Zeitgeist'; \"eritsin\" 'Yeltsin'), and are distinguished before vowels except (e.g. English \"fork\" vs. \"hawk\" > \"fōku\" vs. \"hōku\" ). is still not distinguished from (e.g. English \"hood\" vs. \"food\" > \"fūdo\" ). Similarly, and usually do not occur even in loanwords so that English \"cinema\" becomes \"shinema\" ; although they may be written and respectively, they are rarely found even among the most innovative speakers and do not occur phonemically.\n\nThe contrast between and is neutralized before and : . By convention, it is often assumed to be , though some analyze it as , the voiced counterpart to . The writing system preserves morphological distinctions, though spelling reform has eliminated historical distinctions except in cases where a mora is repeated once voiceless and once voiced, or where rendaku occurs in a compound word: , from . Some dialects retain the distinctions between and and between and , while others retain only and but not and , or merge all four (see Yotsugana).\n\nSome analyses of Japanese treat the moraic nasal as an archiphoneme ; other less abstract approaches take its uvular pronunciation as basic or treat it as coronal appearing in the syllable coda. In any case, it undergoes a variety of assimilatory processes. It is variously:\n\n\nStudies in the 2010s have shown, however, that there is considerable variability in the realization of word-final , and that , possibly with a double or secondary articulation, is much more common than .\n\nSome speakers produce before , pronouncing them as , while others produce a nasalized vowel before .\n\nThese assimilations occur beyond word boundaries.\n\nWhile Japanese features consonant gemination, there are some limitations in what can be geminated. Most saliently, voiced geminates are prohibited in native Japanese words. This can be seen with suffixation that would otherwise feature voiced geminates. For example, Japanese has a suffix, || that contains what calls a \"floating mora\" that triggers gemination in certain cases (e.g. || +|| > 'a lot of'). When this would otherwise lead to a geminated voiced obstruent, a moraic nasal appears instead as a sort of \"partial gemination\" (e.g. || + || > 'splashing').\n\nIn the late 20th century, voiced geminates began to appear in loanwords, though they are marked and have a high tendency to devoicing. A frequent example is loanwords from English such as \"bed\" and \"dog\" that, though they end with voiced singletons in English, are geminated (with an epenthetic vowel) when borrowed into Japanese. These geminates frequently undergo devoicing to become less marked, which gives rise to variability in voicing:\nThe distinction is not rigorous. For example, when voiced obstruent geminates appear with another voiced obstruent they can undergo optional devoicing (e.g. \"doreddo\" ~ \"doretto\" 'dreadlocks'). attributes this to a less reliable distinction between voiced and voiceless geminates compared to the same distinction in non-geminated consonants, noting that speakers may have difficulty distinguishing them due to the partial devoicing of voiced geminates and their resistance to the weakening process mentioned above, both of which can make them sound like voiceless geminates.\n\nThere is some dispute about how gemination fits with Japanese phonotactics. One analysis, particularly popular among Japanese scholars, posits a special \"mora phoneme\" ( \"Mōra onso\") , which corresponds to the sokuon . However, not all scholars agree that the use of this \"moraic obstruent\" is the best analysis. In those approaches that incorporate the moraic obstruent, it is said to completely assimilate to the following obstruent, resulting in a geminate (that is, double) consonant. The assimilated remains unreleased and thus the geminates are phonetically long consonants. does not occur before vowels or nasal consonants. This can be seen as an archiphoneme in that it has no underlying place or manner of articulation, and instead manifests as several phonetic realizations depending on context, for example:\n\nAnother analysis of Japanese dispenses with . In such an approach, the words above are phonemicized as shown below:\n\nGemination can of course also be transcribed with a length mark (e.g. ), but this notation obscures mora boundaries.\n\nVarious forms of sandhi exist; the Japanese term for sandhi generally is , while sandhi in Japanese specifically is called . Most commonly, a terminal on one morpheme results in or being added to the start of the next morpheme, as in , (ten + ō = tennō). In some cases, such as this example, the sound change is used in writing as well, and is considered the usual pronunciation. See (\"in Japanese\") for further examples.\n\n\nExcept for , the short vowels are similar to their Spanish counterparts.\n\nVowels have a phonemic length contrast (i.e. short vs. long). Compare contrasting pairs of words like \"ojisan\" 'uncle' vs. \"ojiisan\" 'grandfather', or \"tsuki\" 'moon' vs. \"tsūki\" 'airflow'.\n\nSome analyses make a distinction between a long vowel and a succession of two identical vowels, citing pairs such as \"satōya\" 'sugar shop' vs. \"satooya\" 'foster parent' . They are usually identical in normal speech, but when enunciated a distinction may be made with a pause or a glottal stop inserted between two identical vowels.\n\nWithin words and phrases, Japanese allows long sequences of phonetic vowels without intervening consonants, pronounced with hiatus, although the pitch accent and slight rhythm breaks help track the timing when the vowels are identical. Sequences of two vowels within a single word are extremely common, occurring at the end of many \"i\"-type adjectives, for example, and having three or more vowels in sequence within a word also occurs, as in \"aoi\" 'blue/green'. In phrases, sequences with multiple \"o\" sounds are most common, due to the direct object particle 'wo' (which comes after a word) being realized as \"o\" and the honorific prefix 'o', which can occur in sequence, and may follow a word itself terminating in an \"o\" sound; these may be dropped in rapid speech. A fairly common construction exhibiting these is \"... (w)o o-okuri-shimasu\" 'humbly send ...'. More extreme examples follow:\n\nIn many dialects, the close vowels and become voiceless when placed between two voiceless consonants or, unless accented, between a voiceless consonant and a pausa.\n\nGenerally, devoicing does not occur in a consecutive manner:\n\nThis devoicing is not restricted to only fast speech, though consecutive voicing may occur in fast speech.\n\nTo a lesser extent, may be devoiced with the further requirement that there be two or more adjacent moras containing the same phoneme:\n\nThe common sentence-ending copula \"desu\" and polite suffix \"masu\" are typically pronounced and .\n\nJapanese speakers are usually not even aware of the difference of the voiced and devoiced pair. On the other hand, gender roles play a part in prolonging the terminal vowel: it is regarded as effeminate to prolong, particularly the terminal as in \"arimasu\". Some nonstandard varieties of Japanese can be recognized by their hyper-devoicing, while in some Western dialects and some registers of formal speech, every vowel is voiced.\n\nJapanese vowels are slightly nasalized when adjacent to nasals . Before the moraic nasal , vowels are heavily nasalized:\n\nAt the beginning and end of utterances, Japanese vowels may be preceded and followed by a glottal stop , respectively. This is demonstrated below with the following words (as pronounced in isolation):\n\nWhen an utterance-final word is uttered with emphasis, this glottal stop is plainly audible, and is often indicated in the writing system with a small letter \"tsu\" called a sokuon. This is also found in interjections like and . These words are likely to be romanized as and .\n\nJapanese words have traditionally been analysed as composed of moras; a distinct concept from that of syllables. Each mora occupies one rhythmic unit, i.e. it is perceived to have the same time value. A mora may be \"regular\" consisting of just a vowel (V) or a consonant and a vowel (CV), or may be one of two \"special\" moras, and . A glide may precede the vowel in \"regular\" moras (CjV). Some analyses posit a third \"special\" mora, , the second part of a long vowel (a chroneme). In this table, the period represents a mora break, rather than the conventional syllable break.\n\nIn English, stressed syllables in a word are pronounced louder, longer, and with higher pitch, while unstressed syllables are relatively shorter in duration. Japanese is often considered a mora-timed language, as each mora tends to be of the same length, though not strictly: geminate consonants and moras with devoiced vowels may be shorter than other moras. Factors such as pitch have negligible influence on mora length.\n\nStandard Japanese has a distinctive pitch accent system: a word can have one of its moras bearing an accent or not. An accented mora is pronounced with a relatively high tone and is followed by a drop in pitch. The various Japanese dialects have different accent patterns, and some exhibit more complex tonic systems.\n\nAs an agglutinative language, Japanese has generally very regular pronunciation, with much simpler morphophonology than a fusional language would. Nevertheless, there are a number of prominent sound change phenomena, primarily in morpheme combination and in conjugation of verbs and adjectives. Phonemic changes are generally reflected in the spelling, while those that are not either indicate informal or dialectal speech which further simplify pronunciation.\n\nIn Japanese, sandhi is prominently exhibited in rendaku – consonant mutation of the initial consonant of a morpheme from unvoiced to voiced in some contexts when it occurs in the middle of a word. This phonetic difference is reflected in the spelling via the addition of dakuten, as in . In cases where this combines with the yotsugana mergers, notably and in standard Japanese, the resulting spelling is morphophonemic rather than purely phonemic.\n\nThe other common sandhi in Japanese is conversion of or (\"tsu, ku\"), and or (\"chi, ki\"), and rarely or (\"fu, hi\") as a trailing consonant to a geminate consonant when not word-final – orthographically, the sokuon , as this occurs most often with . So that \n\nSome long vowels derive from an earlier combination of a vowel and \"fu\" (see onbin). The \"f\" often causes gemination when it is joined with another word:\n\nMost words exhibiting this change are Sino-Japanese words deriving from Middle Chinese morphemes ending in , or , which were borrowed on their own into Japanese with a prop vowel after them (e.g. MC * > Japanese ) but in compounds as assimilated to the following consonant (e.g. MC * > Japanese ).\n\nSandhi also occurs much less often in , where, most commonly, a terminal or on one morpheme results in (or when derived from historical \"m\") or respectively being added to the start of a following morpheme beginning with a vowel or semivowel, as in . Examples:\n\n\nAnother prominent feature is , particularly historical sound changes.\n\nIn cases where this has occurred within a morpheme, the morpheme itself is still distinct but with a different sound, as in , which underwent two sound changes from earlier → (onbin) → (historical vowel change) → (long vowel, sound change not reflected in kana spelling).\n\nHowever, certain forms are still recognizable as irregular morphology, particularly forms that occur in basic verb conjugation, as well as some compound words.\n\nThe polite adjective forms (used before the polite copula and verb ) exhibit a one-step or two-step sound change. Firstly, these use the continuative form, , which exhibits \"onbin\", dropping the \"k\" as → . Secondly, the vowel may combine with the preceding vowel, according to historical sound changes; if the resulting new sound is palatalized, meaning , this combines with the preceding consonant, yielding a palatalized syllable.\n\nThis is most prominent in certain everyday terms that derive from an \"i\"-adjective ending in \"-ai\" changing to \"-ō\" (\"-ou\"), which is because these terms are abbreviations of polite phrases ending in \"gozaimasu\", sometimes with a polite \"o-\" prefix. The terms are also used in their full form, with notable examples being:\n\nOther transforms of this type are found in polite speech, such as → and → .\n\nThe morpheme (with \"rendaku\" ) has changed to or , respectively, in a number of compounds. This in turn often combined with a historical vowel change, resulting in a pronunciation rather different from that of the components, as in (see below). These include:\n\n\nIn some cases morphemes have effectively fused and will not be recognizable as being composed of two separate morphemes.\n\n\n\n"}

The Storm joined the original Indoor Football League as an expansion team in 1999 as the Sioux Falls Cobras, and first took the field for the 2000 season. They currently participate in another iteration of the Indoor Football League; prior to that, the Storm were in United Indoor Football (UIF), where they won all four of the league's championship games. In the newer IFL, the Storm have won seven of the eleven championships in the league as of 2019.\n\nThey play their home games at Denny Sanford Premier Center. In mid-April 2014, the team announced that the 2014 season would be its last at the aging Sioux Falls Arena (also known as the Storm Shelter), originally constructed in 1961. In 2015, the Storm followed the Sioux Falls Stampede of the United States Hockey League to the newly constructed Denny Sanford Premier Center.\n\nThe Storm were founded as an expansion team in the original Indoor Football League in 1999 as the Sioux Falls Cobras. In their inaugural 2000 season, they won their first game defeating the Sioux City Attack 44–30. They went 8–6 on the season and finished fourth in the Southern Division. After one season, the became members of the National Indoor Football League (NIFL) and changed their name to the Storm. The Storm hosted the 2004 NIFL championship game against the Lexington Horsemen in the Storm Shelter in front of a sellout crowd. The Horsemen won the championship game, but the Storm defeated the Horsemen a year later in the second round of the 2005 UIF playoffs in Lexington.\n\nThe Sioux Falls Storm were charter members of United Indoor Football (UIF) in 2005 and were the first UIF champions with a win over the Sioux City Bandits, 40–38 at Sioux City. Sioux Falls won its second consecutive UIF championship in 2006 at their home ground, the Arena, defeating the Lexington Horseman 72–64 on July 29, 2006. Quarterback Terrance Bryant was named United Bowl II MVP after throwing eight touchdowns in the match. Defensive end Nate Fluit recorded 16.5 sacks in 2005 and 15.5 in 2006.\n\nSioux Falls became one of the few teams in indoor football history to post a shutout, beating the Peoria Rough Riders 71–0 on June 3, 2006.\n\nOn Saturday, August 4, 2007, the Storm defeated the Lexington Horsemen for the second United Bowl in a row, 62 to 59. With 19 seconds left to go in the game Storm quarterback Terrance Bryant threw up a prayer, and though protested by the small crowd of Horsemen fans, it was ruled a touchdown pass. With three seconds left in the game, and with the help of a frantic fan going for the game ball, the Horsemen gained 15 yards for a chance to kick a field goal and tie the game, but the kick was missed by Horsemen kicker Collin Barber.\n\nOn March 29, 2008, the Storm lost to the Omaha Beef 34–18, ending their historic 40-game winning streak and giving them their first loss since July 15, 2005. They went on to win their fourth United Bowl later that season against the Bloomington Extreme.\n\nOn April 25, 2009, after switching to the Indoor Football League, the Storm were found in violation of the IFL's rule of not complying with regulations related to workers compensation coverage. As punishment, the team's first five wins of the 2009 season were forfeited; this resulted in a 6-8 season, the first losing season in team history. The other three losses all came to the Billings Outlaws. In 2010, the Storm rebounded to reach the United Bowl before losing 43-34 to the Outlaws.\n\nAfter a tornado dubbed the Father's Day Tornado hit Billings' Rimrock Auto Arena on June 20, 2010, causing major damage, the Outlaws franchise folded, and their star quarterback Chris Dixon signed with the Storm. Led by Dixon, Sioux Falls scored an astounding 1022 points on the 2011 regular season, with 70 or more points in 10 games and opening with a 105-71 win over the Kent Predators in Kent, Washington. Only twice did the Storm fall short of 50 points and both were against the Omaha Beef, who handed them a 41-37 loss in the regular season finale after Sioux Falls had started 13-0. The two teams met in the next game, which was the playoff opener. The Storm won it, 52-39, then beat Green Bay 52-12 to return to the United Bowl. Although they tied their lowest scoring game of the season, Sioux Falls rolled over the Tri-Cities Fever 37-10 to earn the league championship after a two-year hiatus and also win its first IFL title. Dixon and the Storm dominated again in 2012, this time with a perfect 14-0 record and 941 points in the regular season. On April 14, the Storm beat the Allen Wranglers, then featuring former NFL standout receiver Terrell Owens, 52-45 on the road in Allen, Texas. Dixon threw his 500th career touchdown pass, when he hit James Terry with a 42-yard pass during a May 19 game against the Blizzard. Sioux Falls defeated the Lehigh Valley Steelhawks 79-21 in the playoff opener, then again beat Green Bay in the semifinal and Tri-Cities (this time winning 59-32) in the United Bowl.\n\nDixon then left, attempting to make it with the Orlando Predators of the Arena Football League. Sioux Falls did not suffer greatly in 2013 as Storm legend Terrance Bryant returned to play quarterback. Following a 10-4 season, the Storm again prevailed in the playoffs and defeated the Nebraska Danger by a close 43-40 score for the title. Bryant then retired again, as on January 6, 2014, it was announced that Dixon would be returning to the Storm, citing his desire to graduate from Augustana College and be close to his family. Dixon did not disappoint, leading the Storm to their eighth title in 2014. The Storm again defeated Nebraska in the United Bowl by a 63-46 score. The Sioux Falls Storm completed its era at the Sioux Falls Arena with a 112-14 home record including 82-3 from 2006–2014.\n\nIn 2015, the Storm's first season at the Denny Sanford Premier Center was very successful, completing another undefeated season at 16-0 overall, and was capped off with winning their ninth league championship by a score of 62–27 over the Danger.\n\nIn 2016, the Storm continued their dominance. But lost their first game since the 2014 season as they lost at the Cedar Rapids Titans, 60–57. But despite that setback, they capped off another successful season with a win over the newly minted Spokane Empire, 55–34, to capture their tenth championship overall and their sixth IFL Championship and sixth in a row. They returned to the championship game in 2017, but lost for the first time since the 2010 season to the Arizona Rattlers.\n\nPrior to the 2018 season, the Storm announced they would join Champions Indoor Football (CIF) on August 30, 2017, in order to have smaller travel budget and reignite rivalries with the nearby Sioux City Bandits and Omaha Beef.

Citing poor attendance and lowered revenue, a fate not unusual for UIF teams.\n\nHowever, on October 16, 2007, House opted to remain in operations by announcing he changed his mind and the Horsemen would be playing the 2008 season in arenafootball2, where they would have an in-state rivalry (\"The War on I-64\") with the Louisville Fire. With the move the Horsemen adopted new jerseys, that included a slight change in their blue color scheme.\n\nThe Horsemen saw numerous changes occur aft the 2008 season. Most notably, ownership changed hands from the House family to the newly formed not for profit Horsemen Charitable Foundation. The foundation was spearheaded by former Horsemen general manager Brian Boehm in an effort to keep Central Kentucky from losing yet another professional sports team.\n\nJust when they were about to play in the new Arena Football League in 2010, the team shut down operations due to financial situations. However, on the team's official website, a newly designed logo is shown with \"Don't count us out yet!\" underneath, possibly hinting at the team making a comeback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Tasker was Surveyor General of the Eastern Shore from October 1747 to 1755.\n\nBenjamin Tasker Jr. was appointed by Provincial Governor of Maryland, Horatio Sharpe as Commissioner, to secure the assistance of The Six Nations, having been voted £500 by the Maryland General Assembly for this purpose. This commission resulted in the Confederacy of 1752, a union of colonial interests for defense about a quarter of a century before the United States Declaration of Independence.\n\nHe was one of Maryland's delegates to the Albany Congress of 1754, another attempt on the part of the colonists to deal jointly with a common problem. He served on a committee at the Albany congress with Benjamin Franklin which was charged with the task of drawing up a plan for a central government of all the colonies. Ath the adjournment of the congress, the plan adopted was submitted to the various legislatures for approval. While it was rejected, its goals were pursued later at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia.\n\nIn 1752 he helped to organize a lottery to pay for a town clock in Annapolis.\n\nHe was dispatched to settle Cresap's War between Maryland and Pennsylvania.\n\nTasker partnered with his brother-in-law, Christopher Lowndes on the slaving voyage of the \"Elijah\".\n\nAn owner of thoroughbred horses, Tasker is noted in horse racing circles for having imported from England the mare \"Selima\" between 1750 and 1752. Sired by Godolphin Arabian, \"Selima\" was raced until the end of the 1752 season then was sent to Samuel Ogle's Belair Stud in Collington, Maryland. As a broodmare, \"Selima\" produced ten foals that would become an important bloodline in American racing with important racing offspring such as \"Hanover\" and is even the ancestress of George Washington's stallion, \"Magnolia.\" \nTasker and Franklin became friends, and when Franklin visited Annapolis in the spring of 1755, he visited Tasker at the Belair Mansion, then being run by Tasker.

{"id": "1958460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958460", "title": "Vasily Arkhipov (vice admiral)", "text": "Vasily Arkhipov (vice admiral)\n\nVasili Alexandrovich Arkhipov (, 30 January 1926 – 19 August 1998) was a Soviet Navy officer credited with preventing a Soviet nuclear strike (and, presumably, all-out nuclear war) during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Such an attack likely would have caused a major global thermonuclear response. \n\nAs flotilla commander and second-in-command of the diesel powered submarine , Arkhipov refused to authorize the captain's use of nuclear torpedoes against the United States Navy, a decision requiring the agreement of all three senior officers aboard. \n\nIn 2002, Thomas Blanton, who was then director of the US National Security Archive, said that Arkhipov \"saved the world\".\n\nArkhipov was born into a peasant family in the town of Staraya Kupavna, near Moscow. He was educated in the and participated in the Soviet–Japanese War in August 1945, serving aboard a minesweeper. He transferred to the Caspian Higher Naval School and graduated in 1947.\n\nAfter graduating in 1947, Arkhipov served in the submarine service aboard boats in the Black Sea, Northern and Baltic Fleets.\n\nIn July 1961, Arkhipov was appointed deputy commander and therefore executive officer of the new ballistic missile submarine \"K-19\". After a few days of conducting exercises off the south-east coast of Greenland, the submarine developed an extreme leak in its reactor coolant system. This leak led to failure of the cooling system. Radio communications were also affected, and the crew was unable to make contact with Moscow. With no backup systems, Commander Zateyev ordered the seven members of the engineer crew to come up with a solution to avoid nuclear meltdown. This required the men to work in high radiation levels for extended periods. They eventually came up with a secondary coolant system and were able to keep the reactor from a meltdown. Although they were able to save themselves from a nuclear meltdown, the entire crew, including Arkhipov, were irradiated. All members of the engineer crew and their divisional officer died within a month due to the high levels of radiation they were exposed to. Over the course of two years, fifteen more sailors died from the after-effects.\n\nOn 27 October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, a group of eleven United States Navy destroyers and the aircraft carrier located the diesel-powered, nuclear-armed near Cuba. Despite being in international waters, the Americans started dropping signaling depth charges, explosives intended to force the submarine to come to the surface for identification. There had been no contact from Moscow for a number of days and, although the submarine's crew had earlier been picking up U.S. civilian radio broadcasts, once \"B-59\" began attempting to hide from its U.S. Navy pursuers, it was too deep to monitor any radio traffic. Those on board did not know whether war had broken out or not. The captain of the submarine, Valentin Grigorievitch Savitsky, decided that a war might already have started and wanted to launch a nuclear torpedo.\n\nUnlike the other subs in the flotilla, three officers on board \"B-59\" had to agree unanimously to authorize a nuclear launch: Captain Savitsky, the political officer Ivan Semonovich Maslennikov, and the flotilla commodore (and executive officer of B-59) Arkhipov. Typically, Russian submarines armed with the \"Special Weapon\" only required the captain to get authorization from the political officer to launch a nuclear torpedo, but due to Arkhipov's position as Commodore, \"B-59\"s captain also was required to gain Arkhipov's approval. An argument broke out, with only Arkhipov against the launch.\n\nEven though Arkhipov was second-in-command of the submarine \"B-59\", he was in fact Commodore of the entire submarine flotilla, including \"B-4\", \"B-36\" and \"B-130\". According to author Edward Wilson, the reputation Arkhipov had gained from his courageous conduct in the previous year's \"K-19\" incident also helped him prevail. Arkhipov eventually persuaded Savitsky to surface and await orders from Moscow. This effectively averted the general nuclear war which probably would have ensued if the nuclear weapon had been fired. The submarine's batteries had run very low and the air-conditioning had failed, causing extreme heat and high levels of carbon dioxide inside the submarine. They were forced to surface amid the American pursuers and return to the Soviet Union as a result.\n\nImmediately upon return to Russia, many crew members were faced with disgrace from their superiors. One admiral told them \"It would have been better if you'd gone down with your ship.\" Olga, Arkhipov's wife, even said \"he didn't like talking about it, he felt they hadn't appreciated what they had gone through.\" Each captain was required to present a report of events during the mission to the Soviet defense minister, Andrei Grechko. Grechko was infuriated with the crew's failure to follow the strict orders of secrecy after finding out they had been discovered by the Americans. One officer even noted Grechko's reaction, stating that he \"upon learning that it was the diesel submarines that went to Cuba, removed his glasses and hit them against the table in fury, breaking them into small pieces and abruptly leaving the room after that.\"\n\nIn 2002, retired Commander Vadim Pavlovich Orlov, a participant in the events, held a press conference revealing the subs were armed with nuclear torpedoes and that Arkhipov was the reason those devices had not been fired. Orlov presented the events less dramatically, saying that Captain Savitsky lost his temper, but eventually calmed down.\n\nWhen discussing the Cuban Missile Crisis in 2002, Robert McNamara, the U.S. Secretary of Defense at the time, stated, \"We came very close\" to nuclear war, \"closer than we knew at the time.\" Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., an advisor for the John F. Kennedy administration and a historian, continued this thought by stating \"This was not only the most dangerous moment of the Cold War. It was the most dangerous moment in human history.\"\n\nArkhipov continued in Soviet Navy service, commanding submarines and later submarine squadrons. He was promoted to rear admiral in 1975, and became head of the Kirov Naval Academy. Arkhipov was promoted to vice admiral in 1981 and retired in the mid-1980s.\n\nHe subsequently settled in Kupavna (which was incorporated into Zheleznodorozhny, Moscow Oblast, in 2004), where he died on 19 August 1998. The radiation to which Arkhipov had been exposed in 1961 may have contributed to his kidney cancer, like many others who served with him in the \"K-19\" accident.\n\nNikolai Vladimirovich Zateyev, the commander of the submarine \"K-19\" at the time of its onboard nuclear accident, died nine days later, on 28 August 1998. Both Arkhipov and Zateyev were 72 at the time of their deaths.\n\nVasili Arkhipov was married to Olga Arkhipova until his death in 1998. They had a daughter named Yelena.\n\nArkhipov was known to be a shy and humble man. In a PBS documentary titled \"The Man Who Saved the World\", his wife described him as intelligent, polite and very calm. Much of what is known about his personality comes from her. According to her, he enjoyed searching for newspapers during their vacations and tried to stay up-to-date with the modern world as much as possible. In this same interview, Olga alludes to her husband's possible superstitious beliefs as well. She recalls walking in on Vasili burning a bundle of their love letters inside their house, claiming that keeping the letters would mean \"bad luck\".\n\nThe \"K-19\" accident was the basis for the 2002 film, \"\".\n\nThe 4th track on the 2017 album \"The Dusk in Us\" by mathcore band Converge is titled \"Arkhipov Calm\" and is based on his Cuban missile crisis decision.\n\nIn recognition of his actions onboard B-59, Arkhipov received the first \"Future of Life Award,\" which was presented posthumously to his family in 2017. Offered by the Future of Life Institute, this award recognizes exceptional measures, often performed despite personal risk and without obvious reward, to safeguard the collective future of humanity.\n\n\n"}

Additional varieties include Mr. Chew Big, Mr. Big Fudge, and Mr. Big with Maple.\n\nThe bar is common in Canada, but is also available in Hungary, Poland and some areas of the United States. A Canadian advertising campaign in the 1970s included the tagline \"Mr. Big: so big they call him Mister\". The product launched in the U.S. in 1995, and the launch included an advertising campaign with the basketball player Shaquille O'Neal.

For example, tests are often created by a team of psychometricians and a team of SMEs. The psychometricians understand how to engineer a test while the SMEs understand the actual content of the exam. Books, manuals, and technical documentation are developed by technical writers and instructional designers in conjunctions with SMEs. Technical communicators interview SMEs to extract information and convert it into a form suitable for the audience. SMEs are often required to sign off on the documents or training developed, checking it for technical accuracy. SMEs are also necessary for the development of training materials.\n\nIn pharmaceutical and biotechnology areas, ASTM standard E2500 specifies SMEs for various functions in project and process management. In one project, there will be many SMEs who are experts on air, water, utilities, process machines, process, packaging, storage, distribution and supply chain management, to name a few.\n\"Subject Matter Experts are defined as those individuals with specific expertise and responsibility in a particular area or field (for example, quality unit, engineering, automation, development, operations). Subject Matter Experts should take the lead role in the verification of manufacturing systems as appropriate within their area of expertise and responsibility.\" —ASTM E2500 §6.7.1 and §6.7.2.\nIn engineering and technical fields, an SME is the one who is an authority in the design concept, calculations and performance of a system or process.\n\nIn the scientific and academic fields subject matter experts are recruited to perform peer reviews, and are used as oversight personnel to review reports in the accounting and financial fields.\n\nA lawyer in an administrative agency may be designated an SME if he or she specializes in a particular field of law, such as tort, intellectual property rights, etc. A law firm may seek out and use an SME as an expert witness.\n\nIn electronic discovery environments, the term \"SME\" labels professionals with expertise using computer-assisted reviewing technology (CAR) and Technology Assisted Review (TAR) to perform searches designed to produce precisely refined results that identify groups of data as potentially responsive or non-responsive to relevant issues. E-discovery SMEs also typically have experience in constructing the search strings used in the search. It also refers to experts used to \"train\" the TAR systems.\n\nA domain expert is frequently used in expert systems software development, and there the term always refers to the domain other than the software domain. A domain expert is a person with special knowledge or skills in a particular area of endeavour (e.g. an accountant is an expert in the domain of accountancy). The development of accounting software requires knowledge in two different domains: accounting and software. Some of the development workers may be experts in one domain and not the other.\n\nIn software engineering environments, the term is used to describe professionals with expertise in the field of application. The term \"SME\" also has a broader definition in engineering and high tech as one who has the greatest expertise in a technical topic. SMEs are often asked to review, improve, and approve technical work; to guide others; and to teach. According to Six Sigma an SME \"exhibits the highest level of expertise in performing a specialized job, task, or skill of broad definition.\"\n\nIn software development, as in the development of \"complex computer systems\" (e.g., artificial intelligence, expert systems, control, simulation, or business software) an SME is a person who is knowledgeable about the domain being represented (but often not knowledgeable about the programming technology used to represent it in the system). The SME tells the software developers what needs to be done by the computer system, and how the SME intends to use it. The SME may interact directly with the system, possibly through a simplified interface, or may codify domain knowledge for use by knowledge engineers or ontologists. An SME is also involved in validating the resulting system. SME has formal meaning in certain contexts such as Capability Maturity Models.\n\n\n"}

These wheels, also called pinwheels, could be set by using a side lever which could expose anywhere from 0 to 9 teeth, and therefore when coupled to a counter they could, at each rotation, add a number from 0 to 9 to the result. By linking these wheels with carry mechanisms a new kind of calculator engine was invented. Turn the wheels one way and one performs an addition, the other way a subtraction. As part of a redesign of the arithmometer, they reduced by an order of magnitude the cost and the size of a mechanical calculators on which one could easily do the four basic operations (add, subtract, multiply and divide).\n\nPinwheel calculators became extremely popular with the success of the Odhner Arithmometer.\n\n\n\"The operation of machines of this type was accomplished by means of pulling levers or knobs to set up the desired number. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division were accomplished by means of revolving drums. For addition they revolved in one direction, and for subtraction the direction was reversed. For multiplication the revolutions were repeated in the same direction as for addition, and for division they were repeated in the same direction as for subtraction. Two sets of dials provided a means of reading totals.

{"id": "1958468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1958468", "title": "Karen R. Hitchcock", "text": "Karen R. Hitchcock\n\nKaren R. Hitchcock (February 10, 1943 – July 10, 2019) was an American biologist and university administrator who had leadership positions at an American and a Canadian university. She served as the President of SUNY's University at Albany in Albany, New York, from 1996 until her resignation in 2003. She was Principal and Vice-Chancellor of Queen's University, in Kingston, Ontario from 2004 until an abrupt resignation in 2008, when she announced her departure in a sudden email to students. After her sudden departure from Queen's University, she returned, with husband Murray Blair, to the Albany, New York, area to live in Vischer Ferry.\n\nHitchcock was born in 1943 in Williston Park, New York, a suburb of New York City on Long Island, the daughter of Roy Clinton Hitchcock and Ruth Wardell Hitchcock. She attended Mineola High School and went to prom with Robert A. Bauman, Ed.D.\n\nHitchcock received a B.S. degree in Biology from St. Lawrence University in 1964, and a Ph.D. degree in Anatomy from the University of Rochester in 1969. As a Postdoctoral Fellow, she did work in pulmonary cell biology at The Webb-Waring Institute for Medical Research at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.\n\nHitchcock continued her career at Boston's Tufts University, serving as the George A. Bates Professor of Histology and Chair of the Department of Anatomy and Cellular Biology in the Schools of Medicine, Dental Medicine, Veterinary Medicine and the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences over a course of 15 years. At Tufts, Hitchcock met and, after his divorce, married Murray Blair, her dean at the School of Medicine. From there she moved to the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center and then to the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\nIn her early academic career, Hitchcock published in the field of cell and developmental biology. She received the National Science Foundation Professorship for Women in Science and Engineering (1983–84).\n\nHitchcock joined the University at Albany, part of the State University of New York system, in 1991 as Vice President for Academic Affairs. During that time, she brought to fruition the formation of the university's College of Arts and Sciences; oversaw the university's sesquicentennial celebration; implemented a substantial revision of the campus's General Education Program; developed an enrollment management plan across all academic units; created a \"Presidential Scholars\" program at the undergraduate level and founded the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning.\n\nIn 1995, she was named interim President and assumed the Presidency in 1996, Albany's 16th President and the first woman to hold that position in the history of the university.\n\nUnder her leadership from 1996 to 2003, the university expanded the possibilities of its educational mission among networks associated with its growing cadre of regional, state, national, and global partners. Recruitment and retention of students added to Albany's reputation as hosting an increasingly diverse student body, while also enhancing its high academic profile. Successful educational initiatives such as \"Project Renaissance\" added to the university's reputation and attracted steadily increasing numbers of applicants to its undergraduate programs; at the same time, Hitchcock's spearheading of programs in nano-technology and health-related programs expanded not only the university's reputation for excellence, but also its literal footprint.\n\nDuring the early years of her presidency, Empire Commons was built, Division I athletic programs implemented, and the New York Giants made UAlbany their summer training camp for over ten years. On campus, a new Life Sciences Building and an Art/Sculpture facility improved opportunities for merging research with classroom instruction across a variety of disciplines. Finally, the university's \"East Campus\" in Rensselaer - now known as the Health Sciences Campus - in conjunction with the state's support for a Center of Excellence in Cancer Genomics and the addition of a campus devoted to the School of Public Health and health-related research and academic programs, led to substantive advancements in biotechnology and biomedical sciences.\n\nIn October 2003, the Albany Times Union reported that tensions between Hitchcock and the SUNY Chancellor had crested, leaving her future with the University uncertain. Hitchcock abruptly resigned from her post, citing recent bids for presidencies at the University of Florida and University of Tennessee. Media speculation around those failed candidacies centered on the SUNY Chancellor's wresting of the highly touted Sematech North from Hitchcock's control.\n\nOn February 25, 2005, the New York Times reported that Hitchcock faced a state ethics inquiry about allegations that she had offered to deliver a multimillion-dollar non-competitive student housing construction contract to a hand-selected developer. In exchange, the developer had supposedly agreed to provide Hitchcock with an endowed professorship which she would hold exclusively once she was forced out of the presidency. This alleged scheme came about because Hitchcock had reportedly been informed by the then-Chancellor of the SUNY system, Robert King, of her pending termination as President. The endowed chair reportedly would have made up the difference between her salary as president and the salary of a biology professor. The ethics allegations were referred to the New York State Ethics Commission by King, with the support of the SUNY Board of Trustees. But before the Commission could convene their inquiry, the investigation became known to Hitchcock, and she abruptly resigned from SUNY Albany, allegedly to escape liability since the New York Ethics Commission would be unable to take action against someone who is not a state employee. Safely out of reach of the Ethics Commission, Hitchcock, through her lawyer, claimed to have approached George Pataki, then the Governor of the State of New York, asking for the case to be reopened and investigated in order to \"clear her name\"; the Ethics Commission, in fact, had no authority to investigate her after her resignation. Queen's University had hired lawyers to ensure the university was not defamed, and the Queen's search committee claimed they had been satisfied with Hitchcock's version of the story.\n\nWhile at SUNY Albany, Hitchcock had also co-hosted a weekly radio show called \"The Best of Our Knowledge\" on an independent local public radio station (WAMC) founded and run by one of Hitchcock's faculty members at SUNY Albany, Alan S. Chartock. This program was paid for by the SUNY Albany Foundation, using gifts intended for the students and faculty of the university, until Dr. Hitchcock's abrupt departure from that campus. For some time afterward, her participation in the program was paid for by Queen's University. Chartock, a vocal political opponent of then-Governor George Pataki, delivered a number of print and broadcast defenses of Hitchcock, in which Chartock failed to mention his financial reliance on her patronage.\n\nHitchcock became the Principal of Queen's University in July, 2004. Queen's University is one of Canada's most prominent universities, according to several national and international rankings, such as \"Maclean's\" magazine, \"The Globe and Mail\", and \"The Times\" Higher Educational Supplement (THES), and Hitchcock was notable both as an American import and as that institution's first female Principal.\n\nAt the beginning of her term as Principal, Hitchcock pushed for a major and controversial new infrastructure project, the Queen's Centre. It was to be the largest project undertaken by a Canadian university to that time, encompassing expanded and upgraded sports facilities, a student life centre and a new academic building. The project had a budget of $230 million, and was scheduled to take nearly a decade to complete. Groundbreaking took place two and a half years later, in February, 2007. Within fourteen months, the massive project would be 20% over budget.\n\nSoon after Hitchcock arrived at Queen's University, she began taking extended leaves of absence, ostensibly to tend to her husband, Murray Blair, who by that time required the use of a wheelchair. Despite campus disgruntlement with her absences, Hitchcock applied for a second five-year term as Queen's principal in January, 2008.\n\nHitchcock came under increasing fire for her lack of leadership and high degree of invisibility in the Queen's community. She was also criticized by donors, alumni, faculty and community leaders for the growing financial crisis surrounding the lavish Queen's Centre project, which was already some $38 million (nearly 20%) over budget only 14 months after it began its 10-year construction.\n\nOn March 4, 2008, two months after Hitchcock applied for reappointment, the Assembly of the AMS, the Queen's University undergraduate student government, unanimously passed a motion stating their opposition to her reappointment, forwarding this recommendation to the Queen's University committee studying the matter.\n\nHitchcock's initial five-year term was slated to end on June 30, 2009. On April 16, 2008, only four months after seeking reappointment and a month after the unanimous rejection by students, Hitchcock suddenly withdrew her request for reappointment in an email to faculty, staff, and students and announced her resignation, to become effective two weeks later, on April 30, 2008, fourteen months before the scheduled end of her term.\n\nIn October, 2008, Hitchcock briefly rejoined Queen's University as an unpaid fellow in the university's School of Policy Studies, Centre for the Study of Democracy, which is headed by Thomas Axworthy, before retiring to a farm at Vischer Ferry, New York, north of Albany.\n\nHitchcock's husband, Murray Blair, subsequently died in February, 2010. She died after a long illness on July 10, 2019, at age 76.\n\n"}

The \"women\" of the title were in fact heroines, many of whom lay with gods, bearing the heroes of Greek mythology to both divine and mortal paramours. In contrast with the focus upon narrative in the Homeric \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\", the \"Catalogue\" was structured around a vast system of genealogies stemming from these unions and, in M. L. West's appraisal, covered \"the whole of the heroic age.\" Through the course of the poem's five books, these family trees were embellished with stories involving many of their members, and so the poem amounted to a compendium of heroic mythology in much the same way that the Hesiodic \"Theogony\" presents a systematic account of the Greek pantheon built upon divine genealogies.\n\nMost scholars do not currently believe that the \"Catalogue\" should be considered the work of Hesiod, but questions about the poem's authenticity have not lessened its interest for the study of literary, social and historical topics. As a Hesiodic work that treats in depth the Homeric world of the heroes, the \"Catalogue\" offers a transition between the divine sphere of the \"Theogony\" and the terrestrial focus of the \"Works and Days\" by virtue of its subjects' status as demigods. Given the poem's concentration upon heroines in addition to heroes, it provides evidence for the roles and perceptions of women in Greek literature and society during the period of its composition and popularity. Greek aristocratic communities, the ruling elite, traced their lineages back to the heroes of epic poetry; thus the \"Catalogue\", a veritable \"map of the Hellenic world in genealogical terms,\" preserves much information about a complex system of kinship associations and hierarchies that continued to have political importance long after the Archaic period. Many of the myths in the \"Catalogue\" are otherwise unattested, either entirely so or in the form narrated therein, and held a special fascination for poets and scholars from the late Archaic period through the Hellenistic and Roman eras.\n\nDespite its popularity among the Hellenistic literati and reading public of Roman Egypt, the poem went out of circulation before it could pass into a medieval manuscript tradition and is preserved today by papyrus fragments and quotations in ancient authors. Still, the \"Catalogue\" is much better attested than most \"lost\" works, with some 1,300 whole or partial lines surviving: \"between a third and a quarter of the original poem\", by one estimate. The evidence for the poem's reconstruction—not only elements of its content, but the distribution of that content within the \"Catalogue\"—is indeed extensive, but the fragmentary nature of this evidence leaves many unresolved complexities and has over the course of the past century led to several scholarly missteps.\n\nAncient authors most commonly referred to the poem as the \"Catalogue of Women\", or simply the \"Catalogue\", but several alternate titles were also employed. The tenth-century encyclopedia known as the \"Suda\" gives an expanded version, the \"Catalogue of Heroic Women\" (), and another late source, the twelfth-century Byzantine poet and grammarian Tzetzes, prefers to call the poem the \"Heroic Genealogy\" (). But the earliest and most popular alternate title was \"Ehoiai\" (), after the feminine formula \"ē' hoiē\" (, ), \"or such as\", which introduces new sections within the poem via the introduction of a heroine or heroines. This nickname also provided the standard title for a similar Hesiodic work, the \"Megalai Ehoiai\" or \"Great Ehoiai\" ().\n\nAs is reflected by its use as an alternate title, the \"ē' hoiē\"-formula was one of the poem's most recognizable features. It may have belonged originally to a genre of poetry that simply listed notable heroines, but in the \"Catalogue\" the formula is used as a structuring tool that allows the poet to resume a broken branch of a family tree, or to jump horizontally across genealogies to a new figure and line of descent. A characteristic example is found in the introduction of the daughters of Porthaon at \"Cat\". 26.5–9:\nThe preceding section of the poem had dealt at some length with the extended family of Porthaon's sister Demodice, tracing her line down to the generation following the Trojan War. Here \"ē' hoiai\" (plural) is used to jump backwards in order to complete the account of the descendants of Porthaon and Demodice's father Agenor by covering the son's family. Elsewhere the formula is used in transitions to more distant branches. The Ehoie of Mestra, for example, ultimately serves to reintroduce the family of Sisyphus, Mestra's great-granduncle who hoped to win her as bride for his son Glaucus. Although that marriage does not take place, the descendants of Sisyphus are soon presented.\n\nAccording to the \"Suda\", the \"Catalogue\" was five books long. The length of each is unknown, but it is likely that the entire poem consisted of anywhere from 4000 to over 5000 lines. The majority of the content was structured around major genealogical units: the descendants of Aeolus were found in book 1 and at least part of book 2, followed by those of Inachus, Pelasgus, Atlas and Pelops in the later books. It is believed that a rough guide to this structure can be found in the \"Bibliotheca\", a Roman-era mythological handbook transmitted under the name of Apollodorus of Athens which used the \"Catalogue\" as a primary source for many genealogical details and appears to have followed the poem's overall arrangement.\n\nThe first is by far the best-attested book of the poem, with several extensive papyri overlapping ancient quotations or coinciding with paraphrases: at least 420 verses of dactylic hexameter survive in part or entire. One papyrus includes line numbers which, taken together with the system of overlaps among the other sources, allows much of the book's content to be assigned approximate line numbers. Perhaps the most significant of these overlaps is between the papyrus containing the opening lines of the poem and the \"Theogony\": the \"Catalogue\" was styled as a continuation of the \"canonical\" Hesiodic poem, with the final two verses of the \"Theogony\" standing as \"Catalogue of Women\" book 1, lines 1–2. Toward the end of the \"Theogony\" as transmitted by the manuscript tradition, following Zeus's final ordering of Olympus and his siring several key deities, the poet invokes the Muses to sing of the \"tribe of goddesses ... immortals who slept with mortal men, bearing children like gods.\" After some 150 verses on this topic, the proem to the \"Catalogue\" comes in the form of another re-invocation of the Muses to introduce a new, only slightly more terrestrial topic (\"Cat\". fr. 1.1–5):\n\nThe immediately subsequent lines describe significant characteristics of the heroic age. The first allowed for the liaisons that are the poem's ostensible subject: gods and mortals freely interacted in those days. A further significant detail about the heroic condition is offered next in one of the most puzzling passages of the \"Catalogue\". Men and women are said to have been not \"equally long-lived\" (, \"isaiōnes\", a \"hapax legomenon\"), but it is unclear whether this refers to different lifespans among the heroes themselves, a difference between the lives of the heroes and \"today's\" man, or between the lifespans of the heroes and the gods. The differing fates of the heroes are then described: some appear to have lived a long life characterized by perpetual youth, while others were apparently condemned to an early death by the gods. The papyrus is damaged at this point, and the full implications of these comparisons are unknown. The Muses are next addressed again, asked to sing of \"however many [Zeus] lay with, siring the race of glorious kings ... and Poseidon [lay with] ... Ares ... Hermes ... [Heph]aestus ... Heracles\"; here the papyrus ends.\n\nThe repeated use of the introductory phrase \"or such as ...\" implies an initial \"such as ...\", and it is likely that this first woman treated was Pyrrha, wife of Deucalion. There is some debate about whether the \"Catalogue\" included an account of the Flood myth, but the creation of a race of humans born from stones cast by Deucalion and Pyrrha does appear to have figured in the poem. Zeus unsurprisingly had first pick from the catalogue of women, and sired Hellen by Pyrrha. Pyrrha also had three daughters by Deucalion: Thyia, Protogeneia and Pandora, who was named for her maternal grandmother, the famous Pandora. Like their mother, these three lay with Zeus, bearing sons from whom several early Greek tribes were said to descend. Thyia bore Magnes and Macedon; Protogeneia bore Aethlius, the grandfather of Aetolus; and Pandora's son was Graecus.\n\nBut it was the family of Hellen, who would himself ultimately be the eponym for the entire Greek world, that had the greatest mythological significance. He sired Dorus, Xuthus and Aeolus, apparently by Othryis, the nymph of Mount Othrys. Dorus was the eponym of the Dorians, and his son Aegimius' sons, Dymas and Pamphylus, gave their names to two of the three Dorian tribes, the Dymanes and Pamphyli. The third division was called the Hylleis, after Heracles' son Hyllus, with whom Pamphylus and Dymas migrated to the Peloponnese. Xuthus married Erechtheus' daughter Creusa and was the father of Ion and Achaeus, along with a daughter named Diomede. The relation between the progenitors of Greek tribes among the descendants of Deucalion is outlined in the following table:\n\nWhat was likely the largest unified stemma to be treated, the account of the descendants of Aeolus and Aenarete's five daughters and seven sons, stretched from before the 200th line of book 1 well into the second book. The sons who were certainly found in the \"Catalogue\" are Cretheus, Athamas, Sisyphus, Salmoneus, Deion (or Deioneus) and Perieres. A seventh son's name is obscured in lacuna: he has been identified tentatively as Minyas, Locrus or a second Magnes, not the eponym of the Magnetes, but the father of Dictys and Polydectes of the Danaë-Perseus myth. No similar doubt attends the identities of Aeolus' daughters: they were Peisidice, Alcyone, Calyce, Canace and Perimede. The families of the daughters were treated first, and much of the middle of book 1—over 400 lines—was devoted to recounting their descendants. Aeolus' extended family, via both sons and daughters, is notable for a concentration of fantastical narratives and folk elements of a sort largely absent from the Homeric poems, beginning with the doomed, hubristic love of Ceyx and Alcyone, who called one another \"Zeus\" and \"Hera\" and were turned into the kingfisher and halcyon as punishment (frr. 10a.83–98, 10d OCT, 15).\n\nAfter treating the Thessalian families of Peisidice and Canace, the poet turned to the intermingled Aetolian-Elian lines of Calyce and Perimede. Perimede had earlier in the book borne two sons to the river Achelous, one of whom was the grandfather of Oeneus, Hippodamas. To Aethlius Calyce bore Endymion, whose son Aetolus was the eponym of Aetolia and the great-grandfather of Demodice and Porthaon, through whom the later Aetolian and Elian genealogies were traced. Somewhere within these families, Eurytus and Cteatus were found in a form more fearsome than they were in the \"Iliad\": in the \"Catalogue\" they were fierce conjoined twins with two heads, four arms and an equal number of legs. Most significant for the epic tradition, however, was the marriage of Demodice's son Thestius and Porthaon's daughter Eurythemiste which produced the daughters Leda, Althaea and Hypermestra, who are introduced in a group Ehoiai at fr. 23a.3–5.\nLeda's marriage to Tyndareus is followed by the births of Clytemnestra, Timandra and Phylonoe, the last of whom Artemis made immortal. Clytemnestra and Agamemnon had two daughters, Electra and Iphimede, the name used in the poem for the woman later and more famously known as Iphigenia. It had been prophesied that she must be sacrificed to Artemis before the Greek fleet could sail for Troy, but in the \"Catalogue\" version of events the goddess replaced her with an \"eidolon\" and immortalized Iphimede as \"Artemis Enodia\", or Hecate. Next Orestes' birth and matricide are reported, the earliest extant account of his killing Clytemnestra, as the planned sacrifice of Iphimede/Iphigenia is first found in the \"Catalogue\". Timandra's marriage to Echemus follows, followed in turn by Leda's bearing the Dioscuri to Zeus in several damaged lines. It is unknown if Helen's birth was reported here, for the testimonia leave her parentage uncertain. Althaea lies with Ares and bears Meleager, whose heroic qualities are described along with his death at the hands of Apollo during the conflict with the Curetes that was the sequel to the Hunt for the Calydonian Boar. Among Althaea's children by Oeneus, Deianeira is singled out for her role in the death and apotheosis of Heracles. The poet next turns his attention to the Porthaonids (see above) and closes out his account of the female Aeolids with the Sirens, daughters of Sterope and Achelous.\n\nThe Ehoie of Salmoneus' daughter Tyro provides the transition to the families of the male Aeolids. As king of Elis, Salmoneus forced his subjects to worship him as Zeus and simulated the god's thunder and lightning by dragging bronze cauldrons from his chariot and throwing torches through the air. The real Zeus destroyed king and subjects alike, but spared Tyro and conducted her to the house of her uncle Cretheus in Thessaly because she wrangled with her impious father. There she became enamored of the river Enipeus, but Poseidon had his own designs upon Tyro and in the guise of the river lay with her, siring Neleus and Pelias. The brothers did not get along, and Zeus gave them different realms to rule: Pelias received as his lot Iolcos; to Neleus fell Pylos in the western Peloponnese. The house of Neleus now takes center-stage. Heracles sacked Pylos, killing all the male Neleids, save Nestor who was off in Gerenia, another Messenian city. Periclymenus, a son of Neleus to whom Poseidon had granted the ability to change shape, was Pylos' only bulwark against the onslaught of Heracles, and the \"Catalogue\"-poet granted him a brief \"aristeia\" which ended when Athena pointed out that the bee on Heracles' chariot was actually the Pylian defender. Following the account of Nestor's marriage and family, the contest for Neleus' daughter Pero was narrated. The father would give her hand to whoever could rustle the cattle of Iphicles from Phylace, a feat accomplished by Bias with the help of his brother Melampus. The poet then turned to the family of Pelias as the last assignable papyrus fragment from book 1 breaks off. It is likely that Tyro's children by Cretheus—Aeson, Pheres and Amythaon—followed, and there might have been room in the book to at least start the family of Cretheus' brother Athamas.\n\nAthamas ruled in Boeotia and had a complicated family life, several details of which are known to have played part in the \"Catalogue\". His first children were Phrixus and Helle, whose mother was Nephele. In what was the first episode of the Argonautic saga, she gave her children a ram with a golden fleece upon which they fled the intrigues of their stepmother Ino according to other sources. Athamas was driven mad by the gods, perhaps because he took the young Dionysus into his household, and slaughtered his and Ino's son Learchus; Ino herself jumped into the sea with their son Melicertes and became the sea-goddess Leucothea. At some point before his marriage to Ino, Athamas had sired Leucon and Schoeneus by Themisto, and Leucon's daughters Peisidice, Euippe and Hyperippe were given extended group treatment in the \"Catalogue\".\n\nIt is uncertain at what point among the extant fragments the division between books 1 and 2 fell, but at least some of the Aeolid families were covered in the second book. The families of Perieres, Deion and Sisyphus (in that order) were most likely found in the 2nd book because there does not appear to be enough room left in book 1 to accommodate them as a group after the children of Neleus and Pelias. It was once thought that the Ehoie of Atalanta opened the book, but recently published evidence casts doubt upon this view (see Book 3, below).\n\nPerieres' family was centered around Messene. His son Leucippus had several daughters, but Arsinoe was singled out for extensive treatment. To Apollo she bore Asclepius, whom Zeus killed. In a rage Apollo killed the Cyclopes, after which Zeus was about to hurl him into Tartarus when Leto interceded and arranged for Apollo to serve as a laborer for Admetus instead. Directly following the Asclepius affair comes the Ehoie of Asterodeia, the daughter of Deion. She bore Crisus and Panopeus to Phocus; the brothers did not get along, quarreling while still in the womb. Another daughter of Deion, Philonis, bore Philammon to Apollo and Autolycus to Hermes. Philammon sired Thamyris; Autolycus, the grandfather of Odysseus, was a master thief who could change the appearance of his booty to avoid detection. Autolycus' daughter Polymele, the mother of Jason, is apparently born directly preceding the Ehoie of Mestra, the daughter of Erysichthon.\nMestra's story is one of the best preserved and most studied sections of the \"Catalogue\". She had the ability to change her shape at will, a skill which her father Erysichthon exploited in service of a ravening hunger with which he had been cursed and for which reason the people had nicknamed him Aethon (, \"Aithon\", \"Blazing\"). He would marry off Mestra for the bride prices she garnered, only to have the girl return home in some different form. The most notable victim of this plot was Sisyphus, who, despite his characteristic cunning, could never retain custody of his would-be daughter-in-law. Strife arose between Sisyphus and Erysichthon which no mortal could resolve, and the case was handed over to another authority. The text is damaged at this point, and identity of the mediator is a matter of dispute, as is the nature of the verdict rendered. Exactly how this judgement resolves the quarrel over Mestra is obscure, but Sisyphus ultimately comes out on the losing end, for Mestra does not bear children to Glaucus. Instead Poseidon whisks her off to Kos, where she bears Eurypylus to the god. Eurypylus' descendants rule the island, which is sacked by Heracles in a brief allusion to the great hero's adventures. On his way home from attacking Troy for the horses of Laomedon, he assaulted Kos before going on to participate in the gigantomachy.\n\nThe Ehoie of Mestra closes with her returning to Athens to care for her father, but the poet's attention stays with Sisyphus, as he and his son are the male subjects of the Ehoie of Eurynome which immediately follows. She was wise and beautiful, having been taught womanly arts by Athena. Sisyphus attempted to cheat her of her cattle, but Zeus intervened. Although he did not get what he was after, Sisyphus did accomplish with Eurynome what he could not with Mestra: a marriage for Glaucus. The gods again got in the way, though, and she bore Bellerophontes to Poseidon, who gave his son the winged horse Pegasus with which Bellerophontes slew the Chimera. In the \"Iliad\" this task was presented as the order of Proetus' father-in-law Iobates, and in the \"Catalogue\" it appears to be followed immediately by the marriage of Bellerophontes and a daughter of the Lycian king.\n\nIn the \"Bibliotheca\" the descendants of Inachus followed Deucalion's, and the \"Catalogue\" appears to have followed the same order, likely introducing the Inachids via the Ehoie of Niobe, the river god's granddaughter. To Zeus she bore Argus, the eponym of Argos, who in turn sired Peiren, the father of Io. Zeus's affair with Io had a place in the \"Catalogue\", for ancient authors cite the poem's version of this myth when quoting an \"aition\" for the fact that \"all's far in love ...\", at least:\n\nZeus and Io's \"clandestine deeds\" produced a son, Epaphus, who was the father of Libya. The families of her two sons Agenor and Belus were covered in depth: the former's line in book 3, the latter's following his birth. Belus had a daughter, Thronia, who bore Arabus (the eponym of Arabia) to Hermes; Belus' sons were Aegyptus and Danaus.\n\nThe myth of the mass-wedding of Aegyptus' fifty sons and Danaus' fifty daughters came at this point, but little survives of the narrative in the \"Catalogue\". Danaus and his daughters fled to Argos and introduced the practice of digging wells, \"making waterless Argos well-watered Argos\" (). Aegyptus' sons followed the Danaids to Greece in order to compel them to marry, and, as in the predominant version of the myth, Hypermestra alone consummated her union with Lynceus and bore Abas, whose sons were Acrisius and Proetus. The daughters of Proetus offended Hera or Dionysus or both in some way, and were cursed with leprosy or madness which could only be cured by Melampous, a service which Abas rewarded by granting the seer and his brother Bias shares of Argos to rule. Acrisius' daughter was Danaë. Her golden liaison with Zeus, the birth of Perseus, and mother and son's involuntary exile in the larnax are quickly recounted, and Perseus' siring of Alcaeus, Sthenelus and Electryon by Andromeda also comes in quick succession.\n\nThe division between books 2 and 3 presents a special problem for the reconstruction of the \"Catalogue\". A scholion to Theocritus, \"Idyll\" 3.40 appears to attribute the story of Atalanta to \"Hesiod in book 3\", a method of citation that almost certainly refers to the present poem. One papyrus concludes with what appears to be the beginning of the first line of Atalanta's Ehoie followed by a forked paragraphos and blank space, suggesting that it is a \"reclamans\"; another papyrus (\"pictured\") clearly transmits the ends of the first few lines of her section preceded by blank space, giving the possibility that it was the beginning of a book. These two fragments would combine to give:\n\nThe account that follows is one of the most extensive and exciting episodes of the \"Catalogue\" to survive from antiquity. Atalanta wished to avoid marriage, but a throng of suitors gathered because of her beauty. Her father Schoeneus promised her hand to the one who could beat his swift daughter in a footrace, with one further condition: any who accepted the challenge and lost would be put to death. Aphrodite had given one of the contestants, Hippomenes, three golden apples with which to temp the girl off course; these he threw as he ran and begged Atalanta to have pity upon him. The toss of the third apple finally accomplished its aim, but the couple did not live happily after: through the will of Zeus Atalanta was transformed into lion because she had seen \"what it is not lawful to see,\" which presumably means that she had unlawfully entered a holy precinct. This is where the evidence for Atalanta leaves off, and it remains unknown just where and how the passage fit in the \"Catalogue\".\nIt is possible that the attribution to book three was simply incorrect, and Atalante's Ehoie came within the family of Athamas in books one or two. Another possibility is that she was introduced in the context of her mother's family. Her identity in the \"Catalogue\" is unknown, but this hypothesis could allow for Atalanta to appear within the Inachid stemma, following the Danae-Ehoie within the extended family of Belus.\n\nIn the \"Catalogue\" and later mythographic tradition, the family of Belus' brother Agenor was something \"like a repository for aliens and displaced persons.\" His son Phoenix was the eponym of Phoenicia, and if Cepheus and Cadmus were also his sons, the Agenorids would have been present in Aethiopia and Thebes as well. By one Alphesiboea Phoenix sired Adonis. Cassiepeia bore to him Phineus; she was perhaps also the mother of Phoenix's daughter Europa, but the girl's mother might have been Telephaassa, as in Moschus' \"Europa\".\nEuropa's tale, well known in later classical literature and beyond, appears in a largely familiar form in the \"Catalogue\". She caught Zeus's eye while she and some friends were gathering flowers in a meadow. The god transformed into a bull with breath smelling of saffron, in the guise of which he abducted Europa, carrying her upon his back to Crete. There she bore Minos, Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon to Zeus, and he gave her a necklace made by Hephaestus that would figure in Theban saga as the Necklace of Harmonia. Sarpedon ruled Lycia, and was apparently granted a lifespan equal to three generations of men by Zeus. His death at Troy and the rain of blood it inspired Zeus to send is briefly described. Minos ruled Crete, succeeding his stepfather Asterion. Poseidon sent up from the sea a bull which had sex with Minos' wife Pasiphae, siring the Minotaur. To Minos she also bore Deucalion, Catreus, Androgeos and Eurygyes, though it is equally possible that these last two names referred to a single son. At least one daughter, Ariadne, was surely present, for the myth of Androgeos–Eurygyes' death in Athens and the subsequent sacrifice of Athenian youths to the Minotaur will presuppose Theseus' expedition to Crete and Ariadne's complicity in slaying the beast.\n\nPhineus was even better-traveled than his sister Europa, and his biography in the \"Catalogue\" was apparently a \"\"pièce de résistance\"\" meant to conclude the geographically diverse Inachid stemma with an appropriate flourish. He ruled in Thrace, but was kidnapped by the Harpies. Zetes and Calais, the Boreads, pursued the tormentors and tormented to the ends of the earth. The poet catalogued many far-flung and remarkable races encountered during the chase, including: the Katoudaioi (\"Subterranean Men\"), Pygmies, Melanes (\"Black Men\"), Aethiopians, Libyans, \"horse-milking\" Scythians, Hemikynes (\"Half-Dogs\") and the Makrokephaloi, as well as griffins. Ephorus called the episode the \"Gês Períodos\" (, \"Journey Around the World\"), and it was once thought that this title referred to an independent work, one erroneously attributed to Hesiod. This view was disproved conclusively in 1911 with the publication of an extensive papyrus fragment (\"pictured\") of the episode which derived from the same bookroll that contained the myth of Europa described above.\n\nIt is likely that the section describing the Arcadian descendants of Pelasgus and Arcas followed that of the Inachids. Pelasgus was autochthonous; he sired Lycaon either by the Oceanid Meliboea or by Cyllene, the oread of an Arcadian mountain which still bears her name. Lycaon's fifty impious sons drew the ire of Zeus and were all destroyed, save Nyctimus. The majority of the subsequently covered Arcadian figures descend from Arcas, who was the son of Zeus and Callisto, a local nymph. A familiar version of her catasterism is attributed to \"Hesiod\" by Pseudo-Eratosthenes, but the Hesiodic work intended in this citation might have been the \"Astronomia\". Arcas had at least two sons: Elatus and Apheidas. Elatus sired Aepytus, the father of Tlesenor and Peirithous; Apheidas was the father of Stheneboea, the wife of Proetus, and Aleus. Aleus' daughter Auge was for some reason entrusted to the care of Teuthras in Mysia, where she lay with Heracles and bore Telephus. Telephus was on the Mysian throne when the Greek expedition to Troy accidentally landed there and found themselves fighting fellow \"Achaeans.\"\n\nIn the \"Bibliotheca\", the Arcadian genealogies are immediately followed by the Atlantids, and this progression is known to mirror the structure of the \"Catalogue\" because other fragments of the papyrus roll that transmits the Telephus myth cover families of Atlas' daughters: Taygete, Electra, Alcyone, Sterope, Celaeno, Maia and Merope. Maia bore Hermes to Zeus on Mount Cyllene. Taygete also slept with Zeus, becoming the mother of Lacedaemon, through whom much of the Spartan line was traced, including Tyndareos, the father of Helen, and Penelope, the wife of Odysseus. To Zeus yet again Electra bore Dardanus, the progenitor of the Trojan line, and Eetion, who was killed for sleeping with Demeter. Dardanus' sons were Erichthonius and Ilus. Hyrieus and Hyperes were Poseidon's children by Alcyone. Her section included the Ehoie of Hyrieus' daughter Antiope, who bore Amphion and Zethus to Zeus. Hyperes' daughter Arethusa slept with Poseidon and was changed to a spring in Euboea, but not before bearing Abas, the eponym of the Abantes. His line is traced down to Elephenor, leader of the Abantes in the Trojan War. Sterope lay with Ares and bore Oenomaus, but it is possible that this union was delayed to book four as part of the section treating the family of Pelops and Oenomaus' daughter Hippodameia.\n\nBefore the papyri began to accrue, the longest extant passage of the \"Catalogue\" was known from the \"Shield of Heracles\", the first 56 lines of which were borrowed from book 4 according to an ancient hypothesis to the \"Shield\". This passage, the Ehoie of Alcmene, recounts how she went to Thebes with her husband Amphitryon, who could not consummate the marriage until he had avenged the deaths of her brothers at the hands of the Taphians and Teleboans. As Amphitryon returned having accomplished this feat, Zeus lay with Alcmene; upon his return that very night, so too did Amphitryon. To the god Alcmene bore Heracles and to the hero she bore Iphicles.\n\nAlcmene belongs to the Pelopid line—her mother Lysidice was a daughter of Pelops and Hippodameia—, and the passages preceding her Ehoie also concern Pelopids. Three of Pelops' daughters married sons of Perseus: Lysidice married Electryon, Nicippe wed Sthenelus, and Astydameia wed Alcaeus. Nicippe and Sthenelus' daughter Astymedusa married Oedipus, and at the funeral games in his honor his son Polynices caught the eye of his future wife Argeia, the daughter of Adrastus. Pelops' son Atreus was the father of Pleisthenes who, contrary to the better known genealogy, was the father of Agamemnon and Menelaus. Their mother was Aerope, the daughter of Catreus, and their births were reported in the verses directly preceding the Ehoie of Alcmene.\n\nBesides the Pelopid line, and whatever remained of the Atlantid stemmata among which it ultimately belongs, little is known for certain about the further content of book 4. It is possible that an Athenian section including the various autochthonous kings of Athens and the daughters of Cecrops was found here. A family springing from the river Asopus has also been proposed for this region based on the presence of \"several persons or families that other sources represent as descended from daughters of Asopos.\" The most notable family that would belong to this section is that of Asopus' daughter Aegina, the nymph of the island that bears her name who slept with Zeus and bore Aeacus. Fearing that Aeacus would be lonely on his island, Zeus changed all of Aegina's ants into men, spawning the tribe of Myrmidons, a play upon their name and the Greek word for \"ant\", , \"mýrmēx\". This is the family to which Achilles belongs, the most notable hero in the Trojan saga, as well as his father Peleus and uncles Telamon and Menoetius.\n\nThe final book was different in that it apparently left behind the genealogical structure of the first four books. Book five opened with a nearly 200-line catalogue of the suitors of Helen, similar in style to the Catalogue of Ships in \"Iliad\" book 2. Although it is likely that the entire catalogue included twenty-five to thirty suitors, only twelve are attested by name. From Argos Amphilochus and Alcmaeon, the sons of Amphiaraus, attempted to win Helen, but were perhaps never able to join in the contest because of their punishment for the matricide of Eriphyle. Ever shrewd, Odysseus did not give gifts but simply sent envoys to Castor and Polydeuces, because he knew that Menelaus would ultimately prevail. Thoas was not so wise and gave many sheep and cows in the hope of winning Helen. From Phylace, many gifts were given by Podarces and Protesilaus, who were cousins in the \"Catalogue\", not brothers as in the Catalogue of Ships. Athenian Menestheus gave many gold cauldrons and tripods, confident that he was the wealthiest of all the heroes. Ajax wooed Helen from Salamis, promising to pillage the surrounding lands and give their possession as part of his gift. Idomeneus made the long journey from Crete himself, aware of Helen's beauty only from secondhand accounts.\n\nBefore giving his decision, Tyndareus bound all the suitors to his fateful oath: should anyone ever take his daughter by force, all those who had wooed her must exact vengeance upon her abductor. To this all the suitors readily agreed, each believing that he would be given Helen's hand. At this point the Catalogue of Suitors has come to a close, but even as Menelaus' success is reported, the poet introduces Achilles because of his status as the greatest hero of the Trojan saga and his central role in Zeus's plan to bring the Heroic Age to a close. With the aid of Agamemnon, Menelaus had given the most bride prices, but were Achilles already of age, he would surely have won Helen's hand, \"for neither warlike Menelaus nor any other human on earth would have defeated him\". But Achilles was not present, and Menelaus won Helen, who bore Hermione to him.\n\nThe marriage of Helen and Menelaus precipitates the Trojan War, the event that ultimately brings the heroic age to an end, but the circumstances surrounding this transition in the \"Catalogue\" are unclear. Directly following the birth of Hermione strife arises among the gods, and Zeus hatches a plan to stir up trouble among mankind. The exact meaning of this plan is obscure because of deficiencies in the text, and several interpretations have been proposed, the most commonly accepted being that Zeus plans to destroy a great number of men by causing the war, ultimately removing the heroes to a life lived in conditions resembling the Golden Age. Another possibility is that Zeus intends to destroy the race of heroes and return the world to its former order, when gods slept with each other, not mortals. In any event, a great change is coming, and as the final placed fragment of the \"Catalogue\" breaks off, several enigmatic scenes are sketched. A great storm arises which dwindles the strength of mankind:\n\nThese lines, described by West as \"the finest passage of poetry yet known from the \"Catalogue\"\", might parallel Calchas' prophecy in \"Iliad\" 2, which presages the first nine fruitless years of the Trojan War via the image of a snake devouring nine sparrows. Here the \"hairless one,\" a kenning for a snake, gives birth to what appears to be the first of three sets of triplets, and as the remains of the papyrus become more meager, the snake sloughs its skin, representing the regeneration that will come once the heroic age comes to an end and the world is given over to mortals.\n\nMany fragments that are securely attributed to the \"Catalogue\", some of which are relatively substantial, cannot be placed within the poem because their content is either too obscure or could be assigned to different individuals or genealogies which are themselves difficult to locate within the five books.\n\nThe place of Cyrene within the poem has implications beyond the level of content, for if her narrative is to be connected to the city of Cyrene in Libya, the \"terminus post quem\" for the composition of the \"Catalogue\" would be 631 BC, the approximate year of that city's foundation. Pindar, \"Pythian\" 9 tells how Apollo saw Cyrene hunting in her native Thessaly and was immediately enamored of the tomboy. The god goes to the cave of the wise centaur Chiron and asks who she is and whether it would be wise to consort with her. Chiron then prophesies that it is fated for Cyrene and Apollo to mate, and that he will bring her across the sea to Libya, where she will be queen of a portion of the land and bear to him a son, Aristaeus. A scholium on the ode states that \"Pindar took the story from an Ehoie of Hesiod's\" () and relates the opening lines of the section (\"Cat\". fr. 215):\n\nRichard Janko, who believes that the \"Catalogue\" was composed c. 690, argues that the extent to which Pindar relied upon the Hesiodic text is unknown and that, even if Apollo did carry Cyrene to Libya, this does not presuppose an aetiology of the city. Others have argued that the citation is also vague regarding just which Hesiodic poem included the Cyrene-Ehoie, the \"Catalogue\" or the \"Megalai Ehoiai\": the latter might have included a narrative similar to Pindar's, with the former presenting a different version of the myth, if indeed the \"Catalogue\" treated Cyrene at all. The complete removal of Cyrene would not, however, be easily accommodated by related evidence—it would presumably also involve transferring two fragments concerning Aristaeus which have traditionally been attributed to the \"Catalogue\", and his son Actaeon certainly appeared in the poem.\n\nThe myth of Actaeon is known to have been narrated in the \"Catalogue\" by virtue of a paraphrase found in a fragmentary dictionary of metamorphoses. According to the dictionary, the \"Catalogue\" included a variant of the myth in which Actaeon was changed into a stag by Artemis and then killed by his own hounds because he attempted to take Semele as his wife, thus angering Zeus, who had designs upon the woman. Before this testimonium appeared, another papyrus containing 21 hexameters related to the Actaeon myth was published by Edgar Lobel, who tentatively attributed the text to the \"Catalogue\". As the fragment opens, Actaeon has already been torn apart by his dogs, and a goddess—Athena or, less likely, Artemis—arrives at Chiron's cave. She prophesies to the centaur that Dionysus will be born to Semele and that Actaeon's dogs will roam the hills with him until his apotheosis, after which they will return to stay with Chiron. At this point the papyrus is damaged, but it is clear that the dogs are delivered from a \"madness\" (, \"lussa\", line 15) and begin to mourn their master as the goddess returns to Olympus. Merkelbach and West did not include this papyrus in their edition of the fragment, the latter calling it an \"incoherent epic pastiche\" which would cause the author of the \"Catalogue\" to \"turn in his grave if he knew that it had been attributed to him.\" According to Glenn Most, some scholars believe that the text is Hellenistic, but it is demonstrably archaic, and at least a few classicists today consider it to be part of the \"Catalogue\".\n\nDuring antiquity the \"Catalogue\" was almost universally considered the work of Hesiod. Pausanias reports, however, that the Boeotians living around Mount Helicon during his day believed that the only genuine Hesiodic poem was the \"Works and Days\" and that even the first 10 lines of that poem (the so-called \"hymn to Zeus\") were spurious. The only other surviving expression of doubt is found in Aelian, who cites \"Hesiod\" for the number of Niobe's children, but qualifies his citation with \"unless these verses are not by Hesiod, but have been passed off falsely as his, like many other passages.\" But Aelian's skepticism could have stemmed from the belief, still common today, that Hesiodic poetry was especially susceptible to interpolation, and it is impossible to tell whether he regarded the entire \"Catalogue\" as spurious or not. These two passages are, in any event, isolated, and more discerning critics like Apollonius of Rhodes, Aristophanes of Byzantium and Crates of Mallus apparently found no reason to doubt the attribution to Hesiod, going so far as to cite the \"Catalogue\" in arguments concerning the content and authenticity of other Hesiodic poems.\nModern scholars have not shared the confidence of their Hellenistic counterparts, and today the \"Catalogue\" is generally considered to be a post-Hesiodic composition. Since Hesiod is supposed to have lived around the turn of the seventh century BCE, the Cyrene-Ehoie alone could guarantee that the poem was not his.\nRichard Janko's survey of epic language, on the other hand, suggests that the \"Catalogue\" is very early, nearly contemporary with Hesiod's \"Theogony\", and Janko sees no reason why the \"Catalogue\" \"should not be by the same poet as the \"Theogony\",\" who \"calls himself Hesiod.\" But a different critical strain, one which views the transmitted Homeric and Hesiodic poems as ultimate products of rhapsodic recomposition within an oral tradition, would hold that from an initial Hesiodic nucleus the \"Catalogue\" arrived at its final form well after period to which Hesiod has been assigned. Such a scenario could account for perceived anachronisms in the mythological content and in the linguistic character of the poem, but would sidestep the issue of the relation between the \"Catalogue\" as it has been transmitted and the broader corpus of early Greek epic.\n\nM. L. West argues on poetic, linguistic, cultural and political grounds that an Athenian poet \"compiled the \"Catalogue of Women\" and attached it to Hesiod's \"Theogony\", as if it were all Hesiodic,\" sometime between 580 and 520 BCE, and thinks it possible that this range might be narrowed to the period following 540. He sees, for example, the marriage of Xuthus to a daughter of Erechtheus as a means of subordinating all of Ionia to Athens, since their union produced the eponym Ion. Similarly, Sicyon is made a son of Erechtheus (fr. 224), which West takes as a reflection of the tyrant Cleisthenes of Sicyon's attempts to promote Ionian–Athenian interests in the polis, which had traditionally been more closely connected to Dorian Argos. These and other considerations would, in West's view, establish a \"terminus post quem\" of , but he prefers a later dating on the assumption that \"Theogony\" 965–1020, which he assigns to the latter portion of the sixth century BCE, was contemporaneous with the composition of the \"Catalogue\".\n\nWest's arguments have been highly influential, but other scholars have arrived at different conclusions using the same evidence. Fowler thinks that the Sicyon genealogy would more likely reflect a composition before Cleisthenes' death (c. 575 BCE) and dates the poem to the period closely following the First Sacred War (595–585 BCE), connecting its content to the growing influence of the Amphictyonic League and placing its author in Aeolian Thessaly because of the Aeolid family-trees centered around that region which dominate the earlier portions of the poem. Hirschberger, on the other hand, takes this focus upon the Aeolids and the \"Catalogue\" poet's perceived interest in eastern peoples to be indicative of a poet from Aeolis in Asia Minor; she proposes that the \"Catalogue\" was composed there between 630 and 590 BCE, viewing the composition of the \"Shield of Heracles\" and an apparent allusion to the poem by Stesichorus (died c. 555 BCE) as providing the ultimate \"terminus ante quem\".\n\nThe \"Catalogue\"s greatest influence was felt during the Hellenistic period, when the poem was used as an extra-Homeric touchstone for the poets of the era who favored recondite and antiquarian references over direct engagement with the more prominent members of the canon. The most famous Hellenistic allusion to the \"Catalogue\" is found in Hermesianax's \"Leontion\", which included a catalogue of great literary figures and their loves, beginning with Orpheus and Agriope (more commonly known as Eurydice) and proceeding down to the poet's contemporaries, including his teacher Philitas of Cos. Many of the entries engage playfully with their subjects' work: Homer, for example, is portrayed as pining for Penelope. Directly preceding that lovestruck bard comes Hesiod's blurb:\n\nHere the \"ē' hoiē\"-formula is styled as the name of a woman, cleverly rendered \"Anne Other\" by Helen Asquith, and the grumpy Hesiod who reviled his home in Ascra at \"Works and Days\" 639–40 becomes a discomfited lover-boy in the village. Phanocles, a near contemporary of Hermesianax, composed an elegiac catalogue of mythological pederastic relationships entitled the \"Loves\" or \"Beautiful Boys\" in which each story was introduced by the formula \"ē' hōs\" (), \"or like\". Nicaenetus of Samos, a later Hellenistic poet, wrote his own \"Catalogue of Women\" and the otherwise unknown Sosicrates (or Sostratus) of Phanagoria was said to have written an \"Ehoioi\" (), the masculine equivalent of \"\"Ehoiai\"\". While allusions to the ehoie-formula and catalogue structure of the poem are most easily recognized, interaction with the \"Catalogue\" in Hellenistic poetry was not limited to plays upon these aspects: direct engagement with the myths found in the \"Catalogue\" were a popular way for the Alexandrians to show their Hesiodic affiliations.\n\nAt Rome the poets of the Late Republic and Augustan age continued the Hellenistic period's allusive engagement with the \"Catalogue\". Catullus, a poet who made plain his Callimachean affiliations, is the earliest Roman author who can be seen to engage with the \"Catalogue\". In his epyllion on the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, Catullus alludes to the theoxeny that the proem to the \"Catalogue\" presented as a defining characteristic of the heroic age and to the epithalamium of the couple that was sung in a later book. In the \"Aeneid\" Vergil closes his catalogue of combatants with the swift female warrior Camilla, alluding to the Hesiodic account of Iphiclus' speed in \"a remarkably subtle nod to tradition in the best Alexandrian style.\" Ovid picked up on Vergil's allusion in the \"Metamorphoses\" with his treatment of Atalanta, which recast's his Roman forbearer's allusion to Iphiclus in such a way that it highlights the Hesiodic character of his own poem in contrast with the Homeric character of the \"Aeneid\".\n\nIt is impossible to tell exactly when the last complete copy of the \"Catalogue\" was lost. Fragments of over fifty ancient copies have been found, dating from the Hellenistic period through early Byzantine times. A book label from the century or so after the latest \"Catalogue\" papyrus lists the contents of a fifth- or sixth-century Hesiodic codex as \"Hesiod's \"Theogony\", \"Works and Days\" and \"Shield\"\", and it appears that by this time the Byzantine triad of Hesiod's works had become the notional corpus, to the detriment of the other poems which had traveled under the poet's name. Knowledge of the \"Catalogue\" did not cease altogether with the loss of the final complete copy, however, and well into medieval times authors such as Eustathius and Tzetzes could cite the poem via fragments contained in other ancient authors. Other vestiges of the poem's influence are less clear: the Pseudo-Apollodoran \"Bibliotheca\", an early Roman-era handbook of Greek mythology, for example, is widely believed to have taken the \"Catalogue\" as its primary structural model, although this is not stated explicitly within that text.\n\nThe collection and interpretation of the Hesiodic fragments in the modern era began during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, primarily with the editions of and . The earliest collections simply presented ancient quotations organized by the quoting author, and it was not until the work of , and that attempts at a proper reconstruction began. Marckscheffel was the first to recognize that the early portions of the poem treated the descendants of Deucalion in a systematic fashion, but he regarded what were called the \"\"Catalogue of Women\"\" and \"\"Ehoiai\"\" as two initially separate works that had been joined: the former was genealogically structured, while the latter, in Marckscheffel's view, simply recounted myths involving notable Thessalian and Boeotian heroines, with each introduced by the \"ē' hoiē\"-formula. Since the Ehoie of Alcmene was attested for book 4, Marckscheffel proposed that books 1–3 were the \"\"Catalogue\"\", and books 4 and 5 were the \"\"Ehoiai\"\".\n\nAs the nineteenth century progressed, there were several other important observations about the genealogical structure of the \"Catalogue\". In 1860 Adolf Kirchhoff noted the mass of information connected to the family of Io, a stemma which could be assigned to the third book because of an ancient citation placing Phineus, one of her descendants, there. The picture of the \"Catalogue\" that was emerging began to resemble the \"Bibliotheca\" in structure, but Theodor Bergk was the first to suggest explicitly (though in passing) that the poem might be reconstructed with the help of the mythographic work. Bergk and his contemporaries still largely followed Marckscheffel's conclusion that the \"Catalogue\" and \"Ehoiai\" were semi-distinct texts, and it was not until 1894 that Friedrich Leo finally demonstrated that these were in fact alternate titles for a single poem.\n\nA few years before Leo's paper, the first small papyrus fragment was found, and the first half of the twentieth century would see the publication of several other pieces which added significantly to the modern text of the \"Catalogue\". Among these finds were important passages, the Catalogue of Suitors and Epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis for example, but few advanced the modern understanding of the work's overall structure. The appearance of the proem in 1956 actually led to a major misapprehension, for the list of gods found therein, beginning with Zeus and proceeding through the divine Heracles, led some to believe that the \"Catalogue\" was not organized in a strictly genealogical manner, but presented the unions of gods and heroines organized to some extent by amorous deity. Six years later, with the publication of the 28th part of the \"Oxyrhynchus Papyri\", the corpus of papyrus witnesses to the fragmentary Hesiodic poems was nearly doubled, with the lion's share of these new texts belonging to the \"Catalogue\". The new papyri proved once and for all that the poem was organized by genealogies of the great families in a way similar to the \"Bibliotheca\", and that the poet's use of the \"ē' hoiē\"-formula was not a random method of introduction but an organizing tool within an overall structure.\n\n\n\n\n"}
