As of 2010, it has an estimated population of 2,000, compared to an estimated 2,400 who actually live on the island; they have traditional names such as \"vaches\" (French for \"cows\") and \"lapins\" (French for \"rabbits\", given after the rabbits found in the island). The town has the old world charm of a French town, with cobbled streets, cottages, restaurants, houses, residents and pubs. It dominates much of the island, almost extending up to the Braye Harbour to its north, which is the main port of entry to the island and the town. It is located on a high ground at the centre of the island on the northwest direction.\n\nVictoria Street, founded in 1836 and serving as the town's main thoroughfare, is the commercial hub with shops, pubs and restaurants, along with banking and post office services flanking both sides of the street. The town hall is an impressive building and the museum presents pictures of the island with dramatic presentation of its military history; the town and the island having earned the epithet \"Gibraltar of the Channel\" during wartime. France is seen from here, as it is only away from the island. The \"Alderney Journal\", the locally produced newspaper, has an office on Ollivier Street.\n\nThe Luftwaffe command bunker and tower and the German naval tactical headquarters were both located in St Anne during the Second World War.\n\nSt Anne is also the name of the only parish (Church of England) in the island. The ancient parish church dedicated to the Virgin Mary, which was at the lower end of the main street, fell into ruins and was replaced in the late 1580s by a chapel of St. Anne. The parish church of St. Anne was renovated in 1850. After the Second World War, the church was renovated again.\n\nThe climate in St. Anne is temperate, moderated by the sea, and summers are usually warmer than elsewhere in the British Isles.\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, St. Anne has an oceanic climate, however it exhibits characteristics of a Warm-summer Mediterranean climate(csb). St. Anne experiences cool, wet winters and mild summers with moderate rainfall. February is the coldest month with an average high of 8 C ( F), and a low of 6 C ( F). July and August are the warmest months, with an average high of 18 C ( F), and a low of 15 C ( F). December is the wettest month with of rain, and June is the driest month with . Snow is very rare. Average Sunshine hours are around 1930 annually.\n\nThe founding of St Anne can be traced to the 15th century. During the Second World War, in the period between 1940 and 1945, Germans occupied the entire island, with their headquarters and military establishments located at St. Anne. The island's entire population, including that of the town, was evacuated before the islands were invaded in 1940. The Germans converted the place into a concentration camp; the labour force of 6,000 suffered untold miseries and many fatalities.\n\nDuring this period the island and the town became a German fort. The Luftwaffe built a bunker and tower in the town. The tower, known as a \"water tower\", was a multistorey structure which housed the Headquarters of the German Defence Forces of Army, Navy and Air Force. All these units had their own establishments with bunkers and reinforced structures, each with independent telecommunication network facilities. The defence system featured a network of tunnels dug in the several islands, including Jersey, Guernsey and Alderney. Within Alderney, nine such tunnels connected all the fortifications, with the headquarters centred at St Anne. These tunnels had a clear rock cover of , which made them impregnable to aerial bombing. Though there is an associated eeriness with the wartime fortifications, they have established their own importance by creating a close-knit community who live in peace and enjoy their life in the present.\n\nThe court house in New Street, also used for sittings of the States of Alderney, dates originally from 1850. The court room was destroyed by the German occupying forces but rebuilt in 1955.\n\nAlderney's records were mostly destroyed during the Second World War, but Family History Volunteers have compiled all of the available records, both civil (except censuses) and ecclesiastical, and have contacted those persons who could provide further information. Several hundred families in various regions of the island, with genealogies tracing to the 1800s, have been categorized as old Alderney families, Breakwater families and others, with family names of Duplain, Gaudion, Hougez, Le Vallée, Ollivier, Pezet, Audoire, Batiste, Barbenson and Renier, Le Cocq, Le Mesurier, Sebire and Simon. As the island was re-surveyed after the German occupation, no land records are available for the period before 1945, although baptism registers since 1662 have been located from several sources.\n\nBritish Pound and Guernsey Pound are the legal tender on the island. Commemorative coins of Alderney have been issued since 1989.\n\nSome of the noted places in St Anne town are St Anne's Church, the Island Hall and the St Anne Museum. Public facilities include the logically arranged network of harbour, roads, airport, railway (the only one in the Channel Islands), school and hospital.\n\nThe St Anne Church, dedicated to St Anne, Mother of the Blessed Virgin Mary, is centrally located in the St Anne town on the side of a hill between Victoria Street (from which it is approached through the Albert Gate) and La Vallee. It is surrounded by a well tended churchyard. The new church, which involved substantial renovation of the old church building, was designed by George Gilbert Scott, a renowned architect of Victorian buildings. Renovation of the old church involved the demolition of an ancient medieval building in the old churchyard, next to the present day island museum. The clock tower of the old church and the cemetery were retained, however. The renovation was completed and consecration held in 1850. Reverend Canon John Le Mesurier, son of the last Hereditary Governor of Alderney, built it in memory of his parents and fully met the cost of renovation, then estimated at about £8,000.\n\nThe main church, cruciform in the “transitional style from Norman to Early English with a clear French influence”, is an ornate structure built of local granite with Caen stone dressings, with a high altar with solid round pillars and the nave supporting towering arches. It became an archetype model for six other churches built by the same architect. The original six Victorian bells were removed during the German invasion; four were taken to Cherbourg to be melted for making munitions, and two were found in Alderney. All six bells were recast by Taylor's of Loughborough in 1953.\n\nDuring the Second World War, when the town was under German occupation and all its citizens had vacated the town, the church was used as a store, and its premises were damaged. A machine-gun post was set up then in the belfry, and still-visible graffiti on the stone work left by soldiers bears mute witness to the occupation. Pews had been removed from the church premises. After the war, the church figured in substantial restoration work in the town, completed in 1953. The Bishop of Winchester rededicated the church on 11 June of that year. A redeeming event recorded in 1998 was the restoration of an old Bible dated 1683 and bound in with a copy of the Book of Common Prayer and a Metrical Psalter dated 1679. It was partially damaged by dampness but had been substituted with manuscript sheets exquisitely engraved in small copper plates. The Bible was restored to the church by the widow of a soldier who had taken it from there and had stored it in his library in Germany.\n\nIn view of its large size, the church is famously called the “Cathedral of the Channel Islands.” It was intended to serve not only as a parish church but also as a fortified garrison for the defence forces stationed in the island. Approach to the present church is through the Albert Memorial Entrance, which is a granite arch with wrought iron gates, opposite to Oliver Street.\n\nAlderney Society Museum, the principal museum in Alderney, is located in the Old School House on High Street in central St Anne. Exhibits there fully reflect the history of the town and include a collection of rare maps, a list of British regiments stationed in Alderney starting with 1732, old records, the 1940 Census of Alderney, finds of the Elizabethan shipwreck, and many rare artefacts. The museum is administered by the Alderney Society, which established it in 1966 with the purpose of creating \"an organisation dedicated to the historical, environmental and scientific promotion of the island of Alderney\". The museum was fully registered in 1993 and received the Museums and Galleries’ Gulbenkian Award for \"most outstanding achievement\" presented by Charles, Prince of Wales in 1999.\n\nRoyal Connaught Square in the heart of the town takes its name from Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, who visited the island with Queen Victoria. Island Hall on the north side of the square was built in 1763 by Governor John Le Mesurier and served as Alderney's Government House, and later as a Catholic convent school. It now houses the library and museum. Nearby is Les Mouriaux House, which was built in 1779 by Peter Le Mesurier, John's son, and later visited by Queen Victoria and then Queen Elizabeth II in 1956. It was the residence of the first President of Alderney, Captain Sidney Herivel, from 1949 to 1970. Connaught (Irish: Connacht), is one of the four provinces of Ireland.\n\nThe town and the island are easily accessible by sea and air. France is across the sea. It is 32 km (20 mi) to the north-east corner of the Bailiwick of Guernsey (of which it is a part) and 97 km (60 mi) from the south coast of England.\nIts main port of entry, including for freight, is Braye Harbour, a commercial harbour, a short distance to the north of the town. Also known as the Alderney Harbour, it is located on the north side of the island at the mouth of the English Channel. It has one of the longest harbour walls in Europe and is, in fact, the longest such harbour wall in the British Isles. The harbour faces out onto the Swinge, which is part of the English Channel. It is more or less a suburb of St Anne, which is a large settlement in Alderney about away from the harbour. Harbour precincts have the ambiance of an industrial establishment with all harbour facilities, a knitwear factory, a sailing club, toilets and a handful of places offering food and drink.\n\nThe three runway Alderney Airport is about from the town. Alderney Airport is the only airport on the island of Alderney. Built in 1935 and operating since 1936, Alderney Airport was the first airport in the Channel Islands. Located southwest of St Anne, it is the closest Channel Island airport to the south coast of England and the coast of France.\n\nAurigny Air Services. (founded in Alderney in 1968), are the only commercial airline that operate flights to and from this airport.\n\nSt Anne has a salubrious climate with plenty of sunshine. It offers various tourist activities like walking on the cliffs, golfing, fishing, and windsurfing. Sporting facilities are available in the area, including Alderney Cricket Club and Alderney Golf Course, situated to the east of St Anne. The town has a primary school, a secondary school and a post office as well as hotels, restaurants, banks and shops.\n\nThe court house in New Street, also used for sittings of the States of Alderney, dates originally from 1850. The court room was destroyed by the German occupying forces but rebuilt in 1955.\n\nThe main town is given the epithets, \"piquant picturesque town\" and \"pastel painted village\" and is also called St. Anne. The main cemetery is Longis Cemetery.\n\nThe principal hospital on Alderney is the Mignot Memorial Hospital, located in the northern part of St. Anne. Serving a population of 2,400, the hospital was established in 2008 and has 24 beds, twelve of which are designated for medical, post-operative, maternity, or paediatric care.\n\nAs Alderney, unlike the UK, is not covered by the National Health Service, the hospital is effectively a private practice in which a fee is payable for all care provided. Treatment received by patients in the Accidents and Emergency Department and immediate necessary treatment given by a GP, however, is without charge.\n\nThe hospital has two local general practitioners and visiting specialists—especially from the Princess Elizabeth Hospital in Guernsey, which acts as the Mignot Hospital's parent institution—hold out-patient clinics. The hospital has a 24-hour accident and emergency clinic, a physiotherapy department and a small radiography unit. Women giving birth are generally taken to Guernsey.\n\nA.C. Swinburne's poem \"Les Casquets\" is based on the Houguez family, who actually lived on those islets for 18 years. The Houguez were originally from Alderney, and the poem describes their life on Les Casquets. The daughter falls in love with a carpenter from Alderney, but moving to his island finds life there too busy. She finds the \"small bright streets of serene St Anne\" and \"the sight of the works of men\" too much and returns to Les Casquets.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2213491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213491", "title": "Kaliyan", "text": "Kaliyan\n\nKali (Kaliyan in Tamil) was the sixth fragment of the primordial manifestation of Kroni (evil) according to Akilathirattu, the source of Ayyavazhi mythology and the holy book of Ayyavazhi religion. Unlike other previous manifestations, Kali spread in this yugam (yukam in Tamizh) as maya (illusion). Details of Kali were restated in Ayyavazhi Religion and he is the same Kali mentioned in Kalki Purana.\n\nAs the time is close to the ascendancy of Kali Yuga, a sage named Guru Muni told Shiva, \"Your greatness, the Kroni was created and fragmented into six parts. Five of those parts were made to take birth. However, because none of them obeyed you, all were destroyed by Vishnu(Mayon/Thirumal in Tamizh), and his spirit (the spirit Vishnu took only in the Avatars) was kept in Parvatha Ucchi Malai (In Sanskrit 'uccha' means high, in Tamil 'malai' means mountain). Nonetheless, by the \"sixth\" fragment, Kroni still has a birth in Kali Yugam.\" He also requested that in this yugam his sixth fragment should be created with a body with eight \"chans\" (spans - distance from the end of the thumb to the end of the little finger extended). Shiva made a proposal to create Kali, in the following manner.\n\nAccepting Guru Muni's request, Shiva replied, \"Good. Didn't Vishnu have to come?\" Deva Muni replied, \"Vishnu was in his ‘Sleep of Wisdom’ (sleeping) in the world.\" Hearing this, Shiva assembled the following beings: Vasishta Guru of Govuha(? Needs Sanskrit equivalent), Devas of Deiva Lokam, the members of Vaikunta Lokam Kinneras(Kina nathar in Tamizh), Kimpurusha(Kimburudar in Tamizh),and members from all other worlds. He also assembled all the Deiva Ganas. Then he asked the gathering, Is Vishnu in Vaikuntam? If he is not there, then where is he? The conclave repeated that, Vishnu was dead lying (without any activities) in the lower world (Earth).\n\nHearing this, Shiva replied, \"All the previous five fragments were destroyed since they did not respect us. Now it’s his sixth birth, but, even now, he doesn’t realize that no other chances will be provided and he will be sentenced to death. And so, in this birth, he will be created as a human being with the following talents: aesthetics, wisdom, beauty, and sharp intelligence. In the previous Yugas, Vishnu took a body of four spans and head one span. In this yuga, Kali will be given a body the same size of that of Vishnu in all previous yugas. That way, Kali will have no reason for his defeat to argue that is similar to the previous ones. Does anyone have any opinions or objections about it?\" The proposal was accepted unanimously by the Devas, chiranjeevin sages, and the brahmins, those who read scriptures. Therefore, Shiva decided to create Kali.\n\nAt the very moment Shiva made his decision, Kali formed, as a human male, and pushed himself out of the earth in an inverted form. All of Shiva's advisors were amazed and moved by this sight. All of those who witnessed the creation of Kali went to Sivan and reported it to him. At once, Shiva rise from his seat and started walking to see this wonder. Then Nandhi/Nandheesha(Nantheesurar in Tamizh) came across him and said, \"Your greatness, you are the one who can’t wholly be known, even by devas. Why are you here? Can I know the reason?\" Sivan replied, \"I heard that there is a being, born inverted, against dhanam (rule of the land), whose legs were towards sky and head towards flower (flower here - earth). So I am going there, because I want to see it for myself\". Hearing this, Nandhi complained, \"Dhanam was overtaken, not there, but here. If something happened, you would normally be on your seat, up in Kayilai, and you would control everything. But now all the procedures are disintegrated. Because you stood up from your seat, the whole world will suffer and the dharmam will dissolve. Warfare and deception will rule the world. The land will lack rainfall. The true scripture, which tells about the Brahmam, will be substantially lost.\" Because of his complaint, Nandhi, along with Siva, returned to Kailaasham.(Kayilai in Tamizh)\n\nAfter getting back to Kailaasham, Nandhi told Shiva, \"We'll call Chithira Buthira (Chithira Buthira in Tamizh) and ask him to describe Kali\". This request was honored. Chithra Buthira described Kali thusly: \"He was born from the sixth fragment of Kroni. His body was made by assembling earth, sky and fire. The water will be Kali's strength. The vayu (air) will be the prana for him. Kali will be the most cruel one, of all the six fragments.\" Chithira Buthira also noted that Mayon had taken a 4-span body in the previous yugas, as Narasimha, Rama, and Krishna, and so Kali, in this yuga, was born with the body of same size, and he pushed himself out of the earth.\n\nAfter hearing this, Shiva asked Chitra Buthira to tell about Kali's lifespan, qualities, and power. Chitra Buthira responded with a narrative. Buthira said, \"Because [Kali] was born without the instrumentality of normal human parentage, all the 96 Tatvas in his physique are rude and unrefined. Also, because of his unusual birth, he would have his intelligence and five senses rooted in falsehood. His eyes, legs and head will lead Kali towards sin. His nature is not knowing the true nature of the things here. He will have a life span of about a hundred years, and he will attain maturity at the age of fourteen. He will have about ten hundred thousand drops of semen in his body.\" (Some sources claim this as 10 lakh drops of blood, not semen). \"He will attain full bodily maturity at the age of 31. Kali's body, which was built up with blood, bone, veins and muscle, are made of water and earth, and this is used for nothing (useless). His body will have 9 openings outside. This toy (i.e., body) will be controlled by a bird (i.e., soul), and when it’s time for the bird to go, it will fly away, leaving the toy here, and thereby the bird will have no relation with the toy. This bird and the body is free for him in this yuga. And until the bird is with him, Kali's savageness cannot be tolerated. Since his nature is like this, and since he is built up of savageness, he will not be thankful.\"\n\nShiva, now even more interested in Kali, wanted to see him, so after a deep discussion, Shiva asked Yama, demons, Durga, and 3 crore (or 30 million) ghosts to bring him to Kailasham. All of them went in front of Kali and told him that, \"You are asked by Shiva to come to Kailasham\". Kali gave a lackluster response. He rolled over, but still his head was inside the earth and the earth was sticky. He was not able to come out. The sky ignored the going-ons as well. Because of this failure to come out, Kailasham trembled, and the witnesses shivered. So some of the spooked witnesses headed to Kailasham and told Shiva that Kali was unable to come out, and the earth was suffering because of that failure. Shiva made a plan. He asked a kammalan, or craftsman, to make a single fork, and asked Nandhi to carry Kali out, using that fork. This proved successful: Nandhi took the fork, walked towards Kali, and took him out of the earth with the fork. As soon as Kali was out, the resulting opening in the earth promptly shut. All of the parties at the site then pulled Kali to Kailasham and presented him to Shiva.\n\nWhen Kali was presented to Shiva, Shiva asked Kali, \"What would you like to have?\". Kali, asking the devas or a third party, said, \"Is that fellow ready to give me what I need, because he wears a snake on his neck and ash on his forehead, and because he sits on an elephant skin?\" Kali disgraced Shiva with this question, causing the devas to advise Kali, \"Don’t disgrace Shiva. He was the one who created the world. He was the one who offered food for every life in the world. He was the light which was not even visible to Mayon and Vethan. (This is an allusion to when Shiva appeared in a form of endless lingam of light when there was a dispute between Mayon and Nathan as to who is the greatest and in order to subdue their pride.) Don't worry, he will be able to give what you claim.\" Kali replied, \"If he was the one who made the world, ask him to create a beautiful girl for me.\"\n\nAs per his request, a lady named Durukthi was created from his left rib-bone. And then Kali understood the power of Sivan.\n\nSeeing all these, the Devas asked Kali to thank Shiva, and the Devas also asked him to claim the boons (blessings and permissions). Kali accepted this, saying, \"Your highness, thank you for creating a lady for me. Would you mind giving me other items I need?\" Shiva told, \"What do you want?\" Since Shiva had agreed to offer Kali boons, he started asking for boons which control the whole Universe. This panicked all of the logas, who shivered on hearing the boons of Kali.\n\nUpon hearing of this fright, Shiva asked Parvathi what to do. She replied, \"You must satisfy all of Kali's requests, but the fulfillment should be performed under technique.\" Shiva provided those boons in a roundabout way: he created a man named Agastya(Agatheesar in tamizh, Agasthyar in Grantha Tamizh) with his mind, so that the boons would be given through that man. Agastya was also created with great knowledge of every subject. Having done this, Shiva ordered the newly made Agastya to give Kali all of the boons that he had claimed. Obeying this, Agastya Rushi offered all the boons to Kali and taught him all of the subjects, including the 'Technique of Living Forever'. Subsequently, Agastya reported those accomplishments to Sivan. Among the boons reportedly given (or sold to) Kali, according to Agastya, were the Chakram and Crown of Vishnu. Agastya concluded in his report, \"If all these boons are with [Kali], it is impossible to destroy him.\"\n\nThe boons were:\n\nHe asked that by these techniques he might live in this world with the dynasty of people born from his semen. And he also asked that all his Five senses should not forget the women (i.e.) his wife Kalicchi.\n\nMeanwhile, Vishnu, in the form of an old beggar (Pantaram in Tamizh) on his way to say good-bye to Shiva, met with Kali. Vishnu asked Kali to donate him some of the boons which was given to him. Otherwise, Vishnu threatened, he would overwhelm Kali physically and then proceed with Kali's boons. Kali retorted, \"You are an age-old person. Also, you have no army and no sword or any weapons. If I quarrel with you, even the lady on my side will degrade me. So how about this: why not move aside, and leave?\". Then Vishnu replied, \"Ok, make me a promise [to behave nicely].\" Kali asked, \"What should I make a promise on?\" Vishnu responded, \"Promise on your boons, kingdom, your lady, your military and your dynasty.\" Kali thus declared: \"I promise that if I create any troubles to beggars on earth, I, my lady, my boons, my kingdoms, and my military will all fail, my dynasty and I will die, and both my dynasty and I will go to hell.\" As Kali made his oath, Vishnu got the Chakram from Kali, cursed the Chakram as Money, and gave it back to him. As soon as it was cursed, the chakram asked Vishnu, \"When will your curse finish?\". Vishnu replied, \"It'll be away from you when Kali is defeated.\" Because Kali now had this new money, Kali told Durukthi, \"We now have whatever we need.\" Kali went to Shiva and asked him to allow him to go to the world. By this point, Vishnu had asked the Devas to write down all the happenings perfectly, and he was already walking towards Vaikuntam.\n\nKali and Durukthi's entrance into the world caused a universal disaster. Upon seeing the two newcomers, all the good animals, birds, reptiles, and even ethics (Neethi in Samskrtham) quit the world. The Animal kingdom started to experience immense torture. A large number of species all departed for Vaikuntam when Kali entered the world: White Elephants, White Lions, White tigers, Five-headed Snakes, White Swans, White Cuckoos, White Doves, White Peacocks, White Cobras, White Wolves, White Garudas, Hanuman, White Crows, White Deers, and Good Rhinoceros. The good Pearls, good Gems, the old Vedas, and good Shastras, also disappeared from the world. The Trishanku (Trichangu in Tamizh) went deep into the sea, along with everything originating in the sea. Gold went into the earth. All the idols of Gods, temples and the sutras (formulas) went into the water and earth. The rain which, up to this point, had fallen three times a month, stopped. Beautiful flowers vanished.\n\nAs the wicked Kali came to the world, the ocean waves became angry and washed away many parts of land. All the ethical people went into the forest from the country. There the eldest one among Pancha pandavas, Yudhishthira asked the Dharma Neethi \"If all of you have gone away, how can we get to Vaikuntam?\". The Darma Neethi replied that the advent of Kali barred the ethical people from reaching Vaikuntam, and thus the Dharma Neethi were going to Vishnu. So the Panchapandavas followed them and headed to Vishnu.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2213507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213507", "title": "Dick Savitt", "text": "Dick Savitt\n\nRichard Savitt (born March 4, 1927) is a right-handed American former tennis player.\n\nIn 1951, at the age of 24, he won both the Australian and Wimbledon men's singles championships. Savitt was mostly ranked World No. 2 the same year behind fellow amateur Frank Sedgman, though was declared World No. 1 by \"The New York Times\" following his Wimbledon victory. He retired the following year. Savitt is one of four American men who have won both the Australian and British Championships in one year, following Don Budge (1938) and preceding Jimmy Connors (1974) and Pete Sampras (1994 and 1997).\n\nHe is enshrined in the International Tennis Hall of Fame, the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Men's Collegiate Tennis Hall of Fame, the USTA Eastern Tennis Hall of Fame, the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, and the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nSavitt is Jewish, and was born in Bayonne, New Jersey. He taught himself tennis at the age of 14, but never took a tennis lesson in his life. The self-taught Savitt played tennis well enough, however, to make the finals of the New Jersey Boys Championship and, for two years afterward, the National Boys Tennis Tournament before moving up to the junior ranks.\n\nHis first love was basketball, though, and when his family moved to Texas, he was an All-State forward and a co-captain of his El Paso, Texas high school basketball team in 1944. In 1945 Savitt entered the Navy, and played on a service basketball team. Despite considering tennis his \"second\" sport after basketball, he won the Texas University Interscholastic League boys singles championship in 1944–45. Nationally he was the 8th-ranked junior tennis player, and the 17th-ranked amateur overall.\n\nBeginning in 1946, Savitt attended Cornell University, where he majored in economics, was a member of the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity, and was elected a member of the Sphinx Head Society. However, two injuries, one to his knee, curtailed his basketball career.\n\nSavitt resumed playing tennis. He became Cornell's tennis team captain, # 1 singles and doubles player. In 1947 he was ranked # 26 in the U.S., and two years later he was ranked # 17. In both 1949 and 1950, as a junior and a senior, he won the Eastern Intercollegiate Tournament, and he won the doubles title with Leonard Steiner from 1948–50. In 1950 he also won the East Clay Court Tournament and the New York State Tournament. He was 57–2 in singles for his college career, and graduated in June 1950.\n\nSavitt ranked in the world's top 10 four times between 1951 and 1957 (# 2 in 1951); and in the U.S. top 10 six times between 1950 and 1959. That was despite the fact that Savitt did not compete in 1953–55. Among Savitt's major victories were the 1951 Wimbledon singles championship and the 1951 Australian Open. He also won the 1952, 1958, and 1961 USLTA National Indoor Championships, becoming the first player to win that crown three times, and won the Italian doubles and the Canadian singles and doubles championships.\n\nWithout any coaching, in 1950 Savitt reached the U. S. Tennis Championship semifinals at Forest Hills, losing to Art Larsen. In 1951, at the age of 24, Savitt won the Wimbledon Singles Championship. Along the way he beat Larsen, the # 1 US player, in straight sets, and Herbert Flam, the # 2 US player. He also won the Australian Open Singles title, winning in straight sets in the 61-minute final. He became the first American since Don Budge, 13 years earlier, to win both Wimbledon and the Australian Open in one season.\n\nSavitt also became the first Jewish player to win either tournament. In the Jewish parts of North London, Savitt recalled, \"Nobody knew tennis there, but after I won people started picking up rackets\". In addition, he became the first Jewish athlete to appear on the cover of \"Time\" magazine. The significance of a Jewish tennis player succeeding was rooted in the fact that tennis was still at the time primarily a country club sport, and many country clubs often did not allow Jews in as members and did not allow them to use their courts. This, in turn, kept many Jewish tennis players from obtaining the training they needed to compete at the highest levels.\n\nSavitt was ranked 2nd in the world in 1951. He was also ranked the # 1 player on the United States Davis Cup Team. He made it to the semifinals of the Australian Open in January 1952. In February 1952 he beat Bill Talbert 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 to win the U.S. National Indoor championship. In September 1952, he beat Art Larsen 10-8, 6-3, 6-4 to win the Pacific Coast men's singles tennis championship.\n\nAlthough at the top of his game, and only 25 years old, Savitt abruptly retired from competitive tennis after winning the 1952 U.S. National Indoor Singles Championships. He never publicly discussed the reason for his sudden retirement, but it was considered most likely the result of his snub by the US Davis Cup coach.\n\nSavitt had played and won his three early 1951 Cup matches, winning 9 of 10 sets, en route to leading the American team into the championship round against Australia. Allison Danzig, the senior American tennis writer, called him America's best hope for victory. American Davis Cup coach Frank Shields, however, did not permit him to compete against the Aussies that he beat at Wimbledon and in Australia. He won against Australia's top seed Ken McGregor in three straight sets to win at Wimbledon, and won the Australian Singles championship, becoming the first non-Aussie to win that title in 13 years. He had also defeated Australia's best other player, Frank Sedgman, 6–3, 2–6, 6–3, 6–1 in the same tournament. Ted Schroeder, who had lost all three of his Davis Cup matches while losing 9 out of 10 sets in the process the year before and who was in semi-retirement, was chosen by Shield instead. Five of the top ten players in the U.S. publicly accused Shield of \"obvious prejudice\" in his choosing the team. Without Savitt playing singles, and with Schroder losing two of his three matches, the United States lost the 1951 Davis Cup to Australia.\n\nThe controversy spilled over into the next year, when the 1951 national rankings were bitterly debated at the January 1952 U.S. Lawn Tennis Association annual meeting. Members of the Association's Eastern, New England, Southern, Florida, and Texas delegations, whose chief spokesman was Gardnar Mulloy, were in favor of Savitt being named the No. 1 tennis player in the U.S. However, Frank Shields attacked Savitt in a \"biting\", \"unprecedented\" speech, which observers said swung the vote against Savitt. As it was reported by \"Time\" magazine, \"the loudest talker was Frank Shields, non-playing captain of the losing U.S. Davis Cup team. Shields had ignored Savitt in the Davis Cup matches, had put his confidence in aging (30) Ted Schroeder ... who turned out to be the goat of the series. Shields was intent on keeping Savitt ranked ... at No. 3. Cried Shields: 'Never once in the past three months has Savitt looked like a champion. Not only that, but he was not the most cooperative player in the world while we were in Australia, and his sounding off brought discredit to the game. He was not a credit either as a player or a representative of America.'\" Don McNeill, the 1940 U.S. champion, answered Shields's outburst by pointing out that players are ranked on their tennis ability, that personal prejudice should have nothing to do with ranking, and that Shields' remarks were \"uncalled for\". That met with \"resounding applause\" from the delegates. After the heated 5-hour session, one of the longest in U.S.L.T.A. history, President Russell Kingman called Shields's outburst \"most unseemly.\" Australian Davis Cup team Harry Hopman called his arguments as to why Savitt should not be ranked # 1 \"weak\". Still, a never-before-required proxy vote was needed to decide the # 1 spot. Savitt was ranked the No. 2 player in the U.S. by the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association, behind Vic Seixas and directly ahead of Tony Trabert. In February 1952, a distraught Savitt announced that he would play only one more tournament, the National Indoor Championships, and then retire from tournament tennis—at age 25.\n\nSavitt returned to the competitive tennis scene part-time in 1956. In 1958, Savitt moved back to New York for business reasons and launched a part-time comeback in tennis. That year, he won his second National Indoors title, and in 1961 he captured his third—while remaining a weekend player. In 1981, he and his son, Robert, won the U.S. Father-Son doubles title.\n\nIn his prime, Savitt was considered the game's greatest back-court player, with the hardest ground strokes. He also had a booming serve. Savitt was also enormously competitive. His contemporaries described him as almost driven, a man who hated to lose.\n\nIn 1961, he won gold medals in both singles and doubles (with Mike Franks) at the 1961 Maccabiah Games in Israel, the third-largest sporting event in the world. He was also very active in the Maccabi movement. Savitt in addition helped develop the Israel Tennis Centers, beginning in 1973. In 1998, he was the ITA overseas tennis director. In his 2007 book \"The Big Book of Jewish Sports Heroes: An Illustrated Compendium of Sports History and The 150 Greatest Jewish Sports Stars\", author Peter S. Horvitz ranked Savitt the 9th-greatest Jewish athlete of all time.\n\nHe was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1976. Savitt was also inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1979. He was inducted into the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Men's Collegiate Tennis Hall of Fame in 1986. Savitt was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1998, and into the USTA Eastern Tennis Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nAfter his tennis career, Savitt entered the oil business in Louisiana. He then worked for Lehman Brothers on Wall Street, and in 1985 joined Schroders.\n\n\n"}

It provides that each party is responsible for paying its own attorney's fees, unless specific authority granted by statute or contract allows the assessment of those fees against the other party. \n\nInternationally, the English rule is used, under which the losing party pays the prevailing party's attorneys' fees.\n\nThe American rule is merely a default rule, not the blanket rule in the United States. Many statutes at both the federal and state levels allow the winner to recover reasonable attorney's fees, and there are two major exceptions in federal case law as well. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1), federal statutes may supersede the default rule of not awarding attorney fees. The Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act is one such federal law. 28 U.S.C. § 1927 authorizes federal courts to award attorneys’ fees and expenses against any attorney who unreasonably and vexatiousness multiplies a proceeding. Federal courts also possess inherent authority to assess attorney’s fees and litigation costs against a plaintiff who has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly or for oppressive reasons. \n\nSeveral states also have exceptions to the American rule in both statutes and case law. For example, in California, the Consumers Legal Remedies Act allows plaintiffs to recover attorney's fees, and in insurance bad faith cases, a policyholder may be able to recover attorney's fees as a separate component of damages. Nevada Rule of Civil Procedure 68 is unique in that a party who declines a pretrial offer of judgment (essentially a settlement offer) and fails to obtain a better result at trial is liable for all reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by the offeror after the time the offer was given.\n\nIn May 2017, the state of Oklahoma unintentionally removed the American rule for all civil cases not involving real property. House Bill 1470 was originally intended to increase the age at which victims of child sexual abuse could sue their abusers from 20 to 45. An amendment removing the American rule was added before the bill passed both houses of the legislature and was signed into law by Governor Mary Fallin. According to the original author of the Senate's version of the bill, the amendment was initially believed to apply only to losers of civil cases involving child sexual abuse, but the scope of the amendment proved far greater than many legislators intended. The new law took effect on November 1, 2017, and a spokesperson for Fallin said that legislators had several options for correcting the apparent error before that time.\n\nThe rationale for the American rule is that people should not be discouraged from seeking redress for perceived wrongs in court or from trying to extend coverage of the law. The rationale continues that society would suffer if a person was unwilling to pursue a meritorious claim merely because that person would have to pay the defendant's expenses if they lost.\n\n"}

Regarded as a liberal with \"sound Progressive credentials,\" he served as a member of H. H. Asquith's cabinet as Secretary for Scotland between 1912 and 1916 and as Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster between July and December 1916. He was also involved in London politics and served as Chairman of the London County Council between 1898 and 1899.\n\nBorn in Stepney, Wood was the only son of Hugh Wood, a merchant and shipowner, by his second wife Jessie McKinnon, daughter of Reverend Thomas McKinnon. His father had been born in Orkney, where his father was a farmer, but had later settled in London. Wood was educated at the Brewers' Company School, Aldenham, Hertfordshire, Mill Hill School, and University College, London. He graduated in 1875 with honours in logic and moral philosophy. After graduating, he worked briefly on the 9th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, before joining the family business in 1878, after his father lost his sight.\n\nWood was a member of the London County Council for Central Hackney from 1892 to 1909. From 1897 to 1908 he was leader of the Progressive Party and also served as Chairman of the council from 1898 to 1899. In 1907 he was appointed alderman, a post he held until 1909. He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for the County of London in 1899.\n\nWood stood unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate for East Islington in 1895, Glasgow St. Rollox in 1900 and Orkney and Shetland in 1902. However, in 1906 he was elected for Glasgow St Rollox as a Liberal, a seat he held until 1918. In April 1908 Wood was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education in the administration of H. H. Asquith, a post he held until October of the same year, when he became Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.\n\nIn 1911 he was made Financial Secretary to the Treasury and admitted to the Privy Council. The following year he was promoted to Secretary for Scotland with a seat in the cabinet. He continued in this post also when the war-time coalition was formed in May 1915. His integrity was called into question over the 1908 -1919 Oscar Slater case and inquiries into his false conviction for murder. In July 1916 he was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Financial Secretary to the Treasury. The latter post was considered very important in the war-time situation, and was not seen as a demotion.\n\nHowever, when Lloyd George became Prime Minister in December 1916, Wood was not offered a post in the government. By the time the general election of December 1918 was held, Wood was an anti-coalition Asquith Liberal. In common with most of the Liberals who did not receive the \"Coalition Coupon\" he lost his seat, which was gained by Gideon Oliphant-Murray of the Conservative Party. He made one attempt to re-enter the Commons when he stood unsuccessfully for Hackney Central in 1922.\n\nWood married Isabella Sandison, daughter of Alexander Sandison, in 1883. They had eight children, six sons and two daughters. Two sons and one daughter predeceased him. Wood died in South Kensington two weeks after his wife in March 1927, aged 72. Following a funeral service at Whitefield's Tabernacle, Tottenham Court Road, Wood was buried in Highgate Cemetery. He left estate valued at £130,372.\n\n"}

It is set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting for \"Dungeons & Dragons\" (D&D). The story was written by R.A. Salvatore and features the voices of Patrick Stewart as Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun and Michael Clarke Duncan as Ygorl.\n\nThere are three playable characters in \"Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone\", each with his or her own unique abilities: the fighter Rannek, is a master of melee combat; the sorcerer Illius, can cast spells over long range; and a half-drow, half-wood-elf rogue named Zhai easily vanishes into the shadows before sneaking up on her enemy for the kill.\n\nThe two villains are equally enemies of the heroes and of each other. The first villain—Ygorl—is the leader of the Slaad army. Cireka, general of the Githyanki, is the second. The game's introduction explains that the only thing keeping each of them from taking over the realm is their hatred of each other. Fearing that the realm would be at the mercy of whichever villain was victorious, the great mage Khelben Blackstaff sealed them both within a Demon Stone.\n\nThe story develops as the three heroes battle two orc armies near the jewel-rich Gemspark Mines. A great red dragon, sent by Ygorl, leads the group to these mines. Once there, they unwittingly release Ygorl and Cireka from the Demon Stone and into the world. The three heroes must undo their mistake by joining forces to right the wrong they caused.\n\nR.A. Salvatore wrote the game's script, which begins with Rannek, a human fighter, stumbling across a battle between two orc armies. As he comes to the aid of wood elves captured by the orcs, a half-drow, half-elf named Zhai and a sorcerer named Illius join the battle. Ultimately, Rannek, Zhai, and Illius are driven into the nearby Gemspark Mines by a dragon, Caminus. Inside the mines, they accidentally release the warlords Ygorl and Cireka from their imprisonment in a Demon Stone. The three escape from the warlords and decide to join forces to imprison them again.\n\nAfter evacuating the nearby wood-elf village of Cedarleaf, attacked by Cireka and her Githyanki soldiers, they visit Illius' mentor, Khelben Blackstaff, for advice. He says that they will need a new Demon Stone; one could be found in the possession of the Yuan-ti people. As the three leave, Ygorl arrives riding Caminus and attacks Khelben's tower. The tower is destroyed as the three escape.\n\nAfter they defeat the Yuan-ti and claim the Demon Stone, they go to see Drizzt Do'Urden, a drow that does not follow the normally cruel ways of his people, hoping he can help them find Cireka. He directs them to an abandoned portal in the Underdark, as that would be where she would feel most comfortable. When they find the portal, they also find Cireka and her Githyanki horde ready to make use of it. As the three battle the Githyanki, Ygorl arrives with his Slaad horde. Illius tries to imprison the two warlords in the Demon Stone, but Ygorl forces himself and Cireka through the portal before Illius can succeed. The three follow the warlords through the portal to the lair of Caminus. There, Cireka is killed by the dragon, and Ygorl flees through another portal. The three work together to slay Caminus, then pursue Ygorl through the portal.\n\nThe portal takes them back to Gemspark Mines. After fighting their way past Ygorl's hoard, they use a portal that leads to Limbo, where Ygorl waits for them. There, the heroes engage in a final duel with Ygorl, ultimately slaying him. They are welcomed back at Cedarleaf as heroes. Here, Khelben Blackstaff arrives through a portal, having survived the assault on his tower. He brings them the king's thanks and the offer of the untamed land of Vasa to be their own.\n\nPlayers have control over all three characters and can change character at any time (after all three main heroes arrive). There are many fighting moves, and players must use each character's skills to play the game effectively. Rannek uses a sword and breaks things with his gauntlets. Illius fights with a staff and uses magic (the game's most powerful ranged attack; the other two can throw knives (Zhai) or axes (Rannek)). Zhai uses two daggers and becomes invisible in shadows—this is useful for sneaking up on enemies and killing them. Bosses overpower characters in one-on-one fighting but can be defeated with the combined power of all three heroes. Although much of the game is hack-and-slash, there are several tasks that require the use of various skills.\n\nThe game received a positive response from critics. Heather Newman of the \"Detroit Free Press\" called the game \"extraordinarily cinematic\", adding that \"the dialogue and story line Salvatore crafted substantially contributed to that feel.\" Judy Siegel-Itzkovich of the \"Jerusalem Post\" gave the game four and half stars. She praised the graphics as \"excellent\", and the sound, calling the music \"rousing and dramatic\", the voice acting \"high quality\", and the sound effects \"highly realistic\". She concluded by saying that while fans would love the game, it is too short and the hack and slash element becomes \"repetitive\".\n\n\"Demon Stone\" was nominated for two awards by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), and four awards by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences.\n\n\n"}

The emerging threat of aerial bombing, however, prompted the government to consider dispersing its ordnance factories around the country.\n\nThe majority of the ROFs were built during the re-armament period, just before the start of the Second World War, to enhance the capacity of the three ordnance sites that had continued in operation after the end of the First World War: the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, the Royal Gunpowder Factory (RGPF) Waltham Abbey, Essex and the Royal Small Arms Factory, (RSAF) Enfield. These three sites were in or near London and were considered to be vulnerable to aerial bombing from continental Europe.\n\nThe Royal Arsenal designed many of the ROFs and was also the agent for the construction of all of the Rifles ROFs, the Medium Machine ROF and the Small Arms Ammunition ROFs. The Ministry of Supply, the Ministry of Works, and two other private companies were agents for the construction of the remaining ROFs.\n\nA number of Second World War munitions factories were built, and owned, by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). These ICI Nobel Explosives owned factories were not considered part of the Ministry of Supply's Royal Ordnance Factory organization, and they were not called ROFs. ICI also managed munitions factories constructed with Ministry of Supply funding. These were known as \"agency factories\" and three of them became part of Royal Ordnance upon the ROFs' privatisation.\n\nSome of the ROF Filling Factories built later, during the Second World War, were government-owned, but managed, as Agency Factories, by private companies unconnected with the explosives industry. For example, Joseph Lyons & Co ran ROF Elstow throughout the war. Other Filling Factories were run by Imperial Tobacco, Courtaulds, the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS), Metal Closures and Lever Brothers.\n\nThe new ROFs were to be built in areas regarded as \"relatively safe\". Until 1940, this meant from Bristol, in the south, and then west of a line that ran from (roughly) Weston-super-Mare, in Somerset, northwards to Haltwhistle, Northumberland; and then northwestwards to Linlithgow, in Scotland. The South, South East and East of England were regarded as \"dangerous\" and the Midlands area, including Birmingham as \"unsafe\". This definition of \"safe\" area was later changed, and in 1940 ignored in the case of ROF Chorley.\n\nSiting of the individual ROFs north and west of this line was of vital importance. ROFs involved with explosive manufacture or filling needed, on safety grounds, to be located away from centres of population. However, they needed access to good transport links, such as railways; the availability of adequate workers within reasonable travelling distance; a plentiful guaranteed supply of clean process water; and (to avoid the danger of frozen explosives) tended to be located at or just above sea level. Some ROFs located in Wales and Scotland were the result of political lobbying as these areas had high unemployment rates in the 1930s. The ROFs were guarded by what was to become the Ministry of Defence Police.\n\nThe Royal Ordnance Factories were set up with six generic types of factories:\n\nThe three main types were: Engineering, Filling and Explosives.\n\nThe largest ROFs tended to be the Explosive ROFs and the Filling Factories as these needed an explosives safeguarding zone around the perimeter of the factory; as well as separation, or reduced separation and traverses, between buildings. ROF Bishopton occupied over and ROF Chorley was .\n\nEach ROF tended to be self-contained, apart from its raw materials: with their own coal-fired power stations, for generating steam for heating and process use, and electricity via high-pressure steam turbines if needed; engineering workshops; plumbers and chemical plumbers; leather workers; electricians; buildings and works departments; housing and hostels for workers; canteens; laundries and medical centres.\n\nThe UK's ROFs were set up and operated as production factories. The design of explosives, propellants and munitions was carried out at separate government-owned research and development establishments such as the Research Department, which was initially based at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich and then Fort Halstead, in Sevenoaks, Kent; and at PERME Waltham Abbey, Essex, which later moved to become RARDE Fort Halstead.\n\nA number of the ROFs were designated \"temporary\", for use during the war's duration only. They closed shortly after the end of the Second World War. Other ROFs were designated \"permanent\" and they remained open into more recent times. In 1957, a Defence White paper led to a reorganisation of the aircraft industry, a restructuring of the British Army and a concentration on missile systems. A number of the \"permanent\" ROFs closed in the late 1950s, after the end of the Korean War, and others closed in the 1970s. The largest of these, based at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, formally closed on 31 March 1967.\n\nThe temporary ROFs, or ROFs which closed in the 1950s and 1970s, tended to be taken over by other government departments. Some closed ROFs and Admiralty explosive sites, such as the Royal Navy Propellant Factory, Caerwent, were retained by the Ministry of Defence as ammunition storage areas; others became government industrial estates or trading estates; others were used as brownfield sites to build prisons or open prisons.\n\nPart of ROF Thorp Arch became the Boston Spa depository of the British Library. Three of the seven hostels that served ROF Swynnerton became a training school for General Post Office (GPO) Telephones, which later became British Telecom, and is now the Yarnfield Park Training and Conference Centre and run by Accenture. ROF Elstow was taken over by the CEGB and became a storage depot. The site has been cleared; and, as of 2008, is in the process of becoming the new town of Wixams.\n\nIn July 1974, the Royal Ordnance Factories were set up as a trading fund, under the Government Trading Funds Act 1973.\n\nAs part of its privatisation process in the 1980s, the UK Government transferred some of the, formerly separate, research and development capability of the Defence Research Establishments into the ROFs. Other parts of the UK's defence research and design capability were later closed down; remained with the UK Ministry of Defence, as Dstl; or became part of QinetiQ.\n\nOn 2 January 1985 the majority of the Royal Ordnance Factories were vested in the UK government-owned company Royal Ordnance plc; it was bought by British Aerospace in 1987. The Ministry of Defence Police left most of the ROFs on or within a few years of privatisation.\n\nThe small number of ROFs involved in nuclear weapons production, ROF Burghfield and ROF Cardiff, were removed from ROF management and did not pass over to Royal Ordnance upon privatisation. They were transferred to the control of AWRE; which later became the Atomic Weapons Establishment.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2213576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213576", "title": "Chuck McKinley", "text": "Chuck McKinley\n\nCharles Robert McKinley Jr. (January 5, 1941 – August 11, 1986) was an American former world no. 1 men's amateur tennis champion of the 1960s. He is remembered as an undersized, hard-working dynamo, whose relentless effort and competitive spirit led American tennis to the top of the sport during a period heavily dominated by Australians.\n\nMcKinley won the 1963 Men's Singles Championship at Wimbledon, and as a result was ranked World No. 1 by some journalists. He paired with Dennis Ralston to win the 1963 Davis Cup, the only interruption in eight unbroken years of Australian dominance. He also paired with Ralston to win the U.S. Men's Doubles championships in 1961, 1963, and 1964.\n\nMcKinley was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of a local pipe fitter, and grew up in a 'rough neighborhood' on the north side of town. As a boy, McKinley used to drop by the local YMCA where he was taught table tennis by volunteer instructor Bill Price. Eventually Price, who was also a tennis professional, took McKinley and some of the other boys to the public tennis courts. McKinley soon became so good that Price advised him to quit all other sports and concentrate on tennis.\n\nIn 1960 McKinley enrolled at Trinity University where he joined Frank Froehling, another leading American player, under the tutelage of coach Clarence Mabry, who also coached John Newcombe and other professionals. This gave Trinity arguably the best collegiate men's tennis team in the U.S. However, during this period Trinity never won the NCAA championship because the NCAA scheduled the championship tournament opposite Wimbledon, and both McKinley and Froehling chose to participate in Wimbledon rather than the collegiate tournament.\n\nMcKinley's decision to play Wimbledon was justified when in 1961, as a college sophomore, he reached the Wimbledon singles finals in which he was defeated by Rod Laver in straight sets. The same year, he won the singles title at the Eastern Grass Court Championships in South Orange against Frank Froehling. He won the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships in 1962 and 1963, defeating Fred Stolle and Dennis Ralston in the respective finals. In 1962 and 1964, McKinly was victorious in the singles event at the U.S. National Indoor Championships.\n\nHis intense desire to win, his habit of screaming, \"Oh Charley, you missed that one,\" at himself after a bad shot, and the fact that he drew a four-month suspension for heaving his tennis racket into the crowd at a Davis Cup match, gave him the reputation of the 'bad boy of international tennis.'\n\nIn 1963, with Laver in the professional ranks, McKinley won Wimbledon without losing a set. He was helped in this by the fact that favorite Roy Emerson was eliminated by little known German Wilhelm Bungert. After McKinley eliminated Bungert, the press asked the German if he had been tired. “I was tired,” said Bungert, \"Tired from those five set matches earlier. And tired from watching McKinley run.\" According to \"Time\", McKinley played the tournament \"with an astounding lack of grace. He leaps, he lunges, he scrambles, he slides, he falls, he dives, he skins his elbows and knees, and he flails at the ball as if he were clubbing a rat. His nerves are as taut as the strings of his racket.\" In the final, McKinley met Fred Stolle who had beaten McKinley four out of six previous meetings. However, Stolle said \"He knocked it down my throat...In the end, I didn't know where to serve or what he was going to do.\"\n\nIn December 1963, McKinley and Dennis Ralston played all of the matches for the U.S. in winning the Davis Cup from Australia. The Australians had not lost the cup for four years and did not relinquish it again for another four. In the decisive match, McKinley defeated John Newcombe.\n\nAfter graduation from Trinity, McKinley chose not to go into professional tennis, and he became a stockbroker in New York City. He died in 1986 in Dallas, Texas of a brain tumor at the age of 45. McKinley has been elected to the Trinity University Hall of Fame and to the International Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\nThe tennis courts at Pattonville High School in Maryland Heights, Missouri, the school he attended, are named after him.\n\nMcKinley was small for a tennis player, and as a grown man, he stood 5' 8” and weighed 160 pounds. McKinley did not use off speed shots but relied instead on a power game. According to a \"Sports Illustrated\", “Not in years has an American fledgling combined so much box-office appeal with so much pure ability – or crashed the tight little world of big-time tennis with so much confidence. 'If I didn't think I could be the best tennis player in the world,' Chuck McKinley says, 'I don't think I'd want to play.'\" Bill Talbert described the young McKinley by saying, \"There is nothing he can't do on the court. He has all the strokes. He's fast. He's strong. He has marvelous reflexes. He has the eyes of a hawk—sees the ball as well as anyone in the game.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2213594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213594", "title": "Pinega (river)", "text": "Pinega (river)\n\nThe Pinega () is a river in Verkhnetoyemsky, Pinezhsky, and Kholmogorsky Districts of Arkhangelsk Oblast in Russia. It is a right tributary of the Northern Dvina. It is long, and the area of its basin . Its main tributaries are the Ilesha, the Vyya, the Yula, the Pokshenga, and the Yozhuga.\n\nThe Pinega is the main waterway of the Pinezhsky District, with many of the settlements in the district located on the river banks. The river basin includes the north-western part of the Krasnoborsky District, the eastern part of the Verkhnetoyemsky District, the eastern part of the Vinogradovsky District, the major part of the Pinezhsky District, the eastern part of the Kholmogorsky District, and minor areas in the Leshukonsky District and in the Udorsky District of the Komi Republic. The Pinega flows in the hilly landscape, on the western border of the Timan Ridge, in the coniferous forest (taiga). It freezes up in mid October or early November and stays under the ice until mid April or early May.\n\nThe etymology of the name Pinega is unclear.\n\nThe Pinega starts in Verkhnetoyemsky District, close to the border with Krasnoborsky District, at the confluence of the Belaya River and the Chyornaya River. There it flows to the north-west, then turns north. The first village on the Pinega is Belorechensky, still in Verkhnetoyemsky District. North of Belorechensky, the river meanders, and after accepting the Okhtoma River from the left, turns east. From this point downstream, the valley of the Pinega is populated, and the villages are grouped by several into mini-agglomerations. The Pinega accepts the Ilesha from the south and turns north again, emerging as a broad river with high banks. Further downstream it accepts the Vyya from the west, in the village of Ust-Vyyskaya, and after accepting the Nyukhcha from the right, in the village of Zanyukhcha, turns north-west. From this point on, the unpaved road appears from the Komi Republik, and follows the right bank of the river. Downstream from Zanyukhcha, the Pinega passes historical selos of Sura and Verkola, accepts the Yula from the west, and passes the selo of Kevrola, which was the historical center of the area before the 19th century, on the left bank, and the selo of Karpogory, which is the current administrative center of the Pinezhsky District, on the right bank. Several kilometers downstream from Karpogory, the Pinega accepts the Pokshenga and turns north. In the village of Shilega, there is a railway bridge on the railroad connecting Arkhangelsk and Karpogory.\n\nDownstream from the mouth of the Yezhuga the Pinega suddenly turns west, and in the settlement of Pinega, which served as the administrative center of the area, turns south-west. On the right-hand bank Pinezhsky Nature Reserve has been established. Further downstream, the Pinega crosses into the Kholmogorsky District. Its mouth is in the historical settlement of Ust-Pinega.\n\nThe river is navigable upstream to from its mouth; downstream from the village of Gorka, however, there is no passenger navigation. At one point, several kilometers upstream from the settlement of Pinega, the river comes within a distance of several kilometers to the course of the Kuloy. In this place, the Kuloy-Pinega Canal was constructed in 1926–28, however, currently the canal is pretty much neglected.\n\nThe area was originally populated by Finno-Ugric peoples and then colonized by the Novgorod Republic. In the 13th century the Novgorod merchants already reached the White Sea. The Pinega was used by Novgorod merchants as the source of fur and also as the trading route to the basin of the Pechora River. \nFrom the Northern Dvina, there were a number of ways into the basin of the Mezen (from where the merchants could get to the basin of the Pechora and the Ob). Two options included going upstream the Pinega and taking the boats by land to the Kuloy and to the Mezen, or using the Pukshenga and the Pokshenga to get to the Pinega, and then from the Yozhuga taking boats by land to the Zyryanskaya Yezhuga and the Vashka.\n"}
{"id": "2213596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213596", "title": "Braye Harbour", "text": "Braye Harbour\n\nBraye Harbour (also known as Alderney Harbour) is the main harbour on the north side of the Island of Alderney, in the Channel Islands, a dependency of the British Crown. A break-water was built by the Admiralty to protect the Navy in the 19th century shelters Braye Harbour. It is an artificial harbour created by building a pier or jetty. The harbour faces out onto the Swinge, which is part of the English Channel. It is here that most of the island's freight comes in. It is more or less a suburb of St Anne, which is a large settlement in Alderney that juts out on a rocky promontory on the west side, approximately 1 mile from the harbour.\n\nThe harbour precinct contains harbour facilities, a knitwear factory, a sailing club, toilets, and several places offering food and drink.\n\nThe original main harbour at Longis Bay was built in 1736 by Henry Le Mesurier, Governor of Alderney, at his own cost. The old harbour was not safe even for ships of 40 to 60 tons capacity, as the current entering the bay during storms endangered the beams of the ship that supported the deck. In 1807, twenty ships moored at this harbour were lost or damaged and the stone protection works were swept away by the sea. Building a new harbour became inescapable, as it was felt that the bay would provide a \"safe and capacious harbour\" for use by on line ships. Trade and commerce first developed with building of a jetty at Braye Harbour.\n\nBetween 1847 and 1864 a massive breakwater was constructed.\n\nDuring the second world war the Germans put a boom across the harbour and incorporated a Rescue buoy into the boom.\n\nThe western side of Braye Bay has been extended towards the east with a pier, which has created this sheltered artificial harbour. The best time to enter the harbour is during rising tide, as it dries when at low water . In 1859, when the artificial harbour was built, lighting facilities to guide the ships through the entry channel or \"fairway channel\" were also fixed, as directed by the Hydrographic Office. Lights were fixed at two levels. Two red leading lights were installed at the head of the harbour; one was fixed on a parapet wall at a height of above high water tide level and the other, an upper light, was placed on the north-east corner, placed at height above the maximum tide condition, about from the lower light location. Navigation guidelines were also prescribed for entry into the harbour, guided by the two lights. At present, there are five harbour Fairway buoys. These are QG and QR at its outer end, and Q(2)G 5sec towards the centre, and QG (3) 5sec and QR (3) 5sec on approach to Little Crabby Harbour. 2FR (vert) lights mark the Commercial Quay end. FG and FR lights mark entrance to Little Crabby Harbour.\n\nIn the 19th century, according to the Admiralty charts of Braye Harbour, the depth of water was three fathoms at a distance of from the inner face of the western pier. It was also noted that from this pier, the four fathom depth line was at 400 ft from the eastern pier. Considering this situation, at that time, it was considered unsafe to moor ships of the Royal Navy here.\n\nThe anchorage is in the middle of the bay where there is firm ground of sand. However, rocky bed is also encountered, more so at the entrance to the harbour. Anchor lines are used in shoal areas when the tidal range in the spring season of up to permits such a use. Special permission is essential for anchoring near the Braye jetty or even tying to the jetty. The speed of boats or ships approaching the harbour is limited to 4 knots.\n\nOther safety precautions prescribed relate to watching the approach conditions from the Swinge or the Race ends of the harbour as the tidal conditions at these locations are in the range of 9 knots and 11 knots respectively. The most preferred option is to negotiate these two approaches during low tide conditions. All moorings are essentially on buoys, within the protection of the breakwater. Since there is no slipway, it would be necessary to use \"dingy to get ashore to where there is a public pontoon system especially for dingy tenders\".\n\nEven though there are a number of other anchorage locations in the Alderney at Saye Bay, Longis Bay, Telegraph Bay, Hannaine of Fort Clonque, and Burhou – the Lug, SW end of Burhou (these are not preferred as compared to Braye Barbour) where conditions are favourable only in calm weather and/or offshore winds conditions.\n\nDaily Tidal Charts with times and heights of high and low waters have been published for the harbour by the States of Alderney Harbour Authority and their agents.\n\nFor customs clearance and entry to the Island, Braye is the designated port of entry and it is compulsory for all vessels entering from outside the Bailiwick to clear customs formalities at this harbour. The commercial quay here is being developed now. Following these developments, two large container vessels berthed simultaneously at Alderney. The first largest vessel to be berthed here recently was the Huelin Dispatch.\n\nThe breakwater at Braye Harbour was built by the British to protect ships of the Navy between 1847 and 1864. Originally, two arms were planned as a protection to the harbour from the tidal race of The Swinge, but only the western arm was completed due to improving relations with the French. When construction stopped the breakwater was long, but within a year was abandoned to the sea following heavy gales. It gives only partial protection to the harbour, as during storms the breakwater suffers damage and is constantly repaired and maintained. Financial assistance for maintenance was provided by the UK until the 1980s, and since then by Guernsey in lieu of defense payments required to maintain The Bailiwick of Guernsey's status as a British Crown Dependency. The massive stone breakwater is generally used as a walk way to enjoy the scenic beauty of the bay, its harbour and the sea. The breakwater is now termed as \"Victorian\" and it provides safety to yachtsmen who sail in the harbour.\n\nFacilities available at the harbour are of the Harbour Master and Coastguard from its Harbour Master’s Office located at the SW end of the harbour and weather forecasts. The harbour has 70 yellow visitors’ mooring buoys to be used during good weather conditions; howsoever other mooring buoys here can be used only with prior permission. The nearest Railway Station is by the crossroads at the end of Braye Street, where a post box is also available.\n\nBraye Harbour has a slipway but it doesn't have a marina (yet) and there are no alongside pontoon systems to berth to. There are plans to develop the marina. A 300-berth marina is expected to be built from spring 2011.\n\nThe main Channel Islands have their own Merchant Shipping Legislation. Hence, all charter angling and diving vessels that visit Braye Harbour should abide by it. The Harbour Authority acts as the Maritime Authority.\n\n"}

He was the brother of Edward Tennant, 1st Baron Glenconner and Margot Asquith (and hence the brother-in-law of H. H. Asquith) and the half-brother of Baroness Elliot of Harwood. He was educated at Eton and at Trinity College, Cambridge.\n\nTennant was Assistant Private Secretary to his brother-in-law H. H. Asquith while the latter was Home Secretary between 1892 and 1895. In 1894 he was elected Member of Parliament for Berwickshire. Asquith became Prime Minister in 1908 and in January 1909 he appointed Tennant Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade. Tennant remained in this office until 1911, and then served under Asquith as Financial Secretary to the War Office from 1911 to 1912 and as Under-Secretary of State for War from 1912 to 1916. In 1914 he was sworn of the Privy Council. He entered the cabinet as Secretary for Scotland under Asquith in July 1916, a post he held until Asquith was ousted as Prime Minister in December 1916. Tennant did not serve under David Lloyd George.\n\nAt the 1918 general election, the Berwickshire constituency was abolished, and Tennant contested the new Berwickshire and Haddingtonshire constituency. He faced two opponents: R. W. Foulis of the Labour Party, and the 1911–1918 Haddingtonshire MP John Deans Hope. With two incumbent Liberal MPs contesting one seat, Hope's receipt of the coalition coupon secured his victory, with 54% of the votes. Tennant came a poor third, with only 16% of the votes.\n\nHe also unsuccessfully contested Glasgow Central in 1923 but never returned to the House of Commons.\n\nDuring his time in Parliament, Tennant supported a number of progressive measures such as worker's compensation, minimum wage provisions, school medical inspections, factory inspections, and unemployment insurance.\n\nHe married factory inspector May Abraham in 1896. Tennant bought Great Maytham Hall, Rolvenden, Kent in 1910. He commissioned Edwin Lutyens to rebuild the hall at a cost of £24,000.

At the time of his death, he was one of the world's wealthiest men, with a personal fortune estimated in 1940 to be worth US$400 million, equivalent to $7 billion at 2018 prices. He was the second-wealthiest Indian, after Mir Osman Ali Khan, Nizam of Hyderabad.\n\nHe was a philosopher-king, who was seen by Paul Brunton as living the ideal expressed in Plato's Republic. He has been compared to Emperor Ashoka by the English statesman Lord Samuel. Acknowledging Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV's noble and efficient kingship, Lord John Sankey declared in 1930 at the Round Table Conference in London, \"Mysore is the best administered state in the world\".\n\nThe vernacular name Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar comes from the word \"nalwadi\" meaning \"the fourth\" in Kannada.\n\nKrishnaraja Wadiyar IV was born on 4 June 1884 in Mysore Palace. He was the eldest son of Maharaja Chamarajendra Wadiyar X and Maharani Vani Vilas Sannidhana. After the death of his father in Calcutta in 1894, Krishnaraja Wadiyar's mother ruled the state as regent until Krishnaraja Wadiyar reached the age of majority on 8 August 1902.\n\nThe maharaja had his early education and training at the Lokaranjan Palace under the direction of P. Raghavendra Rao. In addition to Western studies, he was instructed in the languages of Kannada and Sanskrit, and was taught horse riding and Indian and western Classical music. His early administrative training was imparted by Sir Stuart Fraser of the Bombay Civil Service. The study of the principles of jurisprudence and methods of revenue administration was supplemented by extensive tours of the state during which he gained extensive knowledge of the nature of the country which he was later to govern.\n\nOn 6 June 1900, he married Maharani Pratapa Kumari Ammani of Kathiawar (b. 1889), the youngest daughter of Rana Sri Bane Sinhji Sahib, Rana Sahib of Vana in the Kathiawar region of the present-day Gujarat State.\n\nShortly after the death of his father Maharaja Chamarajendra Wadiyar X on 28 December 1894, Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, still a boy of eleven, ascended the throne on 1 February 1895. His mother Maharani Kemparajammanni ruled as regent until Krishnaraja Wodeyar took over on 8 February 1902. Krishna IV was invested as the Maharaja of Mysore, with full ruling powers, by Viceroy Lord Curzon on 8 August 1902 at a ceremony at Jaganmohana Palace.\n\nKrishnaraja Wodeyar set up educational infrastructure. The king was an accomplished musician, and like his predecessors, patronised fine arts. For these reasons, his reign is often described as the 'Golden age of Mysore'.\n\nKrishna Raja Wadiyar was the first chancellor of Banaras Hindu University and the University of Mysore. The latter was the first university chartered by an Indian State. \nThe Indian Institute of Science at Bangalore, which was initiated during his mother's tenure as regent, was functionally started during his reign, with the gift, in 1911, of 371 acres (1.5 km²) of land and a donation of funds. He was a patron of Indian, both Carnatic and Hindustani, and Western classical music.\n\nMysore had been the first Indian state to have a Representative Assembly, a democratic forum in 1881. During Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV's reign, the Assembly was enlarged and became bicameral in 1907 with the creation of the legislative council, a house of elders which introduced much new legislation for the state. During his reign, Mysore became the first Indian state to generate hydroelectric power in Asia, and Bangalore was the first Asian city to have street lights, first lit on 5 August 1905.\n\nDuring his 39-year reign as Maharaja, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV had the following \"diwans\" (prime ministers):\n\n\nDuring his reign, he worked toward alleviating poverty and improving rural reconstruction, public health, industry and economic regeneration, education and the fine arts. Such were the strides that Mysore made during his period that Gandhiji was moved to remark that the Maharaja was a \"Rajarishi\" (\"a saintly king\"). Paul Brunton, the British philosopher and orientalist; John Gunther, the American author; and the British statesman, Lord Samuel, were also among those who heaped praise on the king. Lord Sankey said during the Round table conference that Mysore was \"\"the best administered state in the world\"\". Princes from other sections of India were sent to Mysore for administrative training. The Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya described the Raja as \"Dharmic\" and Lord Wellington echoed the sentiment by calling Mysore's industrial development \"incredible\". In an obituary, \"The Times\" called him \"a ruling prince second to none in esteem and affection inspired by both his impressive administration and his attractive personality\".\n\nThe Raja was a connoisseur of Carnatic and Hindustani music. He played eight musical instruments: flute, violin, saxophone, piano, mridangam, nadaswara, sitar, and veena.

To the east, Cape Drapanon rises above the plain and extends out into the Sea of Crete. The area is very green and fertile, unusual for rocky Crete. The Kiliaris river, known in antiquity as 'Pyknos', runs through the region. Robert Pashley suggested that the name 'Apokoronas' came from the ancient city of Ippokoronas or Ippokoronion, also cited by Strabo. This city may have been located near modern Nipos, or on the site of the Venetian fortress, Castel Apicorono, on an outcrop between Kalyves and Almyrida. The major towns of Apokoronas are Vamos, Armenoi and Vryses, with police, municipal and utility offices as well as taverns and large churches; Kalyves, Almyrida and Georgioupoli are the largest beach resorts. Tourism and agriculture are the major local industries, with much construction and quarrying to satisfy the demands of many foreigners eager to buy or rent properties in what used to be beautiful and traditional villages. Gavalohori is among the more popular villages for foreign buyers, with a large amount of often low-quality building taking place.

The league was formed to oppose the Hittites. A successor state, in a similar area, was named Arzawa. The historian H. T. Bossert suggested that \"Assuwa\" may have been the origin of the name Asia (which was used initially only in reference to Asia Minor).\n\nModern scholars have often located Assuwa only in the north-west corner of Anatolia, an area centred north or north-west of the future Arzawa. This has made the inclusion of Caria, \"Lukka\" and/or Lycia problematic, as they were clearly located in south-west Anatolia. Their inclusion would mean that Assuwa included areas both north and south of Arzawa. However, the confederative structure of Assuwa may well have included states in two or more geographically separate, non-contiguous areas, which lacked a common land border.\n\nThe member states are said to have included (in the order that they were listed by Tudhaliya I):\n\n\nIn most cases, these states are never (or seldom) mentioned in the few contemporaneous sources available. However, \"Karkiya\" has generally been identified with Caria, \"Taruisa\" with the Troas (Troad) peninsula, and \"Wilusiya\" with Wilusa – which was apparently the endonym of the city known to the Ancient Greeks as Troy (or Ilios). The historical Lycia and/or \"Lukka\" have frequently been identified with \"Warsiya\" and \"[L]ugga\". For instance, in the \"Iliad\", Homer refers to two separate areas as \"Lycia\": Sarpedon is a leader of \"distant Lycia\" (in \"2.876-77, 5.479\") and Pandarus is the leader of Lycians from around Mount Ida (\"2.824ff. 5.105\"). Likewise the Alaksandu Treaty identifies \"Warsiyalla\" with the \"Lukka\".\n\nThe confederacy is mentioned only in the fragmentary tablets making up Laroche's CTH 142/85. Since Tudhaliya IV was known to have had frontier trouble between 1250 and 1200 BC, and since the text lists rebel nations in much the way Ramesses II does, the first consensus dated this text and, therefore, Assuwa to Tudhaliya IV. This dating appears in all older literature on the fall of the Hatti, and crops up every now and then to this day. However the consensus has since then come around to dating Assuwa to an earlier Tudhaliya, which means prior to Suppiluliuma and so prior to 1350 BC.\n\nA number of fragmentary Hittite records imply that the anti-Hittite rebellion of the Assuwa league received a certain degree of support from Mycenaean Greece (Ahhiyawa in Hittite). The \"Iliad\"s depiction of Ajax the Great’s military equipment, Heracles sacking Troy prior to the Trojan War and Bellerophon’s deeds in Anatolia may have been inspired by Mycenaean warriors who participated in this rebellion.\n\n"}

There are slight yet inconclusive hints that it may be a corruptive influence of some kind (at least to Cloak, possibly to Darkhawk as well), perhaps even a sentient entity and the opposite of the Lightforce. At least one darkforce user (Quagmire) is from the parallel universe of the Squadron Supreme instead of the main Marvel Universe.\n\nThe Darkforce's origin along with the Lightforce is unknown. Some stories suggest that it is actually matter from a parallel universe that may be accessed by mystical means. Its first appearance was in August 1976's \"Champions\" #7, where it was shown as the source of Darkstar's powers of solid energy projection and flight.\n\nOver the years, the Darkforce gradually became more and more of a presence among superpowered beings of the Marvel Universe. Moonstone (Karla Sofen) speculated in \"Avengers\" #238 that it could be related to the powers of the Shroud and the first Blackout. A later storyline revealed that, at the very least, it is possible to escape Blackout's energy traps by means of the Shroud's cape, as shown when Captain Marvel was trapped there by Blackout and emerged from the Shroud's cape during the Masters of Evil's attack on Avengers Mansion. \"New Warriors\" #31-33 and other storylines later expanded the number of Darkforce users even more.\n\nSometimes the effects of Darkforce are subtle to the point of being cosmetic. For instance, it had been deduced that both X-Men member Nightcrawler and X-Men foe Vanisher use the Darkforce Dimension during their teleportation (as revealed in \"Bizarre Adventures\" #27). However, in the Draco storyline of \"Uncanny X-Men\", it was explained that Nightcrawler's power stems from another dimension (nicknamed the \"Brimstone Dimension\"). If this dimension bears any connection to Darkforce, it has yet to be revealed.\n\nDuring the \"Secret Empire\" storyline, Baron Helmut Zemo used the Darkhold to enhance a brainwashed Blackout's abilities enough to trap Manhattan in the Darkforce Dimension.

It was founded in 1963 by the Sisters of Divine Providence as a Roman Catholic college and now sits on an campus in McCandless within the Diocese of Pittsburgh.\n\nLa Roche University was founded in 1963 by the Sisters of Divine Providence as a private college for religious sisters. It was named in honor of Stephanie Amelia la Roche von Starkenfels, the first Mother Superior of the Sisters of Divine Providence. The first president of the university was Sister Annunciata Sohl, C.D.P., who served until 1968. The college had begun to admit its first lay students by 1965. It continued to grow, and two years later, La Roche expanded beyond its leased space to construct the first building, the John J. Wright Library.\n\nLa Roche encountered financial difficulties soon after its founding. Although closing the college was considered, Sister de la Salle Mahler, C.D.P., president from 1969 to 1975, carried on. The Board amended its charter in 1970 to establish La Roche as an independent, coeducational Catholic institution, while also diversifying course offerings through an affiliation with the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. This partnership made available several new areas of study, including graphic and interior design, which count among the University's strongest programs today.\n\nAn enrollment boom made the construction of two new residence halls necessary in the mid-1970s. Under College President Sister Mary Joan Coultas, C.D.P. (1975–80), the College launched its first capital campaign in 1979, garnering enough to construct the Palumbo Science Center, which opened in 1980. During Divine Providence Sister Margaret Huber's eleven-year tenure as president beginning in 1981, the college continued to grow, marking its 25th anniversary in 1987 with the dedication of the $2.5 million-Zappala College Center. The Magdalen Chapel was added in 1990, and in 1993 the college opened the Kerr Fitness and Sports Center.\n\nLa Roche's sixth president, Monsignor William A. Kerr, was appointed in 1992 and focused his leadership on raising the College's visibility, while broadening academic, cultural and athletic programs. In 2004, the La Roche College Board of Trustees elected the College's seventh president, Sister Candace Introcaso, C.D.P.\n\nLa Roche University teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division III. The Redhawks are a member of the Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference (AMCC). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse and soccer; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball. La Roche University has won sixteen AMCC Conference Championships including Baseball (2012, 2014, 2015, 2016), Men's Basketball (2004, 2011), Softball (2000, 2001, 2002), Women's Basketball (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016), and Women's Tennis (2012). The La Roche University Baseball team also became the first team in AMCC Conference history to win an NCAA Regional Championship after defeating Randolph Macon 4-3 in the NCAA Mideast Regional Championship on May 21, 2016. La Roche advanced to the NCAA Division III College World Series before falling to Keystone 5-4 in the National Semifinals. .The head coach for women's basketball is Kamela Gissendanner, one of the most successful coaches in the country.\n\nThe John J. Wright Library was the first building constructed for the university, built in 1967 and renovated in the early 2000s. Two residence halls were built in the mid-1970s, and the university opened the Palumbo Science Center in 1980. The 1,200-seat Kerr Fitness & Sports Center opened in 1993 and has been updated throughout the years. Current athletic facilities include a baseball field, soccer field, softball field, aerobics room, dance studio, gymnasium, indoor track and a weight room. Tennis courts of any sort, and outdoor basketball courts, have both yet to be added to the campus. Residence halls were added and expanded upon in 1997 and 2003 with the dedication of Bold Hall and Bold Hall II. A classroom building introducing electronic classroom technology was added adjacent to the Zappala College Center in 2002.\n\nBeginning in 1993, the Pacem In Terris Institute has brought students from conflict, post-conflict and developing regions of the world to study at La Roche. The program provides scholarships and assistance, to students from 21 different countries. The students are chosen by their countries on the basis of academic and personal potential, and promise to return to their homelands upon completion of their studies to work for peace and prosperity in their regions.\n\nNotable members on the Board of the Institute are Kim Dae-jung, past president of the Republic of Korea; Queen Rania Al-Abdullah, first lady of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan; and Janet Museveni, first lady of the Republic of Uganda.\n\n"}

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Volos, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 25.227 km. It lies on the Pelion peninsula about 7 km from Volos.\n\nThere are some different opinions about the town's name. Some believe that the name comes from wild olive trees (Agrielies) (Αγριελιές), or a small plant named \"Agriada\" (). A scholar named Patroklos Palamidas from the nearby village of Lechonia said that the name originated from an ancient temple, which existed in the region and was dedicated to Agrea Dimitra ().\n\nDuring the Turkish occupation in Agria there were few settlements such as a hostel for caravans and a toll station. However, houses were built in the early 19th century, before the Revolution of 1821. It is relatively new town (the community was established in 1912). The area formerly belonged to the villages of Drakia and Agios Laurentios, a port from which these and other villages distributed agricultural and craft products.\n\nFrom 1809 - 1860 companies were created that exported local crafts and copper to Western Europe, Romania, and Russia.\n\nAgria started to grow rapidly after the annexation of Thessaly from the Turks, and with the construction of a coastal road and rail network during 1895 that connected Volos to the southwestern villages of Pelion, which exported sea fruit, oil, and black olives from the bay.\n\nIn 1911 the international cement plant A.G.E.T HERCULES () was founded there. The plant occupies a natural harbor and is among the largest cement producers in Europe, Asia, and America.\n\nIn 1920 an English commercial paper stated that Agria was «the largest port in the world» with reference to their exports of olives and oil. Around two hundred thousand kilos (200 tons) of table olives are exported annually from Agria.\n\nA new wave of residents moved to Agria in 1922 when refugees from Asia Minor, mainly Eastern Thrace, took shelter there after their expulsion from their home land.\n\n20th century Agria saw population and industrial growth. The famous EPSA () founded in 1924 by the Kosmadopoulos brothers, who owned a bank, built a refrigerated fruit and ice plant. The overproduction of lemons in the already developed movement of traditional lemonade from Asia Minor sellers, leading owners to recruit a German engineer for running drink bottling plant. The legend is the German engineer has discovered a rare recipe for the production of lemonade, recipe still used today is unchanged and the company's stock.\nOther local businesses were founded and flourished then as the factories of packaging and trade of olives, the wood processing industry which was originally craft construction barrels and the modernization of the industry turned to woodworking and furniture at the same time. Other smaller companies also mostly oil warehouses - have begun to operate and attract people to Agria.\n\nFrom June 1941 until September 1943 the village was base for the Italian occupation forces. From October 1943 until September 1944 Agria was the home and base for operations of a company of the 4th Polizei Waffen SS field engineers, the 16th Coy SS Pz. Gren. Rgt 8. The commanders building still exists. It is a neoclassical house located at the center of Agria next to the church of Saint George (Agios Georgios).\n\nIn the summer months it becomes a popular tourist destination. The large beach at Agria and at nearby Soutrali beach are good for swimming. The chapels of Timios Stavros, Panaghia Goritsa and Panaghia Tripa, built within the rocks, are remarkable for their beauty and simplicity. At the end of July exhibitions of popular art and local dances take place. Also in the middle of summer when there is a new moon there is a celebration in honor of the fishermen \"(psaradiki vradia)\" where fresh kakavia (traditional fish soup) is served. The area used to have many olive groves which, unfortunately enough, have now mainly been replaced by modern buildings.\n\n\n"}

The highway starts in rural Morrow County in Eastern Oregon at an interchange with Interstate 84 (I-84) and US 30, located east of the city of Boardman. US 730 travels east along the Columbia River as a continuation of Columbia River Highway No. 2 into Umatilla County, intersecting I-82 and US 395 in the city of Umatilla. US 730 and US 395 form a short concurrency within the city before the highways part, with US 730 continuing northeast into Washington. The highway travels through rural Walla Walla County and ends at an intersection with US 12 south of Wallula.\n\nUS 730 was created with the original United States Highways on November 11, 1926, traveling on the existing Columbia River Highway, established in 1917, from US 30 in Umatilla to US 410 south of Wallula. The Washington section of US 730 was added to the state highway system in 1923 as a branch of State Road 3, later becoming a branch of Primary State Highway 3 (PSH 3) in 1937. The highway was concurrent with US 395 from 1937 until 1985, traveling from Cold Springs Junction to US 410. US 30 was moved to a new route bypassing Umatilla and Irrigon in 1946, allowing for US 730 to be extended southwest to Boardman, later to an interchange with I-84.\n\nUS 730 runs in Oregon and Washington and is listed as part of the National Highway System, a system of roads crucial to the nation's economy, defense and mobility, from its western terminus at I-84 east of Boardman to the end of its concurrency with US 395 in Umatilla. As a state highway in both states, the roadway is maintained by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) and Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). US 730 has the highest designation of any United States Numbered Highway, or U.S. route, and is the shortest highway in the system. The highway is defined by the Washington State Legislature as SR 730, part of the Revised Code of Washington as §47.17.821.\n\nUS 730 begins at a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-84 and US 30 at Boardman Junction, located east of the city of Boardman in Morrow County. The highway, a continuation of Columbia River Highway No. 2, travels northeast across a Union Pacific rail line and passes the Umatilla National Wildlife Refuge on the Columbia River before reaching the city of Irrigon. From Irrigon, US 730 continues northeast along the Columbia River into Umatilla County and becomes 6th Street in the city of Umatilla. The highway intersects I-82 and US 395 in a diamond interchange and forms a short concurrency with US 395. US 730 continues east through the unincorporated community of McNary and the northern terminus of Oregon Route 207 (OR 207) in rural Umatilla County. The highway turns northeastward along Lake Wallula and intersects OR 37 at Cold Springs Junction, providing connections north to the Warehouse Beach Recreation Area and Hat Rock State Park on the Columbia River and south to the city of Pendleton. US 730 heads into Washington, traveling between a Union Pacific rail line and the canyon walls of the Columbia River Gorge. An ODOT survey measuring traffic volume for any average day of the year, expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), was conducted in 2011 on US 730 and calculated that the busiest section of the highway in Oregon was at its interchange with I-82, serving 11,800 vehicles, while the least busy section of the highway was at the Washington state line, serving 2,500 vehicles.\n\nUS 730 continues north from Oregon along Lake Wallula and around Clover Hill, reaching Wallula Junction in Walla Walla County. The highway intersects its spur route and turns east towards its eastern terminus at US 12 south of the community of Wallula. Every year, WSDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume, expressed in terms of AADT. In 2012, WSDOT calculated that the Washington section of US 730 served between 1,500 and 2,400 vehicles per day.\n\nThe highway that became US 730 within Oregon has been designated by the Oregon State Highway Commission as the easternmost segment of Columbia River Highway No. 2 since November 27, 1917, created as part of the initial named state highway system. The segment of US 730 within Washington was added to the state highway system in 1923 as a branch of State Road 3 and kept its designation as a branch of PSH 3 during the creation of the primary and secondary highway system in 1937. The United States Highway System was adopted on November 11, 1926, by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) and included US 730, traveling northeast along the Columbia River from US 30 in Umatilla to US 410 south of Wallula. The highway was originally planned to be numbered as US 420, but was changed after US 30 was substituted in place of US 20 along the Columbia River. US 395 was extended south from Spokane, Washington, to San Diego, California, in 1937, becoming concurrent with US 730 between Cold Springs Junction and its eastern terminus at US 410 south of Wallula. US 30 was moved to a new section of the Old Oregon Trail Highway No. 6, bypassing the cities of Irrigon and Umatilla, on November 25, 1946.\n\nUS 730 was subsequently extended west in 1962 to an intersection with US 30 at Boardman Junction, and was moved further south to an interchange with I-80N in 1967. During the westward extension of US 12 from Idaho into Washington, ODOT suggested to the AASHO a route that included the entirety of US 730 in 1962, while WSDOT suggested routing US 12 over US 410 and Washington State Route 12 (SR 12) to Vancouver, Washington. The AASHO approved the extension of US 12 into Washington on June 20, 1967, routing it along US 410 and SR 14 to its present terminus in Aberdeen. US 395 was re-aligned to a concurrency with I-82 in 1985, crossing the Columbia River on the Umatilla Bridge and having a shorter concurrency with US 730. The old route of US 395 from Cold Springs Junction to Pendleton, part of Pendleton-Cold Springs Highway No. 36, became Oregon Route 37.\n\nThe highway's eastern terminus in Wallula is planned to be moved further north to a new interchange with US 12 after the completion of the Burbank–Walla Walla divided highway in 2020.\n\nUS 730 has a spur route in rural Walla Walla County that connects it to US 12 westbound towards Wallula, while US 730 is directed towards eastbound US 12 towards the city of Walla Walla. WSDOT included the road in its annual AADT survey in 2012 and calculated that 1,300 vehicles used the spur route.\n\n\n"}

After Qaiqabad was paralyzed, a group of nobles appointed his infant son Shamsuddin Kayumars as the new Sultan, and tried to kill Jalal-ud-din. Instead, Jalal-ud-din had them killed, and became the regent. A few months later, he deposed Kayumars, and became the new Sultan.\n\nAs a Sultan, he repulsed a Mongol invasion, and allowed many Mongols to settle in India after their conversion to Islam. He captured Mandawar and Jhain from the Chahamana king Hammira, although he was unable to capture the Chahamana capital Ranthambore. During his reign, his nephew Ali Gurshasp raided Bhilsa in 1293 and Devagiri in 1296.\n\nJalal-ud-din, who was around 70 years old at the time of his ascension, was known as a mild-mannered, humble and kind monarch to the general public. During the first year of his reign, he ruled from Kilokhri to avoid confrontations with the old Turkic nobles of the imperial capital Delhi. Several nobles considered him as a weak ruler, and unsuccessfully attempted to overthrow him at different times. He meted out lenient punishments to the rebels, except in case of a dervish Sidi Maula, who was executed for allegedly conspiring to dethrone him. Jalal-ud-din was ultimately assassinated by his nephew Ali Gurshasp, who subsequently ascended the throne as Alauddin Khalji.\n\nJalal-ud-din was a Turk of the Khalaj tribe. His ancestors had migrated from Turkestan to present-day Afghanistan, where they had lived in Helmand and Laghman for over 200 years, intermarried with local Afghans, and adopted Afghan customs and manners. Because of this, when his family migrated to India, the Turkic nobles of Delhi considered them to be Afghans. They were treated as Afghans in the Delhi Court.\n\nBefore his ascension to the throne, Jalal-ud-din was known as Malik Firuz. He and his brother Shihabuddin ( father of Alauddin Khalji) served the Delhi Sultan Balban for several years. He rose to the position of \"sar-i-jandar\" (chief of the royal bodyguards), and was later appointed as the governor of the frontier province of Samana. As the governor of Samana, he distinguished himself in the Sultanate's conflicts with the Mongol invaders.\n\nAfter Balban's death in 1287, Delhi's kotwal Malik al-Umara Fakhruddin enthroned Balban's teenage grandson Muiz ud din Qaiqabad (or Kayqubad) with the title Muizzuddin. Qaiqabad was a weak ruler, and the administration was actually run by his officer Malik Nizamuddin. After Nizamuddin was poisoned by some rival officers, Qaiqabad summoned Jalal-ud-din from Samana to Delhi, gave him the title \"Shaista Khan\", appointed him as the \"ariz-i-mumalik\", and made him the governor of Baran.\n\nBy this time, Qaiqabad's health had deteriorated, and two rival factions of nobles vied for the power in Delhi. One faction, led by Malik Aytemur Surkha, sought to maintain the power of the old Turkic nobility, and wanted to retain Balban's family on the throne. The other faction, led by Jalal-ud-din, supported the rise of the new nobility.\n\nWhen Qaiqabad was incurably paralyzed, Malik Surkha and his associate Malik Kachhan appointed his infant son Kayumars (or Kayumarth) on the throne with the title Shamsuddin II. The two nobles then conspired to kill their rival nobles, including Jalal-ud-din (then Malik Firuz). At this time, Jalal-ud-din was conducting an inspection of the royal army at Bhugal Pahari (Baharpur according to Ziauddin Barani). His nephew Malik Ahmad Chap, who held the office of \"naib-i amir-i hajib\", informed him about the conspiracy. Jalal-ud-din then moved his quarters to Ghiyaspur, and summoned his relatives from Baran on the pretext of preparing for an impending Mongol invasion. Other officers on Surkha's hit list also joined the Khaljis.\n\nShortly after, Jalal-ud-din received an order summoning him to the royal court in Delhi, and realized that this was part of a plot to kill him. He excused himself on the pretext of conducting an inspection of the army at Kannauj. Kachhan then personally marched from Delhi to Kannauj, and told Jalal-ud-din that his presence was sought in Delhi immediately. Jalal-ud-din pretended not knowing anything about the conspiracy, and requested Kachhan to rest in a tent, while he finished the inspection. In the tent, Jalal-ud-din had Kachhan beheaded, and had his body thrown into the Yamuna River, starting a war between the two rival factions.\n\nJalal-ud-din's sons marched to Delhi, entered the royal palace, and brought the titular Sultan Kayumars to Jalal-ud-din's camp. Malik Surkha and his associates tried to retrieve Kayumars, but were captured and killed. Jalal-ud-din's men also abducted some sons of Malik al-Umara Fakhruddin, the kotwal of Delhi, and therefore, Fakhruddin dissuaded the people of Delhi from trying to retrieve Kayumars.\n\nAfter eliminating the officers of the rival faction, Jalal-ud-din continued to acknowledge Kayumars as the Sultan of Delhi. He became the governor of Bhatinda, Dipalpur and Multan provinces. Initially, he offered Kayumars' regency to Balban's nephew Malik Chajju and Fakhruddin. However, Malik Chajju preferred to be the governor of Kara-Manikpur, and Fakhruddin also rejected the offer. Therefore, Jalal-ud-din himself became the regent.\n\nQaiqabad died on 1 February 1290: according to Yahya Sirhindi he died of starvation after being neglected, but another account states that he was murdered on Jalal-ud-din's orders by an officer whose father had been executed by him. Kayumars' titular reign (1290) lasted for around 3 months, before he was deposed by Jalal-ud-din.\n\nJalal-ud-din (known as Malik Firuz until this point), ascended the throne of Delhi in June 1290, at the unfinished Kilokhri (also Kilughari or Kailugarhi) Palace near Delhi. At the time of his ascension, Jalal-ud-din was very unpopular. He had little support among the old Turkic nobles, who wrongly believed him to be of non-Turkic ancestry. In addition, he was an old man of around 70 years, and his mild nature was seen as unsuitable for the position. Because of his unpopularity, he decided not to move to Balban's palace at Delhi, and lived at Kilokhri for around one year. He finished the palace, and turned Kilokhri into an important town.\n\nJalal-ud-din avoided making any radical changes to the administrative set-up, and retained the old Turkic nobles in the offices that they held during Balban's reign. For example, Fakhruddin was retained as the \"kotwal\" of Delhi, Khwaja Khatir was retained as the \"wazir\", and Balban's nephew Malik Chajju was retained as the governor of Kara-Manikpur. The surviving members of Balban's royal family moved to Kara under Chajju's governship.\n\nAt the same time, Jalal-ud-din appointed his relatives and associates to the important offices. He appointed his brother Yaghrash Khan as the head of the army ministry (\"ariz-i-mamalik\"), and his nephew Ahmad Chap as \"naib-i barbek\". He gave his eldest son Mahmud the title Khan-i-Khan; the next two sons were given the titles Arkali Khan and Qadr Khan. He also appointed his nephews Ali Gurshasp (later Sultan Alauddin) and Almas Beg as \"Amir-i-Tuzuk\" (equivalent to Master of ceremonies) and \"Akhur-beg\" (equivalent to Master of the Horse) respectively.\n\nGradually, Jalal-ud-din overcame the initial hostility that he had faced from the citizens of Delhi. He gained reputation as a humble and kind-hearted monarch, as opposed to the preceding despots like Balban. After entering Delhi, he had the royal entrance to the Red Palace dismounted, and refused to sit on the king's seat in the royal audience-hall, saying that the crown had been forced upon him because of the malicious intents of Surkha and Kachhan.\n\nWhile the general public admired Jalal-ud-din as a kind-hearted and sincere person, a section of nobles despised him as a weak ruler. In August 1290, Balban's nephew Malik Chajju Kashli Khan, who now headed the former royal family, staged a revolt against Jalal-ud-din at Kara. Chajju seems to have opted for the governship of the easternmost province of Kara-Manikpur to remain away from imperial control, and possibly, because he hoped to seek support from his cousin Bughra Khan (father of Qaiqabad), who had become an independent ruler of the eastern Bengal region in 1287.\n\nChajju styled himself as Sultan Mughisuddin, and declared his independence. As a mark of his sovereignty, he issued his own coins, and had the \"khutba\" read in his name. Ali Hatim Khan, the governor of Awadh, as well as other older nobles appointed in the eastern region, supported him. Chajju was also supported by a number of Hindu chiefs of the Gangetic plains, who had not paid their tribute for some years, and who swore allegiance to Balban's family. Under these circumstances, Jalal-ud-din's loyal officers in the Ganga-Yamuna Doab region started withdrawing from the region.\n\nChajju was confident that he enjoyed more support than Jalal-ud-din, who was yet to find favour among the old nobles of Delhi and its neighbouring areas. Therefore, he marched towards Delhi along the left bank of the Ganges River, and then the Ramganga River. He probably planned to enter Delhi from Amroha area. At Badaun, his supporters Malik Bahadur and Alp Ghazi joined him with their troops.\n\nJalal-ud-din set out to crush the revolt after appointing his eldest son, who held the title \"Khan-i Khanan\", in-charge of Delhi. He led his army towards Badaun via Koil (modern Aligarh). The vanguard of his army, led by his second eldest son Arkali Khan, marched ahead of the rest of the army, and spotted Chajju's army on the other side of the Ramganga River. Chajju's soldiers had seized all the boats, so Arkali Khan's contingent could not cross the river. At night, Arkali Khan sent a raiding party to Chajju's camp on rafts and skiffs. The raids caused panic among Chajju's soldiers, who deserted their camp, and moved northwards. Arkali Khan plundered the deserted camp for two days, and then pursued the enemy. He came across Chajju's army at a Ramganga river crossing, and fought an indecisive battle. Meanwhile, Jalal-ud-din's army crossed the Ganges river at Bhojpur (near Farrukhabad), and engaged Chajju's supporters in another battle.\n\nAt night, an agent of Chajju's Hindu supporter Bhim Deva (Biram Deva Kotla according to \"Tarikh-i Mubarak Shahi\") informed him that Jalal-ud-din would attack his army from rear. Chajju then secretly left the camp with some of his followers. In the morning, Arkali Khan crossed the river, and easily defeated the remaining army of Chajju. Chajju's supporters Alp Ghazi and Bhim Deva were killed, while Malik Masud and Malik Muhammad Balban were captured. The rest of Chajju's army then surrendered. Chajju himself took shelter in a walled village, but the village headman turned him over to Jalal-ud-din's army.\n\nAakali Khan then joined Jalal-ud-din, and the combined imperial army marched to the eastern districts to punish the chiefs who had supported Chajju. Some chiefs, such as that of Rupal, surrendered and saved themselves by offering heavy tributes. Others, such as that of Kahsun, faced plundering raids. The Hindu rebels were executed, and the Muslim rebels of Indian origin were sold as slaves.\n\nJalal-ud-din treated the Turkic Muslim rebels kindly, despite objections by his nephew Ahmad Chhap. When the imprisoned rebel nobles were brought to his camp in chains, he disapproved of their mistreatment. He ordered them to be released, dressed well and entertained. He invited the high-ranking rebel nobles, such as Amir Ali Sarjandar, to a feast. Even Malik Chajju, who was captured a few days later, was sent to an honourable confinement at Multan instead of being executed; his associates were released. Jalal-ud-din openly praised the rebels for their loyalty to their deceased master Balban. When Ahmad Chhap objected to such leniency, Jalal-ud-din declared that he was incapable of being tyrannical, and argued that the pardoned nobles would be grateful to him and remain loyal to him.\n\nSometime after Chajju's revolt, the Mongols invaded the north-west frontier of the Delhi Sultanate. The invasion was led by Abdullah, who was a grandson of Hallu (Hulagu Khan) according to Ziauddin Barani, and a son of \"the prince of Khurasan\" according to Yahya's \"Tarikh-i Mubarak Shahi\".\n\nThe frontier provinces of Dipalpur, Multan, and Samana were governed by Jalal-ud-din's son Arkali Khan. Jalal-ud-din personally led an army to repulse the invaders. The two armies faced each other at a place named Bar-ram, and their vanguards engaged in some skirmishes. The skirmishes ended with advantage for the Delhi forces, and the Mongols agreed to retreat. Jalal-ud-din called Abdullah his son after exchanging friendly greetings.\n\nA group of Mongols, led by Ulghu (another grandson of Hulagu), decided to embrace Islam, and sought Jalal-ud-din's permission to settle in India. In the Delhi Sultanate, the Mongols were regarded as hardened criminals, who had been involved in murders and highway robbery. Despite this, Jalal-ud-din accepted their regrets, and allowed them to settle in the lower Ganges plain, on the Lakhnauti (Bengal) frontier of his kingdom. He also provided the new settlers with accommodation, allowances and social ranks. These Mongols came to be known as \"New Muslims\".\n\nThe Chahamana king Hammira-deva ruled a kingdom centred around Ranthambore, located to the south-west of Delhi. Hammira's expansionist policy had threatened the Ajmer and Haryana frontiers of the Delhi Sultanate, which prompted Jalal-ud-din to invade his kingdom.\n\nJalal-ud-din marched via Rewari and Narnaul to reach the Alwar frontier of Hammira's kingdom. He first besieged fortress of Mandawar (called \"Mandor\" by Ziauddin Barani and Yahya Sirhindi). Mandawar was once a part of the Delhi Sultanate, but had been lost to the Chahamanas in the preceding years; Jalal-ud-din recaptured it in 1292. After this victory, he raided the countryside, obtaining a large number of cattle.\n\nAccording to Yahya's \"Tarikh-i Mubarak Shahi\", the siege of Mandawar lasted for four months. However, historian A. B. M. Habibullah believes that this was the duration of the entire Ranthambore campaign, including the sieges of Mandawar, Jhain and Ranthambore.\n\nJalal-ud-din's eldest son, \"Khan-i Khanan\", died on the eve of the Mandawar campaign.\n\nIn 1291, Jalal-ud-din marched across the Karauli region to Jhain, a town that guarded the approaches to the Chahamana capital Ranthambore. A reconnaissance party of the Delhi army, led by Qara Bahadur, defeated a Chahamana contingent. Jalal-ud-din then sent a larger detachment to besiege the Jhain fort. When the invaders reached within two \"farsang\"s of the fort, a Chahamana army led by Gardan Saini came out of the fort and engaged them in a battle. The Delhi army emerged victorious, and Gardan Saini was killed in action. The invaders then pursued the retreating Chahamana soldiers across Chambal, Kunwari and Banas rivers. The remaining Chahamana contingents stationed at Jhain then evacuated the fort, and retreated to Ranthambore.\n\nFollowing this victory, the invaders engaged in plunder, and dismantled the Jhain fort. Jalal-ud-din, an iconoclast, broke the non-Islamic idols, although he admired their sculpture and carvings.\n\nThe \"Miftah al-Futuh\", written by his courtier Amir Khusrau, claims that thousands of defenders were killed in the siege of Jhain, while the Delhi army lost only one Turkic soldier.\n\nAfter conquering Jhain, Jalal-ud-din ordered his army to besiege the Ranthambore Fort, which was situated on a steep hill, and was reputed to be impregnable. He issued orders for the construction of siege engines such as \"maghrabis\" (catapults), \"sabats\", \"gargajes\", and a \"pasheb\" (mound to reach the hilltop). According to the Delhi chronicler Ziauddin Barani, he abandoned the siege when he came out to inspect the progress of the construction, and realized the ensuing siege would cost many Muslim lives. Barani states that Jalal-ud-din declared he would not risk the hair of a single Muslim for \"ten such forts\". Jalal-ud-din's nephew Ahmad Chap opposed this decision saying that it would embolden the Hindus, and asked him to emulate the earlier Muslim kings such as Mahmud and Sanjar, \"whose undoubted piety never limited their kingly action.\" But Jalal-ud-din argued that the comparisons to Mahmud and Sanjar were unfair, because their dominions did not include \"a single idolater\".\n\nSeveral of Jalal-ud-din's courtiers believed that he was a weak king, who could not inspire the necessary fear among his subjects and the enemies of the Sultanate. During the Ranthambore campaign, some of his closest associates met at the house of Malik Tajuddin Kuchi. In a drunken stupor, they talked about killing Jalal-ud-din and raising Tajuddin to throne.\n\nWhen Jalal-ud-din came to know about this, he summoned the erring courtiers to a private conference. But instead of punishing them, he shamed them by daring them to kill him with his own sword. The courtiers asked for forgiveness, attributing their behavior to alcohol intoxication, with Nusrat Sabbah making a \"clever and flattering confession\". The meeting ended with wine-drinking and poetry recitals by Jalal-ud-din.\n\nJalal-ud-din was lenient towards his detractors, and even the most persistent detractors were only banished to their \"iqtas\" for one year. The only instance in which he meted out more severe punishments was during the alleged conspiracy of Sidi Maula.\n\nSidi Maula was a foreign-born religious leader, who belonged to a sect of unorthodox Muslim \"dervishes\". He owned a huge \"khanqah\", and had been reputed for his vast charities since the reign of Qaiqabad. His institution attracted most of the dispossed Balban-era amirs and officers. His followers also included Jalal-ud-din's nobles, including Qazi Jalal Kashani and the now-deceased crown prince \"Khan-i Khanan\".\n\nSidi Maula allegedly planned to kill Jalal-ud-din to become \"khalifa\", although these allegations were never proven. According to a near-contemporary account, the allegations were first made by the jealous \"dervishes\" of a rival sect. It was alleged that Sidi Maula had asked Hathya \"Paik\" and Niranjan \"Kotwal\" to assassinate Jalal-ud-din on a Friday. These two were Balban-era Hindu officers (\"pahilwans\" or wrestlers, according to Ziauddin Barani). Malik Ulghu, the Mongol commander who had entered Jalal-ud-din's service, reported the allegations to Arkali Khan, while Jalal-ud-din was busy besieging Mandawar. Arkali Khan, who disliked the associates of his elder brother \"Khan-i Khanan\", accepted the allegations as true, and arrested the alleged conspirators.\n\nWhen Jalal-ud-din returned to Delhi, the alleged conspirators were brought before him, and pleaded not guilty. The orthodox Muslim \"ulama\", who were unable to present any concrete evidence against the accused, suggested a trial by fire. When Jalal-ud-din was convinced that the accused were guilty, he ordered the Hindu conspirators Hathya and Niranjan to be executed. He then banished Qazi Jalal Kashani and the Balban-era officers who followed Sidi Maula. Next, Jalal-ud-din turned to Sidi Maula, and lost his composure when Sidi Maula repeatedly denied his involvement in the conspiracy. An annoyed Jalal-ud-din asked a group of \"qalandars\" to knife Sidi Maula. Arkali Khan later had the wounded Sidi Maula crushed under the feet of an elephant.\n\nSidi Maula's execution was followed by a severe dust storm, and a drought resulting from the failure of seasonal rains. These conditions resulted in a severe famine, during which the prices of foodgrains became exorbitant, and a number of people committed suicide by jumping into the Yamuna River. Sidi Maula's admirers considered these unfortunate events as proof of his innocence.\n\nAfter deposing Malik Chajju, Jalal-ud-din had appointed his nephew Ali Gurshasp (later Sultan Alauddin Khalji) as the governor of Kara. Ali's father had died when he was young, and Jalal-ud-din had brought him and his brother Almas Beg (later Ulugh Khan) up. Jalal-ud-din had also married his daughters to Ali and Almas. Ali's domestic life was miserable, as he was not on good terms with his wife and his mother-in-law, and he wanted to end his dependence on Jalal-ud-din's family. At Kara, the former supporters of Malik Chajju instigated him to overthrow Jalal-ud-din.\n\nTo raise money for a coup against Jalal-ud-din, Ali raided Bhilsa in 1293. Bhilsa was a temple town in the Paramara kingdom of Malwa, which had already been weakened by Vaghela, Chahamana, and Yadava invasions. As a result of this raid, he obtained a large number of cattle and precious metals. During his stay in Bhilsa, he came to know about the immense wealth of the southern Yadava kingdom, as well as the routes leading to their capital Devagiri. He shrewdly surrendered the loot from Bhilsa to Jalal-ud-din to win the Sultan's confidence, but withheld the information on the Yadava kingdom. Pleased with the loot, Jalal-ud-din gave Ali the office of \"Ariz-i Mamalik\", which was once held by Ali's father. He also granted Ali the governorship of Awadh in addition to that of Kara-Manikpur. He also granted Ali's request to use the surplus revenue for enlisting additional troops to raid the other wealthy but weakly-defended territories beyond Chanderi.\n\nOver the next few years, Ali secretly planned a raid on Devagiri. In 1296, he set out for Devagiri with an 8,000-strong cavalry. He left the administration of Kara to Alaul Mulk, who misled Jalal-ud-din's administration in Delhi about Ali's real destination. At Devagiri, Ali collected a large amount of wealth. When Jalal-ud-din heard about Ali's success at Devagiri, he was pleased at the prospect of a vast treasure coming to him. He moved to Gwalior, hoping that Ali would come there to meet him en route to Kara. However, Ali marched directly towards Kara. Jalal-ud-din's councillors, such as Ahmad Chap, advised him to intercept Ali at Kara, but Jalal-ud-din trusted his nephew, and returned to Delhi. In Delhi, Ali's brother Almas Beg assured the Sultan of Ali's loyalty.\n\nAfter reaching Kara, Ali sent Jalal-ud-din a detailed report on the raid, and expressed concern that his enemies may have poisoned Jalal-ud-din's mind against him. He asked for a signed letter of pardon, which Jalal-ud-din dispatched immediately. At Kara, Jalal-ud-din's messengers were astonished when they learned about Ali's military strength and his plans to dethrone Jalal-ud-din. Ali detained them, and prevented them from communicating with Delhi. Meanwhile, Almas Beg convinced Jalal-ud-din that Ali always carried poison in his handkerchief and would commit suicide out of guilt, if not personally pardoned by Jalal-ud-din. A gullible Jalal-ud-din, concerned about his beloved nephew, asked Almas to visit Kara and dissuade Ali from committing suicide, promising to visit Kara himself shortly after.\n\nIn July 1296, Jalal-ud-din marched to Kara with a large army to meet Ali during the holy month of Ramadan. He directed his commander Ahmad Chap to take the major part of the army to Kara by land, while he himself journeyed down the Ganges River with 1,000 soldiers. When Jalal-ud-din's entourage came close to Kara, Ali sent Almas Beg to meet him. Almas Beg convinced Jalal-ud-din to leave behind his soldiers, saying that their presence would frighten Ali into committing suicide. Jalal-ud-din boarded a boat with a few of his companions, who were made to unbuckle their weapons. As they rode the boat, they saw Ali's armed troops stationed along the riverbank. Almas told them that these troops had been summoned to accord a worthy reception to Jalal-ud-din. Jalal-ud-din complained about Ali's lack of courtesy in not coming to greet him at this point. However, Almas convinced him of Ali's loyalty by saying that Ali was busy arranging a presentation of the loot from Devagiri and a feast for him.\n\nSatisfied by this explanation, Jalal-ud-din continued his journey to Kara, reciting Quran on the boat. When he landed at Kara, Ali's retinue greeted him, and Ali ceremoniously threw himself at his feet. Jalal-ud-din lovingly raised Ali, gave him a kiss on cheek, and chided him for doubting his uncle's affection. At this point, Ali signaled his follower Muhammad Salim, who struck Jalal-ud-din with his sword twice. Jalal-ud-din survived the first blow, and ran towards his boat, but the second blow killed him. Ali raised the royal canopy over his head, and proclaimed himself the new Sultan. Jalal-ud-din's head was put on a spear and paraded across Ali's provinces of Kara-Manikpur and Awadh. His companions on the boat were also killed, and Ahmad Chap's army retreated to Delhi.\n\nAccording to the contemporary writer Amir Khusrau, Ali ascended the throne (as Alauddin Khalji) on 19 July 1296 (16 Ramadan 695). The later writer Ziauddin Barani dates Jalal-ud-din's death and Ali's ascension to 20 July 1296, but Amir Khusrau is more reliable.\n\nJalal-ud-din's courtier Amir Khusrau wrote \"Miftah al-Futuh\" (1291) to commemorate his victories.\n\n\n"}

A member of the Khalji dynasty, he was a son of Alauddin Khalji.\n\nAfter Alauddin's death, Mubarak Shah was imprisoned by Malik Kafur, who appointed his younger brother Shihabuddin Omar as a puppet monarch. After Malik Kafur's murder, Mubarak Shah became the regent. Soon after, he blinded his brother, and usurped the power. After ascending the throne, he resorted to populist measures, such as abolishing the heavy taxes and penalties imposed by his father, and releasing thousands of prisoners.\n\nHe curbed a rebellion in Gujarat, recaptured Devagiri, and successfully besieged Warangal to extract a tribute. He was murdered because of a conspiracy by his slave general Khusrau Khan, who succeeded him on the throne.\n\nMubarak Shah, also called Mubarak Khan, was a son of Alauddin Khalji and Jhatyapali, the daughter of Ramachandra of Devagiri. After Alauddin died on 4 January 1316, his slave-general Malik Kafur appointed Alauddin's 6-year-old son Shihabuddin as a puppet monarch, and himself held the power as regent. At Shihabuddin's coronation ceremony, Mubarak Shah and other sons of Alauddin were ordered to kiss Shihabuddin's feet.\n\nLater, Kafur started persecuting Alauddin's family members, whom he considered a threat to his control over the throne. Mubarak Shah, who was a major threat as one of the few adult sons of Alauddin, was imprisoned. The former bodyguards (\"paiks\") of Alauddin, who disapproved of Kafur's actions, freed Mubarak Shah after killing Kafur. According to an account mentioned by the 16th century chronicler Firishta, Kafur had sent some \"paiks\" to blind Mubarak Shah, but the captive prince gave them his jeweled necklace, and convinced them to kill Kafur instead. However, this account is a later-day fabrication: according to the earlier chronicler Ziauddin Barani, the \"paiks\" took the initiative to kill Kafur on their own.\n\nAfter Kafur's murder, the nobles offered the post of regent (\"naib-i mulk\") to Mubarak Shah. However, Mubarak Shah believed that as a regent, his life would be in constant danger. Initially, he rejected the offer, and instead requested to be allowed to flee to another country with his mother. Nevertheless, the nobles persuaded him to accept the regency.\n\nMubarak Shah thus became the regent of his younger step-brother Shihabuddin. Some weeks later, he accused Shihabuddin's mother Jhatyapalli of trying to poison him. Subsequently, he had Shihabuddin imprisoned in Gwalior and blinded, and usurped the throne.\n\nMubarak Shah ascended the throne with the title Qutubuddin on 14 April 1316, when he was 17 or 18 years old. Mubarak Shah retained Alauddin's officers and governors, which ensured a stable government during the first year of his reign. He also made some new appointments:\n\n\nThe \"paiks\" who had killed Malik Kafur claimed credit for putting Mubarak Shah on the throne, and demanded high positions in his court. Mubarak Khan had them beheaded instead.\n\nMubarak Shah attributed his rise to power to the divine will. He once asked his courtiers if any of them had expected him to become the king. When they replied in negative, he declared that the Allah had made him the king, and only the Allah could remove him from that position. He assumed the title \"Khalifatullah\" (\"Representative of God\"), which appears on his coins.\n\nTo win popular support, Mubarak Shah revoked several of Alauddin's decisions:\n\n\nBefore his death, Malik Kafur had conspired to kill Alp Khan, the governor of Gujarat. Because of this, the Sultanate's army in Gujarat, led by Haidar and Zirak, had revolted. Kafur had dispatched the Devagiri governor Ayn al-Mulk Multani to suppress the rebellion. During his march to Gujarat, near Chittor, Multani received the news that Kafur had been killed. His officers then decided to abandon the march until further orders from Delhi.\n\nAfter ascending the throne, Mubarak Shah sent Malik Tughluq to Multani's camp, asking him to continue the march to Gujarat. However, Multani's officers suggested waiting for 1-2 months before implementing the orders, as they had not seen the new Sultan, and were not convinced that his rule would be stable. Tughluq determined that the dissenting officers wanted their posts to be guaranteed under the new regime. Therefore, he marched back to Delhi, and advised Mubarak Shah to send each officer a \"firman\" (letter of authority) and a \"khilat\" (robe of honour). The Sultan agreed, and when Malik Tughluq returned to Chittor, the officers agreed to continue their march to Gujarat. Tughluq led the vanguard, while Multani held the supreme command of the army.\n\nMultani convinced most of the rebels to join his forces. Haidar, Zirak and their supporters had to flee Gujarat. Mubarak Shah then appointed his father-in-law Malik Dinar Zafar Khan as the governor of Gujarat. The new governor compromised with the Hindu chiefs, and governed the province well. He collected a large sum of money from the chiefs and landholders of Gujarat, and sent it to Delhi.\n\nIn his second regnal year, Mubarak Shah executed Zafar Khan for unknown reasons, and appointed his homosexual partner Husamuddin as the governor of Gujarat. After Husamuddin was deposed by the local amirs for apostacy, Mubarak Shah appointed Wahiduddin Quraishi as the new governor of Gujarat. Quraishi was also given the title \"Sadrul Mulk\". After Ayn al-Mulk Multani was sent to govern Devagiri, Quraishi was recalled to Delhi, and appointed \"wazir\" with the title \"Tajul Mulk\".\n\nThe Yadava kingdom, with its capital at Devagiri in the Deccan region, had become a tributary state to Delhi during Alauddin's reign. Alauddin had decided against annexing the Deccan kingdoms to his empire, because it was difficult to control these distant territories from Delhi. However, after the rebellion of the last Yadava tributary Bhillama, his general Malik Kafur had taken charge of Devagiri, and had received letters of submission from the various chiefs. After Malik Kafur was recalled to Delhi, Ayn al-Mulk Multani acted as the governor of Devagiri, but later, he too was recalled to crush a rebellion in Gujarat.\n\nTaking advantage of this, the Yadavas seized Devagiri, and declared their independence. They were led by Harapaladeva (or Hirpal), who was probably a son-in-law of the former Yadava monarch Ramachandra, and his prime minister Raghava (or Raghu).\n\nMubarak Shah wanted to recapture Devagiri immediately after his ascension, but his counsellors had advised him against attempting to do so without consolidating his rule in Delhi first. In April 1317, during the second year of his reign, Mubarak Shah marched to Devagiri with a large army. Before leaving Delhi, he assigned the administration to his father-in-law Shahin with the title Vafa Malik.\n\nMubarak Shah followed the well-known route to Devagiri, assembling his forces at Tilpat near Delhi, and then marching to Devagiri in around two months. When the army reached Devagiri, all the local chiefs except Raghava and Harapaladeva accepted Mubarak Shah's suzerainty without offering any resistance.\n\nRaghava and his nearly 10,000-strong cavalry, as well as Harapaladeva, fled to the hilly region near Devagiri. The Delhi generals Khusrau Khan and Malik Qutlugh (who held the title \"amir-i shikar\") led an army to pursue them. The Delhi forces completely routed Raghava's army. Khusrau Khan dispatched a force led by \"amir-i koh\" Malik Ikhtiyaruddin Talbagha (son of Yaghda) to pursue Harapaladeva, who was wounded and captured after 2-3 skirmishes. Harapaladeva was presented before Mubarak Shah, who ordered his beheading. The body of Harapaladeva was hung at the gates of Devagiri.\n\nMubarak Shah spent some time consolidating his rule in Deccan. Malik Yaklakhi, who had served as Alauddin's Naib-i-Barid-i-Mumalik, was appointed as the governor of Devagiri.\n\nThe Kakatiya kingdom, with its capital at Warangal, was another kingdom tributary to Alauddin. However, the Kakatiya ruler Prataparudra had stopped making tribute payments to Delhi. Therefore, Mubarak Shah sent an army to subjugate him. The army was led by Khusrau Khan, Khwaja Haji (who had served as Alauddin's minister of war), and Malik Qutlugh (\"amir-i shikar\"). The Delhi army besieged the Kakatiya capital Warangal, and Prataparudra decided to negotiate truce after putting up some resistance. He surrendered a huge amount of wealth to the invaders, and agreed to make regular tribute payments.\n\nAfter subduing the Kakatiyas, Khusrau Khan marched to Ellora, where Mubarak Shah had been residing for a month. The rest of the army joined him on the banks of the Narmada River on his way back to Delhi.\n\nMubarak Shah was bisexual. His harem had a large number of women, many of which accompanied him on his campaigns. After killing his brother Khizr Khan, he took the latter's widow Deval into his own harem. According to the 16th century historian Firishta, who calls Mubarak Shah \"a monster in the shape of man\", Mubarak Shah used to parade naked prostitutes on the terraces of his palaces and make them urinate on the nobles entering his court.\n\nMubarak Shah also had homosexual relations with two uterine brothers, Hasan (later Khusrau Khan) and Husamuddin (or Hisamuddin). According to Amir Khusrau's \"Tughluq Nama\", the two brothers belonged to a Hindu military caste called Baradu. They had been captured during Ayn al-Mulk Multani-led 1305 conquest of Malwa. They were brought as slaves to Delhi, where they were brought up by Alauddin's \"naib-i khas-i hajib\" Malik Shadi. The two brothers acted as passive homosexuals only to maintain their status and position. Mubarak Shah appointed Husamuddin as the governor of Gujarat, after executing the former governor Malik Dinar Zafar Khan for no apparent reason. Husamuddin later became an apostate (from Islam), because of which the amirs of Gujarat arrested him, and sent him to Delhi in chains. Mubarak Shah merely slapped him, and gave him a high position in the royal court.\n\nMubarak Shah preferred Hasan as a partner, but turned to Husamuddin whenever Hasan was not available. Their relationship was not a secret, and Mubarak and Hasan used to exchange hugs and kisses in public. Mubarak gave Hasan the title \"Khusrau Khan\", several iqta, the army of the deceased Malik Kafur, and the \"wizarat\". According to the chronicler Barani, Mubarak became \"so enamored by Hasan ... that he did not want to be parted from him for a moment.\" Barani further states that Hasan resented \"the way the Sultan forced himself upon him and took advantage of him\", and secretly planned revenge against him. Mubarak's other subordinates warned him about Khusrau's treacherous plans, but while being sodomized by the Sultan, Khusrau convinced him that the accusers were falsely slandering him. Mubarak was ultimately killed by Khusrau Khan's accomplices.\n\nKhusrau Khan convinced Mubarak Shah to allow him to raise an army of Baradu Hindus by arguing that all other nobles (\"maliks\") had their own groups of followers. He enlisted several soldiers at Bahilwal (near Mount Abu and in the province of Gujarat. According to \"Tughluq Nama\", this army included 10,000 Baradu horsemen, and was commanded by several Hindu chiefs (\"rais\" and \"ranas\").\n\nNext, Khusrau Khan contacted officers who resented Sultan Mubarak Shah. Bahauddin, a \"dabir\" who had quarreled with the Sutan over a woman, joined the Baradu coinspiracy. Yusuf Sahi, Shaista (son of Muhammad Qirrat Qamar), and some other officers also joined Khusrau Khan. Initially, the Baradus planned to kill the Sultan during a hunting expedition in Sirsawah, but Yusuf Sahi and his colleagues opposed the plan arguing that the Sultan's army would kill the conspirators in an open field. Instead, they suggested killing the Sultan in the royal \"Hazar Sutun\" palace, and capturing all the nobles at the palace. Khusrau Khan then told the Sultan that he wanted his men to be granted access to the palace, so that they could meet him without requiring him to leave the Sultan's company. The Sultan obliged, and subsequently, every night 300-400 Baradus started entering the palace. They assembled in the former chambers of Malik Kafur on the ground floor of the palace, which had been assigned to Khusrau Khan.\n\nOn 7 May 1320, Qazi Ziyauddin, a teacher of the Sultan, suggested an investigation into the assembly of the Baradus. However, the Sultan angrily dismissed the suggestion, and none of the nobles dared to make a similar suggestion. Barani claims when the Sultan told Mubarak Shah about Qazi Ziyauddin's suggestion, Mubarak Shah won over his confidence by making love with him.\n\nOn the night of 9 July 1320, Qazi Ziyauddin visited the ground floor of the palace to supervise the palace guard. Randhol, the maternal uncle of Khusrau Khan, entered the palace with a large number of Baradus, who hid daggers under their clothes. When Ziyauddin let his guard down to accept a \"paan\" (betel leaf preparation) from Randhol, the Baradu leader Jaharya stabbed him to death. The Sultan, who was in the company of Khusrau Khan on the upper floor, heard the commotion caused by Ziyauddin's murder. However, Khusrau Khan told him that the royal horses had broken loose, and the noise was caused by the guards trying to catch the animals. Meanwhile, Jaharya and other Baradus entered the upper floor, and killed the Sultan's special guards - Ibrahim and Ishaq. The Sultan now realized that a rebellion was happening against him, and tried to escape to his harem, which was located a floor above. However, Khusrau Khan stopped him by seizing his hair. The Sultan knocked Khusrau Khan to the ground, and sat on his chest, but Khusrau Khan did not let go of his hair. Meanwhile, Jaharya arrived at the scene, stuck a \"patta\" (axe) at the Sultan's chest, lifted him up by his hair, and threw him to the ground. He then beheaded the Sultan, and the head was later thrown in the courtyard on the ground floor. The royal guards fled to save their lives, as a large number of Baradus started massacring the palace residents. \n\nLegend says that Mubarak Shah did not like the famous Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya, because Khizr Khan - the brother whom Mubarak Shah put to death - was a disciple of the saint. Mubarak Shah started patronizing the rival saint Shaikhzada Jam, but Shaikhzada Jam did not become as reputed as Nizamuddin Auliya. Mubarak Shah then tried to prop up Shaikh Ruknuddin of Multan as a rival to Nizamuddin by declaring that he would personally consider all the petitions passed to him through the saint. However, Ruknuddin did not emerge as a rival of Nizamuddin either. Nizamuddin met and saluted Mubarak Shah at a Quran-reading ceremony (\"siyyum\") after the death of Shaikh Ziyauddin Rumi, but Mubarak Shah did not acknowledge the salutation. Subsequently, he announced a reward of 1,000 \"tankas\" (coins) for anyone who brought him the head of Nizamuddin. When Mubarak Shah constructed a jama masjid called \"Masjid-i-Miri\" and asked all Muslim scholars (\"ulama\") and mystics to assemble there for the Friday prayers, Nizamuddin refused to oblige, declaring that he would visit the mosque closest to his home instead. In June-July 1320, when the notable people of Delhi visited the Sultan to greet him on the beginning of a new lunar month (\"Jamadi\"), Nizamuddin sent his servant-disciple instead of personally visiting the Sultan. Mubarak then declared that if Nizamuddin did not visit him personally at the beginning of the next lunar month, he would compel the saint to do so via an executive order. Nizamuddin did not respond and instead prayed at his mother's grave. At the beginning of the next month (1 Jamadi II), Mubarak Shah was killed. The Baradus killed or blinded the other surviving sons of Alauddin to eliminate Khalji claims to the throne, and also killed Mubarak Shah's mother Jhatyapali.\n\n"}

He is best known for winning the Men's Singles at the 1948 Wimbledon Championships and for introducing soft ice cream and American fast food to Brazil in 1952. He is the founder of the Brazilian fast food chain \"Bob's.\"\n\nFalkenburg was born in New York City on January 29, 1926 and grew up in Los Angeles, California in a tennis playing family. His parents, Eugene \"Genie\" Lincoln Falkenburg (an engineer involved in the construction of Hoover Dam) and Marguerite \"Mickey\" Crooks Falkenburg were amateur tennis players. While employed by Westinghouse, Eugene was transferred to South America, where he moved with his wife and three children to São Paulo, Brazil. There Mickey won the state tennis championship in 1927. Mickey was always involved in tennis. In \"The Game: My 40 Years in Tennis\", tennis champion Jack Kramer wrote that Mickey Falkenburg was \"the first person to ever suggest to him the idea of a team-tennis league,\" a league which he later created. Bob's sister, Jinx Falkenburg, an American film star/model and radio and television talk show host, was also an amateur tennis player and his brother Tom had a successful tennis career as well.\n\nFalkenburg started to play tennis in 1936 when he was 10 years old. Like other players from Southern California, he frequently played at the Los Angeles Tennis Club in Hollywood, which was located very close to the family home. Bob also played at the Bel-Air Country Club where he won the junior tennis tournament in 1937. As a youngster he participated in different tournaments around the city.\n\nIn 1942 and 1943 while attending Fairfax High School, Falkenburg won the National Interscholastic singles title and won the national doubles title with his brother, Tom. In 1943, Bob became the Los Angeles city singles title holder. The following year he claimed the United States doubles crown with Don McNeill at Forest Hills, New York. In 1943 Bob became one of the youngest players to enter the US Top 10 amateur ranks. He remained in the US Top 10 for 5 years, whilst he was ranked as high as World No. 7 by sports journalist John Olliff of The Daily Telegraph.\n\nFrom 1944 to 1945, during World War II Falkenburg served in the military as an air cadet. Being enlisted in the service, however, did not put a complete halt to his tennis career and he continued to occasionally play while in the Air Force. In 1946, while attending the University of Southern California, he won the NCAA singles and doubles titles. He teamed again with his brother Tom to capture that NCAA doubles final.\n\nBob was very agile and was known for his powerful serves. At the age of 20 he was considered to have \"the fastest serve in tennis.\" After marrying a Brazilian, Lourdes Mayrink Veiga Machado, in 1947 he moved to Rio de Janeiro in 1950, where he played on the 1954 and 1955 Brazilian Davis Cup teams.\n\nIn 1947 he paired with Jack Kramer and together they won the Wimbledon doubles title. A year later, in 1948, Falkenburg reached the pinnacle of his tennis career by winning the Wimbledon singles championship. He won the acclaimed tennis crown, after winning 3 of 5 sets against Australian John Bromwich, who after having taken the fourth set, was confident he would beat Falkenburg. Bromwich had a match point at 5–3 in the fifth set, but Falkenburg fought his way back and did something that tennis players rarely do; he saved three match points and went on to win 7–5 in the fifth set.\n\nIt took 71 years before Falkenburg’s feat was repeated. At Wimbledon in 2019, Novak Djokovic fought off Roger Federer by saving two championship points in the fifth and final set to win the men's title for the fifth time. Falkenburg won Wimbledon because he was not only a great tennis player, but a superb strategist. Fellow tennis player Tom Brown, who was a runner up in the 1947 Wimbledon Championships described Falkenburg's competitive approach, \"He would review the situation, figure out what was likely, and take chances.\"\n\nFalkenburg has been inducted into numerous Halls of Fame, including the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1974, the Intercollegiate Tennis Hall of Fame in 1985, the Fairfax High School Hall of Fame in 1999, the U.S.C. Hall of Fame in 2009 and the Southern California Tennis Association Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nFalkenburg was offered a $100,000-a-year professional tennis contract. He turned it down and instead decided to open an ice cream and fast food business in Brazil. With $10,000 and a few ice cream machines he brought from the United States, he was set to open his ice cream shop. It was not easy for him to start his business. He encountered numerous import restrictions, as the Brazilian government would not allow him to import the ingredients to make soft ice cream, so he worked out how to make his own ice cream mixes and toppings. Facing many obstacles, Falkenburg never gave up, and succeeded in opening his business in Rio de Janeiro. Soon after opening the first ice cream shop near the famed Copacabana beach front in 1952, his business became a success. Falkenburg's soft ice cream was the first time it was introduced to Brazil.\n\nA year later, the ice cream shop became a fast food restaurant. The restaurant, called \"Bob's,\" was the first fast food restaurant in South America. Bob's menu includes traditional American food such as hamburgers, hot dogs, milkshakes and sundaes. Because it offered new tastes and a modern look, Bob's became a hit with the Brazilian glitterati, making Bob's the most prosperous food business in Brazil and giving Falkenburg earnings far greater than what he would have made as a professional tennis player. Today, Bob's, no longer owned by Falkenburg, has over 1,000 locations in Brazil, as well as franchises in 4 other countries.\n\nFalkenburg not only found success on the tennis court and fast food industry, but he also had a successful amateur golf career. He played in many international golf championships and won the Brazilian amateur championship three times. He took part in renowned golf tournaments including the Bob Hope Desert Classic, where his team won in 1967; the Bing Crosby Pro-Am in Pebble Beach, where he played several times; the Eisenhower Cup, where he played for Brazil in Rome in 1964, Mexico City in 1966 and Melbourne in 1968; and in the United Kingdom at the British Amateur Golf Championship, where he led the American contingent on the first qualifying round after having a hole-in-one at Carnoustie. He also participated as an amateur in various European golf championships in France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and several Scandinavian countries.\n\nIn 1970 the Falkenburgs moved back to Southern California and, in 1974 at the age of 48, he sold the \"Bob's\" chain (which at the time had 12 stores) to Libby of Brazil (later acquired by Nestlé). Retired in Los Angeles, Bob spent a lot of time playing golf at the Bel-Air Country Club, where he would often play with former Los Angeles Lakers star and good friend Jerry West and others. Later Falkenburg went on to become the president of the club. He and his wife currently reside in Santa Ynez, California.\n\n\n"}

Subsequently, as a traffic police officer, she oversaw traffic arrangements for the 1982 Asian Games in Delhi and the 1983 CHOGM meet in Goa. As DCP of North Delhi, she launched a campaign against drug abuse, which evolved into the Navjyoti Delhi Police Foundation (renamed to Navjyoti India Foundation in 2007).\n\nIn May 1993, she was posted to the Delhi Prisons as Inspector General (IG). She introduced several reforms at Tihar Jail, which gained worldwide acclaim and won her the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1994. In 2003, Bedi became the first Indian woman to be appointed as a Police Advisor to Secretary-General of the United Nations, in the Department of Peace Keeping Operations. She resigned in 2007, to focus on social activism and writing. She has written several books, and runs the India Vision Foundation. During 2008–11, she also hosted a court show \"Aap Ki Kachehri\". She was one of the key leaders of the 2011 Indian anti-corruption movement, and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in January 2015. She unsuccessfully contested the 2015 Delhi Assembly election as the party's Chief Ministerial candidate. On 22 May 2016, Bedi was appointed as the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry.\n\nBedi was born on 9 June 1949 in Amritsar, in a well-to-do Punjabi business family. She is the second child of Prakash Lal Peshawaria and Prem Lata (born Janak Arora). She has three sisters: Shashi, Reeta, and Anu. Her great-great grandfather Lala Hargobind had migrated from Peshawar to Amritsar, where he set up a business. Bedi's upbringing was not very religious, but she was brought up in both Hindu and Sikh traditions (her grandmother was a Sikh). Prakash Lal helped with the family's textile business, and also played tennis. Bedi's grandfather Muni Lal controlled the family business, and gave an allowance to her father. He cut this allowance when Bedi's elder sister Shashi was enrolled in the Sacred Heart Convent School, Amritsar. Although the school was 16 km away from their home, Shashi's parents believed it offered better education than other schools. Muni Lal was opposed to his grandchild being educated in a Christian school. However, Prakash Lal declared financial independence, and went on to enroll all his daughters, including Kiran, in the same school. Bedi started her formal studies in 1954, at the Sacred Heart Convent School in Amritsar. She participated in National Cadet Corps (NCC), among other extra-curricular activities. At that time, Sacred Heart did not offer science; instead, it had a subject called \"household\", which was aimed at grooming girls into good housewives. When she was in Class 9, Bedi joined Cambridge College, a private institute that offered science education and prepared her for matriculation exam. By the time her former schoolmates at Sacred Heart cleared Class 9, she cleared Class 10 (matriculation) exam. Bedi graduated in 1968, with a BA (Honours) in English, from Government College for Women at Amritsar. The same year, she won the NCC Cadet Officer Award. In 1970, she obtained a master's degree in political science from Panjab University, Chandigarh.\nFrom 1970 to 1972, Bedi taught as a lecturer at Khalsa College for Women in Amritsar. She taught courses related to political science. Later, during her career in the Indian Police Service, she also earned a law degree at Delhi University in 1988 and a Ph.D. from IIT Delhi's Department of Social Sciences in 1993.\n\nInspired by her father, Bedi started playing tennis at the age of nine. As a teenage tennis player, she cut her hair short as they interfered with her game. In 1964, she played her first tournament outside Amritsar, participating in the national junior lawn tennis championship at Delhi Gymkhana. She lost in early rounds, but won the trophy two years later, in 1966. As the national champion, she was eligible for entry to the Wimbledon junior championship, but was not nominated by the Indian administration.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1978, Bedi won several tennis championships, including:\n\nBedi was also a part of Indian team that beat Sri Lanka to win the Lionel Fonseka Memorial Trophy in Colombo. She continued playing tennis until the age of thirty, when she started focusing on her Indian Police Service career. In 1972, she married fellow tennis player Brij Bedi; the two had met on Service Club courts in Amritsar.\n\nAs a young woman, Bedi frequented the Service Club in Amritsar, where interaction with senior civil servants inspired her to take up a public service career. On 16 July 1972, Bedi started her police training at the National Academy of Administration in Mussoorie. She was the only woman in a batch of 80 men, and became the first woman IPS officer. After a 6-month foundation course, she underwent another 9 months of police training at Mount Abu in Rajasthan, and further training with Punjab Police in 1974. Based on a draw, she was allocated to the union territory cadre (now called AGMUT or Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram-Union Territories cadre).\n\nBedi's first posting was to the Chanakyapuri subdivision of Delhi in 1975. The same year, she became the first woman to lead the all-male contingent of the Delhi Police at the Republic Day Parade in 1975. Her daughter Sukriti (later Saina) was born in September 1975.\n\nChanakyapuri was an affluent area that included the Parliament building, foreign embassies, and the residences of the Prime Minister and the President. The crimes in the area were mainly limited to minor thefts, but political demonstrations (which sometimes turned violent) were a regular occurrence. During the 1970s, there were many clashes between Nirankari and Akali Sikhs. On 15 November 1978, a group of Nirankaris held a congregation near India Gate. A contingent of 700–800 Akalis organized a demonstration against them. DCP Bedi's platoon was deployed to stop the protesters and prevent violence. As the protesters resorted to brick-batting, Bedi charged them with a cane, although there was no tear gas squad to support her unit. One of the demonstrators ran towards her with a naked sword, but she charged him as well as other demonstrators with a cane. Ultimately, her unit was able to disperse the demonstrators. For this action, Bedi was awarded the President's Police Medal for Gallantry (1979), in October 1980.\n\nIn 1979, Bedi was posted to Delhi's West District, where there were not enough officers to handle the high volume of criminal activity. To compensate, she started recruiting civilian volunteers. Each village in the district was night patrolled by six civilians led by an armed policeman. She enabled anonymous reporting of any knowledge about crimes. She clamped down on bootlegging and the illicit liquor business to reduce crimes in the area. Bedi implemented an open door policy, which encouraged citizens to interact with her. She implemented a \"beat box\" system: a complaint box was installed in each ward, and the beat constables were instructed to have their lunch near this box at a set time each day. She regularly asked people if they knew about the beat constable assigned to their area, and also walked with the constables to raise their self-esteem. Within 3 months, there was a reduction in crimes. There was a drop in cases related to \"eve teasing\" (sexual harassment of women) and wife beating. This gained her the goodwill of local women, who also volunteered their services to help fight crime in the area.\n\nIn October 1981, Bedi was made DCP (Traffic). The preparation for the 1982 Asian Games had caused traffic snarls in the city. The construction of 19 sports stadiums and several flyovers had resulted in a number of blockades and diversions. Bedi encouraged coordination between the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking and Delhi Development Authority. She clamped down on errant motorists with a heavy hand. She replaced challans (traffic tickets) with spot fines. Her team towed improperly parked vehicles using six tow trucks (\"cranes\") for traffic control. This earned her the nickname \"Crane Bedi\". On 5 August 1982, an Ambassador car (DHI 1817) belonging to Prime Minister Office was towed away by sub-inspector Nirmal Singh, as it was wrongly parked outside the Yusufzai Market at Connaught Place. Singh was fully supported by Bedi and her superior Ashok Tandon.\n\nTo raise funds for traffic guidance materials, Bedi presented Asian Games traffic management plan to a group of sponsors. The sponsors committed to providing road safety and other educational material worth 35,00,000. She also bought traffic police jeeps for her officers; for the first time, four wheelers were allocated to inspectors in the traffic unit. After the Asian Games were over, she was given \"Asian Jyoti\" award for excellence. She refused to accept the award for herself alone, and recommended that it be given to entire traffic unit.\n\nBedi did not spare errant motorists from the rich and influential section of the society, which resulted in a powerful lobby against her. Her victims included the Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation and her own sister-in-law. After the Asian Games were over, she was transferred to Goa for 3 years. According to contemporary rumours, Indira Gandhi's aides R. K. Dhawan and Yashpal Kapoor, as well as her yoga instructor Dhirendra Brahmachari (whom Bedi had personally fined for a wrongly parked car), played a role in her transfer. According to another theory, the loss of revenue resulting from her experiment of holding classes for traffic violators (instead of fining them) was a major factor in her transfer.\n\nHer 7-year-old daughter suffered from nephritic syndrome since the age of 3, and was seriously ill at the time. Bedi requested the Home Ministry to not to transfer her out of Delhi until her daughter's condition became stable. According to Bedi, she had put herself in a \"very vulnerable situation\", and the only people who could help her were the ones \"who had been offended by my 'equal enforcement of law'\". Her request was not entertained, and she had to leave behind her daughter, who was too ill to accompany her.\n\nBedi arrived in Goa in March 1983, on a three-year assignment. A few months after her arrival, the Zuari Bridge was completed but not opened to public; the state government wanted Indira Gandhi to come from Delhi and inaugurate it formally. However, they were not able to secure confirmation from Indira Gandhi for several days. The public had to use ferries to transfer their vehicles across the Zuari River. One day, during a patrol, Bedi noticed that there was a huge mass at the ferry boarding point. She drove to the bridge, removed the blockades and diverted the traffic waiting at ferry to the bridge. This unofficial inauguration angered many politicians. In November 1983, Goa hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meet (CHOGM). Bedi involved NCC cadets in Goa for traffic regulation along the VIP routes.\n\nShortly after the CHOGM ended, her daughter's medical condition worsened. Bedi applied for leave, so that she could go to Delhi and take care of her daughter. Until this point, she had not taken privilege leave in her decade-long career, and her leaves had always lapsed. Inspector General of Police (IGP) Rajendra Mohan recommended her leave application, but the leave was not officially sanctioned by the Goa government. Bedi left for Delhi anyway, since she had enough leaves in her account. Her daughter was hospitalised at AIIMS for one week. After her daughter was discharged from hospital, Bedi decided to stay in Delhi until her recovery. Bedi sent a personal letter to the IGP, as well as a detailed explanation to the Goa government, with medical reports and certificates. However, in a statement to United News of India (UNI), the Goa Chief Minister Pratapsingh Rane declared her absconding and absent without leave. After seeing Bedi's daughter's condition in Delhi, UNI published a rebuttal to the Chief Minister's statement. This made Goa government even more hostile to Bedi.\n\nAfter being declared absent without sanctioned leave, Bedi was not given any assignment for six months. When her daughter's condition became stable, she met the Union Home Secretary T. N. Chaturvedi, who reinstated her. She was assigned to the Railway Protection Force in New Delhi, as a Deputy Commandant. Six months later, after appealing to a senior official in Prime Minister's Office, she was reassigned to the Department of Industrial Development, as a deputy director. There, she worked under the Directorate General of Industrial Contingency (DGIC), as a strike mediator between labor and management. Bedi left DGIC in October 1985, and shortly after her departure, the organization was wound up as part of an economy drive.\n\nIn 1985, Police Commissioner Ved Marwah made a special request for Bedi to be assigned to the police headquarters. There, Bedi cleared several pending files and sanctioned 1,600 promotions in a single day to motivate the staff.\n\nIn 1986, Bedi became DCP of Delhi's North District, where the primary problem was drug abuse. At that time, Delhi had only one centre for treatment of drug addicts – \"Ashiana\", which was run by the New Delhi Municipal Corporation. With help from her superiors, Bedi set up a detox center in one of the police premises. The center relied on community donations of furniture, blankets, medicines and other supplies. It also received voluntary services from doctors and yoga teachers. Within a year, five more detox centers were set up. Each center was intended to serve up to 30 patients, but at one time, each center catered to around 100 patients. The initiative was widely noticed, and Bedi travelled all over India, giving presentations and lectures on the programme. Before she was transferred to a new post, she and 15 other police officers institutionalized the detox centers as Navjyoti Police Foundation for Correction, De-addiction and Rehabilitation. Bedi served as the General Secretary of the Foundation.\n\nIn the 1980s, Bedi attracted ire of Delhi politicians and lawyers. First, she ordered lathi charge on a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) assembly in Red Fort area, and arrested its leaders. A few months later, she arrested Congress(I) MP J.P. Agarwal for violating curfew orders.\n\nIn January 1988, the Delhi Police caught a man stealing from a girl's purse at St. Stephen's College. A few weeks later, he was arrested again for trespassing into a women's toilet and writing obscene graffiti inside. One of Bedi's officers arrested and handcuffed the man. When he was produced in the court, he was recognized as Rajesh Agnihotri, a lawyer practicing at the Tis Hazari Courts Complex. The man had given a different name when he was arrested, and his lawyer colleagues claimed that he had been falsely framed. The protesters also argued that lawyers must not be handcuffed even if there are proper grounds for their arrest. Bedi vociferously defended her officer's action. The lawyers organized a strike and led a procession to DCP (North) office. Not finding DCP Bedi at the office, the lawyers manhandled Additional DCP Sandhu. This led to a scuffle between the cops and the lawyers. The lawyers escalated their strike, and several politicians supported the lawyers in demanding suspension of Bedi.\n\nOn 21 January, the police lathi-charged the striking lawyers in Tis Hazari complex. This further enraged the lawyers. On 17 February, a mob of an estimated 600–1000 people led by the Congress corporator Rajesh Yadav arrived at Tis Hazari court. The mob was armed with brickbats, hockey sticks and small rods. It raised slogans in support of Bedi and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. It stoned the lawyers' chambers and smashed the windscreens of their cars. The police force deployed in the area did not try to stop the mob violence, although some individual policemen tried to control the mob. Bedi denied any connivance in the incident. The police later arrested Rajesh Yadav, and charged him with rioting and conspiracy. The Congress distanced itself from Yadav and ousted him.\n\nFor the next two months, the lawyers stopped courts from functioning in Delhi and neighbouring states, demanding Bedi's resignation. The strike was called off after the Delhi High Court constituted a two-judge committee to investigate the matter. Known as Wadhwa Commission, the committee consisted of Justice DP Wadhwa and Justice NN Goswamy. KK Venugopal, the lawyers' counsel, produced evidence that on 17 February, all police stations in the zone knew that a 2000-strong mob was heading towards Tis Hazari Courts Complex, where the lawyers were on a hunger strike. Despite this, no police force was deputed to protect them. In its interim report, the Commission expressed concern over police lapses. The judges said that they wanted to investigate the matter further, and recommended transfer of five police officers (including Bedi) out of North Delhi, during the investigation period. Even before the report was made public, in April 1988, the Union Government transferred Bedi to the post of Deputy Director (Operations) in the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), also in Delhi. Two days later, the four other officers mentioned in the report were also transferred.\n\nThe members of the Delhi Bar Association were not satisfied with Bedi's transfer, and wanted her suspended. However, the Police Commissioner Ved Marwah refused to suspend Bedi. The Commission's final report, released in April 1990, censured all the parties. The report stated that the arrest of Rajesh Agnihotri was justified, but his handcuffing was illegal. It also concluded that an \"indiscriminate and unjustified\" lathi-charge on the lawyers was ordered by Bedi, and that she had connived with the municipal councillor to organize the mob attack on the lawyers. The scholarly legal commentary was divided, with some supporting Bedi, citing her \"unblemished\" service record.\n\nAfter Bedi was censured by the Wadhwa Commission, it was decided to transfer her out of Delhi. She wanted a challenging posting in either Andamans, Arunachal Pradesh or Mizoram. She hoped that this would lead to her reassignment to Delhi Police after a few years (after \"hard\" postings, government servants are unofficially entitled to a post they desire). She requested Joint Secretary (Union Territories) to transfer her to Mizoram, a remote border state in North-East India. When she didn't get any firm response, she wrote to the home secretary Naresh Kumar. Along with Bedi's batchmate Pardeep Singh, Naresh Kumar convinced the Joint Secretary to transfer her to Mizoram. They pointed out that officers who were given Mizoram posting refused to go there, while Bedi was volunteering to go there. Bedi reported to the Mizoram Government in Aizawl on 27 April 1990. Her designation was Deputy Inspector General (Range). Her parents and her daughter also moved to Mizoram.\n\nConsumption of alcohol, especially home-brewed rice liquor \"Zu\", was very common in Mizoram. Several of Bedi's officers were alcoholics. At first, she didn't stop them since \"Zu\" was a part of Mizo culture, and she didn't want to be seen as someone who interfered with the local culture. Later, she opened an indoor de-addiction facility for alcoholic policemen. The major crime in the district was heroin smuggling across the Burmese border. A number of teenagers were drug addicts, with proxyvon and heroin being the most common drugs. Most of the repeat criminal offenders were alcoholic. Since Mizoram was a Christian-majority state, Bedi utilized Christian prayers to reduce drug and alcohol-induced criminal behavior. She declared Saturdays \"prayer and rehabilitation day\" at district police stations, despite protests from the Superintendent of Police, who was an atheist. Every Saturday, past criminals would be brought to the police station to pray and learn and to receive treatment for alcoholism.\n\nWhile in Mizoram, she completed a major part of her Ph.D. research. (Later, in September 1993, she was awarded a doctorate by IIT Delhi's Department of Social Sciences, for her thesis on Drug Abuse and Domestic Violence.) During her stay in Mizoram, she also started writing her autobiography.\n\nIn September 1992, her daughter Sukriti applied for a seat in Lady Hardinge Medical College (Delhi), under a quota for Mizoram residents. Students of Mizoram launched a violent agitation against the allocation, on the grounds that she was a non-Mizo. Sukriti had topped the merit list with 89% marks, and was given seat from the Central pool, according to the government guidelines. Mizoram's Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla asked her to surrender the seat in \"the larger interests of the state\", although he accepted that \"there was nothing illegal in her daughter getting the seat\". Bedi refused to surrender the seat, saying that her daughter deserved the seat.\n\nAs the protests turned violent, Bedi received threats that her house would be set on fire. Her superiors told her that they could no longer protect her. She left Aizawl after submitting her leave application. Her parents and daughter had already left for Delhi by this time. Lal Thanhawla accused her of insubordination.\n\nAfter leaving her Mizoram assignment incomplete in September 1992, Bedi had to wait eight months for a new posting. In May 1993, she was posted to the Delhi Prisons as inspector general (IG). The Tihar Jail of Delhi was built as a four-jail complex with a capacity of 2,500 prisoners. However, by the time Bedi became its in-charge, its prisoner population varied from 8,000 to 9,500. About 90% of its inmates were undertrials, who had been accused of non-bailable offences. Some of them had been waiting for years to get a trial in a badly clogged court system. The prison had a budget of 15 crore, which was just enough to pay for basic expenditure, leaving little for welfare programmes. Tihar was notorious as a violent and unmanageable place, and no officer wanted to be posted there. The post had been lying vacant for nine months, before Bedi was posted there.\n\nBedi decided to turn Tihar into a model prison. She introduced several reforms. She arranged separate barracks for the hardened criminals, who had been using their time in prison to recruit gang members, sell contraband and extort money. These prisoners unsuccessfully challenged Bedi in court for unfairly segregating them.\n\nFor other prisoners, Bedi arranged vocational training with certificates, so that they could find a job after their release. During her tenure, Indira Gandhi National Open University and National Open School set up their centers inside the prison. Legal cells were set up to help the undertrials. Bedi banned smoking in the prison. The move faced a lot of resistance from the staff as well as the prisoners. She introduced yoga and Vipassana meditation classes to change the prisoners' attitudes. She organized additional activities such as sports, prayer, and festival celebrations. She also established a de-addiction center, and pulled up or imprisoned the staff members involved in drug supply. A bank was also opened inside the prison. A bakery and small manufacturing units, including carpentry and weaving units, were set up in the jail. The profits from the products sold were put into the prisoners' welfare fund.\n\nBedi went on daily prison tours, observing the staff, listening to prisoners'complaints, inspecting food quality and evaluating overall management. She developed a panchayat system, where prisoners who were respected for their age, education, or character represented other inmates and met every evening with senior officers to sort out problems. She also established petition boxes so that prisoners could write to the IG about any issue. While the jail had suggestion boxes earlier too, the jail staff would destroy the complaints received through these boxes. On the other hand, the prisoners writing to Bedi received acknowledgment and information about the status of their petition.\n\nIn this prison reform programme, Bedi involved outsiders – including NGOs, schools, civilians and former inmates. As a result of Bedi's reforms, there was a drop in the fights and disturbances in the jail. Even the hardened criminals, who had been isolated in separate barracks, started behaving well. Bedi then arranged for them to attend education and meditation courses.\n\nIn May 1994, Bedi organized a 'health day', during which around 400 doctors and paramedics were invited to attend to Tihar's patients. Based on visits to two of Tihar's adolescent wards, a cardiologist associated with the Delhi Government's AIDS Control Programme, claimed that two-thirds of the inmates had acknowledged engaging in homosexual acts. He recommended distribution of condoms in the prison, a move supported by Delhi's Health Minister Harsh Vardhan and National AIDS Control Organisation. However, Kiran Bedi opposed the move pointing out that there were no HIV+ prisoners in Tihar. She stated that the distribution of condoms would encourage homosexual activity (illegal as per Section 377) among criminals. Based on a survey conducted through petition boxes, she claimed that incidence of consensual homosexual activity was negligible, and that the doctor's claim had hurt her prisoners. In response, the activist group ABVA filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court demanding distribution of condoms in Tihar. Bedi termed the move as an attempt to force \"western solutions\" on \"Tihar Ashram\", and filed a counter affidavit opposing the demand.\n\nBedi's reform programme at Tihar received worldwide acclaim. But it also attracted envy from her superiors, who accused her of diluting prison security for personal glory. She was not on good terms with her immediate supervisor in the government, the Minister for Prisons Harsharan Singh Balli. Many members of Balli's party, the BJP, had not forgiven Bedi for her lathi charge on the party's assembly in the 1980s. However, until March 1995, Bedi was on good terms with BJP's Delhi Chief Minister Madan Lal Khurana. Khurana was a prisoner in Tihar during the Emergency, and appreciated her work for prisoners.\n\nIn 1994, Bedi was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award and the Nehru Fellowship. The Magsaysay Foundation recognized her leadership and innovations in crime control, drug rehabilitation, and humane prison reform. The US President Bill Clinton invited her to National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C.. When the Delhi Government refused to let her accept the invitation, Bedi lobbied with the Union Home Ministry to get the clearance. However, the Home Minister S.B. Chavan declined the permission. Clinton repeated the invitation in 1995, and this time, Bedi approached the media. The \"New York Times\" published a report stating that \"several politicians and her superiors were feeling cut up with her assertive style and the success that followed her\". Under pressure from the public and the media, Chavan allowed Bedi to attend the Breakfast. However, this episode won her several detractors in the government.\n\nSometime later, Bedi was invited by the United Nations to discuss social reintegration of prisoners at the Copenhagen Social Summit. When the Delhi Government refused to permit her, Bedi met the Minister of State for Home Rajesh Pilot on 4 March 1995. The meeting got extended, because of which Bedi had to cancel an appointment she had with the Chief Minister Khurana. Pilot gave her the permission, but this irked Khurana, who later exclaimed \"If she thinks we have no importance, then why does she want to work for the Delhi Government?\" While Bedi was in Copenhagen, the prominent farmers' leader Mahendra Singh Tikait was imprisoned in Tihar after a rally, and sought the BJP leaders' help in getting a hookah inside. However, the jail authorities refused to give permission for a hookah, since Bedi had earlier declared Tihar a no-smoking zone.\n\nSubsequently, Delhi's Lieutenant Governor P.K. Dave wrote a letter to the Union Home Secretary K. Padmanabhiah, accusing Bedi of \"manipulating foreign trips\", and leveled other charges against her. Dave accused Bedi of \"compromising\" the prison's security by allowing visitors – including American officials and foreign TV crews – inside the jail, without the Delhi government's permission. Another charge was that she had allowed NHRC representatives to meet TADA detainees from Kashmir, who had raised anti-national slogans. In her defence, Bedi argued that the TADA detainees had gone on a relay hunger strike demanding speedy trials. She also stated that the foreign TV crews had only shot the Vipassana meditation classes, and that she had the right to admit them under the rules. She also pointed out that the Union Government had itself asked her to allow the Americans – Lee P. Brown and Christine Wisner (wife of Frank G. Wisner) – inside the prison.\n\nAnother charge against Bedi was giving undue favours to the notorious criminal Charles Sobhraj. At that time, the \"Delhi Jail Manual\" (written in 1894 and modified in 1988) listed a number of prohibited articles, one of which was a typewriter. However, the manual also gave the jail superintendent the power to allow any of these prohibited items in special cases. Using this power, Bedi permitted Sobhraj the use of an electronic typewriter (Sobhraj had already been given a manual typewriter before Bedi became the officer in-charge). Bedi had also allowed NGOs to start typing classes for prisoners, but Sobhraj claimed that he was using the typewriter to write her biography, which gave the authorities a reason to accuse Bedi of misusing her powers. Khurana also alleged that Sobhraj had been supplied with a pipe and foreign-made cigars, a charge refuted by the testimony of Sobhraj's former cell-mate. The prison manual also had an antiquated rule which stated that \"caught escapees will wear a red cap\". Sobhraj had escaped in 1986, before he was recaptured. Khurana alleged that Bedi had specially exempted him from wearing a red cap. However, a senior jail officer stated that he had never seen the 'red cap' rule being implemented in Tihar. PK Dave and Madan Lal Khurana got Bedi removed as the prisons in-charge on 3 May 1995. When her transfer was announced, the Tihar inmates went on a hunger strike to protest it, while some of the warders celebrated it by distributing sweets. Bedi accused \"unethical politicians\" of \"telling lies, making false allegations and misinforming people\". She alleged that her supervisors in the government had no \"interest, vision or leadership\". She argued that she should not have been transferred on the basis of unverified charges, and demanded an inquiry committee. Rajesh Pilot defended her publicly, but the Union Government did not officially support her. Khushwant Singh described her transfer as \"a victory for a handful of small-minded, envious people over a gutsy woman\".\n\nAfter her removal from Tihar, Bedi was posted as head of training at the police academy on 4 May 1995. Her designation was Additional Commissioner (policy and planning). She served as the Joint Commissioner of Police of Delhi Police. Later, she served as the Special Commissioner (Intelligence) of Delhi Police.\n\nOn 5 April 1999, she was appointed as Inspector-General of Police in Chandigarh. Her mother accompanied her, but soon suffered a stroke and went into coma. Bedi requested a transfer back to Delhi, where her family would be able to take care of her mother. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs transferred her back to Delhi on 15 May. However, her mother died in Delhi three days later, after having been in coma for 41 days.\n\nIn 2003, Bedi became the first woman to be appointed the United Nations civilian police adviser. She worked in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. In 2005, she returned to Delhi after her UN stint. The Delhi Bar Association lobbied to ensure that she didn't get a post that would put her on track to become Delhi's police chief. The lawyers, who had still not forgiven Bedi for the 1988 controversy, wrote to government authorities arguing that Bedi's appointment to a top post might \"unnecessarily create a conflict between the legal fraternity and the police\". She was made the Director General, Home Guards. Before her retirement, she was serving as the Director General of the Bureau of Police Research and Development.\n\nIn 2007, Bedi applied for the post of Delhi Police Commissioner. She was overlooked in favour of Yudhvir Singh Dadwal, who was junior to her, reportedly because the senior bureaucrats saw her as too \"outspoken and radical\". Bedi alleged bias, and stated that her merit had been overlooked. She also proceeded for a three-month 'protest leave', but canceled it later. Journalists like Karan Thapar and Pankaj Vohra criticized her for crying bias, and stated that her service record was tainted with controversies like incomplete Goa, Mizoram and Chandigarh assignments; the lawyers' strike controversy; and the removal from Tihar.\n\nBedi resigned from police service in November 2007, citing personal reasons. She stated that she wanted to focus on academic and social work.\n\nThe Navjyoti Delhi Police Foundation founded by Bedi and her colleagues was renamed to Navjyoti India Foundation in 2007. Since its establishment, the Foundation received strong support from the local communities, as well several Indian and foreign charitable trusts and government bodies. Over next 25 years, it provided residential treatment to nearly 20,000 drug and alcohol addicts. It also started crime prevention programmes such as education of street children and slum kids. It established 200 single-teacher schools, vocational training centers, health care facilities and counselling centers for the vulnerable sections of society. In 2010, it also established the Navjyoti Community College, affiliated to IGNOU.\n\nBedi set up India Vision Foundation (IVF) in 1994. IVF works in fields of police reforms, prison reforms, women empowerment and rural and community development. In police reform area, Bedi emphasized better training, while opposing hazing of trainees. She opposed frequent transfers, stating that these lead to poor cadre management. She also proposed creation of a new level of police administration, which would protect rank-and-file officers from politicians and bureaucrats. In women's rights area, she has advocated equitable educational opportunities and property ownership (including co-ownership) for women. She has emphasized faster empowerment of rural women.\n\nShe is a social commentator and trainer and frequently speaks on various social issues like education, domestic violence & others. During 2008–11, Bedi hosted the reality TV show \"Aap Ki Kachehri\" on STAR Plus. In this court show, Bedi resolved everyday conflicts in a simulated courtroom. In 2008, she launched the website to help people whose complaints are not accepted by the local police. In 2010, she was invited as Speaker in Washington by TEDx.\n\nIn October 2010, Arvind Kejriwal invited Bedi to join him in exposing the CWG scam. Bedi accepted the invitation, and by 2011, the two had allied with other activists, including Anna Hazare, to form India Against Corruption (IAC) group. Their campaign evolved into the 2011 Indian anti-corruption movement. Anna Hazare planned an indefinite hunger strike to demand the passage of a stronger Jan Lokpal Bill in the Indian Parliament. On 16 August 2011, Bedi and other key members of IAC were detained by the police, four hours before the hunger strike could start. Bedi and other activists were released later on the same day. After twelve days of protests and many discussions between the government and the activists, the Parliament passed a resolution to consider three points in drafting of Lokpal bill.\n\nSome members of parliament proposed to bring a breach of privilege motion against Bedi and other activists for allegedly mocking the parliamentarians during the Lokpal bill protests, however they withdrew these notices later.\n\nDuring the anti-corruption movement, Bedi faced controversy when some newspapers questioned discrepancies in her past travel expenses between 2006 and 2011. In 2009, for example, Bedi was invited as the keynote speaker at a conference arranged by Aviation Industry Employees Guild. She accepted the invitation without a speaking fee, but her NGO was to be reimbursed for travel expenses. Bedi's travel agent Flywell, invoiced her hosts business class fare for air tickets, but arranged Bedi to travel in economy class. Between 2006 and 2011, there were several discrepancies in travel-related expense statements, as well as instances where she travelled at no cost to her hosts for a cause. In these cases, Bedi stated she did not personally receive or incur the disputed difference, only India Vision Foundation did, an NGO she headed. In November 2011, the Delhi Police, under directions of the additional chief metropolitan magistrate, registered an FIR – police case for cognizable offense – against Bedi for allegedly misappropriating funds through Indian Vision Foundation and other NGOs. The investigation that followed found no evidence of fraud against her or of siphoning of NGO funds for personal use, and subsequently filed closure of the case.\n\nBedi split from IAC after a faction led by Arvind Kejriwal formed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in 2012. AAP went on to form a short-lived minority government in Delhi with Kejriwal as Chief Minister (CM). During the 2014 Indian general election, Bedi publicly supported Narendra Modi, the prime ministerial candidate of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Kejriwal, on the other hand, contested the election against Modi. After Modi won and became the Prime Minister of India, Bedi stated that she was ready to be BJP's CM candidate in Delhi, if such an offer was made to her. Eight months after Modi's election, she joined BJP in 2015. She was BJP's Chief Minister (CM) candidate for the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections, in which Arvind Kejriwal was AAP's CM candidate. She lost the election from Krishna Nagar constituency to AAP candidate SK Bagga by a margin of 2277 votes, and AAP came to power again with an absolute majority after one year.\n\nOn 22 May 2016, Bedi was appointed as the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry.\n\nDr Kiran Bedi took oath as the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry on 29 May, 2016, and broke conventions by addressing the gathering at the oath taking ceremony. She said she was there \"on a mission to make the Union Territory of Puducherry a Prosperous Puducherry\" and also gave \"the TEA (Trust, Empowerment, Accountability) mantra to officers to work towards this mission.\"\n\nOne of the very first practices she initiated as the Lieutenant Governor was to open the gates of Raj Nivas to the public thereby making it the \"People’s Nivas\". She started an 'open house' process where the public could visit Raj Nivas from Monday to Wednesday at 5 PM to meet the Hon. Lieutenant Governor in person and have their grievances addressed.\nFollowing a complaint in the open house about needing proactive monitoring in the city for certain issues, she personally began to step out on weekend mornings for doing the rounds on a cycle, by walk, by car, or, sometimes, even by bus and other public transport. These rounds have helped in solving sanitation issues, de-siltation of water channels, encouragement of cleanliness, solving garbage issues, and reviving the beaches to mention a few. Her cycle rallies are extremely popular because she personally leads the rallies around the city, meets people, and even rewards them for their good work.\n\nRaj Nivas - as the \"People’s Nivas\" - celebrates nearly every festival in Puducherry with great fervour and pomp in the lawns of the property. From Pongal, Diwali, or Christmas, most of the major festivals are celebrated in Raj Nivas. Raj Nivas also has a dedicated \"visitor hours\" every day from 12 PM to 1 PM where the general public (tourists and locals alike) are allowed to enter and see the French heritage building and to also get an opportunity to meet their outgoing and proactive mega icon and take a picture with her.\nKiran Bedi's fight for justice in the medical admissions case is one of the most important breakthroughs as the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry. She has fought against vested interests and helped in establishing a cap on the fees for deserving students to get medical seats.\n\nOne of the most significant achievements of Dr Kiran Bedi as the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry has been with her project ‘Mission Water Rich Puducherry’. When she heard that the PWD did not have enough funds to de-silt water channels and the drains, she brought in community support in the form of CSR, connected donors with JCB machine contractors, and had the channels de-silted in short notice. Today, this model is being emulated across the country. In 2019, as she celebrated her 70th birthday, she began 'Mission Green Puducherry' by planting saplings along the Kanagan lake in Puducherry. Since then, many students and volunteers have taken this forward by organizing tree planting drives.\n\nAs the Lieutenant Governor, she has further introduced several best practices in Puducherry that are akin to management lessons that were recently outlined by her at the 50th Governors Conference in Delhi. From ensuring financial prudence to bringing in community support to having an open house each of these practices have helped in massive development of Puducherry.\n\nBedi has authored the following works:\n\nKiran Bedi along with three of her sisters were born to the family of Prakash Lal Peshawaria and Prem Lata Peshawaria. Indian-American lawyer Anu Peshawaria is Bedi's younger sister.\n\nShe met her future husband Brij Bedi on tennis courts of Amritsar. Brij, who was nine years older than her, played university-level tennis at the time. On 9 March 1972, the two married at a simple ceremony at the local Shivalaya temple. The two have lived separately for most of their married life. The couple had a daughter in 1975; originally named Sukriti, she later changed her name to Saina.\n\nIn 2005, CUNY School of Law awarded her an honorary Doctor of Law degree in recognition of her \"humanitarian approach to prison reforms and policing\".\n\nThe Navjyoti Delhi Police Foundation received the 1999 Serge Sotiroff Memorial Award for outstanding contributions to international drug control efforts. \n\nShe was conferred with Acharya Tulsi Kartritva Puraskar in 2005 by Akhil Bhartiya Terapanth Mahila Mandal.Akhil Bhartiya Terapanth Mahila Mandal\n\nThe following films, documentaries and TV programmes are based on Bedi's life:\n\n\nBiographies of Bedi include:\nKiran Bedi was featured in National Geographic's Series \"Mega Icons\" (2018), which revolves around the life of her.\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "2213726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213726", "title": "OutRunners", "text": "OutRunners\n\n\"OutRunners\" is the fourth game in the \"Out Run\" series, following \"Battle Out Run\" and \"Turbo Outrun\". After \"Turbo Outrun\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s departure from \"Out Run\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s laid-back, charming atmosphere, fans wanted a game that captured the spirit of the original. \"OutRunners\" succeeded in doing this; it brought back the ability to take different paths through forks in the road, returned to a lighthearted atmosphere, and distanced itself well from the \"serious\" \"Turbo Outrun\". The game featured head-to-head support, and with enough cabinets, up to eight players could challenge each other. It was also the only game in the \"Out Run\" series to feature various selectable cars and multiple endings until \"OutRun 2\". \"OutRunners\" was the most successful game released for Sega's System Multi 32 hardware, and one of the last successful 2D games released by Sega. \"OutRunners\" was also known for having some of the best looking graphics seen at the time, thanks to creative sprite design and a very skillful use of parallax scrolling, similar to that found in Power Drift, released four years earlier. The game holds up very well today, and plays very similarly to a modern polygon based 3D racer, something not common in a racing game that utilises 2D graphics.\n\nSome routes are accessible on more than one route combination like in the original Out Run. After the initial starting stage, the player has the option of either turning east or west. West leads through San Francisco, through the Easter Islands, into Asia and either into Africa or Europe. East goes through the Grand Canyon, South America or Niagara Falls, across the Atlantic Ocean, into Europe and either into Asia or Australia.\n\nAn anthropomorphic broad bean character is featured on billboards and the start of the game called \"Broad Bean,\" a parody of Bibendum (the Michelin man), presumably the mascot of the fictional company sponsoring the race, Sam Spree.\nIn the Mega Drive version, both Sonic and Tails may fly by in a pair of Tornados and sprinkle the Sega logo onto the screen. Sonic can also be seen on various billboards in the first stage.\n\nAll of the selectable cars in \"OutRunners\" are fictional convertibles, but bear resemblance to real automobiles. Notably, the Speed Buster closely resembles the Ferrari Testarossa featured in the original \"OutRun.\" Each car has its own set of a driver and passenger character, and have their own unique ending vignette if the player makes it to a goal. Each character set also has their own way of acting when their car crashes (Flying through the air, bouncing like balls, running after the car, etc.), but unlike their OutRun counterparts, they always land right back in the car and keep going without stopping.\n\n\"OutRunners\" features all four of the songs from the original \"OutRun\" by Hiroshi Kawaguchi, as well as various new tracks composed by Takenobu Mitsuyoshi and Takayuki Nakamura, along with contributions from Kawaguchi.\n\nA port of the game was released for the Mega Drive by Sega and for the Genesis by Data East. It featured a forced split-screen in single player modes, where one screen focused on the player and the other on the AI. Though the graphics were merely an adaptation of the arcade version, all other features of this version were kept intact, such as the original arcade soundtrack featuring four songs from the original \"Outrun\". Andy Dyer wrote in \"Mega\" that it was \"the most embarrassing driving game to appear on the Mega Drive.\"\n\nIn October 1993, Atari Corporation filed a lawsuit against Sega for an alleged infringement of a patent originally created by Atari Corp. in the 1980s, with the former seeking a preliminary injunction to stop manufacturing, usage and sales of hardware and software for both Sega Genesis and Game Gear. On September 28, 1994, both parties reached a settlement in which it involved a cross-licensing agreement to publish up to five titles each year across their systems until 2001. The Genesis version of \"OutRunners\" was one of the first five titles approved from the deal by Sega in order to be converted for the Atari Jaguar, but it was never released.\n\n"}

The novel, written by Charlie Higson, was released in the United Kingdom on 5 January 2006 by Puffin Books.\n\n\"Blood Fever\" begins with a prologue during which a young girl named Amy Goodenough is aboard her father's yacht in the middle of the Mediterranean sea when she becomes witness to a band of pirates under the command of Zoltan the Magyar who board the yacht. Zoltan's men ransack the vessel and in the process murder Amy's father who was unwilling to part with his priceless possessions. When Amy fails to get revenge by throwing a knife at Zoltan and hitting him in the shoulder, she is taken prisoner, but swears she will one day succeed in achieving vengeance.\n\nFollowing the adventure \"SilverFin\", James Bond is back at Eton where he is now a member of a secret risk-taking club known as the Danger Society. As summer vacation looms, James is given the opportunity to go to Sardinia on a field trip with one of his professors, Peter Haight and a colleague, Cooper-ffrench. While there Bond would also be able to visit his cousin, Victor Delacroix (a relation of Monique Delacroix, James deceased mother).\n\nPrior to leaving, Bond learns of the tragedy that took place on the Goodenough's yacht from his friend, Mark Goodenough, Amy's brother who attends Eton. Bond is also witness to a mysterious group whose followers are marked on both of their hands with an 'M' (double M), which James eventually learns is the mark of the Millenaria, a defunct secret Italian society that has had plans throughout history to restore the Roman Empire.\n\nOnce arriving in Sardinia, James and his classmates begin a tour of the country to learn its history, during which Bond is poisoned (though the reader is not aware of it at the time) and almost killed. To get away and relax, Bond departs from his classmates to spend time with his Cousin Victor, his artist friend Poliponi, and his teenage servant Mauro. While there Victor is host to the Count Ugo Carnifex, a man who is later identified as the leader of the reorganized Millenaria that plans once again to restore the glory of the Roman Empire. Carnifex achieves the funding for such a task, as well as for his palace located high in the mountains of Sardinia, and his lavish lifestyle, by hiring pirates such as Zoltan the Magyar to plunder valuable items; however, Carnifex is a fraud who cannot actually afford to compensate his \"employees\". Additionally, when Zoltan arrives at Carnifex's palace, Carnifex declares ownership over Amy Goodenough, much to the great annoyance of Zoltan, whom during his travels to Sardinia had formed a unique and strange bond with Amy.\n\nLater Bond is once again reunited with his classmates who are now in a town near Carnifex's palace. During one night, Bond sneaks into the palace and finds Amy's cell, but is unable to rescue her and instead informs Peter Haight. Things go bad, however, when Haight reveals himself to be a loyal servant of Carnifex and had earlier attempted to poison and kill James for asking too many questions about the Millenaria. Carnifex subsequently tortures James by allowing the mosquitoes to have a field day (Carnifex betting that at some point one of them will be a carrier of malaria while James is stripped of his shirt and strapped down, thus preventing him from escaping, killing any mosquitoes feeding and scratching itches, bringing the pain to a maximum. Bond is later rescued by Mauro's sister, Vendetta, who kisses him consistently.\n\nHaving put up with Carnifex for as long as he could bear, Zoltan turns against Carnifex by flooding his palace leaving it in ruins. Carnifex's sea plane is swept away by the water and flies straight into the count, killing him. Just prior, Bond sneaks into the palace with the help of Vendetta, much to her dismay, to rescue Amy. Vendetta is reluctant to let Bond go and attacks him. Bond convinces her not to follow and, for good measure, he gives her a kiss of his own. After the destruction of the palace, Bond and Amy return to Victor Delacroix's villa, but are ambushed on the way by Peter Haight. Bond and Amy are saved, however, by Zoltan the Magyar who gives his life for their protection in the process. The grief-stricken Amy hugs Bond for comfort.\n\nAmy and Bond arrive at Victor's villa. After skinny dipping and lying on the beach, they go up together. However, Jana Carnifex, Ugo's sister, is waiting for them. Bond tricks her, however, by jumping off the rock, while Victor distracts her. She slips and falls into a bed of sea urchins, where she finally dies from the pain and poison. As Bond and Amy wade to the surface, Amy suddenly steps on a sea urchin. Bond knows exactly how to remove it.\n\n\n\n"}

It was a licence-built version of the British Rail Class 116.\n\nBR Derby was inundated with orders for the Class 116, so the work was put out to tender. All Class 118s were built in Birmingham by Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company.\n\nOriginally allocated to the Western Region, the 118 was extensively used in Devon and Cornwall. They were stabled at Laira depot. The 118s survived in service in the region until 1994 when they were replaced by Class 156s.\n\nIn its final days, vehicles were allocated to Tyseley depot in Birmingham, and were all withdrawn by the end of 1994. Like most first generation DMUs they were originally BR Green, then plain blue, and finally blue and grey, with a few receiving Network SouthEast livery. One set was painted in all over yellow with advertisements for British Telecom.\n\nA normal formation was three vehicles- a Driving Motor Brake Second (DMBS) which had two BUT engines (Later fitted with Leyland), a driving compartment(cab), 65 second class seats, guards accommodation and luggage/parcels space, a Trailer Composite Lavatory (TCL) which had no engines or driving compartment, but had 22 first class seats, 48 second class seats and a lavatory, and a Driving Motor Second (DMS), which like the DMBS had two engines and a driver's cab, and contained 89 second class seats. Having the 'blue square' multiple working system allowed them to run in formations containing up to 12 cars with most of BR's other DMUs.\n\nTwo vehicles were converted to sandite use.\n\nOnly one Class 118 vehicle, DMS Number 51321, has been preserved and is at the Battlefield Line. This vehicle has been paired with class 116 DMBS 51131, also based on the railway.\n\n\n"}

He and Tenzan are also former National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) World Tag Team Champions. Between the NWA, AJPW, and NJPW, Kojima has held 19 total championships.\n\nLike many Japanese wrestlers, Kojima has a background in judo, but he chose not to continue the sport when he went to college. He got his start loading trucks for New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), and after some months of persuasion finally convinced head trainer Animal Hamaguchi to accept him into the dojo.\n\nKojima entered the NJPW Dojo in February 1991. He debuted as a wrestler on his 21st birthday in a match against future tag team partner Hiroyoshi Yamamoto, who would later adopt the stage name of Hiroyoshi Tenzan. In 1994 he defeated Manabu Nakanishi in the Young Lions Cup finals, winning the tournament. In the end of that year he went to Europe, including a spell in Orig Williams' British Wrestling Federation as face-painted Suzuki Karimoto, and returned to NJPW in January 1996. When he returned, he formed The Bull Powers with Nakanishi, who had returned from WCW. In May 1997 he defeated Riki Choshu and Kensuke Sasaki with Nakanishi to become an IWGP Tag Team Champion for the first time. At the end of 1998 he joined nWo Japan, by Keiji Mutoh's leadership. Kojima and Tenzan (known together as Tencozy, a portmanteau of their last names) formed a tag team and ended up holding the IWGP Tag Team title together twice.\n\nOn September 26, 2002, Kojima defeated Jerry Lynn to win the vacant MLW World Heavyweight Championship in New York. Kojima successfully defended the title five times in both MLW and All Japan Pro Wrestling. Kojima held the championship for a then record 267 days, before losing the title to Mike Awesome on June 20, 2003.\n\nIn January 2002, in opposition to Antonio Inoki focusing the IWGP title on unreliable shoot style wrestlers such as Kazuyuki Fujita and Tadao Yasuda, Kojima left NJPW with his mentor Keiji Mutoh, and joined All Japan Pro Wrestling where he was finally able to receive the push of a top star. He held both of the company's tag team titles, the World Tag Team Championship twice. On February 16, 2005, he won the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, AJPW's unified heavyweight championship from Toshiaki Kawada. Only four days later he won NJPW's heavyweight championship, the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, from his former tag team partner Hiroyoshi Tenzan in a cross-promotional double title match. The match had a unique finish designed to fool fans in attendance. The idea was to make it look like the match was going to end in a 60-minute time limit draw. However, with just seconds before the match would be declared a time limit draw, Tenzan, who was known to have a legitimate back injury, could not continue, resulting in Kojima being declared the winner and becoming the new IWGP Heavyweight Champion. NJPW officials had come up with the finish, which was designed to look like a \"mistake\", having agreed with AJPW that it would be better if Kojima won the match, but not wanting the match to end in a standard pinfall or submission. On May 14, 2005, Tenzan won the IWGP title back, but not the Triple Crown.\n\nUpon joining AJPW, Kojima began to use the Great Koji (copying The Great Muta) and Great Kosuke (copying The Great Sasuke) personas for special matches.\n\nOn July 3, 2006, Kojima lost the Triple Crown to Taiyō Kea. Three days later it was revealed that Kojima would return to New Japan to compete in the 2006 G1 Climax, where he would go to lose in the finals against former tag team partner and rival Hiroyoshi Tenzan.\n\nIn October 2006 it was announced that Tencozy would reform for the upcoming World's Strongest Tag Determination League tournament. On December 2, 2006, the reformed Tencozy won the World's Strongest Tag Determination League defeating Kohei Suwama and RO'Z in the finals when Kojima used a lariat on RO'Z. The duo next faced Masahiro Chono and Keiji Mutoh at NJPW's Wrestle Kingdom in Tokyo Dome. They lost when Chono forced Tenzan to submit.\n\nIn July 2007, Kojima shocked the All-Japan Army when he betrayed them and joined the Voodoo Murders, where he was quickly made the group's co-leader along with TARU. Soon after joining, Kojima and TARU won the World Tag Team Championship from Toshiaki Kawada and Taiyō Kea. Kojima left the group in 2008 after returning from injury to side with his sworn friend Hiroyoshi Tenzan and to feud with the alliance of Great Bash Heel (Tenzan's former group) and the VooDoo Murders.\n\nIn 2008, Tenzan and Kojima became the first tag team to ever win G1 Tag League and World's Strongest Tag Determination League in the same year. Later he started his 1st stable named F4 (Friend Fight Fan and Future) with young proteges YAMATO and KAI. A 4th member in Zodiac joined later in 2009. On September 26, 2009 a few days after his 39th birthday Kojima lifted the All-Japan Triple Crown off of Yoshihiro Takayama, returning the titles to All-Japan and winning them for the 2nd time. He lost the title on March 21, 2010 to Ryota Hama.\n\nKojima's AJPW page was taken down soon before he agreed to compete in New Japan Pro Wrestling's 20th annual G1 Climax. It is reported that he was plagued with an arm injury that required surgery and needed time off to heal. AJPW then refused to discuss re-signing Kojima until he was healthy. It has been reported Kojima was not pleased with this and began entertaining other possibilities.\n\nKojima returned to New Japan in August 2010 in order to take part in the 2010 G1 Climax tournament. His return match took place on August 6, 2010, when he teamed up with El Samurai in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Hirooki Goto and Ryusuke Taguchi. In the round robin stage of the tournament Kojima won five out his seven matches and won his block to advance to the finals, where, on August 15, he defeated Hiroshi Tanahashi to win G1 Climax. On October 11 Kojima defeated Togi Makabe to win the IWGP Heavyweight Championship for the second time. On December 11 Kojima made his first successful defense of the title, defeating Shinsuke Nakamura. On December 14 Kojima announced that he was starting his own stable, tentatively named Kojima Office, and named Taichi, who had accompanied him to the ring for his Nakamura match, its first member. Kojima turned heel on December 23, when he hit his number one contender Hiroshi Tanahashi with a lariat after a match, where he and Kota Ibushi had defeated Tanahashi and Prince Devitt. On January 4, 2011, at Wrestle Kingdom V in Tokyo Dome, Kojima lost the IWGP Heavyweight Championship to Tanahashi. On January 30 Kojima defeated Togi Makabe to earn a rematch with Tanahashi. Meanwhile, the newly renamed Kojima-gun expanded to include Taka Michinoku and Nosawa Rongai, who in turn used his connections to get MVP to also join the group. Kojima received his rematch for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship on February 20 at The New Beginning, but was again defeated by Tanahashi. After Kojima was defeated by Togi Makabe on May 3, Taichi and Taka Michinoku turned on him and named the returning Minoru Suzuki as their new leader, while Kojima himself formed a new partnership with Makabe and MVP, who left the stable after Suzuki took over. On July 18, Suzuki defeated Kojima in a singles match. The two had a rematch on August 1 during the first day of the 2011 G1 Climax, where Kojima managed to pick up the win. Kojima managed to win five more matches in the tournament, but a loss to former partner Hiroyoshi Tenzan on the final day eliminated him from the running for a spot in the finals. After the tournament Kojima was sidelined indefinitely with an eye injury suffered during the match with Tenzan.\n\nOn September 19, it was announced that Kojima had signed a contract with New Japan to become an official member of the promotion's roster. Kojima then announced that he would make his return on October 10 at Destruction '11 and challenged former partner Hiroyoshi Tenzan to be his opponent that day. Kojima would end up defeating Tenzan in his return match. In the 2011 G1 Tag League, Kojima teamed with Togi Makabe as the \"Beast Combination\". After picking up three wins and one loss in their first four matches, Kojima and Makabe were defeated by the Billion Powers (Hirooki Goto and Hiroshi Tanahashi) on November 4, causing them to narrowly miss advancing to the semifinals of the tournament. Kojima and Tenzan faced each other yet again on November 12 in a match, which was won by Tenzan. Afterwards, the former tag team partners came together to fend off an attack from CHAOS. Tencozy wrestled their return match as a tag team on December 4, defeating CHAOS members Hideo Saito and Takashi Iizuka. On January 4, 2012, at Wrestle Kingdom VI in Tokyo Dome, Kojima and Tenzan defeated Bad Intentions (Giant Bernard and Karl Anderson) to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship for the third time. On May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2012, Kojima and Tenzan lost the title to Takashi Iizuka and Toru Yano in their third defense. On July 22, Kojima and Tenzan defeated Iizuka and Yano in a decision match to regain the newly vacated title. On October 8 at King of Pro-Wrestling, Kojima and Tenzan lost the title to K.E.S. (Davey Boy Smith, Jr. and Lance Archer). From November 20 to December 1, Tencozy took part in the round-robin portion of the 2012 World Tag League. The team finished with a record of four wins and two losses, winning their block and advancing to the semifinals of the tournament. On December 2, Tencozy was eliminated from the tournament in their semifinal match by Sword & Guns (Hirooki Goto and Karl Anderson). On December 9, Kojima made a rare appearance for Pro Wrestling Noah, unsuccessfully challenging Takeshi Morishima for the GHC Heavyweight Championship. On April 7, 2013, Kojima unsuccessfully challenged visiting Rob Conway for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at New Japan's Invasion Attack event. On May 3, Tencozy regained the IWGP Tag Team Championship from K.E.S. in a four-way match, which also included Takashi Iizuka and Toru Yano, and Manabu Nakanishi and Strong Man, starting Kojima's sixth reign as champion. From August 1 to 11, Kojima took part in the 2013 G1 Climax. where he finished second to last in his block with a record of four wins and five losses. However, a victory over reigning IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada on the final day of the tournament earned Kojima a shot at the title. The title match between the two took place on September 29 at Destruction and saw Okada retain his title. Following the match, Kojima was sidelined with a dislocated shoulder and was expected to miss two months of in-ring action. Kojima returned to the ring on November 9 at Power Struggle, where he and Tenzan lost the IWGP Tag Team Championship back to K.E.S. in a three-way match, which also included The IronGodz (Jax Dane and Rob Conway). In December, Tencozy made it to the finals of the 2013 World Tag League, defeating K.E.S. in the semifinals, before losing to Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson.\nDuring the tournament, Kojima pinned Rob Conway, which led to him challenging him to a rematch for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On January 4, 2014, at Wrestle Kingdom 8 in Tokyo Dome, Kojima defeated Conway to become the new NWA World Heavyweight Champion. The following day, Tencozy unsuccessfully challenged The IronGodz for the NWA World Tag Team Championship with Conway pinning Kojima following a low blow. On February 9 at The New Beginning in Hiroshima, Kojima made his first successful defense of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Big Daddy Yum-Yum. Two days later at The New Beginning in Osaka, Tencozy defeated Yum-Yum and Michael Tarver to earn another shot at the NWA World Tag Team Championship. On April 6 at Invasion Attack 2014, Tencozy defeated The IronGodz to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship. Six days later, during New Japan's trip to Taiwan, Kojima made his second successful defense of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Rob Conway. The following day, Tencozy also successfully defended the NWA World Tag Team Championship against The IronGodz. On May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2014, Kojima defeated Wes Brisco for his third successful defense of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On May 25 at Back to the Yokohama Arena, Tencozy successfully defended the NWA World Tag Team Championship against Brisco and Conway and K.E.S. in a three-way match. The following week, Kojima returned to the United States to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. After successful defenses against Jeremiah Plunkett, Damien Wayne and Houston Carson, Kojima lost the title back to Rob Conway on June 2 in Las Vegas. Upon his return to Japan, Kojima and Tenzan successfully defended the NWA World Tag Team Championship against K.E.S. on June 21 at Dominion 6.21. After four successful title defenses, they lost the title to K.E.S. in a rematch on October 13 at King of Pro-Wrestling. The following month, Tencozy took part in the 2014 World Tag League, where they finished with a record of four wins and three losses, failing to advance to the finals. In late 2014, Kojima began making appearances for Pro Wrestling Noah, which culminated in him unsuccessfully challenging Naomichi Marufuji for the GHC Heavyweight Championship on January 10, 2015. On March 21, Kojima unsuccessfully challenged Hiroyoshi Tenzan for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. From July 23 to August 15, Kojima took part in the 2015 G1 Climax, where he finished with a record of three wins and six losses. On March 19, 2016, Kojma unsuccessfully challenged Katsuyori Shibata for the NEVER Openweight Championship.\n\nOn July 3, Kojima teamed up with Matt Sydal and Ricochet to defeat The Elite (Kenny Omega and The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson)) for the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship.

{"id": "2213751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213751", "title": "Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik", "text": "Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik\n\nMaslama ibn Abd al-Malik (, in Greek sources , \"Masalmas\"; – 24 December 738) was an Umayyad prince and one of the most prominent Arab generals of the early decades of the 8th century, leading several campaigns against the Byzantine Empire and the Khazar Khaganate. He achieved great fame especially for leading the second and last Arab siege of the Byzantine capital Constantinople.\n\nMaslama was the son of the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan () and half-brother of the caliphs al-Walid I (), Sulayman (), Yazid II () and Hisham (). Maslama himself was excluded from the line of succession as his mother was a slave concubine. To affirm the reconciliation with Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi, the rebel Qaysi leader of al-Qarqisiya, in the summer of 691, Abd al-Malik arranged for a marriage contract between Maslama and Zufar's daughter al-Rabab.\n\nMaslama is first mentioned as leading, along with his nephew al-'Abbas ibn al-Walid, the annual summer campaign (\"ṣawā'if\") against the Byzantine Empire in 705. His first major expedition was the 707–708 campaign against the Byzantine city of Tyana in southeastern Asia Minor, which was launched in retaliation for the defeat and death of the distinguished general Maimun the Mardaite the year before. The siege lasted through winter and the Arab army faced great hardship, but after the Arabs defeated a Byzantine relief force in spring 708, the city surrendered. A few months later, in the summer, Maslama led another expedition into Asia Minor and defeated a Byzantine army near Amorium, while in 709 he raided into the region of Isauria.\n\nIn the same year, Maslama was appointed military governor of Armenia and Adharbayjan, succeeding his uncle Muhammad ibn Marwan. This he added to the post of governor of Jund Qinnasrin in northern Syria, which he already held. His governorship of Jund Qinnasrin was not as well-documented by early Arabic chroniclers as his other posts, although historian Jere L. Bacharach claims Maslama was the likely patron of the Umayyad Mosque of Aleppo and possibly responsible for some construction works in Qinnasrin. Together, command of these provinces effectively gave him complete control of the Caliphate's entire northwestern border. From this position he launched several campaigns against the Byzantines, devastating Galatia and sacking Amaseia in 712, and taking Melitene in 714. He was also the first to establish the Caliphate's presence north of the Caucasus, leading to the commencement of direct conflict with the Khazars (the Second Arab–Khazar War). In 710, he marched his army up to Bab al-Abwab (\"Gate of Gates\", the Arabic name of Derbent), which he took and destroyed during a second expedition in 714.\n\nFrom 715 Maslama was the leading general in the plans of his brother, Caliph Sulayman, to conquer the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, as Sulayman himself was too ill to lead the campaign in person. Maslama led a huge army, which sources report to have numbered 120,000 men and 1,800 ships. In late 715, the Arab vanguard crossed the Taurus Mountains into Byzantine territory, Maslama following in spring 716 with the main army and the fleet. The Arabs' plans were aided by the recurrence of civil strife, which had plagued the Byzantines since 695; Emperor Anastasius II was overthrown by Theodosius III in 715, who was in turn opposed by the \"strategos\" of the Anatolic Theme, Leo the Isaurian. Maslama hoped to use the divisions among the Byzantines for his own benefit and initiated contacts with Leo, but the latter used the negotiations to outwit the Arab general and occupied for himself the strategic city of Amorium, which Maslama had intended to use as his winter base. As a result, Maslama marched further west, to the coastlands of the Thracesian Theme. There he spent the winter, while Leo marched against Theodosius in Constantinople, which he entered in March 717.\n\nIn early summer 717, Maslama with his army crossed from Asia into Europe over the Dardanelles, and proceeded to besiege Constantinople from land and sea. His navy, however, was soon neutralized by the use of Greek fire, and as his army was unable to overcome the city's land defences, the siege continued into the winter, which was especially severe that year, with snow covering the ground for three months. Maslama had brought along many supplies, but they either soon ran out or were lost—Arab accounts make much of Leo tricking the Arab general yet again during negotiations into handing over or destroying a significant part of his hoarded supplies—and the army began to suffer from hunger and disease. In spring, reinforcements arrived in the form of two large fleets from Egypt and Ifriqiya, but a large part of their crews, who were mostly conscripted Christians, went over to the Byzantines, and Leo's navy managed to destroy or capture the Arab fleets. The Byzantines also defeated an Arab army marching to aid the besiegers through Asia Minor, while Maslama's men had to contend with attacks by the Bulgars as well, which cost them many men. The siege had clearly failed, and the new Caliph, Umar II (), ordered Maslama to retreat. On 15 August 718, after thirteen months of siege, the Arabs departed.\n\nAfter his failure at Constantinople, Maslama was dispatched to Iraq to quell the Kharijites. Following Umar's death and the accession of his brother Yazid II in 720, he was tasked with the suppression of the revolt of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, whom he defeated and killed in August 720. He nevertheless fell out of favour with the Caliph, who resented and feared his power as governor of both Iraqs, as well as his interfering in the succession: Maslama favoured his brother Hisham over Yazid's son Walid. Yazid soon recalled Maslama from his post, ostensibly because he had failed to deliver his provinces' tax haul to Damascus, and replaced him by his protege, Umar ibn Hubayra.\nMaslama then disappears from the sources and re-emerges in 725, shortly after Yazid's death and the accession of Hisham, who sent Maslama to replace al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami in the Caucasus front against the Khazars. Initially, however, Maslama was mostly active in the Byzantine front, and the war against the Khazars was delegated to al-Harith ibn Amr al-Ta'i. In winter 725, Maslama led an expedition against Asia Minor from Melitene, which culminated in the sack of Caesarea on 13 January 726. Along with the capture of Gangra by Abdallah al-Battal in 727, this was one of the major successes of Arab arms against the Byzantines in the 720s. A few months later, he also led the otherwise unremarkable northern summer expedition into Byzantine territory. In 727–728, his attention was diverted by Khazar attacks which reached deep into Adharbayjan. Although Maslama was able to drive them back and recover control of the Darial Pass, his 728 campaign across the Caucasus was difficult, bloody and indecisive. Maslama's troops were reportedly engaged in up to thirty or forty days of constant fighting in miserable weather, and although he claimed victory in a battle over the Khazar \"khagan\" himself, the expedition did not achieve any results, and came close to being defeated. Certainly it did little to stop Khazar attacks south of the Caucasus, which resumed in 729. Maslama was removed from office in the same year, and replaced by al-Jarrah. He is then recorded by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor as having been responsible for the sack of the fortress of Charsianon in late 730, but Arab sources credit Mu'awiya ibn Hisham for this act.\nIn the Caucasus, the situation quickly deteriorated after Maslama's departure. While al-Jarrah campaigned north of the Caucasus, the Khazars swung behind him and attacked his main base, Ardabil. Hastening to relieve the city, al-Jarrah was defeated and killed, and his army practically annihilated in a battle outside the city on 9 December 730. Faced with this crisis, the Caliph appointed Maslama as the new governor of Armenia and Adharbayjan but, in the meantime, the veteran general Sa'id ibn Amr al-Harashi managed to recover the situation and defeat the Khazar army. Maslama, allegedly out of jealousy for Sa'id's successes, had Sa'id imprisoned until Hisham ordered his release. Throughout 730 and 731 Maslama, with a large army at his disposal, cleared the provinces south of the Caucasus of the Khazars, and then advanced beyond the mountains, sacking a couple of settlements and defeating the \"khagan\" in pitched battle. He also recovered the strategic fortress of Bab al-Abwab from the Khazars who had occupied it by poisoning its water supply, and reorganized it as a military colony (\"misr\"), resettling it with 24,000 soldiers. His tenure however was evidently judged as not successful enough, and he was replaced on 3 March 732 by Marwan ibn Muhammad.\n\nMaslama thereafter retired from public life, possibly to his extensive estates in northern Syria. He died on 24 December 738.\n\nAs the commander of the great assault on Constantinople and the \"founder of Islamic Derbent\", for over twenty years in the early 9th century, Maslama was \"one of the principal props of Umayyad power and a foremost actor on the stage of the East\", according to Douglas M. Dunlop. His fame spread far and wide in the Muslim world, and his exploits and chivalry passed into legend.\n\nMaslama's attempt to capture Constantinople in particular became celebrated in later Muslim literature, with several surviving accounts, mostly semi-fictional, in which the historical defeat was transformed into a sort of victory: Maslama was said to have departed only after symbolically entering the Byzantine capital on his horse accompanied by thirty riders; Leo received him with honour and led him to the Hagia Sophia, where the emperor paid homage to the Arab general. The tales of the siege influenced similar episodes in Arabic epic literature, where Maslama appears associated with Abdallah al-Battal, another legendary Arab hero of the wars against Byzantium. His campaign against Constantinople in particular continued to provide inspiration to later Muslim authors, from the \"Muhadarat al-Abrar\" ascribed to the 13th-century Andalusian mystic Ibn Arabi, to the \"khamsa\" of the 17th-century Ottoman poet Nargisi.\n\nFurthermore, Byzantine tradition, as recorded in the 10th-century \"De Administrando Imperio\", held that during the siege Maslama convinced the Byzantines to build Constantinople's first mosque, near the city's \"praetorium\". In reality, the mosque near the \"praetorium\" was most likely erected in about 860, as a result of an Arab embassy in that year. It survived down to the sack of the city by the Fourth Crusade. Later Ottoman tradition also ascribed the building of the Arap Mosque (located outside Constantinople proper in Galata) to Maslama, although it erroneously dated this to around 686, probably confusing Maslama's attack with the first Arab siege in the 670s.\n\n"}

He was also given the responsibility as inspector general in Zone of Communications from November 1917 to February 1918. Alexander was promoted to brigadier general in February 1918 and then to Major General on August 1918.\n\nFrom the Headquarters of the 77th Division in France, Alexander was one of the officers who reported on the Lost Battalion Incident. A group of around 500 soldiers, in nine companies, had disappeared after going into the Argonne Forest expecting American and French Allied troops to meet them. This had followed an American attack on German forces and, with Major Charles White Whittlesey leading the group, the men found that the French troops had been stalled. As a result, the battalion was cut off by the Germans who surprised them and suffered large losses with only 197 men coming out of the ravine. In the report he states:\n\nIn France, he commanded the 41st Infantry Division, 63rd Infantry Brigade, and 77th Infantry Division.\n\nAfter the war, he returned to the rank of colonel and commanded the 3rd Field Artillery Brigade.\n\nIn 1919, Alexander received the honorary degree of LL.D. from St. John's College of Annapolis, Maryland.\n\nHe retired in 1927 at the rank of major general.\n\nHe authored a memoir, 1931's \"Memories of the World War, 1917–1918\".

Thomas in 1892. Together, they had two sons: William Dennison (1893–1978) and Robert (1900–1979). William Dennison became a colonel and Robert Jr. became a lieutenant colonel of the United States Army and died within one year of each other.\n\nHe died in Manhattan on August 25, 1941.

Since every open set is almost open (the empty set is meager), it follows that every Borel set is almost open.\n\nIf a subset of a Polish space has the property of Baire, then its corresponding Banach–Mazur game is determined. The converse does not hold; however, if every game in a given adequate pointclass Γ is determined, then every set in Γ has the property of Baire.

Her music is a mix of pop, cabaret, jazz, and chanson.\n\nSince the appearance of her 1988 debut album, \"Mademoiselle chante...\", Kaas has sold over 17 million records worldwide. She had her greatest success in Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Canada, Russia, Finland, Ukraine, and South Korea with her third album \"Je te dis vous\". In 2002, Kaas made her film debut in \"And Now... Ladies and Gentlemen\" with Jeremy Irons. She represented France in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow, and finished in eighth place.\n\nPatricia Kaas was born as the youngest of her family on 5 December 1966 in Forbach, Lorraine, France, near the German border. Her father, Joseph Kaas (a miner), was a French Germanophone and her mother, Irmgard, was a German from Saar. Kaas grew up in Stiring-Wendel, between Forbach and Saarbrücken on the French side of the border. Until the age of six she spoke only Lorraine Franconian. Her mother encouraged Kaas to become a singer at a very young age. At the age of eight Kaas was already singing songs by Sylvie Vartan, Dalida, Claude François and Mireille Mathieu, but also English-language songs such as \"New York, New York\", at various small events; among others the marriage of her brother. Her first great success came when she received first place at a pop song contest.\n\nKaas took her first step into the professional music business at the age of 13, when, with the help of her brother Egon, she signed a contract with the Saarbrücken club \"Rumpelkammer\". Kaas took the name \"Pady Pax\"—after Pax Majorettes, a brass band from Stiring-Wendel, of which she and her sister Carine were members—and for seven years appeared with the band Dob's Lady Killers. At 16, she took a placement with a model agency in Metz. Her first attempts to break into the music business failed; a producer rejected her on the ground that the world did not need a second Mireille Mathieu. Kaas' producer at this time was the architect Bernard Schwartz.\n\nIn 1985, Kaas was sponsored by the French actor Gérard Depardieu at the age of 19. Schwartz saw her singing at the Rumpelkammer in Saarbrücken and introduced her to the songwriter François Bernheim. Bernheim worked with her and convinced Depardieu to produce her music. \n\nDepardieu produced Kaas' first single \"Jalouse\" (Eng: \"Jealous\"), written by Bernheim and Depardieu's wife Elisabeth. The single was published by EMI, but was a flop. Nonetheless, her encounter with Depardieu was one of the most important events in the beginning of Kaas' artistic career.\n\nThrough \"Jalouse\" and Bernheim the French songwriter Didier Barbelivien became aware of Kaas. His song \"Mademoiselle chante le blues\" (Eng: \"Lady sings the blues\") was the singer's first big hit. The single was published in 1987 by Polydor, and reached 7th place in the French singles chart. The next year Kaas' second single \"D'Allemagne\" (Eng: \"From Germany\") was recorded, written by Barbelivien and Bernheim.\n\nShortly afterwards Kaas' first album \"Mademoiselle chante...\" was produced. It reached 2nd place in the French album charts and stayed there for two months, remaining in the Top 10 for 64 weeks and 118 weeks in the top 100. Shortly after its appearance the album went gold in France (over 100,000 sold) and after three months it went platinum (over 350,000 sold). The album also went platinum in Belgium and Switzerland, and gold in Canada. In the same year Kaas won Victoires de la Musique in the category of \"Discovery of the Year\", one of the most important French music awards.\n\nIn 1989, Kaas suffered a traumatic personal experience when her mother fell ill from cancer and died. The teddy bear Kaas sent to support her mother's convalescence today accompanies Kaas everywhere as a mascot.\n\nIn 1990, Kaas began her first world tour which lasted 16 months in total. She sang in front of about 750,000 fans in over 196 concerts in 12 countries. Among others, Kaas sang daily for a week at the Olympia and Zenith, one of the most famous concert halls in Paris. The concerts were sold out four months before they began. Kaas also gave other successful concerts in New York and Washington D.C. in the U.S. At the end of the tour, \"Mademoiselle chante...\" had sold 1 million copies in France alone and had achieved diamond status. Kaas received the Goldene Europa, one of the biggest German music awards.\n\nIn 1990, Kaas moved from her former record company Polydor to CBS/Sony. Cyril Prieur and Richard Walter of the firm \"Talent Sorcier\" from Paris replaced Bernard Schwartz to become her managers in 1987. Prieur and Walter contributed significantly to the singer's success, in return for which Kaas referred to them as her \"family\".\n\nWith a new record company, she produced \"Scène de vie\" (Eng: \"The Stage of Life\") in 1990. It reached the top of the French charts and stayed there for 10 weeks, going diamond in the process as \"Mademoiselle chante...\" had done before it. With the song \"Kennedy Rose\" Kaas again worked with Elisabeth Depardieu and François Bernheim; this collaboration was more successful than \"Jalouse\", reaching 34th place in the French singles charts. The song was dedicated to Rose Kennedy, matriarch of the Kennedy clan and mother of former U.S. president John F. Kennedy.\n\nWhile on the \"Scène de vie\" tour, the singer performed 210 concerts before 650,000 spectators in 13 countries, among them Japan, Canada and the USSR, where she sang in Moscow and Leningrad. At the end of 1991 her first live album \"Carnets de scène\" (Eng: \"Stage Notebooks\") appeared, which achieved popularity beyond her dedicated fans. 13 years later Sony also published the album as a live DVD.\n\nIn 1991, Kaas received two further awards, the World Music Award and a Bambi. In the following year she received 3rd place in the category of 'Best International Female Singer' at the ECHO awards in Cologne, nominated alongside Cher (who received first place), Tina Turner, Madonna and Whitney Houston, four of the biggest names in the music business.\n\nKaas' 1993 album \"Je te dis vous\" (Eng.: \"I address you formally\") was her definitive breakthrough in the international music scene, selling 3 million copies in 47 countries. It was produced in Pete Townshend's \"Eel Pie Studio\" in London, England by Robin Millar, who had already worked for Sade and the Fine Young Cannibals. In the U.S. and United Kingdom it appeared under the name of \"Tour de charme\" (not to be confused with the live album of the same name). On the album Kaas sang her first song in German: the song \"Ganz und gar\" (Eng: \"Absolutely\") came from the pen of the German singer and songwriter Marius Müller-Westernhagen. The album also featured three tracks in English, including a cover of the James Brown number \"It's A Man's World\". The British rock musician Chris Rea accompanied Kaas on the tracks \"Out Of The Rain\" and \"Ceux qui n'ont rien\" (Eng: \"Those who have nothing\") on guitar.\n\n\"Je te dis vous\" is currently Kaas' most successful album in the German-speaking world, only just missing out on the German top 10 (it spent 2 weeks at 11th place), but spending 36 weeks in the top 100. In Switzerland Kaas reached 2nd place in the album charts, and in France 1st. It was her third album to go diamond, 11 months after its appearance. With the single \"Il me dit que je suis belle\" (Eng: \"He tells me I'm beautiful\") by Sam Brewski (aka Jean-Jacques Goldman) Kaas achieved her second top five single in France. A remix of \"Reste sur moi\" (Eng: \"Stay on me\") reached the top 20 of the US dance charts.\n\nThe following world tour covered 19 countries. Among others she was the first western singer to appear in Hanoi, Vietnam after the Vietnam War, and she also toured in Cambodia, Japan, Korea and Thailand. During the tour she also gave a benefit concert in Chernobyl in front of 30,000 spectators. In total her audience counted 750,000 in 150 concerts. In 1994 her second live album \"Tour de charme\" (Eng: \"A tour with charm\") was published, which, like \"Carnets de scène\", was remade as a live DVD in 2004.\n\nThe LP was released as \"Tour de Charme\" (not to be mistaken with her second live album) in the USA (on 17th of August 1993) and the United-Kingdom, and shows a slightly different track-listing:\n\nIn the middle of the 1990s the album \"Black Coffee\" was produced, an enigma in Kaas' career. In 1995 it was decided to produce a work specially for the American market containing exclusively English lyrics. Rumours state that the album was never officially sold. It occasionally becomes available in on-line auctions, however, but the authenticity of these records is in doubt.\n\nThe title track of the album is a cover version of the Billie Holiday song of the same name and was likewise published by Kaas on the 1997 sampler \"Jazz à Saint-Germain\" (release by Virgin). Other cover versions on the album include classics such as the Bill Withers number \"Ain't No Sunshine\" (which was taken for advertisement music for the Club Mediterranée) from 1971 and \"If You Leave Me Now\" by Chicago from 1976.\n\nIn 1997 \"Dans ma chair\" (Eng: \"In my flesh\") was made. It was produced in New York by Kaas and Phil Ramone, who had previously worked with Ray Charles, Billy Joel and Paul Simon. The album marked the second time the singer officially worked with the French songwriter Jean-Jacques Goldman (they began to work together in 1993 for the song \"Il me dit que je suis belle\".) The collaboration with Goldman, which continues to this day, was one of the most important of Kaas' career.\n\nFurther contributors to the success of the album were the American songwriter and singer Lyle Lovett, with the song \"Chanson simple\" (Eng: \"Simple song\"), and James Taylor with \"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight\", on which he duetted with Kaas. The track \"Quand j'ai peur de tout\" (Eng: \"When I'm afraid of everything\"), written by Diane Warren, was later remade in 2003 by the band Sugababes under the name \"Too Lost in You\".\n\nIn 1998, following the \"Dans ma chair\" tour, the live album and video cassette (later a DVD) \"Rendez-vous\" was produced. Among the tracks are \"L'aigle noir\" (Eng: \"The black eagle\") by the French singer and songwriter Barbara, whom Kaas had admired for a long time.\n\nIn December 1998 Kaas sang with the tenors Plácido Domingo and Alejandro Fernández in the Guildhall of Vienna, Austria. The three were accompanied by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. The concert was made into a CD and DVD in 1999 as \"Christmas In Vienna Vol. VI\".\n\nIn 1999 \"Le mot de passe\" (Eng: \"The password\") was produced by Pascal Obispo, on which Kaas was accompanied by an orchestra on several tracks. Jean-Jacques Goldman again contributed to the making of the studio album, among others with 2 songs \"Une fille de 'l'Est\" (Eng: \"A girl from the East\") in which Kaas praised her East French heritage and \"Les chansons commencent\". The French singer Zazie wrote the track \"J'attends de nous\". The song \"Les éternelles\" (Eng: \"The eternals\") was also published in Germany as a duet with the Swiss tenor Erkan Aki under the title of \"Unter der Haut\" (Eng: \"Under the skin\"), and was the theme music of the five-part ZDF serial \"Sturmzeit\" (Eng: \"Stormy Times\"), based on a book by Charlotte Link.\n\nIn June 1999 Kaas appeared at the benefit concert \"Michael Jackson & Friends\" in Seoul, South Korea and Munich. Apart from Kaas and Jackson, Mariah Carey, Luther Vandross and Status Quo also put in appearances. The special events, in aid of UNESCO, the Red Cross and the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, were broadcast to 39 countries.\n\nIn September 1999, Kaas came third in \"Marianne\", a poll for the national symbol of France, behind supermodels Laetitia Casta (first) and Estelle Hallyday (second). Most pictures of Kaas from her last albums (from \"Dans ma chair\" to \"Sexe fort\" in 2003) show the singer in very figure-accentuating clothes and suitably daring poses, and her music videos are seldom restrained performances.\n\nOn the \"Le mot de passe\" tour Kaas was accompanied at some concerts in Germany and Switzerland by the \"Hannover Pops Orchestra\" of Norddeutscher Rundfunk under the conductor's baton of George Pehlivanian. With this ensemble she was the star guest at, among others, the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival of 1999. The concert of 24 July 1999 at the Guildhall Market of Hamburg was broadcast live on the German-French television station Arte. The orchestra can be heard on the 2000 live album \"Ce sera nous\", but is nowhere to be seen on the live DVD.\n\nIn 2000 an elaborately produced box set was published, which contained almost all the previous studio albums published by Sony and a comprehensive booklet with numerous pictures. In October 2000 Kaas received the Adenauer-de Gaulle Prize in Berlin.\n\nIn April 2001 Kaas gave a concert before 50,000 spectators on the occasion of Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg's accession from his father Jean. Kaas was again accompanied by a large orchestra, on this occasion the Luxembourg Philharmonic. In the same year Kaas began her acting career with \"And now... Ladies and Gentlemen\" with Jeremy Irons, directed by Claude Lelouch, her record company published the greatest hits album \"Rien ne s'arrête\" (Eng: \"Nothing stops\"). As it was a greatest hits, only the title track was new.\n\nIn 2000, Kaas decided to live in Zürich, Switzerland from then on. This also had consequences for her management, which likewise moved from Paris to Zürich and renamed itself \"International Talent Consulting\". Cyril Prieur and Richard Walter remained by Kaas' side.\n\nTo accompany the film the concept album \"Piano Bar By Patricia Kaas\" was released in 2002. While not a soundtrack to the film, some songs performed from the film were included on the album in slightly different versions, making up a sort of concept album that was inspired by the movie. The real soundtrack has never been released. \"Piano Bar...\" was Kaas' first published album that was sung mainly in English, and is a homage to the great French chanson artists of history. It includes cover versions of \"Where Do I Begin\" (originally on the soundtrack to \"Love Story\") and an English version of Jacques Brel's \"Ne me quitte pas\" (Eng: \"Don't leave me\"), here named \"If You Go Away\". The album in France reached 10th place in the charts, but it was the second most successful of Kaas' albums in Germany, reaching 12 place. In 2002 Kaas again received the Golden Europa.\n\nThe \"Piano Bar Live\" tour began in September 2002 in France and lasted until April 2003. It included six sell-out concerts in the US, including appearances in Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Detroit, as well as at the Beacon Theater in Broadway, New York before 6,000 fans. Despite the intensive efforts of Kaas' fans the tour has not been published as a live album.\n\nOn 1 December 2003 released the album \"Sexe fort\" (Eng: \"Strong gender\"), reaching the 9th place in France. Again Jean-Jacques Goldman contributed with \"C'est la faute à la vie\" (Eng: \"It's the fault of life\") and \"On pourrait\" (Eng: \"We could\"), which he also produced himself, just as Pascal Obispo, the producer of \"Le mot de passe\", did with \"L'Abbé Caillou\" (Eng: \"The Abbot Caillou\"). Kaas sang \"On pourrait\" as a duet with the Swiss singer Stephan Eicher.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Sexe fort\" Kaas received a particular distinction on 8 December 2003 when she received the First Class Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for her contribution to friendship between France and Germany, an honour that until then had been awarded to only a few international artists.\n\nUntil the end of 2005 Kaas was on what was now her seventh world tour. In total she performed in 25 countries, including further performances in China and Russia. In all she gave 175 concerts before more than 500,000 spectators. Despite the relative failure of \"Sexe fort\" the tour was a huge success.\n\nAfter the end of the \"Sexe fort\" tour in November 2005, Kaas took a break until the beginning of 2008, interrupted by only a few live performances. In February 2008, Kaas released the song \"Ne pozvonish\"' (You Will Not Call) with the Russian rock group \"Uma2rman\", which was a big hit in Russia.\n\nThe new double album, \"Kabaret\", was released on 30 March 2009. To support her new album, Kaas gave concerts in France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Finland, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Romania and other countries during her \"Kabaret\" tour. Kaas is claimed to be the first international artist to visit 28 Russian cities. The entire tour included at least 170 dates.\n\nOn 28 January 2009 it was confirmed that Kaas would represent France in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow, Russia. Kaas' fans took part in an online poll in several countries where they selected their favourite song from her \"Kabaret\" album. The song Et s'il fallait le faire (And if it had to be done) received a clear majority of the votes and was then chosen as the lead single and also as the French entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 where on 16 May 2009 she finished in 8th place.\nThe song has received positive reviews in several newspapers and polls and a clear majority of 62% of all voters in a questionnaire believed in her chances to win the competition.\n\nIn 2011, Kaas’ autobiography “L’Ombre de ma Voix” (The Shadow of My Voice) was published in March by Flammarion. This bestseller is sold throughout Europe, and has already been translated into more than 6 languages.\n\n“Kaas chante Piaf“ (“Kaas sings Piaf”) is Patricia Kaas' new project, focusing on twenty-one of the great Edith Piaf's iconic titles, arranged by Abel Korzeniowski. This show, commemorating 50 years since the death of Piaf, will open at some of the world’s most prestigious venues, like the Royal Albert Hall in London, Carnegie Hall in New-York, Olympia in Paris, Operetta Theatre in Moscow, and Sejong Cultural Center in Seoul. Although designed primarily as a live show, “Kaas chante Piaf“ is also released as an album. \n\n\nIn 1993 Kaas was offered a role in the Claude Berri film \"Germinal\", but at the time she was working on her third album \"Je te dis vous\". In 1994 Kaas was offered the main role in the film \"Falling In Love Again\" by the American director Stanley Donen. Kaas needed no better model than the German-American singer and actress Marlene Dietrich, whose song \"Lili Marleen\" she had often sung as a child. However, the project foundered due to financial problems.\n\nHer first successful encounter with the film industry remained in the field of singing, when she sang the title song to the 1995 film \"Les Misérables\", based on the novel of the same name by Victor Hugo and directed by Frenchman Claude Lelouch. Her earlier hit \"Il me dit que suis belle\" from the 1993 album \"Je te dis vous\" was also used by Bertrand Tavernier in his film \"L'appât\" (Eng: \"The bait\").\n\nKaas had her acting debut in 2001, when she played the jazz singer Jane beside Jeremy Irons in Claude Lelouch's \"And now... Ladies and Gentlemen\". The film was shown at the Cannes Film Festival among others. In Germany the film was first seen in October 2002 at \"19 Days of French Film\" in Tübingen, but only came to German cinemas in 2003. The film, however, fared poorly at the box office.\n\nPatricia Kaas played the role of a woman wounded by life for the television production “Assassinée” (Murdered), by Thierry Binisti, that aired May 2012.\n\n\n"}

His 6–4, 1–6, 7–5, 6–0 win over Joshua Pim in 1891 at the age of 19 years and five months made him, until Boris Becker in 1985, the youngest men's singles champion at Wimbledon. He was also runner-up in 1893, 1894 and 1896. With Herbert, he won four doubles championships at Wimbledon in 1891, 1894 – 1896. The twins retired from competitive lawn tennis after the 1897 Wimbledon Championships to pursue their law careers but made a reappearance in the doubles event at Wimbledon in 1904 and 1905.

{"id": "2213787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213787", "title": "Drill bit sizes", "text": "Drill bit sizes\n\nDrill bits are the cutting tools of drilling machines. They can be made in any size to order, but standards organizations have defined sets of sizes that are produced routinely by drill bit manufacturers and stocked by distributors.\n\nIn the U.S., fractional inch and gauge drill bit sizes are in common use. In nearly all other countries, metric drill bit sizes are most common, and all others are anachronisms or are reserved for dealing with designs from the US. The British Standards on replacing gauge size drill bits with metric sizes in the UK was first published in 1959.\n\nA comprehensive table for metric, fractional wire and tapping sizes can be found at the drill and tap size chart.\n\nMetric drill bit sizes define the diameter of the bit in terms of standard metric lengths. Standards organizations define sets of sizes that are conventionally manufactured and stocked. For example, British Standard BS 328 defines sizes from 0.2 mm to 25.0 mm.\n\nFrom 0.2 through 0.98 mm, sizes are defined as follows, where \"N\" is an integer from 2 through 9:\n\nFrom 1.0 through 2.95 mm, sizes are defined as follows, where \"N\" is an integer from 10 through 29:\n\nFrom 3.0 through 13.9 mm, sizes are defined as follows, where \"N\" is an integer from 30 through 139:\n\nFrom 14.0 through 25.0 mm, sizes are defined as follows, where \"M\" is an integer from 14 through 25:\n\nIn smaller sizes, bits are available in smaller diameter increments. This reflects both the smaller drilled hole diameter tolerance possible on smaller holes and the wishes of designers to have drill bit sizes available within at most 10% of an arbitrary hole size.\n\nThe price and availability of particular size bits does not change uniformly across the size range. Bits at size increments of 1 mm are most commonly available, and lowest price. Sets of bits in 1 mm increments might be found on a market stall. In 0.5 mm increments, any hardware store. In 0.1 mm increments, any engineers' store. Sets are not commonly available in smaller size increments, except for drill bits below 1 mm diameter. Drill bits of the less routinely used sizes, such as 2.55 mm, would have to be ordered from a specialist drill bit supplier. This subsetting of standard sizes is in contrast to general practice with number gauge drill bits, where it is rare to find a set on the market which does not contain every gauge.\n\nThere are also Renard series sequences of preferred metric drill bits:\n\nMetric dimensioning is routinely used for drill bits of all types, although the details of BS 328 apply only to twist drill bits. For example, a set of Forstner bits may contain 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mm diameter cutters.\n\nFractional inch drill bit sizes are still in common use in the United States and in any factory (around the globe) that makes inch-sized products for the U.S. market. \n\nANSI B94.11M-1979 sets size standards for jobber-length straight-shank twist drill bits from 1/64 inch through 1 inch in 1/64 inch increments. For Morse taper-shank drill bits, the standard continues in 1/64 inch increments up to 1¾ inch, then 1/32 inch increments up to 2¼ inch, 1/16 inch increments up to 3 inches, 1/8 inch increments up to 3¼ inches, and a single 1/4 inch increment to 3½ inches. One aspect of this method of sizing is that the size increment between drill bits becomes larger as bit sizes get smaller: 100% for the step from 1/64th to 1/32nd, but a much smaller percentage between 1 47/64th and 1 3/4.\n\nDrill bit sizes are written as irreducible fractions. So, instead of 78/64 inch, or 1 14/64 inch, the size is noted as 1 7/32 inch.\n\nBelow is a chart providing the decimal-fraction equivalents that are most relevant to fractional-inch drill bit sizes (that is, 0 to 1 by 64ths). (Decimal places for .25, .5, and .75 are shown to thousandths [.250, .500, .750], which is how machinists usually think about them [\"two-fifty\", \"five hundred\", \"seven-fifty\"]. Machinists generally truncate the decimals after thousandths; for example, a 27/64\" drill bit may be referred to in shop-floor speech as a \"four-twenty-one drill\".)\n\nCharts like this, printed at poster size, are widely posted on machine shop walls for handy reference by machinists as they work. For some tasks it is faster and less annoying to glance down a column of numbers on a poster than it is to punch calculator buttons or do penciled arithmetic. It is also true that with long experience, talented machinists have much of the chart memorized anyway (with decimals to truncated thou). But the poster is there for reference and quick sanity check as needed. Tool distributors often give away such charts as promotional merchandise. \n\nFor anyone looking to create such a poster or to tailor the design and colors to their own preferences, it is useful to realize that spreadsheet software makes this fast and easy to do. The tools that the software provides—formulas, cell formatting with rounding, autofill, and sorting by numerical order—obviate any manual calculation and data entry. For example, one can create the inch nominal rows for the chart—with columns for inch fraction, inch decimal, and corresponding millimeter decimal conversion—using formulas, cell formatting with rounding, and autofill; and one can then create the metric nominal rows below that, with the inch decimal conversions being provided by formula; and then one can sort the whole sheet by size order, automatically interposing the inch nominal and metric nominal rows by size order. Font and color can be chosen to make a poster-size chart that is easy to read from 1 or 2 meters away. Printing can be done on a desktop printer, with the letter-size sheets then being stapled together to make up the larger poster. \n\nNumber drill bit gauge sizes range from size 80 (the smallest) to size 1 (the largest) followed by letter gauge size A (the smallest) to size Z (the largest). Although the ASME B94.11M twist drill standard, for example, lists sizes as small as size 97, sizes smaller than 80 are rarely encountered in practice.\n\nNumber and letter sizes are commonly used for twist drill bits rather than other drill forms, as the range encompass the sizes for which twist drill bits are most often used.\n\nThe gauge-to-diameter ratio is not defined by a formula, but is instead based on, but is not identical to, the Stubs Steel Wire Gauge, which originated in Britain during the 19th century. The accompanying graph, with each step along the horizontal axis being one gauge size, illustrate the change in diameter with change in gauge, as well as the reduction in step size as the gauge size decreases.\n\nNumber and letter gauge drill bits are still in common use in the U.S. and to a lesser extent the UK, where they have largely been superseded by metric sizes. Other countries that formerly used the number series have for the most part also abandoned these in favour of metric sizes.\n\nThe shortest standard-length drills (that is, lowest length-to-diameter ratio) are \"screw-machine-length drills\" (sometimes abbreviated \"S/M\"). They are named for their use in screw machines. Their shorter flute length and shorter overall length compared to a standard jobber bit results in a more rigid drill bit, reducing deflection and breakage. They are rarely available in retail hardware stores or home centers.\n\nJobber-length drills are the most commonly found type of drill. The length of the flutes is between 9 and 14 times the diameter of the drill, depending on the drill size. So a diameter drill will be able to drill a hole deep, since it is 9 times the diameter in length. A diameter drill can drill a hole deep, since it is 13 times the diameter in flute length.\n\nThe term \"jobber\" refers to a wholesale distributor—a person or company that buys from manufacturers and sells to retailers. (It was especially widely used in the 1850-1950 period.) Manufacturers producing drill bits \"for the trade\" (as opposed to for specialized machining applications with particular length and design requirements) made ones of medium length suitable for a wide variety of jobs, because that was the type most desirable for general distribution. Thus, at the time that the name of jobber-length drill bits became common, it reflected the same concept that names like \"general-purpose\" and \"multipurpose\" reflect.\n\nExtended-reach or long-series drills are commonly called aircraft-length from their original use in manufacturing riveted aluminum aircraft. For bits thicker than a minimum size such as , they are available in fixed lengths such as rather than the progressive lengths of jobber drills. \n\nThe image shows a long-series drill compared to its diametric equivalents, all are in diameter. The equivalent Morse taper drill shown in the middle is of the usual length for a taper-shank drill. The lower drill bit is the \"jobber\" or \"parallel shank\" equivalent. \n\nCenter drills are available with two different included angles; 60 degrees is the standard for drilling centre holes (for example for subsequent centre support in the lathe), but 90 degrees is also common and used when locating holes prior to drilling with twist drills. Center drills are made specifically for drilling lathe centers, but are often used as spotting drills because of their radial stiffness.\n\nSpotting drills are available in a relatively small range of sizes, both metric and imperial, as their purpose is to provide a precise spot for guiding a standard twist drill. Commonly available sizes are 1/8\", 1/4\", 3/8\", 1/2\", 5/8\", 3/4\", 4 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, 14 mm, 16 mm and 18 mm. The drills are most ordinarily available with either 90° or 120° included angle points.\n\n"}

The company claims to have essentially \"reverse engineered\" the receptors in humans that react for taste and aroma, and that they are capitalizing on these discoveries to produce chemicals that will make food taste better. On 17 Sept 2018, Firmenich completed the acquisition of Senomyx. \n\nSenomyx was founded by prominent biochemist Lubert Stryer in 1999. In May 2001, Stryer returned to his professorship at Stanford University and resigned from Senomyx, but continues to be the Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board.\n\nThe company developed \"Substance 951\", a potentiator used to amplify the sweetness of sugar in food products, thereby allowing the manufacturer to reduce the amount of sugar used.\n\nSenomyx develops patented flavor enhancers by using \"proprietary taste receptor-based assay systems\", which have been previously expressed in human cell culture, in HEK293 cells.\n\nHEK293 cells are a cell line widely used in biological and medical research, immortalised through a genetic modification removed from the original human embryonic kidney cells taken from a healthy, electively aborted human fetus in the early 1970s. The receptors in the assay are used to \"identify\" flavours; they are not used as flavours themselves. No human taste receptors are used as ingredients in any flavourings. Using information from the human genome sequence, Senomyx has identified hundreds of taste receptors and currently owns 113 patents on their discoveries. Senomyx collaborates with seven of the world's largest food companies to further their research and to fund development of their technology.\n\nSenomyx's products work by amplifying the intensity of flavors. Because very small amounts of the additive are used (reportedly less than one part per million) Senomyx's chemical compounds will not appear on labels, but will fall under the broad category of \"artificial flavors.\" For the same reason, the company's chemicals have not undergone the FDA's usual safety approval process for food additives. Senomyx's MSG-enhancer gained the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status from the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association, an industry-funded organization, in less than 18 months, which included three months of tests on rats.\n\nAccording to Senomyx's website, it \"received a positive review by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, which determined that there were no safety concerns with the use of the Company's savory flavor ingredients in foods. The positive assessment by JECFA is expected to expedite regulatory approvals in a number of countries, particularly those that do not have independent regulatory approval systems.\"\n\nTwo of Senomyx's newest innovations include a Cool Flavor Program that seeks to enhance cooling, menthol sensations, and a Bitter Blocker Program. According to Senomyx's website, the company is collaborating with Solae, the international soy ingredients supplier, \"to develop new bitter blockers that better modulate and control bitterness in certain soy-based products.\" Senomyx has identified the receptors in the mouth responsible for sensing bitter taste and developed a chemical additive to knock out these receptors when eaten with hydrolyzed soy protein and other soy derivatives.\n\nSenomyx's revenues for the last quarter of 2007 were up 87% from the same period in 2006, and its stock prices are rising. CEO Kent Snyder reports that corporate goals include \"continuing to achieve significant progress in all of our discovery and development programs such as regulatory approval for our S2383 sucralose enhancer and selection of a sucrose enhancer for regulatory development. We also expect expanded commercialization of food products containing our savory flavor ingredients and additional new business development accomplishments.\"\n"}

It became CVS Corporation in 1996 under a massive reorganization plan. The company traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker MES, before changing its ticker to CVS.\n\nDuring the period from 1925 to 1928 the number of Melville stores increased by 184% and net income expanded 360%. In the first three months of 1929 the chain store realized a 34% increase in sales over 1928. In February 1930 the Melville Shoe Corporation controlled 460 Thom McAn, Rival, and John Ward stores in thirty-nine of the United States. At its peak, Melville operated over 7,282 retail stores in approximately 3,500 unique locations, providing a wide range of products.\n\nIn April 1976 the Melville Corporation acquired Marshalls, a chain of thirty-two specialty stores, based in New England. The purchase price was $40 million.\n\nMelville was one of the first companies in the world to develop a shared-services satellite communications network, consolidating the infrastructure of all of its discrete divisions, resulting in significant cost savings for the corporation.\n\nBeginning in the early 1990s, Melville was under pressure to reorganize and shed its diverse portfolio.

While being prepared they may be brushed with a flavoring sauce, often one made of soy sauce and \"mirin\". They may then be wrapped with a layer of nori. Alternatively they may be flavored with salt or \"salad\" flavoring, among others.\n\nIn China, the same characters used to write \"senbei\" are read jiānbǐng (煎餅). There are varieties like Shandong Jianbing and Tianjin Jianbing. However, these are in actuality a different food. In China, they are more like wraps and pancakes, similar to \"okonomiyaki\", whereas in Japan they are hard (not floppy), and are bite-sized snacks rather than meals. However, crackers similar to Japanese \"senbei\" can be found in China today. Their modern Chinese name is / (Pinyin: \"xiānbèi\"), which reflects the Japanese-language pronunciation of \"senbei\" (煎餅).\n\nSweet \"senbei\" (甘味煎餅) came to Japan during the Tang dynasty, with the first recorded usage in 737 AD, and still are very similar to Tang traditional styles, originally often baked in the Kansai area, of which include the traditional \"roof tile\" \"senbei\". These include ingredients like potato and wheat flour or glutinous rice, and are similar to castella cakes, distinctly different from what most people would consider as \"senbei\" today, though traditional \"senbei\" such as this can still be found, e.g. \"Iga meibutsu katayaki\", in Iga City.\n\nWhat Japanese commonly refer to as \"senbei\" nowadays was popularized by a shop in the Edo period, Sōkajuku, which spread salty soy sauce flavored \"senbei\" throughout Japan.\n\nThere are several types of \"traditional\" Japanese \"senbei\". They include the two categories, sweet \"sembei\" (over 15 types) and rice candy \"senbei\" (米菓煎餅), and others, which include even fish \"senbei\" (魚せんべい), lotus \"senbei\" (蓮根煎餅) and bone \"senbei\" (骨せんべい).\n\nModern \"senbei\" versions are very inventive and may include flavorings which can range from kimchi to wasabi to curry to chocolate.\n\nKansai \"senbei\" tend to use glutinous rice and are lightly seasoned and delicate in texture (\"saku saku\"). Kantō \"senbei\" were originally based on \"uruchimai\", a non-glutinous rice, and they tend to be more crunchy (\"kari kari\") and richly flavored.\n\nThin Japanese rice crackers (薄焼きせんべい \"usuyaki senbei\") are popular in Australia and other countries.\n\n\n"}

The book, which enjoyed immense popularity in the years before World War I, is an early example of the espionage novel and was extremely influential in the genre of spy fiction. It has been made into feature-length films for both cinema and television.\n\nThe novel \"owes a lot to the wonderful adventure novels of writers like Rider Haggard, that were a staple of Victorian Britain\". It was a spy novel that \"established a formula that included a mass of verifiable detail, which gave authenticity to the story – the same ploy that would be used so well by John Buchan, Ian Fleming, John le Carré and many others.\" All of the physical background is completely authentic - the various Frisian islands and towns named in the book actually exist and the descriptions of them accurate (often, from the author's own experience). The same is true for the various \"sands\" of the title - vast areas which are flooded at high tide but become mudflats at ebb. Navigating a small boat under these conditions requires a specialized kind of skilled seamanship - of which the character Davies is an unsurpassed master, and the descriptions of his feats are of abiding interest to yachting enthusiasts, quite apart from their role in the book's espionage plot. \n\nCarruthers, a minor official in the Foreign Office, is contacted by an acquaintance, Davies, asking him to join in a yachting holiday in the Baltic Sea. Carruthers agrees, as his other plans for a holiday have fallen through, and because of a heartbreak due to a woman he courted becoming engaged to another man.\n\nHe arrives to find that Davies has a small sailing boat (the vessel is named \"Dulcibella\", a reference to Childers's own sister of that name), not the comfortable crewed yacht that he expected. However Carruthers agrees to go on the trip and joins Davies in Flensburg on the Baltic, whence they head for the Frisian Islands, off the coast of Germany. Carruthers has to learn quickly how to sail the small boat.\n\nDavies gradually reveals that he suspects that the Germans are undertaking something sinister in the German Frisian islands. This is based on his belief that he was nearly wrecked by a German yacht luring him into a shoal in rough weather during a previous trip. The yacht was owned and captained by a mysterious German entrepreneur called Dollmann, whom Davies suspects of being in fact an expatriate Englishman posing as a German. The situation was further complicated by Davies having fallen deeply in love with Dollmann's daughter, Klara - who, Davies is sure, is not involved in whatever nefarious scheme her father is engaged upon. In any case, Davies is suspicious about what would motivate Dollmann to try to kill him, and believed that it is some scheme involving the German Imperial government. Having failed to interest anyone in the British government in the incident, Davies feels it is his patriotic duty to investigate further on his own – hence the invitation to Carruthers.\n\nCarruthers and Davies spend some time exploring the shallow tidal waters of the Frisian Islands, moving closer to the mysterious site where there is a rumoured secret treasure recovery project in progress on the island of Memmert. The two men discover that that Dollmann is involved in the recovery project. Carruthers and Davies try to approach Memmert. They are warned away by a German Navy patrol boat, the \"Blitz\", and its commander von Bruning - who is friendly and affable, but still makes a veiled warning. This makes them all the more sure that there is something more than a treasure dig on the island. And meanwhile, they discover that, not only is Dollmann indeed an Englishman, he had been an officer in the Royal Navy - evidently having had to leave Britain in hurry and take up a new life as a German. \n\nTaking advantage of a thick fog, Davies navigates them covertly through the complicated sandbanks in a small boat to investigate the Memmert site. Carruthers investigates the island. He overhears von Bruning and Dollmann discussing something more than treasure hunting, including cryptic references to \"Chatham\", \"Seven\" and \"the tide serving\", and hear of a rendezvous at the Frisian railway station, several days ahead. The pair return through the fog to the \"Dulcibella\", moored at the island of Norderney. There, they find Dollmann and von Bruning have beaten them and are seemingly suspicious. However, getting in the fog from Norderney to Memmert and back is a nearly impossible feat, which only Davies' superb seamanship could have achieved, and the Germans do not seriously suspect them of having done that. \n\nVon Bruning invites them to Dollmann's villa for a dinner, where he attempts to subtly cross-examine them to find out if they are British spies. Carruthers plays a dangerous game, admitting they are curious. But he convinces von Bruning that he believes the cover story about treasure and merely wants to see the imaginary \"wreck\". The party also serves to show that the Germans do not fully trust the renegade Englishman Dollmann and that there is some rift between them which might be widened. \n\nCarruthers announces that the Foreign Office has recalled him to England. He heads off, being accompanied part of the way to the Dutch border by one of the German conspirators - outwardly an affable fellow-traveler. But instead of embarking from Amsterdam to England, he doubles back, returns to Germany in time to be present at the conspirators' rendezvous (to which Dollmann, significantly, was not invited). He manages to follow von Bruning and his men without being noticed, and trails them to a port where they board a tugboat towing a barge. Carruthers then sneaks aboard and hides, and the convoy heads to sea.\n\nCarruthers finally puts the riddle together. The Germans are linking the canals and the railways, dredging passages through the shifting sands and hiding a fleet of tugs and barges. The only explanation is that they are going to secretly transport a powerful German army across the North Sea to invade Britain's east coast. He escapes after grounding the tugboat and rushes back to Davies. He finds him and explains how they must flee before the Germans come after them. They convince Dollmann and Clara to come with them to avoid Dollmann's being arrested by the Germans, who will think he has changed sides again. They promise Dollman immunity from being charged for treason in Britain - which, acting on their own and not having any authorization from the British government, they were not truly in a position to promise. As they sail across the North Sea, Dollmann commits suicide by jumping overboard, presumably to avoid disgrace and probable arrest. \n\nAn epilogue by the \"editor\" examines the details of a report prepared by Dollmann, outlining his plan for the invasion force. A postscript notes that the Royal Navy is finally taking countermeasures to intercept any German invasion fleet and urges haste.\n\nChilders's biographer Andrew Boyle noted: \"For the next ten years Childers's book remained the most powerful contribution of any English writer to the debate on Britain's alleged military unpreparedness.\" It was a notable influence on John Buchan, and on Ken Follett, who described it as \"an open-air adventure thriller about two young men who stumble upon a German armada preparing to invade England.\" Follett has also called it \"the first modern thriller\".\n\nRhodri Jeffreys-Jones listed \"The Riddle of the Sands\" as one of the ten classic spy novels, in \"The Guardian\"'s best spy novel list. Robert McCrum of \"The Observer\" included it in his list of the 100 greatest novels of all time.\n\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" has cited the book as the second best spy novel of all time, after Kipling's \"Kim\".\n\nThough wars with Germany would become a central issue for Britain for much of the 20th Century, in fact few Britons anticipated that before 1900. Historically, it was France which was the traditional enemy of England and Britain, from the Hundred Years' War until the Napoleonic Wars. Just nine years before \"The Riddle of the Sands\", William Le Queux published \"The Great War in England\", raising the specter of a French surprise invasion of England, reaching London - with Germany cast as Britain's loyal ally, rushing to help and in the nick of time saving England from the evil French; as evident from the great success of this book when published in 1894, the British public at that time took seriously the idea of a French threat and a German ally. But Emperor Wilhelm II's policy of building up the German Navy and challenging the British sea power effected a change in the actual power relations - reflected in the specific literary genre of invasion novels and the identity assigned to the possible invader of British soil. \n\nAs described in its author's own words, \"Riddle of the Sands\" was written as \"... a story with a purpose\" in the author's written from \"a patriot's natural sense of duty\", which predicted war with Germany and called for British preparedness. The whole genre of \"invasion novels\" raised the public's awareness of the \"potential threat\" of Imperial Germany. Although the belief has grown that the book was responsible for the development of the naval base at Rosyth, the novel was published in May 1903, two months after the purchase of the land for the Rosyth naval base was announced in Parliament (5 March 1903) and some time after secret negotiations for the purchase had begun. Although Winston Churchill later credited the book as a major reason why the Admiralty had decided to establish the new naval bases, this seems unlikely. When war was declared he ordered the Director of Naval Intelligence to find Childers, whom he had met when the author was campaigning to represent a naval seat in Parliament, and employ him. At the time Childers was writing \"Riddle\" he was also contributing to a factual book published by \"The Times\" in which he warned of outdated British army tactics in the event of \"conflicts of the future\". He developed this theme in two further works he published in 1911: \"War and the Arme Blanche\" and \"German Influence on British Cavalry\".\n\nThe novel contains many realistic details based on Childers's own sailing trips along the East Frisia coast and large parts of his logbook entries from an 1897 Baltic cruise \"appear almost unedited in the book.\" The yacht \"Dulcibella\" in the novel is based upon \"Vixen\", the boat Childers used for his exploration. In August 1910, inspired by the work, two British amateur yachtsmen, Captain Bernard Trench RM and Lieutenant Vivian Brandon RN, undertook a sailing holiday along the same section of the Frisian coast, during which they collected information about German naval installations. The two men were sentenced to four years custody by a military court in Leipzig, but they were pardoned by the Emperor in 1913. They joined \"Room 40\", the intelligence and decoding section of the British Admiralty, on the outbreak of war.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the demonization and vilification of Kaiser Wilhelm, which would become a staple of British propaganda in later years, are conspicuously absent from The Riddle of the Sands. To the contrary, on several occasions the character Davies expresses admiration for the German Emperor: \"He is a fine fellow, that emperor.(...) By Jove! We want a man like that Kaiser, who doesn't wait to be kicked, but works like a nigger for his country, and sees ahead\".\n\nLower in the hierarchy, Carruthers several times states that he likes Commander von Bruning as a person - and this liking is not diminished by the discovery that von Bruning is deeply involved in the plan to invade England. In general, the book's protagonists feel no malice towards the Germans. Rather, they take a \"sporting\" attitude, frankly admiring the Germans' audacity and resourcefulness while being determined to outwit these Germans and foil their plans.\n\nFrom the start it is obvious that something is going on behind the placid facade of the Frisian islands and towns. The protagonists gather hints, follow clues and form various hypotheses. There are many red herrings - for example, for much of the book, their suspicions centre on Memmert. However, though that island provides a convenient cover for the German plotters to meet and talk, what is actually going on there is a genuine salvage operation seeking to find a cargo of gold from a French ship sunken during the Napoleonic Wars. The actual German design, revealed only at the end - a full-fledged, meticulous plan for the invasion of England - is in fact unfolding among very mundane and prosaic small Frisian towns and harbours.\n\nAs set out in detail in the book's Epilogue, the German plan constitutes a vast, audacious military deception. While the British would observe the major German ports and the array of German battleships and detect no signs of an impending invasion, the invasion force would gather unnoticed in the Frisian countryside. German troops - infantry with the lightest type of field guns - would board big sea-going lighters, towed by powerful but shallow-draught tugs, which would proceed to the sea through the Frisian canal network that was unobtrusively widened and extended for years, in preparation for this day. Seven invasion flotillas would emerge - not from any major port, but out of seven contemptible tiny Frisian harbours which are open only on high tide and only to small vessels; harbours of whose existence the British Admiralty is barely aware, and which were certainly never viewed as having any kind of military value or posing any threat. From there, the invaders quickly dash over a distance of 240 sea miles and land completely unexpected and unopposed at The Wash on the East shore of England. With the beachhead secured, more German ships would follow with munitions and heavy artillery.\n\nAs the Epilogue points out, such an invasion would necessarily involve a German strategic gamble - since, after an initial confusion, the British Royal Navy could be expected to rally and regain its control of the North Sea. With that, the German invading force would be cut off from further supplies and would be dependent on what they could bring with them in the initial stage, plus whatever British resources they could capture. German success would depend on a swift exploitation of the element of surprise, breaking out of the initial landing area to quickly capture their main objective - \"the industrial heart of the [British] kingdom, the great northern and midland towns, with their teeming populations of peaceful wage earners\". The projected landing site at The Wash would place the Germans conveniently close to that industrial heartland. The plan does not include any direct attack on London (which would have necessitated a different and far more risky landing place). German hopes for a quick and decisive victory would hinge upon the loss of the industrial towns being so demoralizing to the British and dislocating to their economy that Britain would agree to sign a peace on terms favourable to Germany. Should the British prove persistent, obdurate and willing to engage in a long war (as they actually would in 1940) the German invading force, cut off from fresh supplies, might eventually end up in a dire situation.\n\nActually, the protagonists come upon the invasion plan in an advanced state of preparation - but still with a lot left to do before it could be implemented. One of the crucial factors for its success is to make sure that the lighters being built for troop transport would actually stand open sea conditions - unlike the ordinary lighters used in this area, which usually do not venture out of the protected waters behind the Frisian islands. The clue followed by Carruthers, in a brief overheard conversation of the German plotters, is that one such lighter would be tested under open sea conditions and that a certain high-ranking German \"insisted on being personally present\". The hidden Carruthers is present at the successful testing voyage where the lighter proves fully sea-worthy, and then manages to sabotage the tug and escape. In the confusion Carruthers sees the face of the high-ranking participant and recognizing him as \"one who, in Germany, has a better right to insist than anyone else\" - the implication clearly being that it was Kaiser Wilhelm II in person.\n\n\"The Riddle of the Sands\" (1979) is a film adaptation of the book, starring Michael York as Charles Carruthers and Simon MacCorkindale as Arthur Davies.\n\nIn Germany, the novel was popularised by the TV movie \"Das Rätsel der Sandbank\" (1984), produced by the public television and radio station Radio Bremen, and starring Burghart Klaußner as Davies and Peter Sattmann as Carruthers.\n\nIn 1998, nautical writer Sam Llewellyn wrote a continuation of the story named \"The Shadow in the Sands\". This is subtitled \"being an account of the cruise of the yacht \"Gloria\" in the Frisian Islands in April of 1903 and the Conclusion of the Events described by Erskine Childers.\"\n\nLlewellyn assumes that the British authorities disregarded the warnings brought by the protagonists of Childers' book and the preparations for a German invasion of England continued unabated. The Duke of Leominster - a cynical schemer but also a British patriot - takes on his own the act of sending the \" Gloria\" for a desperate last moment effort. On board are the narrator Charlie Webb - a lowly fisherman but highly capable and resourceful - together with his mate Sam and with the sinister Captain Dacre, a military officer cashiered for wantonly killing a Boer woman in South Africa. They tangle with the arrogant and cruel Baron von Tritt, and Charlie Webb wins the love of the beautiful Grafin von and zu Marsdorff (Katya to those intimate with her). A series of daring acts of sabotage and arson by the protagonists, undertaken with the risk of being hanged out of hand if caught, succeeds against all odds in derailing Kaiser Wilhelm's carefully prepared invasion plan, and a quarter of a million German soldiers who were poised to board the invasion fleet return to barracks. The German and British governments tacitly agree to pretend none of this ever happened, though the countdown continues towards the bloodletting of 1914. Meanwhile the resourceful Webb reaps his just rewards, marries happily his Graffin and is headed to a future as a shipping magnate and a seat in the House of Lords.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Byrne also had a number one single in Ireland in 2002, alongside the Republic of Ireland national football team and Dustin the Turkey with the Irish 2002 FIFA World Cup anthem, \"Here Come The Good Times (Ireland)\". He also co-wrote many of Westlife songs.\n\nIn early January 2016, it was rumored that RTÉ had internally chosen Byrne to represent Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016. Byrne had not yet confirmed or denied such information but announced that he would grab the opportunity with both hands if given. On 13 January, Byrne was confirmed to be the Irish singer for the 2016 contest in Stockholm with the song, \"Sunlight\". He performed in the second semi final on 12 May 2016, but failed to advance to the final.\n\nIn October 2018, a video was posted to Westlife's official social media platforms announcing the group's reunion as a four-piece. In 2019, the group will be headlining \"The 20 Tour\", named in honour of Westlife's 20th anniversary since its formation and the release of its first single, \"Swear It Again\", in 1999. In addition to touring, Westlife will also be releasing new music. \"Hello My Love\", the first single from the group's upcoming album, will debut on the \"Graham Norton Show\" on 10 and 11 January 2019.\n\nIn 2002, Byrne guest-hosted an edition of \"\" with Cat Deeley.\n\nByrne hosted the closing ceremony of the Special Olympics live from Dublin's Croke Park in front of 80,000 spectators.\n\nThroughout the years, Byrne has appeared on Children in Need and Comic Relief several times. In 2001, he co-hosted Children in Need live from Belfast and in 2011 and co-hosted a BBC Radio 2 radio special with Patrick Kielty for the cause.\n\nByrne has narrated stage shows such as \"The Snowman Christmas Special\" and the \"Picture of You\" documentary dedicated to former Boyzone member Stephen Gately who died on 10 October 2009.\n\nByrne has also hosted the Cheerios ChildLine Concert, a record, seven times, which was broadcast on RTÉ2, and in more recent years TV3.\n\nIn addition, Byrne presented several editions of the \"Celebrity Sunday\" radio programme on RTÉ 2fm in 2010. Listeners tuned in from as far and wide as Mexico, Chile, the United Kingdom, Philippines and Indonesia. The fourth and final edition of the programme, broadcast on 14 February 2010, trended worldwide on Twitter. FM104 publicly offered him a job the day Westlife announced their split.\n\nIn October 2012, Byrne hosted the RTÉ reality TV show \"Football's Next Star\". The series followed ten young hopefuls competing for a chance to win a place with Celtic Football Club's youth squad.\n\nIn 2013 through 2015, 2017 and 2018 Byrne presented the Irish votes at the Eurovision Song Contest. He also co-hosted the short-lived TV talent show \"The Hit\" on RTÉ One along with Aidan Power.\n\nOn 4 February 2014, Byrne signed a contract with RTÉ 2fm to host a new weekday show from 11am to 2pm.\n\nIn January 2015, Byrne started hosting the new weekly National Lottery game show, \"The Million Euro Challenge\" on RTÉ 1, although the show was axed that July.\n\nIn January 2017, Byrne started hosting an Irish version of the TV show \"Dancing with the Stars\", alongside Amanda Byram and with Jennifer Zamparelli from 2019.\n\nIn March 2019, Byrne left 2FM to rejoin the newly reunited Westlife.\n\nByrne has co-written some songs in his Westlife years and on all ten tracks on his debut solo album and also to one unreleased song:\n\n\nByrne was born to parents Yvonne and Nicholas (d. 2009). He has an older sister, Gillian, and a younger brother, Adam. Byrne married his teenage sweetheart Georgina Ahern, whom he met when they were about 12 years old. He went to St Gabriel's NS whe he was a child.· The two were married on 5 August 2003 at the Wicklow Register Office, Wicklow, County Wicklow. Twin sons Rocco and Jay were born on 20 April 2007. The civil ceremony was followed by a church blessing on 9 August at the Roman Catholic Church of St Pierre et St Paul in Gallardon, Eure-et-Loir, France and a reception at the nearby 16th-century Château d'Esclimont. On 29 April 2013, Byrne announced on his Twitter page that he and his wife Georgina were expecting their third child, and on Irish television it was announced that the baby was due around Halloween. Daughter Gia was born on 23 October 2013.\n\nGodparents for the children are Byrne's sister Gillian Byrne and her husband Mark Gallagher and Georgina's sister Cecelia Ahern and Byrne's brother Adam McGarry Byrne. Byrne Sr. sang part-time on Dublin's cabaret and karaoke scene and was presented with a Harley-Davidson motorbike by his son on his sixtieth birthday party the year before his death.\n\nIn 2010, Byrne and his family organised the 'Nikki Byrne Twilight Ball', a fundraising event, in memory of their father who died in November 2009. The event raised over €200,000 and completely funded a television and radio heart attack awareness campaign in connection with 'The Irish Heart Foundation'. Byrne, and his wife Georgina, are keen supporters of the Irish Premature Babies charity. Byrne also supports UNICEF and has taken part in several UNICEF Campaigns, such as the UNICEF 'Euro for Zero' campaign where the goal was to raise as much money as possible in November 2010 for Child Survival Programmes.\n"}

Unlike most keyboards, the PLUM keyboard organizes keys in a square grid, as opposed to the staggered rows of a typewriter. Though the Plum Keyboard is currently off-line, it is still being promoted. \n\nThe purpose of the product is to teach non-typists how to type, not to encourage Qwerty users to switch. The ergonomic advantages are secondary to the incredibly short learning curve. New typists learning Qwerty can typically expect a 4- to 6-week learning curve, whereas new typists learning Plum can touch-type within two weeks. This is possible because Plum incorporates mnemonics to assist the learner. \"READONTHIS\" is not only easily remembered, they are the ten most frequently used keys and make up the home row where the fingers rest, thus minimizing finger movement. The Plum layout also gives equal time to each hand. With Qwerty, the left hand does 70% of the work, while the right hand does only 30%. \n\nIt is notable that the \"Enter\" key has moved to a half-length \"spacebar\" position alongside the spacebar itself. Each is now used by one thumb alone; left for \"Enter\" and right for \"Space\". Also, the Tab and Backspace keys are conveniently and centrally located within the array of letters, as are the comma and period.\n\nThe layout of the PLUM keyboard is compact, using standard key sizes throughout, rather than the usual widened keytops for control keys. This has led to criticism, particularly over the positioning of the \"Shift\" keys. These are at each end of the home row. Although usable for text entry by a touch-typist experienced with the PLUM layout, they are unpopular with programmers who make extensive use of shift for non-letter characters. The extra Function keys F13, F14, and F15 map to Print Screen, Scroll Lock, and the Pause/Break key respectively, although no Scroll Lock light exists. There are also six blank keys surrounding the Arrow keys, which do nothing.\n\nIt is debatable whether this layout reduces repetitive strain injury, but the general consensus is that while it might prolong it slightly, the QWERTY keyboard might simply aggravate pains without causing the disease, and studies have shown that typists are not any more likely to develop RSI than normal people. Users of PLUM keyboards, however have claimed that after switching keyboard layouts, their pains went away. While there are currently no good studies comparing the efficiency of the PLUM and Dvorak keyboards, the Dvorak keyboard is more mainstream, but the PLUM keyboard has a keyboard layout that many find more memorable, with the rows spelling out the words \"PLUM,\" \"READONTHIS\" and \"WXYZ\".\n\nAs of 2012, PLUM keyboards were no longer being manufactured.\n"}

Since the solution boils over a range of temperatures as in distillation, more of the heat can be extracted from the source than with a pure working fluid. The same applies on the exhaust (condensing) end. This provides efficiency comparable to a Combined cycle, with less complexity.\n\nBy appropriate choice of the ratio between the components of the solution, the boiling point of the working solution can be adjusted to suit the heat input temperature. Water and ammonia is the most widely used combination, but other combinations are feasible.\n\nBecause of this ability to take full advantage of the temperature difference between the particular heat source and sink available, it finds applications in reuse of industrial process heat, geothermal energy, solar energy, and use of waste heat from power plants (Bottoming cycle).\n\nRecoverable heat from industrial processes\n\nThe \"Kalina cycle\" has been thought to increase thermal power output efficiencies by up to 50% in suitable installations, and is ideally suited for applications such as steel, coal, oil refineries and cement production plants.\n\nGeothermal \n\nA second generation of Kalina cycle systems was developed by Dr. Kalina and Kalex LLC.

{"id": "2213864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213864", "title": "Mincome", "text": "Mincome\n\nMincome, the \"Manitoba Basic Annual Income Experiment\", was a Canadian Guaranteed Annual Income (GAI) social experiment conducted in Manitoba in the 1970s. The project was funded jointly by the Manitoba provincial government and the Canadian federal government under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. It was launched with a news release on February 22, 1974, under the New Democratic Party of Manitoba government of Edward Schreyer, and was closed down in 1979 under the Progressive Conservative of Manitoba government of Sterling Lyon and the federal Progressive Conservative Party of Joe Clark. The purpose of the experiment was to assess the social impact of a guaranteed, unconditional annual income, UBI, including whether a program of this nature would create disincentives to work for the recipients and, if so, to what extent.\n\nThe experiment consisted of a randomized controlled trial in the City of Winnipeg and in rural Manitoba (the rural dispersed site). A so-called \"saturation site\" pilot project in the town of Dauphin, Manitoba was added in 1973. The Winnipeg and Dauphin sites randomly allocated lower-income households to one of seven treatment groups and a control group. The families in the treatment groups received an income guarantee or minimum cash benefit according to family size that was reduced by a specific amount (35, 50 or 75 cents) for every dollar they earned by working.\n\nDauphin residents were eligible for a single treatment that reduced the benefit guarantee by 50 cents for each dollar earned. Also the Dauphin site had only one plan (Plan 4) and unlike the Winnipeg and rural dispersed sites, any resident of the city could apply.\n\nNo final Mincome report was issued, but a federal grant established the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Manitoba in 1981. The institute developed a machine-readable database of the results of Mincome, leaving the analysis of the experiment to individual academic initiatives.\n\nAn important motivation of Mincome and the negative income tax experiments in the U.S. was to determine the impact of a guaranteed income plan on incentives to work. University of Manitoba economists Derek Hum and Wayne Simpson analyzed labour supply or work disincentive issues in Mincome during the 1980s and published their results in a series of papers and a monograph. Their results showed a small impact on labour markets, with working hours dropping one percent for men, three percent for married women, and five percent for unmarried women. The largest impact appeared to be changes in family composition, not the experimental treatments, as preschool children increased the labour supply of husbands and reduced the labour supply of wives by roughly the same modest amount. Even these decreases in hours worked may be seen to be offset by the opportunity cost of more time for family and education. However, some have argued these drops may be artificially low because participants knew the guaranteed income was temporary. This represents an important limitation to the knowledge of the impact of a guaranteed annual income as little is known about the long term effects on willingness to work.\n\nEconomists Derek Hum and Wayne Simpson analysed the labour supply responses and discovered that they were generally smaller than those estimated for similar experiments in the United States. David Prescott, Robert Swidinsky, and David Wilton examined the labour supply response of female heads of household, showing that the presence of younger children and another income earning head (husband) prompted a reduction in work. In 2016, David Calnitsky published an analysis of a community survey of Dauphin completed in 1976 that probed for motivations for participation and perceptions of stigma associated with a GAI. He finds that an important benefit of basic annual incomes is the reduced stigma compared to conventional welfare.\n\nUniversity of Manitoba economist Evelyn Forget () conducted a quasi-experimental analysis that compared health outcomes of Dauphin residents with other Manitoba residents. This research did not use the Mincome data directly, but under the assumption that if a high proportion of Dauphin residents participated in Mincome, one should be able to discern differences in social, economic, and health outcomes for that group, compared to the general population. Forget found that in the period that Mincome was administered, hospital visits dropped 8.5 percent, with fewer incidents of work-related injuries, and fewer emergency room visits from accidents and injuries. Forget also compared proportions of women with children and suggested lower lifetime fertility as a possible outcome by comparing birth rates of young mothers with those of a control group. Additionally, the period saw a reduction in rates of psychiatric hospitalization, and in the number of mental illness-related consultations with health professionals.\n\nThe basic income is claimed to produce a range of health and social benefits, but it is important to underscore that none of the income maintenance experiments, including Mincome, produced direct evidence of a causal relation between income support and health outcomes. A focus of the Ontario Basic Income Pilot was to assess changes in health status among a range of other social outcomes, but the Ontario government cancelled this experiment in the summer of 2018.\n\nA review of the Mincome experiment appeared in the \"Winnipeg Free Press\" on 23 January 2017. A comprehensive review of Mincome appears in \"Canadian Public Policy\".\n\nMincome data and documentation may be accessed through the University of Manitoba Library system at the university's Dataverse website.\n\n\n"}

It is located in Tihar village, approximately 3 km from Janakpuri, to the west of New Delhi, India. The surrounding area is called Hari Nagar.\n\nThe prison is styled as a correctional institution. Its main objective is to convert its inmates into ordinary members of society by providing them with useful skills, education, and respect for the law. It aims to improve the inmates' self-esteem and strengthen their desire to improve. To engage, rehabilitate, and reform its inmates, Tihar uses music therapy, which involves music training sessions and concerts. The prison has its own radio station, run by inmates. There is also a prison industry within the walls, manned wholly by inmates, which bears the brand \"Tihar\". , Tihar jail has 10,533 inmates against the sanctioned capacity of 6,250. Though the figure is down from around 12,000 in 2006, the prison remains seriously overcrowded.\n\nOriginally, Tihar was a maximum security a prison run by the State of Punjab. In 1966 control was transferred to the National Capital Territory of Delhi. Beginning in 1984, additional facilities were constructed, and the complex became Tihar Prison, also largest jail in India.\n\nUnder the charge of Kiran Bedi, when she was Inspector General of Prisons, she instituted a number of prison reforms at Tihar, including changing its name to Tihar Ashram. She also instituted a Vipassana meditation program for both staff and inmates; initial classes were taught by S. N. Goenka. The Prison has also produced an inmate who has passed the Indian Administrative Service civil service examinations.\n\nMany of the inmates continue their higher education through distance education. The campus placement programme was launched in 2011 for the rehabilitation of no about to complete their sentences. In 2014, a recruitment drive led to 66 inmates selected on the basis of their good conduct, received job offers with salaries up to per month, from as many as 31 recruiters, which included educational institutions, NGOs and private companies.\n\nIn 1961, the Jail Factory was established in Central Jail No.2, at Tihar. Over the years its activities have expanded to include Carpentry, Weaving (Handloom & Powerloom), Tailoring, Chemical, Handmade paper, Commercial art and Bakery. Later in 2009, a shoe manufacturing unit was established using the Public-Private Partnership model, and thus the brand \"TJ's\" was launched. Today, 700 inmates work in these units, and 25% of their earnings are deposited in the Victim Welfare Fund, which provides compensation to the victims and their families.\n\nIn June 2015 two of the inmates were able to scale an inner wall then tunnel under the outer wall and crawl through a drain to escape the prison.\n\nThe prison complex has no facilities for keeping paraplegic pre-trial inmates or convicts.\n\nThe Integrated Counseling and Testing Centre reports that around 6% to 8% of the 11,800 Tihar inmates are HIV-positive, which is considerably higher than the HIV rate among the general population in India.\n\n\"Doing Time, Doing Vipassana\" is a 1997 documentary about the introduction of S. N. Goenka's 10-day Vipassana classes at Tihar Jail in 1993 by then Inspector General of Prisons in New Delhi, Kiran Bedi. Bedi had her guards trained in Vipassana first, and then she had Goenka give his initial class to 1,000 prisoners.\n\n"}

It is chiefly notable as having featured a \"Mork & Mindy\" crossover, and for the controversy surrounding its status as a spin-off of \"Happy Days\".\n\nThe series starred Jimmy Brogan as Random, an angel-in-training who is assigned to live with (and act as guardian angel for) a suburban Chicago family (led by a single mom played by Dixie Carter, later of \"Designing Women\") as well as work as a high school teacher. The series debuted on September 9, 1979, but it got poor ratings against \"60 Minutes\" on CBS (the #1 show on TV that year) and Disney on NBC. After seven episodes aired, ABC pulled \"Blue\", as well as fellow freshman sitcom \"A New Kind of Family\", after their October 21 airings. Five more episodes were produced, but only one ever aired on ABC (on December 16) before \"Out of the Blue\" went into the black.\n\n\"Out of the Blue\" has engendered debate amongst some viewers concerning its precise relationship to \"Happy Days\". The controversy arises from the fact that the first episode of the series was broadcast a little over one week prior to an episode of \"Happy Days\" featuring Jimmy Brogan as the character Random. Television observer and owner of Sitcoms Online, Todd Fuller, maintains that because \"Chachi Sells His Soul\" aired on September 18, 1979, Random's appearance on this \"Happy Days\" episode was a crossover. He goes on to postulate: \"The \"Happy Days\" episode was likely a promotional tool for \"Out of the Blue\" to make the character more known.\"\n\nThom Holbrook, who has a website devoted to TV crossovers and spin-offs, sees the arguments against calling it a spin-off, but ultimately concludes: \"Making it a crossover would be basing things all on an odd bit of scheduling decades ago. The intent was spin off. The tone of the \"Happy Days\" episode is that of a dry run on the character, that of a pilot episode.\"\n\n\n\n"}

He had established a sawmill there and was Brownsdale's first merchant. The original name of Brownsdale, Trinity Bay was Lance Cove South; the name was changed around 1910 to provide distinction from the other two Lance Coves on the island.\n\nBrownsdale's first school was built in 1856 to accommodate twenty pupils. The village's first church was Wesleyan, constructed in 1870; the current church, the United Church of Brownsdale, was built in 1892. In 1958 a new high school was built and named for Newfoundland poet E. J.

It was said to be Egypt's most popular and influential political party for a period from the end of World War I through the 1930s. During this time, it was instrumental in the development of the 1923 constitution, and supported moving Egypt from dynastic rule to a constitutional monarchy, where power would be wielded by a nationally-elected parliament. The party was dissolved in 1952, after the 1952 Egyptian Revolution.\n\nThe Wafd party was an Egyptian nationalist movement that came into existence in the aftermath of World War I. Although it was not the first nationalist group in Egypt, it had the longest lasting impact. It was preceded and influenced by smaller and less significant movements which evolved over time into the more modern and stronger nationalist Wafd Party. One of these earlier movements was the Urabi Revolt led by Ahmed Urabi in the early 1880s. This uprising fought against the ruling powers of the Egyptian Khedive and European interference with Egyptian affairs. Saad Zaghloul, the future creator and leader of the Wafd Party, was a follower of Orabi, and participated in the revolt.\n\nThe actual party began taking shape during World War I and was founded in November 1918. The original members included seven prominent figures of the Egyptian landed gentry and legal profession, including their leader Saad Zaghloul. They presented themselves with Zaghloul as their representative to Reginald Wingate, the British governor in Egypt and requested to represent Egypt at the Paris Peace Conference. They told Wingate that the main goal of the Wafd was the immediate termination of the British occupation of Egypt, but not of their intention to use the Paris Peace Conference to plead their case to the world powers. Zaghloul had created a delegation that involved representatives of most of the political and social groups of Egypt. Since it was full of so many different groups, it could not yet truly be considered a political party but more of a coalition. The Wafd had formed a constitution, outlining the ways that they wished to govern Egypt.\n\nThe Wafd was denied its request to go to London and speak with the home government, nor were they allowed to attend the Paris peace conference. The Wafd counteracted this by publishing memos and giving speeches ensuring that the delegations in Paris would know what the real Egyptian delegation desired. Zaghloul became a popular figure amongst the Egyptian public and was able to arouse popular discontent at Egyptian's continued status as a British protectorate. British authorities arrested Zaghloul and three other leaders and had them exiled to the island of Malta in 1919. These deportations caused the opposite effect to that the British had hoped, and though attempts were made to keep it quiet, word spread and eventually led to a strike of law students. This strike became a demonstration with chants including \"Long live Saad. … Long live Independence\". This started the revolution of 1919, and in the following days many more began to strike and the government and courts shut down entirely. The civilian demonstrators were met with armed force by the British military which resulted in the death of over 800 Egyptians and the wounding of over 1,400 more. The British then released Saad Zaghloul and his followers, hoping to create a rift in the Wafd leadership. However, the party became more unified and the strikes continued.\n\nThe Wafd was now becoming a true party and one with widespread support of the people. The delegation made its way to Paris only to hear that U.S. President Woodrow Wilson supported the British Protectorate of Egypt. Although at this point the British were still in control, the Wafd was effectively leading the people of Egypt. In 1920, the British protectorate ended and the Wafd was placed in control of Egypt. The party rapidly became the dominant political organization in the country and was the governing party (albeit in a subordinate role to the executive power of the king) through most of the liberal period which came to an end with the rise of Gamal Abdel Nasser.\n\nThe three-decade period between Britain's nominal exit in 1922 and the nationalist revolution of 1952 saw the erection of an uneasy balance of power between the King, the British Residency, and the Wafd leadership, of which the Wafd was the least powerful. In the fragile stability of this triangle, the Wafd became Egypt's preeminent political organization, described by contemporary historians as \"the first in the field,\" \"the best organized,\" and \"the strongest numerically.\" In the 1924 parliamentary election the Wafd won 179 of 211 parliamentary seats. In 1936 it won 89% of the vote and 157 seats in Parliament.\n\nHowever, ties between the Wafd and the two other axes of power – the King and the Residency – were strained by the party's raison d'être of opposing British intervention in Egypt and the King's collusion therein. King Fuad I's relations with the Wafd were described as \"cool,\" and ties between the unelected monarch and the largest political party further deteriorated after Fuad's son Farouk, who succeeded his father to the sultanate, signed an unduly quiescent treaty with the British in 1936. This alienated the party that had arisen primarily out of popular resentment of British control of Egypt and commanded popular support by associating itself most closely with the nationalist struggle for full Egyptian independence.\n\nThe power vacuum resulting from the end of the British mandate over Egypt also precipitated a severe welfare provision vacuum which the new government failed to fill. By the 1930s, Egypt became a top destination for Christian missionary organizations, which funded and performed badly needed social services for the Egyptian middle and lower classes. Western Proselytism consortia beseeched their sponsors \"to make heavy sacrifices so that Egyptian children could have a better education than their own parents could afford\"; likewise, the proliferation of missionary-operated hospitals exposed the inadequacy of government-provided healthcare.\n\nFurther social unrest resulted from the government's inability to resolve metastasizing labor disputes threatening the Egyptian economy. The twin occurrences of the worldwide recession prompted by the Great Depression and a regional cotton crisis slowed Egypt's GDP growth through the late 1920s and most of the following two decades. The consequent instability in the labor market motivated early attempts at widespread unionization. Sensing a threat to its unrivaled power, the Wafd implemented numerous local labor conciliation boards, which were essentially toothless owing to the dearth of labor laws on a national level. Though the Wafd secured guarantees of a permanent national labor council, no significant labor laws were enacted; those that did gain passage were not enforced; and the Wafd was unable to effect any substantial change in the fiercely anti-union policy of the government.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the party's leadership had placed very low emphasis on the recruitment and mobilization of youth. Complacent in its dominant parliamentary position, the Wafd did not pursue innovative methods of youth organization until at least the mid-1930s, leaving it hopelessly behind future competitors such as the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, which had employed a far more effective local-franchising system since its inception in 1928.\n\nAfter student demonstrations against the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the anti-labor policies of the government began to reveal cracks in the previously ironclad Wafd coalition, party leaders created a youth wing dubbed the \"Blue Shirts.\" However, rather than capitalizing on the grassroots nature of the youth movements, the party instead tried to slot the Blue Shirts onto their own rung in the top-down Wafd hierarchy, presenting members with uniforms, badges, and a standardized salute – all under the motto \"Obedience & Struggle.\" By June 1937, the Wafd feared that the Blue Shirts were becoming too militant, and thereafter further restricted their privileges. Having never fully embraced youth mobilization, by the close of the 1930s the uneasy Wafd leadership had essentially abandoned any efforts at intergenerational coalition-building.\n\nEasily the greatest factor contributing to popular disillusionment with the Wafd was the party's failure to boycott the Farouk government after it acceded to the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. The policies followed by the party during the Anglo-Egyptian crisis of the mid-1930s alienated many Egyptian nationalists – heretofore the single most reliable support bloc for the Wafd – and severed the party between its small but powerful accommodationist minority and its large but voiceless resistant majority. The failure of the Wafd to more aggressively oppose the continuation of the British presence \"left Egyptian politics devoid of a popularly legitimized leader or party.\"\n\nThe collapse of the widespread popular support once commanded by the Wafd has been historically attributed to the combined embattlements of three distinct trends in Egyptian politics of the pre-revolutionary era. The party, along with all other Egyptian political parties, was banned in January 1953 by Gamal Abdel Nasser following the Free Officers Revolution of 1952.\n\n"}

The city is the third-most populous city of the archipelago and the second-most populous city of the island. La Laguna's historical center was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1999. In 2003 the municipality started an ambitious Urban Plan to renew this area, that was carried out by the firm AUC S.L. (Arquitectura Urbanismo y Cooperación). The city was the ancient capital of the Canary Islands. La Laguna lies right alongside the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife; thus, the two cities and municipalities form a single large urban center, linked by tram.\n\nThe city is home to the University of La Laguna which is home to 30,000 students; these are not included in the population figures for the city. La Laguna is considered to be the cultural capital of the Canary Islands. Also there is in the habit of being calling the \"\"Ciudad de los Adelantados\"\", for having been the first university city of the archipelago.\n\nIts economy is business-oriented while agriculture dominates the northeastern portion of the city. The urban area dominates the central and the southern parts. Tourism covers the northern coast. The main industry includes some manufacturing. The industrial area is made up of the main subdivisions of Majuelos, Las Torres de Taco, Las Mantecas and Las Chumberas. In this city one finds the legendary house of the spectre of Catalina Lercaro, as well as the incorrupt body of Sor María de Jesús, and the Christ of La Laguna (Cristo de La Laguna). Another emblematic building of the city is the Cathedral of La Laguna, which is the Catholic cathedral of Tenerife and its diocese (Diocese of Tenerife). \n\nOther important historical figures of the city were Amaro Pargo, one of the famous corsairs of the Golden Age of Piracy, and José de Anchieta, Catholic saint and missionary and founder of the cities of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.\n\nIn 2010, after a survey, La Laguna was listed as the city with the best reputation in the Canary Islands and the third provincial capital city of Spain with the best reputation, behind Gijon and Marbella.\n\nAt first the place where the town was called \"Aguere\" by the aboriginal Guanches (the name is still used in the literature). Later he founded the city as \"Villa de San Cristóbal de La Gran Laguna\" (in memory of a pond or lake that was in place). Later he established the San Cristóbal de La Laguna, and today is known simply as \"La Laguna\" (the lake).\n\nThe coat of arms was granted by Queen Joanna of Castile on 23 March 1510, as arms of the island of Tenerife. The town of La Laguna, being the capital of the island during the first times after the Conquest, adopted this emblem as its own. It features an island with a volcano spitting fire, on waves, between a castle and a lion, and above the Archangel Saint Michael, holding a spear in one hand and a shield in the other. In the border, the inscription \"Michael Arcangele Veni in Adjutorium Populo Dei Thenerife Me Fecit\". These elements symbolize the incorporation of the island of Tenerife to the Crown of Castile and its evangelization under the patronage of Saint Michael.\n\n\nOwing to its northerly aspect that captures moisture from the prevailing northeasterly winds, San Cristóbal de La Laguna has a mediterranean climate (Köppen: \"Csb\") that contrasts with the arid climate of other cities on the Canary Islands, with three to five times more rainfall than on the southern slopes, around ten percent less sunshine, and about ten percent higher humidity throughout the year. In spite of its elevation, the maritime and subtropical influences keep the temperature above frost at all times. \n\nThe place where the city is built belonged to the Menceyato de Anaga, which was one of nine aboriginal Guanche kingdoms on the island until the Kingdom of Castile's conquest. It is also known that the whole valley of Aguere (where the city lies) and especially the large lake that was in this place, was a place of pilgrimage for the aborigines of the island.\n\nThe Battle of Aguere was fought here in 1494. The city was founded between 1496 and 1497 by Alonso Fernández de Lugo and was the capital of the island after the conclusion of the conquest of the islands. Later the city also became the capital of all of the Canary Islands. In 1582, the city suffered a virulent black plague epidemic that produced between 5,000 and 9,000 deaths. \n\nThe layout of the city, its streets and its environment are elements shared with colonial cities in the Americas and Old Havana in Cuba, Lima in Peru, Cartagena de Indias in Colombia, or San Juan de Puerto Rico, among others. Since the urban plan of the city of La Laguna was the model for these Latin American cities.\n\nThe coastal area was later raided by pirates. The University of La Laguna was founded in 1701.\n\nA declining population and economy in the 18th century resulted in the transfer of the capital to Santa Cruz de Tenerife in 1723. Santa Cruz has since been the capital of the island of Tenerife and the sole capital of the Canary Islands until 1927, after which the capital of the archipelago has been shared with the city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.\n\nThe Tenerife North Airport at Los Rodeos was opened in the 1930s and is today expanding with low cost airlines using it.\n\nIt was declared a World Heritage Site on 2 December 1999. Several streets of historical significance have been closed off to automobile traffic. La Laguna has often been called the «Florence of the Canary Islands», this is due to its large number of churches and convents, as well as its old town and historic buildings. Also due to the fact that the city was the cradle or seat of different artistic and cultural movements then exported to the rest of the Canary archipelago, especially in the religious sphere as in \nHoly Week, or having been the cradle in the Canaries of the movement of the Enlightenment, also called the «Century of Lights». This favored the emergence especially in the Baroque period (XVII-XVIII centuries) of notable sculptors, painters and architects who exercised their trade in the city and sometimes exported their works to the rest of the archipelago.\n\nSeveral tunnels, passages and underground vaults dating from the immediate aftermath of the founding of the city era have recently been found. These tunnels sometimes lie under very iconic buildings such as the Iglesia de la Concepción, the Cathedral of La Laguna and the former Convent of San Agustín, among others. Researchers believe that the present city of La Laguna has been raised, because now it does not have the same ground level as at the time of its founding. In some places it is more than one meter higher and buries what is underneath.\n\n\nLa Laguna is home to some well known folklore in the Canary Islands. La Laguna has created around folklore groups.\n\nThis is a popular Romeria (pilgrimage) that is considered the most representative of the Canary Islands, which involves groups coming from all corners of the archipelago. The second Sunday of July is celebrated. She is also considered among the most important romeria in Spain.\n\nIt is celebrated every 14 September in honor of a much venerated image of Christ in the Canary Islands, the Cristo de La Laguna. For this event come people from all over the archipelago. It is the leading holidays in town.\n\nHoly Week in the city of San Cristóbal de la Laguna is the largest of the Canary Islands. Holy Week has steps of great historical and artistic value, such as the aforementioned Cristo de La Laguna, accompanied by their guilds, some of them centuries old and which adopted the use of the hood in the nineteenth century, ride on the wheeled carts streets of the city.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He can play as a right-sided full back or central defender.\n\nHe initially started playing in Tranmere Rovers' academy while attending Calday Grange Grammar School before joining Liverpool.\n\nRaven made his first team debut with a man-of-the-match display during the League Cup quarter-final win against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane in December 2004 and went on to play in two further games: disappointing defeats to Burnley in the FA Cup Third Round and Southampton in the Barclays Premiership. He had also played in the pre-season match against Wrexham in August 2004.\n\nHe featured in a number of games at centre-half for the reserves throughout 2004 but manager Rafael Benítez, having been impressed since his arrival in the summer, saw his best position as right-back. He became the regular captain of Liverpool's reserve team.\nRaven spent the latter part of the 2005–06 season on loan at Tranmere Rovers.\n\nRaven then moved to Carlisle United from Liverpool on a free transfer but his debut lasted only half-an-hour before he was substituted because of injury.\n\nAfter an injury-plagued first season at Carlisle, 2007–08 was a different story for Raven, as he established himself as Carlisle's first choice right-back. He also won the club's 'Most Improved Player of the Year' award. During this season he also scored his first goal for Carlisle when he netted against Orient.\n\nRaven signed for Shrewsbury Town in July 2010 on a one-year contract.\n\nHaving been released from Carlisle United, new Shrewsbury Town manager Graham Turner announced Raven as his second permanent signing. After another injury plagued, yet consistent season when playing, Raven was released by the club in May 2011.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, he returned to former 'loan' club Tranmere Rovers on trial, playing in a pre-season tie against Colwyn Bay. He signed for the club but was subsequently released at the end of the 2011–12 season after making 17 league appearances.\n\nHe signed for SPL side Inverness Caledonian Thistle in June 2012. He made his debut in a 2–1 friendly win over Buckie Thistle. His SPL debut came against St Mirren in a 2–2 draw.\n\nRaven scored his first goal for \"ICT\" when he opened the scoring in a 3–0 Highland derby win against Ross County in February 2014. His third career goal was an extra-time winner against Celtic, in the 2014–15 Scottish Cup semi-final at Hampden Park, Glasgow, on Sunday 19 April 2015. On 30 April Inverness CT announced that Raven had signed a one-year contract extension, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2015–16 season. Inverness won the 2014–15 Scottish Cup, but Raven missed the cup final due to injury.\n\nJust before December 2017, David Raven confirmed that he would be leaving the club for greener pastures, due to the fact of the club being in debt and being unable to afford several high earning players' wages. Raven was one on the list that they couldn't afford. He also admitted that he wanted to start coaching with the highland club.\n\nOn 2 January 2018, Raven played his final home game for Inverness in a 1–1 draw with Livingston in the 2017–18 Scottish Championship. His final game for Caley Thistle came four days later in a 1–0 loss to St Mirren.\n\nOn 26 January 2018, Raven joined Wrexham and made his debut the following day in a 2–2 draw against former club Tranmere Rovers and alongside former Inverness teammate Scott Boden. Raven was released by Wrexham in May 2018.\n\nOn 1 July 2018, Raven joined Northern Premier League side, Warrington Town, after almost 2 months without a club. He made two appearances for the club in the FA Cup against Halifax Town in the initial 2–2 draw on 20 October 2018, and the 2–0 loss in the replay three days later.\n"}

At 18, Cohen joined the IDF's \"Nachal\" singers group. During the 1970s Cohen was one of the most played singers in Israel.

{"id": "2213921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213921", "title": "Online gambling", "text": "Online gambling\n\nOnline gambling (or Internet gambling) is any kind of gambling conducted on the internet. This includes virtual poker, casinos and sports betting. The first online gambling venue opened to the general public, was ticketing for the Liechtenstein International Lottery in October 1994. Today the market is worth around $40 billion globally each year, according to various estimates.\n\nMany countries restrict or ban online gambling. However it is legal in some states of the United States, some provinces in Canada, most countries of the European Union and several nations in the Caribbean.\n\nIn many legal markets, online gambling service providers are required by law to have some form of licence if they wish to provide services or advertise to residents there. For example, the United Kingdom Gambling Commission or the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board in the USA. \n\nMany online casinos and gambling companies around the world choose to base themselves in tax havens near to their main markets. These destinations include Gibraltar, Malta and Alderney in Europe, and in Asia, the Special Administrative Region of Macau was long considered a tax haven and known base for gambling operators in the region. However, in 2018 the EU removed Macau from their list of black-listed tax havens.\n\nIn 1994, Antigua and Barbuda passed the Free Trade & Processing Act, allowing licences to be granted to organisations applying to open online casinos. Before online casinos, the first fully functional gambling software was developed by Microgaming, an Isle of Man-based software company. This was secured with software developed by CryptoLogic, an online security software company. Safe transactions became viable; this led to the first online casinos in 1994.\n\n1996 saw the establishment of the Kahnawake Gaming Commission, which regulated online gaming activity from the Mohawk Territory of Kahnawake and issues gaming licences to many of the world's online casinos and poker rooms. This is an attempt to keep the operations of licensed online gambling organisations fair and transparent.\n\nIn the late 1990s, online gambling gained popularity; there were only fifteen gambling websites in 1996, but that had increased to 200 websites by the following year. A report published by Frost & Sullivan revealed that online gambling revenues had exceeded $830 million in 1998 alone. In the same year the first online poker rooms were introduced. Soon afterwards in 1999, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act was introduced as a bill in the US Senate; it would have meant that a company could not offer any online gambling product to any U.S citizen. But it did not pass. Multiplayer online gambling was also introduced in 1999.\n\nIn 2000, the first Australian Federal Government passed the Interactive Gambling Moratorium Act, making it illegal for any online casino not licensed and operating before May 2000 to operate. This meant Lasseter's Online became the only online casino able to operate legally in Australia; however, they cannot take bets from Australian citizens.\n\nBy 2001, the estimated number of people who had participated in online gambling rose to 8 million, and growth continued, despite continuing legal challenges to online gambling.\n\nIn 2008, H2 Gambling Capital estimated worldwide online gambling revenue at $21 billion.\n\nIn 2016, Statista predicted that the online gambling market would reach $45.86 billion, growing to $56.05 billion by 2018.\n\nThe Internet has allowed new types of gambling to be available on line. Improvements in technology have changed betting habits just as video lottery terminals, keno and scratchcards changed the gambling industry in the 20th century.\n\nGambling has become one of the most popular and lucrative businesses on the Internet. In 2007 the UK Gambling Commission stated that the gambling industry had achieved a turnover of over £84 billion. This is partly due to the wide range of gambling options available to many different types of people. An article by Darren R. Christensen, Nicki A. Dowling, Alun C. Jackson and Shane A. Thomas said that a survey recorded in Australia showed that the most common forms of gambling were lotteries (46.5%), keno (24.3%), instant scratch tickets (24.3%), and electronic gaming machines (20.5%).\n\nOnline poker tables commonly offer Texas hold 'em, Omaha, Seven-card stud, razz, HORSE and other game types in both tournament and Cash game structures. Players play against each other rather than the \"house\", with the card room making its money through \"rake\" and through tournament fees.\n\nThere are a large number of online casinos in which people can play casino games such as roulette, blackjack, pachinko, baccarat and many others. These games are played against the \"house\" which makes money because the odds are in its favor.\n\nSports betting is the activity of predicting sports results and placing a wager on the outcome. Usually the wager is in the form of money.\n\nOnline bingo is the game of bingo (US|non-US) played on the Internet.\n\nMost lotteries are run by governments and are heavily protected from competition due to their ability to generate large taxable cash flows. The first online lotteries were run by private individuals or companies and licensed to operate by small countries. Most private online lotteries have stopped trading as governments have passed new laws giving themselves and their own lotteries greater protection. Government-controlled lotteries now offer their games online.\n\nThe UK National Lottery started in 1994 and is operated by the Camelot Group. Around 70% of UK adults play the National Lottery regularly, making the average annual sales over £5 billion apart from the year 2000-01 where sales dropped just below that. In its first seventeen years it has created over 2,800 millionaires.\n\nIn 2002 Camelot decided to rebrand the National Lottery main draw after falling ticket sales. The name National Lottery was kept as the general name for the organisation and the main draw was renamed Lotto. The advertising campaign for the new Lotto cost £72 million which included ten television advertisements featuring Scottish comedian Billy Connolly and one of the largest ever poster campaigns. The new brand and name had the slogan:\n\nHorse racing betting comprises a significant percentage of online gambling wagers and all major Internet bookmakers, betting exchanges, and sports books offer a wide variety of horse racing betting markets.\n\nHorse wagering using online methods across state lines is legal in several states in the United States. In 2006, the NTRA and various religious organizations lobbied in support of an act in Congress meant to limit online gambling. Some critics of the bill argued that the exemption of horse racing wagering was an unfair loophole. In response, the NTRA responded that the exemption was \"a recognition of existing federal law\", not a new development. Interstate wagering on horse racing was first made legal under the Interstate Horseracing Act written in 1978. The bill was rewritten in the early 2000s to include the Internet in closed-circuit websites, including simulcast racing, as compared to simply phones or other forms of communication.\n\nMobile gambling refers to playing games of chance or skill for money by using a remote device such as a tablet computer, smartphone or a mobile phone with a wireless Internet connection.\n\nIn-play gambling is a feature on many online sports betting websites that allows the user to bet while the event is in progress. A benefit of live in-play gambling is that there are much more markets. For example, in Association football a user could bet on which player will receive the next Yellow card, or which team will be awarded the next corner kick.\n\nAdvance-deposit wagering (ADW) is a form of gambling on the outcome of horse races in which the bettor must fund his or her account before being allowed to place bets. ADW is often conducted online or by phone. In contrast to ADW, credit shops allow wagers without advance funding; accounts are settled at month-end. Racetrack owners, horse trainers and state governments sometimes receive a share of ADW revenues.\n\nThe money for online gambling can come from credit card, electronic check, certified check, money order, wire transfer, or cryptocurrencies. Normally, gamblers upload funds to the online gambling company, make bets or play the games that it offers, and then cash out any winnings. Gamblers can often fund gambling accounts by credit card or debit card, and cash out winnings directly back to the card; most U.S. banks, however, prohibit the use of their cards for the purpose of Internet gambling, and attempts by Americans to use credit cards at Internet gambling sites are usually rejected. A number of electronic money services offer accounts with which online gambling can be funded.\n\nMany of the companies operating out of the island nation of Antigua and Barbuda are publicly traded on various stock exchanges, specifically the London Stock Exchange. Antigua has met British regulatory standards and has been added to the UK's \"white list\", which allows licensed Antiguan companies to advertise in the UK.\n\nThe national government, which licenses Internet gambling entities, made a complaint to the World Trade Organization about the U.S. government's actions to impede online gaming. The Caribbean country won the preliminary ruling but WTO's appeals body somewhat narrowed that favorable ruling in April 2005. The appeals decision held that various state laws argued by Antigua and Barbuda to be contrary to the WTO agreements were not sufficiently discussed during the course of the proceedings to be properly assessed by the panel. However, the appeals panel also ruled that the Wire Act and two other federal statutes prohibiting the provision of gambling services from Antigua to the United States violated the WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services. Although the United States convinced the appeals panel that these laws were \"necessary\" to protect public health and morals, the asserted United States defense on these grounds was ultimately rejected because its laws relating to remote gambling on horse-racing were not applied equally to foreign and domestic online betting companies, and thus the United States could not establish that its laws were non-discriminatory.\n\nOn 30 March 2007, the WTO confirmed that the U.S. \"had done nothing to abide by an earlier verdict that labeled some U.S. Internet gambling restrictions as illegal.\"\n\nOn 19 June 2007, Antigua and Barbuda filed a claim with the WTO for US$3.4 billion in trade sanctions against the United States, and in particular, the ability for the country to suspend its enforcement of U.S. copyrights and patents and a punitive measure. On 28 January 2013, the WTO authorized the ability for Antigua and Bermuda to monetize and exploit U.S. copyrights as compensation for the country's actions; the country planned to form \"a statutory body to own, manage and operate the ultimate platform to be created for the monetisation or other exploitation of the suspension of American intellectual property rights\".\n\nOn 28 June 2001 the Australian Government passed the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 (IGA). The government said that the IGA was important to protect Australians from the harmful effects of gambling. The offense applies to all interactive gambling service providers, whether based in Australia or offshore, whether Australian or foreign owned. The IGA makes it an offence to provide an interactive gambling service to a customer physically present in Australia, but it is not an offence for Australian residents to play poker or casino games online. Sports betting online is legal in Australia, with many state government licensed sportsbooks in operation.\n\nWhile the criminal code of Canada does not prohibit online gambling, it does prohibit any type of gambling at an establishment not owned or licensed by a provincial government. Not withstanding this fact, there are an estimated 1,200 to 1,400 offshore websites that make casino type games and other gambling activities available to Canadians. For online gambling operations within Canada's borders, the Canadian authorities are willing to prosecute, but as of this date, have only done so once, when British Columbia prosecuted Starnet Communications International (\"SCI\"), a Delaware corporation, run by residents of Vancouver, where one of the company's servers was located. The court found that SCI had sufficient contact with Canada to be prosecuted under its criminal code. SCI was fined $100,000 and forfeited nearly $4 million in profits. It has since moved its operations overseas.\n\nIn 2004, the British Columbia Lottery Corporation launched Canada's first legal online casino, PlayNow.com, which makes legal online gambling available to residents of British Columbia and Manitoba. A survey conducted in 2007 showed that only about 2.3% of Canadians reported participating in online gambling. However, in 2012, Manitoba Lotteries Minister Steve Ashton estimated that gamblers in Manitoba alone were spending $37 million a year at illegal online casinos. Quebec's lottery organization Loto-Quebec launched a similar service, known as Espacejeux.\n\nAccording to John A. Cunningham, Joanne Cordingley, David C. Hodgins and Tony Toneatto a telephone survey was recorded in Ontario that shows there was a strong agreement that conceptions of gambling abuse as a disease or addiction were positively associated with belief that treatment is needed, while there was a strong agreement that disease or wrongdoing were positively associated with the belief that abstinence is required.\n\nOn 5 March 2009, France proposed new laws to regulate and tax Internet gambling. Budget minister Eric Woerth stated the French gambling market would expand to adapt to \"Internet reality.\" He further stated \"Rather than banning 25,000 websites, we'd rather give licenses to those who will respect public and social order.\" Betting exchanges, however, will remain illegal under the new plans.\n\nThe German Interstate Treaty on gaming, which came into force on 1 January 2008, banned all forms of online gaming and betting in the country, with the exception of wagers on horse racing. The European Gaming & Betting Association turned to the European Commission with the request to take action against the German legislation, because such stringent legislation violated EU rules. In 2010, the European Court of Justice ruled that the monopolised gambling industry in Germany has to be liberalised. Schleswig-Holstein is the only German state that has already come up with their own gambling bill allowing gambling online. From 2012, casino operators can apply for an online gambling license in this state.\n\nOnline gambling is illegal in the state of Maharashtra under the \"Bombay Wager Act\". Other acts/legislations are silent with respect to online gambling/online gaming in India. The most recent law to address gambling online was the Federal Information Technology Rules where such illegal activities may be blocked by Internet providers within India. Another act is the Public Gaming Act of 1867. States tend to operate on their own authority.\n\nOnline gambling legal issues in India are complicated in nature as Gambling in India is regulated by different states laws and online gambling is a central subject. To ascertain the position of Indian government, the Supreme Court of India sought the opinion of central government in this regard but the same was declined by the central government. This has made playing of online cards games like rummy, poker, etc. legally risky. Playing Rummy in India is legal as according to the verdict of Supreme Court of India, Rummy is a Game of skills and cannot be considered as Gambling. \n\nOn 3 September 2015, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) issued a Circular titled \"Clarification on Tax Compliance for Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets\" under the black money act which directs the online poker players in the country to declare their money transactions on foreign poker sites through the e-wallets and virtual cards.\n\nThe Israel gambling law (Israeli Penal Law 5737 - 1977) does not refer specifically to online gambling (land based gambling and playing games of chances is prohibited except in the cases of the Israel Lottery and the Israeli Commission for Sports Gambling). In December 2005, the attorney general ordered all online gambling operations, online backgammon included, to close their businesses and at the same time commanded credit card companies to cease cooperating with online gambling websites. In May 2007, the attorney general had excluded the online backgammon website Play65 from the ruling, due to \"the unique circumstances of the site's activity\", allowing it to return to full activity in Israel.\n\nIn 2012, the Tel Aviv Police Commander ordered local ISPs to block access to several online gambling sites. The District Court invalidated this order. The Supreme Court dismissed an appeal in 2013, finding that the police do not have legal authority to issue such orders. The government responded by proposing a bill that will authorize such orders, referring to child pornography, drug trafficking and online gambling websites.\n\nIn December 2016 the amendment to the Polish Gambling Act was scheduled to come into force on 1 April 2017. Online gambling will be only possible on the sites with Polish license.\n\nRussian legislation, enacted in December 2006, prohibits online gambling altogether (as well as any gambling relying on telecommunications technology).\n\nIn 2014, the Singapore parliament tabled the Remote Gambling Bill as a counter-measure against online gambling locally, while parliamentary member Denise Phua spoke against legalised gambling in Singapore.\n\nGambling was prohibited in Ukraine in 2009 after a fire occurred in an illegal gambling hall in Dnipro (former Dnipropetrovsk), in which nine people died. \n\nThe Law On Prohibition of Gambling Business, signed by then President of the Ukraine Viktor Yushchenko, made all forms of gambling, including slots machines, bookmaking and online gambling illegal in Ukraine.\n\nIn August 2019, the President of the Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi proclaimed the intention to legalise gambling, as its restoration may positively impact on the financial situation in the country. \n\nDespite the 2009 law, many venues continued to operate using legal loopholes for many years. Over 900 such gambling operations were closed down in preparation for a legalised market.\n\nOn January the 24th 2020, legislators in the Verkhovna Rada passed the first stage of the law to reintroduce legal gambling in Ukraine.\n\nIn 2003 Tessa Jowell, then Culture Secretary suggested a change in the British Gambling laws to keep up with advances in technology.\n\nThe Bill identified updates to the laws already in place in the UK, and also created the UK Gambling Commission to take over from the Gambling Board. The commission will have the power to prosecute any parties in breach of the guidelines set out by the bill and will be tasked with regulating any codes of practice they set forward. The Bill set out its licensing objectives, which are as follows:\n\n\nThe Bill also set out guidelines stating that gambling will be unlawful in the UK unless granted a licence, permit or registration. It outlined the penalty for being in breach of these guidelines, that being a maximum of six months in prison, a fine, or both for each offence. Any person under 18 will not be allowed to gamble and it is an offence to invite or permit anyone under the age of 18 years to gamble.\n\nLegislation on online gambling in the United States was first drafted in the late 1990s. Bob Goodlatte and Jon Kyl introduced bills to the Senate that would curb online gambling activities except for those that involved horse and dog races and state lotteries. Those bills however were not passed.\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled in November 2002 that the Federal Wire Act prohibits electronic transmission of information for sports betting across telecommunications lines but affirmed a lower court ruling that the Wire Act \"'in plain language' does not prohibit Internet gambling on a game of chance.\" But the federal Department of Justice continues, publicly, to take the position that the Wire Act covers all forms of gambling.\n\nIn April 2004 Google and Yahoo!, the two largest Internet search engines, announced that they were removing online gambling advertising from their sites. The move followed a United States Department of Justice announcement that, in what some say is a contradiction of the Appeals Court ruling, the Wire Act relating to telephone betting applies to all forms of Internet gambling, and that any advertising of such gambling \"may\" be deemed as aiding and abetting. Critics of the Justice Department's move say that it has no legal basis for pressuring companies to remove advertisements and that the advertisements are protected by the First Amendment. In April 2005, Yahoo! has instigated a restrictive policy about gambling ads.\n\nIn July 2006, David Carruthers, the CEO of BetonSports, a company publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange, was detained in Texas while changing planes on his way from London to Costa Rica. He and ten other individuals had been previously charged in a sealed indictment with violations of US federal laws relating to illegal gambling. While as noted above, a United States Appeals court has stated that the Wire Act does not apply to non-sports betting, the Supreme Court of the United States previously refused to hear an appeal of the conviction of Jay Cohen, where lower courts held that the Wire Act does make it illegal to own a sports betting operation that offers such betting to United States citizens.\n\nThe BetOnSports indictment alleged violations of at least nine different federal statutes, including 18 USC Sec. 1953 (Operation of an Illegal Gambling Business). Carruthers is currently under house arrest on a one million dollar bail bond.\n\nIn September 2006, Sportingbet reported that its chairman, Peter Dicks, was detained in New York City on a Louisiana warrant while traveling in the United States on business unrelated to online gaming. Louisiana is one of the few states that has a specific law prohibiting gambling online. At the end of the month, New York dismissed the Louisiana warrant.\n\nAlso in September 2006, just before adjourning for the midterm elections, both the House of Representatives and Senate passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (as a section of the unrelated SAFE Port Act) to make transactions from banks or similar institutions to online gambling sites illegal. This differed from a previous bill passed only by the House that expanded the scope of the Wire Act. The passed bill only addressed banking issues. The Act was signed into law on 13 October 2006, by President George W. Bush. At the UIGEA bill-signing ceremony, Bush did not mention the Internet gambling measure, which was supported by the National Football League but opposed by banking groups. The regulation called for in the UIGEA was issued in November 2008.\n\nIn April 2007, Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) introduced HR 2046, the Internet Gambling Regulation, Consumer Protection, and Enforcement Act, which would modify UIGEA by providing a provision for licensing of Internet gambling facilities by the director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Several similar bills have been introduced since then in the House and Senate.\n\nIn June 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice seized over $34 million belonging to over 27,000 accounts in the Southern District of New York Action Against Online Poker Players. This is the first time money was seized from individual players as compared to the gaming company. Jeff Ifrah, the lawyer for one of the account management companies affected, said that the government \"has never seized an account that belongs to players who are engaged in what [Ifrah] would contend is a lawful act of playing peer-to-peer poker online.\"\n\nOn 3 December 2009, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on UIGEA and Rep. Frank's Internet Gambling Regulation, Consumer Protection, and Enforcement Act of 2009 (H.R. 2267) where experts in the fields of online security and consumer safety testified that a regulatory framework for Internet gambling would protect consumers and ensure the integrity of Internet gambling financial transactions. On 28 July 2010, the committee passed H.R. 2267 by a vote of 41-22-1. The bill would legalize and regulate online poker and some other forms of online gambling.\n\nOn 22 November 2010, the New Jersey state Senate became the first such US body to pass a bill (S490) expressly legalizing certain forms of online gambling. The bill was passed with a 29–5 majority. The bill allows bets to be taken by in-State companies on poker games, casino games and slots but excludes sports betting, although it allows for the latter to be proposed, voted on and potentially regulated separately in due course. However, a Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll in April 2009 showed only 26% of New Jersey voters approved of online sports-betting. On a national level, two-thirds (67%) of voters polled by PublicMind in March 2010 opposed changing the law to allow online betting. Men were more likely than women (29–14%) and liberals more likely than conservatives (27–18%) to approve of changing the law to allow online betting.\nIn May 2012, FDU's PublicMind conducted a follow up study which asked voters if they favored or opposed online gaming/gambling and \"allowing New Jersey casinos to run betting games online, over the Internet.\" The results showed that (31%) of voters favored while a sizable majority (58%) opposed the idea. Peter Woolley, director of the PublicMind, commented on the results: \"Online gambling may be a good bet for new state revenue, but lots of voters don't think it's a good bet for New Jersey households.\"\n\nOn 15 April 2011, in \"U. S. v. Scheinberg et al. (10 Cr. 336)\", three online poker companies were indicted for violating U.S. laws that prohibit the acceptance of any financial instrument in connection with unlawful Internet gambling, that is, Internet gambling that involves a \"bet or wager\" that is illegal under the laws of the state where the bet is made. The indictment alleges that the companies used fraudulent methods to evade this law, for example, by disguising online gambling payments as purchases of merchandise, and by investing money in a local bank in return for the bank's willingness to process online poker transactions. The companies argue that poker is a game of skill rather than a game of chance, and therefore, online poker is not unlawful Internet gambling. There are other legal problems with the government's case, and the indictments did not mention the Wire Act. On 31 July 2012, it was announced that two of the three companies indicted for money laundering and forfeiture settled with the Manhattan U.S. Attorney for $731 million without legally admitting guilt. The government also asked the judge to approve a settlement with the third defendant, Absolute Poker. In March 2016, PokerStars spokesman Eric Hollreiser said his company finally had established an important beachhead in the U.S. market by being able to operate legally in New Jersey.\n\nThe Bill defined remote gambling as,\n\nThis would be using the internet, the telephone, radio, television of any other device used for communication. Any operator must have a separate licence for remote gambling and non-remote gambling. The licence must state what form the remote gambling would come in and any conditions appropriate to each operator. Offences for breaching remote gambling guidelines are the same as breaching non-remote gambling guidelines.\n\nVarious forms of online gambling are legal and regulated in many countries, including some provinces in Canada, most members of the European Union and several nations in and around the Caribbean Sea.\n\nIn the UK, between 2009 and 2010, 4% of adults had bet online. Between April 2010 and March 2011, online gambling which is regulated by the UK Gambling Commission yielded £660.74 million, a 5% increase on the previous year. The British regulated online gambling sector was worth a 12% market share of the British regulated gambling industry within the same time period. Most British consumer online gambling activity is on overseas regulated websites, and estimates place the UK consumer market for online gambling at £1.9 billion for 2010. (Approximately three times the size of the British regulated market). In the year to March 2011, 5000 adults were surveyed and reported that 11.2% of them had participated in at least one form of remote gambling in the previous four weeks. Approximately half of the respondents had only participated in National Lottery products. Another group of interviews conducted by the Gambling Commission.\n\nIn March 2011, the UK online gambling industry employed 6,077 full-time employees. A number that has declined since 2008 where 8,918 full-time employees were in employment within the industry. Also, there were 291 remote gambling activity licences held by 225 operators at this date. Three of the sectors within online gambling are betting, bingo and casino which between them turned over £13,456.07 million between April 2010 and March 2011. During this time period, betting turned over a substantial proportion of this amount, turning over £13,081.44 million, with bingo and casino turning over £26.75 million and £347.87 million respectively.\n\nAccording to the European Gaming and Betting Association (EGBA), online gambling is a growing sector within the EU, with gross gaming revenue (GGR) expected to reach €29.3 billion in 2022. According to EGBA, the EU online gambling market was valued at €22.2 billion GGR in 2018 - growing 11% from €20 billion GGR in 2017 - and accounted for 49.2% of the global online gambling market. The EU online gambling channelled or white market accounted for €15.9bn, reflecting an average EU-wide channelling rate of 71.7%. Online gambling now represents 23.2% of the total EU gambling market activity, while offline gambling (lotteries, casinos, bookmakers shops, etc) had a total GGR of €73.5bn, accounting for 76.8% of the overall EU gambling market. In 2018, the UK market (34.2%) accounted for the largest portion of the EU online gambling market, based on GGR, followed by Germany (11.1%), France (8.8%) and Italy (8.1%).\n\nA 2015 review found evidence of higher rates of mental health comorbidites, as well as higher amounts of substance use, amongst internet gamblers, compared to non internet gamblers. Causation, however, has not been established, and the review postulated the there may differences in the cohorts between internet and land-based problem gamblers.\n\nIn the United States in 1999 the National Gambling Impact Study stated \"the high-speed instant gratification of Internet games and the high level of privacy they offer may exacerbate problem and pathological gambling\". A UK government-funded review of previous research noted a small scale patient survey leading to press reports claiming that 75% of people who gamble online are \"problem\" or \"pathological\" gamblers, compared to just 20% of people who visit legitimate land-based casinos.\n\nA study by the UK Gambling Commission, the \"British Gambling Prevalence Survey 2010\", found that approximately 0.9% of the adult population had problem gambling issues, more than shown in a previous study in 2007. The highest prevalence of problem gambling was found among those who participated in playing Poker at a pub or club (20.3%), Dog races (19.2%) and online slot machine style or instant win games (17%). Additionally the report noted a 15% increase in overall gambling since 2007, from a rate of 58% in 2007 to 73% in 2010. Significantly, the 2010 prevalence survey notes that whilst the overall gambling figure had increased, the prevalence among men at 75% was not dissimilar to the amounts in two previous surveys in 1999 and 2007 which were 76% and 71% respectively. However, the prevalence among women for 2010 was 71%, which was higher than 68% in 1999 and 65% in 2007.\n\nIn August 2014 the National Council of Problem Gambling (NCPG) partnered with the Gambling Integrity Services (GIS). The GIS will evaluate these recently regulated internet gambling operators in order to ensure they comply with NCPG's internet Responsible Gambling Standards.\n\nA study released by the University of Buffalo in November 2014 states that the explosion of online gambling in the United States in the past decade has not given rise to more people with gambling problems.\n\nAccording to Darren R. Christensen, Nicki A. Dowling, Alun C. Jackson and Shane A. Thomas a survey recorded in Australia shows that gambling severity rates were estimated at non-gambling (34.8%), non-problem gambling (57.4%), low risk gambling (5.3%), moderate risk (1.8%) and problem gambling (0.7%).\n\nIt has also been alleged that the largely unsupervised electronic funds transfers inherent in online gambling are being exploited by criminal interests to launder large amounts of money. However, according to a US GAO study, \"Banking and gaming regulatory officials did not view Internet gambling as being particularly susceptible to money laundering, especially when credit cards, which create a transaction record and are subject to relatively low transaction limits, were used for payment. Likewise, credit card and gaming industry officials did not believe Internet gambling posed any particular risks in terms of money laundering.\"\n\nIn 2011, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York filed \"United States v. Scheinberg\", a federal criminal case against the founders of the three largest online poker companies, PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Cereus Poker Network (Absolute Poker/Ultimatebet), and a handful of their associates, which alleges that the defendants violated the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act and engaged in bank fraud and money laundering in order to process transfers to and from their customers.\n\nA BBC investigation in 2019 described how cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin were being used for under-age gambling, money-laundering and political corruption in the Caribbean island of Curaçao. \n\nDue to the virtual nature of online gambling, it is hard for players to verify the authenticity of sites they are using. Unlike in physical casinos, randomness and deck shuffling cannot be verified by visual means unless the casino is provably fair. Players interact with other players through GUIs, which connect to the gambling site's server in a non-transparent manner. Players' attitudes towards sites plays an important role in online purchases and customer loyalty. Lack of trust in payment systems and security are primary reasons for avoiding online gambling. In an online survey of 10,838 online casino and poker players from over 96 countries, respondents reported a high level of mistrust of online gambling. 91.5% believed that reputable third party reports on randomness and payouts were important to gain their trust. However, contrasting research shows that seals-of-approval granted by these third parties does not have a strong influence on purchasing behavior, nor are customers usually aware of their existence.\n\nResponsible Gambling Features (RGFs) are features that online gambling sites use to promote responsible behavior and reduce harm. These include limiting amounts that can be bet or deposited over a designated period of time, self-assessment tests for gambling problems, and warning signs of prolonged play or high expenditure. RGFs are usually opt-in features for players and are required by certain jurisdictions. For example, operators in Denmark, Germany, and Spain must provide deposit limits, but this is only voluntary for Australian operators. A sample of online poker players from Sweden indicated that RGFs increase their trust in a company and reduce their anxiety about winning from other players. However, in jurisdictions that mandate Responsible Gambling Features, only a small percentage of customers use them. In Australia, 0.8% used the deposit limit on SportsBet and 6% used deposit loss limits on BetFair Australia.\n\n"}

It is on the north-east fringe of Greater London.\n\nWeald manor, parts of which dated to the 16th century, was bought by Sir Anthony Browne in 1547 and he died at Weald Hall in 1567. In 1685, Erasmus Smith bought it from Sir William Scroggs. The current layout is largely the result of landscaping carried out in the naturalistic manner of Capability Brown for Hugh Smith, lord of the manor from 1732 to 1745. In 1752, the estate was sold to Thomas Tower of Iver in Buckinghamshire, a lawyer and MP for Wareham in Dorset. Christopher Tower succeeded as the owner in 1778 and immediately commissioned Robert Adam to design a new dining room. On his death in 1810, his son, Christopher Thomas Tower, succeeded until 1867; he enlarged the estate and enclosed some commons as \"waste\".\n\nThe park is now managed by Essex County Council.\n\nWeald Hall, with in 1841, was let to farmers in the 19th century sold by another C. T. Tower in 1946, when the estate was broken up though part of the park was retained for the Green Belt of London. Some remnants remain of the Hall, which was demolished in 1950–51 due to war damage, in particular some steps leading to what used to be a folly in the park. The 16th-century lodge miscalled \"Queen Mary's Chapel\" because it was locally rumoured to have been used by Queen Mary for quiet prayer and contemplation, which used to be enclosed within Weald Hall's walled kitchen garden, still remains at the edge of the park.\n\nA very large (2.8 by 4.8 metres) painting of Weald Hall hung in a dining room at nearby Brentwood School. Depicting the house and park before 18th Century alterations it is attributed to Dutch painter Jan Griffier the Elder (1652-1718). The school, which was founded by a former owner of the Hall, Sir Anthony Browne, sold the painting to a private collector at Sotheby's in November 1985.\n\nThe park was due to be the venue for the mountain biking events at the 2012 Summer Olympics. However, following a visit by inspectors from the Union Cycliste Internationale, the site was considered insufficiently challenging for international competition and a new venue was sought. Hadleigh Country Park was chosen as the replacement venue.\n\nBrentwood Parkrun is one of the many Parkrun events that run every Saturday at 9am across the world. It is a 5km run and is timed and results are recorded on the central Parkrun database. The event was set-up under the guidance of Leigh Norris (who is the current event director), with the first event taking place on 6 December 2014. As at the beginning of 2017 there had been 105 weekly events with the largest number of runners totaling 185 for the 2016 Christmas event.\n\nThe course is considered one of the hardest in the South East and attracts runners beyond Brentwood because of its challenge. It has two significant hills, one famously called Heartbreak Hill which runners face at 4km. The course is hilly, single lap, and has cross-country terrain including grass, paths and woods. In the winter, the course can get very muddy and trail shoes are required. In the summer, the course can be hard and dry and running trainers are suitable.\n\n"}
{"id": "2213932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213932", "title": "Karl Emil Franzos", "text": "Karl Emil Franzos\n\nKarl Emil Franzos (October 25, 1848January 28, 1904) was a popular Austrian novelist of the late 19th century. His works, both reportage and fiction, concentrate on the multi-ethnic corner of Galicia, Podolia and Bukovina, now largely in Ukraine, where the Habsburg and Russian empires met. This area became so closely associated with his name that one critic called it \"Franzos country\". A number of his books were translated into English, and Gladstone is said to have been among his admirers.\n\nKarl Emil Franzos was born near the town of Czortków (Chortkiv) in the eastern, Podolian region of the Austrian Kingdom of Galicia. His family came from Sephardi Spanish Jews who fled the Inquisition to Holland and later settled in Lorraine. In the 1770s his great-grandfather established a factory for one of his sons in East Galicia, part of the Habsburg Monarchy since the First Partition of Poland in 1772. When the Austrian administration required Jews to adopt surnames, \"Franzos\" became his grandfather's name, from his French background, even though he regarded himself as German.\n\nFranzos's father Heinrich (1808–1858) was a highly respected doctor in Czortków. His German identity at the time had mainly linguistic and cultural meaning, there being no state called \"Germany\", just a loose German Confederation. He was steeped in the humanistic ideals of the German Enlightenment as expressed by Kant, Lessing and, especially, Schiller. This brought a certain isolation: for local Poles and Ukrainians he was German, for Germans a Jew and for Jews a renegade, a \"deutsch\". In the \"Vormärz\" era of the first half of the 19th century, liberalism and nationalism went hand in hand, and Franzos's father was one of the first Jews to join a \"Burschenschaft\" student fraternity whose ideal was a German nation state with a liberal constitution. It is ironic that by the time Franzos, who shared his father's ideals, went to university, the German student fraternities had \"dejudaised\" themselves.\n\nHis father died when he was ten and his mother moved to the Bukovina capital Czernowitz (Chernivtsi). The city's multiculturalism, representative of the Habsburg Empire, strongly influenced his youth and character. The first languages he spoke were Ukrainian and Polish, learnt from his nurse; his first school was attached to the Czortków Dominican abbey, where the teaching was in Latin and Polish; and he attended private lessons in Hebrew. In Czernowitz he attended the German \"gymnasium\", passing the \"Matura\" exam with honours in 1867. By now the family was in reduced circumstances and he supported himself by giving lessons, later, as a student, from his writing.\n\nHe would have liked to study classical philology with the aim of becoming a teacher, but no scholarship was forthcoming. Jews were not eligible for teaching posts, and even though he was non-religious, he refused to convert to advance his career. An additional reason for the refusal of a scholarship was that he did not attempt to conceal his liberal outlook, having, for example, tried to organise a celebration for the liberal poet, Ferdinand Freiligrath. He studied law at the universities of Vienna and Graz, that being a shorter course. When he graduated, he found himself in a similar situation: he did not want to become an advocate, and a position as judge was closed to him as a Jew.\n\nHaving had a number of pieces published while he was a student, he went into journalism and worked for newspapers and magazines for the rest of his life, at first in Budapest and in Vienna as a travel writer of the \"Neue Freie Presse\" newspaper. In 1877 he married Ottilie Benedikt, a relative of editor Moriz Benedikt. From 1886 he lived in Berlin, capital of the German Empire. Franzos had acclaimed the 1871 German unification under Prussian leadership and advocated a Greater Germany including the Austrian territories. However, the move to the German capital was caused as much by the greater opportunities for publishing there as by his \"Germanic\" tendencies. Indeed, the increasing virulence of antisemitism in Germany meant that later on he had difficulty placing pieces which were felt to be too pro-Jewish—which was often another way of saying \"not sufficiently anti-Jewish\".\n\nMore and more under Jew-hatred attacks, Franzos suffering from heart trouble died at the age of 55 in Berlin, where he is buried in the Weißensee Cemetery.\n\nFranzos showed the attitudes of the 19th-century assimilated Jew in their best light. His conviction that Germanisation was the way forward was based on the idealistic strain in German culture and will have looked very different in his day to a post-Holocaust perspective. He believed, following the example of Friedrich Schiller, that literature should have an ethical purpose, but he managed to express that purpose through a range of vivid characters who still have the power to move the modern reader.\n\nGalicia and Bukovina were the most backward, the poorest provinces of the Austrian Empire, so that Franzos saw his promotion of Germanisation as part of an attempt to improve conditions there politically and economically as well as culturally and socially. Jews made up some 12% of the population, the largest proportion of any province; two-thirds of the Empire's Jews lived in Galicia. Besides being mostly poor, the shtetl Jews were strict, conservative Hasidim, shutting themselves off as far as possible from their Christian neighbours, who responded in kind. Poor orthodox Jews from the east were a not uncommon sight in Vienna and were probably regarded with even greater hostility by many of the westernised Jews of the city than by the Christian population.\n\nThe rigidity with which the eastern Jewish communities shut themselves off from outside influences is the theme of Franzos's most ambitious work, \"Der Pojaz\", completed in 1893, but not published until after his death in 1905. Why this novel, which Franzos regarded as his major work, remained unpublished during his lifetime, is a mystery. It is possible that he thought his critical portrayal of the ghetto might be exploited by antisemitic elements which were becoming increasingly active in Germany in the 1890s. The relations between the Christian and Jewish communities come into sharpest focus in sexual matters—as a young man Franzos fell in love with a Christian girl but renounced her because of the barrier between the two groups. This problem forms the subject of a number of his works, including two of his best novels, \"Judith Trachtenberg\" (1890) and \"Leib Weihnachtskuchen and his Child\" (1896).\n\nThe main focus of his writing is the relationships between the different nationalities of the region—Poles, Ukrainians, Russians, Germans and Jews—and his sympathies clearly lie with the oppressed groups, in particular the Ukrainian peasants and shtetl Jews. He insisted that he was free from racial prejudice and that his attacks on particular nationalities were because they oppressed others:\n\n“I spoke out against the oppression of the Ukrainians and Poles by the Russians, but where the Poles do the same, as is the case in Galicia, then I speak out against their oppression of the Ukrainians, Jews and Germans.”\n\nHe also “spoke out” against the rigid attitudes and practices of orthodox religion, and in this his attacks were directed above all at his fellow Jews:\n\n“I stand up for the Jews because they are enslaved, but I attack the slavery the orthodox Jews impose on the liberal members of their faith.”\n\nHis works include:\n\nFranzos is also well known for being the first to publish an edition of Georg Büchner's work, which was vital for the rediscovery of the \"Vormärz\" author. Franzos completed his edition in 1879, including plays like \"Danton's Death\" and \"Leonce and Lena\". The manuscript of Büchner's drama \"Woyzeck\" was difficult to decipher, and had to be treated with chemicals in order to bring the ink up to the surface of the paper, and many of the pages were kept and later destroyed by Büchner's widow, who survived him by four decades. But Franzos's edition was for many years the authoritative version, until the late 1910s when a revival of Büchner's works began in Europe and the many errors in Franzos' edition came to light. These errors include the misspelling of the title, as \"Wozzeck\" instead of \"Woyzeck\", an alternate ending that involves Wozzeck drowning in lieu of Büchner's incomplete manuscript, and a fragmented plot without connections between the scenes. Although the play is often performed in newer versions, Franzos' edition has been immortalized in the form of Alban Berg's opera \"Wozzeck\", which uses the Franzos edition as its base.\n\n"}

This phenomenon is named after the American physicist P. W. Anderson, who was the first to suggest that electron localization is possible in a lattice potential, provided that the degree of randomness (disorder) in the lattice is sufficiently large, as can be realized for example in a semiconductor with impurities or defects.\n\nAnderson localization is a general wave phenomenon that applies to the transport of electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves, quantum waves, spin waves, etc. This phenomenon is to be distinguished from weak localization, which is the precursor effect of Anderson localization (see below), and from Mott localization, named after Sir Nevill Mott, where the transition from metallic to insulating behaviour is \"not\" due to disorder, but to a strong mutual Coulomb repulsion of electrons.\n\nIn the original Anderson tight-binding model, the evolution of the wave function \"ψ\" on the \"d\"-dimensional lattice Z is given by the Schrödinger equation\n\nwhere the Hamiltonian \"H\" is given by\n\nwith \"E\" random and independent, and potential \"V\"(\"r\") falling off as \"r\" at infinity. For example, one may take \"E\" uniformly distributed in [−\"W\",   +\"W\"], and\n\nStarting with \"ψ\" localised at the origin, one is interested in how fast the probability distribution formula_4 diffuses. Anderson's analysis shows the following:\n\n\n\nThe phenomenon of Anderson localization, particularly that of weak localization, finds its origin in the wave interference between multiple-scattering paths. In the strong scattering limit, the severe interferences can completely halt the waves inside the disordered medium.\n\nFor non-interacting electrons, a highly successful approach was put forward in 1979 by Abrahams \"et al.\" This scaling hypothesis of localization suggests that a disorder-induced metal-insulator transition (MIT) exists for non-interacting electrons in three dimensions (3D) at zero magnetic field and in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Much further work has subsequently supported these scaling arguments both analytically and numerically (Brandes \"et al.\", 2003; see Further Reading). In 1D and 2D, the same hypothesis shows that there are no extended states and thus no MIT. However, since 2 is the lower critical dimension of the localization problem, the 2D case is in a sense close to 3D: states are only marginally localized for weak disorder and a small spin-orbit coupling can lead to the existence of extended states and thus an MIT. Consequently, the localization lengths of a 2D system with potential-disorder can be quite large so that in numerical approaches one can always find a localization-delocalization transition when either decreasing system size for fixed disorder or increasing disorder for fixed system size. \nMost numerical approaches to the localization problem use the standard tight-binding Anderson Hamiltonian with onsite-potential disorder. Characteristics of the electronic eigenstates are then investigated by studies of participation numbers obtained by exact diagonalization, multifractal properties, level statistics and many others. Especially fruitful is the transfer-matrix method (TMM) which allows a direct computation of the localization lengths and further validates the scaling hypothesis by a numerical proof of the existence of a one-parameter scaling function. Direct numerical solution of Maxwell equations to demonstrate Anderson localization of light has been implemented (Conti and Fratalocchi, 2008).\nRecent work has shown that a non-interacting Anderson localized system can become many-body localized even in the presence of weak interactions. This result has been rigorously proven in 1D, while perturbative arguments exist even for two and three dimensions. \n\nTwo reports of Anderson localization of light in 3D random media exist up to date (Wiersma \"et al.\", 1997 and Storzer \"et al.\", 2006; see Further Reading), even though absorption complicates interpretation of experimental results (Scheffold \"et al.\", 1999). Anderson localization can also be observed in a perturbed periodic potential where the transverse localization of light is caused by random fluctuations on a photonic lattice. Experimental realizations of transverse localization were reported for a 2D lattice (Schwartz \"et al.\", 2007) and a 1D lattice (Lahini \"et al.\", 2006). Transverse Anderson localization of light has also been demonstrated in an optical fiber medium (Karbasi \"et al.\", 2012) and a biological medium (Choi \"et al.\", 2018), and has also been used to transport images through the fiber (Karbasi \"et al.\", 2014). It has also been observed by localization of a Bose–Einstein condensate in a 1D disordered optical potential (Billy \"et al.\", 2008; Roati \"et al.\", 2008). Anderson localization of elastic waves in a 3D disordered medium has been reported (Hu \"et al.\", 2008). The observation of the MIT has been reported in a 3D model with atomic matter waves (Chabé \"et al.\", 2008). The MIT, associated with the nonpropagative electron waves has been reported in a cm sized crystal (Ying \"et al.\", 2016) Random lasers can operate using this phenomenon.\n\nStandard diffusion has no localization property, being in disagreement with quantum predictions. However, it turns out that it is based on approximation of the principle of maximum entropy, which says that the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest entropy. This approximation is repaired in Maximal Entropy Random Walk, also repairing the disagreement: it turns out to lead to exactly the quantum ground state stationary probability distribution with its strong localization properties.\n\n\n"}

Modernized in the early 1990s, \"Melville's\" hull was lengthened, increasing her displacement to 2670 tons (full-load), and a new propulsion system was installed.\n\nThe \"Melville\" was used in the 1976 movie \"King Kong\", starring Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges. It was used specifically because of its Hypoid propulsion drive (at that time), which allowed it to move sideways. This type of drive is used, on research vessels, for station keeping in the ocean over drill and coring sites.\n\nThe White House confirmed on 17 November 2015 that the \"Melville\" and USCGC \"Boutwell\" (WHEC-719) would be transferred to the Philippine Navy as Excess Defense Articles (EDA)s.

It was their first after the departure of signature guitarist Stuart Adamson, who went on to found Big Country. As such, it represented a change of direction from rock towards folk music, amplifying the traditional Scottish element already hinted at in previous releases. This would be their last album until the release of \"Burning Cities\", over 36 years later.\n\nThe band line-up included Richard Jobson and Russell Webb along with J. J. Johnson (drums and percussion), Paul Wishart (saxophone, flute, keyboards, percussion and vocals) and a collection of musical friends. The band rehearsed at Britannia Row Studios in London.\n\nSessions in July 1981 led to the release of the first single from the upcoming album. \"Fields\" was released in August, with Kenny Hyslop on drums. The song also featured Billy MacKenzie (vocals) and Alan Rankine (guitar), core members of The Associates. Guesting, early in her career, was Virginia Astley (flute). The strummed guitar and marching band elements (bagpipe emulation and percussion) signalled a change in direction, though the rabble-rousing melody and football pitch vocal delivery were standard Skids fare.\n\nSessions continued through September 1981 and produced a second single, \"Iona\" (named for the Scottish island). It was the only song on the album to be recorded at Highland Studios in Inverness, Scotland. Released in October 1981 this was the last Skids track to feature Stuart Adamson, alongside Mike Oldfield. At 3:24 the single edit is significantly shorter than the version on the album.\n\nIt marks a concerted effort to update traditional Scottish music into the age of modern rock recordings. The sound is fundamentally more pastoral than previous Skids efforts. Gone are the layers of harmonically treated electric guitar. However, elements of this style were hinted at previously, particularly on the \"Strength Through Joy\" mini-album. The lyrical concerns of strife, war and brotherhood are Jobson staples.\n\nWith Paul Wishart on saxophone, \"And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda\" is a cover version of the song by Eric Bogle.\n\n\"Joy\" was released in November 1981. Although the band recorded a BBC Radio 1 session and shot a music video for \"Iona\", promotion problems at Virgin forestalled a tour. With patchy coverage, no live support and a difficult change in musical direction, the record sank without a trace. Critical reception was mixed at best, and the band split up the following year.\n\nThe album bore fruit in several working relationships. Virginia Astley would go on to record her debut solo releases with Russell Webb, and guests on Jobson's poetry album \"The Ballad of Etiquette\".\n\nFollowing the disbandment of Skids the remaining members Richard Jobson and Russell Webb formed The Armoury Show with Magazine's John McGeoch and John Doyle.\n\nThis album remained unreleased on CD until 2016, but was released in MP3 format on 7 December 2009, including several alternate single mixes as bonus tracks.

It may also be contrasted with Submission. Surrender is willful acceptance and yielding to a dominating force and their will.\n\nIn Christianity, the first main principle of surrender is \"Dying to Self\", or \"The Carrying of Your Cross\" allowing Christ to reign and rule in the order of how one's life is carried out, illustrated in the following passages: \n\nAnother principle central to the Christian concept of surrender is the concept of surrender to God's Will. Surrendering to God's will entails both the surrender of our will to His, in His sovereignty over all things, in which His ways of operating and thinking prevails over humanity's and Satan's. Secondarily, the surrender of one's will is evidenced by the acknowledgement of God's will for our personal lives in even the smallest decisions. This is done through putting personal desire aside in favor of God's perfect will for our lives. This includes the reality of an acceptance to a calling or purpose. The precipice or essentiality of this personal surrender is obedience, and obedience to God is an indication of bringing about His will. Which, having lasting effects through generations, and in kingdoms/nations, is often associated with earthly and heavenly blessings.\n\nThe ultimate surrender; the surrender of Christ, which is a fully submitted will to God's Divine plan, is seen in Christ's birth as well as His final three prayers, in Gethsemane, before His crucifixion. The coming into the world as God incarnate and then the surrender to the Cross/His life in the act of sacrificial atonement, breaking the curse of sin and death from the Fall.\n\nThis is evidenced in the following:\n\nSurrender is also noted in Christian doctrine as one of the three columns of victorious living, or Christian victory: the Blood of the Lamb [Christ], their Testimony of the Word of God [Scriptures] and their lives, and Loving not their own lives to death; that Christ's life may be shown.\n\nThe Christian Flag, which represents all of Christendom, has a white field, with a red Latin cross inside a blue canton. In conventional vexillology, a white flag is linked to surrender, a reference to the Biblical description Jesus' non-violence and surrender to God's will.\n\nAccording to the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna said the following to the warrior Arjuna, who became his disciple:\n\nSeveral gurus teach their disciples the importance of surrender to God or to themselves, as part of the guru-disciple relationship. For example, the \"Sri Sai Satcharita\", the biography of Sai Baba of Shirdi says that surrender to the guru is the only \"sadhana\".\n\nPrem Rawat, formerly called Guru Maharaj Ji, was quoted in 1978 \"But there is nothing to understand! And if there is something to understand, there is only one thing to understand, and that is to surrender!\"\n\nContrary to the notion of surrendering onto God, Krishna in Bhagavad Gita also advises his followers to question everything in pursuit of absolute truth.\n\nThe concept of surrender is when a person abides by the five main Pillars of Islam. following the faith means surrendering or submitting one's will to God. This means that Muslims in their daily life should strive for excellence under the banner of God's will. Every single action in a Muslim's life, whether marriage or building one's career, should theoretically be for the sake of God.\n\n"}

{"id": "2214041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214041", "title": "Sector mass spectrometer", "text": "Sector mass spectrometer\n\nA sector instrument is a general term for a class of mass spectrometer that uses a static electric or magnetic sector or some combination of the two (separately in space) as a mass analyzer. A popular combination of these sectors has been the BEB (magnetic-electric-magnetic). Most modern sector instruments are double-focusing instruments (first developed by A. Dempster, K. Bainbridge and J. Mattauch in 1936) in that they focus the ion beams both in direction and velocity.\n\nThe behavior of ions in a homogeneous, linear, static electric or magnetic field (separately) as is found in a sector instrument is simple. The physics are described by a single equation called the Lorentz force law. This equation is the fundamental equation of all mass spectrometric techniques and applies in non-linear, non-homogeneous cases too and is an important equation in the field of electrodynamics in general.\n\nwhere E is the electric field strength, B is the magnetic field induction, \"q\" is the charge of the particle, v is its current velocity (expressed as a vector), and × is the cross product.\n\nSo the force on an ion in a linear homogenous electric field (an electric sector) is:\n\nin the direction of the electric field, with positive ions and opposite that with negative ions.\n\nThe force is only dependent on the charge and electric field strength. The lighter ions will be deflected more and heavier ions less due to the difference in inertia and the ions will physically separate from each other in space into distinct beams of ions as they exit the electric sector.\n\nAnd the force on an ion in a linear homogenous magnetic field (a magnetic sector) is:\n\nperpendicular to both the magnetic field and the velocity vector of the ion itself, in the direction determined by the right-hand rule of cross products and the sign of the charge.\n\nThe force in the magnetic sector is complicated by the velocity dependence but with the right conditions (uniform velocity for example) ions of different masses will separate physically in space into different beams as with the electric sector.\n\nThese are some of the classic geometries from mass spectrographs which are often used to distinguish different types of sector arrangements, although most current instruments do not fit precisely into any of these categories as the designs have evolved further.\n\nThe sector instrument geometry consists of a 127.30° formula_4 electric sector without an initial drift length followed by a 60° magnetic sector with the same direction of curvature. Sometimes called a \"Bainbridge mass spectrometer,\" this configuration is often used to determine isotopic masses. A beam of positive particles is produced from the isotope under study. The beam is subject to the combined action of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields. Since the forces due to these two fields are equal and opposite when the particles have a velocity given by\n\nthey do not experience a resultant force; they pass freely through a slit, and are then subject to another magnetic field, transversing a semi-circular path and striking a photographic plate. The mass of the isotope is determined through subsequent calculation.\n\nThe Mattauch-Herzog geometry consists of a 31.82° (formula_6 radians) electric sector, a drift length which is followed by a 90° magnetic sector of opposite curvature direction. The entry of the ions sorted primarily by charge into the magnetic field produces an energy focussing effect and much higher transmission than a standard energy filter. This geometry is often used in applications with a high energy spread in the ions produced where sensitivity is nonetheless required, such as spark source mass spectrometry (SSMS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).\nThe advantage of this geometry over the Nier-Johnson geometry is that the ions of different masses are all focused onto the same flat plane. This allows the use of a photographic plate or other flat detector array.\n\nThe Nier-Johnson geometry consists of a 90° electric sector, a long intermediate drift length and a 60° magnetic sector of the same curvature direction.\n\nThe Hinterberger-Konig geometry consists of a 42.43° electric sector, a long intermediate drift length and a 130° magnetic sector of the same curvature direction.\n\nThe Takeshita geometry consists of a 54.43° electric sector, and short drift length, a second electric sector of the same curvature direction followed by another drift length before a 180° magnetic sector of opposite curvature direction.\n\nThe Matsuda geometry consists of an 85° electric sector, a quadrupole lens and a 72.5° magnetic sector of the same curvature direction. This geometry is used in the SHRIMP and Panorama (gas source, high resolution, multicollector to measure isotopologues in geochemistry).\n\n"}

The centre, one of the main venues of the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Paralympics, was used for the swimming, diving and synchronised swimming events. After significant modification, the centre opened to the public in March 2014.\n\nThe centre was designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Zaha Hadid in 2004 before London won the bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. It was built alongside the Water Polo Arena and opposite the Olympic Stadium on the opposite bank of the Waterworks River. The site is high, long, and wide. The wave-like roof is stated to be , a reduction from the previously stated . The design was inspired by the Dollan Aqua Centre in East Kilbride, Scotland.\n\nThe complex has a 50-m competition pool, a 25-m competition diving pool and a 50-m warm-up pool. The 50-m pool is 3 metres deep, like the one in the Beijing National Aquatics Center, in order to be fast. Its floor can be moved to reduce its depth. There are also moveable booms that allow its size to be changed. The diving pool has platform boards at heights of 3 m, 5 m, 7.5 m, and 10 m and three 3m springboards. For the television coverage of the Olympics, the pools were also equipped with innovative cameras in order to present the action from multiple angles.\n\nBecause the centre was designed before the Olympic bid was completed, the spectator wings were not part of the original design. They were later added to fit the estimated audience.\n\nJacques Rogge, IOC President, described the Centre as a \"masterpiece\".\n\nOn 1 December 2005, Hadid was instructed to revise her designs after a specification change led to a doubling of the £75-million estimated cost. The new plans were unveiled on 27 November 2006. Although the same general design was kept, with capacity for 17,500 spectators, the revised design was much smaller and was expected to cost much less than the previous estimate. However, subsequent cost increases were reported to Parliament in 2008.\n\nThe construction contract was awarded to Balfour Beatty in April 2008. At the same time, it was reported that the centre would cost about three times as much as originally estimated, totalling about £242 million. The cost increases were attributed to construction inflation and VAT increases, and also included the estimated cost of converting the facility for public use after the Olympic and Paralympic Games. \nThe Centre was completed in July 2011 at a final cost of £269 million.\n\nBy exposing the concrete finish rather than painting or cladding, the design demonstrates the precast-concrete skills provided by Peri. The precast floor terracing was manufactured by Bell & Webster Concrete in Lincolnshire, England. The terracing units were delivered and positioned to accelerate the speed of construction. The unique six-board diving platform is made from 462 tonnes of concrete. The aluminium roof covering was provided by Kalzip. The steel structure was built in cooperation with Rowecord Engineering, of Newport, Wales. The ceiling was built with 30,000 sections of Red Louro timber. The steel roof weighs 3,200 tonnes. The three pools hold around 10 million litres (2.2 million imperial gallons; 2.6 million US gallons) of water.\n\nAfter the Paralympic Games, the Aquatic Centre was deconstructed to reduce its space. The frame wings on either side of the central space were removed, unbolted, and sold. The PVC wrap that temporarily enclosed the space was also sold, while the seats and toilets were reused elsewhere. As certain parts of the building were no longer needed, they were recycled via Vinyloop. This allowed the standards of the Olympic Delivery Authority concerning environmental protection to be met.\n\nDuring the Games the venue had a capacity of 17,500. The two temporary \"wings\" have been removed, reducing the capacity to a regular 2,800 with an additional 1,000 seats available for major events. Of all the swimming venues built for the 2012 Summer Olympics, the Aquatics Centre is the only one that will remain afterwards, albeit in a downsized form.\n\nSince the Olympic Games the venue has been modified, especially by removing the temporary seating that flanked the centre during the Games. It opened to the public on 1 March 2014. Admission prices are in line with local leisure centres.\n\nThe adjacent Water Polo Arena was dismantled after the Olympic Games, which left the Aquatics Centre as the sole swimming venue at the park. The centre hosted the 2014 FINA/NVC Diving World Series and the 2016 European Aquatics Championships.\n\n"}
{"id": "2214044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214044", "title": "Minto, New Brunswick", "text": "Minto, New Brunswick\n\nMinto (2016 pop. 2,305) is a Canadian village straddling the border of Sunbury County and Queens County, New Brunswick. It is located on the north shore of Grand Lake, approximately 50 kilometres northeast of Fredericton. Its population meets the requirements for \"town\" status under the Municipalities Act of the Province of New Brunswick, but the community has not made any change in municipal status.\n\nMinto was originally named Northfield but it is known to have taken its present name in 1904 upon the retirement of Canada's eighth Governor General, The Earl of Minto. However, the village was known as Minto since 1902, and the story remains that the village adopted its name from the local Minto Hotel. From the \"St. John Daily Sun\" of 1903: \"Just how the name of Minto came to be adopted is said to have occurred in this way. A letter which was sent from Moncton to Mr. Kennedy was enclosed in an envelope which bore the name of the Minto hotel, Moncton. The family thought Minto a good name for their hotel, and so it was named. Then the people generally adopted the name for the place, and so the railway people designated it.\"\n\nMinto did not feel the depression, or at least did not feel it in the same way as most other places in Canada; during recession and the Great Depression, Minto was profiting from a coal mining boom. The coal brought a level of financial prosperity to the community in the early 1900s, which by the late 1930s turned into a profitable venture for companies, and brought starvation and disease to a then impoverished community. As stated in the \"United Mine Workers' Journal\" of 1937, \"Nowhere on the American continent, is there a strife which combines the elements of greed, harshness, cold, suffering, and want, as exists [in Minto].\"\n\nEarly in Minto's coal mining exploits, land owners were permitted to mine under their own land without obtaining a license from the Crown or paying any royalties, which ended in 1915. During the boom, both mining conditions and the living quarters of miners' families degraded with lowering wages and lack of maintenance in the mines and homes supplied to the miners families. Although a tally of the number of deaths related to the coal mining industry in Minto is not available, deaths did occur.\n\nThe need of transporting coal brought the railway to Minto, and was to make the area \"the most prosperous place in Canada.\" The New Brunswick Central Railway ended at Chipman (about north-east of Minto) and in 1901 the railway was planned to be completed by constructing through the village to Fredericton, and connect with the Canadian Pacific railway. By 1904 the railway was completed as far as Minto, merging with the existing Central, however by 1905 completion to Fredericton was abandoned and the remaining railway was not built until 1913.\n\nAlthough the railway lines through Minto have since been completely removed, the railway station continues on as a local museum. By the end of 2010, coal mining in Minto ended when the last coal mining company, NB Coal, closed.\n\nDuring the early years of the Great Depression, the New Brunswick Power Corporation built the province's first thermal generating station south of the village on the shores of Grand Lake. Opened in 1931, the Grand Lake Generating Station accessed coal from nearby deposits. An NB Power subsidiary, NB Coal, was the only mining company left in the Minto area and performed strip mining. NB Power closed the Grand Lake Station when its operating license expired in June 2010. As the Station has been NB Coal’s only customer since 2000, NB Coal closed in December 2009. On April 19, 2012 the Grand Lake Generating Station was demolished, and by this time all coal mining in Minto had ended.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the largest internment camp in eastern Canada was located in the hamlet of Ripples, 10 km west of the village of Minto. Originally it was home to German and Austrian Jews who had fled the Nazis to England.\nSome youths later became notable, including theologian Gregory Baum, chemist Ernest Eliel and physicist Walter Kohn. Later after these Jewish refugees had been released into Canadian life, it became a camp mostly for German prisoners of war, as well as some sympathizers such as Canadian fascist Adrien Arcand. Its most notable prisoner at this time was the anti-conscriptionist mayor of Montreal, Camillien Houde.\n\nThis internment camp is now a protected site visited by tourists. The only structure remaining at the site is the base of a water-tower where a plaque stands, visible from the highway. A walking trail leads into the forest where a few ruins of the camp and posted signs describing the area may be found. There is a small museum dedicated to the camp located within Minto's municipal building.\n\nThough Minto is a very small community, there are recreational activities that take place year-round. It has the Minto Centennial Arena, lighted and unlighted ball parks, two family parks, nature trails, mountain bike trails, and hunting and fishing resources.\n\nEach year there are two festivals in Minto. In summer the Minto Fun Days (also known as the Minto Coal Mining Festival) is celebrated in June–July, first run in 1972. The Santa Claus Parade and Tree Lighting Ceremony is celebrated in November–December, with the first annual parade held in 2010.\n\nOnce a year mountain bike racers descend on the town of Minto for a race known as 'The Coal Miner's Lung'. The endurance race covers 20km, 40km or 60km of Minto single track. \n\nThere are two schools in Minto: Minto Elementary and Middle School, and Minto Memorial High School. Both schools offer extracurricular activities including sports clubs, destination conservation, peer helpers and student government. While Minto Elementary and Middle School is a newer building, Minto High has been added to with a new gym and shop. In 2011 the New Brunswick Community College (NBCC) Fredericton campus established a satellite campus the Minto Regional Delivery Site.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Morell (1918-2004), author of \"Of Mines and Men\"; 1995 recipient of United Nations Community Service Award\n\n\n"}

Coors launched the massive ad campaign using Nevins' track as the featured music for their commercial and campaign. In 2007, Nevins collaborated with Dannii Minogue on \"Touch Me Like That\", with a video being shot at the legendary Pinewood Studios in London.\n\nOver the years, Nevins has had numerous songs, productions and remixes of his used in films, television advertisements and video games. Jason has had 37 top 10 remixes and productions in the \"Billboard\" charts. In 2012, Nevins produced and co-wrote \"I Believe in This Life\" with Marius Moga (who has a song with Maroon 5) and Greg Holden (who wrote the hit song \"Home\" for Phillip Phillips)—a U.S. single for Jermaine Paul, the winner of the second season of the massively popular TV show \"The Voice\" on NBC. The song was used in a commercial for the Samsung Galaxy and their \"Next Big Thing\" campaign also featuring Blake Shelton.\n\nIn 2013 Nevins produced the top 40 version for the American country group Florida Georgia Line's hit single \"Cruise\" featuring American singer/rapper Nelly. His idea of adding Nelly to the record also helped propel it to the top of the charts. The song peaked at number 2 on iTunes and at number 4 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and has amassed over 2.5 million in sales.\n\nIn 2013, Nevins, along with Florida Georgia Line and Nelly won the award for Song of the Year at the American Musics Award for the remix of \"Cruise\".\n\nIn 2013, Nevins produced the main version of Ariana Grande and Mika's \"Popular Song\", which was certified Gold in the US by the RIAA (500,0000 copies). Nevins was hired by Rich Issacson, Mika's manager and Republic Records. The official YouTube video has reached 185 million views.\n\nIn 2014, Nevins, along with Florida Georgia Line and Nelly were nominated for Vocal Event of the Year at the 2014 Academy of Country Music Awards.\n\nOn November 10, 2016, Nevins' remix of Nelly's \"Work It\" was played at the Golden State Warriors basketball game and became part of the viral video clip of Robin Schreiber dancing in the stands. The mega-viral video has achieved 130 million views.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is the recipient of several accolades, including two Academy Awards and a Golden Globe Award. \"Time\" magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2019.\n\nAfter pursuing an MFA degree from New York University, Ali began his career as a regular on television series, such as \"Crossing Jordan\" (2001–2002) and \"Threat Matrix\" (2003–2004), before his breakthrough role as Richard Tyler in the science fiction series \"The 4400\" (2004–2007). His first major film release was in the David Fincher-directed fantasy \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" (2008). He gained wider attention for his supporting role in the Netflix political thriller series \"House of Cards\" (2013–2016), as Boggs in the final two films of \"The Hunger Games\" film series, and as Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes in the \"Luke Cage\" series.\n\nAli won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performances as Juan in the drama film \"Moonlight\" (2016) and for his portrayal of Don Shirley in the comedy-drama film \"Green Book\" (2018). This made him the first black actor to win two Academy Awards in the same category. In 2019, he played the lead role of a troubled police officer in the third season of the HBO anthology crime series \"True Detective\". In 2020, he starred in the second season of the Hulu comedy-drama series \"Ramy\".\n\nAli was born Mahershalalhashbaz Gilmore in 1974, in Hayward, California, the son of Phillip Gilmore (1956–1994) and Willicia Goines (born 1957). He was raised a Christian in Hayward, California by his mother, an ordained Baptist minister. His father was an actor who appeared on Broadway. Maher-shalal-hash-baz is the name of a prophetic child in chapter 8 of the Biblical Book of Isaiah.\n\nHe attended St. Mary's College of California (SMC) in Moraga, California, where he graduated in 1996 with a degree in mass communication. He entered SMC with a basketball scholarship and went by the name \"Hershal Gilmore\" when playing for the SMC Gaels. He became disenchanted with the idea of a sports career because of the treatment given to the team's athletes, and developed an interest in acting, particularly after taking part in a staging of \"Spunk\". This later landed him an apprenticeship at the California Shakespeare Theater following graduation. After a sabbatical year working for \"Gavin Report\", he enrolled in New York University's graduate acting program at Tisch School of the Arts, earning his master's degree in 2000.\n\nIn 2000, he converted to Islam, changed his surname from Gilmore to Ali, and joined the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. In interviews, he has recounted numerous problems he has encountered at airports, with banks and otherwise in everyday life as an American Muslim since the September 11 attacks.\n\nAli was known professionally by his full name, Mahershalalhashbaz Ali, from 2001 until 2010, when he began to be credited as Mahershala Ali. Ali had considered shortening his name for a while, saying that using his full first name was \"a crazy thing to do considering that we're in Hollywood\", although he had never been pressured by managers or agents to change it. He decided to use a shorter version of his first name after being told that his full name was too long to fit on the poster for the film \"The Place Beyond the Pines\". He did not want the alternative of \"M. Ali\" to represent himself on the poster, so he chose to adopt the shorter version of his name.\n\nHe elaborated in an interview to \"Vanity Fair\" in October 2016: \n\nHe is known for his portrayal of Remy Danton in the Netflix series \"House of Cards\", Cornell Stokes in \"Marvel's Luke Cage\", Colonel Boggs in \"\" and \"\", and Tizzy in the 2008 film \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\".\n\nHis first major film role was that of Tizzy Weathers in the 2008 David Fincher-directed romantic fantasy drama film \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\". Other notable films include \"Predators\", \"The Place Beyond the Pines\", \"Free State of Jones\", \"Hidden Figures\", and as Boggs in \"The Hunger Games series\".\n\nFor his performance as mentor and drug dealer Juan in the drama film \"Moonlight\" (2016), Ali received universal acclaim from critics and won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, the SAG Award and the Critics' Choice Award for Best Supporting Actor, and received a Golden Globe and a BAFTA Award nomination. His win at the 89th Academy Awards made him the first Muslim actor to win an Oscar.\n\nIn 2017 Ali joined the video game \"Madden NFL 18\" story mode \"Longshot\", in which he played Cutter Wade, the father of protagonist Devin. He played Don Shirley in the 2018 film \"Green Book\", receiving his second Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He won Golden Globe award in 2019 for best supporting actor for his role, as well as a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.\n\nAli starred as Arkansas State Police detective Wayne Hays in the third season of the HBO series \"True Detective\", which premiered on January 13, 2019, in the United States. On Rotten Tomatoes, the site's critical consensus reads, \"Driven by Mahershala Ali's mesmerizing performance, \"True Detective\"s third season finds fresh perspective by exploring real world events – though it loses some of the series' intriguing strangeness along the way.\"\nAt the annual San Diego Comic-Con in July 2019, Ali was announced as being cast to play the supernatural superhero Blade in a future Marvel Cinematic Universe adaptation of the character, which was previously played by Wesley Snipes.\n\nAli was signed to Bay Area recording label Hieroglyphics Imperium during the late 2000s and recorded rap music as Prince Ali. He released his album, \"Curb Side Service\", in 2007, but did not tour to promote the album, choosing instead to focus on his acting career.\n\nAli is an Ahmadi Muslim. He named his cat Nas, after the rapper. He is married to Amatus Sami-Karim, an actress and musician. Their first child, a daughter, was born in February 2017.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2214065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214065", "title": "Je ne sais pas pourquoi", "text": "Je ne sais pas pourquoi\n\n\"Je ne sais pas pourquoi\" (), also known as \"I Still Love You (Je ne sais pas pourquoi)\" in Australia and New Zealand, is a song by Australian recording artist and songwriter Kylie Minogue from her debut studio album \"Kylie\" (1988). Released as a single on 10 October 1988 by PWL, the song has subsequently appeared on most of Minogue's hits compilations including \"Greatest Hits\" (1992), \"Ultimate Kylie\" (2004) and, most recently, \"\", released in 2019. Like most of Minogue's material between 1988 and 1992, it was written and produced by Stock Aitken Waterman.\n\nThe song, with its French inspired theme and accompanying video, was released as the fourth single in October 1988, and was taken from the debut studio album \"Kylie\". It was written and produced by Stock Aitken Waterman, who produced Minogue's first four studio albums. The title of the song varied in different parts of the world. In Australia, the US, Canada and New Zealand it was retitled \"I Still Love You\" followed by the original French title in brackets. In some parts of Europe, there was a further variation, \"Je ne sais pas pourquoi (I Still Love You)\" but although the 7\" single had different titles depending on the territory of release, the song itself is the same.\n\n\"Je ne sais pas pourquoi\" is a teen-pop ballad, which is also inspired by dance-pop, which features instrumentals including drum machine, synthesizers and some minor guitar riffs. A substantially different early demo version of \"Je ne sais pas pourquoi\" is known to exist, although it has never been officially released. This version is said to have a completely different intro and is of a slightly faster tempo and has a stronger beat.\n\nCommercially, the song received good chart success, peaking in the top ten in countries including Finland (where it peaked at number one), Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, while peaking in the top twenty in countries like Australia, France, Germany and Norway.\n\n\"Je ne sais pas pourquoi\" had been performed at Minogue's world tours such as Disco in Dream/The Hitman Roadshow, Enjoy Yourself Tour, Rhythm of Love Tour, Let's Get To It Tour, and the Summer 2019 Tour.\n\nThe video is meant to look like it is shot in Paris in the '40s or '50s as Minogue waits in the rain for her date to arrive and then heads to a café. Minogue's hair is set in waves and she is wearing a blue dress and matching angora cardigan. This is later intercut with a street scene that is filmed in black and white and depicts Minogue wearing a floral dress as she dances with a man. Minogue is the only colourful part of the scene.\n\n\"Made in Heaven\" was released as the single's B-side and also was written and produced by Stock, Aitken and Waterman. It was a new song which was not included on the album \"Kylie\" and an extended remix was also included on the 12\" single. A promotional video was produced for \"Made in Heaven\" which was first issued on the Stock Aitken Waterman hits compilation, \"The Hit Factory Volume 3\" and later on the \"Greatest Hits 1987-1997\" compilation.\n\nIn the UK territory, \"Je ne sais pas pourquoi\" was originally planned to be released as a double A-side with \"Made in Heaven\". The original plan was to heavily promote \"Je ne sais pas pourquoi\" during the singles' early chart run, and once the song had peaked, the single would be officially 'flipped' and promotional emphasis shifted to \"Made in Heaven\" which would become the listed A-side. This marketing tactic had been used similarly with Rick Astley's single \"When I Fall In Love\"/\"My Arms Keep Missing You\" with the latter song becoming the singles' 'official' A-side after Christmas 1987. However, after reaching number 2 for 3 consecutive weeks, \"Je ne sais pas pourquoi\", although included on the widely available \"Kylie\" album, performed so well on its own that the plans to release it as a double A-side single were changed.\n\nThe video to \"Made to Heaven\" solely involves Minogue dancing in front of a bluescreen with images of her previous five videos sampled behind her. She was surrounded by a halo of light and it was the last video before she began to routinely involve dancers and choreographed routines in her videos and performances. Kylie performed \"Made in Heaven\" at the \"Royal Variety Performance\" in front of the Queen Mother where she announced it as her new song - \"Made in Heaven\" was however never released as an A-side anywhere but it was used as the B-side to the international releases of both \"It's No Secret\" and \"Turn It into Love\". \"Je ne sais pas pourquoi\" was the 20th biggest selling single of 1988 in the UK.\n\n\"I Still Love You (Je ne sais pas pourquoi)\" debuted at number thirteen on the Australian Singles Chart and four weeks later, it rose to number 11. After this, it slowly fell off the charts. In New Zealand, it debuted at number thirty-eight on the New Zealand Singles Chart, until it peaked at number 9 the following week.\n\nThe song debuted at number 33 on the French Singles Chart, until peaking at number 15, and stayed in the chart for fifteen weeks. The song debuted at number 87 on the Dutch Top 40, and peaked at number 43. The song spent a sole week in Norway at number 10. In Switzerland, the song debuted at number 24, where it peaked, but stayed in the top twenty-five for four weeks, until completely dropping off the charts. In Germany, it peaked at number 14 and in Ireland, the song made number 2.\n\nThe song was most successful in the United Kingdom where it debuted at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart, until rising to number 2, staying there for three consecutive weeks (only behind Enya's \"Orinoco Flow\"), becoming Kylie's fourth consecutive Top 2 hit in less than a year. The song stayed in the charts for fourteen weeks and went on to sell 315,000 copies. In the United States, the song was released as \"I Still Love You (Je ne sais pas pourquoi)\", but did not reach the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThese are the formats and track listings of major single releases of \"Je ne sais pas pourquoi\".\n\nCD single<br>\n\n\n7-inch single<br>\n\n\n12-inch single<br>\n\n\nUK 12-inch remix<br>\n\n\nUS 12-inch single<br>\n\n\nMinogue performed the song on the following concert tours:\n"}

He is best known for his \"Pot-Shots\", single-panel illustrations with one-line humorous remarks, which began syndication in the United States of America in 1975. Brilliant became a naturalized American citizen in 1969.\n\nBrilliant attended Hendon School (then Hendon County School), London, in the 1940s–50s. He graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a PhD in history in 1964 and taught on a \"Floating University\", an educational cruise ship that traveled around the world in the mid-60s. He later taught at a community college in Bend, Oregon.\n\nDuring the \"Summer of Love\" in San Francisco in 1967, Brilliant gave daily lectures near the Haight Street entrance of Golden Gate Park. He released a live album recorded in Golden Gate Park in 1967 on a small Hollywood, California record label, Dorash Enterprises (Dorash LP-1001). The album, \"Ashleigh Brilliant in the Haight-Ashbury\", is quite rare today. The material uses familiar public domain songs and melodies and incorporates clever poetic lyrics about marijuana, the Diggers, San Francisco neighborhoods, and his personal experiences, all the while displaying a banter which ebbs and flows with his audience, who respond warmly to the performance and also participate in the songs. He states in the recording that he had been performing in this setting for approximately two hours each day the prior four weeks. He laughs throughout his performance, while the audience joins him in singing along and banging on percussive items. The album ends with a \"Haight-Ashbury Farewell\".\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\" described him in a 1992 profile as \"history's only full time, professional published epigrammatist.\"\n\nAt one time, there was some confusion and controversy as to the ownership and recognition of his distinctive art form. In a copyright infringement suit filed by Brilliant, a United States federal judge ruled that while short phrases are not eligible for copyright, Brilliant's works were epigrams and therefore copyrightable (\"Brilliant v. W.B. Productions Inc.\", 1979).\n\nWhile Brilliant employs a self-imposed limit of 17 words per epigram, he has actually written and published 41 with 18 words and one with 19 words.\n\nIn 1999 he authored the \"Y1K Crisis\" article which parodies the \"Y2K Crisis\" of 1999.\n\nPart of the counter-culture scene in San Francisco in the late 1960s, Brilliant wrote and sang a series of parody songs about the hippie movement in Golden Gate Park as the hippie movement happened. Called \"The Haight-Ashbury Songbook\", the songs now appear on a CD collection available on his website.\n\nBrilliant celebrated his 80th birthday in December 2013 in Franceschi Park in his current home town of Santa Barbara, California. There he was presented with a document signed by the mayor proclaiming him to be the \"Wise Old Man of the Mountain\".\n\nIn an essay entitled \"Against intellectual property\", Brian Martin cites Brilliant as a \"professional epigrammatist\" who has been known to threaten legal action in order to display his market precedence over legally owned fragments of human language, thus managing to reveal one of the many absurdities behind \"intellectual property\", namely its ability to limit the free use and dissemination of human expression. When Brilliant finds someone who has \"used\" one of his epigrams, he contacts them demanding a payment for breach of copyright.\n\nFor instance, television journalist David Brinkley wrote a book, \"Everyone is Entitled to My Opinion\", the title of which he attributed to a friend of his daughter. Brilliant contacted Brinkley about copyright violation and Random House, Brinkley's publisher, paid Brilliant $1000 without contesting the issue.\n\nIn a separate 1979 case, a company copied two of Brilliant's phrases – \"I may not be totally perfect, but parts of me are excellent\" and \"I have abandoned my search for truth and am now looking for a good fantasy\"—and altered a third phrase, all for sale on T-shirt transfers. The district court acknowledged that the phrases were distinguished by conciseness, cleverness, and pointed observation, ruling that they were protected by copyright. \n\nAs Brilliant himself insists that his \"phrases\" (or \"Pot-Shots\") are original epigrams, then it follows that any use of them without his permission, specifically for commercial reasons (or for financial gain, or profit), would be a breach of copyright. One similar to the use of any other \"poetic\" material (specifically, large portions of said work) without the author's consent.\n\nAll books published by Woodbridge Press (Santa Barbara, California)\n\n\n"}

Calhoun, Pickens was born into the culture of the antebellum plantocracy. He became an ardent supporter of nullification of federal tariffs when he served in the South Carolina House of Representatives before he was elected to Congress and then the state senate.\n\nAs state governor during the Fort Sumter crisis, he sanctioned the firing on the ship bringing supplies to the beleaguered Union garrison, and to the bombardment of the fort.\n\nAfter the war, it was Pickens who introduced the motion to repeal South Carolina's Ordinance of Secession, a short speech received in silence, in notable contrast with the rejoicing that had first greeted the Ordinance.\n\nPickens was born in Togadoo, St Paul's Parish, in Colleton County, South Carolina. His exact birth date varies depending on the source. Some give April 7, 1805; others give April 7, 1807. Pickens's gravestone uses the 1807 date. He was the son of former Gov. Andrew Pickens and a grandson of Gen. Andrew Pickens, an American Revolutionary soldier at the Battle of Cowpens and former U.S. Congressman. His mother was Susannah Smith Wilkinson. A cousin of his grandmother was South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun. He was also a cousin of Floride Calhoun, Calhoun's wife and a niece of his grandfather. His son-in-law was Confederate General and U.S. Senator Matthew C. Butler, a son of congressman William Butler (1790-1850); grandson of congressman William Butler and a nephew of Senator Andrew Butler.\n\nPickens was wealthy. According to the 1860 census, he owned $45,400 in real estate (the equivalent of approximately $1,247,000 today) and $244,206 in personal property (about $6,768,000 today). He also owned 276 slaves.\n\nPickens was educated at Franklin College (now a part of the University of Georgia) in Athens, Georgia, and at South Carolina College in Columbia. He was admitted to the bar in 1829, the same year that he constructed \"Edgewood,\" a mansion in Edgefield. He joined the Democratic Party and served in the South Carolina house of representatives from 1832–34, where he was an ardent supporter of nullification. As chairman of a sub-committee, he submitted a report denying the right of Congress to exercise any control over the states.\n\nPickens served in Congress as a representative from South Carolina from 1834 until 1843. He was a member of the South Carolina state senate from 1844 until 1846. He was offered the position of Minister to England by President James K. Polk, and the Minister to France by President John Tyler, but declined these diplomatic posts. He served as a delegate to the Nashville Convention in 1850. Twice a widower, he married Lucy Petway Holcombe (1832–1899) on April 26, 1856, and in 1859 she gave birth to Douschka Pickens. Under President James Buchanan, Pickens was Minister to Russia from 1858–1860, where he and his wife were befriended by Czar Alexander II.\n\nUnder his administration as Governor of South Carolina (1860–1862), the state seceded and demanded the surrender of the Federal forts in Charleston harbor. He strongly advocated the secession of the Southern states but he did not sign the South Carolina ordinance of secession, as is commonly reported. He protested against Major Robert Anderson's removal from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter, and offered to acquire the fort from the United States as part of an equitable settlement of the assets and debts of what Pickens considered to be now-dissolved federal union.\n\nOn January 9, 1861, Governor Pickens sanctioned the firing upon the relief steamship \"Star of the West,\" which was bringing supplies to Anderson's beleaguered garrison. In a letter dated January 12, 1861, Pickens demanded of President Buchanan that he surrender Fort Sumter because, \"I regard that possession is not consistent with the dignity or safety of the State of South Carolina.\"\n\nHe also approved of the subsequent bombardment of Fort Sumter. He remained a fervent supporter of states rights.\n\nPickens was a member of the South Carolina constitutional convention called in September 1865 shortly after the end of the Civil War. He was one of more than 100 representatives from around the state, many of them drawn from the cream of South Carolina society. During the convention, Pickens introduced a motion to repeal the Ordinance of Secession. It was almost breathtakingly brief, according to proceedings recorded by the \"Charleston Courier\":\n\n\"We, the Delegates of the People of the State of South Carolina, in General Convention met, do Ordain: That the ordinance passed in convention, 20 December 1860, withdrawing this State from the Federal Union, be and the same is hereby repealed.\"\n\nAccording to the \"New York Times\": \"The passage was received in silence – strikingly suggestive when one remembered with what dramatic applause the ordinance of secession was proclaimed passed.\"\n\nThe motion passed by a vote of 105–3 with the only dissenting votes coming from three delegates from the Barnwell District: A.P. Aldrich, J.J. Brabham and J.M. Whetstone. Pickens counseled against inaction, according to historian Francis Butler Simkins.\n\n\"It doesn't become South Carolina to vapor or swell or strut or brag or bluster or threat or swagger,\" Pickens said. \" ... She bids us bind up her wounds and pour on the oil of peace.\"\n\nPickens died in Edgefield, South Carolina, and was buried at Willow Brook Cemetery in Edgefield.\n\n"}

{"id": "2214085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214085", "title": "Surrender (military)", "text": "Surrender (military)\n\nSurrender, in military terms, is the relinquishment of control over territory, combatants, fortifications, ships or armament to another power. A surrender may be accomplished peacefully, without fighting, or it may be the result of defeat in battle. A sovereign state may surrender following defeat in a war, usually by signing a peace treaty or capitulation agreement. A battlefield surrender, either by individuals or when ordered by officers, normally results in those surrendering becoming prisoners of war.\n\nMerriam-Webster defines \"surrender\" as \"the action of yielding one's person or giving up the possession of something especially into the power of another\", and traces the etymology to the Middle English \"surrendre\", from French \"sur-\" or \"sus-\", \"suz\" \"under\" + \"rendre\" \"to give back\"; this in turn is defined by the University of Michigan Middle English Dictionary as meaning \"The giving up of an estate, a grant of land, or an interest in property to the person who holds the right to it\", or, in law, \"the relinquishing of letters patent to the king\", or \"the giving back or return of something\".\n\nA white flag or handkerchief is often taken or intended as a signal of a desire to surrender, but in international law, it simply represents a desire for a parley that may or may not result in a formal surrender. Normally, a surrender will involve the handing over of weapons; the commanding officer of a surrendering force symbolically offers his sword to the victorious commander. Individual combatants can indicate a surrender by discarding weapons and raising their hands empty and open above their heads; a surrendering tank commander should point the tank's turret away from opposing combatants. Flags and ensigns are hauled down or furled, and ships' colors are struck.\n\nWhen the parties agree to terms, the surrender may be conditional; that is, the surrendering party agrees to submit only after the victor makes certain promises. The leaders of the surrendering group negotiate privileges or compensation for the time, expense and loss of life saved by the victor through the stopping of resistance.\n\nAlternatively, in a surrender at discretion (unconditional surrender), the victor makes no promises of treatment, and unilaterally defines the treatment of the vanquished party. An early example of a military surrender is the defeat of Carthage by the Roman Empire at the end of the Second Punic War. Over time, generally accepted laws and customs of war have been developed for such a situation, most of which are laid out in the Hague Convention of 1907 and the Geneva Conventions. Normally, a belligerent will agree to surrender unconditionally only if completely incapable of continuing hostilities. Traditionally, a surrender ceremony was accompanied by the honors of war.\n\nThe Third Geneva Convention states that prisoners of war should not be mistreated or abused. US Army policy, for example, requires that surrendered persons should be secured and safeguarded while being evacuated from the battlefield.\n\nWhile not a formal military law, the Code of the US Fighting Force disallows surrender unless \"all reasonable means of resistance [are] exhausted and ... certain death the only alternative\": the Code states, \"I will never surrender of my own free will. If in command, I will never surrender the members of my command while they still have the means to resist\".\n\nFalse surrender is a type of perfidy in the context of war. It is a war crime under Protocol I of the Geneva Convention. False surrenders are usually used to draw the enemy out of cover to attack them off guard, but they may be used in larger operations such as during a siege. Accounts of false surrender can be found relatively frequently throughout history. One of the more infamous examples was the alleged false surrender of British troops at Kilmichael, during the Irish War of Independence.\n\n"}

The population of the civil parish as of the 2011 census was 574.\n\nThe village is located just off Ryknild Street, otherwise known as the A38, between Derby and Stretton, Burton upon Trent. It is historically a farming community. Due to a historical legal situation, no alcohol is allowed to be sold in the village and hence there is no village pub. \nIn Fishpond Lane there is a row of tenants' cottages, some of which have their windows bricked up, dating back to the days of window-tax.\n\nThe village does not have a war memorial in the normal sense but it has a memorial hall which doubles as the village school and as a community hall.\n\nAfter the closure of the former Burnaston Airport nearby, Derby Airfield was established at Egginton. The small airfield houses a community of light aircraft owners, an aero club and supporting aircraft maintenance firms.\n\nThe railway line which passed through Egginton originally formed part of the Great Northern Railway's Derbyshire Extension route from Grantham to Stafford and was opened in April 1878. It ran from Grantham on the East Coast Main Line via Nottingham Victoria, over Bennerley Viaduct (which still stands today) to Derby Friargate Station. This section of the Great Northern Railway, also known as the Friargate Line, (for further history about this now closed railway see GNR Derbyshire and Staffordshire Extension), was built as a rival to the already established Midland Railway which at the time had a monopoly over Derby, Nottingham and the surrounding areas.\n\nAlthough most of the line was closed to passenger traffic in December 1939, Egginton station did not officially close until 3 March 1962. The station building survives as the HQ for a payroll company. The route of the line is now a cycle track and nature path with little to indicate its former status.\n\nThe section of line between Egginton Junction and Friargate was then acquired by the Train Control Group of the BR Research Division, as a suitable test track. It was singled between Friargate and Mickleover, but in 1973 the line was cut back to Mickleover since the eastern end of the track bed had been earmarked for the new A38 trunk road. Thereafter the line was used as a test track until 1990 when the A516 feeder road to the A50 by-pass was built over the trackbed and the line was closed and lifted.\n\n"}
{"id": "2214111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214111", "title": "Factor (Scotland)", "text": "Factor (Scotland)\n\nIn Scotland a factor (or property manager) is a person or firm charged with superintending or managing properties and estates—sometimes where the owner or landlord is unable to or uninterested in attending to such details personally, or in tenements in which several owners of individual flats contribute to the factoring of communal areas.\n\nFactors can be found in solicitors firms, employed by chartered surveyors, property companies and building firms. Property factoring has a wide range of responsibilities and roles. Typically, a person would encounter a factor when renting property or subcontracting for a building firm.\n\nA factor could also be expected to deal with property repair, maintenance, cleaning, landscaping and snow removal, to be coordinated with the Landlord's wishes. Such arrangements may require the factor to collect rents, service charges and pay necessary expenses and taxes, making periodic reports to the owner, or the owner may simply delegate specific tasks and deal with others directly. \n\nA factor will often employ the services of a property services company to carry out the duties associated with the upkeep of the property (e.g. garden care, stair cleaning, car parking, etc.).\n\nHighland factors played an influential role during the 18th and 19th centuries. They were the implementers and, often, designers of the improvement programs that gave rise to the first phase of the Highland clearances, they managed famine relief, including during the Highland potato famine, they organised evictions and 'assisted passages' during the second phase of the clearances, they gave evidence to government enquiries such as the Napier Commission and they were the object of much of the protest during the crofters' war in the 1880s. \n\nIn the 17th century, Highland landowners with large estates typically used a family member to carry out the management. This was essentially a role of maintenance: collecting rents, negotiating leases (tacks) and dealing with the ordinary population of the estate. When agricultural improvement got underway in the latter part of the 18th century, new skills were required: an understanding of the latest ideas in agronomy, business acumen, together with accounting and legal knowledge. Combining these in one person created the role of the Highland factor. In addition to the technical skills, he needed to be a person of sufficient social standing to deal with larger tenants and to act as representative of the landowner in local society.\n\nGiven the size of many Highland estates, and the remote and inaccessible locations under the charge of a factor, the job required substantial physical stamina. A 20 mile round trip on foot would not be unusual. Duties had to be performed in all weathers - when Patrick Sellar went to collect rents and issue eviction notices in the winter of 1813-14, one of his guides lost several toes to frostbite in the severe conditions. Alcoholism could be the result of the isolation that a Highland factor endured, together with the unrelenting hard work. The physical and mental health of many brought an early end to their careers. However, the job was well paid, with a typical salary being £200 per annum in the middle of the 19th century, with some earning twice that amount. In addition most factors would be provided with a house and a home farm to run for their own profit (thereby giving an example of the latest agricultural methods to the tenants).\n\nHighland factors had immense power over the populations that they lived within. The security of tenure of many Highland tenants was poor (though some had longer leases that put them in a slightly better position). This caused a fear of eviction, to the extent that, at the time of the crofters' war, a speaker at a land reform meeting said \"I am ashamed to confess it now that I trembled more before the factor than I did before the Lord of Lords\". Factors were generally despised by the communities in which they lived, even after the clearances had ceased. The gaelic-speaking tenants would blame the factor for unpopular policies, but often would not criticise the landowner whose instructions he was following. This tied in with the peasantry clinging to the old values of Highland life, such as \"\", something that was steadily abandoned by the ruling classes as their estates became commercialised.\n\nThe large landholdings in the Highlands meant that only a small group of people were needed to fill all the positions. Those who were able to take this career path were usually trained by working under the direction of an experienced factor. Many sons followed their fathers into factorship, thereby saving some of the costs of training. Those without a family background often came from accountancy or the legal profession.\n\nThe opinions of factors on their work are available from a few published accounts. In the main era of clearance, Patrick Sellar emphatically made the case for the changes made under him and on other estates - an opinion from which he never deviated. He felt that his own family had benefited from the clearance of his grandfather (who had been a stonemason), starting the Sellars on a path of upward mobility. In a later generation of factors, Evander McIver steadfastedly criticised the existence of overcrowded crofting communities that had been created in the first phase of the clearances. He believed that the economic system was flawed, with neither the estate nor the crofters able to make a decent income from the resources available. This was a widely held view among post-clearance factors, so explaining their support of emigration programs from the congested districts.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2214112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214112", "title": "C data types", "text": "C data types\n\nIn the C programming language, data types constitute the semantics and characteristics of storage of data elements. They are expressed in the language syntax in form of declarations for memory locations or variables. Data types also determine the types of operations or methods of processing of data elements. \n\nThe C language provides basic arithmetic types, such as integer and real number types, and syntax to build array and compound types. \"Headers\" for the C standard library, to be used via include directives, contain definitions of support types, that have additional properties, such as providing storage with an exact size, independent of the language implementation on specific hardware platforms.\n\nThe C language provides the four basic arithmetic type specifiers \"char\", \"int\", \"float\" and \"double\", and the modifiers \"signed\", \"unsigned\", \"short\", and \"long\". The following table lists the permissible combinations in specifying a large set of storage size-specific declarations.\n\nThe actual size of the integer types varies by implementation. The standard requires only size relations between the data types and minimum sizes for each data type:\n\nThe relation requirements are that the codice_1 is not smaller than codice_2, which is not smaller than codice_3, which is not smaller than codice_4. As codice_5's size is always the minimum supported data type, no other data types (except bit-fields) can be smaller.\n\nThe minimum size for codice_5 is 8 bits, the minimum size for codice_4 and codice_3 is 16 bits, for codice_2 it is 32 bits and codice_1 must contain at least 64 bits.\n\nThe type codice_3 should be the integer type that the target processor is most efficiently working with. This allows great flexibility: for example, all types can be 64-bit. However, several different integer width schemes (data models) are popular. Because the data model defines how different programs communicate, a uniform data model is used within a given operating system application interface.\n\nIn practice, codice_5 is usually 8 bits in size and codice_4 is usually 16 bits in size (as are their unsigned counterparts). This holds true for platforms as diverse as 1990s SunOS 4 Unix, Microsoft MS-DOS, modern Linux, and Microchip MCC18 for embedded 8-bit PIC microcontrollers. POSIX requires codice_5 to be exactly 8 bits in size.\n\nVarious rules in the C standard make codice_15 the basic type used for arrays suitable to store arbitrary non-bit-field objects: its lack of padding bits and trap representations, the definition of \"object representation\", and the possibility of aliasing.\n\nThe actual size and behavior of floating-point types also vary by implementation. The only guarantee is that codice_16 is not smaller than codice_17, which is not smaller than codice_18. Usually, the 32-bit and 64-bit IEEE 754 binary floating-point formats are used.\n\nThe C99 standard includes new real floating-point types codice_19 and codice_20, defined in codice_21. They correspond to the types used for the intermediate results of floating-point expressions when codice_22 is 0, 1, or 2. These types may be wider than codice_16.\n\nC99 also added complex types: codice_24, codice_25, codice_26.\n\nC99 added a boolean (true/false) type codice_27. Additionally, the codice_28 header defines codice_29 as a convenient alias for this type, and also provides macros for codice_30 and codice_31. codice_27 functions similarly to a normal integer type, with one exception: any assignments to a codice_27 that are not 0 (false) are stored as 1 (true). This behavior exists to avoid integer overflows in implicit narrowing conversions. For example, in the following code:\nunsigned char b = 256;\n\nif (b) {\n\nVariable codice_34 evaluates to false if codice_15 has a size of 8 bits. This is because the value 256 does not fit in the data type, which results in the lower 8 bits of it being used, resulting in a zero value. However, changing the type causes the previous code to behave normally:\n_Bool b = 256;\n\nif (b) {\n\nThe type \"_Bool\" also ensures true values always compare equal to each other:\n_Bool a = 1, b = 2;\n\nif (a == b) {\n\nThe C language specification includes the typedefs codice_36 and codice_37 to represent memory-related quantities. Their size is defined according to the target processor's arithmetic capabilities, not the memory capabilities, such as available address space. Both of these types are defined in the codice_38 header (codice_39 in C++).\n\ncodice_36 is an unsigned integer type used to represent the size of any object (including arrays) in the particular implementation. The operator sizeof yields a value of the type codice_36. The maximum size of codice_36 is provided via codice_43, a macro constant which is defined in the codice_44 header (codice_45 header in C++). codice_36 is guaranteed to be at least 16 bits wide. Additionally, POSIX includes codice_47, which is a signed integer type of the same width as codice_36.\n\ncodice_37 is a signed integer type used to represent the difference between pointers. It is guaranteed to be valid only against pointers of the same type; subtraction of pointers consisting of different types is implementation-defined.\n\nInformation about the actual properties, such as size, of the basic arithmetic types, is provided via macro constants in two headers: codice_50 header (codice_51 header in C++) defines macros for integer types and codice_52 header (codice_53 header in C++) defines macros for floating-point types. The actual values depend on the implementation.\n\n\n\nThe C99 standard includes definitions of several new integer types to enhance the portability of programs. The already available basic integer types were deemed insufficient, because their actual sizes are implementation defined and may vary across different systems. The new types are especially useful in embedded environments where hardware usually supports only several types and that support varies between different environments. All new types are defined in codice_112 header (codice_113 header in C++) and also are available at codice_44 header (codice_45 header in C++). The types can be grouped into the following categories:\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the types and the interface to acquire the implementation details (\"n\" refers to the number of bits):\n\nThe codice_112 header (codice_113 in C++) provides features that enhance the functionality of the types defined in the codice_44 header. It defines macros for printf format string and scanf format string specifiers corresponding to the types defined in codice_44 and several functions for working with the codice_120 and codice_121 types. This header was added in C99.\n\n\nThe macros are in the format codice_122. Here \"{fmt}\" defines the output formatting and is one of codice_123 (decimal), codice_124 (hexadecimal), codice_125 (octal), codice_126 (unsigned) and codice_127 (integer). \"{type}\" defines the type of the argument and is one of codice_128, codice_129, codice_130, codice_131, codice_132, where codice_128 corresponds to the number of bits in the argument.\n\n\nThe macros are in the format codice_134. Here \"{fmt}\" defines the output formatting and is one of codice_123 (decimal), codice_124 (hexadecimal), codice_125 (octal), codice_126 (unsigned) and codice_127 (integer). \"{type}\" defines the type of the argument and is one of codice_128, codice_129, codice_130, codice_131, codice_132, where codice_128 corresponds to the number of bits in the argument.\n\n\nSimilarly to the fixed-width integer types, ISO/IEC TS 18661 specifies floating-point types for IEEE 754 interchange and extended formats in binary and decimal:\n\nStructures aggregate the storage of multiple data items, of potentially differing data types, into one memory block referenced by a single variable. The following example declares the data type codice_150 which contains the name and birthday of a person. The structure definition is followed by a declaration of the variable codice_151 that allocates the needed storage.\nstruct birthday {\n\nstruct birthday John;\nThe memory layout of a structure is a language implementation issue for each platform, with a few restrictions. The memory address of the first member must be the same as the address of structure itself. Structures may be initialized or assigned to using compound literals. A function may directly return a structure, although this is often not efficient at run-time. Since C99, a structure may also end with a flexible array member.\n\nA structure containing a pointer to a structure of its own type is commonly used to build linked data structures:\n\nstruct node {\n\nFor every type codice_152, except void and function types, there exist the types \"\"array of codice_153 elements of type codice_152\"\". An array is a collection of values, all of the same type, stored contiguously in memory. An array of size codice_153 is indexed by integers from codice_156 up to and including codice_157. Here is a brief example:\nint cat[10]; // array of 10 elements, each of type int\nArrays can be initialized with a compound initializer, but not assigned. Arrays are passed to functions by passing a pointer to the first element. Multidimensional arrays are defined as \"\"array of array …\"\", and all except the outermost dimension must have compile-time constant size:\nint a[10][8]; // array of 10 elements, each of type 'array of 8 int elements'\nEvery data type codice_152 has a corresponding type \"pointer to codice_152\". A pointer is a data type that contains the address of a storage location of a variable of a particular type. They are declared with the asterisk (codice_160) type declarator following the basic storage type and preceding the variable name. Whitespace before or after the asterisk is optional.\n\nchar *square;\nlong *circle;\nint *oval;\nPointers may also be declared for pointer data types, thus creating multiple indirect pointers, such as and , including pointers to array types. The latter are less common than an array of pointers, and their syntax may be confusing:\n\nchar *pc[10]; // array of 10 elements of 'pointer to char'\nchar (*pa)[10]; // pointer to a 10-element array of char\nThe element codice_161 requires ten blocks of memory of the size of \"pointer to codice_5\" (usually 40 or 80 bytes on common platforms), but element codice_163 is only one pointer (size 4 or 8 bytes), and the data it refers to is an array of ten bytes ().\n\nA union type is a special construct that permits access to the same memory block by using a choice of differing type descriptions. For example, a union of data types may be declared to permit reading the same data either as an integer, a float, or any other user declared type:\n\nunion {\n} u;\n\nThe total size of codice_126 is the size of codice_165 — which happens to be the sum of the sizes of codice_166 and codice_167 — since codice_168 is larger than both codice_127 and codice_170. When assigning something to codice_171, some parts of codice_172 may be preserved if codice_171 is smaller than codice_172.\n\nReading from a union member is not the same as casting since the value of the member is not converted, but merely read.\n\nFunction pointers allow referencing functions with a particular signature. For example, to store the address of the standard function codice_175 in the variable codice_176:\nint (*my_int_f)(int) = &abs;\n// the & operator can be omitted, but makes clear that the \"address of\" abs is used here\nFunction pointers are invoked by name just like normal function calls. Function pointers are separate from pointers and void pointers.\n\nThe aforementioned types can be characterized further by type qualifiers, yielding a \"qualified type\". and C11, there are four type qualifiers in standard C: codice_177 (C89), codice_178 (C89), codice_179 (C99) and codice_180 (C11) the latter has a private name to avoid clashing with user names, but the more ordinary name codice_181 can be used if the codice_182 header is included. Of these, codice_177 is by far the best-known and most used, appearing in the standard library and encountered in any significant use of the C language, which must satisfy const-correctness. The other qualifiers are used for low-level programming, and while widely used there, are rarely used by typical programmers.\n\n"}

{"id": "2214121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214121", "title": "European Train Control System", "text": "European Train Control System\n\nThe European Train Control System (ETCS) is the signalling and control component of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). It is a replacement for legacy train protection systems and designed to replace the many incompatible safety systems currently used by European railways. The standard was also adopted outside Europe and is an option for worldwide application. In technical terms it is a kind of positive train control.\n\nETCS is implemented with standard trackside equipment and unified controlling equipment within the train cab. In its advanced form, all lineside information is passed to the driver wireless inside the cab, removing the need for lineside signals watched by the driver. This will give the foundation for a later to be defined automatic train operation. Trackside equipment aims to exchange information with the vehicle for safely supervising train circulation. The information exchanged between track and trains can be either continuous or intermittent according to the ERTMS/ETCS level of application and to the nature of the information itself.\n\nThe need for a system like ETCS stems from more and longer running trains resulting from economic integration of the European Union (EU) and the liberalisation of national railway markets. At the beginning of the 1990s there were some national high speed train projects supported by the EU which lacked interoperability of trains. This catalysed the Directive 1996/48 about the interoperability of high-speed trains, followed by Directive 2001/16 extending the concept of interoperability to the conventional rail system. ETCS specifications have become part of, or are referred to, the Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI) for (railway) control-command systems, pieces of European legislation managed by the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA). It is a legal requirement that all new, upgraded or renewed tracks and rolling stock in the European railway system should adopt ETCS, possibly keeping legacy systems for backward compatibility. Many networks outside the EU have also adopted ETCS, generally for high-speed rail projects. The main goal of achieving interoperability had mixed success in the beginning.\n\nDeployment has been slow, as there is no business case for replacing existing train protection systems, especially in Germany and France which already had advanced train protection systems installed in most mainlines. Even though these legacy systems were developed in the 1960s, they provided similar performance to ETCS Level 2, thus the reluctance of infrastructure managers to replace these systems with ETCS. There are also significant problems regarding compatibility of the latest software releases or baselines of infrastructure-side equipment with older on-board equipment, forcing in many cases the train operating companies to replace ETCS equipment after only a few years. Switzerland, an early adopter of ETCS Limited Supervision, has introduced a moratorium on its planned roll-out of ETCS Level 2 due to cost and capacity concerns, added to fears about GSM-R obsolence starting in 2030.\n\nThe European railway network grew from separate national networks with little more in common than standard gauge. Notable differences include voltages, loading gauge, couplings, signalling and control systems. By the end of the 1980s there were 14 national standard train control systems in use across the EU, and the advent of high-speed trains showed that signalling based on lineside signals is insufficient.\n\nBoth factors led to efforts to reduce the time and cost of cross-border traffic. On 4 and 5 December 1989, a working group including Transport Ministers resolved a master plan for a trans-European high-speed rail network, the first time that ETCS was suggested. The Commission communicated the decision to the European Council, which approved the plan in its resolution of 17 December 1990. This led to a resolution on 91/440/EEC as of 29 July 1991, which mandated the creation of a requirements list for interoperability in high-speed rail transport. The rail manufacturing industry and rail network operators had agreed on creation of interoperability standards in June 1991. Until 1993, the organizational framework was created to start technical specifications that would be published as Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI). The mandate for TSI was resolved by 93/38/EEC. In 1995, a development plan first mentioned the creation of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS).\n\nBecause ETCS is in many parts implemented in software, some wording from software technology is used. Versions are called system requirements specifications (SRS). This is a bundle of documents, which may have different versioning for each document. A main version is called baseline (BL).\n\nThe specification was written in 1996 in response to EU Council Directive 96/48/EC99 of 23 July 1996 on interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system. First the European Railway Research Institute was instructed to formulate the specification and about the same time the \"ERTMS User Group\" was formed from six railway operators that took over the lead role in the specification. The standardisation went on for the next two years and it was felt to be slow for some industry partners – 1998 saw the formation of \"Union of Signalling Industry\" (UNISIG), including Alstom, Ansaldo, Bombardier, Invensys, Siemens and Thales that were to take over the finalisation of the standard.\n\nIn July 1998, \"SRS 5a\" documents were published that formed the first baseline for technical specifications. UNISIG provided for corrections and enhancements of the baseline specification leading to the \"Class P\" specification in April 1999. This baseline specification has been tested by six railways since 1999 as part of the ERTMS.\n\nThe railway companies defined some extended requirements that were included to ETCS (e.g. RBC-Handover and track profile information), leading to the \"Class 1\" \"SRS 2.0.0\" specification of ETCS (published in April 2000). Further specification continued through a number of drafts until UNISIG published the SUBSET-026 defining the current implementation of ETCS signalling equipment – this \"Class 1\" \"SRS 2.2.2\" was accepted by the European Commission in decision 2002/731/EEC as mandatory for high-speed rail and in decision 2004/50/EEC as mandatory for conventional rail. The SUBSET-026 is defined from eight chapters where chapter seven defines the ETCS language and chapter eight describes the balise telegram structure of \"ETCS Level 1\". Later UNISIG published the corrections as SUBSET-108 (known as \"Class 1\" \"SRS 2.2.2 \"+\"),\" that was accepted in decision 2006/679/EEC.\n\nThe earlier ETCS specification contained a lot of optional elements that limited interoperability. The \"Class 1\" specifications were revised in the following year leading to \"SRS 2.3.0\" document series that was made mandatory by the \"European Commission\" in decision 2007/153/EEC on 9 March 2007. Annex A describes the technical specifications on interoperability for high-speed (HS) and conventional rail (CR) transport. Using \"SRS 2.3.0\" a number of railway operators started to deploy ETCS on a large scale, for example the Italian Sistema Controllo Marcia Treno (SCMT) is based on Level 1 balises. Further development concentrated on compatibility specification with the earlier \"Class B\" systems leading to specifications like EuroZUB that continued to use the national rail management on top of Eurobalises for a transitional period. Following the experience in railway operation the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) published a revised specification \"Class 1\" \"SRS 2.3.0d\" (\"debugged\") that was accepted by the European Commission in April 2008.\n\nThis compilation SRS 2.3.0d was declared final (later called Baseline 2) in this series. There were a list of unresolved functional requests and a need for stability in practical rollouts. So in parallel started the development of baseline 3 series to incorporate open requests, strip off unneeded stuff and combine it with solutions found for baseline 2. The structure of functional levels was continued.\n\nWhile some countries switched to ETCS with some benefit, German and French railway operators had already introduced modern types of train protection systems so they would gain no benefit. Instead, ideas were introduced on new modes like \"Limited Supervision\" (known at least since 2004) that would allow for\nThese ideas were compiled into a \"baseline 3\" series by the ERA and published as a \"Class 1 SRS 3.0.0 proposal\" on 23 December 2008. The first consolidation \"SRS 3.1.0\" of the proposal was published by ERA on 26 February 2010 and the second consolidation \"SRS 3.2.0\" on 11 January 2011. The specification \"GSM-R Baseline 0\" was published as Annex A to the \"baseline 3 proposal\" on 17 April 2012. At the same time a change to Annex A of \"SRS 2.3.0d\" was proposed to the \"European Commission\" that includes \"GSM-R baseline 0\" allowing ETCS \"SRS 3.3.0\" trains to run on \"SRS 2.3.0d\" tracks. The \"baseline 3 proposal\" was accepted by the \"European Commission\" with decision 2012/88/EU on 25. January 2012. The update for \"SRS 3.3.0\" and the extension for \"SRS 2.3.0d\" were accepted by the \"European Commission\" with decision 2012/696/EU on 6. November 2012.\n\nThe ERA work programme concentrated on the refinement of the test specification \"SRS 3.3.0\" that was to be published in July 2013. In parallel the GSM-R specification was to be extended into a \"GSM-R baseline 1\" until the end of 2013. The German Deutsche Bahn has since announced equipping at least the TEN Corridors running on older tracks to be using either \"Level 1 Limited Supervision\" or \"Level 2\" on high-speed sections. Current work continues on \"Level 3\" definition with low-cost specifications (compare ERTMS Regional) and the integration of GPRS into the radio protocol to increase the signalling bandwidth as required in shunting stations. The specifications for \"ETCS baseline 3\" and \"GSM-R baseline 0\" (Baseline 3 Maintenance Release 1) were published as recommendations \"SRS 3.4.0\" by the ERA in May 2014 for submission to the \"Railway Interoperability and Safety Committee\" (RISC) in a meeting in June 2014. The SRS 3.4.0 was accepted by the \"European Commission\" with the amending decision 2015/14/EU on 5. January 2015.\n\nStakeholders such as Deutsche Bahn have opted for a streamlined development model for ETCS – DB will assemble a database of change requests (CRs) to be assembled by priority and effect in a CR-list for the next milestone report (MRs) that shall be published on fixed dates through ERA. The \"SRS 3.4.0\" from Q2 2014 matches with the MR1 from this process. The further steps were planned for the MR2 to be published in Q4 2015 (that became the \"SRS 3.5.0\") and the MR3 to be published in Q3 2017 (whereas \"SRS 3.6.0\" was settled earlier in June 2016). Each specification will be commented on and handed over to the RISC for subsequent legalization in the European Union. Deutsche Bahn has expressed a commitment to keep the Baseline 3 specification backward compatible starting at least with SRS 3.5.0 that is due in 2015 according to the streamlined MR2 process, with the MR1 adding requirements from its tests in preparation for the switch to ETCS (for example better frequency filters for the GSM-R radio equipment). The intention is based on plans to start replacing its PZB train protection system at the time.\n\nIn December 2015, the ERA published the \"Baseline 3 Release 2\" (B3R2) series including \"GSM-R Baseline 1\". The B3R2 is publicly named to be not an update to the previous \"Baseline 3 Maintenance Release 1\" (B3MR1). The notable change is the inclusion of EGPRS (GPRS with mandatory EDGE support) in the GSM-R specification, corresponding to the new Eirene FRS 8 / SRS 16 specifications. Additionally B3R2 includes the ETCS \"Driver Machine Interface\" and the SRS 3.5.0. This Baseline 3 series was accepted by \"European Commission\" with decisions 2016/919/EC in late May 2016. The decision references ETCS \"SRS 3.6.0\" that was subsequently published by the ERA in a \"Set 3\" in June 2016. The publications of the \"European Commission\" and ERA for \"SRS 3.6.0\" were synchronized to the same day, 15 June. The \"Set 3\" of B3R2 is marked as the stable basis for subsequent ERTMS deployments in the EU.\n\nThe name of Set 3 follows the style of publications of the decisions of the European Commission where updates to the Baseline 2 and Baseline 3 specifications were accepted at the same time – for example decision 2015/14/EU of January 2015 has two tables \"Set of specifications # 1 (ETCS baseline 2 and GSM-R baseline 0)\" and \"Set of specifications # 2 (ETCS baseline 3 and GSM-R baseline 0)\". In the decision of May 2016 there are three tables: \"Set of specifications # 1 (ETCS Baseline 2 and GSM-R Baseline 1)\", \"Set of specifications # 2 (ETCS Baseline 3 Maintenance Release 1 and GSM-R Baseline 1)\", and \"Set of specifications # 3\n(ETCS Baseline 3 Release 2 and GSM-R Baseline 1)\". In that decision the SRS (System Requirement Specification) and DMI (ETCS Driver Machine Interface) are kept at 3.4.0 for Set 2 while updating Set 3 to SRS and DMI 3.6.0. All three of the tables (Set 1, Set 2 and Set 3) are updated to include the latest EIRENE FRS 8.0.0 including the same GSM-R SRS 16.0.0 to ensure interoperability. In that decision the SRS is kept at 2.3.0 for Set 1 – and the decision of 2012/88/EU was repealed that was first introducing the interoperability of Set 1 and Set 2 (with SRS 3.3.0 at the time) based on GSM-R Baseline 0.\n\nIntroduction of Baseline 3 on railways require installation of it on board, which require re-certification of trains. This will cost less than first ETCS certification, but still around €100k per vehicle.\n\nThe first live tests of Baseline 3 took place in Denmark July 2016. Denmark wants to install ERTMS on all its railways, and then use Baseline 3.\n\nBritish freight and passenger operators have signed contracts to install Baseline 3 in their trains, the first around 2020.\n\nThe development of ETCS has matured to a point that cross-border traffic is possible and some countries have announced a date for the end of older systems. The first contract to run the full length of a cross-border railway was signed by Germany and France in 2004 on the high-speed line from Paris to Frankfurt, including LGV Est. The connection opened in 2007 using ICE3MF, to be operational with ETCS trains by 2016. The Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and Italy have a commitment to open Corridor A from Rotterdam to Genoa for freight by the start of 2015. Non-European countries also are starting to deploy ERTMS/ETCS, including Algeria, China, India, Israel, Kazakhstan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, and Saudi Arabia. Australia will switch to ETCS on some dedicated lines starting in 2013.\n\nThe \"European Commission\" has mandated that European railways to publish their deployment planning up to 5 July 2017. This will be used to create a geographical and technical database (TENtec) that can show the ETCS deployment status on the Trans-European Network. From the comparative overview the commission wants to identify the needs for additional coordination measures to support the implementation. Synchronous with the publication of \"ETCS SRS 3.6.0\" on 15 June 2017 the Regulation 2016/796/EC was published. It mandates the replacement of the \"European Railways Agency\" by the \"European Union Agency for Railways.\" The agency was tasked with the creation of a regulatory framework for a Single European Railway Area (SERA) in the \"4th Railway Package\" to be resolved in late June 2016. A week later the new EU \"Agency for Railways\" emphasized the stability of B3R2 and the usage as the foundation for oncoming ETCS implementations in the EU. Based on projections in the \"Rhine-Alps-Corridor\", a break-even of the cross-border ETCS implementation is expected in the early 2030s. A new memorandum of understanding was signed on InnoTrans in September 2016 for a completion of the first ETCS Deployment Plan targets by 2022. The new planning was accepted by the \"European Commission\" in January 2017 with a goal to have 50% of the Core Network Corridors equipped by 2023 and the remainder in a second phase up to 2030.\n\nThe costs for the switch to ETCS are well documented in the Swiss reports from their railway operator SBB to the railway authority BAV. In December 2016 it was shown that they could start switching parts of the system to ETCS Level 2 whenever a section needs improvement. This would not only result in a network where sections of ETCS and the older ZUB would switch back and forth along lines, but the full transition to ETCS would last until 2060 and its cost were estimated at 9.5 billion Swiss Franc (US$ ). The expected advantages of ETCS for more security and up to 30% more throughput would also be at stake. Thus legislation favours the second option where the internal equipment of interlocking stations would be replaced by new electronic ETCS desks before switching the network to ETCS Level 2. However the current railway equipment manufacturers did not provide enough technology options at the time of the report to start it off. So the plan would be to run feasibility studies until 2019 with a projected start of changeover set to 2025. A rough estimate indicates that the switch to ETCS Level 2 could be completed within 13 years from that point and it would cost about 6.1 billion Swiss Franc (US$ ). For comparison, SBB indicated that the maintenance of lineside signals would also cost about 6.5 billion Swiss Franc (US$ ) which however can be razed once Level 2 is effective.\n\nThe Swiss findings influenced the German project \"Digitale Schiene\" (digital rail). It is estimated that 80% of the rail network can be operated by GSM-R without lineside signals. This will bring about 20% more trains that can be operated in the country. The project was unveiled in January 2018 and it will start off with a feasibility study on electronic interlocking stations that should show a transition plan by mid 2018. It is expected that 80% of the network have been rebuilt to the radio-controlled system by 2030. This is more extensive than earlier plans which focused more on ETCS Level 1 with Limited Supervision instead of Level 2.\n\nThe ETCS standard has listed a number of older Automatic Train Controls (ATC) as \"Class B\" systems. While they are set to obsolescence, the older line side signal information can be read by using \"Specific Transmission Modules\" (STM) hardware and fed the \"Class B\" signal information to a new ETCS onboard safety control system for partial supervision. In practice, an alternative transition scheme is used where an older ATC is rebased to use Eurobalises. This leverages the fact that a Eurobalise can transmit multiple information packets and the reserved national datagram (packet number 44) can encode the signal values from the old system in parallel with ETCS datagram packets. The older train-born ATC system is equipped with an additional Eurobalise reader that converts the datagram signals. This allows for a longer transitional period where the old ATC and Eurobalises are attached on the sleepers until all trains have a Eurobalise reader. The newer ETCS-compliant trains can be switched to an ETCS operation scheme by a software update of the onboard train computer.\n\nIn Switzerland, a replacement of the older Integra-Signum magnets and ZUB 121 magnets to Eurobalises in the Euro-Signum plus EuroZUB operation scheme is under way. All trains had been equipped with Eurobalise readers and signal converters until 2005 (generally called \"Rucksack\" \"\"). The general operation scheme will be switched to ETCS by 2017 with an allowance for older trains to run on specific lines with EuroZUB until 2025.\n\nIn Belgium, the TBL 1 crocodiles were complemented with Eurobalises in the TBL 1+ operation scheme. The TBL 1+ definition allowed for an additional speed restriction to be transmitted to the train computer already. Likewise in Luxembourg the \"Memor II\" (using crocodiles) was extended into a \"Memor II+\" operation scheme.\n\nIn Berlin, the old mechanical train stops on the local S-Bahn rapid transit system are replaced by Eurobalises in the newer ZBS train control system. Unlike the other systems it is not meant to be transitional for a later ETCS operation scheme. The signalling centres and the train computer use ETCS components with a specific software version, manufacturers like Siemens point out that their ETCS systems can be switched for operating on ETCS, TBL, or ZBS lines.\n\nThe Wuppertal Suspension Railway called for bids on a modernization of its train protection and management system. Alstom won the tender with a plan largely composed of ETCS components. Instead of GSM-R the system uses TETRA which had been in use already for voice communication. The TETRA system will be expanded to allow movement authority being signaled by digital radio. Because train integrity will not be checked, the solution was called as ETCS Level 2+ by the manufacturer. Train integrity is the level of belief in the train being complete and not having left coaches or wagons behind. The usage of moving blocks was dropped however while the system was implemented with just 256 balises checking the odometry of the trains that signal their position by radio to the ETCS control center. It is expected that headways will drop from 3,5 minutes to 2 minutes when the system is activated. The system has been inaugurated on 01/09/2019.\n\nETCS is specified at four numbered levels:\n\nLevel 0 applies when an ETCS-fitted vehicle is used on a non-ETCS route. The trainborne equipment monitors the maximum speed of that type of train. The train driver observes the trackside signals. Since signals can have different meanings on different railways, this level places additional requirements on drivers' training. If the train has left a higher-level ETCS, it might be limited in speed globally by the last balises encountered.\n\nLevel 1 is a cab signalling system that can be superimposed on the existing signalling system, leaving the fixed signalling system (national signalling and track-release system) in place. Eurobalise radio beacons pick up signal aspects from the trackside signals via signal adapters and telegram coders (\"Lineside Electronics Unit\" – LEU) and transmit them to the vehicle as a \"movement authority\" together with route data at fixed points. The on-board computer continuously monitors and calculates the maximum speed and the \"braking curve\" from these data. Because of the spot transmission of data, the train must travel over the Eurobalise beacon to obtain the next \"movement authority\". In order for a stopped train to be able to move (when the train is not stopped exactly over a balise), there are optical signals that show permission to proceed. With the installation of additional Eurobalises (\"\"infill balises\"\") or a \"EuroLoop\" between the distant signal and main signal, the new proceed aspect is transmitted continuously. The EuroLoop is an extension of the Eurobalise over a particular distance that basically allows data to be transmitted continuously to the vehicle over cables emitting electromagnetic waves. A radio version of the EuroLoop is also possible.\n\nFor example, in Norway and Sweden the meanings of single green and double green are contradictory. Drivers have to know the difference (already with traditional systems) to drive beyond the national borders safely. In Sweden, the \"ETCS Level 1\" list of signal aspects are not fully included in the traditional list, so there is a special marking saying that such signals have slightly different meanings.\n\nWhereas ETCS L1 Full Supervision requires supervision to be provided at every signal, ETCS L1 Limited Supervision allows for only a part of the signals to be included, thus allowing to tailor the installation of equipment, only to points of the network where the increase in functionality justifies the costs. Formally, this is possible for all ETCS levels, but it is currently only applied with Level 1. As supervision is not provided at every signal, this implies that cab signalling is not available and the driver must still look out for trackside signals. For this reason, the level of safety is not as high, as not all signals are included and there is still reliance on the driver seeing and respecting the trackside signalling. Studies have shown that \"ETCS L1 LS\" has the same capacity as plain Level 1 FS for half the cost . Cost advantages come from reduced efforts necessary for calibrating, configurating and designing the track equipment and ETCS telegramms. Another advantage is, that \"Limited Supervision\" has little requirements for the underlying interlocking, hence it can be applied even on lines with mechanical interlockings as long as LEUs can read respective signal aspects. In contrast Level 2 requires to replace older interlockings with electronic or digital interlockings. That has led to railway operators pushing for the inclusion of \"Limited Supervision\" into the \"ETCS Baseline 3\". Although interoperable according to TSI, implementations of \"Limited Supervision\" are much more diverse than other ECTS modes, e.g. functionality of L1LS in Germany is strongly based on PZB principles of operation and common signal distances.\n\n\"Limited Supervision\" mode was proposed by RFF/SNCF (France) based on a proposal by SBB (Switzerland). Several years later a steering group was announced in spring 2004. After the UIC workshop on 30 June 2004 it was agreed that UIC should produce a \"FRS document\" as the first step. The resulting proposal was distributed to the eight administrations that were identified: ÖBB (Austria), SNCB/NMBS (Belgium), BDK (Denmark), DB Netze (Germany), RFI (Italy), CFR (Romania), Network Rail (UK) and SBB (Switzerland). After 2004 German Deutsche Bahn took over the responsibility for the change request.\n\nIn Switzerland the \"Federal Office of Transport\" (BAV) announced in August 2011 that beginning with 2018 the Eurobalise-based EuroZUB/EuroSignum signalling will be switched to Level 1 Limited Supervision. High-speed lines are already using ETCS Level 2. The north–south corridor should be switched to ETCS by 2015 according to international contracts regarding the TEN-T Corridor-A from Rotterdam to Genova (European backbone). But it is delayed and will be usable with December 2017 timetable change.\n\nLevel 2 is a digital radio-based system. \"Movement authority\" and other signal aspects are displayed in the cab for the driver. Apart from a few indicator panels, it is therefore possible to dispense with trackside signalling. However, the train detection and the train integrity supervision still remain in place at the trackside. Train movements are monitored continually by the \"radio block centre\" using this trackside-derived information. The \"movement authority\" is transmitted to the vehicle continuously via GSM-R or GPRS together with speed information and route data. The Eurobalises are used at this level as passive positioning beacons or \"electronic milestones\". Between two positioning beacons, the train determines its position via sensors (axle transducers, accelerometer and radar). The positioning beacons are used in this case as reference points for correcting distance measurement errors. The on-board computer continuously monitors the transferred data and the maximum permissible speed.\n\nWith Level 3, ETCS goes beyond pure train protection functionality with the implementation of full radio-based train spacing. Fixed train detection devices (GFM) are no longer required. As with Level 2, trains find their position themselves by means of positioning beacons and via sensors (axle transducers, accelerometer and radar) and must also be capable of determining train integrity on board to the very highest degree of reliability. By transmitting the positioning signal to the radio block centre, it is always possible to determine that point on the route the train has safely cleared. The following train can already be granted another \"movement authority\" up to this point. The route is thus no longer cleared in fixed track sections. In this respect, Level 3 departs from classic operation with fixed intervals: given sufficiently short positioning intervals, continuous line-clear authorisation is achieved and train headways come close to the principle of operation with absolute braking distance spacing (\"moving block\"). Level 3 uses radio to pass movement authorities to the train. Level 3 uses train reported position and integrity to determine if it is safe to issue the movement authority. Level 3 is currently under development. Solutions for reliable train integrity supervision are highly complex and are hardly suitable for transfer to older models of freight rolling stock. The Confirmed Safe Rear End (CSRE) is the point in rear of the train at the furthest extent of the safety margin. If the Safety margin is zero, the CSRE aligns with the Confirmed Rear End. Some kind of end-of-train device is needed or special lines for rolling stock with included integrity checks like commuter multiple units or high speed passenger trains. A ghost train is a vehicle in the Level 3 Area that are not known to the Level 3 Track-side.\n\nA variant of Level 3 is ERTMS Regional, which has the option to be used with virtual fixed blocks or with true moving block signalling. It was early defined and implemented in a cost sensitive environment in Sweden. In 2016 with \"SRS 3.5+\" it was adopted by core standards and is now officially part of Baseline 3 Level 3.\n\nIt is possible to use train integrity supervision, or by accepting limited speed and traffic volume to lessen the effect and probability of colliding with detached rail vehicles. \"ERTMS Regional\" has lower commissioning and maintenance costs, since trackside train detection devices are not routinely used, and is suitable for lines with low traffic volume. These low-density lines usually have no automatic train protection system today, and thus will benefit from the added safety.\n\nInstead of using fixed balises to detect train location there may be \"virtual balises\" based on satellite navigation and GNSS augmentation. Several studies about the usage of GNSS in railway signalling solutions have been researched by the UIC (GADEROS/GEORAIL) and ESA (RUNE/INTEGRAIL). Experiences in the LOCOPROL project show that real balises are still required in railway stations, junctions, and other areas where greater positional accuracy is required. The successful usage of satellite navigation in the GLONASS-based Russian ABTC-M block control has triggered the creation of the ITARUS-ATC system that integrates Level 2 RBC elements – the manufacturers Ansaldo STS and VNIIAS aim for certification of the ETCS compatibility of this system.\n\nThe first real implementation of the virtual balise concept has been done during the ESA project \"3InSat\" on 50 km of track of the Cagliari–Golfo Aranci Marittima railway on Sardinia in which a SIL-4 train localisation at signalling system level has been developed using differential GPS.\n\nThere is a pilot project \"\"ERSAT EAV\"\" running since 2015 with the objective to verify the suitability of EGNSS as the enabler of cost-efficient and economically sustainable ERTMS signalling solutions for safety railway applications.\n\nAnsaldo STS has come to lead the UNISIG working group on GNSS integration into ERTMS within \"Next Generation Train Control\" (NGTC) WP7, whose main scope is to specify ETCS virtual balise functionality, taking into account the interoperability requirement. Following the NGTC specifications the future interoperable GNSS positioning systems, supplied by different manufacturers, will reach the defined positioning performance in the locations of the virtual balises.\n\nAll the trains compliant with ETCS will be fitted with on-board systems certified by Notified Bodies. This equipment consists of wireless communication, rail path sensing, central logic unit, cab displays and control devices for driver action.\nThe Man Machine Interface (MMI) is the standardised interface for the driver, also called \"Driver Machine Interface\" (DMI). It consists of a set of colour displays with touch input for ETCS and separate for GSM-R communication. This is added with control devices specific for the train type.\nThe Specific Transmission Module (STM) is a special interface for the EVC for communicating with legacy Class B \"ATP\" systems like PZB, Memor and ATB. It consists of specific sensing elements to lineside installations and an interface for hardware and logic adapting interface to EVC. The EVC must get special software for translation of legacy signals to unified internal ETCS communication. The driver is using standard ETCS cab equipment also on non ETCS lines. The STM enables therefore the usage of the ETCS equipped driving vehicle on the non-equipped network and is today essential for interoperability.\nThe Balise Transmission Module (BTM) is an set with antennas and the wireless interface for reading data telegrams from and writing to eurobalises.\nThe odometric sensors are significant for exact position determination. In ETCS Level 2 installations are rare installation of eurobalises as definite milestones. Between such milestones the position is estimated and measured relative to the last passed milestone. Initially it was tested, that in difficult adhesive conditions axle revolution transmitters would not give required precision.\nThe European Vital Computer (EVC) also called Eurocab is the heart of local computing capabilities in the driving vehicle. It is connected with external data communication, internal controls to speed regulation of the loco, location sensors and all cab devices of the driver.\n\nThe Euroradio communication unit is compulsory and is used for voice and data communication. Because in ETCS Level 2 all signalling information is exchanged via GSM-R, the equipment is fully doubled with two simultaneous connections to the RBC.\nThe Juridical Recording Unit (JRU) is part of the EVC for recording the last actions of the driver, last parameters of signalling and machine conditions. Such a train event recorder is functionally equivalent to the flight recorder of aircraft.\n\nThe Train Interface Unit (TIU) is the interface of the EVC to the train and/or the locomotive for submitting commands or receiving information.\n\nLineside equipment is the fixed installed part of ETCS installation. According to ETCS Levels the rail related part of installation is decreasing. While in Level 1 sequences with two or more of eurobalises are needed for signal exchange, in Level 2 balises are used for milestone application only. It is replaced in Level 2 by mobile communication and more sophisticated software. In Level 3 even less fixed installation is used. In 2017 first positive tests for satellite positioning were done.\n\nThe Eurobalise is a passive or active antenna device mounted on rail sleepers. Mostly it transmits information to the driving vehicle. It can be arranged in groups to transfer information. There are Fixed and \"Transparent Data Balises\". \"Transparent Data Balises\" are sending changing information from LEU to the trains, e.g. signal indications. \"Fixed Balises\" are programmed for a special information like gradients and speed restrictions.\n\nThe Euroloop is an extension for Eurobalises in ETCS Level 1. It is a special Leaky feeder for transmitting information telegrams to the car.\n\nThe Lineside Electronic Unit (LEU) is the connecting unit between the \"Transparent Data Balises\" with signals or \"Signalling control\" in ETCS Level 1.\n\nA Radio Block Centre is a specialised computing device with specification Safety integrity level 4 (SIL) for generating \"Movement Authorities\" (MA) and transmitting it to trains. It gets information from Signalling control and from the trains in its section. It hosts the specific geographic data of the railway section and receives cryptographic keys from trains passing in. According to conditions the RBC will attend the trains with MA until leaving the section. RBC have defined interfaces to trains, but have no regulated interfaces to Signalling Control and only have national regulation.\n\nThree ETCS test laboratories work together to bring support to the industry:\n\nTo be a reference laboratory ERA is requesting the laboratories to be accredited ISO17025.\n\nGSM is no longer being developed outside of GSM-R, the manufacturers have committed to supplying GSM-R till at least 2030. The ERA is considering what action is needed to smoothly transition to a successor system such as GPRS or Edge.\n\nIn July 2009, the European Commission announced that ETCS is mandatory for all EU-funded projects that include new or upgraded signalling, and GSM-R is required when radio communications are upgraded. Some short stretches in Switzerland, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Sweden, and Belgium are equipped with Level 2 and in operation.\n\nBased on the proposal for 30 TEN-T Priority Axes and Projects during 2003, a cost/benefit analysis was performed by the UIC, presented in December 2003. This identified ten rail corridors covering about 20% of the TEN network that should be given priority in changing to ETCS, and these were included in decision 884/2004/EC by the \"European Commission\".\n\nIn 2005 the UIC combined the axes into the following ETCS Corridors, subject to international development contracts:\nThe Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency (TEN-T EA) publishes ETCS funding announcements showing the progress of trackside equipment and onboard equipment installation.\n\nCorridor A has two routes in Germany – the double track east of the Rhine (rechte Rheinstrecke) will be ready with ETCS in 2018 (Emmerich, Oberhausen, Duisburg, Düsseldorf, Köln-Kalk, Neuwied, Oberlahnstein, Wiesbaden, Darmstadt, Mannheim, Schwetzingen, Karlsruhe, Offenburg, Basel), while the upgrade of the double track west of the Rhine (linke Rheinstrecke) will be postponed.\n\nCorridor F will be developed in accordance with Poland as far as it offers ETCS transport: Frankfurt – Berlin – Magdeburg will be ready in 2012, Hanover to Magdeburg – Wittenberg – Görlitz in 2015. At the other end Aachen to Oberhausen will be ready in 2012, the missing section from Oberhausen to Hanover in 2020. The other two corridors are postponed and Germany chooses to support the equipment of locomotives with STMs to fulfill the requirement of ETCS transport on the corridors.\n\n\nIn Belgium the state railway company SNCB (in French, in Dutch NMBS, in German NGBE) led all activities for introduction of ETCS since the end of the 1990s. The interest resulted from new High Speed Lines (HSL) under construction, the development of the ports at the Atlantic and technically rotting national signalling systems.\n\nin 1999 the council of SNCB decided the opening of HSL 2 with proprietary system TBL 2, but all following lines should use ETCS. To rise the level of security on conventional lines, it was thought to use ETCS L1 for compatibility. But because of high costs for full implementation on rolling stock, it was chosen to select standard components from ETCS for interfacing locos (receiver) and rails (balises) to easy support existing infrastructure. The balises were sending information with reserved national paket type 44, compatible with common signalling. The system was named TBL1+. Later it can be complemented with standardised ETCS information. This is the same migration path as chosen in Italy (SCMT) or Switzerland (Euro-Signum and \"Euro-ZUB\").\n\nIn 2003 the SNCB selected a consortium to supply ETCS for the next high-speed lines with Level 2 and fallback with Level 1.\n\nIt was chosen to supply ETCS L1LS first and later migrate to L1FS. So it was started tendering the renewing of 4000 signals with TBL1+ and L1 including support for 20 years in 2001. In 2006 Siemens was selected for delivery.\n\nFollowing the privatisation of SNCB in 2006 a split-off company Infrabel stepped in to be responsible for the whole state railway infrastructure. It continued the introduction of ETCS railway infrastructure, whereas SNCB was responsible for rolling material. Following some serious accidents (i.e. Halle train collision) caused by missing or malfunctioning protection systems, there was the obvious target to raise the security level in the whole network.\n\nThe first line in ETCS operation was HSL 3 in 2007, which is 56 km (35 mi) long. Because of lack of trains equipped with ETCS, the commercial start of operations was in 2009 with ICE 3 and Thalys trains. The operations started with ETCS SRS 2.2.2 and were later upgraded to 2.3.0.\n\nThe HSL 4 high-speed line was constructed at the same time as \"HSL 3\" and so got the same ETCS equipment. Testing began in 2006 and commercial traffic started about 2008 with locomotive-hauled trains under Level 1. In 2009 commercial high-speed traffic started under ETCS L2 with supported Thalys- and ICE-trains like on \"HSL 3\". A special feature is the first full-speed gapless border crossing under ETCS L2 supervision with HSL Zuid.\n\nIn 2009 all railway lines in Belgium were covered by GSM-R, a foundation of ETCS L2 installation and also useful in L1 operation.\n\nIn 2011 was released a first national \"ETCS–Masterplan\", which was renewed in 2016. It names following four phases of ETCS introduction:\nThe first conventional railway line, which was equipped with ETCS L1, was Brussels–Liège. It started public service in March 2012.\n\nNext was in December 2014 the Liefkenshoek rail link with ETCS L2 in Antwerp, connecting the north and south banks of Scheldt by tunnel for cargo traffic.\n\nInfrabel has budgeted about 332 Million Euro for signalling including ETCS in 2015. After tendering it was given in summer 2015 a long time order to the consortium of Siemens Mobility and Cofely-Fabricom about the installation of ETCS L2 on more than 2200 km of rails. The order includes the delivery of computer based interlockings for the full network until 2025.\n\nThe complete Belgian part of the European north-south Corridor C (port of Antwerp–Mediterranean Sea) with a length of about 430 km is crossable with ETCS L1 since the end of 2015. According to Infrabel was this the longest conventional railway supported with ETCS in Europe.\n\nSummarizing at end of 2015, there were 1225 km mainlines (about a fifth of the network) usable with ETCS L1 or L2.\n\nIn 2016 was given an order for 1362 double deck coaches of Belgium type M7. They are to be delivered between 2018 and 2021 and have a complete ETCS equipment for replacement of older types.\n\n\nIn Croatia, Croatian Railways deployed Level 1 on the Vinkovci–Tovarnik line in 2012.\n\n\n\nGermany intends to use Level 1 only as Limited Supervision – neither Full Supervision nor Euroloops will be installed.\n\nThe first project that was intended to implement ETCS was the Köln–Frankfurt high-speed rail line that had been under construction since 1995. Due to the delays in the ETCS specification a new variant of LZB (CIR ELKE-II) was implemented instead.\n\nThe next planned and first actual implementation was on the Leipzig-Ludwigsfelde main line to Berlin. There, SRS 2.2.2 was tested together with a PZB and LZB mixed installation in conditions of fast and mixed traffic. The section was co-financed by the EU and DB to gain more experience with the ETCS Level 2 mode. Since April 2002 the ETCS section was in daily usage and in March 2003 it was announced that it had reached the same degree of reliability as before using ETCS. Since 6. December 2005 an ETCS train ran at 200 km/h as a part of the normal operation plan on the line north of Leipzig to obtain long-term recordings. As of 2009, the line had been decommissioned for ETCS and is henceforth in use with LZB and PZB. The ETCS equipment seems partly not to be upgradable.\n\nIn 2011, the installation of ETCS L2 (SRS 2.3.0d) was ordered for 14 Mio EUR following the reconstruction and enhancement of the railway line Berlin-Rostock. A first part of 35 km was finished at the end of 2013 between Lalendorf and Kavelstorf.\n\nThe newly built Ebensfeld–Erfurt segment of Nuremberg–Erfurt high-speed railway as well as the Erfurt–Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway and the upgraded Erfurt–Eisenach segment of the Halle–Bebra railway are equipped with ETCS L2. The north-eastern part (Erfurt–Leipzig/Halle) is in commercial use since December 2015 exclusively with ETCS L2 SRS 2.3.0d. The southern part (Ebensfeld–Erfurt) started test running and driver training in the end of August 2017 and regular operation with ETCS L2 in December 2017. Starting in December 2017 there are about 20 high-speed trains per day from Munich to Berlin. ECTS on the western part (Erfurt–Eisenach) was also scheduled for commencing operation in December 2017 but commission was delayed until August 2018.\n\nGermany will start replacing all its PZB and LZB systems in 2015, to be finished by 2027. During 2014 it was planned to use a dual equipment for the four main freight corridors to comply with the EC 913/2010 regulation. Further testing showed that a full ETCS system can increase capacity by 5-10% leading into a new concept \"Zukunft Bahn\" to accelerate the deployment, presented in December 2015. The overall cost reduction of about half a billion euro may be reinvested to complete the switch to ETCS that may take about 15 years. The Deutsche Bahn expects to get further federal funding after the next German federal elections in 2017. In a first step, another 1750 km of existing railway lines are planned to be equipped with ETCS until 2023, focusing on the Rhine-Alpine corridor, the Paris–Southwest Germany corridor and border-crossing lines.\n\nWith Germany pressing for Baseline 3, neighbouring countries like Austria intend to update their vehicle fleet, especially modernizing the GSM-R radio on the trains. One of the last additions to B3R2 was the usage of EDGE in GSM-R. This is already widely deployed in the German rail network (including better frequency filters for the GSM-R radio equipment).\nIn January 2018 the project \"Digitale Schiene\" (digital rail) was unveiled that intended to bring about a transition plan by mid 2018. Deutsche Bahn intends to equip 80% of the rail network with GSM-R by 2030 razing any lineside signals in the process. This will bring about 20% more trains that can be operated in the country. In the process 160,000 signals and 400,000 km of interlocking cables become dispensable. The Digital Rail project came about shortly after the Nuremberg–Erfurt high-speed railway was operational in December 2017 being the first high-speed line to have no lineside signals anymore. After some teething problems with radio reception it settled within the expected range of usability.\n\nPriority is on the 1450 km Rhine Corridor that is about to be equipped with ETCS Level 2. Bringing ETCS to the corridor has been agreed on at the EU level in 2016 as part of the TEN Core network that has expectations set to 2023. The Digital Rail project of 2018 has set the completion date to 2022 for using ETCS Level 2 while Switzerland intends to switch to ETCS Level 2 no later than 2025. Switzerland is expecting an increase in capacity of 30% that will probably come out the same on congested sections along the Rhine.\n\nNew high speed line Athens to Thessaloniki will be the first ETCS Level 1 in Greece. System expected to be ready by the end of 2021\n\nIn Hungary, the Zalacséb–Hodoš line was equipped with Level 1 as a pilot project in 2006.\nThe Budapest–Hegyeshalom Level 1 was launched in 2008, and it was extended to Rajka (GYSEV) in 2015.\nThe Békéscsaba-Lőkösháza line was equipped with Level 1 as an extension of the Level 2 network until further refurbishments will take place.\n\nIn Hungary Level 2 is under construction in the Kelenföld-Székesfehérvár line as a part of a full reconstruction, and planned to be ready before 2015.\nIn Hungary Level 2 is under construction, but due to problems with the installation of GSM-R, all of them are delayed.\nThe Level 2 system is under constructuion in several phases. Currently the Boba-Hodoš, Székesfehérvár station, Székesfehérvár-Ferencváros, Ferencváros-Monor, Monor-Szajol, Szajol-Gyoma and the Gyoma-Békéscsaba sections are under construction.\nThe GYSEV is currently installing Level 2 to the Sopron-Szombathely-Szentgotthárd line.\n\nNational Capital Region Transport Corporation has decided to equip European Train Control System (ETCS) on its Sarai Kale Khan hub in India's First Rapid Rail corridor-Delhi Meerut RRTS Route.\n\nLRT Palembang is equipped with ETCS Level 1 for train protection system and PT. LEN Industri (Persero) provides the trackside fixed-block signalling. The line is slated to open mid-2018.\n\n\nIn Israel ETCS Level 2 will begin replacing PZB in 2020. Three separate tenders were issued in 2016 for this purpose (one contract each was let for track-side infrastructure, rolling-stock integration, and the erection of a GSM-R network). Initial test runs of the system began on 31-March-2020. Concurrent with the implementation of ERTMS are railway electrification works, and an upgrade of the signaling system in the northern portion of Israel Railways' network from relay-based to electronic interlocking. (The southern portion of the network already employs electronic signaling.)\n\nIn Libya, Ansaldo STS was awarded a contract in July 2009 to install Level 2. This has stalled because of civil war.\n\nProcurement for ETCS started in 1999 and the tender was won by Alcatel SEL in July 2002. By 1. March 2005 a small network had been established that was run under ETCS Level 1. The track-side installations were completedin 2014 after spending about 33 million Euro.\n\nThe equipment of the rolling stock did take a bit longer. In early 2016 it became known that the new Class 2200 could not run on Belgium lines. In February 2017 the changeover of Class 3000 was not even started, and Class 4000 had just one prototype installation. However the problems were resolved later with the complete rolling stock having ETCS installations by December 2017.\n\nThe government had pushed for the changeover following the rail accident of Bettembourg on 14. February 2017. With the rolling stock being ready as well, the end date of the usage of the old Memor-II+-systems was set to 31. December 2019. With the decision of 29. January 2018 all trains have to use ETCS by default and it should be continued to use on tracks in Belgium and France as far as possible.\n\n\nETCS equips and will equip the high-speed lines that link Tangier to Kénitra (in service from 2018) and Kénitra to Casablanca \"via\" Rabat (under construction, planned to open in 2020). Other high-speed lines planned to link Casablanca to Agadir and Rabat to Oujda from 2030 will likely be equipped as well.\n\n\n\nIn August 2015 the eastern branch of the Østfold Line becomes first line with ETCS functionality in Norway.\n\nLevel 1 is currently being installed in the Manila LRT Line 1 in preparation for the Cavite extension of the line.\n\nIn Poland, Level 1 was installed in 2011 on the CMK high-speed line between Warsaw and Katowice-Kraków, to allow speeds to be raised from to , and eventually to . The CMK line, which was built in the 1970s, was designed for a top speed of 250 km/h, but was not operated above 160 km/h due to lack of cab signalling. The ETCS signalling on the CMK was certified on 21 November 2013, allowing trains on the CMK to operate at .\n\nIn Poland, Level 2 has been installed as part of a major upgrading of the 346 km Warsaw-Gdańsk-Gdynia line that reduced Warsaw – Gdańsk travel times from five to two hours and 39 minutes in December 2015. Level 2 has been installed on line E30 between Legnica – Węgliniec – Bielawa Dolna on the German border and is being installed on the Warsaw-Łódź line.\n\nIn Slovakia, the system has been deployed as part of the Bratislava–Košice mainline modernisation program, currently between Bratislava (east of Bratislava-Rača station) and Nové Mesto nad Váhom, with the rest of the line to follow. The current implementation is limited to 160 km/h due to limited braking distances between the control segments.\n\n\n\n\nState Railway of Thailand selected ETCS Level 1 for signalling for Bangkok's Suburban Commuter (SRT Red Lines) to be open in early 2021. ETCS Level 1 will also be installed in mainlines extended from Bangkok to Chumphon (Southern Line), Nakhon Sawan (Northern Line), Khon Kaen (Northeastern Line), Si Racha (Eastern Coast Line) and in shortcut line from Chachoengsao to Kaeng Khoi (Shortcut from Eastern Line to North/Northeastern Line) along with Double Tracking Phase I projects and ATP system upgrade of existing double track lines, both scheduled to be completed in 2022.\n\nIn Turkey, Level 2 is installed on the Ankara–Konya high-speed line designed for . The new high-speed line has reduced Ankara-Konya travel times from 10-1/2 hours to 75 minutes.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2214122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214122", "title": "Hirudin", "text": "Hirudin\n\nHirudin is a naturally occurring peptide in the salivary glands of blood-sucking leeches (such as \"Hirudo medicinalis\") that has a blood anticoagulant property. This is fundamental for the leeches’ alimentary habit of hematophagy, since it keeps the blood flowing after the initial phlebotomy performed by the worm on the host’s skin.\n\nDuring his years in Birmingham and Edinburgh, John Berry Haycraft had been actively engaged in research and published papers on the coagulation of blood, and in 1884, he discovered that the leech secreted a powerful anticoagulant, which he named hirudin, although it was not isolated until the 1950s, nor its structure fully determined until 1976. Full length hirudin is made up of 65 amino acids. These amino acids are organized into a compact N-terminal domain containing three disulfide bonds and a C-terminal domain that is completely disordered when the protein is un-complexed in solution. Amino acid residues 1-3 form a parallel beta-strand with residues 214-217 of thrombin, the nitrogen atom of residue 1 making a hydrogen bond with the Ser-195 O gamma atom of the catalytic site. The C-terminal domain makes numerous electrostatic interactions with an anion-binding exosite of thrombin, while the last five residues are in a helical loop that forms many hydrophobic contacts. Natural hirudin contains a mixture of various isoforms of the protein. However, recombinant techniques can be used to produce homogeneous preparations of hirudin.\n\nA key event in the final stages of blood coagulation is the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin by the serine protease enzyme thrombin. Thrombin is produced from prothrombin, by the action of an enzyme, prothrombinase (Factor Xa along with Factor Va as a cofactor), in the final states of coagulation. Fibrin is then cross linked by factor XIII (Fibrin Stabilizing Factor) to form a blood clot. The principal inhibitor of thrombin in normal blood circulation is antithrombin. Similar to antithrombin, the anticoagulant activity of hirudin is based on its ability to inhibit the procoagulant activity of thrombin.\n\nHirudin is the most potent natural inhibitor of thrombin. Unlike antithrombin, hirudin binds to and inhibits only the activated thrombin, with a specific activity on fibrinogen. Therefore, hirudin prevents or dissolves the formation of clots and thrombi (i.e., it has a thrombolytic activity), and has therapeutic value in blood coagulation disorders, in the treatment of skin hematomas and of superficial varicose veins, either as an injectable or a topical application cream. In some aspects, hirudin has advantages over more commonly used anticoagulants and thrombolytics, such as heparin, as it does not interfere with the biological activity of other serum proteins, and can also act on complexed thrombin.\n\nIt is difficult to extract large amounts of hirudin from natural sources, so a method for producing and purifying this protein using recombinant biotechnology has been developed. This has led to the development and marketing of a number of hirudin-based anticoagulant pharmaceutical products, such as lepirudin (Refludan), hirudin derived from \"Hansenula\" (Thrombexx, Extrauma) and desirudin (Revasc/Iprivask). Several other direct thrombin inhibitors are derived chemically from hirudin.\n\n\n"}

He was a son of United Empire Loyalist Major Nicholas Hagerman (1761–1819) J.P., and his wife Anne (1758–1847), daughter of John and Mary (Campbell) Fisher, formerly of Killin.\n\nKit's grandfather, Christopher Hagerman (b.1722), was a Dutch officer in the service of the Prussian Army who had fought for George II of Great Britain at the Battle of Culloden, 1746. Following the Battle of Quebec (1759), he was granted 2,000 acres in Albany, New York. During the American Revolutionary War, Hagerman's father (Nicholas) came under suspicion from the Commission for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies, and went over to the British in 1778.\n\nAfter relocating to Lower Canada, some 200 km. north of Albany, in 1783, on completion of the war, Nicholas Hagerman signed with Captain Alexander White's company of Associated Loyalists. He settled the next year with his servant in the village of Adolphustown, with the help of local notable Peter Van Alstine. Kit Hagerman's uncle, Judge Alexander Fisher (1756–1830) M.P., of Adolphustown, was the father of Helen and Henrietta Fisher, who married the brothers Thomas Kirkpatrick and Judge Stafford Kirkpatrick respectively.\n\nIn 1807, Hagerman began his legal career in the Kingston, Ontario law offices of his father, one of the first appointed barristers in Upper Canada. He served in his father's militia regiment during the War of 1812, becoming the aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Gordon Drummond, who regarded him highly; Hagerman later gained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. Hagerman kept a journal of his war experiences, and this has survived; it is kept in the reserved collection of the City of Toronto Library.\n\nHaving grown up outside John Strachan's inner circle, his military service and association with Drummond gave him the entree he needed for political success. His younger brother Daniel Hagerman followed him into legal and political careers, but died young, at age 27, in 1821.\n\nAfter the war, he was appointed to the lucrative position of Customs Officer at Kingston. He also represented the riding of Kingston, for a total of 14 years, in the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada, as the first parliamentarian from Kingston to this legislative body. Hagerman served from 1820-24 in the Eighth Parliament, but was defeated for re-election in 1824. He then returned from 1831-34 in the 11th Parliament, from 1835-36 in the 12th Parliament, and from 1836-40 in the 13th Parliament.\n\nHe was called to the Bar of Upper Canada in 1815, and became a King's Counsel that same year. In 1829 he was appointed solicitor general for the province, and in 1837 he became attorney general. He was the first Canadian-born attorney general of Upper Canada. As such, he had to deal with the Upper Canada Rebellion in late 1837, which unsuccessfully attempted to overthrown the dominance of the Family Compact.\n\nHagerman was a leading member and advocate of the Family Compact, a staunch conservative, and well known for his loyalty to the Church of England. He was appointed judge for the Court of Queen's Bench in 1841. By this time, Hagerman was one of the most prominent people in Upper Canada, and came into contact with young fellow Kingstonian lawyer Sir John A. Macdonald, also a Conservative, who was then just beginning his own political career. With Hagerman becoming a judge and thus vacating his parliamentary seat, Macdonald won election for Kingston in 1844 into the Province of Canada parliament, and later became Canada's first prime minister in 1867. Young Kingstonian Sir Oliver Mowat, who had apprenticed as a lawyer with Macdonald, was at that time beginning a career which would see him become an Ontario Liberal Party premier for a record 24 years (1872–96).\n\nHagerman was an excellent and skilled orator and conversationalist, and was certainly a controversial figure. He made trouble for himself with intemperate remarks on many occasions, damaging his career prospects. He was a powerfully built man, both bumptious and aggressive, and on one occasion in Kingston horse-whipped the activist Robert Fleming Gourlay, in 1818. As popular as he was within the Family Compact (he was a particular favourite of John Colborne, 1st Baron Seaton), he was thoroughly hated by those outside the circle.\n\nHe was married three times. In 1817 he married Elizabeth, daughter of James Macaulay. In England in 1834, he married Elizabeth Emily, daughter of the British Deputy Secretary at War, William Merry (1762–1855) of Lansdowne Terrace, Cheltenham, by his wife Anne, daughter of Kender Mason of Beel House, Buckinghamshire, the sister of Henry Mason, who married a niece of Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson. Two years later, again in England, he married Caroline, daughter of William George Daniel-Tyssen (1773–1838) of Foley House etc., High Sheriff of Kent, by his wife Amelia, only daughter and heiress of Captain John Amhurst R.N., of East Farleigh Court, Kent.\n\nHagerman died at Toronto in 1847, the father of four children by his first marriage and a daughter by his second.\n\nThere was a township of \"Hagerman\" in Ontario named after him. Township of Hagerman was amalgamated with a few others to form Whitestone, Ontario.\n\nHagerman's portrait hangs as part of the Kingston civic collection in Memorial Hall, Kingston City Hall; it was restored in 2014.\n\nHagerman Street, in the Old Industrial Area of Kingston, is named for him and his family.\n"}

It originally played Off-Off-Broadway in 1966 at the Caffe Cino and then played Off-Broadway, starring newcomer Bernadette Peters, beginning in 1968 for a successful run. The show has enjoyed a London run, a television adaptation and a number of revivals, before its Broadway premiere in October 2015.\n\nThe musical was originally a short sketch, based loosely on the \"Gold Diggers\" movies, written by George Haimsohn, Jim Wise, and Robin Miller. The character of \"Ruby\" was suggested by the Ruby Keeler-type from those early movies. It was lengthened to a 50-minute production, and director Robert Dahdah prepared it for its first staging. After the original actress who was to play \"Ruby\" withdrew during rehearsals, choreographer Don Price recommended newcomer Bernadette Peters for the role. The show opened in May 1966 as \"Dames at Sea, or Golddiggers Afloat\" at the Caffe Cino, a small coffee house/performance space in New York City's Greenwich Village, where it continued for 148 performances. The original Caffe Cino cast featured Peters as Ruby, Joe McGuire as Frank, David Christmas as Dick, Jill Roberts as Joan, Norma Bigtree as Mona and Gary Filsinger as the Director and Captain. Peters was replaced by her sister, Donna Forbes (now DeSeta) during the run.\n\nRetitled simply \"Dames at Sea\", the musical re-opened at the Bouwerie Lane Theatre on December 20, 1968, and transferred to the larger Theater de Lys on April 22, 1969, and closed on May 10, 1970 after a total of 575 performances. Directed and choreographed by Neal Kenyon, the show again featured Peters in the role of Ruby and David Christmas as Dick. The cast also featured Steve Elmore as the Captain, Tamara Long as Mona Kent, Joseph R. Sicari as Lucky, and Sally Stark as Joan. After Peters left the show, the role of \"Ruby\" was played by Loni Ackerman, Bonnie Franklin, Janie Sell, Barbara Sharma, and Pia Zadora.\n\nOn August 27, 1969, the show opened at London's Duchess Theatre, where it ran for 127 performances.\n\nPeters appeared in a regional production at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, New Jersey in early 1973. In July 1973, Peters appeared again as Ruby at the Academy Playhouse, Lake Forest, Illinois. Subsequent revivals have been staged at the Lamb's Theatre in Manhattan (1985) (with Stephen Flaherty playing the piano), the Haymarket Theatre, Leicester, London (1989), and at the theatre where the musical first played off-Broadway, the Bouwerie Lane Theatre, produced by Jean Cocteau Repertory and directed by David Fuller, from September 3, 2004 to November 28, 2004.\n\nThe show began previews on Broadway on September 24, 2015, and officially opened on October 22 at the Helen Hayes Theatre, with direction and choreography by Randy Skinner. A workshop for this production was held in January 2014 with Laura Osnes, Rachel York, Mara Davi, John Bolton, Cary Tedder, and Danny Gardner. The Broadway cast featured John Bolton as The Captain/Hennesey, Mara Davi as Joan, Danny Gardner as Lucky, Eloise Kropp as Ruby, Lesli Margherita as Mona Kent and Cary Tedder as Dick. The show is described as \"a tap-happy gem of a show that celebrates the golden era of movie musicals\". Among the producers are Infinity Theatre Company and Perry Street Theatricals. The show was produced in 2012 by Infinity Theatre Company, Annapolis, Maryland with direction and choreography by Randy Skinner. This production closed on January 3, 2016 after 85 performances and 32 previews.\n\nThe musical is popular for schools and has been produced in many countries.\n\nIn the early 1930s, a Broadway musical is in rehearsal. Mona Kent is its temperamental diva star, Joan a wise-cracking chorus girl, and Hennesy the producer/manager/director. The naive Ruby arrives from Utah, with \"nothing but tap shoes in her suitcase and a prayer in her heart\", determined to be a Broadway star. She promptly faints into the arms of Dick, a sailor and aspiring songwriter (\"It's You\"). Ruby gets a job in the chorus, but Hennesy informs the cast that the theater must be torn down, and they must find another place for the show. Joan and Lucky, another sailor and her former boyfriend, renew their romance (\"Choo-Choo Honeymoon\") while Ruby admits her feelings for Dick (\"The Sailor of My Dreams\"). Dick and Lucky persuade their Captain to volunteer the use of their ship (\"Dames at Sea\"). Mona recognizes the Captain as a former boyfriend (\"The Beguine\"). When Mona kisses Dick, to persuade him to give her one of his songs, Ruby sees and is despondent (\"Raining In My Heart\"). Dick explains the misunderstanding and the couple make up (\"There's Something About You\"). While rehearsing on the actual ship, Mona becomes sea sick (\"The Echo Waltz\"); Ruby steps in to save the show and becomes a star (\"Star Tar\"). The three couples decide to marry (\"Let's Have A Simple Wedding\").\n\nJohn Wilson in \"The New York Times\" pointed out that the music is a mixture of parody, such as the torch song \"That Mister Man\", pastiche (\"Raining in My Heart\"), and the real thing. Wilson wrote that \"The pastiche songs, built around phrases borrowed from or close to actual songs of the genre, usually project an appealing period flavor.\" The joke was that, while spoofing the large, lavish movie musicals, \"Dames at Sea\" did it with a cast of six, 2 pianos and percussion, and a tiny stage.\n\nIn the 2015 Broadway production, director Randy Skinner noted that this was \"...the first time in New York that 'Dames at Sea' will be heard with an orchestra, and the show will have more dancing than ever before with all new dance and vocal arrangements by Rob Berman...' \" This production opened with movie credits projected onto a screen, reproducing exactly the font used by Warner Bros. in the early 1930s. Skinner received a 2016 Tony Award nomination for his choreography.\n\n\n\"*\"In this production, Lucky was called \"Frank.\"\n\nIn his review in \"The New York Times\" of the 1968 production, Clive Barnes wrote \" 'Dames At Sea' is a real winner, a little gem of a musical. The show is wonderfully helped by its cast. The star I suppose is Bernadette Peters as the wholly sweetly silly small-town chorine who taps her way from the bus station to stardom in 24 hours.\" Walter Kerr, in his \"Sunday Times\" feature article, added \"You'll find the show cheerful and ingratiating, I think... Miss Peters is a real find... She is extremely funny, and endearing on top of that.\" The \"Time Magazine\" review noted that the show had \"three thoroughly engaging stars and some of the most ingenious staging currently on or off Broadway. Tamara Long, as the slinky heavy, brandishes a flaming Morganitic torch for her Mister Man, and Sally Stark, as Ruby's peroxided pal, belts a note almost as plangent as the great Merman's. The comic delight of the show, though, is Bernadette Peters, whose Ruby can simultaneously sing and dance up a storm that puts all New York (including Queen Mane of Rumania) at her feet.\"\n\nThe review of the production at the Off-Broadway Bouwerie Lane Theatre (2004) in the \"Gay City News\": Director David Fuller has filled his production with such subtle touches, which make the show seem intriguingly contemporary, and far from the saccharine and serious treatments this chestnut usually receives, he’s restored the true Off-Broadway spirit that used the establishment’s own forms to tweak its foibles. First staged during the Vietnam War era, the musical seems more relevant than ever as it takes precise aim at the sunny outlook that comes from near-psychotic denial of reality. The review praises the cast: \"The cast does a great job... Individually, Kathleen White as Ruby is deliciously comic, with expressions and physical comedies that recall Lucille Ball... Chrysten Peddie as Joan has the tough dame attitude down cold. She’s got a warm presence, is a great dancer and has a strong voice.\"\n\nThe \"USA Today\" reviewer of the 2015 production wrote: \"So why bring this trifle to Broadway, for the first time, 49 years after its downtown premiere? Never mind; just check your cares and pretensions at the door of the Helen Hayes Theatre, ... and prepare to be thoroughly charmed. Through it all, happily, Skinner keeps everyone dancing, providing exuberant tap routines that his cast executes with joyful facility.\"\n\nSteven Suskin, in reviewing for the \"Huffington Post\" wrote: \"The surprise, today, is that the show remains viable; this first Broadway production is impeccably staged and loaded with entertainment, and should delight its target audience ... The songs ... hit all the bases, reminding us of all those wonderful Harry Warren songs; but they are mostly lightweight pastiches, never quite as memorable as the real thing. The show--which was heretofore performed with two pianos and a drummer--is now fully orchestrated.\"\n\nAn adaptation for television starred Ann-Margret as Ruby, Ann Miller as Mona, Anne Meara as Joan, Harvey Evans as Dick, Fred Gwynne as Hennesy and Dick Shawn as the Captain. It was broadcast on the Bell System Family Theater on NBC on November 15, 1971. The cast had extra chorus girls and boys, and there were full production numbers, turning into the very thing it was spoofing. Ann Miller was singled out for praise, especially when \"she was allowed to tap out her brassy impersonation of the temperamental star...\"\n\nThe original off-Broadway Cast Recording was released in 1969 by Columbia Masterworks Records (Columbia OS 3330) and issued on CD by Sony. The Original London Cast Recording is also available on CD.\n\n"}

Her first feature film role in the 1984 action film \"Toy Soldiers\".\n\nGarber's breakout role was wicked Southern belle Ashton Main in the 1985 ABC miniseries \"North and South\", based on the 1982 novel of the same name by John Jakes. It remains the seventh highest rated miniseries in TV history. Garber reprised the role for the 1986 sequel miniseries, \"\", as well as for the 1994 final installment, \"\". She described Ashton:\n\nGarber portrayed the role of Leslie Carrington on the primetime soap \"Dynasty\" from 1987–88. She appeared alone on the cover of \"TV Guide\" for the September 5, 1987 issue (#1797), which included an interview with her. After \"Dynasty\", Garber made guest appearances in various series including \"Quantum Leap\", \"Murder She Wrote\", and \"Midnight Caller\", and appeared in the Australian film \"Beyond My Reach\" (1990). In the 1990s, she landed roles in two daytime soap operas: Suzanne Collier on \"Santa Barbara\" from 1991–92 and Victoria Parker on \"General Hospital\" in 1993. Most recently, Garber portrayed the recurring role of Iris Dumbrowski on the daytime soap opera \"As the World Turns\" in 2005, returning from November 2006-10.\n\nIn 2012, Garber appeared as Elizabeth Archer in the series finale of the teen drama web series \"Miss Behave\".

She did some modeling from ages 4 to 13, and always wanted to be a performer. Garber told \"TV Guide\" in 1987 that she chose acting over singing because \"I was too nervous to sing in front of people—it meant showing more of myself than acting. If you're on stage singing and people don't like it, that's too much rejection.\" She later moved to New York, where her casual drug use became what she called \"a huge problem\". She overcame the addiction before being cast in \"North and South\".\n\nGarber met her first husband, screenwriter Christopher \"Chris\" Hager, when he was working as a grip on the set of \"North and South: Book II\" in 1985. She and Hager are the parents of actress and singer Molly E. Hager (b. 1986). That union ended in divorce in 1989. Her second marriage, to Frank Michael Howson (July 21, 2001 – June 24, 2002), also ended in divorce. In 2013, Garber married director William Roudebush, her former high school drama teacher that she had once been engaged to when she was age 17.\n\nGarber and her sister Lisa Garber Rubenstein began a business handmaking all-natural soap in various scents and styles, known as SistersAlchemy.\n"}

He served as a member of Toronto City Council and Metropolitan Toronto Council for the Metro ward of East Toronto from 1985 to 1997, as Commissioner and Chair of the TTC from 1991 until 1998 and as supervisor of the Toronto District School Board for the 2002–03 and 2003–04 school years.\n\nChristie was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of noted Macedonian-Canadian community activist, Alex Christie, and his wife Eleanor. He was educated at Wilfrid Laurier University and the University of Toronto, where he studied under Dr. Marshall McLuhan.\n\nHe worked as a ministerial assistant at the Ontario Secretariat for Social Development during the Bill Davis government. At the age of twenty-nine he ran for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1981 provincial election as a Progressive Conservative candidate in Beaches—Woodbine, and lost to New Democrat Marion Bryden by a tiny margin of 324 votes. Christie campaigned unsuccessfully against Bryden again in the 1985 election.\n\nIn November 1985, at age thirty-three, Christie was elected to the Toronto City Council as an alderman for Ward 9, in a section of Toronto then known as The Beaches. On his first day as a member of Council his colleagues elected him Chair of the City Services (Works) Committee and he was instrumental in the effort to close the Commissioners Street Incinerator. Christie also chaired the Neighbourhoods (Parks, Fire, Buildings) Committee. As chair of the Daycare Grants Committee, he was noted for his efforts resulting in better wages for early childhood educators. In 1987, Mr. Christie was selected as one of \"Toronto's Top 25 Under 40\" by the Globe and Mail.\n\nIn 1988, he was elected to the Metropolitan Toronto Council. Again, on his first day at Council he was elected to serve as Chair of the Metro Works Committee, and was a member of the Greater Toronto Area Solid Waste Interim Steering Committee. Christie helped manage the introduction of the blue box and subjected the Ashbridge's Bay Main Treatment Plant to a full environmental assessment. Christie was returned to the Metro Council without opposition in 1991 and handily re-elected in 1994, receiving more votes than any Metro candidate that year. From 1991, he served as a Toronto Transit Commissioner, becoming its chair in 1994. Christie opened the extension of the Spadina Subway to Downsview and led the TTC effort that resulted in the construction of the Sheppard Avenue subway line. He initiated the TTC Premium Express services through his efforts to create the first - the Beach Express in 1995. He served as a Board Member of Toronto East General Hospital, The Riverdale Hospital, O'Keefe/Hummingbird now the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts, the Toronto Zoo, the City of Toronto Non-Profit Housing Corporation (Cityhome) and a variety of community agencies.\n\nChristie sought election to the newly amalgamated City of Toronto Council in November 1997, and was narrowly defeated by Tom Jakobek and Sandra Bussin in the two-member ward. He then became the chief executive of the Ontario Charity Gaming Operators' Association which achieved approvals for several small casinos. At Christie's suggestion the unpopular term 'video lottery terminal' was eliminated from the Ontario casino industry and thereafter replaced with 'slots'. Christie also operated an independent government relations consulting business.\n\nIn 2001–2002 Christie chaired the campaign of Ontario Labour Minister Chris Stockwell, who sought to be Leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservatives and Premier of Ontario.\n\nIn August 2002, Christie was appointed by the government of Ontario of Ernie Eves to serve as supervisor of the Toronto District School Board, with sole authority for all financial and administrative functions of the Board. The school system is Canada's largest, with over 550 schools and 300,000 full- and part-time students. His appointment allowed Christie to supersede the authority of elected school trustees. Among the Trustees supervised were future Premier of Ontario Kathleen Wynne, future Ontario Cabinet Minister Donna Cansfield and future Toronto City Councillors Paula Fletcher and Shelley Carroll. The provincial government argued that Christie's appointment was necessary, as the TDSB had not submitted a budget to the Ontario Minister of Education as legally required. Representatives of the TDSB claimed that they could not find the necessary operating expenses for the year, given provincial regulations which prohibited deficit spending. TDSB chair Donna Cansfield was perceived to be supportive of Christie's initiatives, so trustee Shelley Carroll waged a campaign to replace Cansfield. Unable to generate majority support, Carroll then served with Cansfield as TDSB co-chair.\n\nChristie balanced the TDSB's budget through a dramatic spending reduction of $90 million. Under his watch, the TDSB eliminated many secretarial positions, phased out school-community advisors and matrons, reduced the number of vice-principals, cut outdoor education and adult education, and re-evaluated the position of social workers in the system. Using provincial funds he severed the employment of 700 people who had 'no position of record' with the Board. Christie's staff reports were not made public, and some critics argued that there were no adequate checks or balances on his authority. Christie argued that his reductions had no implications for classroom education.\n\nHis tenure as supervisor ended with the election of Dalton McGuinty's Liberal Party in the 2003 provincial election. The McGuinty government retained most of Christie's initiatives, including the staff reductions.\n\nChristie subsequently returned to his business, M.L. Christie Consulting Ltd., specializing in municipal and provincial government relations. He is registered with the City of Toronto Lobbyist Registry. Christie has represented many companies in the media and transportation sectors. He also served as a director of Grey Island Systems International Inc., (and its subsidiary, NextBus) a GPS services company (TSX V: GIS). Subsequent to the acquisition of Grey Island by Webtech Wireless Inc. (TSX: WEW), Christie joined the board of that company. In 2016, Mr. Christie was elected to the Board of Directors and Chairman of BeWhere Holdings Inc., (TSX Venture, BEW.V). Also in 2016, Christie became a member of the board of directors of the Toronto Foundation for Student Success and Canadian Macedonian Place.\n\nChristie is married to Mary (Purves) Christie (Beach Citizen of the Year, 2009) and has two children, Molly and Cameron.\n"}

{"id": "2214175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214175", "title": "Dalhousie, New Brunswick", "text": "Dalhousie, New Brunswick\n\nDalhousie ( ) is a Canadian town located in Restigouche County, New Brunswick.\n\nDalhousie is the shire town of Restigouche County and dates European settlement to 1800. The Town of Dalhousie has been through some very distinct periods between its founding in 1825 and today. Prior to 1825, few showed much interest in the northern part of the province, but in that year the Great Miramichi Fire raged through central New Brunswick and into Maine, destroying the forests that were the mainstay of the province's economy. Lumbermen looked north to the great pine stands of the Nipisiguit and the Restigouche.\n\nDalhousie, located at the mouth of the Restigouche, began to grow. Soon it was a booming town and became the Shiretown of the newly created Restigouche County. Lumber and fishing were the main interests, although agriculture was more important in the early days than it is today.\n\nDalhousie was the leading town of the area until the arrival of the railway following confederation. With steep hills at its back, the Intercolonial Railway (ICR) bypassed the town while its nearby rival, Campbellton, surged ahead. That would be the situation until the late 1920s, when Dalhousie was picked as the site of a giant paper mill. The International Paper Company built what was then one of the largest newsprint mills in the world and the town changed forever. From 1929 on, the mill would dominate life in Dalhousie. For a time, the deepwater port attracted ships to move ore from the Bathurst Mining Camp deposits (e.g. Heath Steele Mines) to various offshore smelters.\nParents of some of our older citizens would tell their children that, in some ways, it was a better town before the mill. Certainly the mill is one of the town's most imposing features. It occupies much of one side of the main street, blocking access to and even views of the shore. Dalhousie has been called \"a waterfront town without a waterfront.\" The mill also meant that the town had a high average income. It brought a new and different kind of prosperity. Still, Dalhousie was in the situation of many one-industry towns – dependent on the success of that one main sector of its economy.\nThe hilly town site was first laid out in 1826 with the first settlement established by Scottish settlers in 1827. It was named after the 9th Earl of Dalhousie, who was then the governor of both Upper Canada and Lower Canada. Some Acadians displaced in the Great Upheaval also settled in Dalhousie, and to this day there is a very close balance between anglophones and francophones. Many of the present residents can trace ancestry back to the original European settlers in the region. The Eel River Bar First Nation, adjacent to Dalhousie, is home to many Micmac natives, who were the original residents of the region.\n\nDalhousie was officially incorporated in 1905. It has been, in the past, referred to as Papertown.\n\nDalhousie is the most northern point in New Brunswick, and thus is in the Maritime provinces. It is situated in the Restigouche River valley at the tongue of the river where it discharges into Chaleur Bay. The valley lies in a hilly region, part of the Appalachian mountain range, although the Dalhousie town site is situated on a hill side several decameters above sea level with some development to its south on a low ridge of approximately 260 metres elevation. The town is surrounded by salt and fresh water bodies, which are home to many species of wildlife, unique birds, and fish. The area is rich in natural resources.\n\nDalhousie faces Miguasha, Quebec on the Gaspé Peninsula to the north. The city of Campbellton lies upriver to the west and the city of Bathurst is approximately southeast along the shore of Chaleur Bay. There are no major centres south of Dalhousie as this is the undeveloped and heavily forested geographic centre of the province.\n\nUntil 31 January 2008, the economy was dominated by the forestry industry, namely a large pulp and paper mill spanning the waterfront along the Restigouche River. This mill was built to produce newsprint by the New Brunswick International Paper Co. in 1928 (a subsidiary of International Paper). Dalhousie was prosperous for many decades due to the mill and the employment opportunities it created.\n\nThe mill underwent ownership changes in 1980, when Oji Paper Co. Ltd. and Mitsui & Co. of Japan purchased 33 per cent of the mill. They grouped it under the name Canadian International Paper. In 1991, it was purchased by Canadian Pacific Limited, who grouped it under their Canadian Pacific Forest Products subsidiary. The mill changed hands again in 1994, when CPFP changed to become Avenor Inc.. In 1998 Bowater purchased the Dalhousie newsprint mill, and it was renamed \"Bowater Maritimes Inc.\".\n\nThe 2007 merger of Bowater and Abitibi Consolidated resulted in the decision by the newly merged company to announce the closure of the Dalhousie newsprint mill on 29 November 2007 due to apparent market conditions. The mill, which had produced 640 tonnes of newsprint per day for shipment by rail, truck and ship to domestic and international markets, was officially closed on 31 January 2008. Consequently, the economy of the town of Dalhousie is facing uncertainty during the post-industrial adjustment. Due to the closure of this mill, hundreds were left without work in the local economy and some were forced to move. The mill has since been completely demolished.\n\nFollowing the closure of the pulp and paper mill in 2008, Pioneer Chemicals closed a processing plant on the western edge of the town. As a result of the closures of these industries, the New Brunswick East Coast Railway and its subsequent owner CN Rail announced that it was declaring the railway spur into the town surplus. However, a deal was struck between CN and the Port of Dalhousie for this section of line to remain open under a leasing agreement in November 2011.\n\nThe only industry that remained was the generating station, but it was decommissioned in 2012 and demolished in 2015 after one more failed attempt.\n\nWhile there are several smaller employers, the largest employer in the town currently is the Dalhousie Nursing Home.\n\nThe town benefits from its geography by having a deep sea port, which is ice-free year round. The administration of the port was privatised in 2006, as the result of the federal government's divestiture programme.\nThe port is located on the south shore of the Bay of Chaleur at the mouth of the Restigouche River, and includes 98 acres (39.66 hectares) of land, 494 acres (200 hectares) of \"waterlot,\" and two cargo facilities—East Bay Marine Terminal, whose chief cargo is paper, and the West Wharf, which imports petroleum and coal and exports ore concentrates. Berth depths range from 9.7 to 10.3 meters (31.8 to 33.8 feet). The port is located adjacent to the now-demolished pulp and paper mill. The east wharf can handle 340m vessels with maximum draught at low tide of 9.1m, and has indoor storage facilities of 1ha, while the west wharf handles vessels of up to 355m with draught 10.3m.\n\nIt is also served by the New Brunswick East Coast Railway and is located on the Highway 11 arterial highway. Via Rail Canada provides passenger train service three days per week with stops at Charlo immediately east of the town and in Campbellton to the west.\n\nThe Charlo Airport is located several kilometres east of the town for private and charter service with scheduled air service available at the Bathurst Airport.\n\nDalhousie has two elementary schools (Académie Notre-Dame and L.E.

He graduated from Saint Louis University in 1976 with two undergraduate degrees, a B.A. in Urban Affairs and a B.A. in Political Science. He received his Juris Doctor from Saint Louis University School of Law in 1979. While a student at Saint Louis University, Bosley was president of the Black Student Alliance and the Black-American Law Students Association, organizations that were formed during the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nUpon graduation from law school, Bosley was staff attorney for Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, specializing in Consumer Affairs and Utility Companies.

{"id": "2214225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214225", "title": "Adoration", "text": "Adoration\n\nAdoration is respect, reverence, strong admiration or devotion in a certain person, place, or thing. The term comes from the Latin \"adōrātiō\", meaning \"to give homage or worship to someone or something\".\n\nIn classical Rome, adoration was primarily an act of homage or worship, which, among the Romans, was performed by raising the hand to the mouth, kissing it and then waving it in the direction of the adored object. The devotee had his head covered, and after the act turned himself round from left to right. Sometimes he kissed the feet or knees of the images of the gods themselves, and Saturn and Hercules were adored with the head bare. By a natural transition the homage, at first paid to divine beings alone, came to be paid to monarchs. Thus the Greek and Roman emperors were adored by bowing or kneeling, laying hold of the imperial robe, and presently withdrawing the hand and pressing it to the lips, or by putting the royal robe itself to the lips.\n\nIn Eastern countries, adoration has been performed in an attitude still more lowly. The Persian method, introduced by Cyrus the Great, was to kiss the knee and fall on the face at the prince's feet, striking the earth with the forehead and kissing the ground. This striking of the earth with the forehead, usually a fixed number of times, was a form of adoration sometimes paid to Eastern potentates.\n\nThe Jews kissed in homage, as did other groups mentioned in the Old Testament. Thus in 1 Kings 19:18, God is made to say, \"Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.\" And in Psalms 2:12, \"Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way\". (See also Hosea 13:2.)\n\nIn Western Europe, the ceremony of kissing the sovereign's hand, and some other acts which are performed while kneeling, may be described as forms of adoration.\n\nAdoration may take the form of Eucharistic adoration. Pope Benedict XVI reflected on this: \"Only in adoration can profound and true acceptance develop. And it is precisely this personal act of encounter with the Lord that develops the social mission which is contained in the Eucharist and desires to break down barriers, not only the barriers between the Lord and us but also and above all those that separate us from one another\". In a similar vein Pope Francis wrote: \"The perpetual adoration of the Eucharist [is] growing at every level of ecclesial life. Even so, we must reject the temptation to offer a privatized and individualistic spirituality which ill accords with the demands of charity\" \"(Evangelii gaudium,\" 262), Some churches contain \"adoration chapels\" in which the Eucharist is continuously on display that the faithful may observe their faith through it. \"The Cure of Ars would spend hours in front of the Blessed Sacrament. When people would ask him what he would do or say during those hours, he would say: 'He looks at me, and I look at him.'\"\n\n"}

Its contributing currents are the Loop Current and the Antilles Current. The current was discovered by Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León in 1513.\n\nThe Florida Current results from the movement of water pushed from the Atlantic into the Caribbean Sea by the rotation of the Earth (which exerts a greater force at the equator). The water piles up along Central America and flows northward through the Yucatán Channel into the Gulf of Mexico. The water is heated in the Gulf and forced out through the Florida Straits, between the Florida Keys and Cuba and flows northward along the east coast of the United States. The Florida Current is often referred to imprecisely as the Gulf Stream. In fact, the Florida Current joins the Gulf Stream off the east coast of Florida.\n\nThe Florida Current has an estimated mean transport of 30 Sv, varying seasonally and interannually by as much as 10 Sv. The volume transport increases as it flows farther north, reaching its maximum transport of 85 Sv near Cape Hatteras.\n\nThe water reaches a velocity of 1.8 m/s or 3.6 knots.\n\nThe Florida current reaches a maximum transport in July and a minimum transport in October, with a subsequent secondary maximum and minimum occurring in January and April, respectively. Shorter variations in the transport may last between 2 and 20 days depending on wind current patterns, and are shortest during the summer months.\n\nLike transport, the spatial magnitude of the current increases along its course. At 27°N, it has a width of 80 km; it gradually increases from 120 km at 29°N to 145 km where it flows into the Gulf Stream at 73°W.\n\n\n"}

Improved graphics mean the characters themselves more closely resemble their film counterparts than in previous games. Gameplay in the \"Goblet of Fire\" is much more action-oriented, which is a change from the puzzle and adventure elements found in previous games of the series.\n\nThe game is split up into particular levels, rather than freeroaming around Hogwarts castle like in earlier games. Levels are played from parts of the novel the game is based on, with levels ranging from the Quidditch World cup, the Prefect's bathroom, and the Herbology greenhouses; which can be entered from the in game \"pensieve\". The game also features modes outside of combat, including broomstick flying, and underwater swimming.\n\nIn a first for the series, players can play the game with friends, and can combine their magic and spells to make them more powerful. Players can also capture moving beans using \"Accio\" and increase their power with collectors, creature, and character cards. The game is divided into several non-consecutive levels, some of which are locked at the beginning of the game until the player collects enough Triwizard Shields to unlock it.\n\nJust like the previous \"Harry Potter\" game titles, \"Goblet of Fire\" has received \"mixed\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator \"Metacritic\". In Japan, where the GameCube and Nintendo DS were ported on November 26, 2005, \"Famitsu\" gave it a combined score of 28 out of 40 for the DS version; and 27 out of 40 for the GameCube version. \"Famitsu Cube + Advance\" gave both the DS and GameCube versions a score of 27 out of 40.\n\n\"Detroit Free Press\" gave the GameCube version all four stars and said, \"This is a masterful video game because it can be enjoyed on many levels. Younger players can simply explore this graphically rich \"Harry Potter\" world and succeed. Older players will enjoy manipulating the magic by choosing spells and skills and casting magic together with friends.\" However, \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" gave the game three stars out of five and stated that its highlight \"is a brief but thrilling broomstick chase against a fire-breathing dragon. An underwater interlude is less successful, although it provides variety.\"\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version of \"The Goblet of Fire\" received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n"}

A successful attempt is worth three points, in contrast to the two points awarded for field goals made within the three-point line and the one point for each made free throw. \n\nThe distance from the basket to the three-point line varies by competition level: in the National Basketball Association (NBA) the arc is from the center of the basket; in FIBA, the WNBA, and men's play in both the NCAA (all divisions) and NAIA, the arc is ; and in NCAA and NAIA women's play, the arc is . The (W)NBA, FIBA, and U.S. college men's three-point lines become parallel to each sideline at the points where each arc is a specified distance from the sideline. In both the NBA and WNBA, this distance is from the sideline; as a result, the distance from the center of the basket gradually decreases to a minimum of . FIBA specifies the arc's minimum distance from the sideline as , resulting in a minimum distance from the center of the basket of . The NCAA and NAIA men's arc is the same distance from the center of the basket as the FIBA arc, but is from each sideline because the North American court (used by the NAIA, NCAA, NBA, and WNBA) is slightly wider than the FIBA court. In all NCAA or NAIA women's play, the arc is continuous for 180° around the basket. There are more variations (see main article).\n\nIn 3x3, a FIBA-sanctioned variant of the half-court 3-on-3 game, the same line exists, but shots from behind it are only worth 2 points with all other shots worth 1 point.\n\nThe three-point line was first tested at the collegiate level in 1945, with a 21-foot line, in a game between Columbia and Fordham, but it was not kept as a rule. There was another one-game experiment in 1958, this time with a 23-foot line, in a game between St. Francis (NY) and Siena. In 1961, Boston University and Dartmouth played one game with an experimental rule that counted all field goals as three points. In 1962, the St. Francis (NY) head coach, Daniel Lynch, once again made the suggestion of a 3pt line to the New York Basketball Writers Association.\n\nAt the direction of Abe Saperstein, the American Basketball League became the first basketball league to institute the rule in 1961. As commissioner of the new league, Saperstein wanted to add excitement to the game and distinguish the league from the bigger NBA. He hoped the three-pointer would become basketball's equivalent of the home run. “We must have a weapon,” Saperstein said, “and this is ours.”\n\nTo determine the distance the new shot line should be from the basket, Saperstein and longtime DePaul University coach Ray Meyer went onto a court one day with tape and selected 25 feet as the right length. “They just arbitrarily drew lines,” his son Jerry Saperstein said. “There’s really no scientific basis. Just two Hall of Fame coaches getting together and saying: ‘Where would we like to see the line?’” Not long after, in June 1961, Saperstein was traveling when the other seven ABL owners voted 4-3 to officially shorten the line, to 22 feet. Saperstein, who had significant power in the league as owner of the popular Globetrotters, disagreed with this and simply ignored the ruling. Games continued with the shot. Saperstein eventually acknowledged there was one problem with the 25-foot arc and solved it by adding a 22-foot line in the corners. “It made for interesting possibilities,” he wrote.\n\nAfter the ABL shut down in 1963, the three-point shot was adopted by the Eastern Professional Basketball League in its 1963–64 season. It was also popularized by the American Basketball Association (ABA), which introduced it in its inaugural 1967–68 ABA commissioner George Mikan stated that the three-pointer \"would give the smaller player a chance to score and open up the defense to make the game more enjoyable for the fans\". During the 1970s, the ABA used the three-point shot, along with the slam dunk, as a marketing tool to compete with the NBA. Its ninth and final season concluded in the spring \nThree years later in June 1979, the NBA adopted the three-point line for a one-year trial for the despite the view of many that it was a gimmick. Chris Ford of the Boston Celtics is credited with making the first three-point shot in NBA history on October 12, 1979. The season opener at Boston Garden was more remarkable for the debut of Larry Bird (and two new Rick Barry of the Houston Rockets, in his final season, also made one in the same game, and Kevin Grevey of the Washington Bullets made one that Friday night \n\nThe sport's international governing body, FIBA, introduced the three-point line in 1984, and it made its Olympic debut in 1988 in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nThe NCAA's Southern Conference became the first collegiate conference to use the three-point rule, adopting a line for the 1980–81 season. Ronnie Carr of Western Carolina was the first to score a three-point field goal in college basketball history on November 29, 1980. Over the following five years, NCAA conferences differed in their use of the rule and distance required for a three-pointer. The line was as close as in the Atlantic Coast Conference, and as far away as in the \n\nUsed only in conference play for several years, it was adopted by the NCAA in April 1986 for the 1986–87 season at and was first used in the NCAA Tournament in March 1987. The NCAA adopted the three-pointer in women's basketball on an experimental basis for that season at the same distance, and made its use mandatory beginning In 2007, the NCAA lengthened the men's distance by a foot to , effective with the season, and the women's line was moved to match the men's in 2011–12. American high schools, along with elementary and middle schools, adopted a line nationally in 1987, a year after the NCAA. The NCAA experimented with the FIBA three-point line distance in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) then adopted that distance for all men's play with a phased conversion that began with Division I in the 2019–20 season. The NAIA and other American associations also adopted the new NCAA distance for their respective men's play. In that same 2019–20 season, the NCAA planned to experiment with the FIBA arc in women's postseason events other than the NCAA championships in each division, most notably the Women's National Invitation Tournament and Women's Basketball Invitational; these events were ultimately scrapped due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor three seasons beginning in 1994–95, the NBA attempted to address decreased scoring by shortening the distance of the line from ( at the corners) to a uniform around the basket. From the 1997–98 season on, the NBA reverted the line to its original distance of ( at the corners, with a 3-inch differential). Ray Allen is the NBA all-time leader in career three-pointers with 2,973.\n\nIn 2008, FIBA announced that the distance would be increased by to , with the change being phased in beginning in October 2010. In December 2012, the WNBA announced that it would use the FIBA distance, starting in 2013; by 2017, the distance at the corners was lengthened to match the NBA. The NBA has discussed adding a four-point line, according to president Rod Thorn.\n\nIn the NBA, three-point field goals became increasingly more frequent along the years, especially by mid-2015 onward. The increase in latter years has been attributed to NBA player Stephen Curry, who is credited with revolutionizing the game by inspiring teams to regularly employ the three-point shot as part of their winning strategy. \n\nA three-point line consists of an arc at a set radius measured from the point on the floor directly below the center of the basket, and two parallel lines equidistant from each sideline extending from the nearest end line to the point at which they intersect the arc. In the (W)NBA, NCAA or NAIA men's and FIBA standards, the arc spans the width of the court until it is a specified minimum distance from each sideline. The three-point line then becomes parallel to the sidelines from those points to the baseline. The unusual formation of the three-point line at these levels allows players some space from which to attempt a three-point shot at the corners of the court; the arc would be less than from each sideline at the corners if it was a continuous arc. In the NAIA or NCAA women's and American high school standards, the arc spans 180° around the basket, then becomes parallel to the sidelines from the plane of the basket center to the baseline ( in college, in high schools). \nThe distance of the three-point line to the center of the hoop varies by level:\n\nThe high school corner minimum is taken as a requirement for newer high school gymnasiums and fieldhouses built in the three-point era. Courts built in older eras before state high school sanctioning bodies issued rules regarding court sizes have narrower markings, requiring home court ground rules where there is less space behind the three-point arc, the space on the sides of the arc can barely accommodate the shooter's feet due to lack of room, or it may be marked closer than the suggested minimum.\n\nA player's feet must be completely behind the three-point line at the time of the shot or jump in order to make a three-point attempt; if the player's feet are on or in front of the line, it is a two-point attempt. A player is allowed to jump from outside the line and land inside the line to make a three-point attempt, as long as the ball is released in mid-air.\n\nAn official raises his/her arm with three fingers extended to signal the shot attempt. If the attempt is successful, he/she raises his/her other arm with all fingers fully extended in manner similar to a football official signifying successful field goal to indicate the three-point goal. The official must recognize it for it to count as three points. Instant replay has sometimes been used, depending on league rules. The (W)NBA, FIBA and the NCAA specifically allow replay for this purpose. In (W)NBA & FIBA games, video replay does not have to occur immediately following a shot; play can continue and the officials can adjust the scoring later in the game, after reviewing the video. However, in late game situations, play may be paused pending a review.\n\nIf a shooter is fouled while attempting a three-pointer and subsequently misses the shot, the shooter is awarded three free-throw attempts. If a player completes a three-pointer while being fouled, the player is awarded one free-throw for a possible 4-point play. Conceivably, if a player completed a three-pointer while being fouled, and that foul was ruled as either a Flagrant 1 or a Flagrant 2 foul, the player would be awarded two free throws for a possible 5-point play.\n\nMajor League Lacrosse features a two-point line which forms a arc around the front of the goal. Shots taken from behind this line count for two points, as opposed to the standard one point.\n\nIn gridiron football, a standard field goal is worth three points; various professional and semi-pro leagues have experimented with four-point field goals. NFL Europe and the Stars Football League adopted a rule similar to basketball's three-point line in which an additional point was awarded for longer field goals; in both leagues any field goal of or more was worth four points. The Arena Football League awarded four points for any successful drop kicked field goal (like the three-point shot, the drop kick is more challenging than a standard place kick, as the bounce of the ball makes a kick less predictable, and arena football also uses narrower goal posts for all kicks than the outdoor game does).\n\nDuring the existence of the World Hockey Association in the 1970s, there were proposals for two-point hockey goals for shots taken beyond an established distance (one proposal was a 44-foot (13.4m) arc, which would have intersected the faceoff circles), but this proposal gained little support and faded after the WHA merged with the NHL. It was widely believed that long-distance shots in hockey had little direct relation to skill (usually resulting more from goalies' vision being screened or obscured), plus with the lower scoring intrinsic to the sport a two-point goal was seen as disruptive of the structure of the game.\n\nThe Super Goal is a similar concept in Australian rules football, in which a arc determines the value of a goal; within the arc, it is the usual 6 points, but 9 points are scored for a \"super goal\" scored from outside the arc. To date the super goal is only used in pre-season games and not in the season proper.\n\nThe National Professional Soccer League II, which awarded two points for all goals except those on the power play, also used a three-point line, drawn from the goal. It has since been adopted by some other indoor soccer leagues.\n\n\n"}

He was one of the \"Little Masters\", the group of German artists making small old master prints in the generation after Albrecht Dürer.\n\nPainter, printmaker and goldsmith active in a Westphalia milieu. Born in Paderborn. His real name was Trippenmecker, which in Westphalian dialect means a clog-maker. It is not known where Aldegrever was taught. He probably worked in a workshop of one of the Soest goldsmiths. His early works show a strong Westphalian influence. Aldegrever made a journey to the Netherlands, where he became acquainted with works of Joos van Cleve, Barendt van Orley, Lucas van Leyden and Jacob Cornelisz.\n\nAround 1525 he moved to Soest, where a year later he painted the wings and predella of the Mary altar for the church of St. Peter. His signature and symbolic clog show that he was still using his father's name.\n\nHis first engravings appeared in 1527. They were signed with a monogram \"AG\", resembling closely that of Albrecht Dürer. In 1531, influenced by surrounding religious fervour, he became a Lutheran. Because of lack of church commissions he devoted most of his time to portrait painting and printmaking. Aldegrever's some 290 engravings and woodcuts, chiefly from his own designs, are delicate and minute, though somewhat hard in style, and entitle him to a place in the front rank of the so-called \"Little Masters\": Barthel Beham, his brother Hans Sebald Beham, and Georg Pencz, with whom he is often compared. Like them, he was also a skilled ornament designer. From the close resemblance of his style to that of Albrecht Dürer he has also sometimes been called the \"Albert of Westphalia\".\n\nAbout a third of his prints were ornamental engravings; they were used as models by artists and craftsmen well into the seventeenth century.\n\nAldegrever, who actively supported the Reformation, executed portraits of Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon. Although he chose the Lutheran Church, he had friends among the Anabaptists. He was commissioned by the bishop of Münster in 1535–36 to engrave portraits of Anabaptist leaders Jan van Leyden and Bernhard Knipperdolling, although they were already imprisoned, and only caricatures of them circulated. In the cycle \"Power of Death\", done under visible influence of Hans Holbein, he criticizes the vices of the Catholic Church.\n\nAldegrever was interested also in folk subjects. In 1538 and 1551 two series of prints depicting marriage dances were made. An important part of his oeuvre are prints on mythological subjects, the \"Deeds of Hercules\" being one of the best examples.\n\nOnly two paintings are firmly attributed to him: the wings and predella of the \"Marienaltar\" (c. 1525-6) in the Wiesenkirche in Soest, and a portrait of Graf Phillip von Waldeck (1837) in Schloss Aroldsen.\n\n\n"}

This independence has not been recognized by any country or international organization. It was under the control of different armed movements such as the Ansar Dine and MNLA until January 2013, when French forces liberated the region. The Region's administrative capital is the town of Kidal.\n\nThe region is bordered on the west by Tomboctou Region, to the south by Gao Region, to the east by Niger and to the north by Algeria.\n\nKidal has a desert climate with day-time temperatures that reach as high as 45 °C (113 °F).\n\nIn 2009 the region had a population of 67,638. In addition 30% of its population, mostly Tuareg and Songhai were displaced to North Africa during the 1990s.\n\nThe largest towns of the region are Kidal, Tessalit, and Aguel'hoc.\n\nThe primary trades of Kidal Region include livestock breeding, craft-making, and commerce.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, with later boundary increases in 1997 and 2008. In addition to its historic value, Woodbridge is also notable for being an intact neighborhood of turn-of-the-century homes within walking or biking distance of Detroit's Downtown, Midtown, New Center, and Corktown neighborhoods.\n\nThe district as recognized by the National Register of Historic Places was originally bounded by Trumbull Street, Calumet Street, Gibson Street, Grand River Avenue, Rosa Parks Boulevard, West Warren Avenue, Wabash Street, Railroad Tracks, and the Edsel Ford Freeway. The boundaries of the District were increased twice: in 1997, 4304-14 Trumbull Street (private residences) and 3800 Grand River Avenue were added to the district, and in 2008 the southeast corner of Trumbull Street and Warren Avenue (Saint Dominic Roman Catholic Church) was added.\n\nMost structures in the district are located on north-south streets. The irregularly-shaped district includes structure at 3800 Grand River Avenue (between Avery Street and Commonwealth Street), and structures within the following boundaries:\n\nWoodbridge is an intact neighborhood of architecturally significant buildings and has had an important effect on the history of Detroit. The neighborhood, dating to the Victorian era, has largely escaped the redevelopment efforts that have obliterated many of Detroit's other historic areas. It is named for William Woodbridge, governor of Michigan in 1840–1, who owned a large farm on which much of the neighborhood was subsequently built.\n\nMost of the structures within the neighborhood were built after 1870, beginning with modest cottages. Larger structures were built later, including the James Scripps house (now demolished and turned into a city park), built in 1879. The Eighth Precinct Police Station, built in 1901, was architecturally designed to blend in with the lavish upper-class homes in the neighborhood. As the automotive industry boomed, there was an increased demand for housing in the city of Detroit, and new buildings and apartment houses were constructed behind and between the existing homes in the neighborhood. During World War II, owners rented rooms and divided homes into apartments to house defense industry workers.\n\nAfter the war, residents began leaving the Woodbridge neighborhood for the suburbs. New residents to Woodbridge were less affluent. In the 1960s, the city cleared areas adjacent to the neighborhood to support revitalization. The residents of Woodbridge organized a Citizen's District Council to preserve the neighborhood, and successfully managed to stabilize and preserve many of the remaining homes. Recent activity has shifted perception of Woodbridge from that of an up-and-coming neighborhood to a hotbed of urban revitalization, with the few properties that come up for sale typically subject to bidding wars.\n\nNotable structures within the Woodbridge neighborhood include:\n\n\nDetroit Public Schools operates public schools.\nFrederick Douglass Academy for Young Men is located in Woodbridge.\n\n\nPrevious residents included:\nHenry Cross The Mayor Of Woodbridge\n\n"}

Besides the English names, other common names include: \"gavdaneh\" (Persian), \"kersannah\" (Arabic), \"yero\" (Spanish), \"rovi\" (Greek), and \"burçak\" (Turkish). The nutritional value of the grain for ruminant cattle has guaranteed the continued cultivation of \"V. ervilia\" in Morocco, Spain and Turkey. The crop is easy to cultivate and harvest and can be grown on very shallow, alkaline soils.\n\nThe grain when split resembles red lentils. For human consumption the bitterness of the seeds needs to be removed through leaching by several changes of boiling water. Owing to this bitterness, it is unlikely that someone would accidentally confuse bitter vetch with red lentils. According to Zohary and Hopf, only humans of the poorest economic classes consume this crop, or in times of famine; however, Pliny the Elder states that bitter vetch (\"ervum\") has medicinal value like vetch (\"vicia\"), citing the letters of Augustus where the emperor wrote that he regained his health from a diet of bitter vetch (N.H. 18.38).\n\nThe grain is an excellent sheep and cattle feed concentrate. It has been held in high esteem by farmers in the Old World since the beginning of agriculture to improve the nutritional value of bulk feeds.\n\nThe wild strains of bitter vetch are limited to an area that includes Anatolia and northern Iraq, with an extension south along the Anti-Lebanon Mountains of Syria and Lebanon. Traces of the earliest domesticated instances were recovered from several archeological sites in Turkey, with an uncorrected radiocarbon dating of the 7th and 6th millennia BC.\n"}
{"id": "2214334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214334", "title": "Arthur Collier", "text": "Arthur Collier\n\nArthur Collier (12 October 1680September 1732) was an English Anglican priest and philosopher.\n\nCollier was born at the rectory of Steeple Langford, Wiltshire. He entered Pembroke College, Oxford, in July 1697, but in October 1698 he and his brother William became members of Balliol.\nHis father having died in 1697, it was arranged that the family living of Langford Magna should be given to Arthur as soon as he was old enough.\n\nHaving graduated from Oxford and been made a priest, Collier was presented to the benefice of Steeple Langford in 1704, holding it till his death in 1732.\nHis sermons show no traces of his bold theological speculations, and he seems to have been faithful in the discharge of his duty. Largely due to the extravagance of his wife, he was often in financial difficulties, from which at last he was obliged to free himself by selling the reversion of the Langford advowson to Corpus Christi College, Oxford.\n\nHis philosophical opinions grew out of a diligent study of Descartes and Malebranche. John Norris also strongly influenced him by his \"An Essay towards the Theory of the Ideal or Intelligible World\" (1701–1704). It is remarkable that Collier makes no reference to Locke, and shows no sign of having any knowledge of his works. As early as 1703 he seems to have become convinced of the non-existence of an absolute external world, which would have no relation to a perceiving observer. In 1712 he wrote two essays, which are still in manuscript, one on substance and accident, and the other called \"Clavis Philosophica\". His chief work appeared in 1713, under the title \"Clavis Universalis\", or \"A New Inquiry after Truth, being a Demonstration of the NonExistence or Impossibility of an External World\" (printed privately, Edinburgh, 1836, and reprinted in Metaphysical Tracts, 1837, edited by Sam. Parr). It was favourably mentioned by Reid, Stewart and others, was frequently referred to by the Leibnitzians, and was translated into German by Johann Christian Eschenbach the Elder in 1756, Berkeley's \"Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge\" and \"Theory of Vision\" preceded it by three and four years respectively, but there is no evidence that they were known to Collier before the publication of his book.\n\nHis views are grounded on two presuppositions:\n\nThe former is the basis of the negative part of his argument; the latter supplies him with all the positive account he has to give, and that is meagre enough. The Clavis consists of two parts. After explaining that he will use the term \"external world\" in the sense of \"absolute, self-existent, independent matter\", he attempts in the first part to prove that \"the visible world is not external\", by showing first, that the seeming externality of a visible object is no proof of real externality, and second, that a visible object, as such, is not external.\n\nThe image of a centaur seems as much external to the mind as any object of sense; and since the difference between imagination and perception is only one of degree, God could so act upon the mind of a person imagining a centaur, that he would perceive it as vividly as any object can be seen. Similar illustrations are used to prove the second proposition, that a visible object, as such, is not external.\n\nThe first part ends with a reply to objections based on the universal consent of men, on the assurance given by touch of the extra existence of the visible world, and on the truth and goodness of God (Descartes), which would be impugned if our senses deceived us. Collier argues naively that if universal consent means the consent of those who have considered the subject, it may be claimed, for his view. He thinks with Berkeley, that objects of sight are quite distinct from those of touch, and that the one therefore cannot give any assurance of the other; and he asks the Cartesians to consider how far God's truth and goodness are called in question by their denial of the externality of the secondary qualities.\n\nThe second part of the book is taken up with a number of metaphysical arguments to prove the impossibility of an external world. The pivot of this part is the logical principle of contradiction. From the hypothesis of an external world a series of contradictions are deduced, such as that the world is both finite and infinite, is movable and immovable, &c.; and finally, Aristotle and various other philosophers are quoted, to show that the external matter they dealt with, as mere potentiality, is just nothing at all. Among other uses and consequences of his treatise, Collier thinks it furnishes an easy refutation of the Romish doctrine of transubstantiation. If there is no external world, the distinction between substance and accidents vanishes, and these become the sole essence of material objects, so that there is no room for any change whilst they remain as before. Sir William Hamilton thinks that the logically necessary advance from the old theory of representative perception to idealism was stayed by anxiety to save this miracle of the church; and he gives Collier credit for being the first to make the discovery.\n\nHis \"Clavis Universalis\" is interesting on account of the resemblance between its views and those of Berkeley. Both were moved by their dissatisfaction with the theory of representative perception. Both have the feeling that it is inconsistent with the common sense of mankind, which will insist that \"the very object perceived is the sole reality\". They equally affirm that \"the so-called representative image is the sole reality\", and \"discard as unthinkable the unperceiving material cause\" of the philosophers. Of objects of sense, they say, their \"esse is percipi\". But Collier never got beyond a bald assertion of the fact, while Berkeley addressed himself to an explanation of it. The thought of a distinction between direct and indirect perception never dawned upon Collier. To the question how all matter exists in dependence on percipient mind his only reply is, \"Just how my reader pleases, provided it be somehow\". As cause of our sensations and ground of our belief in externality, he substituted for an unintelligible material substance an equally unintelligible operation of divine power. His book exhibits no traces of a scientific development. The most that can be said about him is that he was an intelligent student of Descartes and Malebranche, and had the ability to apply the results of his reading to the facts of his experience. In philosophy he is a curiosity, and nothing more. His biographer attributes the comparative failure of the Clavis to its inferiority in point of style, but the crudeness of his thought had quite as much to do with his failure to gain a hearing. Hamilton (Discussions, p. 197) allows greater sagacity to Collier than to Berkeley, on the grounds that he did not vainly attempt to enlist man's natural belief against the hypothetical realism of the philosophers. But Collier did so as far as his light enabled him. He appealed to the popular conviction that the proper object of sense is the sole reality, although he despaired of getting men to give up their belief in its externality, and asserted that nothing but prejudice prevented them from doing so; and there is little doubt that, if it had ever occurred to him, as it did to Berkeley, to explain the genesis of the notion of externality, he would have been more hopeful of commending his theory to the popular mind.\n\nIn theology Collier was an adherent of the High Church party, though his views were by no means orthodox. In the Jacobite Mists Journal he attacked Bishop Hoadly's defence of sincere errors. His views on the problems of Arianism, and his attempt to reconcile it with orthodox theology, are contained in \"A Specimen of True Philosophy\" (1730, reprinted in Metaphysical Tracts, 1837) and \"Logology, or a Treatise on the Logos in Seven Sermons on John 1. 1, 2, 3, 14\" (1732, analysed in Metaph. Tracts). These may be compared with Berkeley's \"Sins\".\n\n\n"}

Educated at the University of Aberdeen, Crichton Smith took a degree in English, and after serving in the National Service Army Education Corps, went on to become a teacher. He taught in Clydebank, Dumbarton and Oban from 1952, retiring to become a full-time writer in 1977, although he already had many novels and poems published.\n\nCrichton Smith was brought up in a Gaelic-speaking community, learning English as a second language once he attended school. Friend and poet Edwin Morgan notes that unlike his contemporaries (such as Sorley Maclean and Derick Thomson), Crichton Smith was more prolific in English than in Gaelic, perhaps viewing his writing in what, from Crichton Smith's view, was an imposed non-native language as a challenge to English and American poets. However, Crichton Smith also produced much Gaelic poetry and prose, and also translated some of the work of Sorley Maclean from Gaelic to English, as well as some of his own poems originally composed in Gaelic. Much of his English language work is actually directly related to, or translated from, Gaelic equivalents.\n\nCrichton Smith's work also reflects his dislike of dogma and authority, influenced by his upbringing in a close-knit, island presbyterian community, as well as his political and emotional thoughts and views of Scotland and the Highlands. Despite his upbringing, Crichton Smith was an atheist. A number of his poems explore the subject of the Highland Clearances, and his best-known novel \"Consider the Lilies\" (1968) is an account of the eviction of an elderly woman during such times.\n\nElderly women and alienated individuals are common themes in his work.\n\nCrichton Smith's poetry quite often had a character perhaps based on his mother. He also typically used natural images to convey emotion.\n\nHis poetry includes:\n\n\nHe was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1980.\n\n"}

While a student, for his anti-state activities, he was convicted and imprisoned for six months in Belgrade. After graduating in 1937 he left for Spain where he took part in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side until its conclusion. He was wounded twice, and after the republican defeat interned in Southern France and Germany where he was forced to work in a Nazi airplane factory. He escaped and returned to Zagreb in the summer of 1941.\n\nExperience gained in Spain proved valuable after the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941. His native Croatia was carved up between Italy and the Independent State of Croatia, with Italy fielding a strong occupation force in Dalmatia and Istria. Italian forces were supported by the pro-royal Chetniks in Serb-populated areas. The occupation led many Dalmatians to join the resistance organized by Tito's Partisans. The first detachments formed in Summer 1941 and manned by idealistic but inexperienced youths from coastal towns were poorly led and decimated by Italian units even before they began to operate in the Split hinterland in the vicinity of Sinj. This was a major blow to the resistance movement in Dalmatia. On his return to Zagreb Maks Baće was directed by the Party to travel to Split to discover the causes of that failure. He was then given the task of starting a new uprising which he organized in the region of the Biokovo mountain. He used the war pseudonym \"Milić\" in order to protect his family in Split and throughout the war people knew him only under that name.\nBaće believed that the partisans should rely on the support of rural people in the hinterland, referred to by citifolk as \"peasants,\" and his strategy began to bear fruit in early 1942 when the new partisan detachments proved to be more resilient and more effective in their battles with the Italian, Ustasha and Chetnik forces. \"Milić\" became a popular name among the peasants of the region and he created thousands of new soldiers as the volunteers joined the partisans in large numbers. During an operation in the vicinity of the Dalmatian village Tugare Maks Baće was shot through the chest and left by his comrades as dead. He survived thanks to the care of a local peasant family and then smuggled himself into Split where he reconvalesced. In 1943 he was appointed the commander-in-chief of Partisan Detachments in Dalmatia.\n\nAfter the capitulation of Italy in September 1943 Maks Baće was the partisan officer who accepted the surrender of the Italian forces in Split, and the Partisans briefly took control of much of Dalmatia. However, they were soon expelled by the vastly stronger German forces which replaced the Italians. As one after the other of the Dalmatian islands fell to the Germans, partisan units withdrew to the most distant of them, the island of Vis. Maks Baće commanded the island and sent a controversial telegram to Josip Broz Tito requesting an order from him to defend the island. This he received, along with the reinforcement of another brigade of Partisan forces. A free Vis was later critical to Tito's own escape from German airdrop encirclement in Bosnia (called \"Operation Knight's Leap\") of his Drvar headquarters, as well as the locus of early negotiations between partisans and the Allies. Liberated Vis also served as moral support for the partisans in the many periods of almost hopeless struggle with the militarily superior Germans. In 1944 Baće was one of the founders of OZNA. For his war service, Maks Baće received the coveted medal of the People's Hero of Yugoslavia.\n\nAfter the war Maks Baće was a minister in the government of Yugoslavia, its ambassador to Japan and Sweden and then a member of the Federal Parliament and its Secretary. He was a free thinker viewing party dogma critically and gradually became disillusioned with Communism and the ideological (as opposed to experience-based) political thinking of the regime. In 1971 during Croatian Spring he made the significant political statement of resigning from the Communist Party, and retired to Split, at which point he began to be viewed as a dissident. His absence from public life continued even after the arrival of democracy in the 1990s. When the Croatian media interviewed him at his 90th birthday, he revealed that he was working on a book critical of Karl Marx's thought. The book was finished and published in 2003 as: \"Absurds of Karl Marx\" (). He died of natural causes in his family home at age 91.\n"}

He played for nine different teams over sixteen seasons in Major League Baseball from 1995 until 2010, winning a World Series Championship in 1997. From 2006 to 2017, he served as an on-air personality with Sportsnet in Canada.\n\nZaun, the nephew of former MLB catcher Rick Dempsey, was a high school teammate of Mark Loretta. Zaun and Loretta attended Saint Francis High School in La Cañada, California and graduated in 1989. Zaun was recruited to play college baseball at USC, UCLA, Loyola Marymount and Oklahoma, but signed a letter of intent to play for Texas. However, he chose not to play for Texas upon learning that they had signed a junior college All-American catcher. Zaun also played for the United States national baseball team at the 1989 World Junior Baseball Championship in Canada.\n\nDrafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 17th round of the 1989 Major League Baseball draft, Zaun reached the majors with the Orioles in June 1995. Used primarily as a back-up early in his career, he was traded to the Florida Marlins in 1996. After winning a World Series with the Marlins in 1997, he moved to the Texas Rangers prior to the 1999 season. He has also played with the Kansas City Royals, Houston Astros, and Colorado Rockies. He signed as a free agent with the Blue Jays prior to the 2004 season. In 2004, the Blue Jays were the first team to make Zaun, at 33, a starting catcher. Valuable in the line-up as a switch-hitter, he set a career high in 2005 with 133 games.\n\nPrior to the 2006 season, the Blue Jays signed Bengie Molina as the everyday catcher, making Zaun the backup. Zaun started 2006 on the disabled list, with Jason Phillips serving as Molina's backup during the first week of the year. Zaun hit a game-winning two-run homer off the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' Jason Childers in his return on April 8. Molina's struggles against right-handed pitchers caused John Gibbons to platoon the two, with Molina generally starting against left-handed pitchers and Zaun playing against righties. On September 13, 2006, he hit home runs from both sides of the plate in the same game. He was only the 4th Blue Jay in history to do this.\n\nBecause the Toronto Blue Jays actively pursued Rod Barajas of the Texas Rangers as the club's new starting catcher during the 2006 offseason, it was assumed that Zaun would be exploring free agency as signing Barajas would mean Zaun would be maintained as a backup. Meanwhile, negotiations between Zaun and the club deteriorated, as Zaun claimed that the Jays offered \"slightly better than back-up money for playing every day\". Negotiations with Barajas went as far as an offer conditional on a routine physical, but eventually fell apart for undisclosed reasons. After turning down a reported $6.5 million two-year offer from the Blue Jays a week earlier, Zaun officially accepted a two-year, $7.25 million contract offer to return to the Toronto Blue Jays as their starting catcher on November 28, 2006. The new contract deal also included a third-year option, guaranteed based on appearances. The signing came after Zaun was rumored to have been courted by the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees, both in backup roles.\n\nArguably his most famous play with the Jays was hitting a game-winning grand slam in the bottom of the 13th inning off of Tampa Bay Rays closer Troy Percival, on September 6, 2008 with two outs in the inning, wiping out the Rays, 7–4. Zaun hit only the second game-winning grand slam in Jays history but it was the first that occurred in extra innings, and even more spectacular was that his team was losing at the time, due to an RBI single by Dioner Navarro to put the Rays up, 4–3, before the slam at the top of the 13th.\n\nOn January 22, 2009, Zaun signed a one-year deal with the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nZaun was claimed off waivers by the Tampa Bay Rays GM Andrew Friedman in exchange for Rhyne Hughes on August 7, 2009. On August 16, Zaun hit a pinch hit grand slam home run against his old team the Blue Jays in the 8th inning off Brandon League on a 3–2 fastball. On November 12, 2009, Zaun was granted Free Agency. On December 4, 2009, Zaun signed a one-year contract with the Milwaukee Brewers for $1.9 million. After suffering a severe injury, Zaun's 2010 season—and, as it turned out, his MLB career, ended on May 20. After the season, Milwaukee declined his contract option, and he became a free agent on November 2.\n\nIn January, Zaun signed a minor league deal with the San Diego Padres, with an invitation to spring training. However, noting that he still had not recovered from his previous injury enough to play regularly, he chose to retire on March 7, 2011.\n\nIn 2007, Zaun was included in the Mitchell Report following a 20-month investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs by former Senator George Mitchell. In the report, Kirk Radomski claimed he sold Deca-Durabolin and Winstrol to Zaun in 2001, after a referral from Jason Grimsley. Radomski produced a cheque from Zaun for $500. Mitchell also explained that former Montreal Expos bullpen catcher Luis Perez claimed to have supplied Zaun with steroids in 2002. Zaun declined to be interviewed for the report.\n\nOn February 15, 2008, Zaun responded in detail to the allegations made in the report after issuing a denial as soon as it came out. Zaun vehemently denied taking performance-enhancing drugs, stating that he owed Grimsley $500 and that Grimsley re-wrote the cheque to purchase drugs for himself.

The station is used by 59 million people every year and is one of the busiest in Italy.\n\nIt is at the northern end of the Florence–Rome high-speed railway line \"Direttissima\", which was completed on 26 May 1992 and the southern end of the Bologna–Florence railway line, opened on 22 April 1934. \nA new high speed line to Bologna opened on 13 December 2009. The station is also used by regional trains on lines connecting to: Pisa, Livorno (Leopolda railway); Lucca, Viareggio (Viareggio–Florence railway); Bologna (Bologna–Florence railway) and Faenza (Faentina railway).\n\nThe station was inaugurated on 3 February 1848 to serve the railway to Pistoia and Pisa, and was initially called \"Maria Antonia\" (from the name of the railway, named in honour of Princess Maria Antonia of the Two Sicilies); it was much closer to the Santa Maria Novella church than the current station. It was renamed after the church after the unification of Italy.\n\nIn 1932 through a number of newspaper editorials, published in La Nazione, Florence's main daily, Romano Romanelli a reputed and influential Florentine sculptor, criticized the original project by the Architect Mazzoni for the new Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station. A constructive debate resulted in the final choice of the project sponsored by the Architect Marcello Piacentini and designed by Gruppo Toscano.\n\nThe station was designed in 1932 by a group of architects known as the \"Gruppo Toscano\" (Tuscan Group) of which Giovanni Michelucci and Italo Gamberini, Berardi, Baroni, Lusanna were among the members; the building was constructed between 1932 and 1934. The plan of the building, as seen from above, looks as if it were based on the fascio littorio, the symbol of Benito Mussolini's National Fascist Party, many documents give this explanation, but, that shape was forced by the pre-existing station. The \"blade\" represented by the first two-passenger tracks and the postal ones were in fact the extension of the 1861 alignment which included the tracks of the line from Livorno.\n\nThe building is a prime example of Italian modernism, but has little to do with the Italian Rationalism movement, being more strongly influenced by the Viennese architecture of Loos and Hoffman, with perhaps a nod to Wright; but it is the building's complete originality that makes it outstanding. The competition to design the station was controversial but the approval by Mussolini of the Gruppo Toscano project was hailed as an official acceptance of modernity. The station was designed to replace the aging Maria Antonia Station, one of the few example of architecture by I. K. Brunel in Italy, and to serve as a gateway to the city centre.\n\nThe Gruppo Toscano was only responsible for the main frontal building of the station. The heating plant, platforms, other facilities and details such as benches were all designed in a contrasting style by the official Ministry of Communications architect, Angiolo Mazzoni. The benches and baggage shelves illustrated on this page were not part of the Gruppo Toscano project. Outside and adjacent to the station is also Michelucci's white marble Palazzina Reale di Santa Maria Novella, built to host the Royal family on visits to Florence.\n\nWhile it is of a 'modern' design, the use of pietra forte for the station's stone frontage was intended to respond to and contrast with the nearby Gothic architecture of the church of Santa Maria Novella. The interior of the station features a dramatic metal and glass roof with large skylights over the main passenger concourse, which is aligned perpendicular to the tracks and acts as a pedestrian street connecting one side of the city with the other. The skylights span the passenger concourse without any supporting columns, giving a feeling of openness and vast space and reinforcing the convergence of all the public functions of the station on the passenger concourse.\n\nNear platform #16 there is a statue and a memorial plaque in remembrance of the train loads of Jewish people who were deported from Italy to Nazi concentration camps during World War II.\n\nThe station is served by the following services:\n\n\n\n"}

Chayote or calabash (\"upo\") can also be substituted for green papaya. Instead of pepper leaves, other leafy vegetables can also be used like pechay, spinach, moringa leaves, and mustard greens, among others. Additional ingredients like potatoes and tomatoes can also be added.\n\nOne of the earliest mentions of the dish is in José Rizal's first novel, \"Noli Me Tangere\", where Kapitan Tiago served it to Crisostomo Ibarra upon arriving from Europe. He was given the breast, to the dismay of the corrupt Spanish friar, Padre Damaso, who got chicken neck, which is considered to be the least favored chicken part.\n\n\"Tinola\" is very similar to \"binakol\" and \"ginataang manok\", but differ in that the latter two use coconut water and coconut milk, respectively.

His 45-year career in Canadian football, including 16 years as the league's fourth commissioner (and its longest-serving commissioner), oversaw the start of the modern era of professional Canadian football. As an amateur artist, Gauduar made two important contributions, designing both the Hamilton Tiger-Cats \"Leaping Tiger\" logo, as well as an early version of the CFL logo.\n\nJake Gaudaur, Jr. was born in Orillia, Ontario on October 5, 1920, and was an all-around athlete at Orillia Collegiate Institute. Like his father, Jake Gaudaur Snr., he was a national rowing champion as well as an excellent lacrosse player.\n\nGaudaur was based at Uplands Air Force Base and served as a RCAF pilot during the Second World War spending the war training more pilots.\n\nIn 1940, aged 19, he began playing football and joined the Hamilton Tigers. The following year he played for the Toronto Argonauts. Gaudaur served as a pilot in the Second World War and won the 30th Grey Cup with the Toronto RCAF Hurricanes in the 1942 season.\n\nFollowing the war, Gaudaur played for, and was part owner of, the Toronto Indians of the Ontario Rugby Football Union (1945–1946) and then played for the Montreal Alouettes during the 1947 season.\n\nGaudaur returned to Hamilton to stay in 1948. When the Tigers merged with the Hamilton Flying Wildcats in 1950, Gaudaur became team captain of the resulting Hamilton Tiger-Cats and played through the 1951 season. In 1952, he left the playing field to become director of the team but returned to play a final year in the 1953 season winning the Tiger-Cats first Grey Cup playing centre.\n\nFrom 1954, Gaudaur was President of the Tiger-Cats and was President & General Manager from the 1956 season to 1967. The Ti-Cats appeared in 9 Grey Cups over his term as general manager and won in 1957, 1963, 1965, and 1967.\n\nJake was the 4th Commissioner of the CFL serving from 1968 through 1984.\nDuring Jake's first year as Commissioner, CFL adopted a new Constitution. In 1980, Jake negotiated and signed on behalf of CFL a record television contract with Carling-O'Keefe Breweries for $15.6 million which covered a 3-year period (1981–83). By 1983, CFL signed a record television agreement with Carling-O'Keefe Breweries for $33 million over a 3-year period (1984-1986). When met with a crisis when Nelson Skalbania briefly acquired the Montreal Alouettes, Gaudaur arranged for the league to seize the franchise, rebrand it as the Montreal Concordes, and sell the franchise to a new owner, Charles Bronfman. This, along with the continued television sponsorship, kept the Montreal franchise alive for another five seasons.\n\n\"During his 16-year tenure as commissioner, Gaudaur did wonders for the league. By 1983, new television contracts had increased revenue six-fold, while game attendance had nearly doubled. Gaudaur was also instrumental in establishing a Player Pension Plan and aided greatly in the founding of the Canadian Football Hall of Fame and Museum. Above all, he kept the CFL strictly Canadian. Gaudaur was appointed Governor to Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1981 and took on the duties of chairman of the board in 1984. His fundraising efforts resulted in a $1.25 million renovation programme for the Hall to make it one of the most advanced institutions of its kind at the time.\" \n\nIn his last season as CFL commissioner, in 1983, Jake took a personal interest developing a close bond between the CFL and The War Amps kicking off a special tradition – the annual CFL PLAYSAFE Award, saluting the League's support of the PLAYSAFE Program which continues today.\n\n\nJake had three daughters.\n\nHe died in Burlington, Ontario at the age of 87 in 2007 following a long battle with prostate cancer.\n"}

Since the mid 1980s many of my paintings have been about emotional commitment, and about the way that people touch or do not touch one another, physically and spiritually. Mainly I think intimacy is a matter of approximations; we do the best we can, but most often sympathy, for instance, can only approach empathy, unless it overshoots its goal and sinks in a welter of self-pity. In my experience it is very hard to lose oneself entirely, or give all of oneself, to a cause, or to another human being, or to the act of painting. Although most of these eighteen works on canvas deal with the situation of a single human presence, distorted by mood or circumstance, they are essentially about how hard, and how necessary, it is to try to touch.\"\n\nRecently, Utter has contributed to the upcoming book about friend and colleague Stephen Kasner.

He completed his theological studies at the Protestant seminary of Montauban, and in 1816 was ordained minister. In 1817 he was invited to become pastor of the chapel of St Paul at Jersey, but he declined, being unwilling to subscribe to the \"Thirty-nine Articles\" of the Church of England. During the following twelve years he resided in the Netherlands, and preached before Calvinistic congregations at Amsterdam, Leiden, and Utrecht. In 1830, at the suggestion of Baron Georges Cuvier, then minister of Protestant worship, Coquerel was called to Paris as a pastor of l'Oratoire du Louvre. He succeeded Paul-Henri Marron as principal pastor after Marron's death in 1832. During the course of 1833 he was chosen a member of the consistory, and rapidly acquired the reputation of a great pulpit orator, but his liberal views brought him into antagonism with the rigid Calvinists. He took a warm interest in all matters of education, and distinguished himself so much by his defence of the University of Paris against a sharp attack, that in 1835 he was chosen a member of the consistory of the Legion of Honor. In 1841 appeared his \"Response to the Leben Jesu\" of Strauss.\n\nAfter the revolution of February 1848, Coquerel was elected a member of the National Assembly, where he sat as a moderate republican, subsequently becoming a member of the Legislative Assembly following the May 1849 election, won by the conservative Parti de l'Ordre. He sieged as a member of the legislative commission which prepared the draft for the Falloux Laws on education.\n\nHe supported the first ministry of Louis Napoleon, and gave his vote in favor of the expedition to Rome and the restoration of the temporal power of the pope. After the \"coup d'état\" of 2 December 1851, he confined himself to the duties of his pastorate. He was a prolific writer, as well as a popular and eloquent speaker. He died at Paris on 10 January 1868. A large collection of his sermons was published in 8 vols. between 1819 and 1852. Other works were \"Biographie sacrée\" (1825–1826); \"Histoire sainte et analyse de la Bible\" (1839); \"Orthodoxie moderne\" (1842); \"Christologie\" (1858), &c.\n\nHe married (Amsterdam, 7 September 1819) Anne \"Nancy\" Rattier (8 November 1792 - 24 January 1826) with whom he had 5 children: Athanase (16 June 1820 - 24 July 1875), Charles (2 December 1822 - 12 April 1867,) Helene Rosalie Cecile (30 September 1821 - 20 January 1826), Jean Persis (23 June 1824) and Cécile (20 July 1825 - 2 July 1885). In his second marriage (Amsterdam, 25 October 1827) he married Sophie Mollet (1802 - 1891) and had 3 children: Etienne Jean (9 November 1829 - 15 June 1901), Henri (8 September 1828 - 28 June 1841) and Paul Augustin (20 November 1831 - 1909)\n\nHis brother, Charles Augustin Coquerel (1797–1851), was the author of a work on English literature (1828), an \"Essai sur l'histoire genérale du christianisme\" (1828) and a \"Histoire des églises du desert, depuis la revocation de l'edit de Nantes\" (1841).

A schoolmaster by profession, he became prominent owing to his attacks on orthodox theologians, as well as for his membership of a semi-theological debating society, the Robin Hood Society, which met at the Robin Hood and Little John at Butcher Row. Annet was very hostile to the clergy and to scripture, being a thoroughgoing deist. He distinguished himself by being extremely critical of the character and reputation of King David and the Apostle Paul. In 1739 he wrote and published a pamphlet, \"Judging for Ourselves, or Freethinking the Great Duty of Religion,\" a strong criticism of Christianity. For writing this and similar pamphlets, he lost his teaching position.\n\nA work attributed to him, called \"A History of the Man after God's own Heart\" (1761), intended to show that King George II was insulted by a current comparison with King David. The book is said to have inspired Voltaire's \"Saul\". It is also attributed to one John Noorthouck (Noorthook).\n\nIn 1763 he was condemned for blasphemous libel in his paper called the \"Free Inquirer\", of which only nine numbers were published. After his release he kept a small school in Lambeth, one of his pupils being the politician James Stephen (1758–1832), who became master in Chancery.\n\nAt age 68, Annet was sentenced to the pillory and a year's hard labour. He died on 18 January 1769.\n\nWhen the Christian apologists replaced the argument from miracles with the argument from personal witness and the credibility of Biblical evidence, Annet, in his \"Resurrection of Jesus\" (1744), assailed the validity of such evidence, and first advanced the hypothesis of the illusory death of Jesus, suggesting also that possibly Paul should be regarded as the founder of a new religion. \nIn \"Supernaturals Examined\" (1747) Annet roundly denies the possibility of miracles.\n\nAnnet stands between the earlier philosophic deists and the later propagandists of Thomas Paine's school, and seems to have been the first freethought lecturer (J. M. Robertson); his essays, \"A Collection of the Tracts of a certain Free Enquirer\", are forcible but lack refinement. He invented a system of shorthand (2nd ed., with a copy of verses by Joseph Priestley).\n\n\n"}

Microsoft purchased the company in 2011, and it has since then operated as their wholly owned subsidiary; as of 2016, it is operating as part of Microsoft's Office Product Group. The company is a \"Société à responsabilité limitée\", or SARL, equivalent to an American limited liability company.\n\nSkype, a voice over IP (VoIP) service, was first released in 2003 as a way to make free computer-to-computer calls, or reduced-rate calls from a computer to telephones. Support for paid services such as calling landline/mobile phones from Skype (formerly called SkypeOut), allowing landline/mobile phones to call Skype (formerly called SkypeIn and now Skype Number), and voice messaging generates the majority of Skype's revenue.\n\neBay acquired Skype Technologies S.A. in September 2005 and in April 2009 announced plans to spin it off in a 2010 Initial Public Offering (IPO). In September 2009, Silver Lake, Andreessen Horowitz and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board announced the acquisition of 65% of Skype for $1.9 billion from eBay, valuing the business at $2.75 billion. Skype was acquired by Microsoft in May 2011 for $8.5 billion.\n\nAs of 2010, Skype was available in 27 languages and has 660 million worldwide users, an average of over 100 million active each month, and has faced challenges to its intellectual property amid political concerns by governments wishing to control telecommunications systems within their borders.\n\nSkype was founded in 2003 by Janus Friis from Denmark and Niklas Zennström from Sweden, having its headquarters in Luxembourg with offices now in Tallinn, Tartu, Stockholm, London, Palo Alto, Prague, and Redmond, Washington.\n\nThe Skype software was originally developed by Estonians Ahti Heinla, Priit Kasesalu and Jaan Tallinn, who together with Janus Friis and Niklas Zennström were also behind the peer-to-peer file sharing software Kazaa. In April 2003, Skype.com and Skype.net domain names were registered. In August 2003, the first public beta version was released.\n\nOne of the initial names for the project was \"Sky peer-to-peer\", which was then abbreviated to \"Skyper\". However, some of the domain names associated with \"Skyper\" were already taken. Dropping the final \"r\" left the current title \"Skype\", for which domain names were available.\nIn September 2005, SkypeOut was banned in China. In October of the same year, eBay purchased Skype for $2.6 billion. (In 2011, the \"Ars Technica\" estimated the purchase price at $3.1 billion, not $2.6 billion.) In December 2005, videotelephony was introduced.\nIn April 2006, the number of registered users reached 100 million. In October 2006, Skype 2.0 for Mac was released, the first full release of Skype with video for Macintosh, and in December, Skype announced a new pricing structure, with connection fees for all SkypeOut calls. Skype 3.0 for Windows was released.\n\nIn 2006, a feature called \"Skypecasting\" was introduced as a beta. It allowed recordings of Skype voice over IP voice calls and teleconferences to be used as podcasts. Skypecasting remained in beta until it was discontinued on 1 September 2008. Skypecasts hosted public conference calls for up to 100 people at a time. Unlike ordinary Skype p2p conference calls, Skypecasts supported moderation features suitable for panel discussions, lectures, and town hall forums. Skype operated a directory of public Skypecasts.\n\nThroughout 2007, updates (3.1, 3.2 and 3.5) added new features including Skype Find, Skype Prime, Send Money (which allowed users to send money via PayPal from one Skype user to another), video in mood, inclusion of video content in chat, call transfer to another person or a group, and auto-redial. Skype 2.7.0.49 (beta) for Mac OS X released adding availability of contacts in the Mac Address Book to the Skype contact list, auto redial, contact groups, public chat creation, and an in-window volume slider in the call window. During several days in August, Skype users were unable to connect to full Skype network in many countries because of a Skype system-wide crash which was the result of exceptional number of logins after a Windows patch reboot (\"Patch Tuesday\"). In November, there was controversy when it was announced that users allocated certain London 020 numbers (specifically those beginning '7870') would lose them, after negotiations with the provider of this batch of numbers broke down.\n\nBy early 2008, the tumultuous ownership relations between the founders and eBay had resulted in significant leadership churn, with a succession of Skype presidents including Niklas Zennström, Rajiv Dutta, Alex Kazim, Niklas Zennström (again), and Henry Gomez, all holding that title at various points between 2005 and 2007. The business had failed to meet certain earn-out targets, growth was decelerating, product development had slowed significantly, and in October 2007 eBay took a $1.4 billion 'impairment' on the value of Skype, admitting it had overpaid, and now valuing the company at about $2.7 billion.\n\nIn October 2008, analysis revealed TOM-skype — the Chinese version of Skype run by TOM Online — sends content of text messages and encryption keys to monitoring servers.\n\nFor the six months after the departure of Zennström and Friis, Michael van Swaaij led the company as interim CEO, until the appointment of Josh Silverman in February 2008. Silverman was \"widely viewed as bringing in stability to Skype after a tumultuous phase that followed the exit of the two Skype co-founders.\" Under Silverman's two-and-a-half year tenure, the company focused its product efforts around video calling, ubiquity (gaining high penetration on smartphones, PCs, TVs, and consumer-electronic devices), building tailored offerings for enterprise customers, and diversifying revenue through subscriptions, premium accounts and advertising.\n\nIn advancing this strategy, Skype released many new products, substantially revamping its flagship Windows software (3.8 -> 4.0), and its macOS and Linux software; while introducing new software products for smartphones, and consumer electronics. In 2009, Skype 4.0 was released, featuring full-screen high-quality video calling. the Linux client was updated, and an iPhone application was launched which topped the charts with over 1M downloads in its first two days. Skype also announced the launch of its software for the Android platform.\n\nDuring this period Skype also discontinued lesser-used services such as support for the \"Skype Me\" presence indicator, which meant that a user was interested in receiving Skype calls from a non-contact. Skype also discontinued its SkypeCast service without explanation and added internal monthly and daily usage caps on their SkypeOut subscriptions, which had been advertised as \"unlimited\". Skype also discontinued its \"dragonfly\" feature, a community-generated yellow-pages product, and other features which were deemed to be under-performing or a distraction to management. Many users and observers had commented on the high rate of dropped calls and the difficulty reconnecting dropped calls. Updates including versions for the Sony PSP hand-held gaming system, version 2.0 for Linux with support for video-conferencing.\n\nAs part of its efforts to diversify revenues, Skype launched in April 2008 \"Skype for SIP\", a service aimed at business users. At that time around 35 per cent of Skype's users were business users. In targeted premium products to consumers, Skype launched new monthly premium subscriptions products in May 2010.\n\nMarketing efforts were also re-vamped, with a particular focus on innovative partnerships with TV broadcasters to integrate Skype into their programming. The Oprah Winfrey Show began using Skype regularly to host video calls between Oprah and her viewers at home, culminating in a show dedicated exclusively to the wonders of Skype (\"where the Skype are You\", aired first in May 2009). Skype also became commonly used by network news stations around the world, as a cost-effective replacement for sending satellite trucks, and enabling fast response from citizen journalists. Skype was also integrated into scripted TV programming, such as Californication; and in the seventh season of the U.S. syndicated version of the British game show \"Who Wants To Be a Millionaire\" in a new \"Ask the Expert\" video chat lifeline.\n\nThese efforts led to accelerating growth of Skype's Connected Users and Paying Users and by 2009 Skype was adding about 380,000 new users each day. By the end of 2009 Skype was generating around US$740 million in revenue.\n\nIn January 2010, Josh Silverman was recognized for his accomplishments at Skype by being named First Runner Up in the TechCrunch \"Crunchies\" award for \"Best CEO\", beaten only by Mark Pincus of Zynga.\n\nBuilding on the revitalization which had begun in 2008, eBay announced, in April 2009, plans to spin off Skype through an initial public offering in 2010. In August, Joltid, Ltd. filed a motion with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, seeking to terminate a licensing agreement with eBay which allowed eBay (and therefore Skype) to use the \"peer-to-peer communications technology\" on which Skype is based. If successful, this could have caused a shutdown of Skype as it existed, and made an IPO challenging to execute. In September, eBay announced the sale of 65 per cent of Skype to a consortium of Index Ventures and Silver Lake Partners. Early in September, Skype shut down the Extras developer program. In November, Skype settled the Joltid litigation and acquired all Skype technology in exchange for equity in the company and eBay completed the sale of 70% of Skype to a consortium comprising Silver Lake Partners, Joltid, CPPIB, and Andreessen Horowitz for approximately $2 billion, valuing the entire business at US$2.75 billion.\n\nIn May 2010, Skype 5.0 beta was released, with a capacity to support group video calls involving up to four participants. Also in May, Skype released an updated client for the Apple iPhone that allowed Skype calls to be made over a 3G network. Originally, a 3G call subscription plan was to be instituted in 2011, but Skype eventually dropped the plan. Rounding out its ubiquity push, Skype also announced deep integration of Skype software into the IP-connected TVs from Panasonic, Samsung and Sony.\n\nIn June 2010, following the rapid departure of Daniel Berg, the chief technology officer, and then chief development officer Madhu Yarlagadda, Mark Gillett, an operating partner at Silver Lake Partners, assumed the role of chief development officer, taking responsibility for development of Skype's client software, cloud services and product management following a period of several months working closely with Joshua Silverman to drive the transformation of the business, and the acceleration of cross platform and mobile product delivery.\n\nWith its new found independence and under ownership, Skype's growth accelerated and by 2010, Telegeography estimated that Skype accounted for 25 per cent of the world's international calling minutes. According to their research, the overall international calling market grew a tepid 5 to 6 per cent annually in 2010. \"Skype, however, has seen a huge uptick in growth, particularly in the last two years.\"\n\nOn 9 August 2010, Skype filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise up to US$100 million in an initial public offering. Sources reported that the company expected to raise at least US$1 billion. In October 2010, Skype announced the appointment of Tony Bates as CEO; Bates was a senior VP at Cisco and was responsible for its multibillion-dollar enterprise, commercial and small business division. On 14 October 2010, Skype 5.0 for Windows was released with a number of improvements and feature additions, including a Facebook tab to allow users to SMS, chat with, or call their Facebook friends via Skype from the News Feed. The \"Search for Skype Users\" option was omitted from this version.\n\nOn 14 January 2011, Skype acquired Qik, a mobile video-sharing platform. In March 2011, Skype named Jonathan Chadwick as its new chief financial officer and confirmed that Mark Gillett would serve full-time as chief development and operating officer following the departure of chief financial and administrative officer Adrian Dillon.\n\nOn 10 May 2011, Microsoft announced it had agreed to acquire Skype for $8.5 billion. This marked a 300% increase in value for the company in the three years since the eBay write-down in October 2007. This constitutes Microsoft's second largest acquisition to date. It was announced that Skype will become a division within Microsoft, with Skype's former CEO Tony Bates —now its president— reporting to Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. The price Microsoft agreed to pay for the company is 32 times Skype's operating profits. According to the \"Financial Times\" this raises fears of a new \"tech bubble\". Ars Technica and the BBC have questioned the value for Microsoft in the purchase. Microsoft's acquisition of Skype got EU approval on 7 October 2011.\n\nIn October 2012, one year after the closure of the Skype acquisition, the newly formed Skype Division took responsibility for Microsoft's other VoIP and Unified Communications product Microsoft Lync.\n\nOn 11 July 2013, Microsoft's then-CEO Steve Ballmer announced a reorganization of Microsoft along functional lines and with four engineering groups each led by a senior leader. Microsoft's new Applications and Services Group, led by executive vice president Qi Lu was to include Skype along with Bing and Microsoft Office.  Following a period where the strategy for the Skype business as a part of the broader Microsoft portfolios including Office 365 was established, and Skype's share of the international communications market rose to 36 percent (over 214 billion minutes), Mark Gillett announced that he would be leaving Microsoft to return to Silver Lake.\n\nIn September 2016, after Qi Lu stepped down from Microsoft, Skype and Office became part of the Office Product Group, led by Rajesh Jha. The other part of the former Apps and Services Group (which includes Bing) became part of a new AI and Research Group.\n\nThe Skype North American headquarters was opened in early 2013 after the design was completed by San Francisco architect firm Blitz. Located in Palo Alto, California, the space is designed to encourage interaction and spontaneity, while also introducing a sense of humor into the workplace. Fake lawn, cushions that look like boulders, open spaces, and high ceilings accommodate 250 employees in a building. The Palo Alto headquarters also houses a games room complete with a pool table and table football machine. The office's silver LEED Silver certification means that it received between 50 and 59 points for its environmentally friendly construction.\n\nIn its 2008 Annual Report, eBay admitted to an ongoing dispute between it and Joltid Ltd. over the licensing of its peer-to-peer \"Global Index\" technology in its application. It announced that it terminated a standstill agreement, allowing either company to sue. On 1 April 2009, eBay filed with a UK court to settle the legal dispute. A few days later, eBay announced the planning of a public stock offering in 2010 to spin off Skype as a separate, publicly owned company. Some media outlets characterized the proposed sale and ongoing provision of Skype as being under threat because of the concurrent dispute.\n\nOn 1 September 2009, a group of investors led by Silver Lake bought 65% of Skype for $1.91 billion. This prompted Joltid to countersue eBay on 17 September 2009.\n\nBoth settled the simultaneous suits in November, resulting in Joltid's part-ownership of the newly formed Skype Limited. The final holding share were with Silver Lake reducing their share to 56%, Joltid entered at 14%, and eBay retained 30%.\n\nStreamCast Networks filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, alleging theft of its peer-to-peer technology and violation of the \"Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations\" statute. The complaint, titled; StreamCast Networks Inc v. Skype Technologies, S.A., was filed on 20 January 2006 in Federal Court in the Central District of California and assigned Case Number, 2:2006cv00391. The $4.1 billion lawsuit did not name Skype's parent company, eBay, when initially filed. Streamcast's lawsuit was subsequently amended on 22 May 2006 to include eBay and 21 other party defendants.\n\nIn its lawsuit, Streamcast sought a worldwide injunction on the sale and marketing of eBay's Skype Internet voice communication products, as well as billions of dollars in unspecified damages. The lawsuit was finally dismissed in a decision filed on 19 January 2007.\n\nOn 1 June 2006, Net2Phone (the Internet telephone unit of IDT Corp.) filed a lawsuit against eBay and Skype accusing the unit of infringing , which was granted in 2000. The lawsuit was settled between the parties in 2010.\n\nIn July 2007 Skype was found to be guilty by a German court of violating the GNU General Public License in one of its for-sale products, the SMC WSKP100.\n\nSkype was one of many companies (others include AOL, Microsoft, Yahoo, Cisco) which cooperate with the Chinese government in implementing a system of Internet censorship in mainland China. Critics of such policies argue that it is wrong for companies to profit from censorship and restrictions on freedom of the press and freedom of speech. Human rights advocates such as Human Rights Watch and media groups such as Reporters Without Borders speculate that if companies stopped contributing to the authorities' censorship efforts, the government could be pressured to change.\n\nNiklas Zennström, then chief executive of Skype, told reporters that its joint venture partner in China was operated in compliance with domestic law. \"TOM Online had implemented a text filter, which is what everyone else in that market is doing,\" said Zennström. \"Those are the regulations,\" he said. \"I may like or not like the laws and regulations to operate businesses in the UK or Germany or the US, but if I do business there I choose to comply with those laws and regulations. I can try to lobby to change them, but I need to comply with them. China in that way is not different.\"\n\nIn September 2005, the French Ministry of Research, acting on advice from the General Secretariat of National Defence, issued an official disapproval of the use of Skype in public research and higher education; some services are interpreting this decision as an outright ban. The exact reasons for the decision were not given.\n\nIn May 2006, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) successfully applied the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act to allow wiretapping on digital phone networks.

Joseph Bancroft Reade FRS FRMS (5 April 1801 – 12 December 1870) was an English clergyman, amateur scientist and pioneer of photography. A gentleman scientist, Reade co-founded the Royal Microscopical Society and the Royal Meteorological Society.\n\nBorn Leeds, he was the eldest of six sons and two daughters. His father, Thomas Shaw Bancroft Reade (1776–1841), was a merchant and Christian pamphleteer who actively supported the British and Foreign Bible Society. His mother, Sarah \"née\" Paley (d. 1825), was a relative of William Paley. He was educated at Leeds Grammar School, Trinity College, Cambridge and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, graduating in 1825.\n\nReade was ordained a deacon in the Church of England and became curate of Kegworth, Leicestershire. He married Charlotte Dorothy Farish (1796–1882), niece of William Farish in 1825, and the couple parented three children, none of whom lived beyond 21 years of age. Reade was ordained priest in 1826 and took his master's degree in 1828.\n\nIn 1829, Reade became curate of Halifax Parish Church where he befriended amateur meteorologist John Waterhouse, who would later invent the \"Waterhouse stop\". In 1832 he took a part-time curacy at Harrow Weald, and in 1834 became proprietor of a school in Peckham.\n\nJohn Lee and the Royal Astronomical Society jointly owned the advowson of the parish of Stone, Buckinghamshire and they appointed Reade vicar in 1839. In his 20 years as incumbent, Reade established a school and an astronomical observatory.\n\nIn 1859, Reade became vicar of Ellesborough, Buckinghamshire, and from 1863 until his death, rector of Bishopsbourne, near Canterbury.Towards the end of his life, Reade suffered from cancer and died from jaundice at the Bishopsbourne rectory. He was buried at St Mary's Church.\n\nReade was an enthusiastic amateur scientist. His first work was in optics and, in particular, microscopy. His first scientific paper in 1836 was on the use of a pair of convex lenses to focus light on a microscopic specimen without overheating. Reade was interested in chemistry and botany, performing microscopic investigations of various specimens including microfossils. His knowledge of metal salts led to an 1846 ink patent. A design for a telescope eyepiece won a medal at The Great Exhibition in 1851, and he designed a condenser, known as \"Reade's kettledrum\" (1861), and a novel prism (1869).\n\nIn September 1839, Reade was one of 17 gentlemen scientists who met at 50 Wellclose Square, London, the home of John Thomas Quekett, to found the Microscopical Society of London, which later became the Royal Microscopical Society.\n\nReade was present at the Royal Society to hear William Fox Talbot's first presentations on photography in February 1839 and immediately started to experiment himself.\n\nReade was also at the Royal Society on 14 March to hear Sir John Herschel's seminal paper on photography in which Herschel proposed sodium hyposulfite as a fixer.\n\nHerschel also made some observations on the light sensitivity of silver carbonate, nitrate and acetate as being superior to silver chloride.\n\nReade began experimenting with light-sensitive substances and soon discovered that he could get much better results when the silver salt was applied not to paper but to tanned leather. Allegedly, he used his wife's mittens for experiments. Reade conjectured that the difference in sensitivity was caused by gallic acid used for tanning, and indeed by treating paper with gallic acid before soaking it in silver nitrate solution, he could drastically increase the sensitivity.\n\nIn 1854, Reade testified at the \"Talbot v. Laroche\" trial, where Laroche tried to prove that Talbot's calotype patent was invalid because the use of gallic acid was first discovered by Reade, from whom Talbot learned it. In his testimony, however, Reade upheld Talbot's originality, explaining that while he had used gallic acid for \"preprocessing\" the light-sensitive paper, Talbot was the first to discover that gallic acid can \"reveal\" the latent image in an already exposed paper, \"i.e.\" he was the first to develop a photographic material. In fact, Reade erred in making the latter broad statement, as the earlier Daguerreotype process also involved the chemical development of an initially invisible latent image.\n\n\n\nFor all of R. D.

Returning for his mother's funeral he finds himself involved in the same awful problems, together with some new ones. He also rediscovers the eternal family servant, the ever-changing \"Italian girl\".\n\nEdmund Narraway returns to his family home, an old rectory in the north of England, for the cremation of his mother, Lydia. His brother, Otto, probably drunk, starts giggling during the service, and has to be taken outside. Edmund is disgusted rather than scandalised, yet he immediately finds himself fascinated by Otto's daughter, his own niece, who is now a teenager and, for the first time since Edmund last saw her, sexually mature. After the service Isabel, Otto's apparently neurotic wife, attempts to involve Edmund in her small and frustrated life. He at first refuses. When Edmund later talks to his self-pitying brother, he detects evidence of a sexual tension between Otto and his apprentice David Levkin. Isabel, Otto and Flora all implore Edmund to stay and help them, each for a different reason. In each case, Edmund seems at first untempted, reluctant to get involved, and aware of his own impotence against their troubles. It is finally Flora who gives Edmund a real reason, or excuse, to stay. She confides in him that she is pregnant by another student, and has only him to rely on for assistance. One by one, each character in the house manages to enveigle Edmund in a series of confessions, exposés and almost farcical in flagrante delicto discoveries. Edmund, though sexually aloof and anodyne now seems, somewhat contradictorily, highly prone to getting involved and seeing himself as an integral part of everyone else's problem, if not the means to a solution. He cuts a slightly preposterous and contemptible figure, ever more so as each character, led by David Levkin and Flora, respectively devilish and vituperative, make evident their disgust for him.\n\nMidway through the story we have learnt that Otto is having an affair with Elsa, David's sister; Isabel and her daughter Flora have both had affairs with David, and it is he who made Flora pregnant; 'Maggie', the Italian girl, whose actual name is Maria Magistretti and who was nursemaid to Otto and Edmund, had been having a lesbian affair with Lydia, their recently deceased mother and, it transpires, she is the sole beneficiary of Lydia's will.\n\nAfter all these 'secret' relationships have been revealed, Otto's response is to send David and Elsa Levkin packing. Elsa, in despair, reacts by setting fire to herself and the house. She dies, the house survives. At this surprising turn of events Otto and Edmund now seem reconciled, perhaps in misery, perhaps in astonishment. Similarly, Otto and David act civilised towards each other, and Edmund and David begin to talk honestly and respectfully to each other for the first time. David departs, leaving instructions for Elsa's funeral.\n\nThe fire and Elsa's death seem to have had a cathartic effect on everyone. Isabel finds her independence and leaves Otto. She joyfully announces that she too is pregnant by David. Flora, who ran away from home at the climax now returns to look after her rather helpless father Otto. Maggie generously agrees to split the inheritance equally with Edmund and Otto, and allows Otto to keep the house. The fire damage, incidentally, is all covered by insurance.\n\nTo crest this unexpected wave of redemption Edmund discovers that he has always actually been in love with Maria and she, conveniently, has always been in love with him. The book closes with them preparing to travel by car to Rome.\n\n\nThe major theme of \"The Italian Girl\" is that of resolution and redemption. The final chapters of the book are so heavily steeped in this theme that they have the flavour of a morality play. Good replaces evil. Solutions appear to be problems, and characters develop extra dimensions that enable them to cope, perhaps even to thrive. Secrets are revealed, honesty pervades. A claustrophobic convergence is replaced by divergence and optimism. Characters even set off to romantic or familiar destinations.\n\n\"The Italian Girl\" was adapted for the stage by James Saunders, in collaboration with Iris Murdoch. It was first performed at the Bristol Old Vic on 29 November 1967, directed by Val May. The same production opened on 1 February 1968 at Wyndham's Theatre in London's West End, where it ran for 315 performances.\n\nIn March 2019, it was announced that the London-based award-winning production company Rebel Republic Films, led by director Garo Berberian, has optioned the book and is currently developing a screenplay based on The Italian Girl\n"}

Prince had used twice his initial recording advance on the album, and it had failed to generate a pop hit (although \"Soft and Wet\" became a No. 12 R&B hit). Displeased at his lack of success, Prince quickly recorded the follow-up.\n\nOn October 19, 2019, Prince's estate released an acoustic demo version of \"I Feel For You\" as a single to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the \"Prince\" album release.\n\nOverall, the album was much more diverse and well-received than \"For You\", critically and commercially, selling three million copies. It is notable for containing standard R&B ballads performed by Prince, before he would go on to establish himself with sexual romps on later albums. The album was certified platinum and contained three R&B/dance hits: \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\", \"Sexy Dancer\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\". \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\" sold over two million copies and received a platinum disc, rushing to No. 11 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 (becoming Prince's first hit single) and topped the R&B charts. In addition, it peaked at No. 41 in the United Kingdom (his first entry in the country) and reached number 2 on the \"Billboard\" Dance/Disco Singles chart. Prince performed both \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\" and \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\" on \"American Bandstand\" on 26 January 1980. Overall, the success of this album geared Prince towards his next album, \"Dirty Mind\", which would be called a complete departure from his earlier sound.\n\nReviewing in \"\" (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: \"This boy is going to be a big star, and he deserves it—he's got a great line. 'I want to come inside you' is good enough, but (in a different song) the simple 'I'm physically attracted to you' sets news standards of 'naive,' winning candor. The vulnerable teen-macho falsetto idea is pretty good too. But he does leave something to be desired in the depth-of-feeling department—you know, soul.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2214529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214529", "title": "Spencers Wood", "text": "Spencers Wood\n\nSpencers Wood is a village in the civil parish of Shinfield, Berkshire, England, south of Reading. The village of Three Mile Cross adjoins it to the north. To the west lies the village of Grazeley.\n\nThe earliest confirmed reference to the name 'Spencers Wood' dates from 1500, when a man named John Blunt left 3s 4d for the repair of a road through the wood called Spencers Wood. The name of the wood may derive from the le Despencer family — a Norman family – who held half a knight's fee in Swallowfield in the 13th century, but there is no confirmed documentary evidence for this. Before that, the area was probably part of the Royal Forest (Windsor Forest).\n\nBy 1761 when John Roque published his map of Berkshire, there was no wood as such. There was instead a common – one of a series of commons and greens south of Reading – and on the OS maps of the later nineteenth century, the area is referred to as 'Spencerswood Common', even though the common had by then been enclosed.\n\nThe area from Three Mile Cross to the boundary with Hampshire beyond Riseley, including part of Swallowfield – \"Part Lane\" in Swallowfield marks the partition – was until 1844 a detached portion of Wiltshire. (In the 13th century, Spencers Wood was administered by William Longespée, Earl of Salisbury and his court in Amesbury.) On 20 October 1844 in the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844 the area became part of Berkshire.\n\nAround 1816 a non-conformist chapel (Congregational) was built near the corner of Hyde End Road and Basingstoke Road, set back from the road near the fourth mile post from Reading on the Reading to Basingstoke turnpike. In 1905 it was replaced by a new larger church (nearer the road), which, due to falling attendances, closed in 1999 and was subsequently converted into apartments. In the late nineteenth century this was the only church in the village and, with its Institute serving as a village hall, tennis courts etc, provided a focus for social activity in the village.\n\nBy 1864 all of the common land had been enclosed. On the west side of Basingstoke Road, north of Beech Hill Road, two gentlemen established country estates: the local philanthropist Frederick Allfrey, who built Stanbury (where Wellington Court now is) and William Merry, who was a County magistrate and a visiting magistrate to Reading Gaol, as well as Secretary at War Lord Palmerston's private secretary from 1812 to 1828. The open area in front of Merry's house, Highlands, is still known as 'the Common'. The east side of Basingstoke Road was divided among many owners, who progressively sold off the land for development.\n\nBy 1880, Spencers Wood had become a thriving village with a population of 600, of whom 200 were children. Most of the adults worked in the fields or were in domestic service. Victorian and Edwardian style houses were built along the Basingstoke Road using bricks baked at the local Swain family kiln. The Square became the heart of the village during this building period, and many of these houses still stand.\n\nIn 1990 Frederick Allfrey built an Infants' School opposite the end of Hyde End Road. It closed as a school in 1915, as both Lambs Lane and Ryeish Green schools were open by then. The building continued to be used for educational purposes, but since the 1970s has been used as a library.\n\nIn spite of its growth, Spencers Wood was still split between the ecclesiastical parishes of Shinfield, Swallowfield and Grazeley. This changed in 1908 when the Church of St Michael and All Angels was consecrated. The ecclesiastical parish of Spencers Wood was created five years later, although some parts of the village remained in the parish of Grazeley. In 2004 the parishes of Spencers Wood and Grazeley with Beech Hill were united under a single PCC, and the same year became part of the United Benefice of Loddon Reach.\n\nAlso in 1908, Lambs Lane school opened, ending the need for older children to walk to Swallowfield's Russell Hall, Shinfield or Grazeley School.\n\nThe Arts and Crafts-style Village Hall was opened in 1911 and is run by a board of trustees on behalf of the village inhabitants.\n\nSpencers Wood, being a rural community, was unaffected by the Blitz. Few German bombs fell in the area, which was just as well as the village has no air-raid shelters. One German plane was shot down locally.\n\nRationing also had little effect on the village as the majority of villagers were too poor to notice a real reduction in goods. Food was grown and caught locally as part of the dig for victory programme and the black-market was able to supply all excess demand.\n\nThe main impact of the war was the influx of people. Two coaches of evacuees arrived in the village in September 1939. Evacuee children and local children were educated separately until Christmas 1939. Canadian forces were stationed at Stanbury (where Wellington Court now is) for a while, and a small POW camp was opened there after the Canadians relocated. Some POWs helped on the local farms. The village hall served as the Local Defence Volunteers headquarters. Basingstoke Road was the main road to Aldershot, and frequent troop convoys ran through the village.\n\nAfter the war, many soldiers, evacuees and prisoners of war decided to settle in the village.\n\nThe first street lighting in the village was installed after the war.\n\nIn 1954, Spencers Wood Women's Institute was formed. It was quite successful, with 60 members at its height. It closed in the mid-1980s.\n\nIn the 1960s, the M4 Motorway was built and became a man-made barrier between the village and Reading. In the 1980s, the A33 Swallowfield Bypass severed roads to the village of Grazeley lying to the East.\n\nDespite local opposition, many new houses have been constructed in the village in recent years.\n\n"}

The Brotherhood operates under the slogan \"Islam Is the Solution,\" and aims to establish a democratically introduced civic Islamic state. It has been described as \"a deeply entrenched force, with hundreds of thousands of members and affiliates across the Middle East\".\n\nThroughout the rule of Gamal 'Abd al-Nasser in Egypt, after many assassination attempts and terrorist plots against the State many members of the Muslim Brotherhood were held in concentration camps, where they were tortured. Those who\nescaped arrest went into hiding, both in Egypt and in other countries. One of those tortured was Sayyid Qutb, former editor of the Society's newspaper, a prolific writer of fiction, literary criticism and articles on political and social issues, and author of the bestseller \"Social Justice in Islam\", which set out the principles of an Islamic socialism. He became the Brotherhood's most influential thinker for a time, and in 1959 the organisation's General Guide, Hassan Isam'il\nal-Hudaybi, gave him responsibility for the Brothers detained in prisons and concentration camps. Qutb attempted to interpret the situation in the camps in Islamic terms; these reflections, which he circulated as commentaries on passages from the Qur'an, came to encompass an analysis of the regime that meted out such barbarous treatment to its prisoners.\n\nOutside the prisons, those Brothers who had gone underground began to reorganise. In 1956, those who had been imprisoned but not judged were released. Zaynab al-Ghazali, head of the Association of Muslim Women, organised charitable work to meet the basic needs of these now-impoverished Brothers. Along with Brotherhood leader 'Abd al Fattah Isma'il, she went on to play a key role in rebuilding the organisation. While Al-Ghazali's\nfocus was on Islamic education, other autonomous groups of Brothers also appeared, who were impatient to avenge the suppression of the Brotherhood in 1954. They found the analytical framework and political programme they were looking for in Qutb's writings, which were circulated by Al-Ghazali and in which his assessment of the Nasser regime, and of the way in which it could be overcome, was gradually taking shape.\n\nIn 1964, Qutb was released for several months, and his book \"Milestones\" was published; it was reprinted five times in six months. In it, Qutb argued that humanity was in the midst of a profound crisis caused by the failure to adopt a value system that could allow human beings to live in harmony; the threat of nuclear war was a symptom of this ailment. The value systems that dominated the world had failed to live up to their promises. The Western world's concept of democracy, based on an individualistic ideology, had led to vast social injustice, colonialism and the domination of human beings by capital. In the Eastern bloc, collectivist ideology had failed as well: Marxism had lost touch with its original principles, and had become the ideology of oppressive states. Qutb saw Islam as the solution to humanity's predicament: the entire world (including Egypt) was living in a state of \"jahiliyya\", which can be roughly translated as a way of life characterised by ignorant hostility towards god's will. In particular, human beings erred in allowing themselves to establish their own value systems, instead of accepting god's sovereignty.\n\nAlthough the theme of the failure of both capitalism and socialism was not new in the Brotherhood's discourse, the application of the concept of \"jahiliyya\" to Egyptian society represented an innovation, motivated in part by Qutb's personal experience of the brutality of what had become a\ntotalitarian state.\n\nIn order to play its proper role, Islam needed to find tangible\nexpression in an \"Ummah\", a society of people whose lives\nwere fully in accord with Islamic ethics. A vanguard of\nbelievers was needed to begin creating the \"Ummah\", which would\nthen grow until it encompassed the entire world. Qutb meant for\nhis book to provide \"milestones\" tracing the path that this\nvanguard should follow. Faced with a totalitarian state, he\nadvised them to prepare a \"jihad\" whose military aspect\nwent beyond self-defence, and aimed to overthrow those who had\nusurped the sovereignty that should be God's alone. Qutb's\nview was that this preparation would take up to fifteen\nyears.\n\n\"Milestones\" gave rise to debates within the Brotherhood\nbetween young activists who favoured an immediate coup, and more\nexperienced members such as Zaynab al-Ghazali, who took the view\nthat the organisation should limit itself, for decades if need\nbe, to educational work until it had 75% of the population on its\nside. In August 1965, the government claimed to have\ndiscovered that the Brotherhood was organising a huge\nrevolutionary plot. About 18,000 people were\narrested, 100–200 were imprisoned, and 38 of these were killed in\ncustody during the investigation. The police made systematic use\nof torture during interrogations; many, including Sayyid Qutb and\nZaynab al-Ghazali, were tortured for months. The police\ndestroyed the village of Kardasa, where the police believed a\nsuspect was hiding, and arrested and tortured its entire\npopulation. Raids throughout Egypt were accompanied by an\nintense media campaign against the Brotherhood. On the basis of\nconfessions obtained under torture, Qutb and two other Brothers\nwere hanged in August 1966. In the 1970s, it emerged that the plot\nhad probably been fabricated by the security services as part of\na conflict between different factions within the regime.\n\nAfter Qutb's death, his ideas remained influential but\ncontroversial within the Brotherhood. Some of the younger\nBrothers interpreted Qutb's analysis to mean that anyone who\nfailed to revolt against a tyrannical regime, or whose government\nwas not based on Islamic law, should be regarded as\nexcommunicated; they saw this as a justification of a\nrevolutionary strategy. The Brotherhood's leadership, which\nfavoured a reformist approach, disagreed, pointing\nout that it is sufficient to utter a\nprofession of faith twice in order to become a\nMuslim, and that though there are Muslims who sin, this is\nnot considered grounds for excommunication. In contrast to those\nyoung Brothers who advocated revolution, the leadership\nmaintained the view that the organisation should rely on\neducational work in order to reform Egyptian society. This\npolicy, which has characterised the Brotherhood ever since,\nearned it the scorn of revolutionary Islamic militant groups.\n\nNasser's successor, Anwar al-Sadat, introduced a policy of economic liberalisation and, to a much lesser extent, political liberalisation. In 1971 the concentration camps were closed, and the regime began to gradually release the imprisoned Brothers, though the organisation itself remained illegal; the last of those still\nbehind bars regained their freedom in the general amnesty of 1975. The Brotherhood did not officially designate a new General Guide after Hudaybi's death in 1973; Umar Talmasani\nbecame its most prominent spokesperson. Although the organisation refused to give its allegiance to Sadat, its critics on the Egyptian left chastised it for not\ntaking a clear stand against the regime and against economic inequality. Its members came to include many successful businessmen who had profited from Sadat's free-market economic\npolicies (\"infitah\").\n\nThe Brotherhood's main political demand during this period was the application of \"shari'a\" law; the government responded by initiating a lengthy review of all Egyptian law to determine how best to harmonise it with \"shari'a\". In 1980, the constitution was amended to state that \"shari'a\" \"is the main source of all legislation\".\n\nAnother important objective for the Brotherhood was to persuade the government to allow it to operate legally and to act as a political party, whose representatives would stand for office in Parliament. This request was not granted, and the Political Parties Law of 1977 specifically prohibited parties based on religious affiliation. However, the Brotherhood was tolerated to an extent, and in 1976 it was allowed to publish its monthly newspaper, \"Al-Da'wa\" (\"The Invitation to Islam\"), whose circulation is estimated to have reached 100,000 before it was shut down in 1981.\n\n\"Al-Da'wa\" often focused on the problem of Palestine; its editors disapproved of the Camp David accords of 1978 and the\npeace treaty signed by Egypt and Israel in 1979, arguing that Israel would never accept a peaceful and just solution to the conflict. Articles in \"Al-Da'wa\" tended to portray all Jews, whether Israeli or not, as inherently untrustworthy and guilty of the injustice endured by the Palestinians, and repeated myths typical of anti-Semitic texts. At the same time, and often in the same articles, the paper continued to reject Arab nationalism. The editors also condemned Christian evangelism, communism and secularism.\n\nScholars differ on the Brotherhood's influence on Egyptian politics in the 1970s, but it seems clear that other Islamic political movements came to play a more important role. After Egypt's defeat in the 1967 war with Israel, students and workers had protested against the regime's failure to take responsibility for\nthe defeat, and began to call for a more democratic political system. The broad student movement which took shape was at first mainly secular in nature, but student Islamic groups gradually came to the fore, thanks to their ability to implement practical solutions to problems faced by students in their daily life (such as severe overcrowding), by means of the national student union in which they were increasingly elected to positions of responsibility. When Sadat's economic policies caused severe price increases for basic\nnecessities and appalling degradations in public services (leading to huge riots in January 1977), these groups gained influence outside universities as well. \"Al-Da'wa\" supported\nthe student Islamic movement, and leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood were invited to speak at large, festive gatherings organised by student groups on Islamic holidays. When the\ngovernment began to obstruct the student movement, and then to attack it using riot police, the Brotherhood's relations with the government soured as well.\n\nThe Brotherhood's spokespeople consistently rejected the revolutionary and terrorist violence of the militant Islamic groups that appeared in Egypt during the 1970s (such as \"Al-Jihad\", which assassinated Sadat in October 1981). At the same time, they argued that increasingly brutal police persecution was largely to blame for this radicalisation, and that if the Brotherhood were legalised, it would be able to help prevent extremism by providing Islamic education to young people. These arguments fell on deaf ears; in the months before his assassination, while his popularity was plummeting, Sadat ordered massive arrests among all opposition forces, including the Brotherhood. The arrested Brothers were released in January 1982, having been cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nDuring the presidency of Hosni Mubarak, who succeeded Sadat in 1981 and remained in power until 2011, the Brotherhood's relations with the government are still essentially what they were under Sadat: the Brotherhood is tolerated to a degree, but is officially illegal, is not allowed to distribute literature or assemble in public, and is subject to periodic arrests. It has nevertheless published two newspapers (\"Liwa' al-islam\", \"The Banner of Islam\", and \"al-I'tisam\", \"Adherence\"), maintained regional and national offices and made public statements, and\nbooks by prominent Brothers are sold in bookshops. The Brotherhood has held to its reformist outlook, pursuing a long-term, gradualist approach to the establishment of an Islamic state with popular consent, by reforming society from the bottom up, using persuasion and other nonviolent means.\n\nDespite being outlawed, the Brotherhood has been able to take advantage of political and social developments in Egypt to increase its membership and influence. Egypt's emergency law imposes drastic limits on legal political opposition, and it is widely believed that elections are routinely rigged in favour of the government. However, Islamic charitable organisations and private mosques have flourished; though many of these organisations are apolitical, it is largely within this decentralised network of associations, which pursue different agendas and enjoy different degrees of autonomy from the state, that dissent has found expression. There is also anecdotal evidence that Islamic activists have gained some influence within the state bureaucracy, and that their supporters include many doctors, teachers and administrators. The Muslim Brotherhood has benefited from these developments more than any other Islamic political group, thanks in part to the energetic efforts of a cadre of experienced activists in their thirties and forties, who had honed their skills in the student movement under Sadat and joined the Brotherhood after graduation.\n\nThe Brotherhood has been particularly successful at recruiting young people, including university students and recent graduates. Jobs, material goods, and the money needed for a conventional wedding have been increasingly out of reach for young Egyptians, and rampant corruption and a closed, authoritarian political system have bred alienation (\"ightirab\") and despair. The Islamic revival offers a way of life in which young people can be respected for their piety and Islamic learning rather than for their titles or wealth, and in which it is considered admirable to live simply. The view that it is the duty of every Muslim to be involved in political and social reform (which the Brotherhood particularly emphasises) acts as an antidote to political alienation and defeatism, enabling young people to feel more optimistic about the future. Women from lower-middle-class backgrounds have found that stricter religious observance gives them increased respectability, enabling them to disregard other social codes that would otherwise limit their options in areas such as education, career and marriage. Young people's work in the Brotherhood includes organising Islamic seminars and plays, supporting Brotherhood candidates in elections in student unions, professional associations and parliament, and participating in demonstrations.\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, more and more of the members of Egypt's leading professional associations were economically disadvantaged university graduates; their votes helped Brotherhood candidates gain large majorities on the executive boards of several of these associations, such as those representing lawyers, doctors, pharmacists, scientists and engineers, defeating government, secular, and militant Islamic candidates in open, competitive elections. Under Brotherhood leadership, several professional associations set up programmes to help remedy practical difficulties faced by young graduates, offering health insurance, low-interest loans and training to fill in the gaps left by inadequate university courses. However, the limited resources available to professional associations did not enable these programmes to have a significant effect, and the Brotherhood's success in this arena was due more to voters' perception of its candidates as honest and motivated by a sense of civic duty, in contrast to the corruption that has often characterised professional associations. These associations gave the Brotherhood a platform from which to criticise Egypt's lack of free parliamentary and presidential elections and the use of torture in prisons, and to call for the repeal of the emergency law.\n\nParliamentary elections, though largely closed to opposition, give some indication of the Brotherhood's popularity under Mubarak. In the 1984 elections, the Brotherhood was allowed to run candidates for the Wafd party. In 1987 it was permitted to repeat the experiment, this time switching to the Labour Party. In both cases, the party aligned with the Brotherhood received more votes than all the other opposition parties combined.\n\nStarting in about 1992, the government again resorted to repressive measures to stem the Brotherhood's increasing influence. In 1993, professional associations were placed under direct state control. In 1995 and 1996, over a thousand Brothers were arrested. Several were convicted by military tribunals to several years of hard labour; the main charge was that the accused were members of an illegal organisation that planned to overthrow the government. At the same time, the government directed a huge media campaign against the Brotherhood, accusing it of being a terrorist group. This reaction can best be explained as an effort to stave off a nonviolent, popular challenge to the regime's power, by preventing the Brotherhood from participating in elections. Similarly, in 1998, hundreds of student Islamic activists were arrested just before student union elections. The Brotherhood was particularly vulnerable to this crackdown because of its lack of support among the upper middle classes, industrial workers, and the poorest and least educated segments of Egyptian society.\n\nIncreased government repression led to a conflict between the Brotherhood's \"old guard\", which dominated its Guidance Bureau, and its middle generation of leaders, who favoured cooperation with other political trends, a more open internal debate on political issues, a more concerted effort to gain legality for the organisation and a more liberal interpretation of Islam.\n\nOn 20 January 1996, Hamid Abu an-Nasr, the General Leader of Egypt's MB died. His successor was MB first deputy, Mustafa Mashhur, who had been \"an active member of the underground secret apparatus (al-Jihaz al-Sirri)\" as a youth. He had spent a total of 16 years in prison and was considered a hard liner. The Egyptian interior minister, Hasan al-Alfi, responded with a threatening speech and shortly after a raid on the MB central offices and the arrest of 46 members.\n\nAlso that year, to the dismay of the Brotherhood's senior leadership, a group of prominent middle-generation leaders left the Brotherhood and joined with several Copts to form a new political party, called \"Wasat\" (\"Centre\"), intended to represent \"a civic platform based on the Islamic faith, which believes in pluralism and the alternation of power\". The Wasat Party has won the support of some well-known secular intellectuals, but its repeated requests to become a legal political party have been denied.\n\nAfter a period of soul-searching and retrenchment, the Brotherhood has made a comeback in recent years, as its middle-generation leaders have become more influential within the organisation. In 2000, the Brotherhood ran 76 parliamentary candidates as independents (including one woman, Gihan al-Halafawi, whose victory in her district was disqualified when the government cancelled the election there), and won 17 seats (as many as all the other opposition parties combined), despite the government's strenuous media campaign against it and the arrest of several of its candidates shortly before the vote. In 2001, the Lawyers' Association held open elections for its executive board for the first time in five years; in order to avoid embarrassing the regime, the Brotherhood chose to contest only a third of the seats, and won all of those.\n\nIn its public statements, the Brotherhood has shed the religious intolerance and anti-Semitism expressed in its newspaper in the 1970s. In recent years its spokespeople have said that Copts are welcome to join the organisation (noting that Hassan al-Banna had two Copts as his assistants, and was known for his lack of prejudice towards Copts); Mohammad Mahdi Akef, who became the Brotherhood's General Guide in 2004 at the age of 75 told Al-Jazeera in 2005:\nIslam dignifies Christians and Jews and we hope they treat us the same way. The ignorance of people is what is causing a grudge among them and not their religion.\nIn recent years, the Brotherhood has frequently called for greater democracy in the Middle East. 'Abd al-Mun'im Abu-l-Futuh, one of the middle-generation leaders who is respected both in the Brotherhood and in the Wasat Party, told the International Crisis Group in 2004:\nThe absence of democracy is one of the main reasons for the crisis here, in Egypt and the Middle East. The Muslim Brothers believe that the Western governments are one of the main reasons for the lack of democracy in the region because they are supporting dictatorships in the Arab and Islamic region in general, despite the fact that it has been proved that the absence of democracy and freedom is the reason for terrorism and violence.\nIn 2005, the Brotherhood began participating in pro-democracy demonstrations with the Egyptian Movement for Change (also known as \"Kifaya\", \"enough\"), and many of the Brotherhood's members were arrested, over 700 in May 2005 alone.\n\nIn the 2005 parliamentary elections, the Brotherhood's candidates, who stood as independents, won 88 seats (20% of the total) to form the largest opposition bloc, despite many violations of the electoral process, including the arrest of hundreds of Brotherhood members. Meanwhile, the legal opposition parties won only 14 seats; this revived the debate among secularists and Coptics about whether is cause for worry over the rise of the Brotherhood.\n\nThe Brotherhood made repeated calls for a more democratic political system in Egypt and participated in pro-democracy demonstrations with the Kifaya movement in 2005. Since 2005 Muslim Brotherhood members in Egypt have also become a significant movement online. In 2006 Abdel Menem Mahmoud created the first publicly identified Brotherhood blog, Ana Ikhwan (http://ana-ikhwan.blogspot.com). In an article for Arab Media & Society (http://www.arabmediasociety.com), Courtney C. Radsch of American University explores how the Egyptian blogosphere expanded as many younger members followed suit, especially the activists who were sympathetic to Kefaya and members who wanted to be part of the discussion about the draft party platform. These \"cyberactivists\" are often critical of the organization, such as its rejection of women and Copts as being permitted to hold the presidency, and more liberal than their offline counterparts.\n\nIts 2005 success provoked \"a government counterattack\" against the Brotherhood. Egypt's constitution was amended in 2007 in favor of registered parties and against independents, to the disadvantage of the officially outlawed Brethren which can only field candidates as independents. In 2008 the state disqualified most Brotherhood candidates in the local council elections. The Mubarak regime also launched a wave of arrests and military trials against the Brethren, \"ensnared thousands of rank-and-file members,\" but also important leaders \"who ran the financial apparatus that funnels millions of dollars in donations and investment proceeds into campaigning and social outreach.\" This has weakened the movement, as have some recent controversial positions of the Brotherhood. In 2007 it distributed a draft program for its proposed political party which called for a ban on women or Christians as Egypt's president, and for a special council of Islamic clerics to vet parliamentary legislation. During the 2008-9 Gaza War, some Brotherhood leaders called for Egyptians to go to Gaza and fight Israel, notwithstanding Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2214540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214540", "title": "History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (1939–1954)", "text": "History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (1939–1954)\n\nThe History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (1939–1954) discusses the History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt from its actions during World War II to its official dissolution by the Egyptian government.\n\nIn the late 1930s, in keeping with the Muslim Brotherhood's emphasis on actions rather than words, some members pushed for the organisation to form a military wing to take up armed struggle against British imperial rule, and some were already disobeying the Brotherhood's leadership and taking part in isolated clashes with the police. The Brotherhood's General Guide, Hassan al-Banna, felt that the Society was not ready to engage in military campaigns, and that those who wished to do so \"might take the wrong course and miss the target\". He advocated a more cautious, longer-term plan of forming groups of particularly dedicated members, called \"Battalions\", who would receive rigorous spiritual and physical training; once their numbers were sufficient, Banna felt, the Battalions would be prepared to engage in warfare. This would not involve terrorist or revolutionary action, which Banna rejected completely, but rather (and only as a last resort, if all peaceful strategies failed) openly declared war on imperial occupation. However, the Battalion system failed to develop on the scale Banna hoped for, and pressure from members for armed struggle against the British continued to increase. In 1939, this internal conflict developed into a major crisis, during which some of the most active cadres left the Society to form a rival organisation called Muhammad's Youth. The following year, as a result of this conflict, the Brotherhood created a military wing called the secret apparatus, which nevertheless remained mostly inactive during the war years.\n\nThe Society's official position was that Egypt should refrain from participating in the Second World War. In 1940, in order to ensure Egypt's support of the war effort, which initially seemed to be going very badly for the Allies, Britain replaced the Egyptian government with one whose cooperation it could be sure of. Martial law was imposed, and in 1941 some public figures that Britain considered subversive were arrested. Hassan al-Banna was imprisoned twice (only to be released within weeks), the Brotherhood's journals were suppressed, its meetings were banned and any reference to it in newspapers was forbidden.\n\nThe Brotherhood's leadership was keen to avoid confrontations that could give the government a pretext to suppress the Society altogether. During the war, the Society alternated between avoiding sensitive issues in the interest of self-preservation, and taking risky political positions such as calling for the nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company. During the periods when it kept a low profile, it concentrated on maintaining and expanding its membership base and extending its social welfare programmes, which included humanitarian assistance to the victims of Axis bombings of Egyptian cities. In 1943, the Society replaced its Battalion system with a form of internal organisation called \"families\", a hierarchy of close-knit groups of five members each; members of a family met regularly, usually in their own homes, and assumed responsibility for one another's welfare.\n\nShortages and bombings contributed to political unrest; after a mass demonstration of students in February 1942, the government resigned. British troops then surrounded the king's palace and forced him to accept a government headed by the Wafd party (thus durably damaging the Wafd's credibility in the eyes of Egyptians). The Wafd remained entirely loyal to the British\nthroughout the war, as did the Sa'dist government that followed it in February 1945.\n\nThe first act of the Wafd government installed by the British in 1942 was to dissolve parliament and call for elections. When Banna declared his candidacy, prime minister Nahhas Pasha pressured him to withdraw it. He agreed, but in return he obtained the prime minister's promise that the Brotherhood could resume its normal activities, and that the government would take action to curtail prostitution and the sale of alcoholic drinks. Shortly afterward, the government did indeed make prostitution illegal, and restricted the sale of alcohol, particularly on religious holidays. The Brotherhood was allowed to resume some of its work, but for the next several years the government alternated between repression and friendliness towards the organisation.\n\nDuring the 1940s, the Brotherhood's membership continued to grow; by 1948, it had two thousand branches, and is thought to have had over a million members.\n\nThe candidacies of Banna and several other Brothers were defeated in the rigged 1945 elections, even in their stronghold of Isma'iliyya. The Society's exclusion from parliamentary politics tended to strengthen the position of those members who advocated a more radical confrontation with the state, and to make them increasingly unwilling to submit to Banna's insistence on nonviolent action.\n\nThe presence of Allied troops had created many jobs and led to the establishment of trade unions; after the war, the departure of most of those troops left many unemployed. Inflation rose, the gap between rich and poor widened and wages decreased. During the war, propaganda had poured into Egypt from all sides of the conflict: British and American propaganda about democracy and national independence from Nazi and Soviet aggression, German propaganda about Egyptian and Arab liberation from Western imperialism, and Soviet propaganda about Soviet economic power and social justice. Britain's occupation of Egypt and the conflict in Palestine remained unresolved. Frustration with the political and economic order was endemic, communist ideas were widespread, and activist groups in general found it easy to attract new members.\n\nIn September 1945 the Society adopted a new constitution which formally recognised the structures put in place during the 1938 reorganisation. It also submitted its records to the ministry of social affairs as required by law, and was classified as a \"political, social and religious institution\"; this meant that the government assistance given to charities would only be available for some of its activities. The organisation's social welfare activities were therefore split off into a separate section with its own director and hierarchy, in order to better protect them from political interference.\n\nDuring the post-war years the Brotherhood grew rapidly. It continued to expand its social welfare activities, setting up hospitals, clinics and pharmacies; schools offering technical and academic courses for boys, girls and adults; and small factories to help remedy post-war unemployment.\n\nEgypt's ruling elites were vehemently opposed to communism, and in this, the Brotherhood agreed wholeheartedly with them; the government therefore made attempts to use the Brotherhood as an instrument against its communist opponents. However, conflict between the elites and the Brotherhood was inevitable, because like the communists, the Brothers were activists who appealed to widespread dissatisfaction with the existing social order, and aspired to bring about profound changes to remedy the injustices of Egyptian society.\n\nThe Brotherhood's publications expressed unrelenting hostility towards the government and its policies, and the Brothers were a major force in strikes and nationalist demonstrations. In October 1945, the Society organised a \"people's congress\" on national liberation in Cairo and seven other cities. The Brotherhood and the Wafd were now the two main opposition parties; now that the Wafd was no longer in power, it was just as eager to champion the nationalist cause, and was supported on this issue by the communists. The Brothers therefore found themselves in direct competition with the Wafd for leadership of the nationalist movement. Despite their deep mutual distrust, the two groups joined in the same mass demonstrations on occasion. However, the Brotherhood's refusal to cooperate with communists led to the breakdown of a united front, and to accusations that the Brothers were tools of the government and of the ruling class. The Society strongly rebutted these charges, and indeed organised strikes of its own; this deeply strained its already poor relations with the government, and the Brotherhood\nbecame the target of police harassment and arrests. The youth of the two groups repeatedly came to blows in 1946, and Banna was nearly killed by a bomb attack. After these clashes, representatives of the Brotherhood and the Wafd held secret meetings in order to reach an understanding; this considerably reduced the tensions between the two groups.\n\nIn the same year, prime minister Sidqi Pasha returned from negotiations in London with a draft treaty that the nationalist groups found absolutely unacceptable. Violent student riots broke out. Members of the Brotherhood's secret apparatus started to carry out attacks on Britons as well as on Egyptian police stations, and continued to do so over the next few years. The government responded to this escalating violence with harsh repressive measures, including a wave of arrests among the Brothers and other nationalist groups. Rioting continued throughout 1946, and in December the government resigned.\n\nIn July 1947, having accompanied the new prime minister, Mahmud Fahmi al-Nuqrashi Pasha, to the United Nations, a representative of the Brothers, Mustafa Mu'min, interrupted the UN Security Council discussions on Egypt to make a speech from the spectator's gallery, rejecting all negotiations with Britain and calling for a complete and immediate British withdrawal from Egypt. However, the Security Council took no action.\n\nIn Egypt and among Arabs and Muslims generally, the cause of Palestine continued to inspire strong sympathies; the 1947 UN resolution on the partition of Palestine gave the issue a greater urgency. The Brotherhood sent volunteers to fight in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. During the war, there were numerous bomb attacks on Jews in Cairo; in the \"jeep case\" discussed below, it emerged that members of the Society's secret apparatus had been responsible for at least some of these.\n\nIn March 1948, members of the secret apparatus assassinated judge, Ahmed El-Khazindar Bey, President of the Court of Appeal, who had given a prison sentence to a Muslim Brother for attacking British soldiers. Banna expressed his revulsion at the assassination.\n\nIn December 1948, the Egyptian government released a decree ordering the dissolution of the Society. The police had discovered caches of bombs and other weapons accumulated by the secret apparatus, and though the Brothers insisted that these were for use in the Arab-Israeli war, the government suspected that the Brothers were planning revolution; it was also keen to remove what it saw as one of the main causes of the general political unrest that had become increasingly violent, and increasingly threatening to its authority, since the end of the Second World War. Moreover, because the Brotherhood had its own hospitals, factories and schools, as well as an army in the form of the secret apparatus, the government saw it as a potential parallel state, which Egyptians might come to see as more legitimate than the official one.\n\nAside from charges of involvement in violent attacks against police and foreigners, the government accused the Society of encouraging workers and farmers to go on strike to demand higher wages and ownership of farmland. Many members of the Brotherhood were arrested, and Banna was kept under close police surveillance. Weeks later, with the organisation's hierarchy and communications thoroughly disrupted, a Muslim brother assassinated prime minister Nuqrashi.\n\nBanna condemned this assassination, and tried without success to negotiate with the new government. In January 1949 the police foiled an attempt by a member of the secret apparatus to bomb a courthouse. Banna wrote an open letter repudiating this act, stating that the perpetrators were \"neither Brothers nor Muslims\", and called on members of the Brotherhood to refrain from violence and intimidation. The new prime minister, 'Abd\nal-Hadi, attempted to suppress all dissent by terrorising the population with brutal repressive measures, including the systematic use of torture in the prisons.\n\nBanna wrote a pamphlet in which he rejected all the charges against the Brotherhood and condemned once again the acts of violence committed by its members, including the attacks on Jews; he said the Society's leaders would never have condoned this violence, and had been unable to prevent it because arrests and surveillance had made it impossible for them to exercise their authority. Nevertheless, he argued that these events were, in part, a result of the government's behaviour and the war in Palestine. He denied that the Society had been planning revolution, insisting that its arms had been intended for use only in Palestine in its legitimate partnership with the Arab League. In February 1949, Banna was assassinated by the political police, probably on the orders of the prime minister and the palace.\n\nIn May 1949, after a wave of arrests, a group of Brothers made an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate prime minister 'Abd al-Hadi, leading to still more arrests. By July, some 4,000 Brothers were in prison, where they continued to maintain their organisation (Mitchell 1969, 80). Several trials followed; in one of these, Nuqrashi's assassin was condemned and put to death. The prosecution attempted to show that Banna had been responsible for the assassination, while the defence argued that he had been unable to maintain control over \"extremists\" in the secret apparatus; the court seems to have considered the latter view to be more plausible.\n\nIn the only other trial to reach a conclusion (the \"jeep case\"), thirty-two Brothers were accused of conspiring to overthrow the government by means of terrorism, using illegal stockpiles of weapons, and of organising the murders of judge Khazindar and prime minister\nNuqrashi. The prosecution attempted to show that revolution was the Society's real objective, concealed by the façade of its other activities.\n\nThe defence acknowledged that members of the secret apparatus had formed a terrorist organisation, but maintained that in doing so, they had disobeyed the Brotherhood's leaders and violated its principles. It argued that the Society's activities and objectives were mainly peaceful, and that its weapons and military training were intended only for the legitimate defence of Arabs and Muslims against the British occupation of Egypt and against Zionism in Palestine. The court ruled in favour of the defence. Most of the defendants were acquitted, and the others were given lenient sentences.\n\nAfter the Wafd returned to power in 1950, the Brothers attempted to negotiate with the new government to have the Society legalised again, but could not reach an agreement. Martial law was ended, and all its provisions were abrogated except those that applied to the Brothers. Parliament passed a \"Societies Law\" that specifically targeted the Brotherhood without mentioning it by name, requiring a description and photograph of every member to be given to the authorities. The ministry of the interior announced that it intended to buy the Society's headquarters and use the building as a police station. The Brotherhood resolved all these issues by means of a successful court case, gaining the right to operate legally and the return of its confiscated property.\n\nWhile the Brotherhood was outlawed, competition to replace Hassan al-Banna became intense. Finally, in 1951, in a move that contravened the Society's constitution, an outsider was chosen as Banna's successor: Hassan Isma'il al-Hudaybi, an experienced judge known for his strong aversion to violence, who, it was felt, would give the Society greater respectability. Though not a member, Hudaybi had long been an admirer of Banna. He resigned from the bench in order to become the Society's General Guide, but soon realised that he was meant to be a mere figurehead, and that longstanding members resented his attempts to exercise authority. He spoke out against the secret apparatus and attempted to dissolve it, but only succeeded in alienating its members, who considered themselves fighters in a noble cause.\n\nOn 8 October 1951, the Egyptian prime minister, Nahhas Pasha, unilaterally abrogated the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. This triggered mass demonstrations in support of Egyptian independence; with the help of the army, large numbers of nationalist activists, including many members of the Brotherhood, began preparing for armed conflict with the British in the Canal Zone. Hudaybi, maintaining his opposition to violent action, publicly repudiated these preparations, and appeared to support the palace's intentions to stifle the nationalist movement. This deepened the conflict between Hudaybi and his opponents in the organisation, especially those within the secret apparatus.\n\nOver the next few months, anti-government riots broke out, expressing the nationalist movement's frustration with the government's failure to follow up the abrogation of the treaty with decisive action. On 25 January 1952, British forces attacked an Egyptian police station in the Canal Zone and a pitched battle ensued. The next day, in Cairo, students, police and officers marched together to the parliament to demand a declaration of war against Britain; meanwhile thousands of rioters set fire to the city, leaving much of central Cairo in ruins. The Brotherhood did not participate as an organisation, and Hudaybi issued a statement repudiating the riots, but individual members were involved. Several new governments followed in rapid succession. On 23 July the Free Officers, led by Muhammad Naguib, took power, overthrowing the monarchy; the coup was greeted with enthusiasm throughout Egypt.\n\nThe Brotherhood played a supporting but not crucial role in the revolution. Members of the Free Officers, including Gamal Abdel Nasser (who was to become the leader of the new regime) and Anwar al-Sadat, had had close contacts with the Muslim Brotherhood since the 1940s, and some were members of the Society (Nasser himself may have been one of these). Members of the Brotherhood had fought alongside the officers in Palestine, and had been armed and trained by them for deployment in the Canal Zone in the year preceding the revolution. Despite Hudaybi's ambivalence, the Brotherhood had agreed to assist the revolution, mostly by\nmaintaining order, protecting foreigners and minorities and encouraging popular support for the army coup.\n\nAfter the revolution, relations between the Brotherhood and the junta were initially cordial but quickly soured. Among the reasons for this were the army's unwillingness to share political power, the Brotherhood's insistence on the promulgation of an Islamic constitution, and Hudaybi's deep distrust of Nasser. In 1953, the government\nabolished all political parties and organisations except the Muslim Brotherhood. It then created a new party, the Liberation Rally, intended to win over those Egyptians who remained sceptical about the revolution, and suggested that the Brotherhood should merge with the Liberation Rally. Having alienated all other political groups, the regime could not yet afford to dispense with the Brotherhood's support, but was unwilling to give it a greater role in government.\n\nHudaybi was then subjected to fierce criticism from within the organisation, partly because of the government's efforts to discredit him; his critics felt he had transformed the Society into \"a party of aristocrats\" and \"a movement of words, not action\". This led to a debate about the authoritarian character of the Society's institutions. Some felt that a system based on obedience and loyalty to the leader had been acceptable under Banna because he had won the members' trust; since Hudaybi had been unable to do so, they began to press for more democratic structures. Despite these criticisms, Hudaybi mustered strong support from the Brotherhood's leaders as well as from the rank and file. The secret apparatus was formally dissolved and its leaders expelled.\n\nIn January 1954, the regime sent members of the Liberation Rally to disrupt a Muslim Brothers student gathering using loudspeakers; the confrontation turned into a battle. The government then decreed that the Muslim Brotherhood was to be dissolved, on the grounds that Hudaybi and his supporters had been planning to overthrow the government; he was arrested along with hundreds of others. The junta's use of repressive measures to safeguard its power, which was seen as Nasser's policy in particular, caused its popularity to plummet; this led to anti-Nasser demonstrations and a power struggle between him and General Naguib, and appeared to threaten to end the revolution and restore the old political order. Hudaybi sided with Nasser and with the revolution, earning the release of most of the imprisoned Brothers and the restoration of the Society's authorisation to operate legally. However, the events of January had rankled many members, who now felt that the secret apparatus should not have been abolished after all; it was therefore rebuilt under a new leadership without Hudaybi's knowledge.\n\nThe regime's failure to keep some of the promises it had made to the Society (e.g. concerning the release of prisoners) soon caused their relations to deteriorate again. In a leaked letter to the government, Hudaybi called for the lifting of martial law, a return to parliamentary democracy and an end to press censorship. Meanwhile, Britain and Egypt had resumed negotiations regarding the Suez Canal. An agreement on the terms of a new treaty was announced; Hudaybi immediately criticised it as too generous towards the British and a threat to Egyptian sovereignty. The government then began using police to provoke violent confrontations with the Brotherhood at peaceful gatherings in mosques and other places; a Brotherhood clinic was raided and destroyed. In each case the government blamed the Brothers for instigating the clashes. Hudaybi went into hiding, and the official press launched a vitriolic campaign to discredit him. The government declared that several Brothers who were travelling abroad were guilty of treason, and stripped them of their Egyptian citizenship.\n\nDisagreements within the Society over Hudaybi's criticisms of the government then came to the fore, and Nasser personally made strenuous efforts to persuade the Brotherhood's leaders to have Hudaybi removed from his position. This conflict had the effect of discrediting not only Hudaybi but the rest of the leadership as well. The treaty with Britain was signed on 19 October 1954. Hudaybi\nand other Brotherhood leaders felt it was much better than the previously announced terms, but according to one version of events, the secret apparatus, now invisible and unaccountable to those not involved in it, saw the treaty it as a betrayal of Egypt and decided to act on its own.\nOn 26 October, a member of the secret apparatus fired shots at Nasser while the latter was making a speech; unharmed, Nasser stood firm and finished his speech, declaring that he was ready to die for his country. There are, however, some indications that Nasser and his close associates may have staged the assassination attempt; what is certain is that they had been considering doing so.\n\nThe attempt on Nasser's life gave his popularity a much-needed boost, enabled him to prevail in his power struggle with Naguib, and provided him with the perfect opportunity to eliminate the Brotherhood. The organisation was officially dissolved, its headquarters burned, and thousands of its members arrested. The government organised spectacular trials with little regard for due process of law, while the official press accused Hudaybi and his organisation of every conceivable sort of conspiracy. Six Brothers were hanged, and seven, including Hudaybi, were sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour.\n\n\n"}

In 1962 \"FC Torpedo Kutaisi\" was firstly became a participant in the Soviet Top League. Many famous Georgian football players began their career in this club. For example, when Dinamo Tbilisi won UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1980–81, five footballers were the ex-players of FC Torpedo Kutaisi.\n\nWhen the Georgian National Championships started in 1990, the club changed its name into \"FC Kutaisi\".

We are unable to perceive the road to action as you perceive it...\" They therefore asked him to become their leader; he accepted, founding the Society of the Muslim Brothers.\n\nBanna and his followers began by starting an evening school. In its first few years, the Society was focused on Islamic education, with an emphasis on teaching students how to implement an ethos of solidarity and altruism in their daily lives, rather than on theoretical issues. The General Inspector of Education was greatly impressed, particularly by the eloquent speeches of the working-class members of the Brotherhood. Banna's deputy was a carpenter, and the appointment of people from the lower classes to leading positions became a hallmark of the Brotherhood.\n\nThe Society's first major project was the construction of a mosque, completed in 1931, for which it managed to raise a large amount of money while carefully maintaining its independence from potentially self-interested donors. In the same year, the Society began to receive favourable attention in the press, and a Cairo branch was founded.\n\nIn 1932, Banna was transferred to Cairo at his request, and the organisation's headquarters were moved there. In addition to handling the administration of the Society, Banna gave evening lectures on the Qur'an for \"the poor of the district around the headquarters who were 'without learning and without the will for it'\".\n\nOver the next decade, the Society grew very rapidly. From three branches in 1931, it grew to have 300 across Egypt in 1938; thanks to an unorthodox ideology with mass appeal, and to effective strategies for attracting new members, it had become a major political opposition group with a highly diverse membership.\n\nThe Brotherhood initially resembled an ordinary Islamic welfare society. In the early 1930s, its welfare activities included small-scale social work among the poor, building and repairing mosques and establishing a number of Qur'an schools (whose role in teaching children to read and write was important in a country where 80% of the population was illiterate), setting up small workshops and factories, and organising the collection and distribution of \"zakat\" (the Islamic alms tax). As the Society grew, it increasingly founded benevolent institutions such as pharmacies, hospitals and clinics for the general public, and launched a program to teach adults to read and write by offering courses in coffee-shops and clubs.\n\nHowever, Banna's vision of a new sort of organisation, capable of renewing broken links between tradition and modernity, enabled the Brotherhood to gain a degree of popularity and influence that no welfare society enjoyed. He observed that, in the midst of a flourishing Egyptian civil society and a cultural environment marked by innovations in literature, science and education, religious education had been left behind: the ideas of Islamic religious reformers were not made accessible to the general public, and there was no serious effort to make the history and teachings of Islam comprehensible to the young. He was determined to fill this gap by training a cadre of young, highly motivated preachers equipped with modern teaching methods, independent from the government and the religious establishment, and supported by an effective use of the new mass media.\n\nThe Brotherhood's second General Conference, in 1933, authorised the creation of a publishing company and the purchase of a printing press, which was used to print several newspapers during the next decade. Funds were raised by creating a joint stock company in which only members were allowed to buy shares. This approach, which protected the Society's independence from government and from the wealthy by ensuring that its institutions were owned by its members, became its standard means of financing new projects.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Banna formulated, and the Society began to put into practice, an Islamic ideology that was unusual in several respects. It was, first of all, an ideology of disenfranchised classes. In a country where most political movements, including liberal and modernist ones, were products of the landed aristocracy and the urban elite, the Brotherhood became the voice of the educated middle and lower middle classes (and to a lesser extent of workers and peasants) and the means by which they demanded political participation. Throughout the decade, the Society placed increasing emphasis on social justice; closing the gap between the classes (and thus restoring the egalitarianism of the early Muslims) became one of its main objectives, and Banna voiced ever stronger criticisms of the upper class and the class system as a whole:\nIslam is equal for all people and prefers nobody to others on the grounds of differences in blood or race, forefathers or descent, poverty or wealth. According to Islam everyone is equal... However, in deeds and natural gifts, then the answer is yes. The learned is above the ignorant... Thus, we see that Islam does not approve of the class system.\nAs this ideology took shape over the next two decades, in the absence of a strong socialist party, the Brotherhood called for nationalisation of industries, substantial state intervention in the economy, a greatly reduced maximum wage for senior civil servants, laws to protect workers against exploitation, an Islamic banking system to provide interest-free loans, and generous social welfare programmes, including unemployment benefits, public housing and ambitious health and literacy programmes, funded by higher taxes on the wealthy. By 1948 the Brotherhood was advocating land reform to enable small farmers to own land.\n\nSecondly, Banna's ideology was an attempt to bringing about social renewal through a modern interpretation of Islam. In his view, Egypt was torn between two failed value systems: on the one hand, a doctrinaire religious traditionalism (represented by Al-Azhar University), which Banna saw as anachronistic and irrelevant to the urgent problems faced by ordinary people, and on the other hand, an abandonment of all moral values and an economic free-for-all that impoverished the masses and enabled foreign interests to take control of the economy. He argued that Islam should not be confined to the narrow domain of private life, but should rather be applied to the problems of the modern world, and used as the moral foundation of a national renaissance, a thoroughgoing reform of political, economic and social systems.\n\nThe Brotherhood has sometimes been incorrectly described as advocating a blanket rejection of everything Western; in reality, Banna did not hesitate to draw on Western as well as Islamic thought in the pursuit of this modern approach to Islam, using quotations from authors such as René Descartes, Isaac Newton and Herbert Spencer to support his own arguments. He proposed to send Brotherhood journalists to study journalism at the American University in Cairo, and suggested that another group of Brothers attend the School of Social Service, another Western school: \"its scientific and practical programme will greatly facilitate the training [of the Brothers] in social welfare works\". He was in favour of the teaching of foreign languages in schools: \"We need to drink from the springs of foreign culture to extract what is indispensable for our renaissance.\" His formulation of the concept of nationalism, which was fundamental to the Brotherhood's appeal to young people, combined modern European political concepts with Islamic ones. At the same time, Banna and the Brotherhood decried what they saw as their compatriots' slavish adoration of everything Western and their loss of respect for their own culture and history.\n\nBanna's concept of nationalism was emphatically Islamic, and its long-term goal was to see all humanity united by the Muslim faith. However, the Society had no clear definition of the sort of political system it wished for. The idea of reviving the Islamic caliphate (which had been abolished by Kemal Atatürk in 1924) was sometimes mentioned in the Brotherhood's publications, but Banna was not in favour of it. The chief practical consequence of the Brotherhood's Islamic nationalism was an energetic campaign against colonialism in Egypt and other Islamic countries; this was one of the main reasons for the Society's popularity.\n\nThe term \"jihad\" was a key concept in the Brotherhood's vocabulary: it referred not only to armed struggle to liberate Muslim lands from colonial occupation, but also to the inner effort that Muslims needed to make in order to free themselves from an ingrained inferiority complex and from fatalism and passivity towards their condition. It encompassed the courage to dissent expressed in the maxim \"The greatest jihad is to utter a word of truth in the presence of a tyrannical ruler\" (a \"hadith\" reported by Abu Sa'id al-Khudri) as well as any productive activity that Muslims undertook, on their own initiative, to improve the well-being of the Islamic community.\n\nIn keeping with his call for unity among Muslims, Banna advocated tolerance and goodwill between different forms of Islam. Although the Brotherhood rejected the corruption of some Sufi orders and their excessive glorification of their leaders, a kind of reformed Sufi practice was an important part of the Society's structure. The Society thus tried to bridge the gap between the Salafiyya movement and Sufism, and in the 1940s it tried to promote a \"rapprochement\" between Sunni Islam and Shi'a Islam. More generally, the Society insisted that its members must not try to impose their vision of Islam on others. Its General Law of 1934 stated that their actions must always reflect \"friendliness and gentleness\" and that they were to avoid \"bluntness, crudeness and abuses in words or hints\". Members who violated these principles (e.g. by pressuring unveiled women to veil themselves) were expelled.\n\nThe Brotherhood's openness to a diversity of Islamic belief and practice represented part of its appeal to young people. Banna deplored the rigid preoccupation of some Salafiyya societies with minor points of religious doctrine; he felt that Sufism and other traditional practices should be welcomed, and that the Brotherhood should focus on basic social and political issues rather than on theological hair-splitting.\n\nIn the early 1930s the Brotherhood started its Rover Scouts programme (\"jawwala\"), in which groups of young men were trained in athletics and an ascetic way of life, carried out charitable work, and toured branches of the Brotherhood to strengthen ties between them. The Rover Scouts, whose uniforms, banners and hymns attracted a great deal of attention, became an important means of recruiting new members, and Banna saw them as a way of introducing young men gradually to religion.\n\nIn 1931–32, the Brotherhood underwent an internal crisis; several members challenged Banna's control over the Society's treasury, his general stubbornness, and his insistence on having someone of low social status, a carpenter, as his deputy. Banna's candidate for deputy was overwhelmingly supported by a vote in the Society's General Assembly, and his offer to pay the Society's considerable outstanding debts further strengthened his position, but the conflict persisted until he threatened to expel his opponents from the Brotherhood, at which point they resigned. While some of their complaints about him were certainly justified, the conflict also reflected a more basic disagreement with his conception of the Brotherhood's mission. The secessionists felt that the Society should simply be a traditional Islamic welfare society that local notables could support, and should therefore have open accounts and socially respectable leaders.\n\nIn the aftermath of this conflict, Banna sought to clarify the basis of leadership in the Society, asserting that moral qualities and personal sacrifice were more important than titles, social standing and formal qualifications. In drafting the Society's General Law in 1934, he increased his own authority over the Brotherhood, insisting that authority within the organisation could only be based on complete confidence in the leadership, rejecting calls for increased consultation (\"shura\") and expressing a deep scepticism towards elections, which he felt had shown their failings during the 1931-32 crisis. He also instituted mediation committees to help defuse conflicts as they arose.\n\nBanna then began to place more emphasis on the Society's political responsibilities concerning a variety of issues such as prostitution, alcohol, gambling, inadequate religious education in schools, the influence of Christian missionaries and, most importantly, the struggle against imperialism. In response to critics who accused the Brotherhood of being a political group, Banna replied that involvement in politics was part of Islam: \"Islam does have a policy embracing the happiness of this world.\" While other Islamic organisations remained studiously apolitical during the great upheavals that characterised the 20s and 30s in Egypt, the Brotherhood attracted large numbers of young, educated Egyptians, particularly students, by encouraging and supporting them in campaigning for political causes.\n\nThe Brotherhood's first foray into active involvement in politics concerned the conflicts in Palestine between Zionism, Palestinian Arab nationalism and British rule. Like many other Egyptian associations, the Society raised money to support Palestinian Arab workers on strike during the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, and organised demonstrations and speeches in their favour. The Society also called for a boycott of Jewish shops in Cairo, on the grounds that Egyptian Jews were financing Zionist groups in Palestine. Articles hostile towards Jews (and not merely towards Zionism) appeared in its newspaper, though other articles upheld the distinction between Jews and Zionists.\n\nIn the mid-1930s the Brotherhood developed a formal hierarchical structure, with the General Guide (Banna) at the top, assisted by a General Guidance Bureau and a deputy. Local branches were organised into districts, whose administration had a large measure of autonomy. There were different categories of members, with increasing responsibilities: \"assistant\", \"associate\", \"worker\" and \"activist\". Membership fees depended on the means of each member, and poor members paid no fees. Promotion through the hierarchy depended on the performance of Islamic duties and on knowledge attained in the Society's study groups. This merit-based system was a radical departure from the hierarchies based on social standing that characterised Egyptian society at the time.\n\nIn 1938, Banna came to the conclusion that local conservative notables had gained too much influence in the Society, and that there were too many members with \"empty titles\" who did little practical work. To solve these problems, he introduced substantial organisational changes over the next few years; henceforth the branches' executive committees were chosen by the General Guidance Bureau rather than elected, and in 1941 the elected General Assembly was replaced by a smaller appointed body called the Consultative Assembly. However, the Society's structure remained decentralised, so that branches could continue to operate if the police arrested leading members.\n\nDespite Banna's skepticism concerning elections, manifested in their diminishing role within the Brotherhood, he argued for a kind of democracy when he set out his view of the principles underlying a political Islam in 1938:\nWhen one considers the principles that guide the constitutional system of government, one finds that such principles aim to preserve in all its forms the freedom of the individual citizen, to make the rulers accountable for their actions to the people and finally, to delimit the prerogatives of every single authoritative body. It will be clear to everyone that such basic principles correspond perfectly to the teaching of Islam concerning the system of government. For this reason, the Muslim Brothers consider that of all the existing systems of government, the constitutional system is the form that best suits Islam and Muslims.\nSuch a system would involve elections, but not political parties; Banna rejected party politics, pointing out that the Egyptian political parties of the time were closed off to all but the elites and had become instruments of British imperial rule.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2214557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214557", "title": "Muslim Brotherhood of Syria", "text": "Muslim Brotherhood of Syria\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood of Syria ( \"Al-Ikhwan Al-Muslimun fi Suriya\"), formerly the Islamic Socialist Front, has been described as a branch of the Sunni Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, and as being very loosely affiliated to the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. In its most recent April 2012 manifesto, it \"pledges to respect individual rights\", to promote pluralism and democracy and does not mention Islam.\n\nFounded at the end of World War II, the Muslim Brotherhood of Syria was seen as one of several important political parties in the 1950s. When Syria unified with Egypt to form the United Arab Republic, the disbanding of the Muslim Brotherhood as a political party was a condition of union, one complicated by Gamal Abdel Nasser's conflict in Egypt with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. The Syrian Muslim Brotherhood was banned by the government of the Syrian Arab Republic starting after the 1963 coup by the secularist, pan-Arabist Ba'ath Party. The Muslim Brotherhood played a major role in dissent against the secular Ba'ath Party during the period 1976–1982, and membership in the Brotherhood in Syria became a capital offence in 1980.\n\nFollowing the Hama uprising of 1982 in the wake of the wider Islamist insurgency in Syria (1979–1982), when thousands of armed insurgents and civilians were killed by the military the Brotherhood was effectively broken as an active political force inside Syria.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood in exile was among the 250 signatories of the Damascus Declaration of 2005, a statement of unity by Syrian opposition including the Arab nationalist National Democratic Rally, the Kurdish Democratic Alliance, the Committees of Civil Society, the Kurdish Democratic Front, and the Movement of the Future, and calling for \"peaceful, gradual,\" reform \"founded on accord, and based on dialogue and recognition of the other\".\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood was considered the main opposition group in Syria to the Assad regime on the eve of the 2011 uprising, but failed to make a significant mark on the protests against the Assad regime. The Syrian uprising's core population of protesters came from a younger generation which had come of age in a Syria without significant Muslim Brotherhood presence. However, among the expatriated opposition, the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood has come to be seen by some as the \"dominant group\" or \"dominant force\" in the opposition during the Syrian Civil War as of spring 2012.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood in Syria was founded in the mid-1940s by Mustafa al-Siba'i and Muhammad al-Mubarak al-Tayyib, who were friends and colleagues of the founder of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, Hassan al-Banna. In the first years of Syrian independence the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood was part of the legal opposition, and in the 1961 parliamentary elections it won ten seats. After the 1963 coup brought the secularist, pan-Arabist Ba'ath Party to power, it was banned. The Brotherhood played a major role in the mainly Sunni-based resistance movement that opposed the secular Ba'ath Party, (since 1971 dominated by the Alawite Assad family, adding a religious element to its conflict with the Brotherhood). This conflict developed into an armed struggle in the late 1970s that climaxed in the Hama uprising of 1982, when thousands were killed by the military.\n\nMembership in the Syrian Brotherhood became a capital offence in Syria in the 1980 (under Emergency Law 49) and the Brotherhood was crushed, though it retained a network of support in the country, of unknown strength, and had external headquarters in London and Cyprus. In recent years it has renounced violence and adopted a reformist platform, calling for the establishment of a pluralistic, democratic political system. For many years the leader of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood was Ali Sadreddine Al-Bayanouni, who lives as a political refugee in London.\n\nTowards the end of the 1930s, the ideas of Hassan al-Banna reached Syria as young Syrians, who had graduated from university in Cairo and participated in the Muslim Brotherhood there, returned home and founded associations called \"Muhammad's Youth\" (\"Shabab Muhammad\"), which were to become the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria. The Muslim Brotherhood in Syria was founded in the 1930s (according to lexicorient.com) or in 1945, a year before independence from France, (according to journalist Robin Wright and the Brotherhood itself). The Brotherhood states its founder was Dr. Mustafa al-Siba'i. By 1954, the Syrian association led by Mustafa al-Siba'i offered assistance to its Egyptian sister organisation, which Gamal 'Abd al-Nasser was then subjecting to severe repression.\n\nHowever, it was not until the 1960s that the Syrian Brotherhood came to play a major role in politics, as part of a broad-based resistance movement, which developed into armed struggle, against the secular government. After the secular Ba'athist military coup of 8 March 1963, the new administration drastically restricted political freedoms, and concentrated power in the hands of the military and awarded prominent positions to the country's Alawite minority. Sunni Syrian Islamists – from the majority faith – did not have representation in the government. From the start, Islamic political groups, of which the Brotherhood was the most prominent, represented the strongest opposition to the government. The outlawing of Brotherhood in 1964 resulted in its radicalisation. In 1964 and 1965, strikes and mass demonstrations spread throughout Syria's major cities, especially in Hama, and were crushed by the military. In 1971, General Hafez al-Assad, an Alawite, seized power; in 1973 violent demonstrations broke out again in response to a proposed constitution that did not require the president to be a Muslim. Syria's intervention in the Lebanese civil war in 1976 on the side of the Maronites sparked renewed agitation in Syria, and assassinations began to target members of the Syrian government and prominent Alawites; the Muslim Brotherhood later claimed responsibility for most of these.\n\nOn 16 June 1979, the Muslim Brotherhood carried out an attack on cadets at the Aleppo Artillery School, officially killing 83. \nAround this time, professor Yusef al-Yusef was assassinated in Aleppo, an event often cited by secular activist Wafa Sultan as the reason she came to oppose Islam in general. The Syrian government responded by sentencing to death about 15 prisoners, already accused of being Iraqi agents, for belonging to the Islamic resistance movement. Terrorist attacks then became a daily occurrence, particularly in Aleppo and other northern cities. The government tended to ascribe these attacks to the Brotherhood, but as the armed resistance gained widespread popular support and more loosely defined armed groups appeared, especially in poor neighborhoods, it became difficult to determine the extent of the Brotherhood's involvement.\n\nIn November 1979, a Brotherhood leaflet stated:\n\nWe reject all forms of despotism, out of respect for the very principles of Islam, and we don't demand the fall of Pharaoh so that another one can take his place. Religion is not imposed by force...\n\nIn the days leading to 8 March 1980 (the seventeenth anniversary of the Ba'thist coup), nearly all Syrian cities were paralysed by strikes and protests, which developed into pitched battles with security forces. Many organisations, both religious and secular, were involved, including the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood. The government responded with overwhelming military force, sending in tens of thousands of troops, supported by tanks and helicopters. In and around Aleppo, hundreds of demonstrators were killed, and eight thousand were arrested. By April, the uprising had been crushed.\n\nA newspaper article by the president's brother, Rifaat al-Assad, stated that the government was prepared to \"sacrifice a million martyrs\" (over a tenth of Syria's population at that time) in order to stamp out \"the nation's enemies\". On 7 July 1980, the government passed a law making membership in the Brotherhood punishable by death. Typically, however, the administration practiced indiscriminate, collective punishment: in August, the army executed 80 residents of a block of flats in response to an attack on soldiers stationed in Aleppo. In April 1981, the army executed about 400 of Hama's inhabitants, chosen among male loyalists over the age of 14. This was as a retribution after a failed terrorist attack on an Alawite village near Hama.\n\nDuring a 50-day moratorium on the application of the 7 July law, over a thousand Muslim Brothers turned themselves in, hoping to escape the death penalty; information published about them in the official press may give some insight into the composition of the Brotherhood's membership at that time. Most of those who gave themselves up were students under twenty-five years of age, from Damascus and other large cities; others were schoolteachers, professors or engineers.\n\nIn August, September and November 1981, the Brotherhood carried out three car-bomb attacks against government and military targets in Damascus, killing hundreds of people, according to the official press. On 2 February 1982, the Brotherhood led a major insurrection in Hama, rapidly taking control of the city; the military responded by bombing Hama (whose population was about 250,000) throughout the rest of the month, killing between 10,000 and 30,000 people. The tragedy of the Hama Massacre marked the defeat of the Brotherhood, and the militant Islamic movement in general, as a political force in Syria.\n\nHaving suppressed all opposition, Hafez al-Assad released some imprisoned members of the Brotherhood in the mid-1990s. After his death in 2000, Assad was succeeded by his son, Bashar al-Assad, who initially signalled greater openness to political debate. In May 2001, encouraged by a new political climate, the Muslim Brotherhood published a statement in London rejecting political violence, and calling for a modern, democratic state. Many political prisoners, including Muslim Brothers, were pardoned and released. However, this reform was short-lived; in the same year, the few political freedoms that had been granted were abruptly revoked.\n\nAlthough its leadership is in exile, the Brotherhood continues to enjoy considerable sympathy among Syrians. Riyad al-Turk, a secular opposition leader, considers it \"the most credible\" Syrian opposition group. The Brotherhood has continued to advocate a democratic political system; it has abandoned its calls for violent resistance and for the application of \"shari'a\" law, as well as for Sunni uprisings against Alawites. Al-Turk and others in the secular opposition are inclined to take this evolution seriously, as a sign of the Brotherhood's greater political maturity, and believe that the Brotherhood would now be willing to participate in a democratic system of government.\n\nIn a January 2006 interview, the Brotherhood's leader, Ali Sadreddine Bayanouni, \"said the Muslim Brotherhood wants a peaceful change of government in Damascus and the establishment of a 'civil, democratic state', not an Islamic republic.\" According to Bayanouni, the Syrian government admits having detained 30,000 people, giving a fair representation of the Brotherhood's strength.\n\nAccording to leaked American cables, Syrian President Bashar al Assad allegedly called Hamas an \"uninvited guest\" and said \"If you want me to be effective and active, I have to have a relationship with all parties. Hamas is Muslim Brotherhood, but we have to deal with the reality of their presence\", comparing Hamas to the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood which was crushed by his father Hafez al Assad. He then allegedly claimed Hamas would disappear if peace was brought to the Middle East.\n\nUnlike the MB-led insurgency of 1976–1982, the civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War which started in March 2011 began as a secular and nonviolent youth-led movement. Protesters, mostly formerly apolitical Syrians in their twenties and thirties, came together on a local, grassroots basis and had affiliations to older political ideologies, calling instead for the release of prisoners of conscience, guarantees of democratic freedoms, and the fall of the Assad government. In August, 2011, expatriated Syrian oppositionists formed the Syrian National Council to seek international support for the uprising. The Syrian Muslim Brotherhood officially held five seats in the Syrian National Council, the main opposition umbrella outside Syria, but created a network of alliances with other SNC members, and created a controlling influence on the Council's relief committee. Since the formation of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces in November, 2012, the Syrian National Council has taken a backseat to the Coalition, which is recognized as the external political body of oppositionists \"leading\" the revolution.\n\nIn 2012, Brotherhood activists created the Commission for Civilian Protection (CCP). The CCP is considered to be a front for the Brotherhood, tasked with helping armed units inside Syria connect with each other and with sponsors abroad. Its website lists numerous affiliated factions, distributed across Homs, Damascus, Idlib, and elsewhere; however, most of these groups are small and generally self-identify as members of the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian Islamic Liberation Front. The Syrian Muslim Brotherhood is believed to control, through funding, one-fourth to one-third of the disparate armed rebel brigades known collectively as the Free Syrian Army (FSA).\n\nDespite that, \"The Daily Telegraph\" (London) reported on August 2012 that the Muslim Brotherhood had established its own militia not affiliated to the FSA inside Syria, called \"Armed Men of the Muslim Brotherhood\", with presence in Damascus and other places like Homs or Idlib. Durou al-Thawra Commission (Shields of the Revolution Council) created in 2012 with assistance from the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood allegedly consisting of some 43 fighting units most of them in Idlib or Hama.\n\nAt the same time Brotherhood leaders have been reaching out to reassure leaders in neighboring Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon — as well as the West – that they \"have no intention of dominating a future Syrian political system\" and have \"played down\" their \"growing influence\" in the Syrian opposition. The Syrian MB has assured outsiders that it is \"going to great lengths to ensure\" that its donated weapons \"don't fall into the hands of extremists\".\n\nAccording to Hassan Hassan writing in \"The Guardian\" newspaper in mid-2012, while the Brotherhood did come to dominate the Syrian National Council, a body formed outside Syria, the Brotherhood appears to be more popular among exiles than in the uprising population inside Syria. \"Activists from various parts of Syria have told me that, prior to the uprising last year, the country had almost zero Brotherhood presence.\" \"At least 70%\" of Syria's population – non-Sunnis (Muslim and Christian), Kurds, and tribal groups \"have been outside\" the Brotherhood's influence \"in the past\", and Hassan believes will remain so in the future.\n\nThe Syrian Brotherhood harshly condemned Iranian political intervention in Bahrain. This condemnation was formulated \"politely,\" without any obvious insulting references to Shi'a. However, the effort failed.\n\nThe Syrian Muslim Brotherhood issued a statement declaring Jihad against Russia obligatory (Fard 'ayn) upon all who are able to carry weapons after the Russian military intervention in Syria. They reiterated the Russian Orthodox Church's call of the operation as a Holy War.\n\n\n\"Muraqib\" (\"supreme guide\" or \"General leaders\" (G.L.)) of the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria are/have been\n\n\n\n Official Site\n"}
{"id": "2214558", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214558", "title": "History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt", "text": "History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood is an Islamic organization that was founded in Ismailia, Egypt by Hassan al-Banna in March 1928 as an Islamist religious, political, and social movement. The group spread to other Muslim countries but has its largest, or one of its largest, organizations in Egypt, where for many years it has been the largest, best-organized, and most disciplined political opposition force, despite a succession of government crackdowns in 1948, 1954, 1965 after plots, or alleged plots, of assassination and overthrow were uncovered. Following the 2011 Revolution the group was legalized, and in April 2011 it launched a civic political party called the Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt) to contest elections, including the 2012 presidential election when its candidate Mohamed Morsi became Egypt's first democratically elected president. One year later, however, following massive demonstrations, Morsi was overthrown by the military and arrested. As of 2014, the organization has been declared a terrorist group by Russia, Egypt, UAE, Saudi Arabia and is once again suffering a severe crackdown.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood was founded in 1928 by Hassan al-Banna, along with six workers of the Suez Canal Company. Al-Banna was a schoolteacher, to promote implementing traditional, religious, Islamic sharia law into government and a social regression based on an Islamic ethos of altruism and civic duty, in opposition to what he saw as political and social injustice and to British imperial rule. The organisation initially focused on educational and charitable work, but quickly grew to become a major political force as well, by championing the cause of disenfranchised classes, playing a prominent role in the Egyptian nationalist movement, and promoting a conception of Islam that attempted to restore broken links between tradition and modernity.\n\nOn December 28, 1948 Egypt's prime minister, Mahmoud an-Nukrashi Pasha, was assassinated by Brotherhood member and veterinary student Abdel Meguid Ahmed Hassan, in what is thought to have been retaliation for the government crackdown. A month and half later Al-Banna himself was killed in Cairo by men believed to be government agents and/or supporters of the murdered premier. Al-Banna was succeeded as head of the Brotherhood by Hassan Isma'il al-Hudaybi, a former judge.\n\nIn 1952, members of the Muslim Brotherhood are accused of taking part in arson that destroyed some \"750 buildings\" in downtown Cairo — mainly night clubs, theatres, hotels, and restaurants frequented by British and other foreigners — \"that marked the end of the liberal, progressive, cosmopolitan\" Egypt.\n\nThe Brotherhood supported the military coup that overthrew the monarchy in 1952, but the junta was unwilling to share power or lift martial law and clashed with the Brotherhood.\n\nAfter the attempted assassination of then-president Gamal 'Abd al-Nasser, in 1954, a member of the secret apparatus was accused by the authorities of being the perpetrator of the attempt. Nasser then abolished the Brotherhood and imprisoned and punished thousands of its members.\n\nMany members of the Brotherhood were held for years in prisons and concentration camps, where they were sometimes tortured, during Nasser's rule. In 1964 there was a minor thaw when writer Sayyid Qutb was released from prison only to be arrested again along with his brother Muhammad in August 1965, when he was accused of being part of a plot to overthrow the state—to assassinate the President and other Egyptian officials and personalities—and subjected to what some consider a show trial. The trial culminated in a death sentence for Qutb and six other members of the Muslim Brotherhood and on 29 August 1966, he was executed by hanging.\n\nQutb became the Brotherhood's most influential thinker. He argued that Muslim society was no longer Islamic and must be transformed by an Islamic vanguard through violent revolution. To restore Islam from modern jahiliyya, Muslim states must be overthrown. While Qutb's ideology became very popular elsewhere, in Egypt the Brotherhood's leadership distanced itself from his revolutionary ideology, adhering instead to a nonviolent reformist strategy, to which it has remained ever since.\n\nNasser's successor, Anwar Sadat, became president of Egypt in 1970 and gradually released imprisoned Brothers and enlisted their help against leftist groups. The organisation was tolerated to an extent, but remained technically illegal and subject to periodic crackdowns. Eventually the Brotherhood was key in the assassination of Anwar Sadat.\n\nIn the 1970s, a large student Islamic activist movement took shape, independently from the Brotherhood. Sadat himself became the enemy of the Brotherhood and other Islamist groups after signing a peace agreement with Israel in 1979, and was assassinated by a violent Islamist group Tanzim al-Jihad on October 6, 1981.\n\nIn the 1980s, during Hosni Mubarak's presidency, many of the student Islamist activists joined the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood dominated the professional and student associations of Egypt and was famous for its network of social services in neighborhoods and villages. In order to quell the Brotherhood's renewed influence, the government again resorted to repressive measures starting in 1992. Despite mass arrests, police harassment and an essentially closed political system, Brotherhood candidates have made strong showings in several parliamentary elections.\n\nOver the next ten years the Brotherhood made repeated calls for a more democratic political system. In 1997 Muslim Brotherhood Supreme Guide Mustafa Mashhur told journalist Khalid Daoud that he thought Egypt's Coptic Christians and Orthodox Jews should pay the long-abandoned jizya poll tax, levied on non-Muslims in exchange for protection from the state, rationalized by the fact that non-Muslims are exempt from military service while it is compulsory for Muslims. He went on to say, \"we do not mind having Christians members in the People's Assembly...the top officials, especially in the army, should be Muslims since we are a Muslim country ... This is necessary because when a Christian country attacks the Muslim country and the army has Christian elements, they can facilitate our defeat by the enemy.\" According to The Guardian newspaper, the proposal caused an \"uproar\" among Egypt's six million Coptic Christians and \"the movement later backtracked.\"\n\nIn 2000, 15 MB deputies were elected to the Egyptian parliament. A book detailing the record of the MB deputies in the 2000-2005 Egyptian parliament (\"The Brothers in the 2000-2005 Parliament\") found its parliamentary leader Hamdy Hassan working vigorously to fight cultural expression the Brotherhood felt was unIslamic and blasphemous, from literature to beauty contests. Hassan accused the Minister of Culture (Farouk Hosny) of leading what Hassan called the `current US-led war against Islamic culture and identity`. Another Brotherhood MP (Gamal Heshmat) took credit for forcing culture minister Hosni to ban the publication of three novels on the ground they promoted blasphemy and unacceptable sexual practices.\n\nIn 2005, the Brotherhood participated in pro-democracy demonstrations with the Kifaya movement. In the 2005 parliamentary elections, the Brotherhood's candidates could only stand as independents under the emergency law, but identified themselves by campaigning under the most famous of their slogans - 'Islam Is the Solution'. They won 88 seats (20% of the total) to form the largest opposition bloc despite many violations of the electoral process. Meanwhile, the legally approved opposition parties won only 14 seats.\n\nMore than 1,000 Brothers were arrested before the vote's second and third rounds, and police blocked Brotherhood supporters from entering the polls in some districts, according to independent organizations monitoring the election. Brotherhood leaders also accused the government of changing the final count to lead to a victory for the ruling party candidate in seven districts, a concern echoed by independent monitors. More than 100 Egyptian judges signed a statement condemning \"aggression and acts of thuggery by supporters of the ruling party against the judges while...police forces stood idle.\n\nDuring and after the election the Brethren launched what some have called a \"charm offensive.\" Its leadership talked about its `responsibility to lead reform and change in Egypt.` It addressed the `Coptic issue` stating that `conditions` for Coptic Christians (Copts) would be better `under the Brotherhood group`, and Copts would be \"full citizens, not ahl-dhimma,\" and insinuated that the Brethren would do away with Egypt's decade's old church building-permit system that Coptic Christians felt was discriminatory. Internationally the Brethren launched an English-language website and some of the MB's leaders participated in an Initiative to `Re-Introduc[e] the Brotherhood to the West `, \"listing and addressing many `Western misconceptions about the Brotherhood.`\" An article was written for The Guardian newspaper under the title `No need to be afraid of us`; and another for American Jewish newspaper The Forward.\n\nThis campaign, however, was a direct threat to the Egyptian government and its position as an indispensable ally of the west in its fight against radical Islamist ideologues \"bent on the Islamization of society and permanent conflict with the West.\" The government responded by not only continuing to arrest the Brotherhood's leaders and squeeze its finances, but introduced an amendment of Article 1 of the Egyptian constitution. The amendment would (\"in theory\") have had the effect of \"allowing women, and Christians, to run for any position, including the presidency,\" by defining Egypt as `a state of citizenship` and remove the reference to Islam as `the religion of the state.` When challenged to vote for the new version of the article, the Brotherhood's members of parliament walked out of the legislative chamber.\n\nThe party has also reportedly been weakened by \"missteps\" that have alienated \"many Egyptians\" and reportedly played into the government's hands. In December 2006 masked Brotherhood students at Cairo's Al Azhar University staged a militia-style march, which included the \"wearing of uniforms, displaying the phrase, 'We Will be Steadfast', and drills involving martial arts. This betrayed the group's intent to plan for the creation of militia structures, and a return by the group to the era of 'secret cells'\", according to journalist Jameel Theyabi.\nOthers agreed it was reminiscent of the group's violent past and public outcry ensued.\n\nAccording to one observer: \"after a number of conciliatory engagements and interactions with the West\", the Brotherhood,\n\nretreated into its comfort zone of inflammatory rhetoric intended for local consumption: all suicide bombers are `martyrs`; `Israel` regularly became the Jews`; even its theological discourse became more confrontational and oriented to social conservatism.\n\nTwo years later the Egyptian government amended the constitution, prohibiting independent candidates from running for Parliament, these being the only candidates the Brotherhood could field. It also arrested thousands of its members, many of whom were tried in military courts. The state delayed local council elections from 2006 to 2008, disqualifying most MB candidates. The MB boycotted the election. The government incarcerated thousands of rank-and-file MB members in a wave of arrests and military trials, the harshest such security clampdown on the Brotherhood \"in decades.\"\n\nAll but one of the Brotherhood candidates lost their seats in the 2010 election marred by massive arrests of Brethren and polling place observers. The reaction of a Muslim Brotherhood spokesman to the election was: \"We lost seats and a much deserved representation in the parliament. But we won people's love and support and a media battle that exposed [irregularities in] the elections.\"\n\nFollowing the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 that overthrew Hosni Mubarak, the Brotherhood was legalized and emerged as \"the most powerful group\" and the \"most cohesive political movement\" in Egypt with \"an unparalleled ability to mobilize its followers\". Its newly formed political party—the Freedom and Justice Party—won almost half the seats in the 2011–12 parliamentary election (far more than any other party), and its presidential candidate Mohammed Morsi won the 2012 presidential election. However within a year there were mass protests against his rule and he was overthrown by the military.\n\nIn the January–February 2011 uprising itself, the Brotherhood remained \"on the sidelines\", despite having much to gain from a freer political environment, and the breaking off of some activist splinter groups from the Brotherhood. (Sources in the Brotherhood maintain state security forces threatened to arrest supreme guide Mohammed Badie if any Brethren participated.)\n\nOn 30 April 2011 it launched a new party called the Freedom and Justice Party. The party rejected \"the candidacy of women or Copts for Egypt's presidency\", although it did not oppose their taking cabinet positions. The party won 235 (including 22 allies) out of 498 seats in the 2011–12 Egyptian parliamentary election, almost double the next biggest vote-getting party.\n\nIn the first couple of years after the revolution, there was both cooperation and tension between the Brotherhood and (secular oriented) military. The Brotherhood supported the constitutional referendum in March which was also supported by the Egyptian army and opposed by Egyptian liberals, causing some Egyptians to speculate about deal between the military and the MB. The Brotherhood has denied reports of secret meetings with the ruling SCAF as \"pure lies and imagination.\" There was further criticism of the military after Brotherhood silence in the midst of violent clashes between revolutionaries and the military in late 2011. The refusal of the Muslim Brotherhood to join protests against military rule is said to have stopped the \"second revolution\". With regard to the continuance of thousands of secretive military trials, Human Rights Watch criticised the Brotherhood and other Islamists for only noticing what happened to their fellow Islamists, \"and not to the thousands of civilians standing military trial or sent to military jails\". Egyptian author Ezzedine C. Fishere wrote:\n\nThe Brotherhood, led by the old and the hardliners, has managed to alienate its revolutionary and democratic partners and to scare important segments of society, especially women and Christians. Neither the Brotherhood nor the generals showed willingness to share power and both were keen on marginalising the revolutionary and democratic forces. It is as if they were clearing the stage for their eventual showdown.\n\nIn mid-June 2012, the SCAF dissolved the parliament dominated by the Brotherhood and other Islamists.\n\nDespite earlier remarks by Supreme Guide Mohammed Badie that the Brotherhood would not \"field a candidate for presidency\" as victory and the position of a member of the Brotherhood \"at the helm of power\" might give a foreign power (Israel or the US) a pretext to attack Egypt, a former high level Brotherhood official ran for president in 2012 presidential election. Mohammed Morsi defeated Ahmed Shafiq, a former military officer and prime minister of Mubarak, in the run off. Not waiting for the official result, the Brotherhood declared their candidate the victor and filled Tahrir Square with demonstrators both in opposition to broad powers issued by the military that preclude the latter's subordination to a civilian government, and in fear that SCAF would announce Shafiq the winner of the election and new president. Tensions abated when Morsi was officially declared the election winner on 24 June.\n\nDuring the one year Morsi served as president serious public opposition developed within months. In late November 2012 Morsi 'temporarily' granted himself unlimited powers on the ground that he would \"protect\" the nation from the power structure left over from the Mubarak-era and the power to legislate without judicial oversight or review of his acts. He also put a draft constitution to a referendum that opponents complained was \"an Islamist coup.\" These issues brought hundreds of thousands of protesters to the streets in the 2012 Egyptian protests.\n\nOther complaints included the prosecutions of journalists, the unleashing of pro-Brotherhood gangs on nonviolent demonstrators; the continuation of military trials; and new laws that permitted detention without judicial review for up to 30 days, According to the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), an independent organization, under Morsi \"the Muslim Brotherhood is laying the foundations for a new police state by exceeding the Mubarak regime's mechanisms to suppress civil society.\" Persecution of minorities by Islamic radicals was ignored by Morsi. Two cases being the April 2013 firing on a funeral of Coptic Christians who had themselves been killed in sectarian attacks in the days before, and the June 2013 lynching in public view of four Shiites by (Sunni) Islamists\n\nBy April 2013, according to the Associated Press,\n\nEgypt has become increasingly divided between two camps, with President Mohammed Morsi and Islamist allies on one side and an opposition made up of moderate Muslims, Christians and liberals on the other, a schism essentially over the country's political future after decades of dictatorship. Opponents accuse Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood of seeking to monopolize power, while Morsi's allies say the opposition is trying to destabilize the country to derail the elected leadership.\n\nAdding to the unrest were severe fuel shortages and electricity outages—which evidence suggests were orchestrated by Mubarak-era Egyptian elites.\n\nIn late April the Tamarod (rebellion) movement was founded to campaign to collect signatures calling for Morsi to step down. On 29 June, it announced it had collected more than 22 million signatures. A day later somewhere between 17 and 33 million Egyptian protesters demonstrated across Egypt urging Morsi to step down A lesser number demonstrated in support of him.\n\nOn 3 July, the head of the Egyptian Armed Forces, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, announced President Mohamed Morsi removal from power, suspension of the constitution, and new presidential and Shura Council elections. The crackdown that followed has been called more damaging to \"the Brotherhood's core organization\" than any \"in eight decades\".\n\nOn 14 August, the government declared a month-long state of emergency beginning at 16:00, and the military commenced raids to remove camps of Brotherhood supporters from sit-ins being held throughout the country. Violence escalated rapidly lasting several days and led to the deaths of 638 people—595 civilians and 43 police officers. Some 4000 were injured. In retaliation Brotherhood supporters looted and burned police stations and dozens of churches. By 19 August, al Jazeera reported that \"most\" of the Brotherhood's leaders were in custody. On that day Supreme Leader (Mohammed Badie) was arrested, crossing a \"red line\", as even Hosni Mubarak had never arrested him. Other high-profile members of the Brotherhood (including Khairat El-Shater, and Saad al-Katatni) were arrested or ordered arrested.\n\nOn 23 September, a court ordered the group outlawed and its assets seized. Two days later security forces shuttered the main office of the newspaper of the Freedom and Justice Party, and confiscated its equipment.\n\nGeneral leaders (G.L.) of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (المرشد العام لجماعة الإخوان المسلمون) are\n\n\n\n"}

For many years, it was known as the \"Duke of Burgundy fritillary\", because the adult's chequered pattern is strongly reminiscent of \"true\" fritillaries of the family Nymphalidae.\n\nRiodinidae is currently treated as a distinct family within the superfamily Papilionoidea, but in the past they were held to be the subfamily Riodininae of the Lycaenidae. Earlier, they were considered to be part of the now defunct family \"Erycinidae\", whose species are divided between this family and the subfamily Libytheinae.\n\nThe genus \"Hamearis\", described by Jacob Hübner in 1819 is a monotypic genus of uncertain position (\"incertae sedis\"). Here it is considered part of subfamily Nemeobiinae, tribe Zemerini, within the metalmark butterfly family (Riodinidae). Some authors have instead advocated its separation as type genus of a subfamily of its own, Hamearinae.\n\nThe male has a wingspan of , and the female . The upperside of the wings are marked in a chequered pattern strongly reminiscent of a fritillary butterfly (family Nymphalidae); however, the Duke of Burgundy may be separated by its wing shape. \"Hamearis lucina\" also has a distinctive underwing pattern.\n\nThe species' range is restricted to the Western Palaearctic, from Spain, the UK and Sweden to the Balkans. It is the sole representative of its (sub)family in Europe.\n\n\"Hamearis lucina\" is listed on the German IUCN Red List, but is considered of \"least concern\" on a Europe-wide basis.\n\n\"Hamearis lucina\" was added to the UK Biodiversity Action Plan in 2007. It is also listed in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which requires anyone wishing to trade the species to have a licence. In the first decade of the 21st century the butterfly was in serious decline in the UK due to a lack of appropriate land management and overgrazing. Since 2003, twenty-two projects targeted the butterfly which reversed the threat of local extinction in the North York Moors, Kent and Sussex. It has recolonised former sites and colonised newly created habitat where it had not been previously recorded. From 2005 to 2016 the population trend was up 90% in the UK.\n\nTwo distinct habitats are used in the UK:\nColonies prefer areas where the food plants grow among tussocky vegetation. The species prefers north- or west-facing slopes in downland habitats.\n\nAs adults, the sexes exhibit distinctly different behavioural patterns. Males are highly territorial, defending small sheltered, but warm, areas. Spectacular aerial \"dog fights\" occur between males. Females are less \"showy\", but are prone to wander, frequently travelling 250 m. New colonies have been established more than 5 km from the nearest known existing colony.\n\nEggs are typically laid in small groups (up to eight) on the underside of leaves of a host plant; though they may also be laid singly or on foliage adjacent to the food plant (e.g. if primulas are growing among dense vegetation, old females laying in hot weather). Particularly \"good\" plants or leaves may have eggs from more than one female. The egg is spherical, with a flattened base, measuring 0.6 mm in diameter. The eggs are initially glossy and opaque, turning to a uniform pale green; prior to hatching, they develop a distinct dark purple blotch. Significant, though unintentional, predators of \"H. lucina\" eggs are large snails, as they eat primulas in the spring. The eggs hatch after 7–21 days depending on weather conditions.\n\nNewly emerged caterpillars are almost transparent, with a few long pale hairs. They move down to the base of leaf stems, where they spend the daylight hours (the caterpillars are nocturnal). For most of its first instar (before the first moult), the caterpillar is pale green. There are four instars, lasting about four weeks. The full-grown fourth-instar caterpillar measures 16–17 mm. It is pale brown with a dark brown dorsal stripe and numerous hairs; there is also a central black spot on each segment (inside the dorsal stripe).\n\nCaterpillars feed mostly on the upper leaf surface, leaving leaf-veins intact, and quite unlike slug feeding signs. The caterpillars will not eat yellowed leaves, and will move on to another host plant in search of green leaves. \"Hamearis lucina\" caterpillars do not feed at temperatures below 11 °C or when it is wet. They have no significant predators or parasites.\n\nPupae of \"H. lucina\" are short, just long. They are pale cream (somewhat tinged pink) with evenly spaced dark brown spots and a few pale hairs. They are found either very low in dense grass or on the ground. The pupal stage lasts nine months, with likely high mortality rates. Predators of pupae include shrews and slugs.\n\nIn the UK:\nElsewhere in the species' range, other food plants include:\n\n"}

It is particularly connected with the USC football team.\n\nThe Spirit of Troy is the only collegiate band to have two platinum records. The group has performed with numerous celebrities including John Williams, Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, Radiohead, Beyoncé, Doc Severinsen, George Clinton, Fleetwood Mac, The Three Tenors, John Dolmayan, Shavo Odadjian, Odesza, and The Offspring. In addition, the band has performed for five U.S. presidents, at the Summer Olympics, and on the Academy Awards, Grammy Awards, and the season 7 finale of \"American Idol\".\n\nA contingent of the band has performed at every USC football game, home and away, since 1987. It also makes an international trip at least every other year.\n\nThe Trojan Shrine, the symbol of USC and popularly known as \"Tommy Trojan\", was originally supposed to be named \"The Spirit of Troy\".\n\nThe TMB's first recorded performance was in November 1918 when, at the end of World War I, members of the TMB led a victory parade of America's returning servicemen in New York City. \"Fight On\", the fight song of the University was composed in 1922 and became a part of the TMB tradition. In 1923, the school's alma mater, \"All Hail\", was composed by a member of the TMB, Al Wesson. The TMB gave its first national radio concert on CBS on April 19, 1929. The band participated in the 1932 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles, forming the Olympic Braid in the opening ceremonies in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (coincidentally USC's home stadium).\n\nAfter wearing various uniforms over the years, particularly those with a military-style, the band began using basic, unadorned Trojan-style helmets and uniforms in 1950. Three years later, the TMB adopted \"Conquest\", a song composed by Alfred Newman for the film \"Captain from Castile\" as a victory march. The TMB made its first trip outside of California in 1954, traveling to Portland, Oregon to play a USC-Oregon game that the Trojans would win, 24–14. During the Grammy Awards of 1966, TMB trumpet alumnus Herb Alpert won three Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year. Arthur Bartner took over the program in 1970, and began shaping the band into its current form. Women were allowed to join the band in 1972.\n\nAfter several more uniform changes, the TMB began using more elaborate Trojan helmets with brushes, visors, and ear flaps in 1972. In 1973 the TMB began its tradition of sending the full band to games at USC-Notre Dame rivalry games at Notre Dame Stadium.\n\nIn 1979, the TMB was invited by Fleetwood Mac to perform and record \"Tusk\", the title song for the album \"Tusk\". The album went double-platinum and was adopted as a part of the TMB's traditional selections. Additionally, the band later played on another multi-platinum Fleetwood Mac album, \"The Dance\" (1997).\n\nDuring the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Bartner directed an 800-member All American College Marching Band, 125 of whom were members of the TMB. The year 1987 featured several significant moments for the band: the TMB trumpets performed the fanfare for Pope John Paul II in his visit to Los Angeles, the band performed during Super Bowl XXI in Pasadena, and the band began its current streak of attending all USC home and away football games. In 1988, the TMB performed again at Super Bowl XXII in San Diego, and at the Expo '88 World's Fair held in Brisbane, Australia, during that nation's bicentennial\n\nThe band took several more international trips in the 1990s, including to the Berlin Wall after its fall, Amsterdam, Brussels, Innsbruck, Japan, the then-EuroDisneyLand in France, the Seville Expo '92, and to France to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the D-Day Landings. The band also participated in Super Bowl XXIV in New Orleans and the opening ceremony of the 1994 FIFA World Cup. In 1993, USC alumnus and then U.S. Representative Christopher Cox welcomed the band from the floor of the Congress.\n\nIn 2003, the TMB performed during the Chinese New Year celebration in Hong Kong, a year later it also played at the Great Wall of China, Xi'an, Shanghai as well as returning to Hong Kong for the Chinese New Year. The TMB participated in Expo 2005 in Nagoya, Japan, while also performing in Tokyo and Kyoto. In 2006 the TMB went to Italy and performed in Venice, Florence and in front of the Colosseum of Rome. In 2010, the band traveled to Shanghai, China, once again to play for United States National Day at the 2010 World Expo and in 2014 for the grand opening of the first Old Navy flagship store in China. In 2016 the band became the first American performing group invited to participate in Macau's Chinese new year parade.\n\nAt the end of the 2016 season, the TMB appeared in the 103rd Rose Bowl. This marked the 34th time USC has played in the \"Granddaddy of Them All\".\n\nIn 2014, the Spirit of Troy was declared the best marching band in college football by USA Today's \"College Football Fan Index.\"\n\nThe Spirit of Troy also appeared at Expo 2015 in Milan, Italy to perform as part of the American Pavilion's Fourth of July celebration. This was the band's fifth appearance at a World Expo.\n\nIn 2019, the Spirit of Troy gets its first female drum major.\n\nAlso in 2019, \"The Spirit of Troy, the USC marching band, faced controversy this past weekend (November 16, 2019) after playing during a pre-game student memorial before the Cal-USC football game in Berkeley, CA.\" \"The USC band issued an apology for \"inadvertently\" playing during a tribute to a Cal player who passed away.\"\n\nOn November 22, 2019, an announcement was made on the USC website that Saturday (November 23, 2019) will be Bartner's last appearance as band director at a home football game in his career. \"Bartner will then return for the 2020 football season in a reduced role in order to ensure an orderly transition to the new director. Bartner will officially retire on Jan. 1, 2021.\"\n\nThe Spirit of Troy has appeared in several movies and television shows, including:\n\n\nThe band also appeared in the Academy Award shows of 1976 and 2000 as well as at the 2004 Grammy Awards with OutKast. During the 2009 Grammy Awards, it accompanied Radiohead. The band appeared with Beyoncé Knowles and Hugh Jackman on the 81st Academy Awards in 2009. The Spirit of Troy was used for the opening broadcast of ESPN's West Coast \"SportsCenter\" from Los Angeles. The television drama \"House\" used a section of the Spirit of Troy to play an April Fools' Day prank on its cast during taping. In 2009, the band played on the show \"Dancing with the Stars\". The USC drum line performed with Tommy Lee at the 2009 Guitar Center Drum Off. On April 17, 2010, the band performed \"Welcome Home\" with Coheed and Cambria at the Coachella Music Festival. In fall 2010, the band was used to film the promo video for the return of the television show \"Hawaii Five-0\".\n\nThe band has played at the Hollywood Bowl's \"Tchaikovsky Spectacular\" for over 20 years, helping supplement the Los Angeles Philharmonic during the \"1812 Overture\" finale.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They participated in the Divizia Națională, the top division in Moldovan football. \n\nThe club's name came from Dacia, an ancient civilization which covered parts of modern Moldova. Established in 1999, it entered the Moldovan \"A\" Division in 2000 and was promoted to the first division two years later. They won their first league title in the 2010–11 season, thereby qualifying for the preliminaries of the UEFA Champions League. The team has also taken part in the Europa League on five occasions, but never reached the group stage. The club was disbanded after the 2017 Moldovan National Division season.\n\nFC Dacia was founded in 1999 by Marin Livadaru, Igor Ursachi, Valeriu Plujnic and Alexandru Șcaruba. The team was composed of goalkeeper Ghenadie Gariuc and outfield players including Alexandru Golban, Cornel Popov, Ruslan Rașcu, Serghei Coșciug, Cornel Gafton, Veaceslav Titov, Alexandru Tracalov. The club's initial aim was to compete in the Moldovan \"A\" Division (second tier). Dacia debuted in this league during the 2000–01 season, while Gabriel Stati took over as President in Autumn 2000. The club came 4th in its first season before being promoted to the top-flight Moldovan National Division the following season.\n\nDacia won their first National Division match 1–0 against Nistru Otaci, and ended the 2002–03 season in 4th with qualification to the Intertoto Cup as a result. Here they defeated the Faeroese club GÍ Gøta and Albanian side Partizani Tirana, against whom they five unanswered goals over the two-legged fixture (2–0 and 3–0). Dacia were subsequently eliminated by Germans Schalke 04, losing both legs (1–0 and 2–1).\n\nBefore the 2003–04 season, former Dacia player and second-team coach Emil Caras took over as head coach, leading the side to 5th place in the league and a Moldovan Cup semi-final defeat against fellow Chișinău-based side Zimbru Chișinău. Durfing that cup-run, Dacia recorded the victory in its history, 9–0 against FC Florești.\n\nThe 2004–05 season saw Dacia qualify for the UEFA Cup for the first time after a third-place finish in the league. The Wolves also finished as runners-up in the Moldova Cup after a dramatic loss to Nistru Otaci. Dacia were knocked out of the 2005-06 UEFA Cup in the first round against the Swiss Challenge League team FC Vaduz, losing 2–0 away but winning the home leg 1–0 though Vladimir Jăpălău. The subsequent league campaign ended in sixth position, along with defeat in the Moldova Cup semi-finals against Nistru Otaci. However, Dacia was the winner of a friendly tournament named the Turkmenistan President's Cup in February 2006, winning 4–3 in the final and collecting $20,000 US dollars as a prize.\n\nAfter finishing 4th in the 2006–07 season, Dacia qualified for the 2007 Intertoto Cup, and advanced past the Azerbaijani club Baku FC in the first round via a penalty shoot-out, with Dacia's goalkeeper Mihai Moraru saving. It took another shoot-out in the second round to defeat Swiss club St Gallen. Dacia's third-round opponents were German club Hamburg, whose team of internationals revolving around Dutch playmaker Rafael van der Vaart drew 1–1 in Moldova, but won 4–0 in the return leg to knock Dacia out. The Yellow Wolves received a high assessment from local experts and Dacia were named the Top Team of 2007 by the Moldova Football Association. \n\nThe subsequent 2007–08 league campaign brought Dacia's highest-placed finish as of then, partly due to new vice-president Timur Kuriev who found Russian investors. After the mid-season break, Dacia won five matches in a row to cut their deficit behind holders and league leaders Sheriff Tiraspol to a single point before their encounter on 30 March, which was won by Sheriff. By finishing in second, Dacia made the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Cup and were defeated 4–2 on aggregate by Serbian club Borac Čačak in the first round.\n\nDacia finished as runners-up to Sheriff again in 2008–09, and also reached their second Moldovan Cup final, which they lost 2–0 to Sheriff on 23 May. During the season, manager Emil Caras moved to FC Tiraspol and was replaced by the Ukrainian Roman Pilipchuk, while at the end of the season Victor Bulat received the People's Choice Award. Dacia started the 2009-10 Europa League in the second qualifying round where they were defeated 3–0 on aggregate by Slovak team MŠK Žilina.\n\nIn the 2009–10 season, Dacia were in the third place over the mid-season break, two points off first, but ended the season in 5th. Pilipchuk was replaced as manager by Veaceslav Semionov, and Rustam Polonkoev took over as President. The team made the Moldovan Cup final for the second consecutive season, and were again defeated 2–0 by Sheriff Tiraspol.\n\nDacia began the 2010–11 season in a Europa League qualifier against Montenegrin club FK Zeta, winning on the away-goals rule after a 1–1 aggregate draw, and were then knocked out 2–0 on aggregate by Swedish team Kalmar FF. The Russian coach Igor Dobrovolskiy was appointed as head coach of Dacia before the league season began. Dacia were the sole unbeaten side in the league by their 17th match, which they lost 3–0 to Sheriff Tiraspol. Following that result, they remained unbeaten for the remaining 22 league games of the season. Dacia won their first, and so far only, Moldovan National Division title in 2010–11, finishing 9 points ahead of runners-up Sheriff and denying the Tiraspol club an eleventh consecutive title.\n\nAlso that season, Dacia signed an agreement with the Buiucani sports school to create a reserve team, Dacia-Buiucani.\n\nBefore the 2011–12 season, Dacia won the revived Moldovan Super Cup against Iskra-Stal Rîbnița, with the only goal of the game coming from new signing Vasili Pavlov. In July 2011, Dacia made their UEFA Champions League debut in the second qualifying round, against Georgian champions Zestafoni. Despite winning the home leg 2–0, Dacia lost 3–0 in the return leg and were eliminated. Dobrovolski was replaced with Igor Negrescu during the league season, and Dacia finished as runners-up as Sheriff regained their title.\n\nDacia entered the 2012-13 UEFA Europa League in the first qualifying round, where they beat Slovenians Celje 1–0 in each leg. In the second qualifying round, against IF Elfsborg of Sweden, Dacia won the first leg 1–0 before losing the second 2–0 away and were subsequently eliminated.\n\nOn 13 March 2018, Dacia announced that they would not be participating in the 2018 Moldovan National Division.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The kernel can be understood as the derivative of the Green's function for the Laplace equation. It is named for Siméon Poisson.\n\nPoisson kernels commonly find applications in control theory and two-dimensional problems in electrostatics.\nIn practice, the definition of Poisson kernels are often extended to \"n\"-dimensional problems.\n\nIn the complex plane, the Poisson kernel for the unit disc is given by\n\nThis can be thought of in two ways: either as a function of \"r\" and \"θ\", or as a family of functions of \"θ\" indexed by \"r\".\n\nIf formula_2 is the open unit disc in C, T is the boundary of the disc, and \"f\" a function on T that lies in \"L\"(T), then the function \"u\" given by\n\nis harmonic in D and has a radial limit that agrees with \"f\" almost everywhere on the boundary T of the disc.\n\nThat the boundary value of \"u\" is \"f\" can be argued using the fact that as \"r\" → 1, the functions \"P\"(\"θ\") form an approximate unit in the convolution algebra \"L\"(T). As linear operators, they tend to the Dirac delta function pointwise on \"L\"(T). By the maximum principle, \"u\" is the only such harmonic function on \"D\".\n\nConvolutions with this approximate unit gives an example of a summability kernel for the Fourier series of a function in \"L\"(T) . Let \"f\" ∈ \"L\"(T) have Fourier series {\"f\"}. After the Fourier transform, convolution with \"P\"(\"θ\") becomes multiplication by the sequence {\"r\"} ∈ \"l\"(Z). Taking the inverse Fourier transform of the resulting product {\"rf\"} gives the Abel means \"Af\" of \"f\":\n\nRearranging this absolutely convergent series shows that \"f\" is the boundary value of \"g\" + \"h\", where \"g\" (resp. \"h\") is a holomorphic (resp. antiholomorphic) function on \"D\".\n\nWhen one also asks for the harmonic extension to be holomorphic, then the solutions are elements of a Hardy space. This is true when the negative Fourier coefficients of \"f\" all vanish. In particular, the Poisson kernel is commonly used to demonstrate the equivalence of the Hardy spaces on the unit disk, and the unit circle.\n\nThe space of functions that are the limits on T of functions in \"H\"(\"z\") may be called \"H\"(T). It is a closed subspace of \"L\"(T) (at least for \"p\"≥1). Since \"L\"(T) is a Banach space (for 1 ≤ \"p\" ≤ ∞), so is \"H\"(T).\n\nThe unit disk may be conformally mapped to the upper half-plane by means of certain Möbius transformations. Since the conformal map of a harmonic function is also harmonic, the Poisson kernel carries over to the upper half-plane. In this case, the Poisson integral equation takes the form\n\nThe kernel itself is given by\n\nGiven a function formula_7, the \"L\" space of integrable functions on the real line, \"u\" can be understood as a harmonic extension of \"f\" into the upper half-plane. In analogy to the situation for the disk, when \"u\" is holomorphic in the upper half-plane, then \"u\" is an element of the Hardy space, formula_8 and in particular,\n\nThus, again, the Hardy space \"H\" on the upper half-plane is a Banach space, and, in particular, its restriction to the real axis is a closed subspace of formula_10 The situation is only analogous to the case for the unit disk; the Lebesgue measure for the unit circle is finite, whereas that for the real line is not.\n\nFor the ball of radius formula_11 the Poisson kernel takes the form\n\nwhere formula_13 (the surface of formula_14), and formula_15 is the surface area of the unit (\"n\"−1)-sphere.\n\nThen, if \"u\"(\"x\") is a continuous function defined on \"S\", the corresponding Poisson integral is the function \"P\"[\"u\"](\"x\") defined by\n\nIt can be shown that \"P\"[\"u\"](\"x\") is harmonic on the ball formula_14 and that \"P\"[\"u\"](\"x\") extends to a continuous function on the closed ball of radius \"r\", and the boundary function coincides with the original function \"u\".\n\nAn expression for the Poisson kernel of an upper half-space can also be obtained. Denote the standard Cartesian coordinates of R by\nThe upper half-space is the set defined by\nThe Poisson kernel for \"H\" is given by\nwhere\n\nThe Poisson kernel for the upper half-space appears naturally as the Fourier transform of the Abel kernel\nin which \"t\" assumes the role of an auxiliary parameter. To wit,\nIn particular, it is clear from the properties of the Fourier transform that, at least formally, the convolution\nis a solution of Laplace's equation in the upper half-plane. One can also show that as \"t\" → 0, \"P\"[\"u\"](\"t\",\"x\") → \"u\"(\"x\") in a suitable sense.\n\n\n"}

The other was the Perth constituency.\n\nPrior to the 1918 election the county of Kinross was covered, nominally, by Clackmannanshire and Kinross-shire, which also covered, nominally, the county of Clackmannan, and the county of Perth was covered, nominally, by Eastern Perthshire, Perth (as a burgh constituency) and Western Perthshire. Constituency boundaries were defined in terms of the Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1832 and the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 and, by these terms, five detached parishes of the county of Perth and one detached parish of the county of Stirling were within the Clackmannanshire and Kinross-shire constituency. Also, by 1918, for local government purposes, under legislation dating from 1889, county boundaries throughout most of Scotland had been redrawn, and detached parishes had become generally historic.\n\nThe Representation of the People Act 1918 took account of new local government boundaries in definitions of new constituency boundaries, and the Kinross and Western Perthshire constituency was defined as covering the county of Kinross and the Central, Highland and Western districts of the county of Perth, including the county of Perth burghs of Aberfeldy, Auchterarder, Callander, Crieff, Doune and Dunblane.\n\n1918 boundaries were used also for the general elections of 1922, 1923, 1924, 1929, 1931, 1935 and 1945.\n\nA by-election was held for this seat in 1938 after The Duchess of Atholl resigned her seat in opposition to Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement.\n\nFor the 1950 general election, as a result of the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949, the Perth constituency became Perth and East Perthshire, but boundaries were unaltered. 1950 names and boundaries were used also for the general elections of 1951, 1955, 1959, 1964, 1966 and 1970. This also applied to the by-election of late 1963, when newly elected prime minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home won the seat after renouncing his peerage in order to rejoin the House of Commons.\n\nFor the February 1974 general election, as a result of the Second Periodical Review of the Boundary Commission, there were minor alterations to the boundaries of the Kinross and West Perthshire constituency and the Perth and East Perthshire constituency. Kinross and West Perthshire was defined as covering the county of Kinross and the Central, Highland and Western districts of the county of Perth, including the county of Perth burghs of Aberfeldy, Auchterarder, Callander, Crieff, Doune, Dunblane and Pitlochry.\n\nFebruary 1974 boundaries were used also in the general elections of October 1974 and 1979.\n\nIn 1975, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, counties and burghs throughout Scotland had been abolished in favour of regions and districts and islands council areas. The county of Kinross and most of the county of Perth had been merged into the Tayside region. The burghs of Callander, Doune, and Dunblane in the county of Perth, the Perth parish of Muckhart and the Western district of the county (except the electoral division of Ardoch) had been merged into the Central region.\n\nNew constituency boundaries, taking account of new local government boundaries, were adopted for the 1983 general election.

{"id": "2214599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214599", "title": "Direct reference theory", "text": "Direct reference theory\n\nA direct reference theory (also called referentialism or referential realism) is a theory of language that claims that the meaning of a word or expression lies in what it points out in the world. The object denoted by a word is called its referent. Criticisms of this position are often associated with Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\nIn the 19th century, mathematician and philosopher Gottlob Frege argued against it, and contrasted it with mediated reference theory. In 1953, with his \"Philosophical Investigations\", Wittgenstein argued against referentialism, famously saying that \"the meaning of a word is its use.\" Direct reference theory is a position typically associated with logical positivism and analytical philosophy. Logical positivist philosophers in particular have significantly devoted their efforts in countering positions of the like of Wittgenstein's, and they aim at creating a \"perfectly descriptive language\" purified from ambiguities and confusions.\n\nThe philosopher John Stuart Mill was one of the earliest modern advocates of a direct reference theory beginning in 1843. In his \"A System of Logic\" Mill introduced a distinction between what he called \"connotation\" and \"denotation.\" Connotation is a relation between a name (singular or general) and one or more attributes. For example, ‘widow’ denotes widows and connotes the attributes of being female, and of having been married to someone now dead. If a name is connotative, it denotes what it denotes in virtue of object or objects having the attributes the name connotes. Connotation thus determines denotation. The same object can, on the other hand, be denoted with several names with different connotations. A name can have connotation but no denotation. Connotation of a name, if it has one, can be taken to be its meaning in Mill.\n\nAccording to Mill, most individual concrete names are connotative, but some, namely proper names, are not. In other words, proper names do not have meaning. All general terms, on the other hand, are according to Mill connotative. In sum, Mill's overall picture resembles very much the description theory of reference, though his take on proper names is an exception.\n\nSaul Kripke, a proponent of direct reference theory, in his \"Naming and Necessity\" dubbed mediated reference theory the \"Frege–Russell view\" and criticized it (see below). Subsequent scholarship refuted the claim that Bertrand Russell's views on reference theory were the same as Gottlob Frege's, since Russell was also a proponent of direct reference theory.\n\nSaul Kripke defended direct reference theory when applied to proper names. Kripke claims that proper names do not have any \"senses\" at all, because senses only offer contingent facts about things. Ruth Barcan Marcus advanced a theory of direct reference for proper names at a symposium in which Quine and Kripke were participants: published in \"Synthese\", 1961 with Discussion in \"Synthese\" 1962. She called directly referring proper names \"tags\" (see tag theory of names). Kripke urged such a theory in 1971 and thereafter. He called such directly referring proper names \"rigid designators\".\n\nKripke articulated this view using the formal apparatus of possible worlds. The possible worlds thought-experiment first takes the subject, and then tries to imagine the subject in other possible worlds. Taking George W. Bush, for example. First (1) the thought-experiment must state that the name \"George W. Bush\" is the name used to describe the particular individual man that is typically meant. Then (2), the experimenter must imagine the possible states of affairs that reality could have been - where Bush was not president, or went into a different career, was never born at all, etc. When this is done, it becomes obvious that the phrase \"President of the United States in 2004\" does not necessarily describe George W. Bush, because it is not necessarily true in all possible worlds; it only contingently describes him. By contrast, for instance, the word \"apple\" will always describe the same things across all possible worlds, because of premise (1). So use of the word \"apple\" to describe apples is true in all possible worlds.\n\nTerms that are true across all possible worlds in this way are called \"rigid designators\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2214600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214600", "title": "Cryptocarya", "text": "Cryptocarya\n\nCryptocarya is a genus of evergreen trees belonging to the laurel family, Lauraceae. The genus includes more than 350 species, distributed through the Neotropical, Afrotropical, Indomalayan, and Australasian realms.\n\nThe genus includes species of evergreen trees, distributed mostly in tropical and subtropical regions of South America, Mauritius, India, China, Java, New Guinea, and Africa, seven species in Southern Africa.\n\nCommon in the canopy, they grow up to 60 m, or as subcanopy trees in the succession climax species in tropical, lower temperate, or subtropical broadleaved forests. They are found in low-elevation evergreen forests and littoral rainforests, on all type of soils. The seeds are readily dispersed by fruit-eating birds, and seedlings and saplings have been recorded from other habitats where they are unlikely to develop to maturity.\n\nThe genus name \"Cryptocarya\" is from a Greek word \"krypto\" meaning to hide, \"karya\" meaning a walnut tree, the fruit of which was known as \"karyon\", a word also used to describe other fruits. Sometimes, they are called mountain laurels or mountain walnuts. The fruit are succulent, partially immersed in a deep, thick cup.\n\nIn a recent generic classification of Lauraceae based on DNA sequence, \"Cryptocarya\" was found to be part of a strongly supported clade that also includes \"Beilschmiedia, Potameia, Endiandra\" and \"Aspidostemon\".\n\nThe ecological requirements of the genus are those of the laurel forest, mostly from the tropics or warmer temperate areas, and like most of their counterparts laurifolia in the world, they are vigorous species with a great ability to populate conducive habitats. The natural habitat of most of species are in rainforest which are cloud-covered for much of the year. These species are found in forests that face threats of destruction by human deforestation. Some species are in danger of extinction due to loss of habitat.\n\"Cryptocarya\" is a genus of great ecological importance. It is present in low rainforest and montane rainforest, laurel forest, in the weed-tree forests in valleys, and mixed forests of coniferous and deciduous broad-leaved trees.\nThe differences are ecological adaptations to different environments over a relatively dry-wet and a warmer to mild frost (-2 °C) in temperate climate growing in cooler regions, subject to frost and occasional snow. Species in less-humid environments are smaller or less robust, with less abundant and thinner foliage and have oleifera cells that give trees a more fragrant aroma.\nThe most known trees are used by the timber industry. In this genus, the wood of some species has high commercial value.\n\nThe species forming this genus share a unique paniculate inflorescence with the ultimate divisions that are not quite cymose; that is, the lateral flowers of what looks like a cyme are not strictly opposite, but tend to be subopposite, while in most genera of Lauraceae with paniculate inflorescences the lateral flowers in a cyme are strictly opposite.\n\n\"Cryptocarya\" has always been considered closely related to \"Ravensara\", and is also related to the \"Beilschmiedia\" clade and that, based on the presence of fruit included in the enlarged hypanthium, it is yet most closely related to \"Aspidostemon\", through the similarity in fruit structure; in both \"Aspidostemon \" and \"Cryptocarya\", the fruit are enclosed in the enlarged hypanthium, but this might be a parallel development and not a signal of common ancestry.\nThe fruit, a drupe, is an important food source for birds, usually from specialized genera. Birds eat the whole fruit and regurgitate seeds intact, expanding the seeds in the best conditions for germination (ornitochory). In some species, seed dispersal is carried out by mammals.\n\nThe Chilean \"Cryptocarya alba\" and the Australian \"C. erythroxylon\" and \"C. foveolata\" of the mountains of New South Wales are outstanding for their frost tolerance within a genus having its majority of species growing in tropical climate.\n\"Cryptocarya woodii\" flowers in November with small inconspicuous flowers. These small flowers develop into round, shiny, purple-black fruits. This tree has a very hard brown wood.\n\"C. alba\", the peumo, the most common evergreen tree in the Chilean Matorral ecoregion of central Chile, produces edible reddish fruits and is the most known species in the Northern Hemisphere. \"C. massoy\" is used commercially to produce essential oils. \"C. woodii\" leaves have been found in prehistoric settlements in Africa and are believed to have been used for insect control.\n\n\n"}

The reaction is named after Fritz Ullmann.\n\nThe mechanism of the Ullmann reaction is extensively studied. Complications arise because the reactions are often heterogeneous, especially those starting with metallic copper. Radical intermediates are not observed by Electron spin resonance. Oxidative addition/reductive elimination sequence seem likely, but perhaps in one-electron steps in some cases. Copper(III) has been rarely observed but is increasingly invoked in this area of catalysis. Initial organocopper intermediates are speculated to be the copper(I) species ArCu and CuX or the copper(II) species ArCuX (other ligands omitted).\n\nA typical example of classic Ullmann biaryl coupling is the conversion of \"ortho\"-chloronitrobenzene into 2,2'-dinitrobiphenyl with a copper - bronze alloy.\n\nThe traditional version of the Ullmann reaction requires harsh reaction conditions, and the reaction has a reputation for erratic yields. Because of these problems many improvements and alternative procedures have been introduced.\n\nThe classical Ullmann reaction is limited to electron deficient aryl halides and requires harsh reaction conditions. Modern variants of the Ullman reaction employing palladium and nickel have widened the substrate scope of the reaction and rendered reaction conditions more mild. Yields are generally still moderate, however. In organic synthesis this reaction is often replaced by palladium coupling reactions such as the Heck reaction, the Hiyama coupling, and the Sonogashira coupling.\n\nBiphenylenes had been obtained before with reasonable yields using 2,2-diiodobiphenyl or 2,2-diiodobiphenylonium ion as starting material.\n\nClosure of 5-membered ring are more favorable more facile, but larger rings have also been made using this approach.\n\nUllmann synthesis of biaryl compounds can be used to generate chiral products from chiral reactants. Nelson and collaborators worked on the synthesis of asymmetric biaryl compounds and obtained the thermodynamically controlled product.\n\nThe diastereometric ratio of the products is enhanced with bulkier R groups in the auxiliary oxazoline group.\n\nUnsymmetrical Ullmann reactions are rarely pursued but have been achieved when one of the two coupling components is in excess.\n\n"}

{"id": "2214623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214623", "title": "LNCaP", "text": "LNCaP\n\nLNCaP cells are a cell line of human cells commonly used in the field of oncology. LNCaP cells are androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma cells derived from the left supraclavicular lymph node metastasis from a 50-year-old caucasian male in 1977. They are adherent epithelial cells growing in aggregates and as single cells.\n\nOne major obstacle to the conducting the most clinically relevant prostate cancer (PCa) research has been the lack of cell lines that closely mimic human disease progression. Two hallmarks of metastatic human prostate cancer include the shift of aggressive PCa from androgen-sensitivity to an Androgen Insensitive (AI) state, and the propensity of PCa to metastasize to bone. Although the generation of AI cell lines has been quite successful as demonstrated in the “classic” cell lines DU145 and PC3, the behavior of these cells in bone does not fully mimic clinical human disease. It is well established that human PCa bone metastasis form osteoblastic lesions rather than osteolytic lesions seen in other cancers like breast cancer. Similarly, PC-3 and DU145 cells form osteolytic tumors. To develop an AI-PCa cell model that more closely mimics clinical disease, LNCaP sublines have been generated to provide the most clinically relevant tissue culture tools to date.\n\nThe LNCaP cell line was established from a metastatic lesion of human prostatic adenocarcinoma. The LNCaP cells grow readily in vitro (up to 8 x 10 cells/sq cm; doubling time, 60 hr), form clones and are highly resistant to human fibroblast interferon. LNCaP cells have a modal chromosome number of 76 to 91, indicative of a human male karyotype with several marker chromosomes. The malignant properties of LNCaP cells are maintained in athymic nude mice which develop tumors at the injection site and show a similar doubling time \"in vivo\".\n\nHigh-affinity specific androgen and estrogen receptors are present in the cytosol and nuclear fractions. The LNCaP line is hormonally responsive, shown by \"in vitro\" 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone modulation of cell growth and acid phosphatase production. LNCaP cells also express Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA). \"In vivo\", Male mice develop tumors earlier and at a greater frequency than do females and hormonal manipulations show that the frequency of tumor development correlates with serum androgen levels. The rate of the tumor growth, however, is independent of the gender or hormonal status of the host.\n\nWu et al. (1994) reproduced the human-derived LNCaP tumors in immunocompromised mice by co-injection of LNCaP cells with MS human bone fibroblasts. Cells were subcutaneously injected at multiple sites into the mouse flank and after approximately 4 weeks of growth, tumors were easily detectable by physical examination and had a high rate of growth (17-33 mm3/day).\n\nTo replicate the hallmark shift of PCa cells to AI, LNCaP host mice were castrated by way of midscrotal incision at approximately 8 weeks post injection. Tumors were maintained in castrated hosts for 4 to 5 weeks at which time remaining tumors were harvested. In total, two subsets of cells were collected from castrated hosts: C4 and C5, collected at 4 and 5 weeks respectively.\n\nTo further select for AI-PCa cells, the C4 subline was co-injected with MS human fibroblasts into a castrated host. The resulting tumors were isolated and an additional subline was generated, C4-2.\n\nKaryotype comparisons indicate that\nLNCaP cells grown in intact hosts (M subline) have a modal chromosomal distribution number of 83, C4 and C5 sublines with 85, and the C4-2 subline with 83.\n\nTo further verify that these cells were of human origin karyotype analysis determined that the parental LNCaP cells had 7 distinct marker chromosomes, with two copies of each. The M, C4, C5, and C4-2 sublines contained most of the marker chromosomes, with the M subline being most similar to the parental LNCaP cells. C4, C5 and C4-2 are only minutely distinct from LNCaP and the M subline with the addition of a marker chromosome resulting from a segment addition to chromosome 6. A Y chromosome is not present in most C4, C5 and C4-2 cells, suggesting major chromosomal alterations.\n\nC4, C5, and C4-2 sublines grow well under identical tissue culture conditions as LNCaP with similar growth rates. Parental LNCaP, M, C4, and C5 subline have similar baseline gene expression levels of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) however, M, C4, and C5 sublines express 5-10X more PSA mRNA. M, C4, C5 and C4-2 also expressed reduced human androgen receptor mRNA as expected in AI cells.\n\nAndrogen Insensitivity\nAll sublines were treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a high-affinity ligand for AR. DHT treatment elicited markedly reduced growth in C4 and C5 cells and no growth in C4-2 cells when compared to the high rate of growth seen in LNCaP cells, suggesting reduced androgen sensitivity in C4 and C5 and AI in C4-2 cells. Whole-cell AR assay also indicated that LNCaP cells have a much higher affinity form of AR (Kd = 159 pM) when compared to C4-2 (Kd = 267 pM).\n\nTumorigenicity\nC4 and C5 sublines exhibit greatly increased tumorigenicity when injected in intact male mice, unlike parental LNCaP cells. C4 and C5 were also able to form highly vascularized carcinomas in castrated mice when co-injected with MS human fibroblasts. The C4-2 subline more readily forms tumors in intact hosts than C4 and C5 sublines and they are the only cells able to form tumors in castrated host without co-injection of MS human bone fibroblasts. These same C4-2 tumors stained for PSA and secreted high levels of PSA into the growth medium.\n\nTo generate a bone metastatic subline, C4-2 cells were orthotopically injected into castrated male mice. These cells formed large primary tumors of the prostate, lymph nodes, as well as osseus tumors. Isolation of these osseus tumors resulted in the C4-2B subline.\nC4-2B cells were positive for PSA and cytokeratin 8, confirming their prostatic origin. Most importantly, immunohistochemical staining of the C4-2B tumors were positive for osteoblast activity suggesting the induction of osteoblastic tumor formation mirroring the progression of human PCa.\n\nWhen cultured in a “promineralization medium” that contains ascorbic acid (known to promote skeletal-like ECM formation in osteoblasts) and a source of phosphate (for hydroxyapatite formation), C4-2B cells produce and retain approximately 8x more mineralized calcium than parental LNCaP cells. C4-2B cells also express higher levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG), alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein (BSP), Osteocalcin (OCN), RANKL, and Osteonectin (OSN) mRNA, all of which are highly expressed by osteoblasts.\nOsteoblast promoter activity is also higher in C4-2B cells when compared to LNCaP, as indicated by Cbfa1 transcription factor expression. Concomitantly, BMP7, a known inducer of Cbfa1, is also more highly expressed in C4-2B cells, further suggesting many osteoblast-like properties.\n\nLN95 cells were derived from LNCaP cultured in RPMI-1640 (without phenol red) with 10% charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum. LN95 cells differ from parental LNCaP cells morphologically, with pronounced dendritic extensions, and molecularly, with Androgen receptor variant expression similar to that of AR-V7 VCaP cells. Notably, LN95 cells are significantly more tumour initiating than their parental counterparts \"in vivo\".\n\nLNCaP-AI (or LN-AI) cells were derived from 6-Month culture of LNCaP parental cells in charcoal stripped serum. While LNCaP-AI are wholly androgen independent, they retain high expression of Androgen receptor, low expression of AR-V7, and remain androgen responsive. The mechanism of the highly proliferative phenotype of LNCaP-AI cells appears to be loss of cell cycle regulator expression (p21, p16) and increased anti-apoptotic Bcl2 expression.\n\n"}

By 2010, Koha has been translated from its original English into French, Chinese, Arabic and several other languages. Support for the cataloguing and search standards MARC and Z39.50 was added in 2002 and later sponsored by the Athens County Public Libraries. In France Paul Poulain co-founded BibLibre in 2007.\n\nIn 2005, an Ohio-based company, Metavore, Inc., trading as LibLime, was established to support Koha and added many new features, including support for Zebra sponsored by the Crawford County Federated Library System. Zebra support increased the speed of searches as well as improving scalability to support tens of millions of bibliographic records.\n\nIn 2007 a group of libraries in Vermont began testing the use of Koha for Vermont libraries. At first a separate implementation was created for each library. Then the Vermont Organization of Koha Automated Libraries (VOKAL) was organized to create one database to be used by libraries. This database was rolled out in 2011. Fifty-seven libraries have chosen to adopt Koha and moved to the shared production environment hosted and supported by ByWater Solutions. Another consortium of libraries in Vermont, the Catamount Library Network has also adopted Koha (also hosted by ByWater Solutions). Previously automated Vermont libraries used software from Follett, or other commercial software vendors.\n\nIn 2010 the King's Fund, supported by PTFS Europe completed their migration to Koha after an extensive feasibility study.\n\nIn 2011 the Spanish Ministry of Culture maintains KOBLI, a tailored version of Koha based on an earlier report.\n\nIn 2014 the Ministry of Culture (Turkey) started to use Koha -- Devinim version in 1,136 public libraries with more than 17,000,000 items and app. 2,000,000 active users. This is the biggest Koha installation for the moment. \n\nIncreasingly, specialized libraries such as music libraries, adopt Koha, as its open-source nature offers easier pathways to customization for their particular usecases. \n\n\nIn 2009 a dispute arose between LibLime and other members of the Koha community. The dispute centred on LibLime's apparent reluctance to be inclusive with the content of the sites and the non-contribution of software patches back to the community. A number of participants declared that they believed that LibLime had forked the software and the community. A separate web presence, source code repository and community was established. The fork continued after March 2010, when LibLime was purchased by PTFS.\n\nIn November, 2011, LibLime announced they had been granted a provisional trademark on the use of the name \"koha\" in New Zealand by Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand. The provisional trademark grant was successfully appealed by the Koha community as well as by Catalyst, with a decision handed down in December 2013 and with Liblime to pay costs.\n\nKoha is currently a very active project.
