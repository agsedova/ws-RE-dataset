{"id": "2172684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172684", "title": "Sabre (fencing)", "text": "Sabre (fencing)\n\nThe sabre (US English: \"saber\", both pronounced ) is one of the three disciplines of modern fencing. The sabre weapon is for thrusting and cutting with both the cutting edge and the back of the blade (unlike other modern fencing weapons, the épée and foil, where the methods of making a hit are scored using the point of the blade).\n\nThe informal term sabreur refers to a male fencer who follows the discipline; sabreuse is the female equivalent.\n\n\"The blade, which must be of steel, is approximately rectangular in section. The maximum length of the blade is 88 cm. The minimum width of the blade, which must be at the button, is 4 mm; its thickness, also immediately below the button, must be at least 1.2 mm.\" \n\nThe cross-sectional profile of the sabre blade is commonly a V-shaped base which transitions to a flat rectangular shaped end with most blade variants, however this is dependent on the how it is manufactured. This allows the blade to be flexible towards the end. According to regulation, manufacturers must acknowledge that the blade must be fixed horizontally at a point 70 cm (27.5591 in) from the tip of the blade.\n\nStandardised Adult (size 5) blades are 88 cm (34.6457 in) in length. (excluding other components). At the end of the blade, the point is folded over itself to form a \"button\" which, when viewed end on, must have a square or rectangular section of 4 mm - 6 mm no larger or smaller. The button must not be any more than 3 mm from the end of the 88 cm blade section.\n\nThe guard is full in shape, made in one piece and is externally smooth, the curvature of the guard is continuous without any aesthetic perforations or rims. The interior of the guard is fully insulated by either paint or a pad. The guard is designed to provide the hand adequate protection to ensure that injury does not occur which may hinder the performance of the fencer. Guards are dimensionally measured 15 cm by 14 cm in section where the blade is parallel with the axis of the gauge.\n\nOn electrical sabres, a socket for the body wire is found underneath the bell guard. A fastener known as a pommel is attached to the end of the sword to keep the bell guard and handle on, it electrically separates the handle and the guard.\n\nThe conventional handle of the sabre is shaped so that it may be held so that the hand may slide down to gain further extension of the weapon relative to the fencer. Other grips which form various shapes are incompatible and impractical with sabre as they limit the movement of the hand, and are likely to be ergonomically incompatible with the guard.\n\nThe entire weapon is generally 105 cm (41 inches) long; the maximum weight is 500g, but most competition swords are closer to 400g. It is shorter than the foil or épée, and lighter than the épée, hence physically easier to move swiftly and decisively. However the integrity of the sabre blade is not as strong as other weapons as it is more likely to break due to the design.\n\nLike other weapons used in fencing, the modern sabre uses an electrical connection to register touches. The sabreur wears a lamé, a conductive jacket, to complete the circuit and register a touch to a valid target.\n\nSabre was the last weapon in fencing to make the transition over to using electrical equipment. This occurred in 1988, 32 years after foil and 52 years after the épée. In 2004, immediately following the Athens Summer Olympics, the timing for recording a touch was shortened from its previous setting, dramatically altering the sport and method in which a touch is scored.\n\nUnlike the other two weapons, there is very little difference between an electric sabre and a steam or dry (non-electric) one. The blade itself is the same in steam and electric sabres, as there is no need for a blade wire or pressure-sensitive tip in an electric sabre. An electric sabre has a socket, which is generally a 2-prong or bayonet foil socket with the two contacts shorted together. The electric sabre also has insulation on the pommel and on the inside of the guard to prevent an electrical connection between the sabre and the lamé. This is undesirable because it effectively extends the lamé onto the sabre, causing any blade contact to be registered as a valid touch.\n\nEarly electric sabres were equipped with a capteur socket. The capteur was a small mechanical accelerometer that was intended to distinguish between a good cut and a mere touch of the blade against the target. In November 2019 the FIE announced their intention to re-introduce the capteur to sabre using modern accelerometer technology. \n\nThe general target area for the discipline contains the entire torso above the waist, the head, and the arms up to the wrist of which a valid hit may be scored. The legs, hand and feet are excluded from the target area.\n\nA single circuit for the entire target area used in scoring systems is formed by multiple conductive equipment:\n\n\nBecause touches can be scored using the edge of the blade, there is no need for a pressure-sensitive head to be present on the end of the blade (thus having the button). When fencing \"electric\" (as opposed to \"steam\" or \"dry\") a current runs through the sabre blade. When the blade comes into contact with the lamé, the electrical mask, or the manchette, the current flows through the body cord and interacts with the scoring equipment.\n\nAlso known as the 'Scoring apparatus' or Box.\n\nAs for all electrical apparatus used in modern fencing, the referee's final judgement be aided by the apparatus taking into account of possible failure. Most sabre hits are registered by light signals (red and green distinguishable for each fencer) placed on top of the sabre apparatus and accompanied by audible signal(s) consisting of either of a short ring, or of a continuous note limited to two seconds.\n\nIn some circumstances a white signal is indicated when a fencer has hit off-target.\n\nThe 'Lockout Period', an informal term to describe the minimum amount of time between registered touches respective of the target area. This period is set into the electrical apparatus to aid judgement.\n\nRecent regulation adjustments to the 'functioning times of the scoring apparatuses' following from the 2016 Olympic games modified the registering times from \"120\" \"ms (± 10 ms)\" to \"170 ms (± 10 ms) .\" Scoring apparatuses with the new modification are marked with a \"2 × 4\" \"cm,\" magenta identification label. Bearing in black text : 'FIE 2016'.\n\nChanging the lockout timing effectively changed the way with which the sabre was fenced, making it faster with greater emphasis on footwork. Although the essential nature of the game would remain the same, the strategies for attack and defense would need to be rethought.\n\nThe timing change was initially greeted with a degree of controversy, as many fencers were accustomed to having the longer timings. This made the techniques then employed vulnerable to fast stop-cuts (a hit made by the defender that lands whilst the attacker is still beginning an attack, also known as a skyhook) or remisés (a second attack made by the original attacker after the first has technically finished). It was commonly regarded that the shorter timings would only encourage poor technique and an \"attack only\" mentality, negating much of the art of the sport.\n\nRemises and stop-cuts would not normally score a point as a hit by the attacker would take priority. However the hit made with priority may arrive too late under the shorter timings to register, and so the stop-cuts and remises would indeed score.\n\nAs a result of the narrower timings, the efficacy of attacks into preparation was increased, meaning that it was now more critical that the preparing fencer must already have begun an attack by the time the two fencers were in hitting distance of each other.\n\nThe techniques of how to parry and riposte have been extended. The solid parries, used extensively before the change of timings, would be supplemented by an additional step back by the defender to avoid the attacker remising (continuing to push their blade after their attack has technically done) or else the defence to be performed as a beat-attack, an extending arm that deflects the oncoming attack halfway through the extension before hitting the original attacker's target area.\n\nWith hindsight, the shorter timings seem to have encouraged a tightening and refinement of the original techniques with smaller, neater moves so that, on the whole, sabre fencing became faster and more precise than it had ever been before.\n\nWhen both signals indicate, it rests upon the referee to decide which fencer scores the point. The decision is based on the concept of Right of Way which gives the point to the fencer who had priority, i.e. the attacking fencer. As with foil, the other right of way weapon, priority is gained in many ways, which can be broken down into active, passive, and defensive categories:\n\n\nIf neither fencer has 'right of way' in a double touch situation (typically, if both initiate the attack simultaneously in so far as the director can determine), the action is called a \"simultaneous attack\" and no point is awarded unless an attack is initiated first and is not parried or missed.\n\nRight of way rules were initially established to encourage fencers to use parries and other techniques in order to hit without being hit, as they would logically desire to do if they were using sharp swords. Subsequently, the rules of right of way have been altered simply to keep the strategy and technique of sabre interesting and (relatively) easy to understand.\n\nThe referee may halt the action for reasons such as a safety hazard, fencer injury, or violation of the rules. When the referee says \"halt\", no further action may score a point. For cases of rules violations, the referee may choose to either warn the offender or show him or her a penalty card. A warning has no scoring implication. Cards, on the other hand, have further penalties:\n\nAt sabre, it is generally easier to attack than to defend (for example, the timing favours remises) and high-level international sabre fencing is often very fast and very simple, although when required, top sabreurs do display an extended repertoire of tactical devices. In response to the relatively high speed of sabre fencing (sabre is the fastest sport in the world combat wise), the rules for sabre were changed to prohibit the forward cross-over (where the back foot passes the front foot) - it is now a cardable offence. Thus, the flèche attack is no longer permissible, so sabre fencers have instead begun to use a \"flunge\" (flying lunge). This attack begins like a flèche, but the fencer pushes off from the ground and moves quickly forward, attempting to land a hit before their feet cross over. Similarly, \"running attacks\" — consisting of a failed flèche followed by continuous remises — have also been eliminated.\n\nSabre defense comprises the three primary parries:\nand three secondary parries:\n\nAnother parry, lesser-known, but which works against opponents of the same handedness, is referred to as \"the Hungarian\". This parry is most useful when both fencers charge off the line towards each other. To perform the Hungarian, a fencer throws a \"prime\" parry when the opponent is within striking distance and sweeps upward into a \"quinte\" position, covering (in the process) nearly all target area, and performs the riposte as with a normal \"quinte\" parry. The Hungarian technique often works best if a step or angle is taken in the opposite direction of the \"prime\" parry. This technique will not work with two fencers of opposite handedness.\n\nIt follows from the nature of sabre parries (they block an incoming attack rather than deflecting it as in foil and épée) that they are static and must be taken as late as possible to avoid being duped by a feint attack, committing to a parry in the wrong line and being unable to change parry (which often involves completely altering the orientation of the blade while moving and rotating the wrist and forearm) to defend against the real attack quickly enough.\n\nCircles, such as Circle 3, 4, and 5, defend against stabs to the body, which an ordinary parry would not block. This is extremely useful, as it is highly versatile, covering much of the target area.\n\nEach fencing weapon has a different tempo, and the tempo for épée and foil is rather slow with sudden bursts of speed. Sabre is fast throughout the entire touch. However, many coaches are urging pupils to slow down the pace by taking smaller steps instead of larger ones.\n\n\n"}

He engaged in politics as a socialist before turning to anarchism in 1888.\n\nIn 1894, he was prosecuted in \"The Trial of the thirty\" (\"Procès des trente\"), but was acquitted. In 1895, he cofounded \"\"Le Libertaire\"\" with Louise Michel, taking the name of the earlier journal by Joseph Déjacque. At the time of the Dreyfus affair, he was one of the leading supporters of Alfred Dreyfus. In 1904, he created a libertarian school called \"\"La Ruche\"\" (The Hive) close to Rambouillet. In 1916, he launched the periodical \"\"Ce qu'il faut dire\"\". Faure also co-founded (with Voline) the Synthesis, or also known as synthesis anarchism which was an influential form of conceiving anarchist federations.\n\nIn 1918, he was imprisoned for organizing an illegal meeting. He is recognized for his pedagogy and his qualities as a speaker, and is the author of several books:\n\n\nHe was also the founder of the Anarchist encyclopedia, as well as the namesake of the Sébastien Faure Century, the French-speaking contingent of the Durruti Column during the civil war in Spain.\n\nThe discussion about the Anarchist Synthesis arises in the context of the discussion on the Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists, written by the Dielo Truda group of Russian exiles in 1926.\n\nTwo texts made as responses to the Platform, each proposing a different organizational model, became the basis for what is known as the organisation of synthesis, or simply \"synthesism\".\nVoline published in 1924 a paper calling for \"the anarchist synthesis\" and was also the author of the article in Sébastien Faure's \"Encyclopedie Anarchiste\" on the same topic. The main purpose behind the synthesis was that the anarchist movement in most countries was divided into three main tendencies: communist anarchism, anarcho-syndicalism, and individualist anarchism and so such an organization could contain anarchists of these three tendencies very well.\n\nThe platformists wanted to push their ideas forward through organizing an international anarchist congress on 12 February 1927. Shortly later in the National Congress of the French Anarchist Union (UAF), the Dielo Truda Group achieved making their platform more popular and so they made the UAF change its name into Revolutionary Anarcho-Communist Union (UACR). Sébastien Faure led a faction within the UACR that decided to separate themselves from this organization and form outside it the Association of Federalist Anarchists (AFA), thinking that traditional anarchist ideas were being threatened by the Dielo Truda platform. Shortly later in his text \"Anarchist synthesis\" he exposes the view that \"these currents were not contradictory but complementary, each having a role within anarchism: anarcho-syndicalism as the strength of the mass organisations and the best way for the practice of anarchism; libertarian communism as a proposed future society based on the distribution of the fruits of labour according to the needs of each one; anarcho-individualism as a negation of oppression and affirming the individual right to development of the individual, seeking to please them in every way. Sebastian Faure had strong contacts in Spain and so his proposal had more impact with Spanish anarchists than the Dielo Truda platform even though individualist anarchist influence in Spain was less strong than it was in France. The main goal there was reconciling anarcho-communism with anarcho-syndicalism.\n\nFaure's view of pedagogy was that every single aspect of a human being had to be developed. Faure identified three aspects: physical, mental and moral. He thought that a man or a woman needed to be able to accomplish physical, manual tasks as well as to have a minimum of culture and think and be able to develop ideas. All this in a respectful, mutual, equal and free environment.\n\nCreated in 1904, the source of capital for La Ruche (The Hive) at the beginning was the product of Faure's seminars. It became self-sufficient in three years' time. Its founding principles were similar to Proudhon's Permanent Education and Paul Robin's \"good birth, good education and good social organisation.\"\n\nThe three main spheres of pedagogy were fulfilled through classes, work in the field and all the different activities necessary to ensure the self-sufficiency of the Hive. The moral values were implemented through respect of the child's autonomy, positive method, absence of ranking or any form of categorization (except some activities were reserved to particular groups of age), coeducation, and sexual education (all activities being mixed.)\n\n\n\n"}

He gained fame for his songwriting abilities when he penned his 2004 hit \"Let Me Love You\" for singer Mario. The single's successful release in the United States prompted an informal meeting between Ne-Yo and Def Jam's label head and the signing of a recording contract.\n\nNe-Yo's debut solo single, \"Stay\", was released in 2005 to moderate success. His debut studio album, \"In My Own Words\" (2006), was critically and commercially successful, reaching number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart in the United States. It is certified platinum in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan and Australia and saw the success of the single \"So Sick\", which topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in the United States.\n\n\"Because of You\" (2007), Ne-Yo's second studio album, was the second number one platinum-selling album debuted on the \"Billboard\" 200 and Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts, and received the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album at the 50th Grammy Awards. His third studio album, \"Year of the Gentleman\" (2008), saw continued success and further Grammy Award nominations for Best Contemporary R&B Album as well as Album of the Year. Its singles \"Closer\" and \"Miss Independent\" were also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, Best Male R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song. \"Year of the Gentleman\" has been certified platinum twice in the US, selling two million copies, also platinum three times in the UK and once in Japan.\n\n\"Libra Scale\" (2010), Ne-Yo's fourth studio album, reached number one in the UK R&B Singles and Albums Charts and number nine on the US \"Billboard\" 200, seeing a decline in overall sales. His fifth studio album, \"R.E.D.\" (2012), saw the international success of its lead single \"Let Me Love You (Until You Learn to Love Yourself)\", which certified platinum in the United States and sold over two million copies. Ne-Yo's sixth studio album, \"Non-Fiction\", followed in 2015. His seventh studio album, \"Good Man\", was released on June 8, 2018. In addition to music, Ne-Yo currently serves as judge for the reality competition series \"World of Dance\" alongside Jennifer Lopez and Derek Hough.\n\nShaffer Chimere Smith was born in Camden, Arkansas. His parents are both African-American. A DNA test showed Ne-Yo to be of 88.4% African and 10.1% European ancestry. His parents were musicians. As a young child, he was raised by his mother after she separated from his father. In hopes of better opportunity, his mother relocated the family to Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nWhile in the Las Vegas Academy, Smith adopted the stage name GoGo and joined an R&B group called Envy, who appeared during amateur night on \"Showtime at the Apollo\" and on the MTV's \"The Cut\" (hosted by Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes of TLC). The group disbanded in 2000, and Smith continued to write songs for other artists before starting his solo career. The stage name Ne-Yo was coined by Big D Evans, a producer with whom Ne-Yo once worked, because Evans claimed that Ne-Yo sees music like the character Neo sees the Matrix.\n\nAfter Envy disbanded in 2000, Columbia Records signed Ne-Yo, but the label dropped him before he could release his already-recorded first album. American singer Marques Houston happened to hear \"That Girl\", which Ne-Yo had planned to release as his debut single from his then-unreleased album. Houston re-recorded the song and released it as a single for his 2003 album \"MH\". The release of the song led to Ne-Yo being recognized as a top songwriter.\n\nFor the next two years, Ne-Yo continued writing songs, some of which have not been officially released. He contributed songs to American singer Teedra Moses's 2004 album \"Complex Simplicity\", Christina Milian's \"It's About Time\", and the American boy band Youngstown, none of which, however, brought Ne-Yo much mainstream attention. Ne-Yo has also contributed songs to singers Mary J. Blige, B2K, Faith Evans, and Musiq, among others.\n\nA breakthrough came when Ne-Yo wrote \"Let Me Love You\" for American singer Mario. The song reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and later stayed at the top spot for nine weeks. After the successful release, Tina Davis, former A&R representative for Def Jam Recordings, arranged an informal meeting with label head L.A. Reid. Despite not seeking a new contract at the time, then-CEO of Def Jam Jay Z signed Ne-Yo to a new deal after he performed for the label's executives.\n\nIn early 2006, Ne-Yo released his debut album, \"In My Own Words\", through Def Jam. Boosted by its popular second single \"So Sick\", the album debuted at number one on \"Billboard\" 200, selling over 301,000 copies in its first week on sale. During the same week, the single had reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Later singles released were \"When You're Mad\" and \"Sexy Love\", which peaked at number 15 and number seven, respectively. The album has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for a shipment of over one million units.\n\nHis second album, \"Because of You\", was released on May 1, 2007, and, fueled by its lead single, debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling 251,000 copies in the United States; the feat gave Ne-Yo his second number-one album. The first single from the platinum-selling album was the title track, which peaked at the number-two spot. Despite the success of \"Because of You\", later singles released charted lower and were unable to reach the Top 20. The album has been certified platinum by RIAA for a shipment of over one million units. In December 2007, Ne-Yo and the Goo Goo Dolls performed at a fund-raising concert for the then–presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama.\n\nNe-Yo's third album, \"Year of the Gentleman\", was released internationally on August 5, 2008. Speaking to noted UK R&B writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues & Soul, Ne-Yo explained the thinking behind its title: \"To me \"Year of the Gentleman\" is all about a persona, a swag and a charm. I made an assessment of the music business. And, in my personal opinion, the essence of the gentleman is absent right now. Everybody kinda looks the same, everybody's kinda doing the same thing, everybody's kinda rude and full of themselves. Whereas a gentleman is calm, courteous, kind, charming... So that title basically represents me trying to lead by example, and showing these cats what it is to be a gentleman in this business still.\"\n\nThe album sold 250,000 copies in its first week in the United States, debuting on the \"Billboard\" 200 at number two. Reviews for the album were positive: in one, Caryn Ganz of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine wrote that \"Year of the Gentleman\" is \"actually a superb concept album about what a great boyfriend he [Ne-Yo] can be\".\n\nThe first two singles, \"Closer\" and \"Miss Independent\", peaked at number seven on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The album was nominated for Best Contemporary R&B Album and Album of the Year at the 2009 Grammy Awards, \"Closer\" for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, and \"Miss Independent\" for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song. \"Year of the Gentleman\" has been certified platinum by RIAA for a shipment of more than one million copies. The third single, \"Mad\", peaked at number 11 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nOn August 12, 2008, the New Kids on the Block released \"Single\", the second single from their fifth studio album, \"The Block\", which is a duet with Ne-Yo. Ne-Yo included a solo version of the song on his album \"Year of the Gentleman\".\n\nIn December 2008, Ne-Yo performed at the Kennedy Center Honors as part of the tribute to Barbra Streisand; he sang and danced to the song \"Lover Come Back to Me\", which Streisand recorded on her second album in 1963.\n\nIn 2009, \"Billboard\" ranked him as the 57th Artist of the 2000s decade.\n\nOn September 2, 2009, Ne-Yo released greatest hits album \"\" in Japan. The album was also released with a limited edition CD+DVD edition complete with the music videos of singles. It debuted at number four on Japan's \"Oricon\" weekly albums chart, selling 55,625 copies in the first week.\n\nIn January 2010, Ne-Yo was featured in a duet with singer Mariah Carey titled \"Angels Cry\".\n\nIn June 2010, Ne-Yo released the single \"Beautiful Monster\", which became Ne-Yo's first number-one single on the UK Singles Chart. It peaked at number 53 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart.\n\nOn October 8, 2010, Ne-Yo performed some of his songs from the new album at P.C. Richard & Son Theater in New York City, an event hosted by iHeartRadio. Ne-Yo made an appearance at New York ComicCon to announce that he was collaborating with Stan Lee for a Libra Scale comic. Ne-Yo also met with fans for pictures and autographs in the Cultyard of the ComicCon. The second and third singles released from the album are \"Champagne Life\" and \"One in a Million\", respectively.\n\n\"Libra Scale\" was released on November 22, 2010. It received critical acclaim from music critics, but was a commercial disappointment, debuting at number nine on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart, selling less than all of his previous three studio albums. Ne-Yo stated: \"The album is based upon this short story which basically follows these three characters who are forced to choose between money-power-and-fame versus love. Which in turn is why I've called it 'Libra Scale'. You know, its whole concept is based on that question of morality – that, if you weighed it all out on a libra scale, which one of those two options would you choose?\". \"Libra Scale\" sold 112,000 copies in its first week. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number 11 on the UK Albums Chart, while debuting at number one on the UK R&B Chart.\n\nOn February 25, 2011, while on his tour in the United Kingdom, he announced his new album would be called \"Love and Passion\" and would be released in September, but this was proven false as the title was tentative. American rapper Fabolous said in an interview that he is planning a collaboration album with Ne-Yo as well. Ne-Yo has also written songs for Mary J. Blige, JB, Beyoncé, Monica, Alexandra Burke, Cheryl Cole and Willow Smith's upcoming albums. Ne-Yo starred in two motion pictures, the long-gestating George Lucas project \"Red Tails\", released in early 2012, and \"\", which was released in the United States on March 11, 2011. Ne-Yo has already finished writing songs for American singer and Roc Nation artist Alexis Jordan and her self-titled debut album as well as Jennifer Hudson for her second studio album, \"I Remember Me\", which had a North American release on March 22, 2011. Ne-Yo appeared in the children's preschool show \"The Fresh Beat Band\" and was one of the few artists not to cancel appearances in the wake of the 2011 Japan earthquake.\n\nIn the spring of 2011, Ne-Yo collaborated with American rapper Pitbull and Nayer on his single \"Give Me Everything\", which peaked at number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, giving Ne-Yo his second US number-one single, his first since 2006's \"So Sick\" and his first as a guest artist. Ne-Yo also revealed in an interview that he would like to collaborate with Chris Brown, Lil Wayne and Drake on his upcoming album.\nIn January 2012, it was reported that Ne-Yo, along with his label imprint Compound Entertainment, had moved from Def Jam Recordings to Motown Records. He was also appointed Senior Vice President of A&R of Motown, where he would serve \"...as a producer and mentor to the label's artists, as well as seeking out and signing new talent to the label.\" Ne-Yo was slated to release his fifth studio album, \"R.E.D.\" (as in \"Realizing Every Dream\"), on September 18, 2012. The album was initially titled \"The Cracks in Mr. Perfect\". The album's first official single, \"Lazy Love\", was released on June 12, 2012 and peaked at number forty-two on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \"Let Me Love You (Until You Learn to Love Yourself)\", co-written by Australian singer-songwriter Sia, was released as the second single on July 31, 2012. Because of Kevin McCall's new album and the song Ne-Yo will be in, \"Love Time\", was not yet released because he and his friend Chris Brown will make an appearance on Ne-Yo's R.E.D. album in the song called \"What I Do\", which they all will be involved in writing the beat says Ne-Yo, who was interviewed by TMZ in New York. \"I expect this to be a banger in clubs for the slow songs and to get Ne-Yo his first top 10 song in years,\" said Chris Brown, after a celebrity basketball game with Ne-Yo, Kevin Hart, and other celebrities in the month of July.\n\nOn August 29, 2012, Ne-Yo was one of the headliners alongside R&B recording artist Melanie Fiona, in the \"Summer Beats Concert Series\", otherwise known as the \"MJ Birthday Concert\", which was on what would have been the 54th birthday of the late American pop icon Michael Jackson which was sponsored by and live-streamed by Pepsi and \"Billboard\". He performed a medley of hits, as well as performing \"The Way You Make Me Feel\", \"Smooth Criminal\" and \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" from Jackson's best-selling 1987 album, \"Bad\", in preparation for the reissue of \"Bad 25\" on September 18, 2012. The concert took place at Gotham Hall in New York City. \"R.E.D.\" was released in the United Kingdom on November 5, and in North America on November 6, 2012.\n\nIn 2012, Ne-Yo was awarded the Hal David Starlight Award of the Songwriter's Hall of Fame which honors gifted songwriters who are at an apex in their careers and are making a significant impact in the music industry via their original songs.\nIn March 2013, Ne-Yo collaborated with Akon on David Guetta's single \"Play Hard\", from his 2012 album \"Nothing but the Beat 2.0\". He also collaborated with Jessica Sanchez on her single \"Tonight\" from her debut album \"Me, You & the Music\". The single, along with the music video was released on March 21, 2013. In April, Ne-Yo and Cher Lloyd collaborated on their single \"It's All Good\", which eventually was featured on Fruttare commercials. Around the same time, he and Celine Dion recorded \"Incredible\" for Dion's 2013 album \"Loved Me Back to Life\". \"Incredible\" was released as a single in February 2014 and the music video premiered in June 2014.\n\nOn May 29, 2014, Ne-Yo announced his upcoming sixth studio album would be called \"Non-Fiction\". That same day, he announced a new single, \"Money Can't Buy\". On September 16, 2014, the lead single from \"Non Fiction\" was sent to mainstream radio titled \"She Knows\" featuring Juicy J. A few months later, Ne-Yo announced that the new release date for \"Non-Fiction\" was January 27, 2015. The album included collaborations with Pitbull and Charisse Mills. The album peaked at number five on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart.\n\nIn July 2015, Ne-Yo collaborated with Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike on a new song for the Tomorrowland anthem titled \"Higher Place\". In 2016, Ne-Yo collaborated with Yunel and J Alvarez for their single entitled \"Sin Miedo\", released on November 12, 2016 and with Diamond Platnumz for their single entitled \"Marry You\", released on February 2, 2017.\n\nOn May 8, 2017, Ne-Yo released a single \"Earn Your Love\" from his forthcoming seventh album, whilst announcing that the album is slated for a release in 2017. A new single, \"Another Love Song\" was released on May 30, 2017. In July 2017, he made a cameo in the comedy film \"Girls Trip\", starring Queen Latifah, Jada Pinkett Smith and Regina Hall.\n\nOn March 27, 2020, Ne-Yo collaborated with Jamaican dancehall singer Charly Black for a new single, \"Over Again\". \n\nNe-Yo's music is generally R&B, while he also incorporates pop and hip hop occasionally. His musical influences include Michael Jackson, Luther Vandross, R. Kelly, Babyface, Blackstreet and Usher. Ne-Yo is noted for his tenor voice, including his application of falsetto in his works.\n\nNe-Yo frequently co-writes with Tor Erik Hermansen and Mikkel S. Eriksen of the Norwegian production team Stargate. Ne-Yo met them in a hallway at Sony Music Studios in New York, and knowing the team produced R&B records, decided to collaborate with them. The collective's early works were tracks from \"In My Own Words\", including \"So Sick\".\n\nAside from working on his own album, Ne-Yo also collaborates with several other artists. His works include: Rihanna's top-ten singles \"Unfaithful\", \"Russian Roulette\", and her number-one hit \"Take a Bow\", Mario Vazquez's \"Gallery\", Paula DeAnda's \"Walk Away (Remember Me)\", and Beyoncé Knowles' \"Billboard\" Hot 100 number-one single \"Irreplaceable\", which stayed at the top of the chart for ten consecutive weeks. He wrote the song \"I'm You\" for Leona Lewis's debut album \"Spirit\", and is currently writing songs for her next album and for the debut album of fellow X Factor winner Alexandra Burke. He has also been working with Sugababes for their seventh album, with member Keisha Buchanan confirming that Ne-Yo had written a song called \"No More You\" for their album.\nIn 2010, he dueted with Mariah Carey on \"Angel's Cry\", a song for her cancelled album, \"Angels Advocate\".\nNe-Yo has also written songs for Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Carrie Underwood, Anastacia, Ciara, Corbin Bleu, Enrique Iglesias, and Dima Bilan. He collaborated with Lindsay Lohan on her new material, having already finished \"Bossy\", a pre-single for her new album \"Spirit in the Dark\". In 2007, Ne-Yo confirmed that he had been contacted by producer will.i.am to work on what would have been Michael Jackson's new album. However, at the time of Jackson's death, Ne-Yo's collaborations with him had yet to move past the writing stage. In an interview in 2010, Ne-Yo said that, since Jackson's death, he had been confused as what to do with the songs, as he felt that selling them to another artist or even releasing the songs himself would be disrespectful to Jackson's legacy. In 2009, he wrote \"Truth (Saigo no Shinjitsu)\" for w-inds., the Japanese pop group.\n\nNe-Yo ventured out to open his own recording studio, called Carrington House, in Atlanta, Georgia. He also had started his own production company, Compound Entertainment, in 2007, and has hired several producers and songwriters in hopes of turning it into a full-fledged record label. It successfully became a label, and artists such as RaVaughn, Paula Campbell, Sixx John, Adrienne Bailon and Shanell are now associated with Compound.\n\nIn 2011 Ne-Yo was approached by Cartoon Network to help create an animated series. Ne-Yo announced that the show would be titled \"I Heart Tuesday\" and that he had created it for his sister. He also stated that he wanted to avoid having the show resemble the anime art style of \"The Boondocks\" due to the potential cost of the show's animation style.\n\nNe-Yo appeared in an episode of of \"\" as a hit-man, under his birth name of Shaffer Smith.\n\nIn 2011, Ne-Yo appeared in an episode of \"The Fresh Beat Band\" as himself.\n\nHe starred as the Tin Man in NBC's musical telecast adaptation of \"The Wiz\" alongside David Alan Grier, Elijah Kelley, Queen Latifah, Common, Amber Riley, Uzo Aduba and Mary J. Blige. The musical telecast premiered December 3, 2015 as a three-hour event. For his performance, he received a Critics' Choice Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Movie made for Television or Limited Series.\n\nIn May 2018, he took part in the Celebrity Ninja Warrior special for Red Nose Day. He completed the course, resulting in a $30,000 donation.\n\nIn December 2018, he was the entertainment at 67th Miss Universe pageant where he performed during the final catwalk.\n\nNe-Yo is passionate about the arts and children, and has shown his support for Little Kids Rock by filming a PSA for the organization.\n\nIn 2005, Jesseca White, Ne-Yo's girlfriend at the time, gave birth to a boy, naming him Chimere after Ne-Yo's middle name. Though Ne-Yo believed he was the father, he later discovered the child was not his.\n\nIn June 2010, Ne-Yo told \"Ebony\" that he and his then-girlfriend, Monyetta Shaw, were expecting their first child together – a girl due early in 2011. Shaw gave birth early to daughter Madilyn Grace Smith on November 12, 2010, in Atlanta, Georgia. Announcing the birth, Ne-Yo said of his first child, \"I've been in love before but this feels like nothing I've ever felt... like I'm in love for the first time.\"\n\nIn September 2011, Ne-Yo revealed that he was expecting his second child with Monyetta Shaw. Shaw gave birth to a boy, Mason Evan Smith, on October 9, 2011.\n\nIn September 2015, the singer announced that he and Crystal Renay Williams were engaged and expecting a child. They were married on February 20, 2016. Their son, Shaffer Chimere Smith, Jr., was born on March 15, 2016. Their second son, Roman Alexander-Raj Smith was born on June 14, 2018. However, in February 2020, Ne-Yo has announced that he and Crystal Smith will be ending their marriage.\n\nIn 2019, in wake of the television documentary, Surviving R. Kelly, Ne-Yo confirmed his support for the Mute R.

{"id": "2172712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172712", "title": "Workington A.F.C.", "text": "Workington A.F.C.\n\nWorkington Association Football Club is an English football club based in Workington, Cumbria. The club competes in the Northern Premier League Division One North West, the eighth tier of English football.\n\nThe club plays its home matches at Borough Park, which has a capacity of 3,101. The club is often referred to as Workington Reds (red being its home colour) to distinguish it from Rugby League club Workington Town. Its traditional rivals are Carlisle United and Barrow.\n\nTheir current manager is Danny Grainger\n\nFootball in Workington has a very long history. Close by and adjacent to the home of Workington A.F.C the folk game of \"Uppies and Downies\" is still an annual event. There are records about the game from 20 April 1775 in the \"Cumbrian Pacquet\" which is one of the earliest reports of a football match ever. This report says the match on which it is reporting is \"long contended\" thereby noting an even longer unwritten history of the game in this Cumbrian town.\n\nAssociation football was introduced to Workington in the 1860s and further popularised when a group of steel workers migrated to the town from Dronfield, Derbyshire. They were workers of the Charles Cammel and Co steel works that arrived in the town in 1884. It is estimated that 1,500 townspeople moved to Workington. 'Dronnies', as the people of Workington called the newcomers, formed Workington AFC in 1888. This is also confirmed in a short history of the club which was produced as part of 16 page brochure in the club's application to the Football League in 1951.\n\nThe original Workington A.F.C. were one of the founder members of the Cumberland Association League in 1888 and played at Lonsdale Park. In 1894 they moved to the Cumberland Senior League, and in 1901 joined the Lancashire League. However, the league closed two seasons later, and they returned to the Cumberland Senior League. In 1904 the club were admitted to the Lancashire Combination, but in 1910 seasons they decided to economise and join the North Eastern League. However, after only one season, the club folded.\n\nThe new Workington A.F.C. was born in 1921 and immediately joined the North Eastern League. During the 1933–34 season, the club managed its best-ever FA Cup performance, reaching the 4th round, before losing to Preston North End. Later in the decade, the club moved to its present home, Borough Park. In 1951 the club was voted into the Third Division North of the Football League, replacing New Brighton.\n\nThe early Football League years of Workington Reds are chronicled in a series of books entitled \"So Sad So Very Sad – The League History of Workington AFC\": part 1 (1951–58), part 2 (1958–64) and part 3 (1964–65).\n\nTheir first season in the League was a sign of things to come: the club finished rock bottom, and only improved by one place the following year.\n\nFrom 6 January 1954 to 15 November 1955 the club was managed by Bill Shankly, who would achieve fame between 1959 and 1974 with his success at home and abroad as manager of Liverpool.\n\nDuring the 1957–58 season they played the great Manchester United team known as the Busby Babes at home in the 3rd round of the FA Cup, attracting a record crowd of 21,000. This was just a month before eight of the United players lost their lives in the Munich air disaster. However, at the end of that season, the club dropped into the newly formed Fourth Division after a reorganisation of the Football League which saw the abolition of the regionalised Third Divisions.\n\nIn 1964, player-manager Ken Furphy led them to 3rd position, earning promotion to the Third Division. During both the 1963–64 and 1964–65 season, they made it to the quarter-finals of the League Cup, where they lost to West Ham United and Chelsea (in a replay) respectively. During the latter cup run, the club beat Lancashire neighbours Barrow 9–1, a record which remained until the mid-1980s. The club's proudest night was at Blackburn Rovers on 22 October 1964 in a Football League Cup 3rd round replay. A Workington team of seasoned professionals such as Keith Burkinshaw, Dave Carr, Ken Furphy and Kit Napier and a few young upstarts, like John Ogilvie who went on to have a long career at the club that reached 430 appearances, beat the Blackburn team 5–1 at Ewood Park. The Blackburn team that night were full of internationals, such as Ronnie Clayton, Mike England, Newton, Byrom etc. This was reported in one newspaper as \"Incredible Fantastic Workington rubbed Rovers elegant noses in the mud of Ewood park to produce the finest result in their 80 year history\"\n\nOn 3 April 1965, Workington gave a debut to one of the youngest players ever to play in the Football League, Tony Geidmintis, who was ony 15 years 247 days old. Geidmintis went on to play 328 games for Workington, scoring 37 goals, and made 452 league appearances in all before retiring at the age of 31. He died prematurely from a heart condition at the age of 43.\n\nThe mid-1960s also saw Workington give a debut to one of the earliest black professional footballers in the Football League. This was Peter Foley, who played over 80 games for Workington as a forward and scored some 16 goals for the club, before moving on to Scunthorpe where he kept a young Kevin Keegan out of the team for a couple of years. Later, Foley became an ambassador for racial equality in football, receiving an Order of the British Empire for his work.\n\nIn 1966, Workington finished 5th, narrowly missing out on promotion to the Second Division, but the next year they finished bottom and were relegated back to the Fourth Division. Manager Ken Furphy had moved on to Watford, taking some of Workington's key players such as Dave Carr and Dixie Hale with him. This marked the start of Workington's downward spiral back to non-league status.\n\nIn the 1968–69 season Workington gave a Football League debut to one of the game's legendary goalkeepers, John Burridge. Burridge, born locally, made his debut against Newport County on the last day of the 1968/69 season; in an inauspicious debut, one of his very first touches saw him punch the ball into his own net from a Newport corner.\n\nIn the late '60s and early '70s, Workington had \"Johnny Martin on the wing\", a statement that became the most popular chant for Workington supporters. A cult hero at the club, Martin was often dubbed the \"poor man's George Best\", but to older supporters with longer memories, his tricks were reminiscent of the Clown Prince of Football Len Shackleton. Martin would, for example, dribble past two or three opponents, then sit on the ball and ask who wanted it next. Martin played 224 league and cup games for Workington, scoring 33 goals. He joined the club in 1969 and was transferred to Southport in 1974.\n\nIn 1974 and 1975 the club finished second from bottom, and in 1976 they finished bottom. In 1977 the club won only four games, and again finished bottom of the league with attendances falling well below the 1,000-mark. This poor run led to the club being voted out of the League in summer 1977, replaced by Wimbledon. Workington were the penultimate team to fail the re-election process before it was scrapped in 1986; Southport, who were voted out the year after Workington, were the last.\n\nDuring the 1985–86 season, one of the world's football greats played for Workington. The club was in poor financial straits with debts of £300,000, but on 9 April 1986 George Best played for the \"Reds\" in a fund-raising friendly match against a Lancashire Football League 11. The Oldham Athletic chairman, Ian Stott, put together a team managed by Joe Royle to play at Borough Park. Hence a few weeks before Best's fortieth birthday he captained the Workington team with Phil Neal leading out the opposition, which included players from Oldham Athletic, Carlisle United and Bolton Wanderers.\n\nThe club's appearance record for the whole period that Workington played in the Football League was achieved by Bobby Brown. Born in Motherwell, Brown played for Polkemmet, Motherwell and Workington. Brown, who was selected for the Third Division North representative team while at Workington, made a total of 469 league and cup appearances for the club between 1956 and 1967.\n\nBobby Brown, Malcolm Newlands, Jimmy Fleming, Dennis Stokoe and Jack Bertolini were all recognised by the Football League and played in the Football League Third Division North vs. South Representative Games during the 1950s.\n\nThe club dropped into the Northern Premier League (NPL), but failed to trouble the top teams, never finishing higher than 7th, before they were relegated to the NPL First Division in 1988. They continued to struggle, eventually being relegated to the North West Counties League in 1998. However, the club managed to win the League at their first attempt (This was also their first ever championship). After a 2–0 defeat at Kidsgrove Athletic on 27 February 1999, manager Peter Hampton set the squad a challenge, win their last 14 games and they would win the league. Sure enough after winning the next 13 games Workington squared up to league leaders Mossley at Borough Park in front of a 2,281 spectators, a league record only beaten by the formation of F.C. United of Manchester. Workington ran out 2–1 winners with goals from Stuart Williamson and substitute Grant Holt. Workington became the first club to return to the NPL First Division at the first attempt.\n\nAs a result of a 7th-place finish in 2004, the club moved up to the NPL's Premier Division during the non-league restructuring. They then continued their upward movement by winning the first-ever NPL promotion play-offs (after finishing in 2nd place) to win promotion to the Conference North.\n\nFollowing a mid-table finish in their first season in Conference North, the 2006–07 season saw Workington finish in third place and qualify for the promotion play-offs where they lost 2–1 against Hinckley United.\nAfter two mid table finishes the following seasons, Workington made the play offs again in 2009–10 this time going down 4–1 on aggregate to Alfreton Town in the semi final.\n\nThe Club's longest serving manager Darren Edmondson left the club in December to take over at Barrow. Former player Ian McDonald took over as manager prior to Christmas. He was unable to save the club from relegation as Workington finished 22nd in Conference North.\n\nIan McDonald resigned as manager at the end of the 2013/14 season. Gavin Skelton was appointed as his replacement in May 2014. Derek Townsley joined the club as Skelton's assistant.\n\n2014/15\n\nSkelton led the Borough Park side to the Northern Premier League Play-offs in his first full season in charge, finally falling to Ilkeston Town in front of 1,391 supporters at Borough Park. Skelton left Workington in June 2015 to take a coaching role with the Dumfries club Queen of the South. Derek Townsley was appointed as his replacement a couple of weeks later.\nAverage attendance for home games rose to 605 with the game against league champions F.C. United of Manchester attracting 2,603.\n\n2015/16\n\nWorkington qualified for their second successive Northern Premier League Play-off beating Blyth Spartans 4-3 in the semi final before going down 2-3 in the final against Salford City\n\n2016/17\n\nOn 19 April 2017, having beaten Ilkeston 2-0, Workington qualified for their third successive Northern Premier League playoff losing 2-3 in the semi final against Stourbridge after extra time.\n\n2017/18\n\nAfter a slow start to the season the side went on a 17 match unbeaten run to sit 2nd in the Northern Premier League table at the turn of the year. Unfortunately with a long injury list to the small squad the team slipped down the table in the new year to eventually finish 12th. \nThe team also had an excellent run in the FA Trophy reaching the last 16 after knocking out higher league opposition in the form of Hartlepool United of the Vanarama Conference and Weston-super-Mare A.F.C of the National League South before being beaten by eventual finalists Bromley FC in a replay.\n\nDefender Bobby Brown is the current (2014) record holder for Workington, all of Brown's 469 appearances were during the period Workington were during the football league. Brown was also honoured to represent the club in Football League Third Division North vs. South Representative Games. Only 2 others have passed the 400 appearance mark; defender John Ogilvie with 431 again in the football league years and more recently defender Kyle May reached the 400 milestone in the club's non-league days and has already reached 430. Long serving goalkeeper Mike Rogan fell just short with 390 appearances.\n\nThe following players won full senior international caps:\n\nGlenn Murray\n\nThe details of Workington A.F.C.'s performance year by year between 1921 and 2005 is detailed in Tom Allen's book Reds Remembered – The Definitive Workington A.F.C.\n\n"}

The two municipalities Emmaboda and Nybro belong to Kalmar County and Lessebo and Uppvidinge belong to Kronoberg County. The area is part of the province Småland, and Nybro is considered the capital of the Kingdom of Crystal area. The Kingdom of Crystal is known for its handblown glass with a continuous story since 1742.The glassworks have become part of the culture of Sweden; examples can be found in many Swedish homes, recognisable by a small sticker at the bottom with the name Orrefors, Kosta, etc. The height of glass production was the end of the 19th century during which 77 glass factories were established with more than half of them situated in Småland. \n\nWhen touring the forested province of Småland in Sweden, it is normal to visit at least one of the glassworks. The larger ones have adjacent museums and are open for visitors to see the glass blowing hall, normally looking down from a platform. Food is available as well as shopping for all kinds of glass products such as glasses, bowls, vases and unique glass ornaments. The Kingdom of Crystal is a popular and a well known tourist destination. The Regional Council of Kalmar County conducts a study every four years to survey the Swedish public regarding their knowledge and awareness about Kalmar County, its places to visit and tourist attractions. The survey was conducted by Kantar Sifo and included 1500 respondents aged 20-79 years old. The survey results found that the Kingdom of Crystal area was the most visited tourist attraction in the Kalmar County attracting a wide group of people. One in five aged 40-79 years old had visited the area in the last five years. The visitors had no significant difference in terms of geographical belonging, income or gender. The only difference that could be noted was that the group visiting the area tended to be of older age rather than young. Among the respondents aged 40-65+ years old only 3% claimed they never heard of the Kingdom of Crystal.\n\nThe more notable are Orrefors Glasbruk, with the adjacent National School of Glass and Kosta Glasbruk, which is the basis for the Kosta Boda company. Each one of the glassworks have distinctive design traditions, character and atmosphere.\n\n\nIn the Kingdom of Crystal, there are a large number of small businesses in the glass industry, which are often spin-offs from some of the larger companies.

At the accession of King John III, he was appointed the Lord High Justiciar of Sweden (\"riksdrots\") and Governor of Norrland as well as Governor of Stockholm Castle again. \n\nHe married Beata Stenbock (1533–1583), daughter of Gustaf Olofsson Stenbock and Brita Eriksdotter Leijonhufvud, and elder sister of Gustav Vasa's third wife, Katarina Stenbock. Brahe's mother-in-law was the daughter of Erik Abrahamsson Leijonhufvud and Ebba Eriksdotter Vasa, the mother of Gustav Vasa's second wife, Margaret Eriksdotter Leijonhufvud. (Ebba Eriksdotter Vasa was herself a second cousin of Gustav Vasa.)\n\nBrahe was the father of Erik Brahe (1552–1614), Gustaf Brahe (1558–1615), Margareta Brahe (1559–1638), Magnus Brahe (1564–1633), Sigrid Brahe and Abraham Brahe (1569–1630), and the grandfather of Per Brahe the Younger (1602–1680), Ebba Brahe and Margareta Brahe.\n"}

He managed to walk away from the hoax with more than half a million dollars.\n\nArnold was a poorly educated hatter's apprentice when he enlisted to serve in the Mexican–American War. He then went to California as part of the Gold Rush of 1849. He apparently met with some success there, as he was able to return to his native Kentucky, buy a farm, marry, and start a family.\n\nBy 1870, he had returned to the West to take a job as a miner and prospector. He and his cousin John Slack obtained some industrial-grade diamonds from their friend James B. Cooper, then an assistant bookkeeper for the Diamond Drill Company of San Francisco. They mixed the diamonds in with garnets, rubies, and sapphires he bought from Indians in Arizona.\n\nArnold and Slack took their bag of jewels to the office of local businessman George D. Roberts, whom they convinced that they had found them in a previously-undiscovered deposit. They swore Roberts to secrecy and asked him to store the gems in his office. But, Roberts could not keep a secret and eventually drew several other men into Arnold's trap, including: William C. Ralston, founder of the Bank of California; Asbury Harpending; William Lent; and General George S. Dodge. Together, they put together an offer to buy out Arnold and Slack, and gave them a $50,000 down payment.\n\nArnold and Slack used the money to go to England and acquire additional uncut gems, valued at about $20,000. Some would go back to San Francisco to further convince Roberts and his investment group. Others would be planted for later discovery.\n\nIn the mean time, Ralston and the others sent a sample of Arnold's gems to New York City for inspection by Charles Lewis Tiffany. Tiffany set up a meeting at the Madison Avenue home of attorney Samuel Barlow, to solicit additional investors. They included such notable figures as George B. McClellan, U.S. Congressman Benjamin Franklin Butler, and Horace Greeley.\n\nTiffany grossly overestimated the value of the stones at $150,000—far more than the $20,000 Arnold had actually spent to acquire them in England. This quickly netted the conman an additional $100,000 from the new investors, which he took back to London. There he acquired $8,000 in more uncut gems to keep their attention.\n\nEventually, the investors demanded to visit the source of these gems and Arnold and Slack planted their diamonds on a remote location in northwest Colorado Territory. They led the investors west from St. Louis in June 1872. Arriving at the town of Rawlins, in the Wyoming Territory, they continued on horseback. But Arnold and Slack wanted to keep the exact location a secret, so they led the group on a confusing four-day journey through the countryside.\n\nOn June 4, 1872, Arnold, Slack and company finally reached the spot where they had previously planted some gems and encouraged the investors to begin digging. For more than an hour, precious stones were found in abundance. And, before all was said and done, they had given Arnold $450,000 for the remainder of his rights to any future claim on the property.\n\nThe hoax was not discovered until October 1872, when the United States Department of the Interior sent a survey team, led by geologist Clarence King of Yale University, to inspect the site. King soon deduced that the various stones were formed under different conditions and would never be found together in a single deposit. Concluding that it was a fraud, he quickly traveled to San Francisco to inform Ralston and the other investors, unveiling the Diamond hoax of 1872.\n\nIn the meantime, Arnold took his proceeds from the scheme and bought a two-story brick house in his native Elizabethtown, as well as some five hundred acres of nearby farmland—all of which he had deeded in the name of his wife Mary.\n\nIn 1873, Arnold decided to go into the banking business himself, buying a defunct Elizabethtown financial institution. But, in 1878, he became embroiled in a feud with another banker in town that resulted in a serious shotgun wound to his shoulder. He died six months later of pneumonia, at age 49.\n\nJohn Slack died 1896 in New Mexico\n\nIn the 1963 television series \"The Great Adventure\" there was an episode based on this fraud called \"The Great Diamond Mountain\". Arnold was played by actor John Fiedler.\n\nThe Philip Arnold House in Elizabethtown, where he lived from 1872 to his death in 1879, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n"}

Clinton Dillard Castleberry, Jr. (October 10, 1923 – November 7, 1944) was a football player in the 1940s. Georgia Tech coach Bobby Dodd said that if Castleberry had lived to finish his playing career “he’d have probably been an All-American for three years and been the greatest back in Georgia Tech history.”\n\nCastleberry showed extraordinary ability as a Georgia Tech \"pony\" back, standing at only 5'9\" and weighing only 155 lbs. In high school, he played for Boys High in Atlanta, where he averaged 171 rushing yards per game and scored 102 points. In 1942, freshmen were ruled eligible to play varsity ball as rosters were drained by World War II. This allowed Castleberry to display his spectacular prowess on the football field. On October 3, 1942, Georgia Tech beat Notre Dame for the first time since 1928, especially impressive as the game was played in South Bend and Notre Dame had not lost a game in two years. Castleberry led Georgia Tech in both passing and rushing yards, even after Notre Dame Head Coach Frank Leahy had been warned by a scout that Castleberry was \"the most dangerous runner in America.\"\n\nAgainst national power Navy, Castleberry led Tech to an impressive win on October 24, 1942 in Annapolis that was broadcast worldwide via the Armed Forces Radio Network. The momentum changer of the game occurred when Navy was driving for a score near the Tech goal line. Castleberry was put in to play defense on a passing situation on fourth down. He anticipated the Navy pass and stepped in front of the intended receiver for an interception. He scampered away with a dazzling run of 95 yards for a touchdown. Tech coach Bobby Dodd described it as “a magnificent run that I can still follow step by step in my mind. It shook Navy to its keel, and Tech won 21-0.” Dodd called it Castleberry’s greatest play. The national press began to take notice of Castleberry.\n\nGeorgia Tech started the season 9-0 and climbed to a top five national ranking. During that ninth win, Castleberry injured his knee in a hard-fought 20-7 win over Florida in Atlanta. Despite the injury, Castleberry played in the final two games of the season, but not quite at full speed. On New Year's Day, Tech traveled to the Cotton Bowl Classic, losing a tight game with Texas, 14-7. Castleberry's injury improved for the bowl game, yet he was still not quite a hundred percent.\n\nCastleberry finished third in the Heisman trophy voting for the season, behind winner Frank Sinkwich and Paul Governali, both seniors. This was the highest a freshman had ever placed in the Heisman voting. Castleberry's number 19 is the only football jersey Georgia Tech has ever retired.\n\nAfter the 1942 season was over, Castleberry enlisted in Army Air Forces and planned to return to play football at Georgia Tech after the War. Castleberry underwent surgery on February 2, 1943 at the Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta to repair his damaged knee. He withdrew from Georgia Tech on February 18 and reported for military duty in Miami. After a physical evaluation by Army doctors, it was determined that Castleberry was fit for service.\n\nCastleberry completed Army flight school training and earned his wings in the summer of 1944. He was sent to the Mediterranean Theatre in the fall. He co-piloted a B-26 Marauder bomber known as \"Dream Girl\" and was stationed in Africa. In the early morning hours of November 7, 1944, Lt. Castleberry took off from Roberts Field in Liberia with another B-26 to continue a ferrying run up the coast toward Dakar, Senegal. Neither of the two planes made it to their destination. An extensive six-day search involving American and British search crews was conducted. On November 23, 1944, all crew members were officially re-classified from MIA to KNB (killed, no body) after a British RAF plane observed unidentified wreckage believed to have been from the missing planes.\n\n"}

{"id": "2172780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172780", "title": "Max Adler (Marxist)", "text": "Max Adler (Marxist)\n\nMax Adler (; ; 15 January 1873 – 28 June 1937) was an Austrian jurist, politician and social philosopher; his theories were of central importance to Austromarxism. He was a brother of Oskar Adler.\n\nMax Adler obtained his doctorate in law in 1896, and became a professional lawyer. He began to teach in the “Schönbrunn Circle” in the early summer of 1919. Max Winter, the deputy mayor of Vienna, was able to make rooms available in the main building of Schönbrunn Castle for the \"Kinderfreunde Österreich\" (an Austrian association for children and families). In the \"Schönbrunner Erzieherschule\", where young people were trained to be teachers, Max Adler and his colleagues Wilhelm Jerusalem, Alfred Adler, Marianne Pollak, Josef Luitpold Stern and Otto Felix Kanitz were able to realize practical educational reforms. In 1920 he qualified at Vienna University, where he became Extraordinary Professor of Sociology and Social philosophy. From 1919 to 1921 he was a Social-Democratic member of the regional parliament of Niederösterreich. Adler was active in Adult Education, and from 1904 to 1925, with Rudolf Hilferding, editor of \"\"Marx-Studien\"\".\n\nMax Adler's first theoretical work of note was a study \"\"Max Stirner. Ein Beitrag zur Feststellung des Verhältnisses von Socialismus und Individualismus\"\" (1894). The title sets the agenda for Adler's later theoretical activities. Although this study of Marx's scorned opponent seriously antagonized Marxist Party theorists, and so remained unpublished, Stirner remained an influence on Adler's thinking throughout his life. Adler's biographer Alfred Pfabigan, upon sight of his unpublished papers, was surprised by his “intellectual relationship with Stirner owing to its high degree of continuity”.\n\nBecause Adler wanted to operate within the framework of the rising Social Democratic movement, he was highly circumspect in his subsequent references to Stirner, and, while continuing to accord him great significance as Marx's “psychological counterpart”, initially adopted most aspects of the doctrine of Historical Materialism: the essence of history is class struggle, and its realization entails a union of theory with revolutionary practice. He envisaged “ever greater harmony and perfection” arising from the contradictions inherent in the then state of society, until the proletariat, in the course of its revolution, would finally see “the pursuit of its own class interests” coincide with “the solidarity of society”. In a departure from orthodox Marxism, Adler's conception reduces the dialectic to a mere sociological methodology, not expressive of any specific dialectic intrinsic to the historical process. In common with other theorists of the Second International, such as Karl Kautsky and Karl Liebknecht, Adler also rejects the association between Scientific Socialism and Materialism: true Marxism was “in reality social idealism“. For Adler, Historical Materialism essentially becomes subjective idealism. In all consistency, his particular interest then turned to producing an epistemological critique of Sociology, combining Marxist themes with Kantian transcendentalism. According to Adler, “the individual consciousness is a priori socialized”, insofar as every logical judgement already and necessarily includes reference to a multitude of assenting subjects; Adler's ‘social a priori’ transcendentally implies the possibility of social reality.\n\nAdler's contributions to a Marxist general theory of the state emerged in the course of disputes with Hans Kelsen and Hermann Heller. Criticizing the formal concept of democracy, Adler distinguished between political democracy, as a manifestation of the hegemony of the bourgeoisie, and a social democracy, in which oppression was to be removed along with social differences, the whole to be replaced by “solidarity-based administrative reform” of society. For Adler, the establishment of a socialist society remained linked to the ‘dismantling of the machinery of the state’ along Marxist lines. Adler the politician permitted no compromises with the so-called \"social chauvinism\", or majority-Socialist “reformism”. Not the least important aspect of the Austromarxism espoused by Adler, Otto Bauer and Rudolf Hilferding was its relevance to the discussions on the left wing of German Social Democracy before 1933.\n\n\n\n"}

It was published by American company DC Comics under the Wildstorm imprint.\n\nThe series was originally intended to be a film script and then as a single graphic novel, leading to an absence of the traditional cliffhangers associated with monthly comics.\n\nSet in an era \"one hundred years from now\", \"Ocean\" is a science fiction story that tells the tale of Nathan Kane, a United Nations special weapons inspector, and his mission to Cold Harbor, a UN research station in orbit around Europa.\n\nThe Harbor's scientists have discovered a set of nonhuman artifacts in the ocean deep below the ice that covers the moon, and further research reveals that the artifacts are the powerful weapons, wormhole-based transport system, and cryogenic resting place of a conquering warlike race of prehuman beings.\n\nThis culture's home world was located between Mars and Jupiter, and in their ongoing civil war against each other, they wrought great damage on Mars, which used to be a far more temperate, colonized Earthlike planet before its atmosphere was destroyed in the same conflict that also utterly destroyed their home planet, its remains eventually becoming the asteroid belt. This last act was apparently a threshold event of some kind that caused the culture to lay down their arms, possibly out of shame or out of fear of some kind of reprisal. As a result, they put themselves and their technology in suspended animation deep within Europa's ocean. One of the Cold Harbor scientists suggests that this was motivated chiefly by their inability to live with themselves. However, before doing so, the culture seeded Earth with the genetic material that allowed human life to grow.\n\nHowever, thanks to the unscrupulous acts of the insane manager of a weapons testing facility also in orbit around Europa, owned by an interplanetary corporation named Doors, the race starts to wake up, putting the Earth itself at risk from the resurgence of the extremely powerful and violent precursor race, and Nathan and the Harbor scientists are practically the only ones that can stop them.\n\nA trade paperback collection of the series was published by Wildstorm in 2005 ().\n\nDC imprint Vertigo released a Deluxe Edition in 2015 that \"Ocean\" combined into one hardcover volume with Ellis' \"Orbiter\", that was originally published by Vertigo ().\n\nThe comic has been optioned by Gianni Nunnari and Nick Wechsler who have history with films based on comics, the former produced \"300\" and the duo are slated to produce the film based on \"Ronin\".\n\nRyan Condal, writer of the spec script \"Galahad\", has been approached by Warner Brothers to produce a screenplay for them.\n\n\n"}

Huxley’s editorial policy was centred on presenting “an understanding of the world that no other periodicals can give”. The original print release of the magazine in 1935 sold out, and a total of 50,000 copies of the first issue were printed. During the first few months of publication the magazine brought its readers stories from Mexico, Tahiti and Ankara, examining different regions in a way that offered both analysis and the traveller’s impression. “There is nothing about this magazine that is not first-rate,” read the issue's review in The Spectator, “and if the standard of the first number can be maintained, it should establish itself both as the most interesting English monthly magazine being published and as an educational factor of considerable importance”. It also noted that \"The Geographical Magazine\" contained “illustrations of the kind that can provoke only an astonished rhapsody”.\n\n\"The Geographical Magazine\" continued to publish throughout the Second World War despite facing shortages of paper and government censorship, and the post-war period saw it expand to accommodate the interpretation of geography as done by geographers into the original founder’s editorial policy.

The southern section is used for civilian purposes. The prospect of relocating the airport elsewhere is often raised as a result of the flight path to the runway being located directly over the city.\n\nThe airport caters for international, domestic and cargo flights and general aviation. A new terminal was opened in 2012 and can handle up to 3.5 million passengers per year.\n\nPoznań–Ławica airport has been confused by pilots with a nearby airbase, Poznań–Krzesiny Airbase (ICAO code: EPKS), which also has a runway.

It is an arcade-style flight combat game, with simpler game controls and physics than flight simulators. It is known for its fast, high-energy action sequences, compared to flight simulators of the time.\n\nTerminal Reality also developed a similar game, \"Fury3\", published that same year by Microsoft. It used the same game engine and basic game mechanics, but was designed to run natively on the new Windows 95 operating system. Though considered to add little to the gameplay of \"Terminal Velocity\", \"Fury3\" spawned an add-on pack, \"F!Zone\", as well as a sequel, \"Hellbender\".\n\nIn 2015, co-founder of Terminal Reality, the game's original developer Mark Randel, released a version for Android and iOS, published by Trebuchet Entertainment.\n\n\"Terminal Velocity\" is a combat flight simulator. The player's craft has no inertia, meaning its course can be changed instantly and can fly at low speeds without falling. There are seven different weapons, ranging from guns, blasters and rockets to homing missiles and a rare secret weapon. Additionally, it possesses powerful afterburners that allow it to move at very high speed, which is useful in order to evade attacks, but sacrifices the ability to return fire temporarily (they can be selected like weapons, and if they are, the fire button will ignite the afterburners). The craft is able to survive some hits, and even some collisions with the terrain, including tunnels.\n\nEach of the 27 missions consists of several objectives, e.g. enemies which must be destroyed, tunnel entrances and exits, mere checkpoints, and an extraction point. At the end of each planet is a powerful boss enemy (or more rarely, a weak boss enemy) that must be destroyed before either proceeding to the next planet or completing the episode.\n\nThe story is set in the year 2704, when the Alliance of Space-Faring Alien Races (ASFAR), of which Earth is a member, suddenly turns against Earth and their fleet ravages the planet, starting a war. The player flies a powerful starfighter, the TV-202, in a series of missions to defeat the enemy. In Episode 3, the player learns that a huge supercomputer known as Xenocidic Initiative (X.I.), located on Proxima Seven, is responsible for the war. Their final mission is to eliminate it. A hidden mission can take place after the main plot only in the CD ROM version where the player must investigate a sudden metamorphosis of an unknown nearby planet and destroy the force that changed the face of the planet. It is revealed here that this force drove a man named Sy Wickens into insanity, and how the X.I. Supercomputer had \"accidentally\" digitized Sy Wickens' persona.\n\n\"Terminal Velocity\" (called \"Velocity Brawl\" during development) was co-produced by Tom Hall. The main programmer of the game was Mark Randel, the former lead programmer of \"Microsoft Flight Simulator\".\n\nThe game has three episodes, the first of which was distributed as shareware. Each episode features three different worlds, making a total of nine levels; the only exception is the final planet of Episode 3, Proxima Seven, which has only two stages. At the end of each world is a boss enemy that must be destroyed before proceeding to the next world. Following the release of the shareware version, publisher 3D Realms was inundated with requests that the game be playable with a mouse, leading the company to include a mouse option in the commercial version of the game.\n\nThe original floppy disk release was followed by a CD-ROM version. The CD-ROM version added 70 MB of extended pre-rendered 3D cut scenes, a bonus hidden planet, higher image resolution (including more detailed textures) and support for 8-player network multiplay. The Macintosh port was published separately by MacSoft.\n\nA reviewer for \"Next Generation\", while acknowledging that the game is \"fun to play\" and has a uniquely wide variety of open locales, gave it an overall negative review. Arguing that the game is a first-person shooter and that \"the genre, as currently exploited, is beginning to wear thin\", he gave it two out of five stars.\n\n"}

Clients can then install the MediaPortal Client software and use the TV-Server to watch live or recorded TV, schedule recordings, view and search EPG data over the network. Since version 1.0.1, the client plugin of the TV-Server has replaced the default built-in TV Engine.\n\nEven without a network (i.e. a singleseat installation), the TV-Server treats the PC as both the server and the client.\n\nThe TV-Server supports watching and recording TV at the same time with only one DVB/ATSC TV Card, on the same transponder (multiplex).\nBroadcast Driver Architecture is used to support as many TV cards as possible.\nThe major brands of cards, like digital-everywhere, Hauppauge, Pinnacle, TechnoTrend and TechniSat, including analog cards, provide BDA drivers for their cards.\n\nThe video player of MediaPortal is a DirectShow Player, so any codec/filter can be used. MediaPortal uses the codec from LAV Filters by default, but the codec can be changed to all installed ones, such like Ffdshow, PowerDVD, CoreAVC, Nvidia PureVideo etc.\nMediaPortal also support video post-processing, with any installed codec.\nDue to the DirectShow player implementation, MediaPortal can play all media files that can be played on Windows.\n\nThe default internal music player uses the BASS Engine with the BASS audio library. The alternative player is the internal DirectShow player.\nWith the BASS Engine MediaPortal supports visualizations from Windows Media Visualizations, Winamp Visualizations including MilkDrop, Sonic and Soundspectrum G-Force.\n\nDigital pictures/photos can be browsed, managed and played as slide shows with background music or radio. The picture player uses different transitions or the Ken Burns effect between each picture.\nExif data are used to rotate the pictures automatically, but the rotation can be done manually too. Zooming of pictures is also possible.\n\nOnlineVideos is a plugin for MediaPortal to integrate seamless online video support into MediaPortal.\nOnlineVideos supports almost 200 sites/channels in a variety of languages and genres such like YouTube, iTunes Movie Trailers, Discovery Channel etc.\n\nMP-TVSeries is a popular TV Series plug-in for MediaPortal. It focuses on managing the user's TV Series library.\nThe MP-TVSeries plugin will scan the hard drive (including network and removable drives) for video files, it then analyzes them by their path structures to determine if they are TV Shows. If the file(s) are recognized then the plugin will go online and retrieve information about them. You can then browse, manage and play your episodes from inside MediaPortal in a nice graphical layout.\n\nThe information and fan art it retrieves is coming from TheTVDB.com which allows any user to add and update information. The extension will automatically update any information when new episodes/files are added.\n\nMoving Pictures is a plug-in that focuses on ease of use and flexibility. Point it to your movies collection and Moving Pictures will automatically load media rich details about your movies as quickly as possible with as little user interaction as possible.

Known mostly for his early reggae works, he brought a political dimension to this music. His house band was known as The Dynamites.\n\nSon of a tailor and builder, Eccles spent his childhood in the countryside of the parish of Saint Mary. Eccles had an itinerant childhood due to his father's need to travel Jamaica seeking work. He used to regularly attend church, and he became influenced by spiritual singing; In his words: \"One of my uncles was a spiritual revivalist, who always did this heavy type of spiritual singing, and I got to love that\". Eccles's professional singing career began as a teenager, working the north-coast hotel circuit in the mid-1950s. In his late teens, he moved to Ocho Rios, where he performed at night in various shows, with artists such as The Blues Busters, Higgs & Wilson and Buster Brown. He moved to Kingston in 1959, where he started his recording career. He first recorded for Coxsone Dodd, who had organised a talent show in which Eccles took part.\n\nEccles had a Jamaican hit in 1961 with the early ska song \"Freedom\", which was recorded in 1959, and was featured on Dodd's sound system for two years before it was released. It was one of the first Jamaican songs with socially oriented lyrics. The song discussed the concept of repatriation to Africa, an idea developed by the growing Rastafari movement. The song became the first Jamaican hit to be used for political purposes; Alexander Bustamante, founder of the Jamaican Labour Party and at that time Chief Minister of Jamaica adopted it for his fight against the Federation of the West Indies in 1960. In the following years, Eccles had other successful songs, mixing boogie/rhythm and blues influences with ska rhythms, such as \"River Jordan\" and \"Glory Hallelujah\".\n\nIn 1962, he started promoting concerts and set up his \"Christmas Morning\" talent show; first with Dodd, then on his own. He organised concerts for The Clarendonians in 1963, and for The Wailers in 1964 and 1965. He launched other talent search contests, with \"Battle of the Stars\", \"Clancy Eccles Revue\", \"Independent Revue\" and \"Reggae Soul Revue\", from which emerged stars such as Barrington Levy and Culture.\n\nStarting in 1963, he recorded with producers such as Charlie Moo (Leslie Kong's business partner) and the husband of Sonia Pottinger, Lyndon. He couldn't make a living from his music, so he quit in 1965 to work as a tailor in Annotto Bay. During this period, he made stage outfits for musicians such as Kes Chin, The Mighty Vikings, Byron Lee and the Dragonaires, Carlos Malcolm and The Blues Busters.\n\nHe went back to music in 1967, producing his own recordings as well as those of other artists. He scored a hit with Eric 'Monty' Morris' reggae song \"Say What You're Saying\", and with his own song \"Feel The Rhythm\", one of several records that were instrumental in the shift from rocksteady to reggae. Eccles has also been credited with deriving the name 'reggae' from 'streggae', Kingston slang for a good-time girl. Eccles' first hit, \"What Will Your Mama Say\" which was released by the recently created United Kingdom label, Pama Records. In 1968, his song \"Fattie Fattie\" became a skinhead reggae classic, along with his productions of recordings by the toasting DJ King Stitt (\"Fire Corner\", \"Van Cleef\", \"Herbman Shuffle\"). Eccles recorded many organ-led instrumentals with his session band The Dynamites (same band has Derrick Harriott's ), featuring Jackie Jackson, Hux Brown, Paul Douglas, Winston Wright, Gladstone Anderson, Winston Grennan, Joe Isaacs, and Hugh Malcolm, with Johnny Moore and Bobby Ellis both contributing trumpet in defferent sessions. In 1970, Eccles helped pave the way to the dub music genre by releasing an instrumental version of \"Herbman Shuffle\" called \"Phantom\", with a mix focusing on the bass line.\n\nEccles launched different record labels for his works: Clansone, New Beat and Clandisc (the latter also the name of a sub-label set up by Trojan Records for Eccles' UK releases). He recorded artists such as Alton Ellis, Joe Higgs, the Trinidian Lord Creator (\"Kingston Town\"), Larry Marshall, Hemsley Morris, Earl Lawrence, The Beltones, Glen Ricks, Cynthia Richards, Buster Brown and Beres Hammond. Appreciated by musicians for his fairness and sense of equity, he helped Lee Perry set up his Upsetter record label in 1968 after Perry left Dodd's employment, and helped Winston 'Niney' Holmes (later known as 'The Observer') record his first hit as a producer in 1971 (\"Blood & Fire\").\n\nA socialist militant, Eccles was appointed as an adviser on the music industry to Michael Manley's People's National Party (PNP) and took part in Jamaica's 1972 prime ministerial elections by organising a \"Bandwagon\" featuring musicians such as Bob Marley & the Wailers, Dennis Brown, Max Romeo, Delroy Wilson and Inner Circle, performing around the island in support of Manley's campaign. Throughout the 1970s, he remained close to Manley and wrote several songs in praise of the PNP program, including his hits \"Power for the People\", \"Rod of Correction\" or \"Generation Belly\".\n\nEccles' political interests meant that he spent less time on music, although in the late 1970s, Eccles had further success as a producer with recordings by Tito Simon and Exuma the Obeah Man, as well as collaborations with King Tubby. After the 1970s, new Eccles recordings were rare, and he concentrated on live concert promotion and re-issues of his back catalogue. In the 1980s, Eccles slowed down his musical activities, and he never met success again, apart from a few political songs, such as \"Dem Mash Up The Country\" in 1985. Eccles died on 30 June 2005, in Spanish Town Hospital from complications of a heart attack.\n\nEccles' son, Clancy Eccles Jr., has followed his father into the music business, initially performing as simply \"Clancy\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2172812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172812", "title": "Imperial fora", "text": "Imperial fora\n\nThe Imperial fora (\"Fori Imperiali \" in Italian) are a series of monumental \"fora\" (public squares), constructed in Rome over a period of one and a half centuries, between 46 BC and 113 AD. The forums were the center of the Roman Republic and of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe Imperial forums, while not part of the Roman Forum, are located relatively close to each other. Julius Caesar was the first to build in this section of Rome and rearranged both the Forum and the Comitium, another forum type space designated for politics, to do so. These forums were the centres of politics, religion and economy in the ancient Roman Empire. \n\nDuring the early 20th century, Mussolini restored the Imperial Fora as part of his campaign to evoke and emulate the past glories of Ancient Rome. But he also built the Via dei Fori Imperiali across the middle of the site. The modern street and its heavy traffic has proved a source of damage to the buildings because of vibration and pollution. There have been a number of proposals to remove the road, but none have taken effect.\n\nJulius Caesar decided to construct a large forum bearing his name. This forum was inaugurated in 46 BC, although it was probably incomplete at this time and was finished later by Augustus.\n\nThe Forum of Caesar was constructed as an extension to the Roman Forum. The Forum was used as a replacement venue to the Roman Forum for public affairs as well as government; it was also designed as a celebration of Caesar's power. Caesar had placed, on the front of his forum, a temple devoted to \"Venus Genetrix\", since Caesar's family (gens Julia) claimed to descend by Venus through Aeneas. A statue of Caesar himself riding Bucephalus, the celebrated horse of Alexander the Great, was placed in front of the temple, to symbolise absolute power. This centralised vision corresponded to the ideological function, following the propaganda of the Hellenistic sanctuaries; also the choice of the Forum site carried a meaning: the future dictator didn't want to be far from the central power, represented in the Curia, seat of the Senate. In fact, not long before Caesar's death, the Senate agreed to reconstruct the Curia on the site.\n\nIn the battle of Philippi in 42 BC, in which Augustus and Mark Antony worked together and avenged Caesar's death, defeating the forces of Brutus and Cassius, Augustus vowed to build the Temple of Mars Ultor (\"Mars the Avenger\"). The incomplete forum was inaugurated, after 40 years of construction, in 2 BC, adding the second monumental square, the Forum of Augustus.\n\nThis new complex lies at right angles to the Forum of Caesar. The temple consists of a very tall wall, and this still distinguishes itself from the popular neighbourhood of Suburra. This high wall served as a firebreak, protecting the Forum area from the frequent conflagrations from which Rome suffered. The rectangular square has long deep porticos with a surface that widens into large semicircular exedras. \n\nRecently one more slightly smaller exedra was found south on the wall bordering the forum of Trajan. meaning that in sake of symmetry there must have been other exedra demolished to make room for the forum of Nerva, rising the number to 4 and not 2 exedras. This completely changes the layout for the south part of the forum of Augustus, meaning that it is much more similar to the forum of Trajan and a new theory for this southern part of the forum suggests that in fact there was a basilica between the 2 new exedras (like in the forum of Trajan). This supports the numerous ancient authors that tell us the forum was used as a court of law.\n\nThe entire decoration of the Forum was tightly connected to the ideology of Augustus. According to myth, Rome herself was born from the god Mars through Romulus. This forum was occupied by many plebeians as well as senators.\n\nIn 75 AD, the Temple of Peace, also known as the Forum of Vespasian, was built under Emperor Vespasian. Separated from the Forum of Augustus, the Forum of Caesar and the \"via dell\"' which connect the Roman Forum to the Subura, the temple faced the Velian Hill (in the direction of the Colosseum). The fact that this structure is not mentioned as having a civil function has prevented it from being classified as a true Forum. Therefore, the structure was simply identified as the Temple of Peace (\"Templum Pacis\") until the late Empire.\n\nThe shape of the square was also different: the temple was constructed as a large apsidal hall that opened up like an exedra at the bottom of the portico. A row of columns distinguished the portico from the temple. The central area was not paved like other fora and served as a garden, with pools and pedestals for statues, so that it was similar to an open-air museum. \n\nThe monument was built to celebrate the conquest of Jerusalem. One of the chambers opened at the end of the porticos housed the \"Forma Urbis Romae\", a marble map of ancient Rome, made in the Severan period (3rd century) by drawing on the marble slab that covered the wall. The wall is now part of the façade of the church of Santi Cosma e Damiano, where the holes used to mount the slabs of the map can still be seen. The Temple of Peace is also said to have housed the Menorah from Herod's Temple.\n\nDomitian decided to unify the previous complex and the free remaining irregular area, between the Temple of Peace and the Fora of Caesar and Augustus, and build another monumental forum which connected all of the other fora.\n\nThe limited space, partially occupied by one of the exedrae of the Forum of Augustus and by the \"via dell'Argileto\", obliged Domitian to build the lateral porticos as simply decorations of the bounding walls of the forum. The temple, dedicated to Minerva as protector of the emperor, was built leaning on the exedra of the Forum of Augustus, so that the remaining space became a large monumental entrance (\"Porticus Absidatus\") for all the fora.\n\nBecause of the death of Domitian, the forum was inaugurated by his successor, Nerva, who gave his own name to it. The Forum of Nerva is also known as Transitional Forum, because it worked as an access way, just like \"via dell'Argileto\" had done.\n\nIt is probable that Domitian's projects were more ambitious than the building of the small \"Forum of Nerva\", and probably under his reign they started to remove the small saddle that united the Capitoline Hill to the Quirinal Hill, thus blocking the Fora towards Campus Martius, near to modern Piazza Venezia.\n\nThe project was resumed by Trajan with the construction of Trajan's Forum between 112 and 113. The occasion was the conquest of Dacia, whose spoils paid for this celebration of the military conquests of Rome.\n\nThe preparation of the Forum required a lot of work. It was necessary to remove the hilly saddle, and to support the cut of Quirinal Hill through the building of Trajan's market. The Forum square was closed by the Basilica Ulpia, with Trajan's Column at its back. In front of the basilica, a monumental façade was the background of a large, equestrian sculpture of the Emperor. The last Forum was also the biggest and greatest.\n\nIn 2007, a museum dedicated to the Imperial Fora was opened in the Trajan's Markets, which once constituted the northern edge of the Forum of Trajan. The new museum, named \"Museo dei Fori Imperiali\" (English: Museum of Imperial Fora) by the means of sculptures, videos, architectural pieces, and scale models depicts the history of the four forums and the Temple of Peace. \n\n"}

They were invented by Michael Luby in 1998 and published in 2002. Like some other fountain codes, LT codes depend on sparse bipartite graphs to trade reception overhead for encoding and decoding speed. The distinguishing characteristic of LT codes is in employing a particularly simple algorithm based on the exclusive or operation (formula_1) to encode and decode the message.\n\nLT codes are \"rateless\" because the encoding algorithm can in principle produce an infinite number of message packets (i.e., the percentage of packets that must be received to decode the message can be arbitrarily small). They are \"erasure correcting codes\" because they can be used to transmit digital data reliably on an erasure channel.\n\nThe next generation beyond LT codes are Raptor codes (see for example IETF RFC 5053 or IETF RFC 6330), which have linear time encoding and decoding. Raptor codes use two encoding stages for encoding, where the second stage is an LT encoding.\nInformation about availability of an efficient software implementation of the RaptorQ code specified in IETF RFC 6330 (the most advanced fountain code), can be found at the\nwebsite for the Codornices project at ICSI .\n\nThe traditional scheme for transferring data across an erasure channel depends on continuous two-way communication.\n\nCertain networks, such as ones used for cellular wireless broadcasting, do not have a feedback channel. Applications on these networks still require reliability. Fountain codes in general, and LT codes in particular, get around this problem by adopting an essentially one-way communication protocol.\n\nThe encoding process begins by dividing the uncoded message into \"n\" blocks of roughly equal length. Encoded packets are then produced with the help of a pseudorandom number generator.\n\n\nThis process continues until the receiver signals that the message has been received and successfully decoded.\n\nThe decoding process uses the \"exclusive or\" operation to retrieve the encoded message.\n\nThis decoding procedure works because \"A\" formula_1 \"A\" = 0 for any bit string \"A\". After \"d\" − 1 distinct blocks have been exclusive-ored into a packet of degree \"d\", the original unencoded content of the unmatched block is all that remains. In symbols we have\n\nSeveral variations of the encoding and decoding processes described above are possible. For instance, instead of prefixing each packet with a list of the actual message block indices {\"i\", \"i\", …, \"i\"}, the encoder might simply send a short \"key\" which served as the seed for the pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) or index table used to construct the list of indices. Since the receiver equipped with the same RNG or index table can reliably recreate the \"random\" list of indices from this seed, the decoding process can be completed successfully. Alternatively, by combining a simple LT code of low average degree with a robust error-correcting code, a raptor code can be constructed that will outperform an optimized LT code in practice.\n\nThere is only one parameter that can be used to optimize a straight LT code: the degree distribution function (described as a pseudorandom number generator for the degree \"d\" in the LT encoding section above). In practice the other \"random\" numbers (the list of indices { \"i\", \"i\", …, \"i\" } ) are invariably taken from a uniform distribution on [0, \"n\"), where \"n\" is the number of blocks into which the message has been divided.\n\nLuby himself discussed the \"ideal soliton distribution\" defined by\n\nThis degree distribution theoretically minimizes the expected number of redundant code words that will be sent before the decoding process can be completed. However the ideal soliton distribution does not work well in practice because any fluctuation around the expected behavior makes it likely that at some step in the decoding process there will be no available packet of (reduced) degree 1 so decoding will fail. Furthermore, some of the original blocks will not be xor-ed into any of the transmission packets. Therefore, in practice, a modified distribution, the \"robust soliton distribution\", is substituted for the ideal distribution. The effect of the modification is, generally, to produce more packets of very small degree (around 1) and fewer packets of degree greater than 1, except for a spike of packets at a fairly large quantity chosen to ensure that all original blocks will be included in some packet.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2172844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172844", "title": "Mr. Lady Records", "text": "Mr. Lady Records\n\nMr. Lady Records (or Mr. Lady Records and Video) was a San Francisco-based lesbian-feminist independent record label and video art distributor. Artists on the label included Le Tigre and The Butchies. \"OutSmart\" magazine noted that Mr. Lady was \"queercore's strongest label.\"\n\nThe label was founded in 1996 in Durham, North Carolina by musician Kaia Wilson and artist/UNC photography professor Tammy Rae Carland, aiming to redress what they saw as a lack of feminist record labels at the time. As well as a range of recording artists, the label was also heavily involved in other events that promoted feminist thinking and music, such as the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival – which led to some controversy in 1999 – and various art showcases. Mr. Lady closed down in June 2004.\n\nKaia Wilson was a member of lesbian punk group The Butchies, and felt their \"out politics held them back.\" Without a record company to specifically represent the work of herself and other \"out\" female musicians, Wilson and her girlfriend, Tammy Rae Carland, found their opportunities limited. Subsequently, they formed Mr. Lady to redress the \"lack of enough women and/or dyke run record labels,\" which they felt led to an \"extremely limited amount of affordable and accessible means for independent artists to distribute their work.\" Thus, Mr. Lady Records was started with, in Wilson's words, \"$35 and a lotta...faith.\"\n\nWilson stated the name \"Mr. Lady\" came from a trip to Italy while on tour with Team Dresch: \"I saw a store called Mr. Baby, and it freaked me out. Then everyone started calling me Mr. Baby. Then I became Mr. Baby onstage. I had my own theme song and everything. I wore a little eyeliner mustache. From there it changed into Mr. Lady, which just seemed like a good name for a queer label.\" It also related to \"Ladyman\", Wilson's first solo LP, produced with the aid of Melissa York after they both left lesbian \"supergroup\" Team Dresch.\n\nMr. Lady Records released recordings by groups such as Kathleen Hanna's lo-fi group Le Tigre (who released their first two records – \"Le Tigre\" and \"Feminist Sweepstakes\" – with Mr. Lady), punk group The Butchies (of whom Kaia Wilson is the lead singer), British group Electrelane, Tara Jane O'Neil, spoken-word collective Sister Spit (Sini Anderson and Michelle Tea), and others. In March 2001, \"Calling All Kings & Queens\", a sampler album, was released which featured eighteen tracks from various artists and friends of the label, including Sleater-Kinney and Team Dresch. It followed 1999's \"New Women's Music Sampler\".\n\nNo band that signed with Mr. Lady contained a male artist. Carland said \"It's not that we're necessarily never going to put out a band with men in it, but it's just kind of organically happened that way. We wanted to focus on putting out music by women. We do consider ourselves a feminist business and part of that involves prioritizing work made by women.\"\n\nDue to their work with Mr. Lady, Wilson and Carland were described as two of the \"100 most influential gay people in the world\" by About.com in 2002.\n\nAlthough initially a vehicle for Wilson to release her own albums, Mr. Lady grew into a label whose musical and political contributions gained national attention. During a review of Tami Hart's debut release with Mr. Lady, online magazine \"PopMatters\" described the label as \"one of the bright spots in new music. Whether the groups or singers are punk or indie, they are all anti-mainstream hip, political, and good – really good.\" \"Discorder\" magazine described the label in 2004 as \"lead[ing] the way when it came to releasing music that was as politically significant as it was danceable.\"\n\nInitially distributing music through mail order, the label signed a deal to distribute records nationally across the US in 2001.

In response to a request from transgender activists to boycott the festival, Mr. Lady released a statement which defended the festival, believing that they did not consider an event for \"womyn born womyn\" and the transgender community to be mutually exclusive, but backed the right of the festival to exclude those not born as women.\n\nKaia Wilson confirmed this in a June 1999 statement: \"[W]e strongly believe that transgender/transsexual people are an important part of the queer community and that they face an enormous amount of opposition. [...] We know that the MWMF started as a separatist event for womyn born womyn and we personally still feel the continued need for that kind of space and event. [...] We don't think that our support of the trans communities and womyn born womyn communities are in direct contradiction to each other.\"\n\nFormally backing the festival's trans-exclusion policy led to protests and boycotts aimed towards Mr. Lady acts, Wilson and The Butchies in particular. Groups such as Camp Trans, and many participants in the queercore community disagreed with Mr. Lady's stance and felt that the group and label exploited transgender images. The label went defunct in June 2004.\n\nMr. Lady Records has sponsored numerous showcases of feminist and lesbian music, including events at the Weisman Art Museum at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities campus in Minneapolis, Minnesota (working with the Queer Student Cultural Center) and \"Mr. Sister\", a showcase at the National Queer Arts Festival in 2003 at the Center for Lesbian Gay Bi Transgender Art & Culture in San Francisco.\n\nArtists formerly on Mr. Lady include:\n\n\n\n"}

There is no known historical evidence regarding either his birthplace or date, nor any known reference to it in his works. Some wrongly believe that he disappeared in 1768. Yet his \"Aisvarya-kadambini\" is dated 1779 (year 1701 of Shaka era). The original manuscript is preserved at the City Palace in Jaipur. While his birth date is unknown, a document preserved at the Jaipur Archives dated the fourteenth day of the Bhadra month of Saṁvat 1850 (nineteenth of September, 1793 AD) describes his ceremony of condolence presided by King Pratap Singh of Jaipur (ruled 1778-1803 AD). On the basis of this evidence, it is unrealistic to assume that he was born much before 1700 AD.\nThe earliest documents that mention Vidyabhusana belong to the 1740s. According to oral tradition, he was born in Odisha (possibly near Remuna, Balasore). Yet it is not clear when and how this oral tradition started. The first mention to it in written form was not earlier than late 19th century.\n\nAlso according to oral tradition, at an early age he received a thorough education in grammar, poetry, rhetoric and logic. After concluding his studies, he went on a pilgrimage to various place in India. According to Vidyabhusana's statement at the end of his Siddhanta-ratna, he had been previously initiated in the Madhva-sampradaya before becoming a follower of the philosophy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. When he visited Jagannatha Puri (Odisha), he met Sri Radha-Damodara Deva, a grand-disciple of Sri Rasikananda Deva, with whom he discussed philosophy. Sri Radha-Damodara Deva explained the conclusions of Gaudiya Vaishnava Theology as expounded by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Moved by those teachings, Baladeva was initiated and began to study the Sat-sandarbhas of Sri Jiva Gosvami.\n\nIn a short time he became experienced in Gaudiya Vaisnava philosophy. With his guru's permission and blessings, he moved to Sri Vrindavana (Vrindavan) to study these teachings under Sri Visvanatha Chakravarti Thakura. Baladeva fully accepted the Gaudiya Vaisnava philosophy and became a powerful exponent of this system.\n\nHis first known work was a commentary on the Vedanta-sutra or Brahma-sutra, entitled Brahma-sutra-karika-bhasya. It was composed by Vidyabhusana under the order of King Sawai Jai Singh II (1688-1743 AD), as mentioned at the beginning and the end of the manuscript. The work is not dated, but from the available historical documentation, it can be inferred that it was written between 1730 and 1740 AD. This was the Vedanta commentary that Vidyabhusana wrote very quickly in order to appease the King and the opponents who belittled the Gaudiyas for not having a Brahma-sutra-bhasya. The much more famous Govinda-bhasya was a much later and more elaborate work, and its oldest known manuscript is dated Saṁvat 1815 (1758 AD).\n\nSome claim that Baladeva received the title \"Vidyabhusana\" from the King or from the Ramanandis. However, the Karika-bhasya manuscript and his other earlier manuscripts are signed \"Vidyabhusana.\" He may have received this title before joining the Gaudiyas, probably when he was a Tattvavadi debater. Another of his earlier works was the Tattva-dipika, also written under the order of Sawai Jai Singh II.\n\nSome misinformed individuals also claim that the Govinda-bhasya was written at Galta, to which there is not the slightest evidence and which makes no sense at all, as according to documentary evidence, even during Sawai Jai Singh II Vidyabhusana was the Mahant of the New Govinda-deva Temple in Vrindavan as well as of his own temple in Jaipur, and the idea that he left his duties in both places to sit down in a temple of another sampradaya to write a commentary is nothing but absurd.\n\nThe earliest documents that mention Baladeva Vidyabhusana belong to the 1740s, therefore it is most unlikely that he had any participation in the Amer/Jaipur debates before the 1730s.\n\nOther works include Siddhanta-ratnam (Govinda-bhasya-pithakam), Prameya-ratnavali, Siddhanta-darpana, Kavya-kaustubha, Vyakarana-kaumudi, Pada-kaustubha, Isadi-upanisad bhasya, Gitabhusana-bhasya, Sri Visnunama-sahasra-nama-bhasya, Sanksepa-bhagavatamrta- tippani, Tattva-sandarbha-tika, Stava-mala-vibhusana-bhasya, Nataka-candrika-tika, Candraloka-tika, Sahitya-kaumudi, Srimad-Bhagavata-tika (Vaisnavanandini).\n\nAn important story attached to Sri Baladeva concerns his writing of the Vedanta commentary, his first known work. The Vaishnava sect known as Ramanandi sect allegedly complained that because the Gaudiya Vaisnavas had no commentary on the Vedanta Sutra, they were not qualified to worship the Deity and therefore the worship should be turned over to them. They also objected to the worship of Srimati Radharani along with Sri Krishna because they were not authorized anywhere in the shastras.\n\nThe Ramanandis informed King Sawai Jai Singh II at Jaipur, Rajasthan who sent word to Vrindavana informing the devotees what had happened. At that time Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti was very aged so in his place, he sent his student, Sri Baladeva. Despite his strong arguments, the scholars in the assembly refused to accept anything other than a direct commentary on the sutra. Having no other recourse, Baladeva promised to present them with one. Sri Baladeva sought solace at Sri Govindaji's mandira (temple) in Jaipur. Feeling aggrieved, he informed Sri Govinda of everything that had happened. Legend has it that the Lord came to Sri Baladeva that night in a dream and told him to write the Vedanta sutra. Invigorated, Sri Baladeva began to write, and quickly completed the task.\n\nImpressed with the commentary, the Ramanandis expressed their desire to accept initiation from Sri Baladeva Vidyabhushana. However, he declined their request by stating that among the four authorized sampradayas, the Sri sampradaya was highly respectable and the foremost adherent of Dasya-bhakti (devotion in servitorship).\n\nReturning from Jaipur to Vrindavana, Sri Baladeva presented the certificate of victory to Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura and narrated the events that had transpired. Cakravartipada bestowed his full blessings on Sri Baladeva. At this time, Sri Baladeva Vidyabhushana began to write a commentary on Srila Jiva Gosvami's Sat-sandarbha.\n\nSri Vijaya Govinda, residing at Gokulananda Mandira in Vrindavana, is said to have been worshiped by Baladeva Vidyabhushana personally. According to the opinion of some devotees, Sri Baladeva Vidyabhushana installed the large Deities Sri Radha-Syamasundara.\n\nAfter the departure of Sri Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura Sri Baladeva Vidyabhushana became the next acharya of the Gaudiya Vaisnava sampradaya.\n\nHe had two well-known disciples, Sri Uddhava dasa and Sri Nanda Misra.\n\nHis samadhi is located on the back side of Sri-Sri-Radha-Shyamsundar Temple, Sevakunj, Vrindavan.\n\n\n"}

He introduced some modern teaching methods in Iran, especially in teaching the alphabet. These are still used to some degree in Iran's primary schools.\n\nHassan Roshdieh was an ethnic Iranian Azerbaijani and began studying as a Twelver Shi'a cleric there, Roshdieh abandoned his plans of going to Najaf to study in religious schools after reading an article about the hardships of education in the Persian language from the newspaper \"Akhtar\". He left for Beirut in 1880 and studied for two years in its \"Daar ul-Mu'allimeen\" (teacher school), and then continued with visiting Istanbul and Egypt. In 1883, he left for Yerevan and founded the first modern school for Muslims there. In his new method of teaching, Roshdieh used the concept of sounds instead of alphabetic letters to teach the Persian and Azeri languages, which use the Arabic script. During his four years of managing his school in Yerevan, Roshdieh wrote \"Vatan Dili\" (\"The Language of the Homeland\") in Azerbaijani, which was taught in several schools of the Caucasus as a primer until the October Revolution.\n\nIt was during his stay in Yerevan that Roshdieh met Nasser-al-Din Shah, who took him to Nakhichevan. Roshdieh later return to his birthplace in Tabriz, where he established the first primary schools in Iran in 1886 or 1887. While Ahmad Kasravi has claimed in his book that the primary school were established with the help of Ali Khan Amin od-Dowle, the then Premier of Iran, this cannot be confirmed by the records of Fakhreddin Roshdieh, Mirza Hassan's son.\n\nThe schools were highly rejected by the more conservative Tabrizis, specially clerics, alleging that Roshdieh is trying to make the students quit Islam, mentioning the school ring and its similarity to church bells. This resulted in mobs destroying some of his schools (which resulted in a few students being killed or injured), unsuccessful assassination attempts using guns, and later a \"fatwa\" against the modern schools, which finally resulted in him fleeing Tabriz.\n\nIn Tehran, and during the reign of Mozzafar-al-Din Shah and the prime ministership of Amin od-Dowle, Roshdieh started the \"Roshdieh School\" with the help of the government. He was a member of the political \"Ma'āref Association\" and active for the fight for freedoms and constitution during the Iranian Constitutional Revolution, leading to him being exiled or fleeing Iran a few times.\n\nAfter a final return to Iran, Roshdieh established a new school and a magazine in 1904, both called \"Maktab\". He finally quit his political and educational activities in 1927 and moved to Qom, where he died in 1944 and is buried.\n\nRoshdieh is claimed to be the first Azerbaijani to write poems for children. He also had plans for education of the blind people and had helped establishing girl schools in Iran. He has several books and articles in Persian and Azerbaijani. He was called Roshdieh after the name of primary schools in the then Ottoman empire, \"roshdiyye\", because he had established the first such schools in Iran.\n\nRoshdieh is mentioned in a famous poem of Nima Youshij, \"yād-e ba’zi nafarāt\" (\"The Memory of Some People\").\n\n"}

It had in 2013 a population of 14,334 inhabitants.\n\nGaillac is a town situated between Toulouse, Albi and Montauban. It has gained much recognition due to the wines that bear the town's name. The Tarn river runs along the border of the town by the south, east and west. It lies 50 km north-east of Toulouse. It is a market town and is the commercial centre of the north-west of Tarn.\n\nThe local wine of Gaillac, first made almost two thousand years ago, is of two official appellations (AOC). The terroir is made up of clay, limestone, sand and silex soils. Gaillac receives more sunshine than Bordeaux and is graced by a cool maritime climate. Duras is the name both of the grape that is native to this area and of an AOC and town just northwest of the two \"Gaillac\" designations.\n\nThe town was founded in the second century CE by the Gauls who created a river port where they exported their wine into Gallia Narbonensis. When Aquitania was conquered by Rome, Gaillac gained prosperity with its wine. However, the barbarian invasions annihilated the town and left nothing behind. It was only when the monks of Saint-Michel gained viticulture privileges from the Bishop of Albi, in 972, that the population stabilized and Gaillac started to become a town again. Their wines were at first sent to Bordeaux where they would be exported to England. The Abbey of St. Michel was constructed in the 10th century and rebuilt in 1271. In 1524 the abbey was secularized but the title of abbey retained.\n\nDuring the religious wars, the \"Gaillacois\" refused to change their religion and remained Catholics and were chased out of the town by Protestants. They took refuge at Castelnau-de-Montmiral. After the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre on 24 August 1572, in Paris, the Gaillacois massacred 74 out of the 90 Huguenots in the town. The abbey was once again rebuilt between 1572-1620. In the seventeenth century the Chateau of Foucaud was erected.\n\nIt was from the town of Gaillac that Louis-Philippe I addressed the words:\n\nNous chercherons à nous tenir dans un juste milieu, également éloigné des excès du pouvoir populaire et des abus du pouvoir royal.\nWhich may be translated: \"We seek to keep ourselves in proper state, aloof from both the excesses of popular power and the abuses of royal power.\" This sentence would define the July Monarchy.\n\nThe mayors of the town have been:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Initially, these reforms were not broadly adopted when they were proposed but gradually became popular into the early 20th century. \n\nFollowing the establishment of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935, the government selected Tagalog as basis for a \"national language\" (i.e. Filipino). Following this, the development of a dictionary and grammar book for this \"national language\" started. In 1939, Lope K.

His death was allegedly caused by spontaneous human combustion.\n\nBentley was last seen alive 4 December 1966, when friends visiting his home wished him good night at about 9 p.m. The following morning, meter reader Don Gosnell let himself into Bentley's house, as he had permission to do due to Bentley's infirmity, and went to the basement to check the meter. While in the basement, Gosnell noticed a strange smell and a light blue smoke. He explained the smoke to be \"somewhat sweet, like starting up a new oil-burning central heating system\". On the ground was a neat pile of ash, about 35 centimetres in height. The floor underneath the ash was unmarked. Had he looked up, he would've seen a hole about a foot long square in the floor boards above. Intrigued, he went upstairs to investigate. The bedroom was smoky and in the bathroom he found Bentley's cremated remains. \n\nAll that was left of the aged doctor was the lower half of his right leg with the slipper still on it. The rest of his body had been reduced to a pile of ashes in the basement below. His walker lay across the hole in the floor generated by the fire. The rubber tips on it were still intact and the nearby bathtub was barely scorched. Gosnell ran from the building to get help. He reached the gas company office screaming \"Doctor Bentley's burned up!\" to his colleagues. Later on, his colleagues said: \"he looked as white as a sheet\".\n\nThe first theory put forward was that Bentley had set himself on fire with his pipe, but his pipe was still on its stand by the bed in the next room. Perplexed, the coroner could only record a verdict of 'death by asphyxiation and 90 percent burning of the body.' \n\nJoe Nickell, in his book \"Secrets of the Supernatural\", gives an account of this event he got from Larry E. Arnold's article \"The Flaming Fate of Dr. John Irving Bentley,\" printed in the Pursuit of Fall 1976. Nickell mentions that the hole in the bathroom floor measured 2½ feet by 4 feet, and details the remains as being Bentley's lower leg burned off at the knee. \n\nNickell mentions that Bentley's robe was found smoldering in the bathtub next to the hole, and that the broken remains of \"what was apparently a water pitcher\" were found in the toilet; he adds that the doctor had dropped hot ashes from his pipe onto his clothing previously (which \"were dotted with burn spots from previous incidents\"), and that he kept wooden matches in his pockets which could transform a small ember into a blazing flame. \n\nNickell believes that Bentley woke up to find his clothes on fire, walked to the bathroom, and passed out before he could extinguish the flames. Then, he suggests that the burning clothes ignited the flammable linoleum floor, and cool air drawn from the basement in what is known as \"the stack effect\" kept the fire burning hotly.\n\n\n"}

The Hilbert space spanned by the states before collision (in states) is equal to the space spanned by the states after collision (out states) which are both Fock spaces if there is a mass gap. This is the reason why the S matrix which maps the in states onto the out states must be unitary. The scattering channel are also called scattering asymptotes. The Møller operators are mapping the scattering channels onto the corresponding states which are solution of the Schrödinger equation taking the interaction Hamiltonian into account. The Møller operators are isometric.\n"}

Bezirk, Favoriten\"), is located south of the central districts. It is south of Innere Stadt, Wieden and Margareten. Favoriten is a heavily populated urban area with many residential buildings, but also large recreational areas and parks.\n\nThe name comes from \"Favorita\", a semi-baroque palace complex that once served as a hunting castle but today is the Theresianum a gymnasium (secondary school) in the 4th district (Wieden). The customs facilities at the original southern border of Vienna were known as the \"Favoriten-Linie\" (Favoriten Line) while nearby houses were known as the \"Siedlung vor der Favoriten-Linie\" (Settlement in front of the Favoriten Line).\n\nThe Favoriten District includes 6 sections: Katastralgemeinden Favoriten, Inzersdorf-Stadt, Rothneusiedl, Unterlaa, Oberlaa-Stadt and Oberlaa-Land, as well as small parts of the 2 sections Katastralgemeinden Kaiserebersdorf and Simmering.\n\nThe northern part of the district is the historical Favoriten (Workers District), a grid-patterned residential area with many houses over 100 years old, plus intermediate industries (such as the complex of Ankerbrot AG). On the western edge of the district are two contrasting developments, opposite each other: during the inter-war period, George Washington Court was built (as a stylish Gemeindebau); and during 1990-2000, Business Park Vienna was built, including Vienna Twin Towers (skyscrapers), bounded on the south, by the forty-years-older Philipshaus on Trieste Street, in the architecture of classical Modernism.\nThe district is bordered by the districts Meidling to the west, Liesing to the southwest, Margareten and Wieden to the north, and Simmering to the east. The \"Südbahn\" serves Favoriten in the north and Vienna Main Station, which lies in the northeast of the district. The rail line forms the northern border of the district running by the foot of the \"Wienerberg\" (Vienna Mountain) before turning southwards past \"Laaer Berg\" (Laa Mountain) to \"Liesingtal\" (Liesing Valley), where the Lower Austrian towns of Hennersdorf, Leopoldsdorf and Schwechat are.\n\nIn 1874, the former settlement of Favoriten was annexed by Vienna as the 10th district. The first district director was the well-known Johann Steudel, who ran a tavern in the former settlement. The district expanded its borders quickly as industries and the associated housing grew in the area. After World War II, Vienna was divided into quarters and split among the Allies, and Favoriten belonged to the Soviet-occupied sector. Favoriten was last expanded in 1954, when the former villages of Rothneusiedl, Oberlaa and Unterlaa were annexed to the district.\nIn 1869, the current area covered by the Favoriten District included only 22,340 inhabitants. Due to the huge influx of workers in the district area up to the beginning of the First World War, the district population increased 7-fold up to 1910 as 159,241 inhabitants. Thereafter, the district's population declined until the 30s, fell during the Second World War, but for the next 40 years gradually increased. Unlike many downtown districts, the population numbers grew in the 50s and 60s again, as the district had sufficient land area for new buildings, which expanded due to the housing demand. From the '70s, the population began to stagnate; however, since 2001, the number of inhabitants has increased significantly and, at the beginning of 2007, amounted to 169,578 people.\n\nThe age of the population in Favoriten from 2001 is average for Vienna. The number of children under 15 years was 14.6%, against the Vienna area average of 14.7%. The proportion of the population 15 to 59 years was 62.6% (Vienna: 63.6%), only slightly below average. This showed particularly in the younger population deficits, while the number of people aged 60 or more years with 22.8%, was above the value of Vienna (21.7%). The gender distribution in the district area was 47.7% men and 52.8% women, the number of Favoriten marriages had a share of 42.9% compared to 41.2%, above the average of Vienna.\n\nThe proportion of foreign-district residents in 2016 was 32,8 % (Vieanna-citywide 27,4 %), an increase over 2001 (16.5%) as in the entire State, as a rising trend. The highest proportion of foreigners, in 2005, was represented with a 5.5% share of the district population, as nationals from Serbia and Montenegro. Another 3.9% were Turkish, Bosnian 1.6%, Polish 1.3%, Croatian 1.2% and 0.6% German citizens. In total, for 2001, 23.7% of the population of Favoriten were not born in Austria. Nearly 6.8% expressed as a colloquial language Serbian, but Turkish 7.4% and 2.6% Croatian.\n\nThe religion of the population in the Favoriten District, in the 2001 census, had a proportion of Muslim population higher than the average of Vienna. In 2001, 47.0% of the inhabitants had membership to the Roman Catholic Church (Vienna citywide: 49.2%). There were 15 Roman Catholic parishes, the City Deanery had 10 images. Nearly 11.2% of residents were Islamic faith (Vienna citywide: 7.8%), 6.4% belonged to the Orthodox Church, and 4.1% were Protestant. Nearly 26.5% of the district population, however, belonged to no religious group, and 4.9% had no religion or other preference given.\n\nFavoriten is the most populous of the districts of Vienna. Most of Favoriten's residential area is composed of a variety of houses, that are over 100 years old, as well as community housing developments (such as the Hansson-Siedlung). The district also has numerous industries. There are recreational areas in the southern part of the district, such as the \"Kurpark Laaer Berg\" (Treatment Park of Laa Mountain), which, in 1974, joined the \"Kurzentrum Oberlaa\" (Treatment Centre of Upper Laa), a sulphur springs, and the recreational centre at Wienerberg. On the north side of Laaer Berg, a small theme park, the Böhmischer Prater, was built in 1882. Furthermore, the Ernst Kirchweger Haus (EKH), a squatted social centre, is situated in Favoriten.\n\nFavoriten is home to the stadium of one of the most successful Austrian Bundesliga teams FK Austria Wien, who play at the Generali Arena. Favoriten is also home to a smaller club which came to prominence in the 80's Favoritner AC.\n\nAs a labour district Favoriten is traditional political stamped Social Democratic so that the Socialists are represented with the District Director since 1946 all the time. \nCommonly the SPÖ reached the absolute majority, which was only in danger after the rise of the FPÖ at the end of the eighties under Jörg Haider.\n1996 the FPÖ increased 8.6% and the absolute majority of the SPÖ was broken the first time.\nThrough the downfall of the FPÖ the revanche came in 2001 and the Socialists regained the absolute majority. \n2010 the SPÖ lost nearly 10% the FPÖ took most advantage of this and also increased by 14%. The ÖVP makes no odds here and reached in average not more than 12%. \nAlso the Greens are under their average percent of voters here.\nAt the district election 2010 all parliament parties lost except for FPÖ and BZÖ.\n\nThe coat of arms of the 10th district is a shield divided into six parts: \n\n\n"}

He had two sisters, Tzila and Shoshanna. Feinberg studied in France. He then returned to work with Aaron Aaronsohn at the agronomy research station in Atlit. Soon after the beginning of war, the four Aaronsohn siblings (Sarah Aaronsohn, Rivka, Alex, and Aaron) founded the Nili underground along with Feinberg. They were later joined by Yosef Lishansky and others. In 1915 Feinberg traveled to Egypt and made contact with British Naval Intelligence. In 1917, Feinberg again journeyed to Egypt, on foot. He was apparently killed on his way back by a group of Bedouins near the British front in Sinai, close to Rafah. His fate was unknown until after the 1967 Six-Day War when his remains were found under a palm tree that had grown from date seeds in his pocket to mark the spot where he lay.\n\nIn 1979 a new Israeli settlement in the Sinai Peninsula, Avshalom, was named after him.

The unexpected clash, and the deaths of 44 SAF police as well as the wounding of 12 others, triggered bitter recriminations amongst leaders at the national level and threatened to derail on-going reconciliation negotiations between the Philippines Government and various rebel groups in Mindanao. It was reported that members of both the MILF as well as the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) were involved in the action on the rebel side. In response to the clash and deaths of national police, President Aquino called for the peace talks with MILF to nevertheless continue but also demanded that MILF forces assist in identifying the persons responsible for killing the police and, in other ways, demonstrate sincerity in supporting the peace efforts.\n\nSubsequently, it was reported that both the Philippines government and local MILF representatives were working to try to restore life to normal in the Mamasapano area. Representatives of the Philippines government visited the area in early February to deliver assistance to families who had lost relatives during the fighting. Representatives of the MILF also issued assurances that on-going efforts to establish peace in the region would not be disrupted by the clash. Nevertheless, in the following weeks local fighting continued between government forces and the BIFF rebel group. In early March government forces were reported to have captured a BIFF camp where bombs and weapons were being manufactured.\n\n"}

It consisted of a Junior Department and Senior Department, providing education for pupils up to age 16.\n\nIn 2010, St Ursula's went into administration after it became financially unviable due to falling pupil numbers. It was temporarily saved by the Bristol City Council, which bought the school site, and Oasis Community Learning, a subsidiary of the Oasis Trust. This led to the opening of Oasis School Westbury as an interim measure during the 2010/2011 academic year. Oasis Community Learning operated the school with a one-year lease and closed it in July 2011.\n\nAt the start of the 2011/2012 academic year, Bristol Council allocated the site to St Ursula's E-ACT Academy, the first primary academy in Bristol.\n\nIn January 2015, St Ursula's was given a good rating by Ofsted which remains sponsored by E-ACT \n\nThe school was named after St. Ursula, the patron saint of young girls and students. It was opened in 1896 by the Sisters of Mercy, St. Ursula's was originally a girls' boarding school. The school stopped accepting boarders in 1927. During the Second World War, the cellars served as air raid shelters to the population of Henleaze and in 1942 the school was bombed and evacuated. Much of the school was destroyed by the bombing, but was re-built in 1948.\n\nIn 1972 the school underwent major changes when the convent was converted into classrooms and subject rooms. Also in 1972, the Board of Governors took responsibility for the strategic management and policies operated by the school, including its financial affairs and facilities. In 1986, the Gym/Sports Hall for Games Lessons and the community was opened, after contributions from parents. The school retained close links with the Sacred Heart Catholic Church positioned at the rear of the school but lessons were not taught by the nuns after 1988, when the Sisters of Mercy withdrew from independent education in the UK and the school was taken over by an educational trust.\n\nThe first lay headmistress was Margaret McNaughton who served until 2005. Under her leadership the school began to accept boys, first in the Junior School and then in the Senior Department in 1996. At this time the Sixth Form was closed due to inadequate numbers. In 2005, Lynette Carter, who previously had served as Senior Mistress of the Junior Department, took over as Headmistress. She continued as headteacher when the school became Oasis Westbury.\n\nFacing falling pupil numbers, in early 2010 St. Ursula's expressed interest in moving to the state sector as an Academy.\nThis did not come to fruition, and as the Trustees were unable to find a purchaser who could take the school on as a going concern, Grant Thornton were appointed as administrators. In August 2010 they announced that the school would close.\n\nOasis Community Learning took it over with a one-year lease from the council and said that they wanted to run an all-through academy on the site or at least a primary academy. However the bids failed and education provider E-ACT were chosen to run a primary only academy on the site. Oasis School Westbury closed on 15 July 2011.\n\nOn the creation of Oasis School Westbury, parents of St. Ursula's pupils formed the Parents' Action Group (PAG). This group tried to save the school, first by supporting Oasis and then by putting in their own free school application bid. When rejection of the PAG/Oasis bids was announced, some parents formed a new group, Bristol Children First. This group aimed to save their school by negotiating with the Bristol Free School (BFS) Trust, which comprised a local parents' group called Parents' Voice and the Russell Education Trust.\n\nThe BFS Trust wanted to run their own secondary free school on the St. Ursula's site. They were originally in competition with both Oasis and PAG, but were progressing faster towards Department for Education approval. They applied to the DfE to alter the business case for their proposal to extend it from Secondary to all-through provision, but were not successful in doing so. BFS was eventually approved to open as a Secondary school, and was allocated an alternative temporary site in Brentry. The BFS Trust hoped to move the school to the St. Ursula's site in 2012, but its bid to do that was unsuccessful.\n\nBFS opened in September 2011 with Year 7 only, so was unable to accommodate pupils from St. Ursula's who were entering Year 8 or above. Primary pupils from the original St. Ursula's school were accommodated at St Ursula's E-ACT Academy, which also opened in September 2011, and therefore were able to remain at the original St. Ursula's site.\n\nPAG submitted another secondary free school bid in 2013 to cater for senior pupils at the St. Ursula's site. In the meantime the St. Ursula's E-ACT Academy said it would consider expanding to provide Secondary places if there was enough parental demand.\n\nThe school's badge and motto was known as the Mercy Shield or Misericordia Shield and is the insignia of the Order of the Sisters of Mercy. It has been a symbol of mercy since the thirteenth century. The motto 'Dominus Illuminatio Mea' is Latin for 'The Lord is my Light'. The Saint Ursula’s Serviam badge is a field of seven stars representing The Little Bear Constellation, known as Ursa Minor.\n\nThe main building is large with a clock tower. It is a Grade II listed building. There was a sports hall and large playing fields, a forest area and a small garden behind in an estate covering a total of . There were a number of \"quads\" around the school, some with religious statues and gardens. On the top floor of the school (with the little single square windows) were the old rooms where the boarders used to sleep. They also used to sleep in rooms along the corridor which later housed the kitchen, offices and the senior department library. At the front of the school, next to the main gate, there is a graveyard for the nuns of the Sisters of Mercy.\n"}

He received one dollar and an economical remuneration for a lawsuit that he established against Félix Trinidad Sr. in Chicago, Illinois. The lawsuit is still to be decided.\n\nRamos helped Oquendo get title shots against Chris Byrd, who beat Oquendo by a twelve-round decision for the IBF world Heavyweight title, and against John Ruiz, who knocked Oquendo out in the eleventh round for the WBA world Heavyweight title, the latter fight being also being held at the Madison Square Garden and becoming the first time two Latin Americans and two Puerto Ricans fought for a world Heavyweight championship.\n\nOquendo later wanted to terminate his contract with Ramos, which caused for a verbal fight to break out between the two in different Puerto Rican media, including newspapers.\n\nRamos is still the on contract manager of Oquendo, and he returned with Félix Trinidad Jr. for his fights against Ricardo Mayorga and Ronald Wright.\n\nRamos purchased about $63,000,000 dollars in bonds for the Trinidads during Felix Jr.'s career. These were bought as an investment, but when Puerto Rico hit a financial crisis during the mid-2010s, their value dropped as Puerto Rican bonds ratings were reduced to junk status, causing the Trinidads to lose the money invested by Ramos.\n\n\n"}

The novel encompasses a broad range of topics, from aliens and redheads to consumerism, the building of bombs, romance, royalty, the Moon, and a pack of Camel cigarettes. The novel continuously addresses the question of \"how to make love stay\" and is sometimes referred to as \"a post-modern fairy tale\".\n\nPrincess Leigh-Cheri, a redheaded vegetarian liberal princess and former cheerleader, lives with her exiled royal parents Max and Tilli and their last loyal servant Gulietta in a converted farmhouse in Seattle. While attending a liberal CareFest in Hawaii with scientific and political speakers (including Leigh-Cheri's idol, Ralph Nader) Leigh-Cheri meets Bernard Mickey Wrangle, an outlaw bomber known as the Woodpecker. Like Leigh-Cheri, he is a redhead, and unlike her, he plans to blow up the CareFest.\n\nAt the Care Fest, Leigh-Cheri is approached by a beautiful blonde who claims she is from the planet Argon. She informs Leigh-Cheri that redheads are considered evil on her planet and that red hair is caused by \"sugar and lust.\" As it turns out, the Woodpecker has a passion for tequila that inadvertently causes him to bomb a UFO conference instead of his intended target. After the UFO conference is destroyed, a number of people see lights in the sky which seems to prove that the ambassadors from Argon were real.\n\nMeanwhile, Gulietta witnesses the Woodpecker's bombing and rats him out to Leigh-Cheri, who places him under citizen's arrest. Leigh-Cheri demands to know why Bernard wanted to destroy the CareFest, a cause dear to her heart. Bernard explains his outlaw philosophy, which is that freedom is more important than happiness. Leigh-Cheri is still skeptical, but begins to fall in love with Bernard. She takes him home to meet her parents, but after Bernard accidentally murders Queen Tilli's pet lapdog, he slips out in disgrace. Soon after, his outlaw past catches up with him, and he is taken back to prison.\n\nIn solidarity, Leigh-Cheri transforms her attic bedroom into a copy of Bernard's prison cell, leaving her alone with only a bed, a lamp, and a package of Camel cigarettes. While contemplating the Camels, Leigh-Cheri deciphers a secret message, which she believes is from a line of red-haired Argonians. The message reads CHOICE. Bernard learns of Leigh-Cheri's self-imposed exile, since it has drawn media coverage and led to many other people locking themselves away in attics for their lost loves. Bernard hears this news in prison, and sends Leigh-Cheri a scathing letter denouncing her practices.\n\nAfter a revolution in the homeland, Gulietta is crowned the queen (they had wanted Leigh-Cheri, but after the whole attic incident, thought her too flaky) and Leigh-Cheri leaves her attic exile and agrees to marry the handsome, wealthy Prince A'ben Fizel, on the condition that he will build her a pyramid as a wedding gift. A'ben Fizel suspects that Leigh-Cheri still loves Bernard and sets spies to follow her. While exploring the completed pyramid the night before the wedding, Leigh-Cheri discovered Bernard, alive, preparing to set up dynamite to destroy the pyramid. While the two reconcile, A'ben Fizel seals the pyramid, trapping the lovers inside, and announces to the world that the princess has been kidnapped.\n\nIn the meantime, Bernard and Leigh-Cheri, trapped in the pyramid, are living on wedding cake and champagne while they discuss the pyramids, redheads, the Moon, and the Argonian message on the box of Camel cigarettes. When they are almost completely out of supplies, Leigh-Cheri decides to use the dynamite to make an opening while Bernard sleeps, sacrificing her own life to save him.

The game can be played as a single player game or up to a four players cooperatively. Each character can do a special move related to their super power which reduces their health.\n\nDuring levels the game changes from a side-scrolling beat 'em up into a platform game as the camera zooms to a far-away view of the characters in miniature. Later it zooms back in for the much larger and more detailed characters to continue the brawling.\n\nThe game was divided into four acts, meeting various villains, including Kingpin, Venom and his symbiote clones, Doctor Octopus, Electro, Lizard, Scorpion, Sandman, Green Goblin, Hobgoblin, and finally Doctor Doom. High scores are separated by character; so a high score on Spider-Man may not be a high score on Hawkeye or Black Cat.\n\n\"Spider-Man: The Video Game\"'s soundtrack is also partially comprised from tunes from Sega's 1986 arcade game Quartet. Notably the tunes \"Oki Rap\" and \"FM Funk\" (For instance, \"FM Funk\" appears in the second stage in Spider-Man, while it is featured in the third stage of Quartet).\n\nThe game allows the user to play as one of four heroes: Spider-Man, Black Cat, Sub-Mariner, and Hawkeye. Unlike many games of this type which assigned a certain character to a certain joystick, any player can choose any character (as long as another player isn't already controlling them).\n\nEach hero has a unique set of moves and attacks/abilities, which could be used to beat up the bad guys, that suited their powers and characteristics, as well as basic attacks and jumps (assigned to each of the two buttons).\n\nSpider-Man is the game's main hero and protagonist of the game, as well as one of four playable characters. Spider-Man's move list and attacks consist primarily of moves which revolve around his web-based spider powers, such as swinging from webs and shooting webbing blasts.\n\nBlack Cat is one of the other three playable characters. Athletic and acrobatic like a cat, Black cat uses a combination of her claws, grappling hook and cables to defeat enemies throughout the game.\n\nRecognizable as one of the Avengers, Hawkeye is the third character in the game out of the four playable heroes. As evident by his weapon of choice, the bow and arrow, Hawkeye's attacks and abilities revolve around the use of his bow in order to defeat the enemies of the game.\n\nBeing a citizen of Atlantis, Sub-Mariner uses water based projectile attacks (such as a hydro-electric blast) in order to help him defeat enemies throughout the game.\n\n\"Spider-Man: The Video Game\" was showcased at the 1991 Las Vegas Amusement Expo.\n\nThe game was reviewed in 1992 in \"Dragon\" #177 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars.\n\nThe November 1991 issue of \"Sinclair User\" gave it the shared award for \"Games Most Likely To Save The Universe\" as one of the best superhero games, along with \"Captain America and The Avengers\" and \"Captain Commando\".\n\nThe January 1992 issue of \"Computer and Video Games\" gave it a positive review, praising the four-player gameplay, the \"incredible graphics\" with \"huge, beautifully animated sprites and an impressive zoom in/zoom out effect\" and the \"16 different stages\" with \"enough to keep you pumping in the credits.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2173021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173021", "title": "Lamport timestamp", "text": "Lamport timestamp\n\nThe Lamport timestamp algorithm is a simple logical clock algorithm used to determine the order of events in a distributed computer system. As different nodes or processes will typically not be perfectly synchronized, this algorithm is used to provide a partial ordering of events with minimal overhead, and conceptually provide a starting point for the more advanced vector clock method. They are named after their creator, Leslie Lamport.\n\nDistributed algorithms such as resource synchronization often depend on some method of ordering events to function. For example, consider a system with two processes and a disk. The processes send messages to each other, and also send messages to the disk requesting access. The disk grants access in the order the messages were \"received\". For example process formula_1 sends a message to the disk requesting write access, and then sends a read instruction message to process formula_2. Process formula_2 receives the message, and as a result sends its own read request message to the disk. If there is a timing delay causing the disk to receive both messages at the same time, it can determine which message \"happened-before\" the other: formula_1 \"happens-before\" formula_2 if one can get from formula_1 to formula_2 by a sequence of moves of two types: moving forward while remaining in the same process, and following a message from its sending to its reception. A logical clock algorithm provides a mechanism to determine facts about the order of such events.\n\nLamport invented a simple mechanism by which the \"happened-before\" ordering can be captured numerically. A Lamport logical clock is a numerical software counter value maintained in each process.\n\nConceptually, this logical clock can be thought of as a clock that only has meaning in relation to messages moving between processes. When a process receives a message, it re-synchronizes its logical clock with that sender. The above-mentioned vector clock is a generalization of the idea into the context of an arbitrary number of parallel, independent processes.\n\nThe algorithm follows some simple rules:\n\n\nIn pseudocode, the algorithm for sending is:\n\nThe algorithm for receiving a message is:\n\nFor every two different events formula_8 and formula_9 occurring in the same process, and formula_10 being the timestamp for a certain event formula_11, it is necessary that formula_12 never equals formula_13.\n\nTherefore it is necessary that:\n\n\nFor any two events, formula_8 and formula_9, if there’s any way that formula_8 could have influenced formula_9, then the Lamport timestamp of formula_8 will be less than the Lamport timestamp of formula_9. It’s also possible to have two events where we can’t say which came first; when that happens, it means that they couldn’t have affected each other. If formula_8 and formula_9 can’t have any effect on each other, then it doesn’t matter which one came first.\n\nA Lamport clock may be used to create a partial causal ordering of events between processes. Given a logical clock following these rules, the following relation is true: if formula_26 then formula_27, where formula_28 means \"happened-before\".\n\nThis relation only goes one way, and is called the \"clock consistency condition\": if one event comes before another, then that event's logical clock comes before the other's. The \"strong clock consistency condition\", which is two way (if formula_27 then formula_26), can be obtained by other techniques such as vector clocks. Using only a simple Lamport clock, only a partial causal ordering can be inferred from the clock.\n\nHowever, via the contrapositive, it's true that formula_31 implies formula_32. So, for example, if formula_33 then formula_8 cannot have \"happened-before\" formula_9.\n\nAnother way of putting this is that formula_27 means that formula_8 may have \"happened-before\" formula_9, or be incomparable with formula_9 in the \"happened-before\" ordering, but formula_8 did not happen after formula_9.\n\nNevertheless, Lamport timestamps can be used to create a total ordering of events in a distributed system by using some arbitrary mechanism to break ties (e.g., the ID of the process). The caveat is that this ordering is artifactual and cannot be depended on to imply a causal relationship.\n\nIn a distributed system, it is not possible in practice to synchronize time across entities (typically thought of as processes) within the system; hence, the entities can use the concept of a logical clock based on the events through which they communicate.\n\nIf two entities do not exchange any messages, then they probably do not need to share a common clock; events occurring on those entities are termed as concurrent events.\n\nAmong the processes on the same local machine we can order the events based on the local clock of the system.\n\nWhen two entities communicate by message passing, then the send event is said to \"happen-before\" the receive event, and the logical order can be established among the events.\n\nA distributed system is said to have partial order if we can have a partial order relationship among the events in the system. If 'totality', i.e., causal relationship among all events in the system, can be established, then the system is said to have total order.\n\nA single entity cannot have two events occur simultaneously. If the system has total order we can determine the order among all events in the system. If the system has partial order between processes, which is the type of order Lamport's logical clock provides, then we can only tell the ordering between entities that interact. Lamport addressed ordering two events with the same timestamp (or counter): \"To break ties, we use any arbitrary total ordering formula_42 of the processes.\" Thus two timestamps or counters may be the same within a distributed system, but in applying the logical clocks algorithm events that occur will always maintain at least a strict partial ordering.\n\nLamport clocks lead to a situation where all events in a distributed system are totally ordered. That is, if formula_26, then we can say formula_8 actually happened before formula_9.\n\nNote that with Lamport’s clocks, nothing can be said about the actual time of formula_8 and formula_9. If the logical clock says formula_26, that does not mean in reality that formula_8 actually happened before formula_9 in terms of real time.\n\nLamport clocks show non-causality, but do not capture all causality. Knowing formula_51 and formula_52 shows formula_53 did not cause formula_8 or formula_9 but we cannot say which initiated formula_53.\n\nThis kind of information can be important when trying to replay events in a distributed system (such as when trying to recover after a crash). If one node goes down, and we know the causal relationships between messages, then we can replay those messages and respect the causal relationship to get that node back up to the state it needs to be in.\n\n"}
{"id": "2173027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173027", "title": "Leptidea sinapis", "text": "Leptidea sinapis\n\n\"Leptidea sinapis,\" or the wood white butterfly of the family Pieridae, is a small white butterfly that is mainly found in England, Ireland, and Northern Europe. The butterfly has white wings with grey or yellow markings near the center or tip of the wing. It flies slowly and low over its shrubbery habitat. Males initiate courtship with females and can mate multiply, while females tend to only mate once in their lifetime.\n\nThe wood white was added to the UK BAP Priority Species list in 2005 due to a substantial decline in the population, especially in England. This decline has been attributed to changes in woodland regions, including increased shade due to tree planting, and the failure to maintain woodland rides in a satisfactory way for wood whites to oviposit. Conservation efforts are currently striving to understand how to best maintain woodland regions and are examining the effect of climate change (particularly during the winter months) on egg survival.\n\nThere are several subspecies of \"L. sinapis.\" These subspecies are all found in nearby regions, and thus geographical variation is slight. The following subspecies are recognized:\nThese subspecies, although they look similar, are different in the physiology of their genitals and are reproductively isolated from the wood white due to female conspecific mating choice.\n\nThe wood white is found in Europe and eastwards across the Caucasus, Asia Minor, the Middle East, Middle Asia, Kazakhstan and south Siberia to the Baikal region.\n\nWithin Europe, the wood white is unevenly distributed across the Midlands and Southern England, as well as Northern Europe and Ireland. Since the species is currently depleting in size throughout England, it is primarily found in woodland pockets, such as the Haugh and Wigmore Woods of Herefordshire. \"L. sinapis\" is also found in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Sweden, France, Spain and Ireland.\n\nThe wood white is found in the northern parts of the United Kingdom, largely in the clearings among woodlands or nearby shrubbery. They can often also be found in areas where there is substantial shelter, such as abandoned railway tracks and cliffs near the sea shore, as well as meadows, forest edges and sparse forests up to 2,500 m above sea level. One of the most consistently populous regions of northern England in terms of \"L. sinapis\" is in Herefordshire, particularly the Haugh Wood and Wigmore Rolls woodlands. The wood white requires habitats with substantial vegetation and shrubbery in order to lay eggs and pupate, however they are very particular about the amount of shade in their habitat. Substantial habitat loss for wood whites occurs as a result of too much shrubbery or shade in their living environments. They select very specific food-plants within these habitats.\n\nThe female wood white flies near woodland areas with substantial shrubbery, and lays its eggs on tall food-plants. There are several preferred plants on which \"L. sinapis\" have been observed to lay their larva. These include \"Lotus pedunculatus, Lathyrus pratensis,\" and \"Lotus corniculatus.\" Researchers hypothesize that the height of the plant may influence the number of larva laid there—the taller the plant, the more eggs expected. They tend to select these taller plants, and lay eggs on the underside of leaves in a single row.\n\nFemale wood whites lay the eggs on very specific food-plants (such as \"Lotus pedunculatus, Lathyrus pratensis,\" and \"Lotus corniculatus\") that they select through chemoreception via receptors on their feet. They fly low and slowly over the shrubbery and test several plants by landing on them and using their chemoreceptors.\n\nEggs hatch after 10–20 days, after which the larvae remain on the food plant and feed on its leaves.\n\nThe development of the larvae is temperature-dependent, with a range of 35–60 days spent developing. There are, on average, four larval instars, which all tend to stay on the food-plant during development, eating the leaves of the plant onto which they hatched. The larvae are green and well camouflaged on their food plant.\n\nWhen the larvae are ready to pupate, they wander for a variable amount of time (minimum 1 hour, maximum a few days) until they find a location to pupate. The resulting pale green or brown pupae are generally found on grass stems and on rose plants.\n\nAfter pupation, this species re-hatch into full grown wood white butterflies. The species is bivoltine, meaning that two generations hatch per year, during the months of late May through August.\n\n\"Leptidea sinapis\" is one of three species in a cryptic species complex. The other members of the cryptic species complex are \"L. reali\" and \"L. juvernica\". Similar species are \"L. morsei\", \"L. duponcheli\" and \"L. amurensis\". The two other related species that have been classified (\"L. reali\" and \"L. juvernica)\" do not exhibit cross-mating\".\" DNA and mitochondrial studies have shown that the two taxa are definitively different; although they appear the same in wing coloration and external appearance, they can be differentiated by their genitalia. A population genetic study of male \"L. sinapis, L. reali\" and \"L. juvernica\" individuals showed no evidence for gene flow after divergence. \"L. reali\" is found in Italy, Spain, and France, while \"L. juvernica\" is found more in England and Ireland, and other Nordic countries. They appear to be niche separated—they utilize and inhabit different habitats. Male members of the two species try and mate with females of both species with equal frequency, but the females only mate with members of their own species. Researchers are attempting to understand the reason for the niche-separation of the two subspecies. The two species tend to lay eggs on the same plants, causing researchers to hypothesize that host-plant selection is not the primary reason for niche-separation and later speciation. The choice of host plant did not affect survival rates of either species to any significant degree, but the most common host plant for both larvae was \"L. pratensis.\" A newly hypothesized explanation for this habitat separation, or existence of mosaic habitats is the long courtship rituals that these butterflies have. A female would not want to be subjected to the long courtship ritual only to bear the cost of having hybridized offspring, so there is niche separation to prevent heterospecific mating.\nThere is no local or regional migration of the wood white. The wood white is a bivoltine species, meaning that there are two generations of eggs that hatch in one year. The two generations of butterflies emerge and fly in May through June and secondly in July through August. Egg laying, hatching of the larvae, and pupation occur during the winter (over-wintering). Studies about how climate changes during the winter months affect pupation are being conducted to help develop conservation plans.\n\nThere are two reproductively isolated species of wood white called \"L. sinapis\" and \"L. reali.\" These two species can mate with each other (heterospecific mating), but it is in their best interest, for the viability and fecundity of their offspring, that they mate only within their species (conspecific mating). Male members of the two species try and court or mate with females of both species with equal frequency, but the females only mate with members of their own species. This female choice has caused the two species to diverge and become reproductively isolated. There is a time and energy cost that the females bear when males of the opposite species attempt to mate with them—this cost has led to females occasionally acquiescing and mating with these males, leading to some degree of between-species hybridization.\n\nThere is an elaborate courtship ritual between wood whites, initiated by the male. They begin by wagging their head from one side to another, extending their proboscis towards the female. The female, with her antennae pulled back, would be unmoving if already mated and would immediately move their abdomen towards the male if not.\nFemales mate only once in nature, while males can mate several times. This can be explained by the competing pressures that each sex faces. wood white males would need to mate with as many conspecific females as possible to maximize the number of viable offspring, while females benefit from only mating once, since the egg-laying process of choosing the best food-plant on which to oviposit is so time and energy intensive—mating multiple times would not be a good use of resources.\n\nAdult wood whites fly slowly, and they appear to flutter. Males spend the majority of their lifetime flying low over shrubbery to find possible mates.\n\nWood white butterflies have white wings, sometimes with small grey or yellowish markings towards the middle or edge of the wing. Males have white-tipped antennae, while females have brown-tipped antennae. They have a 36-44mm wingspan.\n\nIt had been long held that butterfly species feeding on nectar had served as pollinator vectors, but the \"L. sinapis\" demonstrates that this is not always the case. An analysis of the relationship between the \"Phlox-Coliasis\" pollination system and the \"L.\" sinapis which feeds on the nectar, displays that the pollination efficiency is around 1%, extremely low for the need to successfully pollinate the host population. Thus, rather than being considered a mutualistic relationship, the \"L.\" sinapis is considered a parasite to the flowers from which they feed.\n\nPredators of the wood white eggs are largely unknown, but lead to 90-98% of all egg deaths.\n\nThe chalcid fly parasitizes the wood white eggs and accounts for only a small percentage of egg death. The larvae are parasitized by \"Cotesia vitripennis\" and \"C. anchisiades,\" which are two wasp species.\n\nRapid changes in shade (tree-cover, buildings, etc.) in the woodlands where the butterflies lay their eggs and moist or colder weather during ovipositing season contribute to the lower quantities of adult wood whites during the months of June through August.\n\nThe wood white butterfly was named a UK BAP Priority Species candidate in 2005, due to the substantial drop in population size in the last quarter century. There are several habitat-related reasons behind the drop in wood white butterfly. Researchers hypothesize that this could be due to the changing treatment of woodland areas, including over-planting of trees. Many of the woodlands where wood whites colonize were replanted in the last 50 years, leading to a large increase in the amount of shade over the woodland rides and shrubbery. Very little is understood about how to upkeep woodland areas so that they are sufficient for wood white colonization; this is the main area of research on conversation presently.\n\nThere have been efforts to recolonize areas of the United Kingdom as part of a 10-year plan to reintroduce more wood whites into the area. This recolonization involves maintaining woodland ride areas to minimize loss of vegetation and dispersing the butterflies strategically into woodland ride areas in Britain. Another major point of interest for the conservation effort is to examine how weather and climate change, particularly in the winter, affects pupation, since this process largely takes place over winter (called overwintering of the pupae).\n\n\n"}

During that time, no successor was willing nor assigned to officially take her vacated placement.\n\nAfter her shortened reign, Muñoz became a popular actress and starred in several comedies, including \"Mama Turns 100\", and in the dramas \"Clara es el Precio\", \"The Other Bedroom\" and \"Dedicatory\". Her personal life was often shrouded in notorious events and controversies. She died on 27 February 2011 due to cerebral aneurysm complications and was buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery of Saint Michael in Malaga city.\n\nAmparo Munoz was born in 21 June 1954 to a blacksmith father and a housewife. She was the firstborn child among six children. Her godparents helped raise her at age seven due to their family’s poverty. \n\nAfter finishing high school, she worked as an administrative office assistant for “The Southern” local newspaper in Malaga. The gay male director of the newspaper agency strongly encouraged Munoz to enter the beauty contest,\" “El Certamen de Belleza de Costa del Sol” \" (English: Miss Sun Coast Beauty Contest) which gained her an entry sash to participate and won in the 1973 Miss Spain contest in Lanzarote city.\n\nAmparo Muñoz came from the town of Vélez-Málaga (Málaga) in Andalusia, where she had won the city title, to compete at the Miss Spain contest held in Lanzarote. After winning, she went on to win the Miss Universe 1974 pageant in Manila, Philippines. According to her translator, she was homesick; six months after winning, she gave up her crown after she reportedly refused travel to Japan. However, the Miss Universe Organization decided that Muńoz will still remain as the official titleholder of Miss Universe 1974 since the title was not offered to 1st runner-up Miss Wales Helen Elizabeth Morgan who eventually won Miss World 1974 later that year only to be dethroned a few days after winning the crown.\n\nAfter her victory in the world of beauty, the world of cinema took interest in her. Her first steps in the world of film came in 1973 with in \"Wholesome Married Life\", directed by Roberto Bodegas and written by José Luis Garci, she played the temptress of José Sacristán, a married man obsessed with publicity. In \"Tocata y fuga de Lolita\" she was the rebellious girl who displayed her beautiful bust, a big contributor to the movie’s popularity. In the 70’s, Spanish cinema was at the height of destape [double meaning: “liberalization” and “nudity”], and the splendid figure of Amparo Muñoz found 9 titles in which to reveal itself, including \"Clara es el Precio\" (Vicente Aranda, 1975), and \"The Other Bedroom\" (Eloy de la Iglesia, 1976), in which Amparo starred alongside the man who would be her first husband, the actor and singer Patxi Andión.\n\nAfter appearances in Volvoreta (José Antonio Nieves Conde, 1976), \"Del amor y de la muerte\" (Antonio Giménez Rico, 1977), among other films, her cinematic career took a notable turn when she began a relationship with the producer Elías Querejeta, facilitating her appearances in films as important as \"Dedicatory\" (Jaime Chávarri, 1980), which called her to the attention of other directors in both Spain and Mexico, such as Felipe Cazals (\"Las siete cucas \"), Pilar Miró (\"We Will Speak Tonight\"), Jaime Camino (\"The Open Balcony\"), Emilio Martínez Lázaro (\"Lulú of the Night\"), Imanol Uribe (\"The Black Moon\"). She became an instant celebrity in Spain, alongside the likes of Nino Bravo, Pedro Carrasco, Rocío Dúrcal, Rocío Jurado, Camilo Sesto, La Pandilla and other Spanish celebrities of the 1970s, following her victory at Miss Universe with a fruitful show business career.\n\nIn 1979, Muñoz acted in the comedy \"Mama Turns 100\", by Carlos Saura. This was followed by performances in 1982's \"Todo un Hombre\" (\"He's all a Man\"), 1999's \"A Paradise Under the Stars\" and 2003's \"El Tahur\". In the late-1990s, she returned to mainstream Spanish cinema with the movie \"Familia\", by Fernando León de Aranoa and started a new life as an actress.\n\nIn 1980, she went to live in Mexico and partnered with Chilean national Flavio Labarca, who ran an antique shop. In 1991, she lived with Victor Guijarro in the Philippines, thereby disappearing from film for seven years (1989-1996), but eventually her immediate family requested her return to Spain, during which began the alleged melancholia and extreme mental depression of Muñoz. Returning to Spain, growing tabloid newspaper accusations of mental depression, drug addiction, Parkinson’s Disease, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus coupled with poverty and melancholia ravaged Muñoz’ public image, along with the physical decrepitude allegedly causing emotional shame and her imminent withdrawal from society.\n\nIn 1976, Muñoz met singer-songwriter Patxi Andión, who would become her first husband, while making \"The Other Bedroom\". They were married in 16 May 1976 and divorced in 1978, however due to the irregularities of this marriage according to Constitution of Spain, it was not legally finalized until 1983.\n\nAfterwards, Muñoz had brief relationships with Antonio Flores, Vicente Fernández and Máximo Valverde. She also dated both Flavio Labarca when she lived in Mexico in 1980 and Víctor Rubio Guijarro in the Philippines in 1991, both who suffered from drug abuse by which Munoz called off in both relationships. \n\nThe most significant extramarital relationship of Muñoz's life was with Elías Querejeta. She met Querejeta on the set of \"Mamá cumple cien años\", which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 52nd Academy Awards. The relationship subsequently received much publicity. Querejeta remained married to his wife throughout their relationship—although he and his wife had been living separate lives, there was never an official split and neither party pursued a divorce. Accordingly, Muñoz as a mistress, did not interfere to break this union, and also never fought for possible marriage or conjugal rights.\n\nMuñoz had been long struggling with health issues. In the spring of 1991, she suffered from acute pancreatitis. In 2003, she was formally diagnosed with a brain tumor along with an arterial malformation in the vicinity of her Cerebellum. \n\nMunoz was advised by her physicians of imminent death in which she suffered two cerebral aneurysms, the first case which paralyzed half of her body. She died on 27 February 2011, at the age of 56. Her gravestone is marked at the Roman Catholic cemetery of Saint Michael in Malaga, Spain.\n"}

He was decorated for his services at the battles of Albuera (fought on May 16, 1811, and at which Beresford, operating independently from Wellington, commanded the allied forces), Salamanca (July 22, 1812), Orthez (February 27, 1814), and Toulouse (April 5, 1814).\n\nAfter the revolution of 1820, in the civil war between Constitutionalists Liberals (the new parliamentary constitution was supported by King João VI) and Absolutists (supporting his younger son, the \"Infante\" – that is, royal prince – Miguel of Portugal, a sworn enemy of any form of democracy), Travassos Valdez was strongly on the Constitutionalist side and was engaged in suppressing Absolutist revolts.\n\nWhen Miguel became titular commander-in-chief of the army, he had Travassos Valdez removed from his post and sent into exile in Setúbal, where the 'Parc Bonfim' now commemorates his time there; but after the prince overreached himself in April 1825, with an attempted coup (known as the \"Abrilada\") and was sent into exile, Travassos Valdez was reinstated. After the death of King João VI, a Spanish army invaded Portugal to restore Absolutist rule; Travassos Valdez, with just 900 men, opposed 6,000 Spaniards at Bragança, delaying their advance until the government was able to raise sufficient forces to oppose them. However, the Spaniards captured Travassos Valdez and sent him to Spain; but he escaped and returned to Portugal. He then declined the governorship of Portuguese Angola, offered him by the regent, Dona Isabel Maria, and was instead made Captain General (governor) of Madeira and Porto Santo in 1827.\n\nWhen Dom Miguel returned and seized power from the rightful heir, his niece Maria II, and proclaimed himself 'Absolute King', Travassos Valdez held out in Madeira until his defence of the island was overwhelmed by an expeditionary force despatched from Portugal. As Miguel had given orders that Travassos Valdez should be hanged if captured, he was forced to flee the Portuguese realms and, with his wife, brother, and six children, sailed to England under the protection of the British Royal Navy in September 1828. He joined the many refugees from Dom Miguel's tyranny and in 1832 made his way to the Azores to join the expedition of Dom Pedro I of Brazil, father of Maria II and formerly Emperor of Brazil, to restore Maria to her throne and constitutional rule to Portugal.\n\nPedro's expeditionary force landed in Portugal in 1832 and was besieged for a year in the city of Porto. After the Battle of Ponte Ferreira, when Dom Pedro instituted changes in his high command, Travassos Valdez exercised the functions of Adjutant-General and chief of the General Staff of the Army of Liberation. During the major Miguelite assault on the city on September 29, 1832, Travassos Valdez was severely wounded defending the redoubt at the Bonfim church; from this, he later took his title of nobility. A year later, on September 5, 1833, he was again wounded at the siege of Lisbon, which the Constitutionalists had wrested from Dom Miguel. Dom Miguel was at last defeated in 1834 and sent into exile, this time permanently.\n\nDom Pedro died immediately after his victory and a long period of political unrest between competing factions began under the young queen Maria II. Governments came and went, mostly lasting only a few months. On September 17, 1835 Travassos Valdez was elevated to the peerage as Baron Bonfim. From October 1836 he commanded forces in the Alentejo against the Spanish Carlist general, Miguel Gómez Damas, who was threatening the frontier. In 1837 he was elected deputy for the constituents of the district of Leiria to the parliament.\n\nWhen the Chartist forces raised an insurrection against the government on July 12, 1837, and the Dukes of Saldanha and Terceira put themselves at its head, according to an early 20th-century account:\n\n\"The Lisbon government confided extraordinary powers to the Viscount de Sá and the baron de Bonfim. These two officers, with the constitutional forces, attacked the marshals' troops at Rio Maior on the 28th of August, and, although on both sides they had more than six weeks in which to make preparations, neither of the armies counted 800 men. But the soldiers were more prudent than their leaders. After a slight infantry skirmish in which the Portuguese had sensible losses to deplore, the marshals gave the order to charge to their little squadron and the Viscount de Sá advanced at the head of his troop. The cavalry on both sides stopped at 50 paces, replaced their sabres in their scabbards, and having fraternised returned faithfully to the flags of their respective commanders. The latter saw themselves compelled to sign an armistice and the marshals retired to the North.\"\n\nOn September 9, 1837 Bonfim was appointed Minister of War and interim Foreign Minister and Minister of Marine in the second government of Sá de Bandeira. Among his acts in this office, following the crushing of the Chartist rebellion at the Battle of Ruivães on September 20, 1837, was disarming the National Guard, which had been converted into a permanent force for insurrection. On March 13, 1838 he used troops to put down a revolt by rebels who had occupied the Lisbon Arsenal, a decisive act that probably prevented the fall of the liberal government. By a Decree of D. Maria II of April 4, 1838 he was elevated to the Nobility, as Count of Bonfim. (The family tended to use the older spelling 'Bomfim'.) He was a senator in the legislature of 1839–40.and deputy for the constituents of the district of Leiria. On September 26, 1839 he assumed the leadership of the government as Prime Minister, and provided the first period of relative stability by presiding over the eleventh government, a coalition which succeeded in remaining in office for nearly two years, until 1841. He retained the office of Foreign Minister until December 28, 1839. Bonfim’s administration, in which he combined the posts of Prime Minister, Minister of War, and head of the Colonial Department, lasted to June 9, 1841. Among those taking office in his ministry were Costa Cabral, Rodrigo da Fonseca Magalhães and others. It was during the period of his government that various European powers (among them, the Holy See) resumed diplomatic relations with Portugal, having broken them off after the arrival of the constitutional regime. He especially cultivated friendly relations with Spain after the tensions of the Carlist War. He was responsible for the foundation in July 1840 of the fortress and town of Mossâmedes in southern Angola and he promoted internal pacification in Portugal. On December 26, 1840, Portugal and the United States of America signed a Mutual Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. Bonfim resigned the premiership when he encountered resistance to his plans to reform the National Guard, and was succeeded in office by Joaquim António de Aguiar, who had been his deputy.\n\nAfter the \"coup d'état\" of 1842, which brought the Costa Cabral government to power, the Count of Bonfim became its most implacable opponent. In 1844 he raised the standard of rebellion against Costa Cabral's dictatorial policies but his associates were imprisoned or forced to flee the country and he himself left Portugal until the rebellion of Maria da Fonte in 1846. When the anti-Cabralist government of the Duke of Palmela took office Bonfim returned to Portugal, but in October the palace coup known as the Emboscada brought a new government of Cabralist sympathies to power, headed by the Duke of Saldanha. In the ensuing 'Little Civil War' or Patuleia, Travassos Valdez supported the revolutionary Junta of Porto against the more conservative forces around the Queen and took command of the 'Progressista' army. Expected reinforcement from the troops commanded by the Conde of Antas, the President of the Junta, was not forthcoming in time, and Bonfim and his army were besieged by Saldanha in the fortress of Torres Vedras and defeated, December 22–23, 1846. In violation of their safe-conduct, Bonfim, his two eldest sons and various political associates were exiled to Moçâmedes in southern Angola. He escaped from there with his sons in a skiff, intending to sail to Saint Helena, but was recaptured; the safe return of the exiles by the British Royal Navy and their honourable reinstatement was a condition of the Peace negotiated by the Four Powers at the Convention of Gramido, 1847. Bonfim and his associates were repatriated to Portugal in the British frigate HMS \"Terrible\", returning to Lisbon on October 9, and his rank and honours were restored. After 1851 he was appointed head of the Supreme Council of Military Justice, and on his death in Lisbon in 1862 was accorded a state funeral.\n\nHe had married (February 21, 1813) D. Jerónima Emília Godinho Valdez, daughter of José Ricardo Godinho Valdez, 14th lord Quinta de Flandres, Pombal, and administrator of N. Sr.ª das Neves and Marco, and his wife D. Maria Joana Travassos da Silveira. (Travassos Valdez's wife was his first cousin twice over, being the daughter of his father's sister and his mother's brother.) Among the most notable of his children, the eldest son José Bento Travassos Valdez (1814–1881) was Colonial Secretary of Angola in 1841–45, shared his father's exile in 1846–47 and became 2nd Count of Bonfim; the second son Luís Travassos Valdez (1816–1900) attained the rank of General and was a distinguished writer on military affairs; the third son António Travassos Valdez (1818–1855) entered the diplomatic service, edited the first annual report of the conduct of affairs published by the Foreign Ministry and died as Portuguese ambassador to Denmark; and the fourth son was the noted travel writer and anti-slavery campaigner Francisco Travassos Valdez (1825–1892). A sixth son, Pedro de Alcântara Travassos Valdez (1827–1887), settled in the English village of Dalwood in Devon and is buried in the graveyard of St Peter's Church there, with an elaborate headstone summarizing his father's career.\n\n"}

The common clouded yellow's breeding range is North Africa and southern Europe and eastwards through Turkey into the Middle East but it occurs throughout much of Europe as a summer migrant, in good years individuals reaching Scandinavia. In Asia, its range extends into central Siberia in the north and barely into India in the south; it is not found in Central Asia.\n\nThis species is primarily an immigrant to the UK, originating from southern Europe and northern Africa. In the UK they can be seen on the south coast almost every year in varying numbers, and regularly breed there. Occurrence in the rest of the UK varies considerably from year to year, but they are increasingly observed as far north as Dumfries and Galloway. It has also been recorded in Ireland from the Raven, Co. Wexford, to Belfast, Co. Down.\n\nA truly migratory European butterfly, this species is famous for occasional mass migrations and subsequent breeding, which are often referred to in the United Kingdom as \"clouded yellow years\". Notable clouded yellow years include 1877, 1947, 1983, 1992, 1994, 1996 and 2000.\n\nThese butterflies may live in any open area in the countryside, including downland, coastal cliffs and fields containing the caterpillar's host plants, at an elevation up to above sea level.\n\n\"Colias croceus\" has a wingspan of . The upperside of the wings is golden to orange yellow with a broad black margin on all four wings and a black spot near the centre forewing. Usually these butterflies settles with its wings closed, consequently the black margin of the uppersides of the wings is difficultly visible.\n\nThe underside lacks the black borders and is lighter, with a more greenish tint, particularly on the forewings. In the forewing underside is the same dark spot as on the upperside, but often with a light centre; the hindwing underside has a white centre spot, often with a smaller white or dark dot immediately above it. Sometimes, a row of black dots occurs on the underwings' outer margins, corresponding to where the black border ends on the upperside. Females differ from the males in having yellow spots along the black borders on the upperside.\n\nIn flight, \"Colias croceus\" is easily identifiable by the intense yellow colouring, much brighter than that of the lemon-yellow male common brimstone which also lacks black markings. Like all \"Colias\" species they never open their wings at rest.\n\nIn a small proportion of females (about 5%) the golden upperside colouration is replaced by a pale cream colour. These females have been distinguished as form \"helice\". The pale form \"helice\" does not seem to be that distinct as intermediates exist and the variation is to some extent related to humidity during development, with dryer conditions producing paler colouration. These pale forms \"helice\" can be confused with Berger's clouded yellow (\"Colias alfacariensis\") and the rarer Pale clouded yellow (\"Colias hyale\"). Even the palest \"C. croceus\" tends to have more black on the upperside however, in particular on the hindwings.\n\nYoung caterpillars are yellow-green, with a black head. Later they become completely dark green, with a white red spotted lateral line after the third moult. The pupae are green and have a yellow side stripe.\n\nThis species is rather similar to \"Colias myrmidone\", \"Colias chrysotheme\", \"Colias erate\", \"Colias hyale\", \"Colias alfacariensis\", \"Colias caucasica\", \"Colias aurorina\".\n\nAdults fly from March to October. In southern Europe and North Africa they breed continuously throughout the year. Eggs are laid singly on food plant leaves. Usually an extraordinary number of eggs – up to 600 – are laid from a single female.\n\nThe caterpillars grow fast in warm weather, sometimes pupating within a month. Caterpillars have 4 moults in total. The pupa remains attached to a foodplant stem by a silk girdle. Pupation lasts for two or three weeks and in good years there can be as many as three generations per year, with adults still on the wing at the beginning of November.\n\nLarvae feed on a variety of leguminous plants, namely Faboideae (\"Trifolium pratense\", \"Medicago sativa\", \"Medicago lappacea\", \"Medicago hispida\", \"Medicago polymorpha\", \"Medicago sulcata\", \"Vicia\", \"Lotus\", \"Onobrychis\", \"Astragalus\", \"Colutea arborescens\", \"Hippocrepis\", and \"Anthyllis\" species). In the UK wild and cultivated clovers (\"Trifolium\") and alfalfa (\"Medicago sativa\") are favourites; less frequently, common bird's-foot trefoil \"Lotus corniculatus\" is eaten.\n\nAdults feed primarily on nectar of thistles (\"Cirsium\" spp. and \"Carduus\" spp.), knapweeds (\"Centaurea\" spp.), dandelion (\"Taraxacum\"), fleabane (\"Pulicaria dysenterica\"), marjoram (\"Origanum vulgare\"), ragwort (\"Senecio jacobaea\"), and vetches (\"Vicia\" spp.).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2173054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173054", "title": "Book of Dzyan", "text": "Book of Dzyan\n\nThe Book of Dzyan (comprising the Stanzas of Dzyan) is a reputedly ancient text of Tibetan origin. The \"Stanzas\" formed the basis for \"The Secret Doctrine\" (1888), one of the foundational works of the theosophical movement, by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky.\n\nMadame Blavatsky claimed to have seen a manuscript of the \"Book of Dzyan\" while studying esoteric lore in Tibet. She claimed this and other ancient manuscripts were safeguarded from profane eyes by the initiates of an Occult Brotherhood. The work had originally, according to Blavatsky, been written in the sacred language of Senzar. She wrote \n\nOthers have been skeptical. Max Müller is reported to have said that ‘in this matter she was either a remarkable forger or that she has made the most valuable gift to archeological research in the Orient.’\n\nIn other references Blavatsky claimed the \"Book of Dzyan\" belonged to a group of Tibetan esoteric writings known as the \"Books of Kiu-Te\". Blavatsky wrote before a standard transcription of Tibetan into the Latin alphabet had been agreed upon; it took David Reigle some time to establish that she was referring to what modern scholars write as \"rGyud-sde (gyü de, section of tantras)\" parts of a voluminous Buddhist corpus commonly referred to as the Tantras. \n\nOther researchers have suggested a source in Chinese Taoism or Jewish kabbala.\n\nIn Isis Unveiled Blavatsky herself identifies Senzar as being \"ancient Sanskrit\" (Isis, I, 440). As noted by John Algeo in his book, Blavatsky's other statements about Senzar (including the above linkage to Sanskrit) create a number of puzzles, which make it difficult to take the etymological language family references literally, since some link to Egyptian sources, while yet others are still of other roots. \n\nSupposed verses from the same \"Stanzas of Dzyan\" were later published by Alice Bailey in \"A Treatise on Cosmic Fire\" in 1925. Bailey claimed these verses had been dictated to her telepathically by the Tibetan Master Djwal Kul.\n\nUfologist Desmond Leslie drew heavily on the \"Stanzas of Dzyan\" in his writing, and theorized that they had originally been produced on the lost continent of Atlantis.\n\nSwiss author Erich von Däniken claimed to have explored some of the book's content and its alleged history, reporting unsourced rumours that the first version of the book predates Earth, and that chosen people who simply touch the book will receive visions of what it describes.\n\nReferences to the \"Stanzas\" exist in the fiction of H. P. Lovecraft, for example in his short story \"The Haunter of the Dark\", and have been expanded upon by other writers who have worked within the Cthulhu Mythos.\n\nWhen \"The Secret Doctrine\" appeared, William Emmette Coleman was “outraged by Madame Blavatksy’s pretensions of Oriental learning, [and] undertook a complete exegesis of her works.\" He claimed that her main sources were H.H. Wilson's translations of the Vishnu Purana; Alexander Winchell’s \"World Life: or, Contemporary Geology\"; Ignatius Donnely’s \"\" (1882); and other contemporary scientific and occult works, plagiarized without credit and, in his own opinion, used in a blundering manner that showed superficial acquaintance with the subjects under discussion. He further claimed that she took at least part of her \"Stanzas of Dzyan\" from the Hymn of Creation in the old Sanskrit Rig-Veda. Coleman promised a book that would expose all of H.P.B.’s sources including that of the word \"Dzyan\".\n\nHistorian Ronald H. Fritze notes that:[Blavatsky] claimed to have received her information during trances in which the Masters of Mahatmas of Tibet communicated with her and allowed her to read from the ancient Book of Dzyan. The Book of Dzyan was supposedly composed in Atlantis using the lost language of Senzar but the difficulty is that no scholar of ancient languages in the 1880s or since has encountered the slightest passing reference to the Book of Dzyan or the Senzar language.In her biography \"HPB: The Extraordinary Life and Influence of Helena Blavatsky\", Sylvia Cranston tackles the claim of plagiarism that was leveled by William Emmette Coleman. Her view, like Coleman's, is that HPB's plagiarism consisted of quoting primary sources, without acknowledging the secondary sources from which they came.\n\nCranston states that a research assistant of hers took on the task of finding Coleman's alleged 70 passages that HPB plagiarized from \"World-Life\", and could only find 6. Coleman himself, far from being an authority on occult material, was a clerk in the Quartermaster Department of the US Army. He was likely not an impartial judge, having written to Coues on July 8, 1890, \"I emphatically denounced and ridiculed the theory of occultism, of elementary spirits, etc., before the Theosophical Society was organized [in 1875], and from that time to this I have strenuously opposed Theosophy all the time.\" Coleman promised to publish a book that would \"prove\" his charges against Blavatsky regarding the \"Book of Dzyan\"; this book and its proof never appeared. The reason Coleman's book never appeared is that “Coleman lost his library and his notes in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and died three years later, his book unwritten”.\n\n\n\n"}

Despite the differences in size and coloration, they are sometimes mistaken for American red squirrels or eastern gray squirrels in areas where the species co-exist.\n\nThe squirrel's total body length measures , tail length is , and they range in weight from . There is no sexual dimorphism in size or appearance. Individuals tend to be smaller in the west. There are three distinct geographical phases in coloration: In most areas the animals upper body is brown-grey to brown-yellow with a typically brownish-orange underside, while in eastern regions such as the Appalachians there are more strikingly-patterned dark brown and black squirrels with white bands on the face and tail. In the south can be found isolated communities with uniform black coats. To help with climbing, they have sharp claws, developed extensors of digits and flexors of forearms, and abdominal musculature. Fox squirrels have excellent vision and well-developed senses of hearing and smell. They use scent marking to communicate with other fox squirrels. \"Fox squirrels also have several sets of vibrissae, hairs or whiskers that are used as touch receptors to sense the environment. These are found above and below their eyes, on their chin and nose, and on each forearm.\" The dental formula of \"S. niger\" is \n\nThe fox squirrel's natural range extends through most of the eastern United States, north into the southern prairie provinces of Canada, and west to the Dakotas, Colorado, and Texas. They are absent (except for vagrants) in New England, New Jersey, most of New York, northern and eastern Pennsylvania, Ontario, Quebec, and the Atlantic provinces of Canada. They have been introduced to both northern and southern California, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Washington, and New Mexico. While very versatile in their habitat choices, fox squirrels are most often found in forest patches of 40 hectares or less with an open understory, or in urban neighborhoods with trees. They thrive best among oak, hickory, walnut, pecan and pine trees, storing their nuts for winter. Western range extensions in Great Plains regions such as Kansas are associated with riverine corridors of cottonwood. A subspecies native to several eastern US states is the Delmarva fox squirrel (\"S. n. cinereus\").\n\nFox squirrels are most abundant in open forest stands with little understory vegetation; they are not found in stands with dense undergrowth. Ideal habitat is small stands of large trees interspersed with agricultural land. The size and spacing of pines and oaks are among the important features of fox squirrel habitat. The actual species of pines and oaks themselves may not always be a major consideration in defining fox squirrel habitat. Fox squirrels are often observed foraging on the ground several hundred meters from the nearest woodlot. Fox squirrels also commonly occupy forest edge habitat.\n\nFox squirrels have two types of shelters: leaf nests (dreys) and tree dens. They may have two tree cavity homes or a tree cavity and a leaf nest. Tree dens are preferred over leaf nests during the winter and for raising young. When den trees are scarce, leaf nests are used year-round. Leaf nests are built during the summer months in forks of deciduous trees about 30 feet (9 m) above the ground. Fox squirrels use natural cavities and crotches (forked branches of a tree) as tree dens. Den trees in Ohio had an average diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) of and were an average of from the nearest woodland border. About 88% of den trees in eastern Texas had an average d.b.h. of or more. Dens are usually wide and inches deep. Den openings are generally circular and about . Fox squirrels may make their own den in a hollow tree by cutting through the interior; however, they generally use natural cavities or cavities created by northern flickers (\"Colaptes auratus\") or red-headed woodpeckers (\"Melanerpes erythrocephalus\"). Crow nests have also been used by fox squirrels.\n\nFox squirrels use leaf nests or tree cavities for shelter and litter rearing. Forest stands dominated by mature to over mature trees provide cavities and a sufficient number of sites for leaf nests to meet the cover requirements. Overstory trees with an average d.b.h. of or more generally provide adequate cover and reproductive habitat. Optimum tree canopy closure for fox squirrels is from 20% to 60%. Optimum conditions of understory closure occur when the shrub-crown closure is 30% or less.\n\nFox squirrels are tolerant of human proximity, and even thrive in crowded urban and suburban environments. They exploit human habitations for sources of food and nesting sites, being as happy nesting in an attic as they are in a hollow tree.\n\nFood habits of fox squirrels depend largely on geographic location. In general, fox squirrel foods include mast, tree buds, insects, tubers, bulbs, roots, bird eggs, seeds of pines and spring-fruiting trees, and fungi. Agricultural crops such as corn, soybeans, oats, wheat, and fruit are also eaten. Mast eaten by fox squirrels commonly includes turkey oak (\"Quercus laevis\"), southern red oak (\"Quercus falcata\"), blackjack oak (\"Quercus marilandica\"), bluejack oak (\"Quercus incana\"), post oak (\"Quercus stellata\"), and live oak (\"Quercus virginiana\").\n\nIn Illinois, fox squirrels rely heavily on hickories from late August through September. Pecans, black walnuts (\"Juglans nigra\"), osage orange (\"Maclura pomifera\") fruits, and corn are also important fall foods. In early spring, elm buds and seeds are the most important food. In May and June, mulberries (\"Morus\" spp.) are heavily used. By early summer, corn in the milk stage becomes a primary food.\n\nDuring the winter in Kansas, osage orange is a staple item supplemented with seeds of the Kentucky coffee tree (\"Gymnocladus dioicus\") and honey locust (\"Gleditsia triacanthos\"), corn, wheat, eastern cottonwood (\"Populus deltoides\" var. \"deltoides\") bark, ash seeds, and eastern red cedar (\"Juniperus virginiana\") berries. In the spring, fox squirrels feed primarily on buds of elm, maple, and oaks but also on newly sprouting leaves and insect larvae.\n\nFox squirrels in Ohio prefer hickory nuts, acorns, corn, and black walnuts. The squirrels are absent where two or more of these mast trees are missing. Fox squirrels also eat buckeyes, seeds and buds of maple and elm, hazelnuts (\"Corylus\" spp.), blackberries (\"Rubus\" spp.), and tree bark. In March, they feed mainly on buds and seeds of elm, maple, and willow. In Ohio, eastern fox squirrels have the following order of food preference: white oak (\"Quercus alba\") acorns, black oak (\"Quercus velutina\") acorns, red oak (\"Quercus rubra\") acorns, walnuts, and corn.\n\nIn eastern Texas, fox squirrels prefer the acorns of bluejack oak, pecans, southern red oak (\"Q. falcata\"), and overcup oak (\"Q. lyrata\"). The least preferred foods are acorns of swamp chestnut oak (\"Q. michauxii\") and overcup oak. In California, fox squirrels feed on English walnuts (\"J. regia\"), oranges, avocados, strawberries, and tomatoes. In midwinter, they feed on eucalyptus seeds.\n\nIn Michigan, fox squirrels feed on a variety of foods throughout the year. Spring foods are mainly tree buds and flowers, insects, bird eggs, and seeds of red maple (\"Acer rubrum\"), silver maple (\"Acer saccharinum\"), and elms. Summer foods include a variety of berries, plum and cherry pits, fruits of basswood (\"Tilia americana\"), fruits of box elder (\"Acer negundo\"), black oak acorns, hickory nuts, seeds of sugar (\"Acer saccharum\") and black maple (\"Acer nigrum\"), grains, insects, and unripe corn. Fall foods consist mainly of acorns, hickory nuts, beechnuts, walnuts, butternuts (\"Juglans cinerea\"), and hazelnuts. Caches of acorns and hickory nuts are heavily used in winter.\n\nFox squirrels are strictly diurnal, non-territorial, and spend more of their time on the ground than most other tree squirrels. They are still, however, agile climbers. They construct two types of homes called \"dreys\", depending on the season. Summer dreys are often little more than platforms of sticks high in the branches of trees, while winter dens are usually hollowed out of tree trunks by a succession of occupants over as many as 30 years. Cohabitation of these dens is not uncommon, particularly among breeding pairs.\n\nFox squirrels will form caches by burying food items for later consumption. They like to store foods that are shelled and high in fat, such as acorns and nuts. Shelled foods are favored because they are less likely to spoil than non-shelled foods, and fatty foods are valued for their high energy density.\n\nThey are not particularly gregarious or playful, in fact they have been described as solitary and asocial creatures, coming together only in breeding season. They have a large vocabulary, consisting most notably of an assortment of clucking and chucking sounds, not unlike some \"game\" birds, and they warn of approaching threats with distress screams. In the spring and fall, groups of fox squirrels clucking and chucking together can make a small ruckus. They also make high-pitched whines during mating. When threatening another fox squirrel, they will stand upright with their tail over their back and flick it.\n\nThey are impressive jumpers, easily spanning fifteen feet in horizontal leaps and free-falling twenty feet or more to a soft landing on a limb or trunk.\n\nFemale fox squirrels come into estrus in mid-December or early January, then again in June. They normally produce two litters a year; however, yearling females may only produce one. Females become sexually mature at 10 to 11 months of age and usually produce their first litter when they are a year old.\n\nGestation occurs over a period of 44 to 45 days. Earliest litters appear in late January; most births occur in mid-March and July. The average litter size is three, but can vary according to season and food conditions.\n\nTree cavities, usually those formed by woodpeckers, are remodeled to winter dens and often serve as nurseries for late winter litters. If existing trees lack cavities, leaf nests known as dreys are built by cutting twigs with leaves and weaving them into warm, waterproof shelters. Similar leafy platforms are built for summer litters and are often referred to as \"cooling beds.\"\n\nTree squirrels develop slowly compared to other rodents. At birth, the young are blind, without fur and helpless. Eyes open at 4 to 5 weeks of age and ears open at 6 weeks. Eastern fox squirrels are weaned between 12 and 14 weeks but may not be self-supporting until 16 weeks. Juveniles usually disperse in September or October, but may den either together or with their mother during their first winter.\n\nIn captivity, fox squirrels have been known to live 18 years, but in the wild most fox squirrels die before they become adults. Their maximum life expectancy is typically 12.6 years for females and 8.6 years for males. Because of overhunting and the destruction of mature forests, many subspecies of fox squirrel (the Delmarva fox squirrel for example) are endangered. Another major cause of fox squirrel population decline is mange mite (\"Cnemidoptes\" sp.) along with severe winter weather.\n\nRelatively few natural predators can regularly capture adult fox squirrels. Of these predators, most only take fox squirrels opportunistically. Fox squirrel predators include: bobcats (\"Felis rufus\"), foxes (\"Vulpes\" spp. and \"Urocyon\" spp.), red-tailed hawks (\"Buteo jamaicensis\"), red-shouldered hawks (\"Buteo lineatus\"), great horned owls (\"Bubo virginianus\"), barred owls (\"Strix varia\"), and dogs (\"Canis lupus familiaris\"). Nestlings and young fox squirrels are particularly vulnerable to climbing predators such as raccoons (\"Procyon lotor\"), opossums (\"Didelphis virginiana\"), rat snakes (\"Elaphe obsoleta\"), and pine snakes (\"Pituophis melanoleucus\"). In those states where fox squirrels are not protected, they are considered a game animal. Fox squirrels were an important source of meat for European settlers in the 17th and 18th centuries. They are still hunted over most of their range. \n\n\n"}

They were the largest locomotives built by the GWR, apart from the unique Pacific (\"The Great Bear\"). The class was named after kings of the United Kingdom and of England, beginning with the then reigning monarch, King George V, and going back through history. They handled the principal GWR expresses on the main line from London to the West of England and on the GWR main line to Birmingham and Wolverhampton, until 1962 when the class was withdrawn.\n\nBy 1918 it was apparent to the GWR Chief mechanical engineer George Jackson Churchward that his Star Class 4-6-0 locomotives would soon be incapable of handling the heaviest West of England expresses without assistance. He therefore proposed fitting the diameter boiler used on his 4700 Class 2-8-0 on to a 4-6-0 chassis, in 1919, to create a more powerful express locomotive, but was prevented from doing so by the weight restrictions on the GWR main line. The future problem was therefore left for his successor, C.B. Collett to solve.\n\nOn taking up office in 1922, Collett began to develop the more powerful GWR Castle class from Churchward's Star class. However, the design was limited to a maximum axle-loading of due to the weakness of some underline bridges. The new class would not therefore be able to pull 13+ carriage express trains unaided. Following their introduction in 1923 the Castle Class was the most powerful express passenger class in the country in terms of tractive effort, but this honour was lost to the Southern Railway Lord Nelson class in 1926.\n\nThe GWR's General Manager, Sir Felix Pole, was anxious for a new design that would once again enable the company to claim to run the most powerful locomotive. Pole agreed to allow Collett to explore a design for a \"Super-Castle\", subject to getting the tractive effort above . By 1927 a series of bridge renewals had taken place on the Great Western mainlines. This was coupled with the widely known (but as yet unpublished) findings of the Bridge Stress Committee, which gave engineers a better scientific understanding of the impact of hammer blow, and enabled the GWR Civil Engineer to agree to raise the maximum allowable axle-loading to for the new ‘Super Castle’ class.\n\nAlthough Collett was nominally responsible for the design of the class, the detailed work was undertaken by his Chief draughtsman Frederick Hawksworth. The bulk of the increase in power over the Castle class was initially achieved through raising the boiler pressure to a maximum of and by increasing the cylinder stroke from to . These factors together increased the tractive effort to around , slightly below the figure required by Pole.\n\nAs a means of increasing the tractive effort to bring it closer to the requested by Pole, smaller 6 ft 6 in (1.981 m) driving wheels were used compared to the standard 6 ft 8.5 in (2.045 m) on the \"Castles\" and the first six locomotives to be built had their cylinders bored out to giving a further , thereby enabling the ‘Kings’ to achieve a tractive effort of . The smaller wheels also allowed for a wider boiler within the loading gauge to be used.\n\nLater operational experience showed that loading gauge clearance of the outer cylinders was problematic, resulting in their replacement on each locomotive's first major overhaul, which resulted in a reduced tractive effort of .\n\nThe new, long, GWR ‘Standard No.12’ boiler was only used on this class. It had a maximum diameter of tapering to . There were 171 x fire tubes, and 16 x flue tubes. The firebox area | , with a tube area of . As built they had 96 × superheater tubes.\n\nTo accommodate larger inner cylinders the distinctive design of the leading bogie was adopted, with outside bearings on the fore wheel and inside bearings on the rear wheel.\n\nTwenty locomotives were ordered from the GWR Swindon Works in 1927 (Lot 243). The first locomotive No. 6000 \"King George V\", appeared in June 1927. It was followed by five others (6001-6005) a month later. The remaining fourteen (6006-6019) appeared at almost weekly intervals between February and July 1928. A second batch of ten locomotives (6020-6029 Lot 267) appeared between May and August 1930. \n\nNo. 6007 \"King William III\" was written off after an accident near on 15 January 1936, and was condemned on 5 March 1936. A replacement was built (Lot 309) which may have incorporated some parts from the damaged locomotive; it took the same number and name, and was added to stock on 24 March 1936.\n\nIt was originally intended that the class be named after notable cathedrals, but, following an invitation to feature a GWR locomotive in the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's (B&O) centenary celebrations, the GWR decided to make them more notable by naming the class after British Kings. \n\nFollowing the death of King George V in 1936, No. 6029 ‘King Stephen’ was renamed ‘King Edward VIII’ after his successor; and following the abdication of the latter in the same year, No. 6028 ‘King Henry II’ was renamed ‘King George VI’ after the new King.\n\nThe class proved to be successful and able to cope with the heaviest express trains at a higher-speed timetable average than the \"Castle\". Due to their size and weight, the King class was however restricted to the London-Taunton-Plymouth (via both Bristol and ) and the London-Birmingham-Wolverhampton (via Bicester) main lines. The class was therefore used on the GWR's crack expresses such as the Cornish Riviera Limited until the end of regular steam hauled express services on the Western Region of British Railways, although they needed assistance for the heaviest services over the South Devon Banks between Newton Abbot and Plymouth. They were unable to serve in Cornwall, due to the weakness of the Royal Albert Bridge, and so when they were hauling the Cornish Riviera Limited, they had to be swapped for a 'Castle' or 'Hall' at Devonport.\n\nAfter six months of operation, No. 6000 was shipped to North America in August 1927 to join in Baltimore & Ohio Centenary celebrations, where its sleek appearance and smooth performance impressed all who witnessed it. \"King George V\" was presented with a brass bell and cabside medallions to mark the occasion.\nThe application of pressurised oil lubrication showed its advantages over the largely grease-lubricated American Locomotives, and was even incorporated into a later design for the B&O in 1928.\nNo. 6014 was partially streamlined in March 1935 with a hemispherical smokebox door, continuous splashers, straight nameplate and a swept-back cab front. However, the appendages were soon removed, with the exception of the cab. \n\nThe class proved to be capable and reliable when using the high-calorific South Wales steam coal, on which the GWR had always relied for its good locomotive performance. However, during the 1948 locomotive exchanges, \"King Henry VI\" performed disappointingly using Yorkshire coal, despite demonstrating the 4-6-0 type's unique sure-footedness when climbing out of Kings Cross, where pacific types were apt to slip alarmingly.\n\nAs originally built the class had a Swindon superheater with an area of . However, in 1947 experiments were undertaken with a four-row high-degree superheater in No. 6022 \"King Edward III\". As a result, the four-row superheaters were fitted to the whole class, and modifications were also made to the draughting arrangement, using No. 6001 \"King Edward VII\" as a test-bed. From September 1955, double blast-pipes and chimneys were fitted, initially to No. 6015 \"King Richard III\". Following successful testing the whole of the class was subsequently modified and, as a result, their final years in British Railways ownership saw the very best of their performance, particularly on the steep South Devon Banks at Dainton, Rattery, and Hemerdon.\n\nThe entire class was withdrawn in 1962 and replaced by the Western Region's short-lived diesel hydraulic \"Western\" Class locomotives.\n\nThere have been two serious accidents involving the class.\n\nThirty-one locomotives were built at Swindon, although only 30 were in service simultaneously:\n\nAs a result of its previous broad-gauge system, the GWR had the largest loading gauge of all the pre-nationalisation railways in the UK. To allow for maximum power creation and resultant speed, the GWR designed the King class to its maximum mainline loading gauge, specifically a maximum height allowance of . Consequently, this restricted them as to where they could operate under both GWR and British Railways ownership.\n\nDevelopments in high-speed rail from the 1970s mean that ballast depths have increased, resulting in a present decrease in UK pan-network loading gauge height. This has recently started to be reversed with the introduction of pan-European loading gauge standards on some mainlines, mainly originating from ports. The present result of these civil engineering changes is that an original height King locomotive would not pass through various points of the modern Network Rail system, designed to a loading gauge height of . \n\nAll three preserved Kings have been on the mainline in preservation but only 6000 \"King George V\" and 6024 \"King Edward I\" have operated on the main line.\n\nFaced with a choice of either not operating their locomotives on the mainline or modifying to allow them to pass within the current restricted UK loading gauge, private societies choose to reduce the height of their locomotives by by: reducing cab and chimney height; modifying some upper pipe work. The National Railway Museum, owners of 6000 \"King George V\", decided to keep this locomotive in its original condition.\n\nThe Borough of Swindon commissioned a new coat of arms when it became a unitary authority in 1997. The coat of arms includes an image of 6000 \"King George V\" on the shield, recognising the importance of the Swindon works in the development of Swindon. The coat of arms of the old Borough of Swindon (1900–74) included an image of GWR 3031 Class 3029 \"White Horse\".\n\n\n"}

So far, Ancaster is the only place where inscriptions to this god have been found. \n\nThe first inscribed stone was discovered in 1961 in a grave in Ancaster. R.P. Wright reports the find thus: \n\nThe Latin inscription may be translated in English as: \"For the god Viridius, Trenico made this arch, donated from his own funds\". This stone is now in The Collection Museum in Lincoln.\n\nA second inscribed stone was discovered in 2001 by British Channel 4 Television's archaeological programme \"Time Team\". The stone was discovered as part of a late Roman or early Sub-Roman \"cist\" burial, being used as a side slab in the grave. Located near the grave where the first inscribed stone was found, the inscription on this second stone reads:\n\nDIO VRID\n\nSANCT\n\nwhich has been interpreted as: \"To the holy god Viridios\".\n\nThe Ancaster inscriptions are in Latin, suggesting that the name of the god is also in Latin. If so, the name is used in the dative form, meaning \"to (the deity)\". The nominative form, and therefore the name of the god, would be Viridius or Viridios. Because of the Latin word viridis (\"green, fresh, vigorous\"), the simplest etymology proposed is that the god's name derives from this root word and refers to a local, tribal Roman god possessing these characteristics. The Green Man is a well-known pagan mythic personage whose human face sprouting green leaves or vines is found in some medieval churches.\n\nSignificant speculation exists as to the possible Celtic origins of the deity. Wright specifically addresses such speculations, but notes that such a connection cannot be affirmatively made as there are no firm historico-linguistic connections in evidence between the modern conception of Viridios as a Celtic deity and the god Viridios referenced on the inscriptions: \n\nAn additional limestone figurative carving, probably used as an altarpiece, was also found near Ancaster and dated to the late Iron Age. The carving depicts a naked man holding an axe, standing beneath an archway. While no inscriptions appear on the stone, the location of the find near Ancaster, and the features displayed on the god that may depict suggested meanings of the name Viridios (\"mighty, virile, verdant, fertile\"), have led some to speculate that the altarpiece is a depiction of the god Viridios.\n\n\n"}

It can also be used for radiolabeling.\n\nThis process is called nick translation because the DNA to be processed is treated with DNAase to produce single-stranded \"nicks\". This is followed by replacement in nicked sites by DNA polymerase I, which elongates the 3' hydroxyl terminus, removing nucleotides by 5'-3' exonuclease activity, replacing them with dNTPs. To radioactively label a DNA fragment for use as a probe in blotting procedures, one of the incorporated nucleotides provided in the reaction is radiolabeled in the \"alpha\" phosphate position. Similarly, a fluorophore can be attached instead for fluorescent labelling, or an antigen for immunodetection. When DNA polymerase I eventually detaches from the DNA, it leaves another nick in the phosphate backbone. The nick has \"translated\" some distance depending on the processivity of the polymerase. This nick could be sealed by DNA ligase, or its 3' hydroxyl group could serve as the template for further DNA polymerase I activity. Proprietary enzyme mixes are available commercially to perform all steps in the procedure in a single incubation.\n\nNick translation could cause double-stranded DNA breaks, if DNA polymerase I encounters another nick on the opposite strand, resulting in two shorter fragments.

The case was settled in late 1910, when Gould paid De Voie $10,000.\n\nGould's married his second wife, Edith Kelly, in 1910, divorcing in 1919. Edith was the sister of Hetty Kelly, who was Charlie Chaplin's first true love. Gould was married to his third wife, Florence La Caze (1895–1983), from 1923 until his death. Together Gould and La Caze collected impressionist artwork.\n\nIn 1909, he founded the \"Virginia Railway and Power Company\" in Richmond, Virginia. The company would be renamed \"Virginia Electric and Power Company\", and known widely by its acronym (VEPCO) in 1925. The company became \"Virginia Power\" in the 1980s and operates today under the name Dominion Resources, serving Virginia, North Carolina with electric power and half a dozen other Middle Atlantic states providing natural gas services.\n\nHe moved to France and developed several casinos and hotels at the French Riviera. He made a great contribution in the development of multiple spa towns including Granville, Bagnoles-de-l'Orne and Juan-les-Pins. In 1926 he opened the Hotel \"Le Provençal\" in Juan-les-Pins.\n\nHe died on April 1, 1956, in Juan-les-Pins. He was buried in the Jay Gould Mausoleum in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.\n\nThe history of his investments in France is described in the documentary film \"Hotel Provencal\" (2000), by German filmmaker Lutz Hachmeister.\n\n"}

He was briefly a member of the James–Younger Gang, a band of outlaws that also included the infamous Jesse James.\n\nHe was the 11th child of Henry Washington Younger and Bersheba Leighton Fristoe's 14 children and their fifth son, the fourth to survive into adulthood.\n\nIn July 1862, his father was shot and killed while on a business trip to Kansas City by a detachment of Union militiamen. As a result of this killing, several of John's brothers joined Quantrill's Raiders, but John and his younger brother Bob were too young to join so they stayed at home to look after their mother and sisters.\n\nIn January 1866, Bob and John took their mother to Independence, Missouri, to purchase winter supplies. Recognizing the family from his military days an ex-soldier named Gillcreas came up to the wagon and made some comments about Cole. John told him to be quiet and the soldier slapped him around the face with a frozen fish. John got out his brother's pistol (Cole's that they had taken to be repaired) and shot him between the eyes.\n\nAfter an examination of the body it was revealed the soldier was carrying a heavy slingshot that still was tied to his wrist, so the killing was ruled as self-defense.\n\nThe Youngers headed to Texas for a peaceful life until illness fell on Bersheba so the boys (with the exception of Cole) took her back to Missouri to die.\n\nAs soon as they arrived they were harassed, Bob was knocked unconscious, and John was hung four times, and the fourth time they hung him the rope dug deep into his flesh. They cut him down and hacked at the body with knives. He survived. Witnessing this was too much for Bersheba and she died on June 6, 1870, her 54th birthday.\n\nAfter Bersheba's funeral John and Bob met up with Jim and, because it was not safe to stay in one place, they often moved between Missouri and Texas.\n\nOn January 20, 1871, he shot and killed two Texas deputy sheriffs.\n\nIn 1873 Jim, John and Bob Younger joined the James–Younger Gang.\n\nOn March 17, 1874, Jim and John were headed to some friends in Roscoe, Missouri. Three men, local deputy sheriff Edward Daniels and two Pinkerton detectives asked them for directions. Suspecting that they were detectives Jim and John ambushed them. One of the agents fled. While interviewing the remaining two, the detective, Andrew Hamlit aka Louis Lull, drew a hidden pistol and shot John through the neck. Jim killed Deputy Daniels, while John pursued Lull on horseback to nearby woods, fatally wounding him in the chest. Emerging from the woods still on horseback, as Jim ran towards him, John swayed and fell dead. Jim buried him by the roadside to avoid the law digging him up. Later he removed his body to bury him in an unmarked grave in the cemetery. Louis Lull died three days later. John Younger is buried in the Yeater-Cleveland Cemetery in St. Clair County, Missouri, about 4–5 miles NW of Oceola, MO.\n\nGuthrie, Judith W. 1999. St. Clair County History. Volume II. Cemeteries.

Having played 408 La Liga matches over 14 seasons (57 goals), he possessed a vast array of skills: dribble, shot and physique, and his career was almost exclusively associated with Valladolid and Atlético Madrid.\n\nCaminero represented Spain in the 1994 FIFA World Cup and the 1996 UEFA European Championship, scoring in both tournaments.\n\nAfter unsuccessfully emerging through the ranks of Real Madrid, Madrid-born Caminero signed with Real Valladolid for 1989–90, helping the side barely avoid La Liga relegation. He scored his first goal in the competition in the following season, in a 3–1 home win against Valencia CF on 16 December 1990.\n\nThe peak of Caminero's career took place from 1993–94, when he moved to Atlético Madrid. He was a key member of the squad that won an historical double in 1995–96, contributing with nine league goals in 37 games; accordingly, after the season, he was given the Spanish Footballer of the Year award by both the Madrid newspaper \"El País\" and the prestigious football magazine \"Don Balón\", being the only Atlético player to win both awards during one season, and netted a career-best 14 goals the following campaign.\n\nAfter four seasons at Atlético, Caminero re-joined Valladolid, where he ended his active playing career in 2004 after the team's top level relegation.

She was a core member of the Budapest School philosophical forum in the 1960s and later taught political theory for 25 years at the New School for Social Research in New York City. She lived, wrote and lectured in Budapest.\n\nÁgnes Heller was born on May 12, 1929 to Pal Heller and Angela Ligeti. They were a middle-class Jewish family. During World War II her father used his legal training and knowledge of German to help people get together the necessary paperwork to emigrate from Nazi Europe. In 1944, Heller's father was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp where he died before the war ended. Heller and her mother managed to avoid deportation.\n\nWith regard to the influence of the Holocaust on her work, Heller said:\n\nIn 1947, Heller began to study physics and chemistry at the University of Budapest. She changed her focus to philosophy, however, when her boyfriend at the time urged her to listen to the lecture of the philosopher György Lukács, on the intersections of philosophy and culture. She was immediately taken by how much his lecture addressed her concerns and interests in how to live in the modern world, especially after the experience of World War II and the Holocaust.\n\nHeller joined the Communist Party that year, 1947, while at a Zionist work camp and began to develop her interest in Marxism. However, she felt that the Party was stifling the ability of its adherents to think freely due to its adherence to democratic centralism . She was expelled from it for the first time in 1949, the year that Mátyás Rákosi came into power and ushered in the years of Stalinist rule.\n\nAfter 1953 and the installation of Imre Nagy as Prime Minister, Heller was able to safely undertake her doctoral studies under the supervision of Lukács, and in 1955 she began to teach at the University of Budapest.\n\nThe 1956 Hungarian Revolution was the most important political event of her life, for at this time she saw the effect of the academic freedoms of Marxist critical theory as dangerous to the entire political and social structure of Hungary. Heller saw the uprising as confirming her ideas that what Marx really means for the people is to have political autonomy and collective determination of social life.\n\nLukács, Heller and other critical theorists emerged from the Revolution with the belief that Marxism and socialism needed to be applied to different nations in individual ways, effectively questioning the role of the Soviet Union in Hungary's future. These ideas set Heller on an ideological collision course with the new Moscow-supported government of János Kádár: Heller was again expelled from the Communist Party and she was dismissed from the University in 1958 for refusing to indict Lukács as a collaborator in the Revolution. She was not able to resume her research until 1963, when she was invited to join the Sociological Institute at the Hungarian Academy as a researcher (Tormey 4–18) (Grumley 5–15). \n\nFrom 1963 can be seen the emergence of what would later be called the \"Budapest School\", a philosophical forum that was formed by Lukács to promote the renewal of Marxist criticism in the face of practiced and theoretical socialism. Other participants in the Budapest School included together with Heller her second husband Ferenc Fehér, György Márkus, Mihály Vajda and some other scholars with the looser connection to the school (such as András Hegedüs, István Eörsi, János Kis and György Bence).\n\nHeller's work from this period, concentrated on themes such as what Marx means to be the character of modern societies; liberation theory as applied to the individual; the work of changing society and government from \"the bottom up,\" and affecting change through the level of the values, beliefs and customs of \"everyday life\".\n\nUntil the events of the 1968 Prague Spring, the Budapest School remained supportive of reformist attitudes towards socialism. After the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact forces and the crushing of dissent, however, the School and Heller came to believe that the Eastern European regimes were entirely corrupted and that reformist theory was apologist. Heller explains in her interview with Polony that:\n\nThis view was completely incompatible with Kadar's view of Hungary's political future after the Revolution of 1956. According to an interview with Heller in 2010 in the German newspaper \"Jungle World\", she thought that political and criminal processes after 1956 were antisemitic.\n\nAfter Lukács died in 1971, the School's members were victims of political persecution, were made unemployed through their dismissal from their university jobs, and were subjected to official surveillance and general harassment. Rather than remain as dissidents, Heller and her husband the philosopher Ferenc Fehér, along with many other members of the core group of the School, chose exile in Australia in 1977.\n\nHeller and Fehér encountered what they regarded as the sterility of local culture and lived in relative suburban obscurity close to La Trobe University in Melbourne, and they assisted in the transformation of \"Thesis Eleven\" from a labourist journal to a leading Australian journal of social theory before its subsequent conversion to \"American civilization\" (Tormey 4–18)(Grumley 5–15).\n\nAs described by Tormey, Heller's mature thought during this time period was based on the tenets that can be attributed to her personal history and experience as a member of the Budapest School, focusing on the stress on the individual as agent; the hostility to the justification of the state of affairs by reference to non-moral or non-ethical criteria; the belief in \"human substance\" as the origin of everything that is good or worthwhile; and the hostility to forms of theorizing and political practice that deny equality, rationality and self-determination in the name of \"our\" interests and needs, however defined.\n\nHeller and Fehér left Australia in 1986 to take up positions in The New School in New York City, where Heller held the position of Hannah Arendt Professor of Philosophy in the Graduate Studies Program. Her contribution to the field of philosophy was recognized by the many awards that she received (such as the Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Philosophy, Bremen, 1995) and the Szechenyi National Prize in Hungary, 1995 and the various academic societies that she served on, including the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In 2006 she visited China for a week for the first time.\n\nHeller researched and wrote prolifically on ethics, Shakespeare, aesthetics, political theory, modernity, and the role of Central Europe in historical events. From 1990, Heller was more interested in the issues of aesthetics in \"The Concept of The Beautiful\" (1998), \"Time Is Out of Joint\" (2002), and \"Immortal Comedy\" (2005).\n\nIn 2006, she was the recipient of the Sonning Prize, in 2010 she received the Goethe Medal.\n\nIn 2010, Heller, with 26 other well known and successful Hungarian women, joined the campaign for a referendum for a female quota in the Hungarian legislature.\n\nHeller published internationally renowned works, including republications of her previous works in English, all of which are internationally revered by scholars such as Lydia Goehr (on Heller's \"The Concept of the Beautiful\"), Richard Wolin (on Heller's republication of \"A Theory of Feelings\"), Dmitri Nikulin (on comedy and ethics), John Grumley (whose own work focuses on Heller in \"Agnes Heller: A Moralist in the Vortex of History\"), John Rundell (on Heller's aesthetics and theory of modernity), Preben Kaarsholm (on Heller's \"A Short History of My Philosophy\"), among others.\n\nHeller was Professor Emeritus at the New School for Social Research in New York. She worked actively both academically and politically around the globe. She spoke at the Imre Kertész College in Jena, Germany together with Polish sociologist, Zygmunt Bauman , at the Tübingen Book Fair in Germany speaking together with Former German Justice Minister, Herta Däubler-Gmelin, , and other venues worldwide.\n\nHeller married fellow philosopher István Hermann in 1949. Their only daughter, Zsuzsanna Hermann, was born on 1 October 1952. After their divorce in 1962, Heller married Ferenc Fehér in 1963, also a member of Lukács' circle. Heller and Fehér had a son, Gyorgy Fehér. Ferenc Fehér died in 1994.\n\nÁgnes Heller mentions that prominent Hungarian violinist Leopold Auer was related to her family on her mother's side. Heller is second-cousin of 20th century contemporary composer György Ligeti.\nWhile going for a swim in Lake Balaton on 19 July 2019, Heller drowned at Balatonalmádi.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was located in Landskrona, Sweden.\n\nIn late 1920 the company found itself on the verge of bankruptcy. Through a Dutch company, the German \"Gutehoffnungshütte Aktienverein für Bergbau und Hüttenbereich Oberhausen\" (GHH), invested heavily and gained control of 50% of the shares.\n\nIn 1923 the company manufactured a small number of tracked agricultural tractors based on an American design. The Germans increased their ownership to 61% in 1925, three years later the name was changed to \"AB Landsverk\". In 1929 the German engineer Otto Merker was assigned to Landsverk to develop armoured vehicles, a few prototypes of a German design with both wheels and tracks were manufactured in Landskrona. In 1930 the Swedish Army ordered an armoured car for trials, and a few years later three light tanks on wheels and tracks.\n\nIn 1933 Lithuania ordered six, in 1935 the Netherlands twelve Landsverk L181 and in 1937 an order of thirteen L-180 armoured cars. Landsverk presented the L-60 in 1934, the first tank with torsion-bar suspension. There was some very limited export of armoured cars to other countries like Denmark and Finland. Hungary manufactured the L-60 as the Toldi. The Landsverk anti-II was an AA variant of this tank.\n\nLandsverk built a few L-120 light tanks in the 1930s, one of which was exported to Norway, it was the first tank operated by the Norwegian Army.\n\nDuring the Second World War Landsverk designed and partly manufactured, most of the Swedish Army's tanks. At the conclusion of that conflict Landsverk was confiscated by the Swedish state and sold to Kockums.\n\nThe Irish Army operated several Landsverk vehicles over the last 80 years. Two L-60 tanks were purchased in 1935 as training vehicles to supplement the single Vickers Mk D. Although three tanks were of dubious military value, budget constraints prevented additional purchases. Both were out of service by 1953 due to a lack of tracks. Both are still in existence, one has been restored to working condition.\n\nThe Irish Army also used the L-180 armoured car. The type was adopted to replace the aging Rolls Royce fleet in 1937. Eight were delivered by 1939, but the last five on order were never delivered due to the outbreak of the Second World War (they were instead taken over and used by Sweden). The same was the case with many other vehicles in the Irish Army, budget constraints meant that the L180s were still in front-line service (albeit up-gunned with 20mm cannon) until 1972. Incredibly, they were then transferred to the Irish Army Reserve, the FCA, where they were kept in service until the mid-1980s. Five are preserved, including one donated to the Swedish Army.\n\nThe Landsverk Company produced an armoured scout car based on the Unimog S404 in the late 1950s. The Irish Army purchased 15 of the vehicles (originally intended for the police force in the Belgian Congo), in 1971 at a bargain price. They were intended as a stop-gap vehicle for use until the first Panhard M3 VTT APCs entered service in 1972. The type had excellent off-road capability but poor on-road handling due to a high centre of gravity and several accidents occurred as a result. A four-man dismountable squad arrangement was carried, but space was cramped and in any case a four-man detachment was far too small for any sort of realistic military purpose. Other criticisms were that the gunner's position was too exposed. Eventually the Unimog Scout Cars arrived in Ireland in February 1972, their departure having been delayed by a local peace group who thought they were destined for the Provisional Irish Republican Army. By mid-1978 all had been transferred to the Irish Army Reserve, the FCA. All were withdrawn by 1984, two are preserved; one in the transport museum in Howth Co Dublin and one in England.\n\n\n"}

In La Liga, he amassed totals of 196 games and three goals during ten seasons.\n\nBarragán earned 21 caps for Spain at youth level.\n\nBorn in Pontedeume, Galicia, Barragán signed for Liverpool in July 2005, as an 18-year-old who had yet to appear for Sevilla FC's first team.\n\nHe would, however, spend the 2005–06 season with the club's reserves, managing one appearance for the first team, as a substitute for fellow Spaniard Fernando Morientes in the first leg of the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League against PFC CSKA Sofia. In doing so, he became the youngest foreigner to play for the \"Reds\".\n\nOn 4 August 2006, Barragán signed a five-year contract with La Liga club Deportivo de La Coruña, in an operation that cost €1 million. His time at his new team began well, as he was in the starting eleven for the first eight matches and scored against Real Sociedad in a 2–0 home win, subsequently alternating in the right-back position with Manuel Pablo until he fractured his knee in April 2008, being out of action for the rest of the campaign and not featuring at all in 2008–09.\n\nIn 2008, Deportivo released Barragán from his contract without his consent. He successfully sued the club for an indemnity of €400.000, even though it later decided to reverse its previous decision and restore him to the squad.\n\nIn early June 2009, Barragán moved to Real Valladolid, on a three-year link. He played one season apiece in each of the two major levels of Spanish football, appearing in 17 league games in 2009–10 (14 starts) as the campaign ended in relegation.\n\nOn 30 August 2011, Valladolid announced that Barragán would be leaving for Valencia CF in a deal worth €1.5 million. During his first season, all three right-backs – himself, Bruno and Miguel– appeared in roughly the same number of games as the \"Che\" finished third and once again qualified to the Champions League.\n\nBarragán scored his first competitive goal for Valencia on 13 March 2014, his team's first in a 3–0 away win against PFC Ludogorets Razgrad in the campaign's UEFA Europa League. He continued battling for first-choice status with another Portuguese, João Pereira.\n\nOn 5 January 2015, Barragán netted his first league goal for the side, equalising in an eventual 2–1 home win over Real Madrid which ended the visitors' club record 22-match unbeaten run.\n\nBarragán returned to England after ten years on 15 July 2016, agreeing to a three-year deal with Middlesbrough. He made his Premier League debut on 13 August, playing the full 90 minutes in a 1–1 home draw against Stoke City.\n\nOn 6 July 2017, Barragán returned to Spain and its first division after agreeing to a one-year loan deal with Real Betis. Roughly one year later, the move was made permanent.\n\nBarragán was part of the Spain under-19 team that emerged victorious at the 2006 UEFA European Championship in Poland. Just a few months later, following solid performances with Deportivo and former Sevilla teammate Antonio Puerta's call-up to the senior side, he was promoted to the under-21s.\n\nIn December 2006, Barragán appeared for the Galicia unofficial team in a friendly match against Ecuador.\n\n"}

Bennett's mother told him his father was Charles Bennett, a civil engineer killed in a boiler explosion, though he thought it was actor Kyrle Bellew (1855-1911). Bennett had an elder brother, Eric, and a younger brother, Vere.\n\nBennett was a child actor, appearing in Max Reinhart's production of \"The Miracle\" at Olympia Theatre in 1911. He played child roles in stage productions of \"Alice in Wonderland\" (1913), \"Goody Two Shoes\" (1913), \"Drake\" (1914) and \"The Marriage Market\" (1915), and toured in productions all over England.\n\nHe had a role in the film \"John Halifax, Gentleman\" (1915). The performance was not particularly well received and Bennett became an extra and assistant to Adrian Brunel. He continued to appear in stage in productions of \"The Speckled Band\" (1916), \"King Lear\"(1916) with Sir Herbert Tree and \"Raffles\" (1917).\n\nIn 1917 he enlisted in the army and served with the Royal Fusiliers. Most of his war service was spent on the Somme, where he saw action. He was awarded the Military Medal and ended the war with the rank of lieutenant. He was invalided out due to a gas attack and left the army in 1919.\n\nBennett resumed his acting career, playing with the \"Brewster's Millions\" company (1920), then the Compton Comedy Company, the Lena Ashwell Players, the Gertrude Elliott Touring Company, and the Henry Baynton Company (for whom he appeared in \"Anthony and Cleopatra\" and \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\").In 1923 he joined the Alexander Marsh Shakespearean company, touring throughout England.\n\nIn 1925 Bennett joined the Ben Greet Repertory, which performed in Paris from 1925 to 1926. During this time, while acting in the evenings he wrote his first three full-length plays: \"The Return\", based on his war service, \"Blackmail\" and \"The Last Hour\".\n\nIn December 1926 Bennett played Theseus in a production of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" at London's Winter Garden Theatre. In April 1927 he was in a production of \"Othello\" alongside John Gielgud, Robert Loraine and Gertrude Eliot.\n\nIn May 1927 Bennett appeared in a production of his own play \"The Return\", which he also directed. Peggy Ashcroft was in the cast.\n\nIn December 1927 he appeared in Loraine's production of \"Cyrano de Bergerac\".\n\nBennett had the biggest success of his career to date when Al Woods decided to finance a production of \"Blackmail\" in 1928, produced by Raymond Massey and starring Tallulah Bankhead. The play was not well received at first, but had a hugely successful run on tour.\n\nThe play was seen by Alfred Hitchcock who arranged for British International Pictures to buy the film rights and adapted Bennett's play into a script, with Benn Levy doing the dialogue. His film of \"Blackmail\" (1929) is generally credited as the first British sound film, and was a huge commercial success.\n\nBennett's play \"The Last Hour\" debuted on London stage in December 1928 and was a popular hit in London. \"The Last Hour\" (1930) was turned into a movie directed by Walter Forde, the first \"talkie\" for Nettleford Studios.\n\nBennett's fourth play was \"The Danger Line\" (1929), based on Hazel May Marshall's story \"Ten Minutes to Twelve\". He also wrote a one act play \"After Midnight\" (1929).\n\nThe success of \"Blackmail\" led to British International offering him a contract in September 1931 to deliver three film stories a year for two years. He was reunited with Alfred Hitchcock and they collaborated on a story for Bulldog Drummond, to be called \"Bulldog Drummond's Baby\". However Hitchcock then directed some films which flopped and BIP chose not to proceed with the project.\n\nWhile at BIP he did unfilmed stories for \"Death on the Footplate\", \"The Parrot Whistles\", \"High Speed\", \"Love My Dog\" and \"Fireman Save My Child\".\n\nBennett provided the story for a number of low-budget movies for George King who he later called the \"world's worst director\": \"Number, Please\" (1931); \"Deadlock\" (1931), which was a big hit; \"Midnight\" (1931), the latter based on his play; and \"Two Way Street\" (1932).\n\nBennett wrote and directed the play \"Sensation\" (1931), a melodrama, but it was not a success, although it was adapted into a film.\n\nHe followed it with another play \"Big Business\" (1932), which Bennett also directed and appeared in alongside his then-wife Maggie. But by now he had given up acting to focus on writing.\n\nBennett wrote a short film, \"Partners Please\" (1932), and did an early film for John Paddy Carstairs, \"Paris Plane\" (1933).\n\nBennett wrote \"Mannequin\" (1933); \"The House of Trent\" (1933); \"Matinee Idol\" (1933) for King; \"Hawley's of High Street\" (1933), a rare comedy for Bennett; \"The Secret of the Loch\" (1934), the first film shot on location in Scotland; \"Warn London\" (1934); an adaptation of his play \"Big Business\" (1934); and \"Gay Love\" (1934). A number of these films were written in collaboration with publicist and story writer Billie Bristow; she and Bennett would work on eight films together in all.\n\nIn 1934 he wrote the play \"Heart's Desire\" which he later regarded as the best play he wrote and the only one he loved but it was never produced.\n\nHitchcock moved over to Gaumont British where he got Michael Balcon interested in \"Bulldog Drummond's Baby\". It was eventually filmed as \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" (1934), which was a significant success.\n\nAfter doing \"Night Mail\" (1935) with Bristow, Bennett wrote \"The 39 Steps\" (1935) for Hitchcock, a film which soon established itself as a classic; Bennett said he was responsible for most of the film's construction, but paid tribute to the contribution of Ian Hay, who did dialogue.\n\nBennett was now in much demand. He wrote \"The Clairvoyant\" (1935) with Claude Rains and Fay Wray; \"King of the Damned\" (1935), written with Sidney Gilliat; \"All at Sea\" (1936); \"Blue Smoke\" (1935).\n\nHe did two films for Hitchcock, \"Secret Agent\" (1936) and \"Sabotage\" (1936).\n\nIn January 1936 his play \"Page From a Diary\", starring Greer Garson, had a short run in London.\n\nBennett was one of several writers on \"King Solomon's Mines\" (1937) then he went back to Hitchcock for \"Young and Innocent\" (1937).\n\nBennett's work with Hitchcock had made him perhaps the most highly regarded screenwriter in England (one paper called him \"Britain's best known blood curdler\") and attracted the attention of Hollywood. In 1937 he accepted a contract with Universal Studios at $1,500 a week.\n\nUniversal loaned himself out to Sam Goldwyn, and did some uncredited writing on \"The Adventures of Marco Polo\" (1938) and \"The Real Glory\" (1939), then worked on Universal's \"Good Girls Go to Paris\" (1939) and \"Hidden Power\" (1939).\n\nAfter six months Universal dropped Bennett's contract. His agent Myron Selznick got Bennett a job with Myron's brother David. Bennett got his first Hollywood credited on the comedy \"The Young in Heart\" (1938); he did the construction and Paul Osborne the dialogue.\n\nBennett then signed a contract to MGM where he worked on \"Cause for Alarm\", an adaptation of an Eric Ambler novel which ended up not being made, and \"Balalaika\" (1939), a Nelson Eddy musical. He wrote a short novel, \"War in His Pocket\", which was published in 1939.\n\nHitchcock moved to the US and hired Bennett to do some work on \"Foreign Correspondent\" (1940). Bennett was nominated for an Oscar for Best Script.\n\nBennett worked on \"They Dare Not Love\" (1941) at Columbia and did uncredited work on \"Lucky Legs\" (1942). He was hired by Cecil B. De Mille to work on the script construction of \"Reap the Wild Wind\" (1942), which was a huge hit.\n\nBennett went to RKO to write \"Joan of Paris\" (1942), which was one of his favourite films. At that studio he wrote the unproduced \"Challenge to the Night\" and was one of many writers on \"Forever and a Day\" (1943). He also made some uncredited contributions to the script of \"Saboteur\" (1942).\n\nDuring war he claims to have done undercover work for Allied intelligence.\n\nDe Mille used Bennett again on \"The Story of Dr. Wassell\" (1944), once more focusing on construction while Alan Le May did the dialogue. Another script Bennett did for De Mulle, \"Rurales\", about the Mexican Revolution, was never made.\n\nIn 1944 Bennett returned to London to write propaganda films for the British Ministry of Information. He continued to write feature films as well, earning $15,000 from Edward Small for an early draft of \"Lorna Doone\", and an adaptation of the Madeleine Smith story for Two Cities Films to star Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier, at a fee of £4,000. He was contracted to direct the latter. Two Cities contract Bennett to write \"Miracle of Peille\".\n\nAfter the war, Bennett returned to Hollywood and wrote \"Unconquered\" (1947) for De Mille. Olivier and Leigh pulled out of the Madeleine Smith project, so Bennett went to Universal to work on \"Ivy\" (1947), a thriller for Sam Wood and Joan Fontaine.\n\nBennett was going to direct Laraine Day in \"The Trial of Madeleine Smith\"\n\nInstead he worked on the scripts for \"The Sign of the Ram\" (1948) for John Sturges and \"Black Magic\" (1948) for Edward Small. He attempted to remake \"Blackmail\" but was unsuccessful.\n\nBennett finally made his directorial debut in \"Madness of the Heart\" (1949) with Margaret Lockwood.\n\nHe continued to write: the unproduced \"Bangkok\" for Robert North, \"The Search for the Holy Grail\" for De Mille and a film for Rank, \"The Moneyman\".\n\nHe was credited on the script for \"Where Danger Lives\" (1950), where he worked with Irwin Allen for the first time. He also write \"Kind Lady\" (1951), and \"The Green Glove\" (1952), then got another chance to direct with \"No Escape\" (1953), a film noir.\n\nBennett worked on the script for \"Dangerous Mission\" (1954) where he worked with Allen again.\n\nBennett began writing for TV, doing such shows as \"The Ford Television Theatre\", \"Climax!\" (where he did the first screen adaptation of a James Bond novel, \"Casino Royale\"), \"Schlitz Playhouse\", \"Fireside Theatre\", \"Cavalcade of America\", \"The Count of Monte Cristo\", \"Conflict\", \"The Christophers\", \"Lux Video Theatre\" and \"The New Adventures of Charlie Chan\". Some of these he also directed and he produced \"Charlie Chan\".\n\nBennett was reunited with Allen on \"The Story of Mankind\" (1957). He wrote \"Night of the Demon\" (1957) in England, which he had hoped to direct himself; it became a cult success.\n\nHe then did a series of films for Allen: \"The Big Circus\" (1959), \"The Lost World\" (1960), \"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea\" (1961), and \"Five Weeks in a Balloon\" (1962).\n\nBennett also wrote for \"The Dick Powell Show\" and did \"War-Gods of the Deep\" (1965) for AIP.\n\nIn the late 1960s Bennett focused on TV series such as \"The Wild Wild West\", and \"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea\" and \"Land of the Giants\" for Allen.\n\nBennett had no produced credits from the 1970s onwards. \"It was so frustrating, because in many ways I felt my writing had gotten even better,\" he said. \"But at my age, no one wanted to hire me... know, I hate all the talk of this being a young man's industry. I hate it! Not because I'm an old man. But because I hate the notion that you must be young to be hot.\" \n\nBennett continued to write films, plays, treatments and TV series, though none were produced. He wrote a novel, \"Fox on the Run\" which was published in 1987.\n\nIn 1990 Bennett was hired to write a remake of \"Blackmail\". The film was never made.\n\nBennett's brother Eric was killed in World War One in 1915. His other brother hanged himself in 1928.\n\nBennett died in Los Angeles in 1995.\n\n\n\n"}

The song was composed in London in 2004 as one of the last compositions for her debut album and credited to Maya \"M.I.A.\" Arulpragasam, Carol Conners, Bill Conti, Wesley \"Diplo\" Pentz, Ayn Robbins and Deize Tigrona, It was released by XL Recordings in the UK, Interscope Records in the US and Remote Control Records in Australia on 11 July 2005 in 12-inch vinyl and CD single formats. The B-side of the release is the song \"Pull Up the People\" from \"Arular\". Upon release, the song reached number 88 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\"Bucky Done Gun\" is an uptempo baile funk-dancehall song, combining elements of electro, grime, hip hop and pop music. The song is inspired from Tigrona's funk carioca song \"Injeção\" from where a drum loop is included and flipped and airhorns are sampled but recomposed from the song \"Gonna Fly Now\" composed by Conti, Conners and Robbins. The song is produced by Diplo with additional production by Dave \"A. Brucker\" Taylor, P. Byrne and Wizard. The song's title word \"Bucky\" is a reference to the London grime slang word for a gun, while the composition is lyrically influenced by her experiences of civil war in Sri Lanka and how the songwriter viewed the journey of rap music. The song was a critical success, with many contemporary critics complimenting the tough yet raw themes of revolution and sexuality in the song's music direction and lyrics.\n\nThe song's accompanying music video directed by Anthony Mandler was filmed on a desert in Nevada, US. M.I.A. intended for the video to be shot in the favelas in Brazil, but could not shift filming there due to time and budget constraints. The video portrays the singer performing live in an underground nightclub and a desolate wasteland, mixed with scenes of teenagers throwing grenades of smoking colour at buildings. M.I.A and her live backup singer Cherry Byron-Withers provocatively grind against a chain-linked fence and giggling children play in dirty streets and damp landscapes amidst flags of her single artwork. The release of the song and the video's rotation on MTV Brasil marked the first time that a funk carioca-inspired song was played on mainstream radio and music television in Brazil, the genre's country of origin, and contributed towards her rise in popularity there.\n\nM.I.A. performed the song on 3 May 2005 on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and performs the song on her concert tours, first on the Arular Tour and most recently on the /\\/\\ /\\ Y /\\ Tour where it was well appreciated by fans. M.I.A.'s performance of the song and \"Injeção\" with Tigrona at the 2005 in Brazil was a critical and fan success. \"Bucky Done Gun\" was included in the soundtrack of \"NBA Live 06\", renamed and re-edited as \"Bucky Done.\"\n\nThe music video for \"Bucky Done Gun\" was directed by Anthony Mandler. Filming took place in the Mojave desert.\n\nIt features Arulpragasam rapping aggressively against a desolate wasteland with erratic flags bearing her album artwork, erratically interspersed with scenes of her performing live in an underground nightclub, filmed in an artsy, guerrilla style. The video is also mixed with images of teenagers throwing grenades of smoking colour at buildings; Arulpragasam's live backup singer Ms. Cherry provocatively grinding against a chain-linked fence and giggling children playing in dirty streets and damp landscapes.\n\n\"Bucky Done Gun\", as writer W.H. from \"Spin\" notes, led to Brazil being where M.I.A. had enjoyed her most remarkable resonance after the release of \"Arular\". The song became a hit on MTV Brasil after its release, a first for the indigenous music scene of the favelas or urban ghettos in Rio de Janeiro. She stated in an interview from the country during her Arular Tour \"There's a big divide between the classes. Favela Funk is seen as music of the poor people, and 'Bucky' is the first time they've played that sound on commercial radio. It's my first visit here and it's mayhem - me turning up at a funk ball is a big deal. It's kinda complicated.\" Critics have praised the development as encouraging and reflective of the emerging new reality, \"the idea of populist art and populist technology dissolving cultural borders not with some Eurocentric stand-up-for-love sap ballad, but with a politicised 'let's fuck' anthem by a British Sri Lankan, produced by a Mississippi-born American DJ using a Rio de Janeiro ghetto groove.\" Hattie Collins of \"The Guardian\" highlights M.I.A. as a baile funk/political pop pioneer with the release paving the way for bands CSS and Bonde do Rolê to emerge in her wake.\n\nThe musician Mike Shinoda of alternative rock bands Linkin Park and Fort Minor highlighted the song as the latter band's anthem during the European leg of their 2005 tour. A remix of the song was played by DJ AM and Travis Barker during the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nThe song was named the 215th best song of the decade by Pitchfork.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdapted from album liner notes:\n"}
{"id": "2173194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173194", "title": "Stars of CCTV", "text": "Stars of CCTV\n\nStars of CCTV is the debut studio album by English indie rock band Hard-Fi. It was first released on 4 July 2005 through Necessary Records and Atlantic Records. It received positive reviews from critics and was nominated for the 2005 Mercury Music Prize.\n\nThe album reached number one on the UK Albums Chart in January 2006, taking it about five months to reach number one mainly due to the preceding single \"Cash Machine\" catching the sellers' attention; its original peak position was number six. The album has sold 1.2 million copies worldwide, with over 300,000 in the UK alone. It was certified 2× platinum by the BPI for selling 600,000 copies in the UK. The song \"Gotta Reason\" is included on the soundtrack of the football video game \"FIFA 06\".\n\nThe majority of \"Stars of CCTV\" was recorded in a variety of unusual acoustic environments – bedrooms, pubs, and played back in Hard-Fi producer Wolsey White's BMW. 1,000 copies of this record were pressed with only 500 going on public sale, and the initial plan was to sell 1,000 each time. However it quickly sold out, receiving critical acclaim and radio play, proving a lot more successful than the band had imagined. Most of the album was recorded in a disused mini cab office, which cost them about £300, and it is known to this day as the \"Cherry Lips\" Studio (due to the colour of the paint on the walls). The band tried to make their music sound more environmental by putting a microphone in the corridor, which added echo, but background noises caused by people walking past or planes flying overhead could be heard while the band recorded. These background noises can still be heard on the record. The band used the TL Audio Fatman compressor for the album, Archer said \"It's alright, it's cheap, you don't have to know what you're doing...\".\n\n\"Stars of CCTV\" was originally released as a mini album, a very limited release which sold out very quickly. A few months after, the album had been going on sale on websites such as eBay for £25. Talking about the situation, frontman Richard Archer said;\n\n\"We had no money but time was a luxury that we did have. So we spent a year planning, then recording it ourselves, and we did all the artwork ourselves too. Even our website was designed by us. We got a book out of the library so we could learn how to do it. Then we had to do it again cos it was a right palaver . So after all that, things took off really quickly and went crazy in the space of two months, which was quite surprising.\"\n\nThe album's launch party was scheduled for 7 July 2005 at Cheekees night club in Staines (where their top ten single \"Hard to Beat\" was filmed), but this was cancelled due to the ill health of Richard's mother, and the London bombings also occurring that day. Her death resulted in the band pulling out of the Glastonbury festival. The launch party was rescheduled for 13 July 2005 and the venue changed to Ladbroke Grove, London. Richard says that he is no longer friends with Cheekee because of an incident involving him describing his nightclub to a newspaper like \"a bad wedding\". Richard defended himself by saying \"...but everyone likes a bad wedding so I don't see what the problem is.\"\n\nAfter a successful campaign by Atlantic, the \"Stars of CCTV\" album re-entered the official UK album chart at No. 4 on 1 January 2006. Two places higher than it originally went in on the week of its release. It reached No. 1 on 22 January 2006. The band's re-release of \"Cash Machine\" entered the official Top 40 singles chart at No. 14 on 1 January.\n\nThe album was listed for 102 weeks in 7 different charts and was certificated platinum by BPI. Its first appearance in the UK Albums Chart was the Top 75 in week 28 in 2005 with its last appearance being week 40 in 2007 in the UK Album Chart Top 75. Its peak position was number 1 on the UK Album Chart.\n\nOverall \"Stars of CCTV\" received positive reviews and on aggregate website Metacritic the album attained a score of 74 out of 100 based on 22 professional reviews.\n\nThe \"NME\" described the album as \"the album of the year\" and gave the album 9/10 in a very positive review.\n\nDave Simpson of \"The Guardian\" gave the album three stars out of five, writing that \"Hard-Fi's edge over more derivative rivals lies in a formula that delivers old Specials and Clash reggae vibes with the big-tune ratio of a boy band\". He however deemed some of the later tracks on the album \"filler\".\n\nIn a 3.5/5 star review for AllMusic, MacKenzie Wilson wrote that \"They sound like a garage band while delving into the monotony of everyday suburban life, referring to their small town upbringing. Thus a raw kind of work ethic gradually emerges on Stars of CCTV. Their formula of snappy choruses and tight guitar hooks, particularly on \"Middle Eastern Holiday\" and \"Gotta Reason,\" captures Hard-Fi's youthful presentation\".\n\nAll tracks written by Richard Archer.\n\n\n\n\n5 singles from debut album Stars of CCTV were released.\n\nLike all of the Hard-Fi releases, various formats carried subtle changes to differentiate them on the shelf, making them all collectable, such as \"Hard to Beat\"'s changing sky to \"Living for the Weekend\"'s countdown to 18:00.\n\nThe \"Tina\" mentioned on some of the sleeves formed a subplot throughout all the single releases. She later became a bit of a talking point both in the music press and on the fans forums.\n"}

{"id": "2173207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173207", "title": "Alexander Pearce", "text": "Alexander Pearce\n\nAlexander Pearce (1790 – 19 July 1824) was an Irish convict who was transported to the penal colony in Van Diemen's Land (the modern day state of Tasmania), Australia for seven years for theft. He escaped from prison several times. During one of these escapes he allegedly became a cannibal, murdering his companions one by one. In another escape, with one companion, he allegedly killed him and ate him in pieces. He was eventually captured and was hanged and dissected in Hobart for murder.\n\nPearce was born in County Monaghan, Ireland. A Roman Catholic farm labourer, he was sentenced at Armagh in 1819 to penal transportation to Van Diemen's Land for \"the theft of six pairs of shoes\". He continued to commit various petty offences whilst in the penal colony in Van Diemen's Land, from which he soon escaped. The 18 May 1822 edition of the \"Hobart Town Gazette\" reported this escape and advertised a £10 reward for his recapture. When caught, he was charged with absconding and forging an order, a serious crime. For this he received a second sentence of transportation, this time to the new secondary penal establishment at Sarah Island in Macquarie Harbour.\n\nOn 20 September 1822, Pearce along with seven other convicts of Macquarie Harbour Penal Station: Alexander Dalton, Thomas Bodenham, William Kennerly, Matthew Travers, Edward Brown, Robert Greenhill and John Mather escaped while working on the eastern side of the harbour. Greenhill, who had the axe, appointed himself leader, supported by his friend Travers, with whom he had been sent to Macquarie Harbour for stealing businessman Anthony Fenn Kemp's schooner in an attempt to escape. About 15 days into the journey, the men were starving and drew lots to see who would be killed for food. Thomas Bodenham (or perhaps Alexander Dalton: see below) drew the short straw and Greenhill despatched him with an axe. At this point three of the company – Dalton, Kennerly and Brown – took fright and decamped. Kennerly and Brown reached Macquarie Harbour, but Dalton seemed to have died of exhaustion. That left Greenhill, Travers, John Mather and Alexander Pearce. With Greenhill and Travers acting as a team, it would be Mather's or Pearce's turn next. Pearce seems to have sided with Greenhill and Travers at this point, and Mather was the next victim. It was then that Pearce had some luck: Travers was bitten on the foot by a snake. Greenhill insisted they carry him for five days, but when it became clear he would not recover, killed him.\n\nAfter that, it was a cat-and-mouse game. Greenhill had the axe, but they were both starving, and they had to sleep. In the end it was Pearce who prevailed. He grabbed the axe, killed Greenhill and dined on his body. He later raided an Aboriginal campsite and stole more food. When he saw sheep, he knew he had reached the settled districts. He was lucky again, as the shepherd who came upon him eating a lamb was an old friend. Pearce was inducted into a sheep-stealing ring, and was eventually picked up with William Davis and Ralph Churton, who were both hanged for bushranging and escaping from a military escort.\n\nIn total, Pearce had been on the run for 113 days, a little less than half of which was spent in the wilderness. Locked up in Hobart, Pearce made a confession to the Rev. Robert Knopwood, the magistrate and chaplain. However, Knopwood did not believe the cannibalism story and was convinced the others were still living as bushrangers. He sent Pearce back to Macquarie Harbour.\n\nThere are inconsistencies in Pearce's story. He made three confessions – the Knopwood confession; a confession to Lt. Cuthbertson, Commandant of Macquarie Harbour when he was in hospital after the second escape (in this version, Dalton is the first victim); and a confession to Father Phillip Connolly, the colony's Catholic priest, the night before his execution – and some of the details differed. What is incontrovertible is that eight men went into the bush at Macquarie Harbour, and only three came out; and of the four men alive when Dalton, Kennerly and Brown decamped, only one survived.\n\nWithin a year, Pearce escaped a second time, joined by a young convict named Thomas Cox. Pearce was captured within ten days and taken to the Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land in Hobart, where he was tried and convicted of murdering and cannibalising Thomas Cox. Observers noted Pearce did not look like a cannibal. He was only in height, which was under average for that time, but had a strong wiry frame. He did not seem to be someone who was \"laden with the weight of human blood, and believed to have banqueted on human flesh\" as the \"Hobart Town Gazette\" wrote on 25 June 1824. His captors had found parts of Cox's body in Pearce's pockets, even though he still had food left, and his guilt was beyond doubt this time. Pearce confessed he had killed Cox because when they reached King's River, he discovered that Cox could not swim. Pearce was the first felon to be executed by the new Supreme Court and the first confessed cannibal to pass through the Tasmanian court system.\n\nAlexander Pearce was hanged at the Hobart Town Gaol at 9am on 19 July 1824, after receiving the last rites from Father Connolly. It is reported that just before he was hanged, Pearce said, \"Man’s flesh is delicious. It tastes far better than fish or pork.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2173220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173220", "title": "The Subjection of Women", "text": "The Subjection of Women\n\nThe Subjection of Women is an essay by English philosopher, political economist and civil servant John Stuart Mill published in 1869, with ideas he developed jointly with his wife Harriet Taylor Mill. Mill submitted the finished manuscript of their collaborative work \"On Liberty\" (1859) soon after her untimely death in late 1858, and then continued work on \"The Subjection of Women\" until its completion in 1861. At the time of its publication, the essay's argument for equality between the sexes was an affront to European conventional norms regarding the status of men and women.\n\nIn his Autobiography, Mill describes his indebtedness to his wife, and his daughter Helen Taylor for the creation of \"The Subjection of Women\":\n\nMill was convinced that the moral and intellectual advancement of humankind would result in greater happiness for everybody. He asserted that the higher pleasures of the intellect yielded far greater happiness than the lower pleasure of the senses. He conceived of human beings as morally and intellectually capable of being educated and civilised. Mill believed everyone should have the right to vote, with the only exceptions being barbarians and uneducated people.\n\nMill argues that people should be able to vote to defend their own rights and to learn to stand on their two feet, morally and intellectually. This argument is applied to both men and women. Mill often used his position as a member of Parliament to demand the vote for women, a controversial position for the time.\n\nIn Mill's time a woman was generally subject to the whims of her husband or father due to social norms which said women were both physically and mentally less able than men and therefore needed to be \"taken care of.\" Contributing to this view were both hierarchical religious views of men and women within the family and social theories based on biological determinism. The archetype of the ideal woman as mother, wife and homemaker was a powerful idea in 19th century society.\n\nAt the time of writing, Mill recognized that he was going against the common views of society and was aware that he would be forced to back up his claims persistently. Mill argued that the inequality of women was a relic from the past, when \"might was right,\" but it had no place in the modern world. Mill saw that having effectively half the human race unable to contribute to society outside of the home as a hindrance to human development.\n\nMill attacks the argument that women are naturally worse at some things than men and should, therefore, be discouraged or forbidden from doing them. He says that we simply don't know what women are capable of, because we have never let them try – one cannot make an authoritative statement without evidence. We can't stop women from trying things because they might not be able to do them. An argument based on speculative physiology is just that, speculation.\n\nIn this, men are basically contradicting themselves because they say women cannot do an activity and want to stop them from doing it. Here Mill suggests that men are basically admitting that women are capable of doing the activity, but that men do not want them to do so.\n\nWhether women can do them or not must be found out in practice. In reality, we don't know what women's nature is, because it is so wrapped up in how they have been raised. Mill suggests we should test out what women can and can't do – experiment.\n\nWomen are brought up to act as if they were weak, emotional, docile – a traditional prejudice. If we tried equality, we would see that there were benefits for individual women. They would be free of the unhappiness of being told what to do by men. And there would be benefits for society at large – it would double the mass of mental faculties available for the higher service of humanity. The ideas and potential of half the population would be liberated, producing a great effect on human development.\n\nMill's essay is clearly utilitarian in nature on three counts: The immediate greater good, the enrichment of society, and individual development.\n\nIf society really wanted to discover what is truly natural in gender relations, Mill argued, it should establish a free market for all of the services women perform, ensuring a fair economic return for their contributions to the general welfare. Only then would their practical choices be likely to reflect their genuine interests and abilities.\n\nMill felt that the emancipation and education of women would have positive benefits for men also. The stimulus of female competition and companionship of equally educated persons would result in the greater intellectual development of all. He stressed the insidious effects of the constant companionship of an uneducated wife or husband. Mill felt that men and women married to follow customs and that the relation between them was a purely domestic one. By emancipating women, Mill believed, they would be better able to connect on an intellectual level with their husbands, thereby improving relationships.\n\nMill attacks marriage laws, which he likens to the slavery of women, \"there remain no legal slaves, save the mistress of every house.\" He alludes to the subjection of women becoming redundant as slavery did before it. He also argues for the need for reforms of marriage legislation whereby it is reduced to a business agreement, placing no restrictions on either party. Among these proposals are the changing of inheritance laws to allow women to keep their own property, and allowing women to work outside the home, gaining independent financial stability.\n\nAgain the issue of women's suffrage is raised. Women make up half of the population, thus they also have a right to a vote since political policies affect women too. He theorises that most men will vote for those MPs who will subordinate women, therefore women must be allowed to vote to protect their own interests.\n\nMill felt that even in societies as unequal as England and Europe that one could already find evidence that when given a chance women could excel. He pointed to such English queens as Elizabeth I, or Victoria, or the French patriot, Joan of Arc. If given the chance women would excel in other arenas and they should be given the opportunity to try.\n\nMill was not just a theorist; he actively campaigned for women's rights as an MP and was the president of the National Society for Women's Suffrage.\n\nThe way Mill interpreted subjects over time changed. For many years Mill was seen as an inconsistent philosopher, writing on a number of separate issues. Consistency in his approach is based on utilitarianism, and the good of society.\n\nNothing should be ruled out because it is just \"wrong\" or because no one has done it in the past. When we are considering our policies, we should seek the greatest happiness of the greatest number. This leads to attacks on conventional views. If you wish to make something illegal, you need to prove what harm is being done. Individuals know their own interests best.\n\nThe greatest good is understood in a very broad sense to be the moral and intellectual developments of society. Different societies are at different stages of development or civilisation. Different solutions may be required for them. What matters is how we encourage them to advance further. We can say the same for individuals. Mill has a quite specific idea of individual progress: (1) employing higher faculties; (2) moral development, with people placing narrow self-interest behind them.\n\nWe are independent, capable of change and of being rational. Individual liberty provides the best route to moral development. As we develop, we are able to govern ourselves, make our own decisions, and not to be dependent on what anyone else tells us to do. Democracy is a form of self-dependence.\nThis means:\n\n\n\n"}

They exist in many countries and are often affiliated with either the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (through a national body) or the Campus Crusade for Christ. Many Christian unions are one of the societies affiliated to their universities' students' union. As a broader term, \"Christian union\" may refer to any Christian student society, such as SCM and Fusion groups.\n\nSince their split from the Student Christian Movement in the early twentieth century, most Christian Unions in the United Kingdom are affiliated to the Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship (UCCF). Some UK Christian Unions have had difficult relationships with the students' union due to their policy of allowing leaders to choose their successors in order, they argue, to ensure a Christian leadership (students' unions often require democratic processes be followed), opinions on issues such as homosexuality, and the requirement that leaders affirm a fixed Doctrinal Basis. Many, but not all, CUs require all members to sign this Doctrinal Basis. The latter includes doctrinal statements that go beyond the historic ecumenical creeds, \"e.g.\" recognising the Bible as the sole authority, and belief in penal substitution. A considerable number of Christian students have problems affirming these points, and feel excluded from Christian Unions. This has led to calls for local Christian Unions to change their name to something more specific, e.g. Evangelical Christian Union.\n\nChristian Unions are active in evangelism to fellow-students. As well as hosting traditional talks and debates, they may hold unconventional events such as \"Text a Toastie\". These particular events involve providing a number to students, to which they text a question about God, the bible, or Christianity more generally, and in response two members of the Christian Union deliver a toastie to them and answer their question. While considered unusual by some, this has proven an effective way of communicating with other students for many CUs.\n\n\n\nChristian Unions and Student Unions\n"}

{"id": "2173230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173230", "title": "Royal Horse Artillery", "text": "Royal Horse Artillery\n\nThe Royal Horse Artillery (RHA) was formed in 1793 as a distinct arm of the Royal Regiment of Artillery (commonly termed Royal Artillery) of the British Army. Horses are still in service for ceremonial purposes but were phased out from operational deployment during the 1930s.\n\nThe Royal Horse Artillery, currently consists of three regiments, (1 RHA, 3 RHA and 7 RHA) and one ceremonial unit (King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery). Almost all the batteries of the Royal Horse Artillery have served continuously since the French Revolutionary Wars or Napoleonic Wars, except the King's Troop which has existed since 1946 and M Battery which was 'reanimated' in 1993.\n\nIn 1793, in the course of the French Revolutionary Wars, Great Britain and allied European powers declared war on France over French occupation of the Rhine delta and Antwerp, precipitating the Flanders Campaign. Britain remained in conflict with France for almost 22 years, during which time significant progress was achieved in artillery development. The first two troops of Horse Artillery (A – later entitled \"The Chestnut Troop\" – and B) were raised in January 1793 at Goodwood, West Sussex, by the Master-General of the Ordnance, the 3rd Duke of Richmond, to provide fire support for the cavalry. They were joined by two more troops in November 1793. Each troop had six 6-pounder guns. All RHA personnel were mounted. Included in the establishment were 45 drivers and 187 horses, making it the first self-contained fighting unit of artillery.\n\nInitially, horses were hired with civilian drivers. In 1794, a Driver Corps was raised which, however, did not formally become a unit of the Royal Artillery until after Waterloo. There were many disadvantages of the divided control until horses and drivers were organised into the RHA troops. Another development was the formation of a headquarters staff providing a channel between the regiment and the Board of Ordnance. Captain John Macleod was the first brigade major and became the first deputy-adjutant-general in 1795. By 1806, eleven troops had been formed, with ten companies of the Royal Irish Artillery incorporated, as the Seventh Battalion, after the union with Ireland in 1801.\n\nThe regiment wore light cavalry uniforms of blue with gold lace and red facings. Their overalls were grey with a red stripe and on their heads they wore the distinctive Tarleton helmets. If needed, they carried 1796 light-cavalry sabres or their own semi-official RHA 1796P sabre.\n\nThe RHA has acquitted itself with distinction in the great wars of two centuries, the Napoleonic Wars, the Indian Mutiny, the Crimean War, the Peninsular War, the Anglo-Zulu War, the Boer War, World War I and World War II.\n\nIn 1859, the term \"battalion\" was replaced by \"brigade\". (This in turn was replaced by \"regiment\" in 1939.) The five Horse Artillery brigades consisted of two batteries each. Between 1899 and 1924, the Royal Artillery was divided, with the creation of the Royal Field Artillery which utilised horse for its medium-calibre guns.\n\nWhen the Territorial Force was created in 1908, artillery units of the old Volunteer Force were converted into foot, horse, and garrison batteries. There were 14 batteries of horse artillery, 12 of which belonged to the RHA, the remaining two being provided by the Honourable Artillery Company. Territorial batteries were of four guns each rather than the six guns of regular batteries. The principal weapon of Territorial RHA units was the Ordnance QF 15 pounder although the Ordnance BLC 15 pounder was issued to some second-line RHA units formed in 1914.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I the regular RHA comprised twenty-five batteries, eleven of those serving in India with the Indian Army. They were equipped with the Ordnance QF 13 pounder.\n\nIn the 1920s, development of trucks and track vehicles brought an end to operational use of horses. By 1927, medium artillery was drawn by tractors instead of heavy draught horses. By 1937, nine field brigades had been mechanised as well as a brigade of RHA. The last battery to be mechanised was K Battery, in 1939. Today, the ceremonial King's Troop alone retains the panache of the mounted batteries.\n\nAt the onset of World War II, recruits were instructed that \"the role of the Royal Artilleryman is, as it has ever been, to fight his gun, forgetful of self, to the last round in support of other arms.\"\n\nThe following are current units of the Royal Horse Artillery:\n\n\nThe Royal Horse Artillery has provided the Queen's Guard on three occasions:\n\nThe King's Troop provides the Queen's Life Guard in Whitehall for three weeks in August each year while the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment goes away for summer training.\n\n\nWhen on parade with its guns, the Royal Horse Artillery takes precedence over all. Without its guns, the Household Cavalry alone precedes the RHA.\n\n\n"}

His other film work includes \"Duets\", \"Dark Blue\", \"\", \"The Strangers\", \"Barney's Version\", and \"The Vow\".\n\nSpeedman was born in London, to Scottish parents Mary (Campbell), a primary school teacher and champion runner, and Roy Speedman (1944–1999), a department store buyer. His sister, Tracey, died from cancer on February 8, 2016. At the age of four, he and his family moved to Toronto, Ontario. He was a competitive swimmer who attended Earl Haig Secondary School's now defunct gifted athlete program. As a member of the Canadian Junior National Swim Team, Speedman placed ninth at the 1992 Olympic trials. Suffering a neck injury soon after, he was forced to leave the sport. To find a new focus outside of athletics, Speedman became interested in acting. He went on to attend the University of Toronto and York University to study his craft.\n\nEncouraged by a friend to appear on \"Speaker's Corner\", a viewer open-forum run by Toronto's Citytv, Speedman expressed interest in auditioning for the role of Robin in the film \"Batman Forever\", which was being cast in Toronto at the time. Though the appearance earned him an audition, Speedman was not cast in the role, which was ultimately given to Chris O'Donnell. The audition did, however, give Speedman the exposure he needed and he quickly arranged an agent and began auditioning for Canadian television and film roles.\n\nSpeedman's TV debut came in 1995 with the Canadian series \"Net Worth\". He was also in the 1995 TV show \"Nancy Drew\".

The fortress is accessed by the Kastellet ferry, an electrically powered cable ferry across the channel from Vaxholm town. \n\nIn 1970, it was used as a movie location for the pirate stronghold in \"Pippi in the South Seas\". A scenic view of the castle may be seen from the car ferry which plies the short distance between Vaxholm and the island Rindö.\n\nThe fortress was originally constructed by Gustav Vasa in 1548 to defend Stockholm against shipborne attacks from the east. This wooden blockhouse was replaced by a stone tower during Johan III's reign. Most of the current structure dates from 1833–1863. Its design was inspired by the ideas on fortifications propounded by the French engineers Marc René Montalbert and Lazare Carnot. Russian prisoners-of-war were used in part to build the fortress. The stretch of water below the building was formerly the main sea route to Stockholm. Thus, the fortress was strategically situated to defend the city from naval attacks. The Danes attacked it in 1612 and the Russian navy in 1719. \n\nSince the mid-19th century, its military importance has ceased. So weak had the fort become that it was said the great Prussian field marshal von Moltke was only ever seen to smile twice – once when they told him his mother-in-law was dead and again when he saw Vaxholm Fort. Today, it is home to the Swedish National Museum of Coastal Defence.\n\n"}
{"id": "2173280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173280", "title": "Percale", "text": "Percale\n\nPercale is a closely woven plain-weave fabric often used for bed covers. Percale has a thread count of about 200 or higher and is noticeably tighter than the standard type of weave used for bedsheets. It has medium weight, is firm and smooth with no gloss, and warps and washes very well. It is made from both carded and combed yarns, and may be woven of various fibers, such as cotton, polyester, or various blends.\n\nPercale was originally imported from India in the 17th and 18th centuries, then manufactured in France. The word may originate from the Persian \"pargālah\", meaning \"rag\", although the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (as of December 2005) has traced it only as far as 18th-century French. The dictionary of the Institut d'Estudis Catalans describes \"pexal\" and \"perxal\" as \"some kind of silk fabric in the year 1348 in Valencia\". The etymological dictionary of Catalan explains \"perxal\" as \"derived from Perche in France\". \n\nIn the year 1322 in Dalmatia, which had trade connections also as the Republic of Venice, Peter de genere Percal was mentioned. This word \"Percal\", which occurred the first time in a Supreme Court verdict on Latin in 1322 in Dalmatia, derived from the Hebrew word פרקליט (\"prklyt\"), which derived from the Ancient Greek word παράκλητος (\"parákletos\"), which means \"lawyer\". The relationship between bedding and law in ancient Persia can be guessed, because according to Phanias of Eresus, Artaxerxes I of Persia had given to Themistocles the city of Percote with bedding for his house. \n\nTaking into account the different spellings of this \"generatio Percal\" due to the variations \"Parkly\" and \"Perkly\" in Dalmatia, the name of a farm near Linlithgow Palace in Scotland, which had been built in the 14th century by a first cousin of the grandmother of this Peter de genere Percal, was mentioned in 1431 also as \"Parkly\". This farm was also mentioned as \"Parkle\" (1431), \"Perkley\" (1432), \"Parcle\" (1438), \"Perkle\" (1439), \"Parklye\" (1440), \"Parklee\" (1489), \"Perklee\" (1490/91), \"Parklie\" (1528), \"Pairklie\" (1638), \"Pairkly\" (1647) and \"Parkly\" (1648) since then and it is mentioned as \"Parkley\" since 1671.\n\n"}

{"id": "2173288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173288", "title": "Macedonian Muslims", "text": "Macedonian Muslims\n\nThe Macedonian Muslims (), also known as Muslim Macedonians or Torbeši (), and in some sources grouped together with Pomaks, are a minority religious group within the community of ethnic Macedonians in North Macedonia who are Muslims (primarily Sunni, with Sufism being widespread among the population). They have been culturally distinct from the majority Orthodox Christian Macedonian community for centuries, and are ethnically and linguistically distinct from the larger Muslim ethnic groups in the greater region of Macedonia: the Albanians, Turks and Roms. However, some Torbeši also still maintain a strong affiliation with Turkish identity and with Macedonian Turks. The regions inhabited by these Macedonian-speaking Muslims are Debarska Župa, Drimkol, Reka, and Golo Brdo (in Albania).\n\nThe Macedonian Muslims are largely the descendants of Orthodox Christian Slavs from the region of Macedonia who converted to Islam during the centuries when the Ottoman Empire ruled the Balkans. The various Sufi orders (like the Khalwati, Rifa'is and Qadiris) all played a role in the conversion of the Slavic and Paulician population.\n\nThe largest concentration of Macedonian Muslims can be found in western North Macedonia and eastern Albania. Most of the villages in Debar regions are populated by Macedonian Muslims. The Struga municipality also holds a large number of Macedonian Muslims who are primarily concentrated in the large village of Labuništa. Further north in the Debar region many of the surrounding villages are inhabited by Macedonian Muslims. The Dolna Reka region is also primarily populated by Macedonian Muslims. They form the remainder of the population which emigrated to Turkey in the 1950s and 1960s. Places such as Rostuša and Tetovo also have large Macedonian Muslim populations. Most of the Turkish population along the western Macedonian border are in fact Macedonian Muslims. Another large concentration of Macedonian Muslims is in the so-called which is just south of Skopje. There are also major concentrations of Macedonian Muslims in the central region of the Republic of Macedonia, surrounding the Plasnica municipality and the Dolneni municipality.\n\nThe exact numbers of Macedonian Muslims are not easy to establish. The historian Ivo Banac estimates that in the old Kingdom of Yugoslavia, before World War II, the Macedonian Muslim population stood at around 27,000. Subsequent censuses have produced dramatically varying figures: 1,591 in 1953, 3,002 in 1961, 1,248 in 1971 and 39,355 in 1981. Commentators have suggested that the latter figure includes many who previously identified themselves as Turks. Meanwhile, the Association of Macedonian Muslims has claimed that since World War II more than 70,000 Macedonian Muslims have been assimilated by other Muslim groups, most notably the Albanians (see Albanization). It can be estimated that the Macedonian Muslim population in North Macedonia in the year 2013 is 40.000 people.\n\nLike their Christian ethnic kin, Macedonian Muslims speak the Macedonian language as their first language. Despite their common language and racial heritage, it is almost unheard of for Macedonian Muslims to intermarry with Macedonian Orthodox Christians. Macedonian ethnologists do not consider the Muslim Macedonians a separate ethnic group from the Christian Macedonians, but instead a religious minority within the Macedonian ethnic community. Intermarriage with the country's other Muslim groups (Bosniaks, Albanians and Turks) are much more accepted, given the bonds of a common religion and history.\n\nWhen the Socialist Republic of Macedonia was established in 1944, the Yugoslav government encouraged the Macedonian Muslims to adopt an ethnic Macedonian identity. This has since led to some tensions with the Macedonian Christian community over the widespread association between Macedonian national identity and adherence to the Macedonian Orthodox Church.\n\nThe principal outlet for Macedonian Muslim political activities has been the Association of Macedonian Muslims. It was established in 1970 with the support of the authorities, probably as a means of keeping Macedonian Muslim aspirations in control.\n\nThe fear of assimilation into the Albanian Muslim community has been a significant factor in Macedonian Muslim politics, amplified by the tendency of some Macedonian Muslims to vote for Albanian candidates. In 1990, the chairman of the Macedonian Muslims organization, Riza Memedovski, sent an open letter to the Chairman of the Party for Democratic Prosperity of Macedonia, accusing the party of using religion to promote the Albanisation of the Macedonian Muslims. A controversy broke out in 1995 when the Albanian-dominated \"Meshihat\" or council of the Islamic community in North Macedonia declared that Albanian was the official language of Muslims in Macedonia. The decision prompted protests from the leaders and members of the Macedonian Muslim community.\n\nMany Macedonian Muslims are involved in agriculture, and also work abroad. Macedonian Muslims are well known as fresco-painters, wood carvers and mosaic-makers. In the past few decades large numbers of Macedonian Muslims have emigrated to Western Europe and North America.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2173289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173289", "title": "Edward Maria Wingfield", "text": "Edward Maria Wingfield\n\nEdward Maria Wingfield, sometimes hyphenated as \"Edward-Maria Wingfield\" (1550 in Stonely Priory, near Kimbolton – 1631) was a soldier, Member of Parliament, (1593) and English colonist in America. He was the son of Thomas Maria Wingfield, and the grandson of Richard Wingfield.\n\nCaptain John Smith wrote that from 1602 to 1603 Wingfield was one of the early and prime movers and organisers in \"\"showing great charge and industry\"\" in getting the Virginia Venture moving: he was one of the four incorporators for the London Virginia Company in the Virginia Charter of 1606 and one of its biggest financial backers. He recruited (with his cousin, Captain Bartholomew Gosnold) about forty of the 104 would-be colonists, and was the only shareholder to sail. In the first election in the New World, he was elected by his peers as the President of the governing council for one year beginning 13 May 1607, of what became the first successful, English-speaking colony in the New World at Jamestown, Virginia.\n\nAfter four months, on 10 September, because \"\"he ever held the men to working, watching and warding\"\", and because of lack of food, death from disease and attack by the \"naturals\" (during the worst famine and drought for 800 years), Wingfield was made a scapegoat and was deposed on petty charges. On the return of the Supply Boat on 10 April 1608, Wingfield was sent back to London to answer the charge of being an atheist, and one suspected of having Spanish sympathies. Smith's prime biographer, Philip L. Barbour, however, wrote of the \"superlative pettiness of the charges... none of the accusations amounting to anything.\" Wingfield cleared his reputation, was named in the Second Virginia Charter, 1609, and was active in the Virginia Company until 1620, when he was 70 years old. \n\nHe died in England in 1631, ten weeks before fellow Jamestown settler John Smith, and was buried on 13 April at St Andrew's Parish Church, Kimbolton.\n\nWingfield was born in 1550 at Stonely Priory (dissolved ca. 1536), near Kimbolton, Huntingdonshire (present-day Cambridgeshire), the eldest son of Thomas Maria Wingfield, the Elder, and Margaret (née Kaye; from Woodsome, Yorkshire). and was raised as a Protestant His middle name, \"Maria\" (pronounced [mah-RYE-uh]), derived from Mary Tudor, Queen of France, sister of King Henry VIII, not Henry VIII's same named devoutly Catholic daughter, Mary Tudor.\n\nEdward's father, Thomas Maria Wingfield, MP (who had in 1536 renounced his calling as a priest), died when Edward was seven years old. Before he was twelve years of age, his mother remarried, to James Cruwys of Fotheringhay, Northamptonshire, who became his guardian; yet the father figure in his early years appears to have been his uncle, Jacques Wingfield, one of six contemporary martial Wingfields.\n\nJacques Wingfield was from 1559 to 1560 until his death in 1587, Master of the Ordnance in Ireland, Constable of Dublin Castle and an Irish privy councillor. When Edward Maria was 19 years old he apparently accompanied his uncle, one of the key settlers involved in building a plantation in Munster, Ireland, with Sir Humphrey Gilbert and Sir John Popham, among others. His uncle held Wickham Skeith, a manor in Suffolk, next to the future living of the great geographer, Richard Hakluyt, the Younger at Wetheringsett – both some ten miles (16 km) from Letheringham Old Hall, the ancestral home of the Wingfield family, and from Otley Hall, ancestral home of the Wingfields' cousins, the Gosnold family (four miles from Letheringham). \n\nIn 1575–76, Wingfield returned to England, where in 1576 he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn, the law school, having first passed through its \"feeder\", Furnivall's Inn. Before completing his legal training, the lure of the drum called him to the Low Countries. \n\nAlongside his brother, Captain Thomas Maria Wingfield, for at least four years, Edward fought as a foot company commander (i.e. commander of 100 pike-wielding soldiers) in the Low Countries for the Dutch Republic against Spanish invaders, including in 1586 at the Battle of Zutphen, thereby gaining experience in the defence of forts and in skirmishing. He, his brother and Sir William Drury, were noted in the Army Roll of 1589 as \"\"captains of success\"\". In the first half of 1588 he was taken prisoner together with the virginiaphile Sir Ferdinando Gorges (later Governor of Plymouth), at or near Bergen-op-Zoom, and was held in Spanish captivity with him, first at Ghent and then at Lille until on 5 September 1588 when ransoms were demanded. Nine weeks later his brother captured two Spanish officers at Bergen, but was not permitted by the Allied Commander-in-Chief, Peregrine Bertie, 13th Baron Willoughby de Eresby, to exchange them (though he was mysteriously paid later). He and Gorges were, however, no earlier than June 1589, released as part of a prisoner exchange.\n\nIn the 1590s, Captain Wingfield was garrisoned at Drogheda, Ireland – where commanders reported for pay, rations and munitions to the Clerk of the Cheque & Muster-Master, Colonel Sir Ralph Lane, the former Deputy Governor of Sir Walter Ralegh's ill-fated 1584–86 Roanoke Colony (in modern-day North Carolina). Lane was Wingfield's father's old neighbour in Orlingbury, near Kimbolton.\n\nIn 1593, Wingfield was a member of parliament for Chippenham, Wiltshire, one of five Wingfield family MPs – a seat obtained for him by his neighbour, Anthony Mildmay of Apethorpe, probably encouraged by Wingfield's cousin, Sir Robert Cecil. He may have sat on a committee considering cloth in March, but this (and parliament) he decided was not for him, and he returned shortly afterward to the soldier's life at the Dundalk Garrison in Ireland.\n\nWingfield was a Feoffee, or Governor, of Kimbolton School in 1600 – which riled his old fellow-colonist from 1569 in Ireland, Sir John Popham, a keen promoter of Virginia; and indeed they clashed over getting their own men onto the school's Board of Governors. Popham had just banished Sir Edward to County Galway for life, for the part he had played in the Revolt of the Earl of Essex in 1599, doubtless telling him that this would prevent his being executed, and sequestered Kimbolton Castle, sending his family to their London house at St. Andrew's, Holborn. Despite his pleas, Queen Elizabeth I never permitted Sir Edward to return home.\n\nAlthough Sir Thomas Gates was later hailed by Sir Edwin Sandys as the \"principle forwarder\" of the London Virginia Company, Captain John Smith wrote in his \"General Historie\" that, when in 1605–06 the Jamestown expedition was making no progress, Wingfield got it moving: \"\"Captain Bartholomew Gosnold (Wingfield's second cousin)\", one of the first movers of this plantation, having many years solicited many friends, but found small assistance; Gosnold at last prevailed with some gentlemen, Capt John Smith, Mr Edward-Maria Wingfield, Mr Reverend Robert Hunt, and diverse others, who depended a year upon his projects, but nothing could be effected, till by their great charge and industry, it came to be apprehended by certain of the Nobility, Gentry and Merchants, so that His Majesty by his letters patents, gave permission for establishing Councils, to direct here; and to govern, and to execute there.\"\"\n\nIt has been posited that Cecil, Hakluyt and others were concerned that they should not have a leader like the Earl of Essex, who might set up his own kingdom in Virginia, and therefore sought out an old retired military man instead. (Bartholomew Gosnold's next brother, Captain Wingfield Gosnold, was not to sail with the expedition). Gosnold (aka \"Gosnell\") may have been \"\"Captain Gosnell\"\" who, in 1604 at a dinner in the Isle of Wight made some \"intemperate\" comment about the King, so perhaps causing important people to shun him. There is no record of Smith (or indeed Hunt) doing anything special, but Gabriel Archer, who was on Gosnold's 1602 \"Cape Cod Expedition\", had in that year been active in recruitment in London.\n\nWingfield was involved in fundraising and was one of the biggest backers of the venture, with family friends, Sir Thomas Gates, Sir William Waad (aka Wade) (Lieutenant-Governor of the Tower of London), Sir Thomas Smythe (Treasurer of the Virginia Company), John Martin, Sr., Sir Oliver Cromwell and Captain John Ratcliffe (aka Sicklemore). Barbour wrote: \"John Smith was unaware, always, of the importance of the lever – the legal and financial backing that got the voyage going.\"\n\nIn 1606, without Wingfield's input through his extensive influential contacts, it is possible that the expedition might never have sailed. In 1605–06 Wingfield and his cousin Bartholomew Gosnold, recruited about 40% of the 105 settlers. Most of the would-be gentlemen settlers were impecunious younger sons without prospects, but more than a dozen gentleman (as Dr. John Horn observes), and Captain John Martin ... \"\"clearly were gentlemen with other motives, perhaps just the adventure in its own right\"\".\n\nWingfield obtained the approval of Richard Bancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury, his old London vicar at St. Andrew's, Holborn, for the Reverend Robert Hunt of Old Heathfield (who was in disgrace from his arrival there in 1602 for immorality with his servant, Thomasina Plumber, and for absenteeism and thereby neglect of his congregation). This recruitment may have been with the help of Richard Hakluyt, Jr., who was also due to sail, or maybe he was volunteered by Wingfield's cousin-by-marriage the 3rd Lord De La Warr, the future Governor-General of Jamestown; and Hunt had his will witnessed by a Tristram Sicklemore, so may have already known John Sicklemore aka Ratcliffe. The Archbishop's approval was dated as late as 24 November 1606 – yet, sadly, at the very last moment Hakluyt, the senior of the two priests, backed out.\n\nDespite the fact Sir Thomas Howard (Lord Southampton's brother-in-law) and Baron Arundell, both Roman Catholics, as well as Sir Ferdinando Gorges, had funded the spring 1605 expedition to Allen's Island (in present-day Newfoundland), designed to establish a colony for British Catholicism, there is absolutely no way that Wingfield or indeed Hunt (described by Wingfield as \"\"a man not in any way to be touched with the rebellious humours of a popish spirit, nor blemished with the least suspicion of a factious schismatic, whereof I had a special care\"\"), could have had Catholic or Non-conformist leanings, the more so in the wake of the previous year's Catholic Gunpowder Plot. All would-be colonists had to subscribe to the Oath of Allegiance and the Oath of Supremacy of 1559, which denied the doctrine of the Pope's authority, in both deposing rulers and in absolving Englishmen from their allegiance. Indeed the latter oath debarred Roman Catholics from participation in Anglo-American colonisation – until George Calvert, a Catholic convert, founded Maryland for persecuted Roman Catholics and Puritans in 1634.\n\nThe 1606 Charter. On 10 April 1606, Wingfield was one of eight \"incorporators\" of the Virginia Company, who \"\"prayed His Majesty to incorporate them, and to enable them to raise a joint stake\"\". Divided into two missions, four men sub-incorporated as the Virginia Company of London and four as the Virginia Company of Plymouth, which would attempt to found a colony at Kennebec River. The four for the London (Jamestown) Company, besides Wingfield, being Richard Hakluyt, Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George Somers – (i.e. these suitors ensured the legality of the Company). They prayed His Majesty to incorporate them, and to enable them to raise a joint stake.\n\nThe Charter stated: \"\"James, by the grace of God, King of England ... Whereas our loving and well disposed subjects, Sir Thomas Gates, and Sir George Somers, Knights, Richard Hackluit, Clerk...and Edward Maria Wingfield, Esq... have been humble suitors unto us, that we would vouchsafe unto them and may in time bring the infidels and savages in those parts, to human civility, and to a settled and quiet government, Do, by these our letters patent, graciously accept of, & agree to, their humble and well intended desires...and do therefore, for Us, our heirs and successors, Grant and agree, that the said Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Somers, Richard Hackluit, [sic] and Edward Maria Wingfield, adventurers of and for our city of London... shall and may begin their said first plantation...and seat of their first abode & habitation ... Richard Hakluyt, Edward Maria Wingfield, [etc.]: Adventurers... of and for our City of London, and such others as are or shall be joined unto them of that Colony... shall and may begin their said first Plantation and Seat of that first Abode and Habitation, at any place upon the said coast of Virginia, where they shall think fit and convenient between the said four and thirty and one and forty [34–41] degrees of the said Latitude...\"\"\n\nHe and his fellow incorporators were licensed by King James I to \"\"make habitation, plantation and to deduce a colony in that part of America \"commonly called Virginia, and other parts and territories not actually possessed by any Christian prince or people, between 34 and 45 degrees North and \"shall and may inhabit and remain there, and shall build and fortify [there] ... \"according to their best discretion\" ... \"and shall and lawfully may ... dig, mine and search for all manner of mines ... yielding to us ... the fifth part only of all the same gold and silver and the fifteenth part of all the same copper... and they shall or fully may establish and cause to be made a coin, to pass current there between people... with sufficient shipping, and furniture of armour, weapons, ordnance, powder, victuals\"\" etc...\nThe Charter went on to say: that Wingfield, Hakluyt, Gates and Somers could \"\"encounter, repulse or repel and resist\"\" all persons attempting to inhabit the said colonies \"\"without especial licence\"\" and that anyone they caught \"trafficking\" i.e. trading, should pay \"\"five of every hundred of such wares\"\". Anyone robbing or spoiling was to make restitution. Everything was to be in effect for 25 years before reverting to the Crown and all land was to be held of the Crown.\n\nWingfield apparently took a copy of the 1st Virginia Charter with him to Virginia, something that would have been provocative to a man like Gabriel Archer. Two days before he sailed – which was about the time that his Bible was stolen – he made over his estate at Stonely to seven friends and neighbours (including two Pophams and Hakluyt's friend and Wingfield's neighbour, Pickering) and five relations (including four Wingfields). For the southern colony (Jamestown) Wingfield was the only \"adventurer\" (one risking his means) and \"venturer\" (one risking his life) to sail. The four patentees for each of the two colonies (Jamestown, and Sagadahoc – in modern-day Maine) had, as stated above, \"\"licence to make habitation, plantation and to deduce a colony.\"\" The two colonies were to be controlled by the King's Council of Virginia – which included not only the indomitable Sir Thomas Smythe, but also Wingfield's old comrade-in-arms and fellow Prisoner of War (for 18 months in 1588–1589) in Spanish captivity, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, and Wingfield's cousin-by-marriage, Lord de la Warr. \n\nThree little ships, the Susan Constant, the Discovery and the Godspeed sailed from Blackwall Dock, London under the overall command of Captain Christopher Newport on 19 December 1606 to found Jamestown; and \"\"the fleet fell from London\"\" on 20 December.\n\nThe Council of Virginia had decreed on 10 September 1606 that Newport was commissioned and given by the Council \"\"with the sole charge and command of all the captains and soldiers, and mariners, and other persons, that shall go in any of the said ships and pinnace in the said voyage from the day of the date hereof\" [i.e. 13 weeks prior to settling at Jamestown] \"until such time as they shall fortune 'to land' upon the said coast of Virginia.\"\" Newport, \"\"was hired only for our transportation\"\" (wrote Smith). From 26 April 1607 everyone knew who was a councillor, but not who was President – and knew that the first British presidential election was not to be before they had found \"and landed\" at a good site to settle. This was not a propitious beginning, and likely caused friction between the Councillors as they \"jostled\" to obtain votes. \n\nOn 26 April 1607. \"\"...the first land they made, they called Cape Henry\"\" for Prince Henry, the young heir to the throne. Here Newport and Wingfied likely would have made a formal Declaration claiming Virginia for the Crown. That night the box was opened and the orders [dated 20 November 1606] read out. Wingfield [et al.] were to be on the Council and were to elect a President for a year from their number. \n\n\"\"Until 13 May they sought a place to plant in, then the Council was sworn, and Mr. Wingfield was chosen President, and an Oration made...\"\" – by him, probably immediately after being sworn in. This was the first-ever democratic election in the New World.\n\nAt 57 Wingfield was about double the age of some of the Council. He had successfully petitioned the King for the Charter, was a \"\"captain of success\"\" in defence-works and skirmishing (patrolling) and was one of the expedition's main stockholders. Thus, he was the obvious choice for President. However, the line of Command and Control and of \"\"Land and Sea Force Cooperation\"\" was problematic, since the President was not to command the mariners (as Sir Richard Grenville had at Roanoke), and the handover details were \"\"woolly\"\".\n\nThe Council in London had advised the settlers \"\"to sit \"(set)\" down\"\" possibly \"\"on some island that is strong by nature... and not overburthened with woods... so far up as a bark\" (barque)\" of 50 tons will float ... perchance .. a hundred miles from the river's mouth\" \"with no native people to inhabit between you and the sea coast\".\" Probably the key factor which swayed Wingfield into selecting Jamestown, was Ralph Lane's error at Roanoke in 1584, having the ships a mile from their camp – and, as an experienced soldier not wanting to split his force, therefore kept his heaviest ship with them. So, on 12 May, Wingfield vetoed Archer's Hope, the first site proposed, as too visible (thus easily bombarded by foreign ships' guns). At Jamestown, the ships could be secured to the overhanging trees – even the 120-ton Susan Constant. That Wingfield (who as a \"suitor\" was instructed by the King to site their \"\"abode and habitation... and to begin their ...first plantation\"\" at any place he thought \"\"fit and convenient\"\") succeeded in rejecting Archer's Hope (i.e. haven), and selected the present Jamestown site (some upriver), showed that he was a tough character.\n\nSmall in number, the colonists had to decide whether to concentrate their defences against either sea attack by the French and Spanish, or against possible assault from native tribes in the area. Archer's Hope would have been better for firing down on approaching Spanish ships (i.e. large targets), since it was higher than Wingfield's river-level island/isthmus site at Jamestown. But for warding off land or canoe attacks by the \"naturals\", Jamestown's low field of fire was more easily defended with infantry. Wingfield was a soldier experienced in warding off Spanish foot soldiers and Irish guerrillas in dyke or swampland. Since the Councillors were not yet sworn, after two weeks of everyone arguing the pros and cons of different sites, a decision had to be made before they developed into a rabble. Furthermore, only the Kecoughtan tribe lay between them and the coast, whereas if he had sited the settlement upstream, five further tribes would have cut them off from escape. Jamestown was described by Smith as \"\"a very great place for the erecting of a great city\"\" and by Hamor as \"\"a good and fertile island\"\". \n\nDuring his Presidency Wingfield had the James Fort constructed in a month and a day. Barbour claimed he had no proven military service – which is nonsense, since his long service in the military in Ireland and up to fifteen years in the Low Countries is listed in the Calendar of State Papers. Since of the dozen or so captains he was by far the most experienced soldier in defence-works and defensive warfare, Wingfield supervised the construction of the fort (140 yards by by plus three artillery \"blisters\" of each) – involving the felling of perhaps 500–600 30 ft-trees, cutting them in half and burying one end firmly in the ground: a vast task. During construction, George Kendall supervised a temporary defence-work of the felled \"\"half-moon of trees and brushwood... the boughs of trees cast together\"\" as cover, prior to the ends of the huge triangular palisade being \"joined up\", as was normal military practice. \"\"Newport and Smith and twenty others were sent to discover the head of the river\"\", wrote Smith (rather than \"\"Newport decided to go exploring\"\" – as so many books would have it). President Wingfield was now in charge, but before long his cousin Gosnold warned him that he was driving the men too hard, ever holding them to \"\"working, watching, and warding.\"\"\n\n27 May 1607: Belying Smith's statement that the weapons were kept boxed or casked, President Wingfield successfully repulsed a fierce, hour-long attack on Jamestown, leading from the front. Outnumbered 3:1 – with but 130 men and boys – he drove off 400 native warriors. \"\"... And our President, Mr Wynckfeild (who showed himself a valiant Gentleman), had one shot clean through his beard, yet 'scaped hurt\"\" [escaped being injured], wrote Archer. Percy also called Wingfield \"\"a true, valiant gentleman\"\".\n\nThe First Holy Communion at Jamestown, 22 June 1607 (as depicted in Old Heathfield Church, Sussex, England).\n\nPresident Wingfield built the great fort, sowed the first crops, imposed strict rationing – planned \"\"for the long time until our harvest would be ripe\"\" (wrote Wingfield), – and \"\"every meal of fish or flesh should excuse \"[e.g. would cancel out] \"the allowance for porridge\"\". He got in three weeks' reserve supplies through bartering for food with \"the Naturals\", while (as ordered by the Council in London) \"\"not offending them\"\". He had to impose a strict rationing: \"\"half a pint of wheat and as much barley boiled with water for a man a day, having fried 26 weeks in the ships hold, contained as many worms as grains\"\".\n\nIn the oppressive heat, the diminishing food-stocks and American Indian attacks soon brought disease, death and dissension. President Wingfield and his settlers would not learn that their founding of Jamestown was during the worst seven-year dry spell (1606–1612) in nearly 800 years – which \"\"dried up fresh-water supplies and devastated corn crops\"\". Dr William Kelso and Beverly Straube of Jamestown Rediscovery are convinced that the colony's fate was \"\"beyond the control of either settlers or their London backers\"\". But the settlers were tough. The hardy ones survived that period and won through, establishing, as Dr. James Horn points out, \"\"four fundamental characteristics of British America: representative government, private property, civilian control of the military, and a Protestant church\"\"; along with English language and customs.\n\nOn 10 September 1607, amid starvation and attacks from native tribes, Wingfield was arrested and deposed from his presidency. The now ex-President was arraigned on the following charges (just as in 1609 the 4th Governor/President Percy – with ex-President (the 2nd) Ratcliffe, Archer and Martin – was to send the ex-President Smith (the 3rd president) home to answer eight similar, more serious charges):\n\n(1) Calling Smith a liar.\n\n(2) Accusing Smith of concealing a mutiny plotted and confessed by Galthrop or Calthorpe, Gent.\n\n(3) Denying Martin a spoonful of beer. Starving Martin's son to death. \n\n(4) Accusing Smith's old comrade-in-arms from Transylvania, \"Jehu Robinson, Gentleman\" and others of \"\"consenting to run away with the shallop\"\" to Newfoundland (as it was later called).\n\n(5) Starving the colony. [It was \"suggested\" that he had had food buried in the ground. Indeed he had, but this was then the normal way to keep food and drink (in casks or vats) from going bad in hot weather, and besides, it did stop rations from being stolen. The future Secretary, William Strachey was to write of such \"underground storehouses\", and indeed such food and drink storage methods were then in use in England and indeed were still in use in England and America until well into the 20th century.\n\n(6) \"\"Banquet and riot, in that he did feed himself and his servants out to the common store.\"\"\n\nIn Wingfield's time everyone was fed out of the common store, although there may have been separate Mess areas for the Council, the Gentlemen and labourers. Clearly, if this charge were true, it would have been made to stick. \"\"Mr. Smith, in the time of our hunger\"\", wrote Edward Maria, \"\"had spread a rumour in the colony that I did feast my servants out of the common store, with intent, as I gathered, to have stirred the discontented company against me\"\". No other writer of this period even implies that the President was requisitioning extra rations for himself or his servants. Wingfield started bartering with the Indians and/or stocked up with shot game, \"\"for, as his store increased, he mended the common pot: he had laid up besides, provision for 3 weeks' wheat beforehand...I was all for one and one to all.\"\" Since Newport's return was a long way off, Edward Maria had imposed fair, very strict – and naturally very unpopular – rationing on the settlers.\n\n(7) \"\"That I combined with the Spaniards to the destruction of the colony\"\".\n\n(8) \"\"That I am an atheist, because I carried not a bible, and because I forbid the preacher to preach\"\". Why was President Wingfield accused of being an atheist? Because (a) he had no bible with him, (b) he cancelled two – or three – sermons, and (c) after he had been deposed, he failed to attend church on one or two occasions. [(a) His bible was stolen at Croft's house, just before they sailed from Blackwall. (b) When the men returned from standing to arms or counter-attacks, it was too late to have the sermon – and sermons were long in those days: so he cancelled them: \"\"On two or three Sunday mornings, the Indians gave us alarums at our town\"\", wrote Wingfield... \"\"by that times they were answered, the place about us well discovered, and our divine service ended, the day was far spent.\"\" (c) And after his arrest (when he was sick and lame), he did not attend on a further one or two occasions when it was raining].\n\n(9) \"\"That I affected a kingdom\"\".\n\n(10) \"\"That I did hide the common provision in the ground\"\".\n\nAn additional \"charge\" is suggested by Smith's biographer, Philip L. Barbour: \"\"that Wingfield was implicated in the planned escape in the pinnace to Spain (not England) by Kendall\"\". He wrote that Kendall began whispering about abandoning the colony – \"\"perhaps with the connivance of Wingfield...and Wingfield seemed implicated\"\" etc. His primary source presumably was Thomas Studley (or, rather, Smith – see note below), who in June 1608 wrote: \"\"Wingfield and Kendall, living in disgrace... strengthened themselves with the sailors and confederates to regain their former credit and authority, or at least such means aboard the pinnace.. to alter her course, and to go for England... Smith...forced them to stay or sink in the river. Which action cost the life of Kendall\" [who was shot after trial]\".\n\nSmith further wrote: \"\"The President\" [Ratcliffe aka Sicklemore] and Captain Archer, not long after, intended also, to have abandoned the country\".\n\nWingfield, however, was not charged with desertion – or he too would surely have been shot. It would seem that Smith got confused, accidentally or deliberately, over the dates of two or three different incidents. Indeed in 1608 Smith had also written: \"\"Our store being now indifferently well provided with corn\" [e.g. maize]\" there was much ado for to have the pinnace go to England, against which Captain Martin and myself stood chiefly against it: and in fine after many debatings pro et contra, it was resolved to stay a further resolution.\"\" Some time after Kendall was shot, Wingfield came ashore from the pinnace and stated to Smith and Archer that: \"\"I was determined to go to England to acquaint our Council of our weaknesses ... I said further, I desired not to go into England, if either Mr. President\" [Ratcliffe aka Sicklemore]\" would go.\"\"\n\nThe President by then was Ratcliffe. Barbour, who wrote of \"\"John Smith's usual exaggeration\"\", describes \"\"the superlative pettiness\"\" of the charges against Wingfield...\"\"none of the accusations against him amounted to anything – not even Archer's assertion that he was in league with the Spaniards to destroy the colony.\"\" When the pragmatic Captain Newport, 47, arrived with the First Supply, he found young Smith, 27 – having been charged with losing two men to the Indians – also under restraint – for the second time; and he was, also for the second time since the expedition had set out, due to be hanged (on the morrow). Newport released Wingfield and Smith, waiving all but one of the charges against them both as petty, but he did not reinstate Wingfield, as the charge of being an atheist was so serious that he would have to be sent to England to be tried for it – just as Smith was to be later.\n\nThe disgruntled settlers now thought that the 2nd President, John Ratcliffe, was the source of all their problems, and Smith, Kendall and Percy planned to send James Read the blacksmith on a maintenance visit to the pinnace, where Wingfield was held, to see if Wingfield would agree to be reinstated, but Ratcliffe learned of these plans and had Read publicly thrashed.\n\nIn his \"Discourse of Virginia\" (1608), Wingfield comes across as a tough old soldier – too tough with the men, and too old for the job. He \"\"could not make ropes of sand\"\" as Stephen Vincent Benet described his situation\n\nUp to the 1980s, Wingfield's reputation as a villain stems from his chief rival, John Smith, who was apparently prone to supreme exaggeration. Newly freed from arrest, Smith wrote of Wingfield's \"\"overweening jealousy\"\" i.e. supremely self-confident and suspicious of rivalry – which one could argue are two necessary qualities required by a commander. Command is lonely and doubtless the \"\"cliqueyness\"\" of the \"\"Cape Cod Crew of 1602\"\" (Gosnold, Martin and Archer), the Middle Temple lawyers (Gosnold and Percy) and the \"\"generation gap\"\" problem between Wingfield aged 57 vis-a-vis Smith aged 27 (and many men in their 20s and 30s), did not help. Smith also described Wingfield and probably Percy and Newport as \"\"tufftaffety humorists\"\" i.e. overdressed, full of humour and laughter but liable to mood swings. Smith's views of President Wingfield were repeated by John Oldmixon in 1708, then further downgraded by the author of his entry in the (British) Dictionary of Biography of 1880, and more so by Barbour (1964), Smith's biographer. Barbour was obsessively anti-Wingfield, describing him as an aristocrat (i.e. a baron, marquess, viscount, earl or duke), which Wingfield was not, nor before 1618 had any member of his family ever been (although his grandfather was awarded the Knight of the Garter, for his work as an ambassador); and (b) as having three servants at Jamestown; but Smith was no farmer's lad. Smith too was a Captain, had three servants at Jamestown, possessed a coat of arms, owned property (in Louth, Lincolnshire), had a well-to-do tenant farmer father; and was, moreover, raised with the younger Bertie children and was given a personal equestrian course by the Henry, 2nd Earl of Lincoln, of Tattershall Castle.\n\nIn 1608, King James \"induced\" the Lord Mayor, Sir Humphrey Weld, \"a member of the Grocer's Company\", to issue a Precept about corporate funding for Jamestown. In the 2 or 3 charges not considered ludicrous by the level-headed Newport, Wingfield defended himself successfully before Archbishop Bancroft in London.\n\nStill involved with the Virginia Company at 70, he was still involved in the affairs of the colony a dozen years later, e.g. the \"Declaration of Supplies\" intended to be sent to Virginia in 1620, 22 June has: \"\"Winckfield, Edward Maria, Captain, Esquire, Adventurer of the Virginia Company, London (Eng.): -L-88.\"\". He was buried at St. Andrew's, Kimbolton on 13 April 1631.\n\n\"\"The Founder of an institution, organisation or idea, etc.\"\" is defined in Collins, Cobuild as: \"a person who sets it up or causes it to be built, perhaps by providing the necessary money.\" Edward Maria Wingfield qualifies for Founder of Jamestown on all three counts. He was an incorporator of the 1st Virginia Charter, contributed the huge sum of -L-88 [=$15,000 today], one of the very largest investments, was the only adventurer to sail to Jamestown (as cited) and, as the elected first President, built James Fort – described by John Smith as \"a very great place for the erecting of a great city\".\" – President Wingfield's memorial at Jamestown Church. \n\n\nA. Virginia Company Records. Since the Court (or Minute) Book for the Virginia Company for 28 January 1606 to 14 February 1615 disappeared after 1623(3) the only reliable (and likely incomplete) source is Alexander Brown's \"The Genesis of the United States\" [Vol. 2, 1899] – under the various family or individuals' names.\n\nB. Wingfield's \"\"A Discourse of Virginia\"\" (\"...upon the truth of this journal [I] do pledge my faith, and life...\") is, incredibly, not drawn on as source material in four recent books on Jamestown [Lambeth Palace Library MS 250, ff.382r–392v; British Library 9602e 8, including an 1860 copy edited by Charles Deane with Introduction and Notes, 26 pages]. The first published version was only seen by a few people (through private subscription); and so the first time Wingfield's account was seen by a larger public – in New York and Glasgow – was not until 1905–1906, in Purchas, \"His Pilgrimes, vol. XVIII\". (To convert the page numbers of Wingfield's Discourse to its page number in Jocelyn R. Wingfield's \"Virginia's True Founder\", add 298).\n\nC. Wingfield's biography by Jocelyn R.

{"id": "2173291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173291", "title": "Inetd", "text": "Inetd\n\ninetd (internet service daemon) is a super-server daemon on many Unix systems that provides Internet services. For each configured service, it listens for requests from connecting clients. Requests are served by spawning a process which runs the appropriate executable, but simple services such as \"echo\" are served by inetd itself. External executables, which are run on request, can be single- or multi-threaded. First appearing in 4.3BSD, it is generally located at codice_1.\n\nOften called a super-server, inetd listens on designated ports used by Internet services such as FTP, POP3, and telnet. When a TCP packet or UDP packet arrives with a particular destination port number, inetd launches the appropriate server program to handle the connection. For services that are not expected to run with high loads, this method uses memory more efficiently, since the specific servers run only when needed. Furthermore, no network code is required in the service-specific programs, as inetd hooks the sockets directly to stdin, stdout and stderr of the spawned process. For protocols that have frequent traffic, such as HTTP and POP3, a dedicated server that intercepts the traffic directly may be preferable.\n\nThe list of services that will be serviced is given in a configuration file, usually codice_2. A GUI for managing the configuration file is an optional accessory. The daemon may need a signal in order to re-read its configuration. For an example, telnet can be configured as follows (line taken from a machine running AIX version 5.1):\n\nThe first word, codice_3, is the official name of the service. It is resolved using the system database to map port numbers and protocols to service names. In this case, codice_4 should contain:\n\nThe second and third words describe the type of socket and underlying protocol respectively. The codice_5 database is consulted.\n\nThe fourth word is the wait/nowait switch. A single-threaded server expects inetd to wait until it finishes reading all the data. Otherwise inetd lets the server run and spawns new, concurrent processes for new requests.\n\nThe fifth word is the user name, from the codice_6 database, that the service program should run as.\n\nFinally, the path and the arguments of an external program are given. As usual, the first argument is the program name. In the example, inetd is told to launch the program codice_7 with the command line arguments codice_8. inetd automatically hooks the socket to stdin, stdout, and stderr of the server program.\n\nGenerally TCP sockets are handled by spawning a separate server to handle each connection concurrently. UDP sockets are generally handled by a single server instance that handles all packets on that port.\n\nSome simple services, such as echo, are handled directly by inetd, without spawning an external server.\n\nThis is a simple inetd service, written in C. It expects a command line argument containing a filename for a log file, and then it logs all strings sent through the socket to the log file. Note that this is a very insecure example program.\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv)\n\nThe example uses stdio functions and it responds to network traffic coming in on stdin. In this case, we want all messages logged to a single file, so we only want one instance of the service running to service all requests. This means UDP is the correct protocol to use. First, an unused port number must be selected. In this sample, 9999 will be used. The codice_4 entry will look like this:\n\nAnd the entry in codice_2 will look like this:\n\nThis tells inetd to run the codice_11 program, with the commandline: codice_12 (refer to the inetd.conf man page for information on the other arguments). The first argument contains the filename to be used for the log file: codice_13. inetd will run the service when needed, and attach port 9999 to the input and output streams, and all strings sent to that port will be logged to the file. By specifying wait, it tells inetd to only use one instance of the server to handle all requests.\n\nNote: the functionality of the above example is usually implemented by using syslog and a process like syslogd. syslogd would normally be started in parallel with inetd, not as an inetd service.\n\nIn recent years, because of the security limitations in the original design of inetd, it has been replaced by xinetd, rlinetd, ucspi-tcp, and others in many systems. Distributions of Linux especially have many options and Mac OS X (beginning with Mac OS X v10.2) uses xinetd. As of version Mac OS X v10.4, Apple has merged the functionality of inetd into launchd.\n\nThe services provided by inetd can be omitted entirely. This is becoming more common where machines are dedicated to a single function. For example, an HTTP server could be configured to just run httpd and have no other ports open. A dedicated firewall could have no services started.\n\nsystemd supports inetd services, and expands socket activation beyond IP messaging (AF INET+6) to include AF UNIX, AF NETLINK and more.\n\nWhile the inetd concept as a service dispatcher is not inherently insecure, the long list of services that inetd traditionally provided gave computer security experts pause. The possibility of a service having an exploitable flaw, or the service just being abused, had to be considered. Unnecessary services being disabled and \"off by default\" became the mantra. It is not uncommon to find an codice_2 with almost all the services commented out in a modern Unix distribution.\n\n"}
{"id": "2173295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173295", "title": "Cool (Gwen Stefani song)", "text": "Cool (Gwen Stefani song)\n\n\"Cool\" is a song by American singer Gwen Stefani from her debut solo studio album, \"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\" (2004). Written by Stefani and Dallas Austin, the song was released on July 5, 2005 as the album's fourth single. It was written by Austin basing the song on No Doubt's \"Simple Kind of Life\", but he did not finish it. He then asked for help from Stefani, and they finished the song in 15 minutes. The single's musical style and production were inspired by synth-pop and new wave arrangements from the 1980s, and its lyrics chronicle a relationship in which two lovers have separated, but remain \"cool\" with each other as good friends.\n\nThe song received generally positive reviews from music critics, being compared to Cyndi Lauper and Madonna songs from the 1980s. The media have drawn parallels between the song's lyrical content and the romantic relationship that Stefani had with Tony Kanal, a fellow group member of No Doubt. The song was moderately successful on the charts, reaching the top 10 in Australia, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and New Zealand, as well as the top 20 in Denmark, Ireland, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nThe accompanying music video was filmed by British director Sophie Muller in Lake Como, Italy. It features many flashbacks to when Stefani and her former boyfriend were dating, and currently, both are fine with their friendship. The song was included on the setlist for Stefani's debut tour Harajuku Lovers Tour and the tour's video album, as well as in the 2006 comedies, \"Last Holiday\" and \"Click\" and the 2010 drama film \"Somewhere\".\n\n\"Cool\" was originally written by Dallas Austin after listening to Stefani's group No Doubt's song \"Underneath It All\" (2002). Austin commented that he was trying to write his version of No Doubt's \"Simple Kind of Life\", but he was unable to finish the song. He later asked Stefani if she wanted to co-write lyrics. During a studio session together, they finished \"Cool\" in 15 minutes. Stefani commented, \"When he told me about the track and where it came from for him, it just triggered something in me.\" The lyrics of \"Cool\" reflect Stefani's former relationship with No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal. Although their romantic relationship ended, the lyrics portray Stefani's attitude that it is \"cool\" that they still remain very good friends. Stefani and Kanal's relationship had provided the inspiration for No Doubt's \"Don't Speak\" (1996), and while \"Cool\" presents an amicable friendship between former lovers, \"Don't Speak\" is about a failing relationship and never arrives at a solution for the couple. Stefani said that she had never intended to include \"personal\" material on \"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\", and commented, \"but no matter what you do, things just come out. It just ended this whole thing for me in my head, and it puts an end to a chapter in a really nice way.\" The lyrics of \"Cool\" sum up the evolution of their relationship with the line \"After all that we've been through, I know we're cool\".\n\"Cool\" is a mid-tempo love song featuring a synth-pop and new wave production. The song is composed in D major. It is written in common time, it moves at a moderate tempo of 112 beats per minute, and it has a vocal range from the low note of F♯ to the high note of C♯. The song is written in the common verse-chorus form, featuring five instruments: bass guitar, drums, guitar, keyboards, and synthesizer. \"Cool\" opens with all five instruments, and as Stefani begins singing, the synthesizer is lowered, and the hard-hitting drum beat steadily increases in volume. She performs her highest pitch (C♯) during the chorus, after which she sings in a softer, almost \"sotto voce\", and her lowest pitch (E) at the beginning of the verses. The synthesizer emulates brass and woodwind instruments, while the bass and guitar retain a prominent and regular eighth note pulse, using a I–IV–V chord progression for the verses. In the percussion section a drum kit is used, and the snare is introduced at the beginning of the first chorus, which maintains its beat. During the song's fade-out, Stefani repeats \"I know we're cool\" and \"yeah\", and she occasionally emphasizes \"cool\". Her vocal range covers close to two octaves. In April 2020 Austin revealed the song was originally written for Christina Aguilera.\n\n\"Cool\" received acclaim from music critics. Yahoo! Music's Jennifer Nine referred to the song as \"a liltingly sweet paean to post-break-up friendships\", while Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called it a \"high school anthem-in-waiting\" theme; it also was selected as one of the album's highlights. Richard Smirke of Playlouder commented that the song successfully used the same production formula as fellow album tracks \"Serious\" and \"What You Waiting For?\", and described it as a \"crisp blend of edgy 21C production and early 80s Madonna-esque pop\". Jason Damas, in a review for PopMatters, characterized it as \"a slippery slice of keyboard\" New Wave song referring to it as a \"pitched halfway between The Go-Go's and Cyndi Lauper\". \n\nEric Greenwood for Drawer B called \"Cool\" \"a retrofitted [song] with stale synths and chugging guitars\" with \"dorkier lyrics than even Cyndi Lauper would dare\". Sandy Cohen from the \"Toronto Star\" called it \"the year's love anthem\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" reviewer David Browne described Stefani, in \"Cool\" and in another song (\"The Real Thing\"), as \"a glacial '80s synthpop zombie\". Krissi Murison from \"NME\" found Stefani's performance reminiscent of \"Madonna's breathless purr\". John Murphy wrote for musicOMH that \"Cool\" would remind No Doubt fans of \"Don't Speak\". \"Blender\" magazine editors ranked \"Cool\" at number 45 on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Songs of 2005\".\n\nIn the United States, the song debuted at number 86 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on the issue dated July 16, 2005. The next week it rose to number 64, and it reached its peak position of number 13 on September 3, 2005. On other \"Billboard\" charts, the single topped the Hot Dance Club Play, reached number four on the Adult Top 40 and number nine on the Pop 100. In Australia it debuted and peaked at number 10 on September 11, 2005, dropping off the chart on November 13, 2005 at number 49. In New Zealand \"Cool\" became the second highest debut of the week ending September 5, 2005, at number 11. It rose to its peak position of number nine the following week, becoming her fifth consecutive top 10 in the country.\n\nIn European countries the song performed moderately, reaching the top 40 in most of them. It reached number 26 on the European Hot 100 Singles on October 8, 2005. On the Czech Airplay Chart, \"Cool\" entered the chart number 12, achieving its peak position of number 10 in its 10th week. In Italy, it debuted at number 16 on September 22, 2005, peaking at number 15 the week after. The single debuted at number 18 on the Norwegian chart, climbing to number 16 the following week. \"Cool\" debuted and peaked at number 12 on the Irish Singles Chart during the week ending September 1, 2005. In the United Kingdom the single debuted and peaked at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart for the week of September 4, 2005, spending 10 weeks on the chart. In Austria \"Cool\" debuted at number 31 on September 11, 2005. Four weeks later, the song reached its peak position of number 15, and was last seen on December 16, 2005, after 15 weeks.\n\nThe song's music video was directed by Sophie Muller and filmed in Lake Como, Italy. \"It was obvious I was gonna ask her to do it\", Stefani stated in an interview with VH1's \"Box Set\". The video follows the song's theme and depicts the relationship that Stefani has with a former boyfriend, who is played by Spanish actor Daniel González. González and his new girlfriend—played by Tony Kanal's girlfriend, Erin Lokitz—are shown walking up to a villa where Stefani answers the door. The villa featured in the video is the Villa Erba, in the town of Cernobbio, which Stefani said was \"so beautiful\". The three of them are seen in each other's company, with intercut scenes of Stefani singing on a bed. There are flashbacks to the time when Stefani and her former boyfriend were dating, where she has brunette hair. Flashbacks and present day images are linked with match cut cinematography. The lyrical theme of \"Cool\" is maintained in the video; frames are incorporated to portray Stefani feeling \"cool\". She is depicted as cool with her former boyfriend and his girlfriend throughout most of the video.\n\nThe music video for \"Cool\" premiered on MTV's top-10 chart program \"Total Request Live\" on June 30, 2005, where it reached number three. After its July 8, 2005 debut on MuchMusic's \"Countdown\", it reached number one for the week of October 8, 2005.\n\nIn mid-October 2005, \"Cool\" was included in the setlist for Stefani's first concert tour, Harajuku Lovers Tour, performed as the 11th song of the show. The song was added to the tour's video album \"Harajuku Lovers Live\", released on December 5, 2005. It was also briefly used in the 2006 movies, \"Click\" and \"Last Holiday\". Sofia Coppola's 2010 drama film \"Somewhere\", features Elle Fanning's character Cleo performing an ice dancing routine to the song.\n\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Love. Angel. Music.

Designed for passenger traffic only, the Chinese government built the line to accommodate trains traveling at a maximum speed of , and currently carries CRH high-speed trains running speeds up to .\n\nWhen the line opened on August 1, 2008, it set the record for the fastest conventional train service in the world by top speed, and reduced travel time between the two largest cities in northern China from 70 to 30 minutes. A second phase of construction extended this line from Tianjin to Yujiapu railway station in the Binhai New Area was opened on September 20, 2015.\n\nThe line is projected to approach operating capacity in the first half of 2016. Anticipating this, a second parallel line, the Beijing–Binhai intercity railway, commenced construction on December 29, 2015. It will run from Beijing Sub-Center railway station to Binhai railway station via Baodi and Tianjin Binhai International Airport, along a new route to the northeast of the Beijing–Tianjin ICR. (The line use the same track as Beijing-Tangshan intercity railway between Beijing Sub-Center railway station and Baodi.)\n\nFrom Beijing South railway station, the line runs in a southeasterly direction, following the Beijing–Tianjin–Tanggu Expressway to Tianjin. It has three intermediate stations at Yizhuang, Yongle (not yet fully built) and Wuqing. The line currently uses the Jinshan Railway for some extended services to Tanggu. The service has peak speed between cities.\n\nAs an intercity line, it will provide train service only between the two metropolitan areas, unlike the Beijing–Shanghai High-Speed Railway which will continue beyond Shanghai.\n\nThe Beijing–Tianjin intercity railway has a current length of 116.939 km (fare mileage: 120 km), of which roughly 100 km is built on viaducts and the last 17 kilometres on an embankment. The elevated track ensures level tracks over uneven terrain and eliminates the trains having to slow down to safely navigate through at-grade road crossings. \nSometimes known as the Tianjin–Binhai intercity railway, this extension continues southeasterly from Tianjin railway station, following the conventional railway to Tanggu railway station but built on elevated piers with three new stations were to be added. It passes a maintenance depot at Airport West, through Junliangcheng North railway station to Tanggu railway station before entering a tunnel to an underground station, Yujiapu railway station. Junctions have been built along the line allowing services to branch off to a new station under Tianjin Binhai International Airport and to Binhai West railway station on the Tianjin–Qinhuangdao High-Speed Railway. Trial operations of the extension started on August 14, 2015, with official opening on September 20, 2015. the railway reduced travel times from Beijing South station to Yujiapu station to 1 hour 02 minutes and from Tianjin railway station to Yujiapu to 23 minutes.\nThe line opened on August 1, 2008 with 47 daily pairs of intercity trains between Beijing South and Tianjin. Since September 14, 2008, 10 more pairs of trains were added, reducing the minimum interval from 15 minutes to 10 minutes. On September 24, 2008, 4 pairs of trains extended to Tanggu along the conventional railway. On September 28, 2008, 2 more pairs of trains were added into service. Frequencies have consistently been increased since to cope with rising demand. On September 20, 2015, services to Tanggu and Yujiapu transferred on to the parallel high-speed line.\n\nThese intercity trains are designated by the prefixed \"C\" (城) followed by four digits, from C2001 to C2298. Of these, C2001–C2198 are non-stop trains from Beijing South to Tianjin. The odd numbers for trains departing from Beijing South and even numbers for those running to Beijing South. Trains numbered C2201–C2268 are trains from Beijing South and Tianjin that stop on the way at Wuqing and Yizhuang stations. Trains C2271–C2298 run from Beijing South to Tanggu.\n\nIn addition to the intercity service, 13 pairs of trains were diverted to this line from the preexisting Beijing-Shanghai (Jinghu) Railway, including trains from Beijing South to Jinan, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Tianjin West. With the opening of the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway, these trains have been diverted to the new line.\n\nA pair of special track examination trains (numbered DJ01/02) run every day in the morning before any regular trains into service. A track-measuring train (numbered DJ5581/2) runs every ten days. In summary, there are 62 pairs of train in service, 60 of them for passengers. Frequencies are increased over weekends and during major holidays.\n\nFollowing the Wenzhou train crash, maximum speeds were reduced to 300 km/h, with rides taking only three minutes longer than usual. There have been slight drops in fares to accompany the temporary speed limits.\n\nBeginning early 2009, \"Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Concession Card\" frequent rider stored-value cards were introduced for use on this line. Standard Card holders are allowed unreserved seating in the reserved Second Class carriage, Car 6. Gold Card holders are allocated a few reserved seats in Car 5, which is the First Class carriage. To comply with new ticket ID rules effective June 1, 2011, new and upgraded cards are linked to a document of identity.\n\nTrain services running through the Tanggu extension implemented \"commuter\" fares as of June 1, 2017. According to the new scheme, a discount of 5.85% will be applied to trips using the Tanggu extension, making a second class ticket from Tianjin to Yujiapu costing ¥12 and a second class ticket from Beijing to Yujiapu costing ¥54.5. Additional discounts using the \"Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Concession Card\" will also still apply.\n\nThe line is the first railway in China to be built for operational speeds above 300 km/h. This railway line allows speeds up to 350 km/h. A trip between Beijing and Tianjin takes 30 minutes.\n\nBefore mid-2009, the railway used CRH2 trains for service. With effect from mid-2009, only CRH3 trains are used for intercity services on the line. High-speed services to Ji'nan, Qingdao and Shanghai, which used to run on this route, are now diverted to the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway.\n\nThe signaling system is built around Simis W electronic interlockings, Vicos operations control system and ETCS Level 1 train control system.\n\nThe catenary system in use is Sicat HA, aluminum cantilever, powered by two sub-stations at 25 kV 50 Hz AC.\n\nOn June 24, 2008 a Chinese conventional-wheeled train speed record was set on the line when a Siemens Velaro-derived China Railways CRH3 train reached 394.3 km/h.\n\n\nBefore the line was finished, it was expected that the railway line would handle 32 million passengers in 2008 and 54 million passengers in 2015.\n\nThe line opened on August 1, 2008 just before the opening of the 2008 Summer Olympics, which held some football matches in Tianjin. The introduction of high-speed rail service significantly boosted rail travel between the two cities. In 2007, conventional train service between Beijing and Tianjin delivered 8.3 million rides. In the first year of high-speed rail service, from August 2008 to July 2009, total rail passenger volume between Beijing and Tianjin reached 18.7 million, of which 15.85 million rode the Intercity trains. Meanwhile, during the same period, ridership on intercity buses fell by 36.8%. As of September 2010, daily ridership averaged 69,000 or an annual rate of 25.2 million. The line has a capacity of delivering 100 million rides annually and initial estimated repayment period of 16 years.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2013, ridership grew at an annual rate of 20% reaching a cumulative 88 million passengers.\n\nAt the start of construction, an expected ¥12.3 billion (US$1.48 billion) was expected to be invested into the Beijing–Tianjin intercity railway. At the time of construction, the Ministry of Railways and the Tianjian government had each contributed ¥2.6 billion (US$325 million) to the project, while the central government requisitioned land and paid for the resettlement of those affected. However, it would later cost $2.34 billion to build. As of 2010, the line cost ¥1.8 billion per annum to operate, including ¥0.6 billion in interest payments on its ¥10 billion of loan obligations. The terms of the loans range from 5–10 years at interest rates of 6.3 to 6.8 percent. In its first year of operation from August 1, 2008 to July 31, 2009, the line generated ¥1.1 billion in revenues on 18.7 million rides delivered and incurred a loss of ¥0.7 billion. In the second year, ridership rose to 22.3 million and revenues improved to ¥1.4 billion, which narrowed to below ¥0.5 billion. To break even, the line must deliver 30 million rides annually. To be able to repay principal, ridership would need to exceed 40 million. As of 2012, Beijing–Tianjin Intercity Railway officially reported to break even financially, defined as operational costs with debt payments is matched with revenue. By 2015, the line is operating with an operational profit.\n\n\n"}

The series is based on Blizzard Entertainment's \"Warcraft\" universe and follows the adventures of Kalec, a blue dragon who takes the form of a human to investigate a mysterious power, and Anveena, a beautiful young maiden with an enchanting secret.\n\nThe series opens with the history of \"World of Warcraft\". A short introduction into the shaping of the universe up to the events leading to the rise of Arthas as the Lich King.\n\nDuring the unsteady stalemate between the living and undead, a young blue dragon flies over what remains of southern Lordaeron. Kalecgos, the blue dragon, is shot down by Harkyn Grymstone, a dragon hunter driven by hatred towards the dragon who killed his family. Before Harkyn and his party find the wounded dragon, Kalec transforms into a human and is saved by Anveena, a young maiden who saw the event.\n\nBut the hunter's tracking skills and magical items easily led them to the farm of Anveena's parents. Kalec and Anveena try to escape through a tunnel but are spotted by one of Harkyn's henchmen. Kalec returns to his true form and takes to the skies in an attempt to flee together with Anveena, but is hit again and crashes into a lake. The hunter pursue the dragon but the magical artifact steers them North instead of towards the lake.\n\nAnveena finds Kalec again on the shore in human form. After resting they return to Anveena's home. When they see smoke coming from the house they rush over to help but find they are much too late. They suddenly find themselves under attack by undead abominations and ghouls led by Dar'khan, and elven mage and undead commander. Dar'khan surprises them and binds their magics with special neck collars.\n\nDar'khan tells of his betrayal of his fellow High Elves and his search for the Sunwell. Before Dar'khan can harm them, Kalec and Anveena are saved by Tyrygosa, another blue dragon. Tyri had come to protect her future mate.\n\nIn the ruins of her house, Anveena finds a mystic egg. It almost instantly hatches revealing unknown type of dragonhatchling. Anveena senses the hatchling's name is Raac (or because that is what sound it made). In order to remove the binds from Kalec and Anveena all four of them travel to Tarren Mill. Tyri disguises herself as an Elf when they arrive at the town. They search for Borel, an old friend of Anveena's parents, but without luck. The magical bind has overexerted Kalec and they decide to rest at the inn. When Kalec wakes up he finds himself looking down the barrel of Harkyn's gun. Before she can help, Tyri is subdued by a magical net. Anveena escapes hoping to find help and runs into Jorad Mace, a human Paladin. He advises against returning to Tarren Mill because the Dwarven hunter is not the only opponent interested in Anveena and her friends.\n\nThe hunters and their prey suddenly find themselves surrounded by the Scourge. Dar'khan makes his presence known and informed Harkyn he was hired to keep the dragons away. The Lich King foresaw the blue dragons' curiosity about the faint Sunwell energies and had Dar'khan mislead Harkyn into killing any dragon who would come close. Anveena returns before the dragons can be harmed offering to help in exchange for their lives. Dar'khan senses the power of the Sunwell in Raac and offers a trade. When Kalec objects, Dar'khan orders the dragon to be killed. Realizing that he has been tricked, Harkyn takes his gun to Dar'khan instead. While the hunters and Kalec fight Dar'khan and his undead, Jorad frees Tyri who swiftly burns the enemy to cinders. The next morning the entire group decides to head for Aerie Peak in search for Borel and Loggi, a Dwarven smith and a cousin of Harkyn's. Harkyn told them the magical neck-rings looked like Dwarven work, and Loggi might be able to remove them.\n\nIn the next book in the series, it tells of the story of the group's adventures in the Alterac Mountains.\n\nAt first, Tyri is flying Jorad Mace, Kalec, and Anveena to Aerie Peak, where Loggi Grymstone is, but are attacked and grounded by an undead FrostWyrm somewhere in the Alterac Mountains. Anveena comes to in a small room inside a castle, where she meets the global adventurer Trag Highmountain, a Tauren, who helps her recover. Anveena immediately tries to leave to find her comrades, but Trag convinces her to stay after explaining there are Undead in the mountains led by Ichor, an undead commander. She then meets Baron Valimar Mordis, a friend of Trag's, even though the Baron is a rebel Undead. Still, he looks very much like a human besides several scars, including a missing eye. The Baron explains that he was an enemy of Ichor and was trying to find a way to combat him. He then tells his story, explaining he was the lord of a distant kingdom that was ravaged by the undead. He was then raised from death and forced to join the undead ranks. He eventually broke away from them, and Trag, who had previously come to the kingdom as a messenger, found him and helped him recover. After he finishes, he tricks her into giving him some unknown power stored inside her. To do this, he uses an Orb of Ner'zhul, a powerful undead artifact, to use her to raise an army of his own. While being entranced by the Orb, he tells of his true intentions; his goal was to use her all along to raise his army to destroy both the undead and the living, even Trag. He also reveals he controls the Frost Wyrm, not Ichor, and he had planned this the minute they had entered Alterac.\n\nMeanwhile, Kalec finds himself with Raac in a crevasse, so he finds a cave to stay in. Inside the cave, he finds a Dwarven team digging away ice from a giant elephant-like monster. Some dwarves knock him out and bind him, and Trag takes him away to the castle as a prisoner, but promises to secretly help. To try to stop the Baron, Trag disrupts the spell he is casting by telling of a massive army heading his way. After the Baron leaves, Trag wakes Anveena and directs her to Kalec. Later, the Baron learns Trag was lying and attacks him, knocking him out.\n\nWhen Jorad wakes up, he is trapped in a block of ice. Powered by a mysterious voice, he breaks free and then frees Tyri, also trapped. Some undead led by Ichor find them and capture them when they get out of the cave they were in. While taken prisoner, they find Loggi Grymstone in the undead group. He explains that he and some other dwarves came there to obtain resources needed to fight against the undead, but instead found the Baron Mordis, whom they worked for with promises of defeating the undead in Alterac. Tyri and Jorad then tell him why they are in the mountains. While being imprisoned, Loggi signals some other dwarves that the undead are near. The dwarves then counterattack, and are joined by Anveena and Kalec, but the Baron spots them from the castle and sends the FrostWyrm against them. Tyri transforms into a dragon and combats the Wyrm, but the Baron begins his spell, once again entrancing Anveena and raising his new army. The spell is then stopped when Trag overpowers the Baron and stops the spell, which destroys the FrostWyrm. The massive Wyrm skeleton crashes on the castle, presumably killing both of them. On the ground, Tyri, Jorad, and the dwarves achieve victory, but Dar'khan shows up, eviscerates Loggi, and kidnaps Anveena in front of their eyes, ending the book.\n\nIn the final book of the series, Dar'khan flies Anveena over to the ruins of Quel'thalas (the elven homeland), and the four heroes try to stop him. A band of exiled elves, led by Lor'themar (a former ranger-captain), try to reclaim Quel'thalas by ambushing lone groups of undead. Meanwhile, Kalecgos, Tyrygosa, and Jorad Mace and their juvenile dragon Raac are trying to find out what is going on. Along the way, they are ambushed by a large, vicious Felhound, a magic-eating monster. They are initially unable to stop it, but a distant figure lets out a horrid screech that temporarily stops the Felhound's magic, allowing Kalec to finish it off. They are then confronted by Lor'themar's group, and they band together to try to stop Dar'khan. Meanwhile, Dar'khan takes Anveena to the former sight of SunwelI the source of elven magic, which was destroyed by the undead. Along the way, he explains why he is taking her there, but in his monologue, Anveena slips off. She is then confronted by a mysterious cloaked figure, who tries to tell her that she was the essence of the Sunwell itself. Anveena doesn't believe him, and soon Dar'khan finds her again. Dar'khan then finds the figure that stopped the Felhound, who proves to be Sylvanas Windrunner, former general of elven forces. She tries to kill him, blaming him for the destruction of her homeland, but he tricks her and takes her prisoner. He then goes to the former site of the Sunwell where he prepares to cast his spell on Anveena, but Lor'themar and his elves attack. They are driven back, but delay him momentarily. Kalec, Tyri, and Jorad then arrive and try to stop Dar'khan. He restrains Kalec with the magical neck collar he put around him in the first book. Tyri is delayed by a massive dragon controlled by Dar'khan, and the hopes of victory look bleak. Raac frees the dragon from Dar'khan's control and they all manage to stop Dar'khan. After he is defeated, the giant dragon transformed into the cloaked figure Anveena spoke to earlier. He is revealed as Borel, whose real name is Korialstrasz, the consort of Alexstrasza the Life-Binder. At the end, Tyri flies Jorad to confront Arthas, Lord of the Undead Scourge, and Anveena stays in Quel'thalas with Kalec and Lor'themar to hide her power.\n\n\n"}

Requests are made using port numbers as identifiers and xinetd usually launches another daemon to handle the request. It can be used to start services with both privileged and non-privileged port numbers.\n\nxinetd features access control mechanisms such as TCP Wrapper ACLs, extensive logging capabilities, and the ability to make services available based on time. It can place limits on the number of servers that the system can start, and has deployable defense mechanisms to protect against port scanners, among other things.\n\nOn some implementations of Mac OS X, this daemon starts and maintains various Internet-related services, including FTP and telnet. As an extended form of inetd, it offers enhanced security. It replaced inetd in Mac OS X v10.3, and subsequently launchd replaced it in Mac OS X v10.4. However, Apple has retained inetd for compatibility purposes.\n\nConfiguration of xinetd resides in the default configuration file /etc/xinetd.conf and configuration of the services it supports reside in configuration files stored in the /etc/xinetd.d directory. The configuration for each service usually includes a switch to control whether xinetd should enable or disable the service.\n\nAn example configuration file for the RFC 868 time server:\n\nThe lines with the \"#\" character at the beginning are comments without any effect on the service. There are two service versions the first one is based on the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the second one is based on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The type and planned usage of a service determines the necessary core protocol. In a simple way, the UDP can not handle huge data transmissions, because it lacks the abilities to rearrange packages in a specified order or guarantee their integrity, but it is faster than TCP. TCP has these functions, but it is slower. There are two column in each versions inside the Braces. The first is the type of option, the second is the applied variable.\n\nThe \"disable\" option is a switch to run a service or not. In most cases the default state is \"yes\". To activate the service change it to \"no\".\n\nThere are three \"types\" of services. The type is \"INTERNAL\" if the service is provided by xinetd, \"RPC\" when it based on Remote procedure call, they are commonly listed in the /etc/rpc file, or it can be \"UNLISTED\" when the service is neither in the /etc/services nor in the /etc/rpc files.\n\nThe \"id\" is the unique identifier of the service.\n\nThe \"socket_type\" determines the way of data transmission through the service. There are three types: \"stream\", \"dgram\" and \"raw\". This last one is useful, when we want to establish a service based on a non-standard protocol.\n\nWith the \"user\" option it is possible to choose a user to be the owner of the running service. It is highly recommended to choose a non-root user for security reasons.\n\nWhen the \"wait\" is on \"yes\" the xinetd will not receive request for the service if it has a connection. So the number of connections is limited to one. It provides very good protection when we want to establish only one connection per time.\n\nThere are many more options available for xinetd. In most Linux distributions the full list of possible options and their description is accessible with a \"man xinetd.conf\" command.\n\nTo apply the new configuration a SIGHUP signal must be sent to the xinetd process to make it re-read the configuration files. This can be achieved with the following command: codice_1. PID is the actual process identifier number of the xinetd, which can be obtained with the command codice_2.\n\n"}

The name evolved from the original name \"T-formula_1-gram\" to describe the axes of temperature (T) and entropy (formula_1) used to create the plot. Usually, temperature and dew point data from radiosondes are plotted on these diagrams to allow calculations of convective stability or convective available potential energy (CAPE). Wind barbs are often plotted at the side of a tephigram to indicate the winds at different heights.\n\nThe tephigram was invented by Napier Shaw in 1915 and is used primarily in the United Kingdom and Canada. Other countries use similar thermodynamic diagrams for the same purpose however the details of their construction vary. In the tephigram, isotherms are straight and have a 45 degree inclination to the right while isobars are horizontal and have a slight curve. Dry adiabats are also straight and have a 45 degree inclination to the left while moist adiabats are curved.\n\nThe main reason that tephigrams are used by the British Met Office, the Meteorological Service of Canada, and Met Éireann (Irish Meteorological Service) is the property that areas contained by the curves have equal energies for equal areas, leading to better comparisons of CAPE and hence convective systems.\n\n\n\n"}

The film was to have been the first in a five-year exclusive association between Universal Pictures and Sanen Productions of Mexico. It was the second of five collaborations between Siegel and Eastwood, following \"Coogan's Bluff\" (1968). The collaboration continued with \"The Beguiled\" and \"Dirty Harry\" (both 1971) and finally \"Escape from Alcatraz\" (1979).\n\nThe plot follows an American mercenary who gets mixed up with a nun and aids a group of Juarista rebels during the puppet reign of Emperor Maximilian in Mexico. The film featured both American and Mexican actors and actresses, including being filmed in the picturesque countryside near Tlayacapan, Morelos. Ennio Morricone composed the film's music.\n\nJust after the American Civil War, a former soldier, Hogan, comes up on a naked woman about to be raped by bandits. He kills the bandits, but is taken aback when he discovers that the woman he has saved is a nun by the name of Sister Sara, who is raising money to assist a group of Mexican revolutionaries who are fighting the French. When Sara requests that Hogan take her to their camp, he agrees because he had previously arranged to help the selfsame Mexican revolutionaries attack the French garrison in exchange for half the garrison's treasury, if they are successful.\n\nAs the duo heads towards the camp, evading French troops all the while, Hogan is surprised that the nun drinks his whiskey. Before he attempts to detonate a charge to destroy a French ammunition train, he is attacked by Indians and wounded with an arrow. Sara is able to bandage him, but as Hogan is now unable to set up the detonation charge, she assists him in destroying the train. Eventually the two reach Juarista commander Col. Beltran's camp, where Sara reveals to Hogan that she is not a nun but a prostitute posing as a nun, because the French are looking for her due to her assistance of the revolutionaries. Although Hogan is shocked, the two team up and provide the Mexicans with the money needed to purchase dynamite for the assault.\n\nBecause the detonation of the train has put the French garrison on high alert, Hogan and Sara infiltrate the fortress with Hogan posing as a bounty hunter, take out the commanding staff, and open the gates for the Mexican revolutionary forces to swarm through. A battle ensues; the French are defeated, and the Mexicans capture the fort. As promised, Hogan receives half the riches. Now wealthy and his job completed, Hogan sets off with Sara, with whom he has fallen in love, to open a gambling house in San Francisco.\n\n\nBudd Boetticher, a long term-resident of Mexico renowned for his series of Randolph Scott westerns, wrote the original 1967 screenplay that was bought with the provision that he would direct. Boetticher had planned the film for Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr, who had played a man of action and a nun in \"Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison\". Kerr's character was a member of the Mexican aristocracy escaping the vengeance of the Mexican Revolution, with Mitchum's cowboy protecting her as he led her to safety to the United States.\n\nCarrol Case sold the screenplay to Martin Rackin, who had Albert Maltz, also living in Mexico, rewrite the story. Maltz's version had Clint Eastwood playing a soldier of fortune for the Juaristas and Shirley MacLaine playing a revolutionary prostitute now set during the French intervention in Mexico. The film saw Eastwood embody the tall mysterious stranger once more, unshaven, wearing a serape-like vest and smoking a cigar and the film score was composed by Ennio Morricone. Although the film had Leonesque dirty Hispanic villains, the film was considerably less crude and more sardonic than those of Leone.\n\nBoetticher expressed disgust that MacLaine's bawdy character obviously did not resemble a nun, as opposed to his idea of a genteel lady whose final revelation would have been more of a surprise to the audience. Though Boetticher was friends with both Eastwood and director Don Siegel, Siegel understood Boetticher's dislike of the final film. Boetticher asked Siegel how he could make an awful film like that; Siegel replied that it was a great feeling to wake up in the morning and know there was a check in the mail, and Boetticher riposted that it was a better feeling to wake up in the morning and be able to look at yourself in the mirror.\n\nEastwood had been shown the script by Elizabeth Taylor (at the time, the wife of Richard Burton) during the filming of \"Where Eagles Dare\"; she hoped to play the role of Sister Sara. It was initially offered to her, but she had to turn down the role because she wanted to shoot in Spain where Burton was making his latest film. Sister Sara was supposed to be Mexican, but Shirley MacLaine was cast instead. Although they were initially unconvinced with her pale complexion, Eastwood believed that the studio was keen on MacLaine as they had high hopes for her film \"Sweet Charity\", in which she played a taxi dancer. Both Siegel and Eastwood felt intimidated by her on set, and Siegel described Clint's co-star thus: \"It's hard to feel any great warmth to her. She's too unfeminine and has too much balls. She's very, very hard.\" \"Two Mules for Sister Sara\" marked the last time that Eastwood would receive second billing for a film, and it would be 25 years until he risked being overshadowed by a leading lady again—in \"The Bridges of Madison County\" (1995).\n\nThe film was shot over 65 days in Mexico and cost around $4 million. Many of the cast and crew, including MacLaine, were stricken by illness while filming, due to having to adjust to the food and water in Mexico.\n\nBruce Surtees was a camera operator on the film, and acted as a go-between for Siegel and cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa; this led to his working on Siegel's next film \"The Beguiled\". Figueroa used many photographic filters for effects in the film.\n\nEastwood revealed that he actually killed a rattlesnake for a scene in the film, as Mexican authorities did not want it released in the area after filming was over. Eastwood noted that he did not want to kill it, as he is opposed to killing animals.\n\nThe film returned $4.7 million in North American domestic rentals, rendering it a solid, modestly profitable hit (a movie's gross is often close to twice the domestic rentals figure).\n\n\"Two Mules for Sister Sara\" received moderately favorable reviews, and Roger Greenspun of the \"New York Times\" reported, \"I'm not sure it is a great movie, but it is very good and it stays and grows on the mind the way only movies of exceptional narrative intelligence do\". Stanley Kauffmann described the film as \"an attempt to keep old Hollywood alive—a place where nuns \"can\" turn out to be disguised whores, where heroes \"can\" always have a stick of dynamite under their vests, where every story has not one but two cute finishes. Its kind of \"The African Queen\" gone west\". In a review by the \"Los Angeles Herald-Examiner\", \"Two Mules for Sister Sara\" was called \"a solidly entertaining film that provides Clint Eastwood with his best, most substantial role to date; in it he is far better than he has ever been. In director Don Siegel, Eastwood has found what John Wayne found in John Ford and what Gary Cooper found in Frank Capra.\" \n\n\"The New York Times\" in its book, \"The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made\" included \"Two Mules for Sister Sara\" in its top 1,000 films of all time. Author Howard Hughes joked that critics \"couldn't argue that Eastwood's acting was second to nun.\"\n\nQuentin Tarantino later called it \"a half-hearted half-assed attempt to do a Corbucci like western, mixed in with a bit of “The African Queen” style battle of the sexes. When it’s just Eastwood & MacLaine out in the desert by themselves, the film is lightly amusing. But its lack of commitment, mediocre premise, script, action, and outcome, not to mention Eastwood’s silly looking leather hat ultimately do it in.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Ingpen. It is based on the old tales of the Hairy Peruvians, a community of tiny fisherfolk, who centuries ago sprang to life from sacrificial Inca dolls on the coast of Peru. The Hairy Peruvians had lived on this coast for generations, often at the mercy of El Nino, the temperamental sea god. Over the years, many expeditions set out in flimsy reed boats to see a more hospitable land across the ocean to the west, but none returned.\n\nThe Poppykettle Papers recounts the exploits of Aloof the Far-Sighted and his resourceful sister Arnica and their quest to find the Unchosen Land in the company of Andante the Whistler, Astute the Wise, and their grandfather Don Avante.\n\nThis is that tale of five Hairy Peruvians, the last of their kind, and an epic journey from the shores of old Peru to a new land at World's Edge, where the sun goes down. These are no ordinary adventurers, however, but \"people of sensible size\", which to us Tall Ones is very small indeed.\n\nIn 1980, Robert Ingpen published \"The Voyage of the Poppykettle\", a children's book. He later published \"The Unchosen Land\", its sequel.\n\nThese stories were so popular in Ingpen's home, Geelong, that a fountain and an annual Poppykettle Festival celebrate the mythical landing of the \"hairy Peruvians\".\n\n\"The Poppykettle Papers\" is an updated re-telling of the original two books.\n\nThe book ties into various historical and folkloric stories of Australia's early settlement.\n\nOne such story is the discovery in 1847, by Governor Charles La Trobe, of a set of keys embedded in the earth near Corio Bay. These keys, known as the Geelong Keys, are believed by some to have been dropped by Portuguese explorers some hundreds of years previously, but the Poppykettle Papers suggest another origin—namely, that the Hairy Peruvians left them there.\n"}

Specifically the 250-350 men of the Operational Raiders Group are the special forces section of the elite unit.\n\n\nCOMSUBIN's origins lie with the famous Italian special units \"X MAS\" (Italian acronym for \"Anti Submarine Motorboats\"). The name referred to an early vehicle employed by the units, an explosive-laden crewless motorboat (\"barchino\") which was aimed and launched against enemy submersibles (keep in mind that until well after World War II subs were essentially surface ships with the capability of temporarily diving underwater for attacks). After World War I much study and development went into underwater raid techniques but the unit's name was never altered, leading to the false impression that Italian seafaring commandos were still relegated to anti-submarine warfare only.\nInstead many flotillas were armed and equipped to direct raids on enemy ships using explosive head-charges in guided torpedoes with 2-man crews (\"Siluri a Lenta Corsa\" or S.L.C.), with hand explosive charges (by frogmen) or with small, fast, self-explosive boats (S.M.A.).\n\nCOMSUBIN GOI personnel are largely drawn from the ranks of the Navy's San Marco Marine Brigade.\n\nAlso the raiders approached the target by means of submarines with special tanks installed on the external bridge containing the special vehicles (S.L.C.).\n\n\n\nThe Carabinieri is a Gendarmerie (military police) with both (civil and military) law-and-order police duties and military peacekeeping and war-fighting capabilities.\n\nThe special unit SOF is the 1° Reggimento Carabinieri Paracadutisti \"Tuscania\" (1st Carabinieri Airborne Regiment Tuscania).

Some of his most popular songs include: \"\"Ciganče\"\", \"\"Nisam lopov\"\", \"\"Voli me danas više nego juče\"\", \"\"Doberman\"\", \"\"Pomirenje\"\", and superhit \"\"Ne može nam niko ništa\"\". He was a long-time collaborator and friend of late Novica Urošević.\n\nMitar Mirić was born on 16 January 1957, in the village of Bogutovo Selo near the town of Ugljevik in the northeastern part of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia (modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina). He finished secondary school in Ugljevik. He began his professional musical career in 1975 and moved to Serbia in 1976, where he has been living ever since.\n\nHe began his professional career in 1975 with the release of his first single, \"Od mene je ljubav jaca\", on newly established Diskoton, based in Sarajevo, followed by another single, \"Kad se spusti tiho vece\", on national record label PGP-RTB, based in capital Belgrade, in Serbia. In 1976 he moved to Serbia, and joined recording house \"Diskos\" based in Aleksandrovac. Diskos was among the major record labels of former Yugoslavia. He began singing in a Sremska Mitrovica restaurant. An important part in his success and career was Novica Urošević, who had written for Mitar from 1979 until 1997. Another important part was Branimir Đokić's orchestra which accompanied Mirić from 1979 to 1984, with whom he recorded four singles, and five albums.\n\nFor a concert in Croatia, Mirić has a fee of 4000 €.\n\nHis single \"Ne može nam niko ništa\" became a huge hit. When the Serbia national under-19 football team won the 2013 European Championship, \"Ne može nam niko ništa\" was sung by the players during celebration, and later a video was released in which some players were guests at Mitar Mirić's house where they together sung it to the accordion.\n\nHe is the favourite singer of Serbian footballer Duško Tošić, and his hit song has been sung by Bosnian Serb politician Milorad Dodik on cultural festivals, Croatian football coach Zdravko Mamić during a TV show and a wedding.\n\nHe lives in central Belgrade, with his wife Suzana and daughter Sanja. He was involved in a car crash on 6 May 2005, in Orašje, in which his car stopped a few metres from a mine field. His \"kum\" was Novica Urošević, who died from alcoholism in 2009.

He had been the first-choice England wicket-keeper on numerous occasions during his career, but was never able to hold on to the role long term.\n\nChris is married to Louise and together they have two children, a son named Caleb Mattias Wells Read, who was born on 3 May 2009, and a daughter named Callista Lily Read, \nthey have two nephew Ale Wells Read and Max Wells Read, who was born on 18 January 2011. On 4 November 2007 Read ran the New York City Marathon to raise money for Bowel Cancer UK in honour of his first cricket coach, Trevor Ward, who died of the disease. Read finished 4358th out of over 90,000 runners, placing him in the top 5%.\n\nRead played for Devon in a NatWest Trophy match at the age of 16, and in 1997 made a single AXA Life League appearance for Gloucestershire, claiming an NBC Denis Compton Award that year. After an England A tour to Kenya and Sri Lanka in the winter - making his first-class debut in Nairobi - Read was picked up by Nottinghamshire for the 1998 season. By June he had established himself in the side and he claimed 42 dismissals that summer as well as making 401 runs.\n\nSeveral years in the international wilderness followed, Read being overlooked in favour of first Paul Nixon and then James Foster as keeper-in-waiting in preparation for the retirement of Alec Stewart. Left to concentrate on his county cricket career, Read claimed 68 dismissals in 2002 and worked at his batting, that year averaging nearly 35 with another hundred coming against Northamptonshire. He made a one-day century against the same opponents early in 2003 and with Stewart's retirement from international one-day cricket, he was recalled by England that year, playing in all ten ODIs.\n\nIn the 2004 English season, Jones was preferred for the series against New Zealand and West Indies in both Tests and One-Day Internationals, having made a century in the second Test of the New Zealand series. Read returned to Nottinghamshire and had by far his best season with the bat: he scored 807 first-class runs including two centuries, and averaged over 50. The selectors stuck with Jones, however, and by the summer of 2005 Read was not even second-choice keeper for England in ODIs, Matt Prior of Sussex being preferred for the role. Read was again overlooked in the squad for the winter tour of Pakistan, instead being selected for the second-tier ECB National Academy squad. As first choice wicket-keeper in the Academy squad, Read got several opportunities to play, and had a successful tour, scoring 254 runs at an average of 66.25 in the West Indies before he had to prematurely return home to attend to a family emergency.\n\nRead continued to be on the fringes of England squads, and was selected for the England 'A' team against the touring Pakistan side in 2006, off the back of a strong start to the county season which had seen him average 50 in both formats of the game. He took advantage of his selection, scoring an unbeaten 150 in the tour match. Soon after, Geraint Jones, who had remained first choice for England despite a slump in batting form, broke a finger in the second Test match against Pakistan in 2006; the next day Read scored a rapid 72 against Northamptonshire in a Natwest Pro 40 League game.\n\nIn September 2007, Read took over as the captain of Nottinghamshire. The team were promoted in the championship that summer and Read averaged 54.17 with the bat. In 2009 Read had an excellent season with Nottinghamshire, scoring 1,203 runs at an average of 75.18 including 4 centuries in first-class cricket. His form with the bat has largely continued since.\n\nHe averaged 45.80 in 2010, 37.37 in 2011, 48.75 in 2012, and, after a lean year in 2013, has had a profitable last two seasons. In 2014 he averaged 43.85 and, as of September 2015, he is topping Notts' current batting averages with 63.50. Year 2015 also saw him pass 15,000 first-class runs and 1,000 first-class dismissals, with his 1000th dismissal being Paul Collingwood. He led the team to their sixth championship in 2010, and top-scored with 53 off 52 balls as they won the 2013 Yorkshire Bank 40 final.\n\nIn July 2014, he played for the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's.\n\nHe toured Zimbabwe and South Africa with the A team the following winter, and in 1999 his maiden first-class century, a well-timed 160 against Warwickshire, brought him selection for the first Test against New Zealand at Edgbaston. Still not 21, Read made a good impression: although he failed with the bat, he claimed eight dismissals, six in the second innings alone. He was retained for Lord's, but suffered a very public embarrassment when he was bowled for zero, ducking what he thought was a beamer from Chris Cairns but was in fact a well-disguised slower ball. 37 in the second innings was followed by another duck at Old Trafford, and he was dropped, though he did play in the 1999/2000 One Day International series in South Africa.\n\nRead was first-choice keeper for the 2003/04 tours and played in eight of the nine Tests that winter, against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and West Indies. However, for the final Test of the West Indies series, in Antigua, he was replaced by Kent wicket-keeper Geraint Jones. This would be the game in which Brian Lara made his world-record score of 400 not out.\nRead was retained for the one-day squad however, winning the man-of-the match award in the first game of that series, for a quickfire unbeaten 27 in a rain-affected run chase.\n\nOn 31 July Read was recalled to the England squad as a replacement for Jones. Chairman of Selectors David Graveney stressed that this was down to Jones' poor form with the bat rather than his injury. Read took advantage of the opportunity with 38 in the first innings of the 3rd Test against Pakistan, and then completing his first Test half-century, shepherding the tail in the second innings whilst making 55, to add to a sharp performance (four catches and a stumping) behind the wickets. Despite finishing the summer as first choice, Read was passed over for a 12-month central contract for 2007 - the England selectors deciding to keep their options open by not contracting any wicket-keeper.\n\nPrior to the first Test in the 2006-2007 England Ashes tour of Australia, Read was dropped in favour of Geraint Jones. England coach Duncan Fletcher said that Jones would be \"a better prospect for batting at number seven\".\nNotts Director of Cricket, Mick Newell, responded to Fletcher's decision by calling his selection \"bizarre\".\n\nRead was selected to play for two tour matches for England between the Second and Third Tests. In the first, against Australia Chairman's XI, Read was dismissed for a duck. In the two-day match against Western Australia, Read scored 59 not out while Jones, playing as a batsman, went for a first ball duck. Under increased pressure, Jones retained his place for the third Test but failed to score in either innings - the first and second ducks of his Test career - leading to Read being selected for the fourth Test. Though he struggled with the bat in the final two Tests, he took 6 catches in the first innings of the fourth Test, becoming only the 3rd player in Test history to take 6 dismissals in an innings twice.\nRead repeated that performance with another 6 dismissals in the first innings of the 5th Test in Sydney, making him the first, and so far only, keeper in Test history to achieve the feat in successive Tests. For the subsequent one-day tournament, and the following World Cup, Read was overlooked for selection, with Paul Nixon taking over the wicketkeeper position. The following summer, the Test wicketkeeping position was given to Matt Prior, who scored a century on his Test debut and retained his place for the subsequent one-day matches.\n\n\"as of 9 September 2010\"\n"}

Express. At the time the group consisted of Rich Thompson on lead guitar and Bill Risbrook on tenor saxophone who were the nucleus of King House Rockers. Also in the group were Louis Risbrook on bass who was the brother of Bill on solo flute, alto sax, piccolo and clarinet. There was also Olando T. Woods on drums and singer Barbara Joyce Lomas. The latest member was Dennis Rowe on congas. Carlos Wards who was born in Panama had played with The John Coltrane Octet, Don Cherry, Pharoah Sanders, and McCoy Tyner. Barbara Joyce Lomas who came from Alabama had been with the Uptights and sang on their single, \"Free At Last\" bw \"You Git’s None Of This\", released on Skye Records SKYE 4525.\n\nThe group was part of the \"Brooklyn sound\" of the early 1970s, formed from three players of the group King Davis House Rockers. The House Rockers were a local dance band who had released a couple of obscure singles (1967's \"We All Make Mistakes Sometimes\" on Verve Records, 1972's \"Rum Punch\") \n\nThe single, \"Baby You Satisfy Me\" bw \"We All Make Mistakes Sometimes\" was credited to King Davis House Rockers featuring Richard Thomas, and was released on Verve VK 10492 in February 1967. In 1969, the King Davis produced \"What Do I Have To Do\" bw \"We All Make Mistakes Sometimes\", credited to Rick Thompson was released on Columbia 4-44880. There was also a single by The Visitors, \"Holiday in Love\" bw \"Rum Punch\" which was released on Airways LK-2000. It was composed by L. Risbrook, C. Ward and C. Stephenson. It was co-produced by Stephenson and King Davis. It was also released on Straker's Records S-0046 with \"Rum Punch\" as the A side.\n\nThe three players (guitarist Richard Thompson, tenor sax player Bill Risbrook, and alto sax player Carlos Ward) formed Madison Street Express along with bassist Louis Risbrook (later Muslim-monickered Jamal Rasool), percussionist Dennis Rowe, drummer Terrell Wood, and vocalist Barbara Wood.\n\nThe members of Madison Street Express along with producer Jeff Lane signed with production company Roadshow Records to record writer Billy Nichols \"Do It ('Til You're Satisfied).\" The record was shopped around to major labels until it was accepted at Scepter Records. Scepter suggested the group change its name from Madison Street Express, hence the Brooklyn Transit Express. The single was released in August 1974, and reached the top 10. Lane took the group back into the studios at that point to record a second single and pitch a full album to the label. Scepter agreed to the LP and to Roadshow Records having its own label within Scepter Records.\n\nThe first two singles were hits, both number 1 R&B releases and both Top 5 pop singles in the US. The album hit number 1 on the R&B album chart and number 5 on the Pop album chart of the US. These recordings were also hits in the spreading disco culture, \"Do It\" peaking on club playlists before Billboard started a separate disco chart, but the follow-up single sat for five weeks at number 1. They were certified gold releases.\n\nBT Express released an album per year through 1978. With the third album, Leslie Ming was brought in as drummer and Michael Jones was added as keyboardist. Jamal, who had converted to Islam, gave Jones the name Kashif Saleem, which he used after departing the group, in 1979, to pursue producing (\"Mighty M Productions\" with Morrie Brown and Paul Laurence Jones) and solo recording ventures. That year songwriter Billy Nichols and drummer Leslie Ming also departed the group. In 1976 Scepter records was experiencing business difficulties that soon ended the company, and BT Express was given a distribution deal with Columbia Records, which, though it gave them greater exposure, resulted in less attention being paid to their production, since they had so many acts to concentrate on. The group did not achieve the level of radio or sales success on Columbia that they had on the more nurturing but by-then defunct Scepter. They stayed with Columbia for five years, with Lane producing through 1978, then Nichols producing their fifth album before he departed for solo work, and Morrie Brown producing the sixth LP and several follow-up tracks. The group switched labels to Coast To Coast Records for the 1982 LP, to Earthtone Records for a later 1982 single, and to manager King Davis' own label in 1985.\n\nMichael Jones, later known as Kashif died at his home in the Playa del Rey neighborhood of Los Angeles, on September 25, 2016, at age 59.\n\n\n"}

He is referred to as the \"King of Folk Music\" (\"\"kralj narodne muzike\"\").\n\nŠaban Šaulić was born on 6 September 1951 in Šabac, PR Serbia, FPR Yugoslavia to Bosniak parents Ilduza Demirović and Huso Šaulić. Neither of his parents had a full-time job, as his father sold lottery tickets whilst his mother sold children's toys at fetes. As a result, they would spend a lot of their time travelling and looking for work leaving Šaulić primarily in the care of his older sister, Sarajka.\n\nŠaulić initially showed interest and affinity for football. It was his uncle Alija, however, who first noticed that his nephew's true talent lay in music. In the mid-1960s, Alija asked his nephew to sing at their local kafana, which was to mark the start of Šaulić's five decade long musical career. Šaban Šaulić is of Bosniak descent. \n\nIn 1969, at the age of 18, Šaulić recorded his first single \"Dajte mi utjehu\" (\"Give me Solace\"). The song became an instant hit and led Šaulić to make the move to Belgrade, Serbia so that he could continue working on what was promising to be a successful career. By the mid-70s, Šaulić had become a household name and his songs were much requested in kafane.\n\nŠaulić was also a judge on the televised singing competition Zvezde Granda between 2013 and 2016, and the televised singing competition \"Pinkove zvezde\" in 2016-2017 season. \n\nIn 1974, Šaulić married his wife, Gordana (b. 1958). The pair briefly separated in 1985; during this period, Šaulić wrote and dedicated the song \"\"Gordana\"\" to her. Šaulić and his wife reconciled after just 20 days. Together, they had three children; a son, Mihajlo, and two daughters, Sanela and Ilda. Ilda is also a singer.\n\nPrior to his marriage to Gordana, Šaulić had a son out of wedlock, named Robert. He acknowledged him and provided financial support until Robert turned 18.\n\nŠaulić's father died unexpectedly during Šaban's concert tour of Australia. He was not able to attend his father's funeral which was held the very next day. Šaulić would often express how he would never be able to come to terms with the fact that he was not in attendance.\n\nŠaban Šaulić has lost his hair in 1974. He has made one of the wigs in Germany, which has dropped in 2002 in favour of real bald scalp because of the famous Serbian basketball player Aleksandar Đorđević.\n\nIn the early hours of 17 February 2019, Šaulić was being driven to the airport on his way home as he had held a concert the night before in Bielefeld, Germany. His best man, Boban Stojadinović, was a fellow passenger in the car.

Most Core Foundation routines follow a certain naming convention that deal with opaque objects, for example CFDictionaryRef for functions whose names begin with CFDictionary, and these objects are often reference counted (manually) through codice_1 and codice_2. Internally, Core Foundation forms the base of the types in the Objective-C standard library and the Carbon API.\n\nThe most prevalent use of Core Foundation is for passing its own primitive types for data, including raw bytes, Unicode strings, numbers, calendar dates, and UUIDs, as well as collections such as arrays, sets, and dictionaries, to numerous macOS C routines, primarily those that are GUI-related. At the operating system level Core Foundation also provides standardized application preferences management through codice_3, bundle handling, run loops, interprocess communication through codice_4 and codice_5, and a basic graphical user interface message dialog through codice_6.\n\nOther parts of the API include utility routines and wrappers around existing APIs for ease of use. Utility routines perform such actions as file system and network I/O through codice_7, codice_8, and codice_9 and endianness translation (Byte Order Utilities). Some examples of wrapper routines include those for Core Foundation's wrapper routines for Unix sockets, the CFSocket API.\n\nSome types in Core Foundation are \"toll-free bridged\", or interchangeable with a simple cast, with those of their Foundation Kit counterparts. For example, one could create a codice_10 Core Foundation type, and then later simply use a standard C cast to convert it to its Objective-C counterpart, codice_11, and then use the desired Objective-C methods on that object as one normally would.\n\nCore Foundation has a plug-in model (CFPlugin) that is based on the Microsoft Component Object Model.\n\nApple used to release most of CF as an open-source project called CFLite that can be used to write cross-platform applications for macOS, Linux, and Windows.\n\nA third-party open-source implementation called OpenCFLite extends the Apple CFLite for building on 32-bit Windows and Linux environments. It is maintained by one of the WebKit developers, but was stalled by 2015. The karaoke platform KJams maintains a fork since 2017. This version, by its programmer David M. Cotter, supports 64-bit systems and has a CFNetwork implementation with LibreSSL-based TLS.\n\nThe Swift Corelib Foundation, a fallback version of the Foundation Kit for the Swift programming language for non-Apple platforms, contains a near-full version of the Core Foundation released under Apache License 2.0.\n\nGNUstep includes a version of the Core Foundation called \"libs-corebase\". It is not as complete enough for the project to use it as the basis of their Foundation Kit implementation like Apple does for its implementations.

He is often described as part of the turbo-folk scene, and is known for his Serbian patriotic songs. His cousin was the pop-folk recording artist Ksenija Pajčin.\n\nPajčin is not to be mistaken with Nedeljko Bajić Baja (to whom he owes his nickname due to their physical resemblance), who is another Bosnian Serb folk singer.\n\nPajčin was born on 13 October 1966 into a Bosnian Serb family in the village of Gubin, near Livno, Bosnia and Herzegovina. \n\nPajčin moved to SR Serbia in 1980, and began singing in 1984 in Surčin.\n\nBaja won a 1989 competition for amateur singers in Livno and released his first album in 1991. His career began just as Yugoslavia was breaking up. Throughout the 1990s, he was known for his strong Serbian nationalism and nationalist songs supporting the Serbs during the Yugoslav wars; during the Croatian War of Independence he was dubbed \"Baja Mali-Knindža\" (literally meaning \"Baja little Kninja\" in reference to the de facto capital, Knin, of the Serbian ethnic breakaway state of Serbian Krajina within Croatia and its armed force). His first professional success was the song \"Врати се Војводо\" (\"Come Back, Voivode\"), in which he appealed to Serbian World War II Chetnik commander Momčilo Đujić to come back to the areas of the Croatian Krajina and help lift the spirits of the Croatian Serbs. He said that he would never consider going to Croatia as he claimed that Croatian soldiers \"burned down his house and desecrated his ancestors' graves\".\n\nBaja performs at \"Кочићев збор\" (\"Kočić's Assembly\") in Zmijanje near Banja Luka in mid-August every year, and he usually attracts tens of thousands of people. Since Operation Storm, Pajčin has written many songs about his dream of the Serb people returning to live in territories now inhabited by Croats following the Croatian War for Independence.\n\nPajčin is controversial due to his Serbian nationalism and Serbian far-right views and bias in lyrics. Most of his songs are condemned in non-Serb parts of Bosnia and Croatia because of their xenophobic lyrics, which often reference war leaders during the Yugoslav wars. For example, his song \"Ne volim te Alija\" describes his strong dislike for the Bosnian wartime president Alija Izetbegović and includes the lyrics:\n\nIn one song titled \"Ćuti, Ćuti Ujko!\" (the song and music video feature Serbian rock star Bora Đorđević, \"I will kill you\" as well as \"Shut up, shut up, mujo (Bosnian Muslim), I will kill you\". He has also sung \"I don't like people who like the HDZ\", which included the lyrics \"Fuck their šahovnica\".\n\nDespite many of his songs having a nationalistic lyrical theme, he is also known for his often humorous non-political songs such as \"Umri Baba\" and \"Poker Aparat\".\n\nHe has also sung anti-communist songs such as \"Bila Jednom Jedna Zemlja\" and the song \"Komunjare\", which says:\n\nPajačin lives with his wife, three daughters and a son in Zemun. Besides his native language, he also speaks English and Russian. His mother and father live in a newly built house in Surčin.\n\nBaja is a supporter of the Serbian Radical Party, and has sung at the party's conventions. He also released an album, \"Српским радикалима\" (\"Serbian Radicals\", 1998), which glorifies the SRS and its leader Vojislav Šešelj.\n\nHis cousin Ksenija Pajčin, pop-folk recording artist, was murdered by her ex-boyfriend on March 16, 2010. Later that same year Pajačin released the song \"Spavaj, kraljice\" (\"Sleep, Queen\") in her memory. He said that he was very \"shaken\" by her death.\n\n"}

They are developed and maintained by the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) Division (formerly the NASA Numerical Aerodynamic Simulation Program) based at the NASA Ames Research Center. NAS solicits performance results for NPB from all sources.\n\nTraditional benchmarks that existed before NPB, such as the Livermore loops, the LINPACK Benchmark and the NAS Kernel Benchmark Program, were usually specialized for vector computers. They generally suffered from inadequacies including parallelism-impeding tuning restrictions and insufficient problem sizes, which rendered them inappropriate for highly parallel systems. Equally unsuitable were full-scale application benchmarks due to high porting cost and unavailability of automatic software parallelization tools. As a result, NPB were developed in 1991 and released in 1992 to address the ensuing lack of benchmarks applicable to highly parallel machines.\n\nThe first specification of NPB recognized that the benchmarks should feature\nIn the light of these guidelines, it was deemed the only viable approach to use a collection of \"paper-and-pencil\" benchmarks that specified a set of problems only algorithmically and left most implementation details to the implementer's discretion under certain necessary limits.\n\nNPB 1 defined eight benchmarks, each in two problem sizes dubbed \"Class A\" and \"Class B\". Sample codes written in Fortran 77 were supplied. They used a small problem size \"Class S\" and were not intended for benchmarking purposes.\n\nSince its release, NPB 1 displayed two major weaknesses. Firstly, due to its \"paper-and-pencil\" specification, computer vendors usually highly tuned their implementations so that their performance became difficult for scientific programmers to attain. Secondly, many of these implementation were proprietary and not publicly available, effectively concealing their optimizing techniques. Secondly, problem sizes of NPB 1 lagged behind the development of supercomputers as the latter continued to evolve.\n\nNPB 2, released in 1996, came with source code implementations for five out of eight benchmarks defined in NPB 1 to supplement but not replace NPB 1. It extended the benchmarks with an up-to-date problem size \"Class C\". It also amended the rules for submitting benchmarking results. The new rules included explicit requests for output files as well as modified source files and build scripts to ensure public availability of the modifications and reproducibility of the results.\n\nNPB 2.2 contained implementations of two more benchmarks. NPB 2.3 of 1997 was the first complete implementation in MPI. It shipped with serial versions of the benchmarks consistent with the parallel versions and defined a problem size \"Class W\" for small-memory systems. NPB 2.4 of 2002 offered a new MPI implementation and introduced another still larger problem size \"Class D\". It also augmented one benchmark with I/O-intensive subtypes.\n\nNPB 3 retained the MPI implementation from NPB 2 and came in more flavors, namely OpenMP, Java and High Performance Fortran. These new parallel implementations were derived from the serial codes in NPB 2.3 with additional optimizations. NPB 3.1 and NPB 3.2 added three more benchmarks, which, however, were not available across all implementations; NPB 3.3 introduced a \"Class E\" problem size. Based on the single-zone NPB 3, a set of multi-zone benchmarks taking advantage of the MPI/OpenMP hybrid programming model were released under the name NPB-Multi-Zone (NPB-MZ) for \"testing the effectiveness of multi-level and hybrid parallelization paradigms and tools\".\n\nAs of NPB 3.3, eleven benchmarks are defined as summarized in the following table.\n\n"}

The verses introduce the Sermon on the Mount that will be recited in the next several chapters. The mentioned the large crowds \"from Galilee, and from the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan\" who followed Jesus to witness him healing: these verses present Jesus as seeing the crowds and going up onto a mountain to begin teaching.\n\nThe original Koine Greek, according to Westcott and Hort, reads:\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nIn other English translations, the Geneva Bible, New International Version and God's Word Translation refer to \"a mountain\", whereas the Revised Standard Version and the New American Standard Bible refer to \"the mountain\". For a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 5:1-2\n\nThe reference to going up a mountain prior to preaching is considered by many to be a reference to Moses on Mount Sinai. Lapide feels that the clumsy phrasing implies that this verse is a transliteration from the Hebrew, and that it was an exact replica of a passage describing Moses. Boring notes that the reference to Jesus sitting may be an allusion to , where in some translations Moses is described as sitting on Mount Sinai. St. Augustine in his commentary on the Sermon on the Mount supported the Moses parallel. He argued that this symbolism shows that Jesus is giving a new set of precepts to supplement those of Moses. In his later writings, such as the \"Reply to Faustus\", he backs away from this view.\n\nOther scholars reject the link with Moses. Hill disagrees, arguing that if this had been intended as a reference to Exodus then the author of Matthew would have made the links far clearer. Hare also takes a different view. He reads the sequence of Jesus sitting, the disciples approaching, and then talking as depicting Jesus regally with the disciples approaching him as would subjects at a royal court. To Hare the reference to a mountain might thus be a reference to Mount Zion of David rather than of Sinai.\n\nThere are mountains in both Lower and Upper Galilee and several large hills in the region to the west of the Sea of Galilee. The Golan Heights lies to the east of the Sea of Galilee. There are a number of hills that have traditionally been claimed as the site of the sermon, but the best known is the one today known as the Mount of Beatitudes. A number of scholars do not feel \"the mountain\" is the most accurate understanding of the phrase. Gundry feels it could mean \"mountainous region\", while France feels it should be read as \"went up into the hills.\" Nolland notes that \"mountainous region' is another option for translating the phrase, though he believes \"a mountain\" is still the most accurate translation. Boring notes that this move to the mountains has been read as Jesus fleeing the crowds mentioned in . Many arguments about the nature of Jesus' mission and his psychology have been read into this avoidance of crowds. Boring disagrees, and believes the move to the hills is present only as a Mosaic parallel.\n\nThe introduction to the Sermon on the Plain also has Jesus go up into a mountain in , but he goes there merely to pray and descends before beginning his preaching. Some scholars have tried to reconcile the two accounts, with one proposal being that the sermon was delivered on a flat plain part-way up a mountain. Davies and Allison reject such an approach, as Luke made clear that Jesus descended prior to the speech. Davies and Allison also consider such reconciliation unnecessary as the sermon is a general summary of Jesus' teachings and was likely preached on many occasions.\n\nThis verse is the first place where the word disciples appears in the Gospel of Matthew. Its exact meaning is unclear. Some feel that it refers only to the small group of Jesus' followers, and that the Sermon was only directed to them. Albright and Mann support this view. Gundry feels that, at least in this verse, \"disciples\" has a much broader meaning and refers to any who came to hear Jesus, he feels the word is used interchangeably in this section with \"crowds\". makes clear the general crowd was listening to the Sermon. That Jesus sits down might indicate this is not meant to be a public address. Hill notes that Jewish leaders in schools and synagogues would always sit when delivering a lesson. Lachs disagrees with this, arguing that while sitting was a standard teaching position in the later half of the first century, in the early part of the century the tradition was to always stand while teaching to the Torah. Luke makes no mention of whether Jesus is sitting or standing. The traditional view, as depicted in art, is that the disciples sat near Jesus, with the crowd beyond but still able to hear. Lapide feels that Jesus' sermon is directed at three circles of listeners, his disciples, the crowd, and the world in general. Chrysostom was of the opinion that the sermon itself was delivered to the disciples, but that it was intended for wider distribution, which is why it was written down.\n\n\"Opened his mouth\" was a common Semitic expression at the time, well attested in literature from the period. In the New Testament it also appears and . Gundry feels that this is a reference to that mentions \"every word out of the mouth of God.\" Gundry thus feels that this turn of phrase is meant to imply that the Sermon are words spoken by God. Luke's Sermon on the Plain opens with Jesus \"lifting up his eyes\", and the two phrases might be related.\n\nHarrington notes that this is one of only two times in the Gospel that Jesus is described as teaching. Both reference the Sermon on the Mount, with the other reference at . Though Nolland notes that Matthew does not contain the same extensive John/Jesus parallels as Mark.\n"}

It is relevant particularly in corporate law and constitutional law. Apparent authority refers to a situation where a reasonable third party would understand that an agent had authority to act. This means a principal is bound by the agent's actions, even if the agent had no \"actual\" authority, whether express or implied. It raises an estoppel because the third party is given an assurance, which he relies on and would be inequitable for the principal to deny the authority given. Apparent authority can legally be found, even if actual authority has not been given.\n\nThere must be some act or some knowing omission on the part of the principal—if the agent alone acts to give the third party this false impression, then the principal is not bound. However, the principal will be bound if the agent so acts in the \"presence\" of the principal, and the principal stands silently and says nothing to dissuade the third party from believing that the agent has the authority to bind the principal. Apparent authority can also occur where a principal terminates the authority of an agent, but does not inform third parties of this termination. This is called lingering apparent authority. Business owners can avoid being liable by giving public notice of the termination of authority, and by contacting any individual third parties who would have had reason to know of such authority.\n\nIn relation to companies, the apparent authority of directors, officers and agents of the company is normally referred to as \"ostensible authority.\" Apparent authority issues also arise in the Fourth Amendment context, concerning who has authority to consent to a search.\n\nThe doctrine of apparent authority is based on the concept of estoppel, thus, it prevents the principal from denying the existence of agency to a third party, provided that a representation, as to the agent's authority, has been made by him to the third party either through his words or by his actions.\n\nIn law, apparent authority refers to the authority of an agent as it appears to others, and it can operate both to enlarge actual authority and to create authority where no actual authority exists. The law relating to companies and to ostensible authority are in reality only a sub-set of the rules relating to apparent authority and the law of agency generally, but because of the prevalence of the issue in relation to corporate law (companies, being artificial persons, are only ever able to act at all through their human agents), it has developed its own specific body of case law. However, some jurisdictions use the terms interchangeably.\n\nIn \"Freeman and Lockyer v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd\" [1964] 2 QB 480 the director in question managed the company's property and acted on its behalf and in that role employed the plaintiff architects to draw up plans for the development of land held by the company. The development ultimately collapsed and the plaintiffs sued the company for their fees. The company denied that the director had any authority to employ the architects. The court found that, while he had never been appointed as managing director (and therefore had no actual authority, express or implied) his actions were within his ostensible authority and the board had been aware of his conduct and had acquiesced in it. Diplock LJ identified four factors which must be present before a company can be bound by the acts of an agent who has no authority to do so; it must be shown that:\n\nThe agent must have been held out by someone with actual authority to carry out the transaction and an agent cannot hold himself out as having authority for this purpose. The acts of the company as principal must constitute a representation (express or by conduct) that the agent had a particular authority and must be reasonably understood so by the third party. In determining whether the principal had represented his agent as having such authority, the court has to consider the totality of the company's conduct. The most common form of holding out is permitting the agent to act in the conduct of the company's business, and in many cases this is inferred simply from allowing the agent to use a particular title, such as 'finance director'.\n\nThe apparent authority must not be undermined by any limitations on the company's capacity or powers found in the memorandum or articles of association, although in many countries, the effect of this is reduced by company law reforms abolishing or restricting the application of the \"ultra vires\" doctrine to companies. However, statutory reforms do not affect the general principle that a third party cannot rely upon ostensible authority where it is aware of some limitation which prevents the authority arising, or is put on enquiry as to the extent of an individual's authority. In some circumstances, the very nature of a transaction would be held to put a person on enquiry.\n\nThe rule in \"Turquand's\" case does not enable a third party to hold the company to an unauthorized transaction \"per se\". It allows a third party to assume that a transaction which is within the authority of the directors has been properly authorized, but it requires the third party to establish the fact of authority, actual or apparent, in the first place.\n\nIt is open to the principal to ratify an unauthorised agreement entered into by an agent. Ratification is the explicit or implicit action of the principal in agreeing, after the unauthorised act, to the act of the agent. Ratification by the principal causes such act to become binding on the third party. Note that without ratification by the principal, the third party is not bound to the unauthorized agreement created by an agent with no apparent authority, until the principal ratifies it. Whereas in the situation of an act done by an agent with ostensible (or apparent) authority, the principal and the third party are bound from the moment the agreement is consummated by the agent and third party.\n\n"}

{"id": "2173439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173439", "title": "Charlotte Area Transit System", "text": "Charlotte Area Transit System\n\nThe Charlotte Area Transit System, commonly referred to as CATS, is the public transit system in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States. It operates bus and rail service around the Charlotte metropolitan area. This includes a bus rapid transit line called the Sprinter, a light rail line called the LYNX Blue Line, and a streetcar line called CityLYNX Gold Line.\n\nJohn M. Lewis, Jr. was selected as the new CEO of CATS in July 2015 and started the job in mid-August 2015. Lewis replaced Carolyn Flowers, who had served in the role since 2010 and resigned to take a position at the Federal Transit Administration.\n\nBus transportation was provided by the Charlotte Department of Transportation under the branding known as Charlotte Transit, which was in existence from 1976 to 1999. (Charlotte Transit is not to be confused with Charlotte Area Transit System despite the similarity in name.) Most routes were local, with virtually no express service to outlying areas with the exception of two express routes. Service became inadequate to serve the rapidly growing population, especially in the southern and eastern portions, which began to be built up during 1990s. A referendum was passed in 1998 by Mecklenburg County citizens to approve a 1/2% sales tax to improve public transportation over the next few years. The move created the Metropolitan Transit Commission in 1999 to oversee improvements in Charlotte and nearby suburbs and bordering counties. It eventually led to consolidation of Charlotte Transit and MTC in 2000, forming the new Charlotte Area Transit System. Since then, more express routes were added to the edges of Mecklenburg County and some local bus service was expanded, especially to the fast-growing South Charlotte. On August 19, 2007 the Charlotte Observer revealed that mass transit on Charlotte's existing bus-only system has increased ridership by 66% since 1998, but its operating budget had increased by 170% after adjusting for inflation.\n\nCATS bus service serves Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, with service in Charlotte, Davidson, Huntersville, Cornelius, Matthews, Pineville, and Mint Hill.\n\nCATS operates local routes within the city of Charlotte, with the majority of those multiple-stop routes serving the Charlotte Transportation Center in Uptown. While crosstown service is scarce, other routes that do not serve Uptown mainly connect directly between LYNX rail stations and outlying neighborhoods. The transit system has since built three more transit centers to serve different parts of the city in the mid-2000s: the Eastland Community Transit Center in East Charlotte located near the now-closed Eastland Mall, the SouthPark Community Transit Center in South Charlotte located inside the parking garage of South Park Mall, and the Rosa Parks Community Transit Center in North Charlotte located near Johnson C. Smith University.\n\nExpress buses in the CATS system serve Union County, Concord, Gastonia, and Rock Hill, South Carolina.\n\nCATS also operates the Special Transportation Service (STS) which provides transportation to people with disabilities certified as eligible based on the Americans with Disabilities Act guidelines. STS provides service during the same times and in the same locations as the fixed route bus service.\n\nThe CATS system transports over 80,000 weekday riders across all of its services. Ridership for Fiscal Year 2010 reached over 24 million riders, a yearly amount not experienced in Charlotte since the late 1940s.\n\nCATS, in conjunction with NCDOT, operates an HOV lane on the expressway portion of Independence Boulevard. The HOV lane has been in operation since 1998.\n\nCATS operates with a fleet of 323 buses on 73 bus routes.\n\nOn February 22, 2006, the Charlotte Area Transit System announced that its rapid rail lines will be called the \"Lynx.\" The name fits in with the city's cat theme (the NFL team is the Carolina Panthers and the NBA team was known as the Charlotte Bobcats when the name was chosen); also, \"Lynx\" is a homophone of \"links\", and was mainly chosen because the light rail is about \"connectivity.\"\n\nThe rapid rail cars are , the colors of the Carolina Panthers. Gold will appear around the \"Lynx\" logo to tie in the history of the Charlotte region being home to the first major U.S. Gold Rush.\n\nThe original light rail system used 16 Siemens S70 train cars acquired for $50 million. In 2012, after 4 years of operation, the trains had to be repaired at the Siemens facility in California for an estimated cost of $400,000 each. The system is the only commuter rail system in the two Carolinas.\n\nOn November 24, 2007 the LYNX Blue Line opened. It runs 9.6 miles (15.5 km) between Uptown Charlotte and stops short of Pineville, using a railroad right-of-way paralleling South Boulevard in its entirety. The line has 15 stations. The line runs from its northern terminus in Uptown before traversing South End and paralleling South Boulevard to its southern terminus just north of Interstate 485 at the Pineville city limits. It became the first major rapid rail service of any kind in North Carolina, and began operating seventy years after a previous Charlotte streetcar system was disbanded in 1938, in favor of motorized bus transit.\n\nA extension of the present segment, originally referred to as the \"Northeast Corridor\", added 11 stations between Uptown and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Originally, completion of the extension was estimated to cost $1.12 billion, including an additional of track and two stations north of UNC Charlotte, ending at I-485 just south of Cabarrus County. However, due to the effects of the late 2000s – early 2010s recession, CATS voted to shorten the line and reduce the cost to $977 million.\n\nThe extension is intended to carry an estimated 24,500 weekday boardings by 2035 and serves four park and ride stations. City transportation and planning officials have predicted the new line could lead to the construction of 10,000 new housing units, as well as the development of nearly 4 million square feet of offices and 1.3 million square feet of retail space. On July 18, 2013, the official groundbreaking took place near the 9th Street Station, with the mayor of Charlotte Patsy Kinsey, N.C. Governor Pat McCrory and other officials in attendance. The extension opened on March 16, 2018.\n\nA streetcar line, the first segment of the CityLYNX Gold Line, commenced service on July 14, 2015. This section runs from the Charlotte Transportation Center / Arena station to Hawthorne Lane & 5th Street.\n\nGold Line is a planned 9.9-mile modern streetcar route running from Rosa Parks Community Transit Center, through Uptown Charlotte, down Central Avenue and terminating at Eastland Community Transit Center. A Federal Urban Circulator Grant was awarded in July 2010, allowing construction of phase one, a 1.5-mile segment between the Charlotte Transportation Center in Uptown and Presbyterian Hospital on Elizabeth Avenue. It opened on ; the second phase is scheduled to open in 2019.\n\nFuture expansion includes plans for light rail, streetcars and bus rapid transit along the corridors in the 2030 Transit Corridor System Plan adopted in 2006 by Metropolitan Transit Commission (MTC). \nOn May 6, 2013, a 30-member transit funding task force released a draft report in which they estimated it would cost $3.3 billion to build the remaining transit corridors, and $1.7 billion to operate and maintain the lines through 2024. To fund the build-out by sales taxes alone would require a 0.78 cent increase in the sales tax, which would need to be approved by the state General Assembly. The committee recommended any sales tax increase be limited to 0.5 cent and other methods used to raise funds; some suggested methods included:\n\nAlthough build-out of the entire system has been estimated for completion by 2030, by July 2015, the Charlotte Area Transit System reported it lacked the funds to support any future transit projects apart from the already budgeted 2.5-mile long Phase 2 segment of the CityLYNX Gold Line.\n\nTwo further segments of the CityLYNX Gold Line streetcar line, totaling , have been planned. Phase 2 will be using the 6 new Siemens S70 hybrid streetcars for $40 million and will replace the green and yellow Gomaco replica vehicles. The CityLYNX Gold Line Phase 2 project is set to break ground in January 2017 with revenue service beginning in 2020.\n\nWhen complete, the line will connect the University Park area of west Charlotte with Eastway Park area in east Charlotte by way of Uptown Charlotte, in a primarily east-west direction. Proposals call for its completion by 2023. CATS estimates that the completed route will have an average daily ridership of between 14,200 and 16,700 passengers by 2030. Groundbreaking for the initial 1.5-mile segment took place on December 12, 2012 in front of Presbyterian Hospital, with Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood, Mayor Foxx and other officials in attendance. The initial 1.5 mile (2.41 kilometer) segment (Phase 1) between Time Warner Cable Arena and Presbyterian Hospital opened on July 14, 2015. A further 2.5 mile (4.02 kilometer) segment (Phase 2) from the Charlotte Transportation Center/TWC Arena to French Street, and from Presbyterian Hospital to Hawthorne Lane has received funding. Construction of this segment is scheduled to begin by 2016, and to be open by late 2019. The third and final phase between Hawthorne Lane and Eastland CTC, and from French Street to Rosa Parks CTC, is scheduled for completion by 2023 at a cost of $231 million.\n\nThe Silver Line is a proposed rapid transit corridor to be operated as bus rapid transit (BRT) (or possibly as a light rail line) between the CPCC Levine Campus in Matthews and the proposed Gateway Station in Uptown Charlotte. Proposals call for it to be complete through Idlewild Road by 2022, Sardis Road North by 2024 and finally to CPCC Levine by 2026. As aligned, the completed line will have 16 stations and be completed at an estimated cost of $582 million. By October 2012, the MTC had decided in favor of a busway on interior lanes of the highway. In May 2013, however, a 30-member funding task force suggested a light rail line for the proposed route, at an estimated cost of $1.7 billion. So far, no definite plans to begin construction have been made.\n\nThe West Corridor is a proposed streetcar line, connecting Charlotte/Douglas International Airport in west Charlotte with Uptown Charlotte. Proposals call for completion by 2034. With a completion date over two decades away, in 2008 CATS announced enhanced bus service along this corridor to serve as a placeholder until the line can be constructed. Called \"Sprinter\", the service began in September 2009 and features fewer stops and timing similar to that of the future streetcar route.\n\nThe Red Line was a proposed commuter rail line. To be constructed along existing Norfolk Southern tracks, the line was intended to provide service to the towns of Huntersville, Cornelius, and Davidson in northern Mecklenburg County. The line was to be serviced by diesel multiple unit trains, and the southern terminus was the proposed Gateway Station in Uptown Charlotte. On October 17, 2012, the N.C. DOT, the Red Line Task Force, and CATS requested Norfolk Southern to conduct a study of the Red Line concept. As the Red Line would have utilized the NS O-Line between Charlotte and Mooresville, the study intended to determine if and how both freight and passenger services could use the same line while allowing normal freight services to continue. At a meeting of the task force on October 24, it was estimated the study could be initiated by late January 2013 and completed by early 2014, after which further feasibility studies and projections could be made. On June 25, 2014, following the completion and release of the feasibility study, CATS officials said the Red Line would be too costly and complicated to build. Several reasons were provided, including:\n\n\nDespite the negative assessments of the feasibility study, the Metropolitan Transit Commission, including the Red Line task force, has not taken any official steps to disband the project.\n\nIn July 2018, CATS suggested alternatives if the project was still not feasible. This was a series of meetings and surveys to get the opinion of the public about the line. In January 2019, CATS said that either a light rail or a commuter rail would be too expensive.\nCATS, alternatively would run buses along the I-77 Express Lanes.\n\n91 Charlotte Trolley operated within Uptown Charlotte from August 30, 1996 to June 28, 2010. The heritage trolley used vintage replica trolleys, serving 11 stations from Atherton Mill to 9th Street. Its operation was shared between the City of Charlotte and Charlotte Trolley Inc., a non-profit organization. The successes of the trolley led to the LYNX Blue Line light rail along the same right-of-way.\n\n\n\"Source: CATS 2010 Annual Report, National Transit Database'\n\n"}

It opened as Theatr Clwyd in 1976, but was known between 1998 and 2015 as Clwyd Theatr Cymru, before reverting to its original name.\n\nTheatr Clwyd opened in 1976. It forms part of the County Civic Centre at Mold (Yr Wyddgrug), being immediately adjacent to the County Hall (the administrative offices of the former administrative county of Clwyd, now the offices of the Flintshire County Council). It was built at the instigation of the former Flintshire County Council before that was abolished in the local government reorganisation of 1974 and replaced by Clwyd County Council.\n\nThe complex was opened by Queen Elizabeth II under the artistic direction of George Roman. Toby Robertson was the theatre's artistic director between 1985 and 1992. Robertson introduced several leading actors, including Vanessa Redgrave, Sir Michael Hordern and Timothy Dalton, to the theatre. Robertson was succeeded as artistic director by Helena Kaut-Howson, followed by Terry Hands from 1997 to 2015. Hands' successor, Tamara Harvey, was appointed in June 2015.\n\nHTV Wales had offices and a studio at the site from the late 1970s to the mid 1980s, but production was scaled back following the opening of the company's new studio complex at Culverhouse Cross in Cardiff. A small news operation remained in Mold until the late 1990s but closed when HTV moved its North Wales news operations to Colwyn Bay and Wrexham.\n\nThe name of the complex was changed to Clwyd Theatr Cymru in 1998 to reflect the reorganisation of local government at that time which abolished Clwyd as a county and brought Flintshire back into existence, although defined by different borders from the original ones. However, in 2015 the complex reverted to its original name.\n\nApart from hosting visiting theatre companies, Theatr Clwyd is home to Wales' major drama producing theatre company, under the artistic direction of Tamara Harvey, which stages their own productions throughout the year (including one of the longest-running pantomimes in the country) and also regularly performs on tour around Wales and the UK.\n\nTheatr Clwyd hosted the successful second stage performance of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\".\n\nThe complex contains five auditoria:\n\n\n"}

Its capital was at Hamdullahi.\n\nThe Fulas of the region had for centuries been the vassals of larger states, including the Mali Empire (13th-14th centuries), the Songhai Empire (15th century), the Moroccan pashas of Tomboctou (16th century), and the Bambara Empire at Ségou (17th century).\n\nBy the early 1800s, many of these larger states had declined in power and inspired by the recent Muslim uprisings of Usman dan Fodio in nearby Hausaland, preacher and social reformer Seku Amadu began efforts at increasing religious revivals in his homeland. Early struggle created the Massina leadership and in 1818 Seku Amadu led a jihad against the Bambara Empire in 1818. The empire expanded rapidly, taking Djenné in 1819 and establishing a new capital at Hamdullahi in 1820.\n\nAt the height of the Empire's power, a 10,000 man army was stationed in the city, and Seku Amadu ordered the construction of six hundred madrasas to further the spread of Islam. Alcohol, tobacco, music and dancing were banned in accordance with Islamic law, while a social welfare system provided for widows and orphans. A strict interpretation of Islamic injunctions against ostentation led Amadu to order the Great Mosque of Djenné to be abandoned, and all future mosques were ordered built with low ceilings and without decoration or minarets.\n\nOne of the most enduring accomplishments was a code regulating the use of the inland Niger delta region by Fula cattle herders and diverse farming communities.\n\nIn 1825, Seku Amadu conquered Timbuktu. He died in 1845, leaving control of the Massina Empire to his son, Amadu II, who was succeeded by his son Amadu III.\n\nIn 1862, Omar Tall of Toucouleur launched an attack on the Massina from his newly secured base at Ségou. After a series of bloody battles, he entered Hamdullahi on March 16, leveling it. Amadu III was captured and put to death. Though resistance briefly continued under Amadu III's brother Ba Lobbo, the destruction marked the effective end of the Massina Empire.\n\n\n\n"}

His father was a prominent figure in the legal profession who served as an assistant District attorney, before working as a criminal trial lawyer. In 1920 George Martin became a county court judge and presided over cases involving some of the notorious Murder Inc criminals.\n\nMartin's mother, Maud Ainsworth, was born in Chicago to Joseph Ainsworth and Annie Young. She was one of several children born of that marriage, but was put up for adoption. She was adopted by her uncle and aunt James McIntyre (theatrical actor) (1857–1937) a vaudevillian (one partner of the black-face duo, \"Thomas Heath and Jim McIntyre\"), and Emma Maude Young (1862–1935), a dancer and balladeer (known on stage as \"Maude Clifford\" and \"Maud Clifton\").\n\nMartin was raised in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, and was the youngest of six children. In his earliest years the family lived on Macdonough Street, and then from 1930 onwards on Bainbridge Street, Brooklyn. In the mid-1940s he attended The Stony Brook School where he obtained his high school diploma.\n\nDr. Martin held four earned degrees including a Master of Arts Degree in Philosophy from New York University, where he was a student alongside television evangelist D. James Kennedy. Kennedy confirmed the fact that Martin had completed all of the coursework for his doctorate, with the exception of his dissertation. He subsequently obtained a Ph.D. in 1976 from California Coast University, which was accredited by the state of California when the degree was awarded. (see Controversies below)\n\nMartin's career as an apologist began at the age of fifteen after being baptized in Hegemen Chapel at The Stony Brook School (Stony Brook, NY). While in college and graduate school, he often skipped eating during his lunch hours to answer a variety of tough questions about the Bible and the Christian faith while standing on the corner of Wall Street and Broadway, in New York City. Martin has indicated in various book dedications and in audio recorded lectures how he was mentored by Frank Gaebelein (Headmaster, The Stony Brook School), Wilbur Smith (1894–1976) (author of the apologetic text \"Therefore Stand\"), and the Presbyterian Bible teacher Donald Grey Barnhouse (1895–1960).\n\nMartin's relationship with Barnhouse as his mentor grew over the years, and he was appointed as a regular columnist to \"Eternity\" magazine (1955–60). Barnhouse's support for Martin's research and teaching abilities resulted in the reassessment of Seventh Day Adventist theology, raising the profile of his early ministry in the Evangelical movement. He also worked for a time as a research associate for the National Association of Evangelicals.\n\nMartin was ordained as a minister of the Regular Baptists in 1951, but this was revoked in 1953 owing to his remarriage. However, Martin met with the key pastor involved in this revocation and a restoration agreement was apparently reached, as Martin began marrying couples on television and continuing in public pastoral roles with the full knowledge of the Baptist denomination. His status as a minister has been the subject of much controversy but his daughter, Jill Martin Rische, has made more information available that puts much of the controversy to rest. Walter Martin served as a pastor in various churches in New York and New Jersey in the 1950s and 1960s. He also became a regular teacher of Bible study classes at Barnhouse's Church in New York City. In later years Martin would serve as a preacher and Bible teacher at Melodyland Christian Center and then at Newport Mesa Christian Center in California.\n\nPerhaps the greatest public controversy of his early career arose from his studies of Seventh-day Adventist theology. From its earliest days until the 1950s, the Seventh-day Adventist Church was regarded by Evangelical Christians and mainstream Protestants as either an extreme sect or heretical cult. Martin had initially accepted the prevailing Protestant opinion about the heretical status of the Seventh-day Adventists. He indicated his opposition to Adventist teachings in a brief paragraph in the inaugural edition of his book \"The Rise of the Cults,\" published in 1955.\n\nHowever, he reversed his views after a series of interviews with various leaders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and on reading Adventist literature. Martin reported his initial findings to Barnhouse, and between 1955-56 a series of small conferences were held, with Barnhouse and Martin meeting Adventist leaders like T. E. Unruh and LeRoy Froom. Barnhouse and Martin then published some of their findings in a series of articles that appeared in \"Eternity Magazine\" between September and November 1956. The standpoint taken by Barnhouse and Martin was that Adventists were largely orthodox on central doctrines, but heterodox on lesser doctrines, and so could be classified as belonging in the Evangelical camp. Martin later expanded his position in his 1960 book-length treatment, \"The Truth About Seventh-day Adventism\". Martin's book carried an explanatory foreword by Barnhouse and a statement from H. W. Lowe who was the chairman of the Biblical Study and Research Group of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. While Lowe did not agree with Martin's criticism of the church's distinctive doctrines he nonetheless commended the book for providing a \"fair and accurate statement of Adventist teachings.\" A committee of Adventist leaders themselves wrote and published a companion book, \"Seventh-day Adventists Answer Questions on Doctrine\", in 1957. While many Adventists welcomed the overtures of Barnhouse and Martin, there were other Adventists who questioned the position taken by church leaders in the volume \"Questions on Doctrine\".\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s Evangelical opinions were divided over the Martin-Barnhouse stance on the Adventists. Some, like E. Schuyler English, supported Martin, some such as John Gerstner urged a sober and fair hearing, while others, such as Louis Talbot, J. K. van Baalen, Harold Lindsell and Anthony Hoekema, opposed his view. As the controversy ensued among Evangelicals Martin found it was necessary to restate and defend his position and to reply to his critics. To that end Martin reproduced much of the text of his 1960 book, together with critical replies in an appendix \"The Puzzle of Seventh-day Adventism\" in his 1965 textbook \"The Kingdom of the Cults\". Martin later updated the appendix in the 1985 edition of \"Kingdom of the Cults\", and since his death the editors of the posthumous editions of 1997 and 2003 have continued to update it.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1965 Martin enjoyed a relationship with Zondervan publishers where he was appointed as director of cult apologetics publications. During this period Zondervan released several publications about cults under his direction, with at least eight books and four booklets written by Martin. His earliest countercult books included \"Jehovah of the Watchtower\", \"The Christian Science Myth\", \"The Christian and the Cults\" and \"The Maze of Mormonism\".\n\nIn his first handbook, \"The Rise of the Cults\", he wrote about Jehovah's Witnesses, the Theosophical Society, Mormonism, Christian Science, the Unity School of Christianity, and Father Divine, with an exhortation to the church to treat the cults as an important mission-field. Most of the contents of his earliest books reappeared in his major textbook \"The Kingdom of the Cults\", which was first released in 1965.\n\nMartin's primary approach to assessing cults was to focus on what he saw as doctrinal issues, particularly those concerning the person, nature and work of Jesus Christ. Martin emphasized research and quoted directly from the teachings of the opposing denominations; which he called cults, challenging their claims to Christianity by pointing out what he saw as Biblical errors in their theology. (Jill Martin Rische, eldest daughter of Dr. Walter Martin, www.waltermartin.com).\n\nMartin built a reputation as an authority figure on cults based upon integrity. His role as a columnist in \"Eternity\" magazine allowed him the freedom to address other topics such as basic Christian doctrines, the theology of Karl Barth, the problem of alcoholism, and reviewing books. His basic approach in apologetics was that of an evidentialist.\n\nThroughout his writing career Martin had articles published in other periodicals including \"Christianity Today\", \"United Evangelical Action\", \"The Christian Librarian\", \"Christian Life\", \"Christian Research Newsletter\", \"Logos Journal\", \"Moody Monthly\", and \"Our Hope\".\n\nIn 1960 Martin established the Christian Research Institute in New Jersey, and then in 1974 relocated it to Southern California. In its earliest years Martin's colleagues who were associated with Christian Research Institute included Walter Bjorck, James Bjornstad, Floyd Hamilton, and Shildes Johnson, many of whom went on to publish countercult books.\n\nThrough this para-church organisation Martin built up a reference library of primary source material, and sought to train Christians in the art of apologetics and evangelism. He developed a bureau of speakers, and from the early 1960s conceived of the need for a computerized data base of apologetic information. Martin's prescient advocacy of using computer technology for apologetic purposes led to a major conference, the All-Europe Conference on Computer Technique for Theological Research held in Austria in September 1968. This became the subject of the book \"Computers, Cultural Change and the Christ\", which was written by Martin's friend and colleague John Warwick Montgomery.\n\nIn 1978 he established a ministry periodical known as \"Forward\", which was redesigned in 1987 as \"Christian Research Journal\". Martin mentored several figures who have become prominent apologists in the Christian countercult movement including Craig Hawkins, Bob and Gretchen Passantino, Elliot Miller, John Weldon, Kenneth Samples, Ron Rhodes, Rich Poll, Ron Carlson, Paul Carden, and Robert M Bowman Jr. Many of the people who have established ministries in the Christian countercult movement regard Martin as the father of the Christian Counter-cult Movement. One indicator of the high esteem in which he was held is that at least twelve books have been dedicated to him. Scores of ministries on cults and apologetics have also begun as a result of Dr. Martin and his ministry.\n\nMartin was also a radio broadcaster who began this side of his ministry on Barnhouse's program. In the mid-1960s Martin regularly appeared as a guest panelist on \"The Long John Nebel Show\", and then founded his own program known as \"The Bible Answer Man.\" Between the mid-1960s until his death in 1989 Martin debated in public various non-Christians such as atheist author/activist Madalyn Murray O'Hair and Hugh Schonfield, theologians of Liberal Christianity like Thomas J. J. Altizer and Bishop John Shelby Spong, and new religious commentators like Roy Masters. He appeared many times on the John Ankerberg television show debating advocates of Freemasonry, the Bahá'í Faith, and other groups.\n\nIn the earliest years of his ministry Martin traveled frequently with Billy Graham and World Vision Founder Bob Pierce, addressing thousands in open air church meetings about the theological problems posed by the cults. Martin always emphasized the importance of analysis and primary source materials in determining the true beliefs of groups like Christian Science, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-day Adventists, Mormonism, Spiritualists, Father Divine, Unity School of Christianity and Herbert W. Armstrong's Worldwide Church of God. In 1958 he spoke throughout East Asia and in Ghana, and in 1961 in Northern and Western Europe.\n\nThe popularity of Martin's ministry coincided with the Jesus People movement of the early 1970s and the rise of the countercultural interest in East Asian religions and esoteric pathways. As occult interests surfaced in the counterculture, and also as other religious movements and groups like the Hare Krishna, Unification Church, and Children of God emerged, Martin became a much sought after speaker for curious and fearful Christians.\n\nMartin utilised the new technology of cassette tapes, and disseminated many of his public lectures about apologetics questions and cultic groups to thousands worldwide. Several albums were released on \"The World of the Cults\", \"The World of the Occult\", \"The New Cults\", \"How To Witness to Jehovah's Witnesses\", and \"How to Witness to Mormons\". Other albums tackled general apologetics \"To Every Man An Answer\", and topical problems such as abortion, homosexuality and women's liberation (\"Martin Speaks Out\"). He later appeared in a series of six films produced by Vision House called \"Martin Speaks Out on the Cults\".\n\nDuring the 1980s Martin spoke in churches and para-church conferences in Australia and around the world, Brazil, Kenya and New Zealand. His final book dealt with New Age spirituality.\n\nMartin maintained a part-time role as a lecturer in various liberal arts and bible colleges including The King's College, Melodyland School of Theology in Anaheim, California, and was for many years a board member of Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. In 1980 he joined John Warwick Montgomery in promoting apologetics through the Master of Arts program at the Simon Greenleaf School of Law.\n\nIn the 1980s, Martin was involved in critical debates over the positive confession success theology (also called Word of Faith) of Christian charismatic teachers such as Kenneth Copeland and Kenneth Hagin. While Martin was critical of these teachers' claims concerning their views of Christ, healing, faith, and prosperity, he believed in the perpetuity of charismatic spiritual gifts in the Church. To that end, Martin presented his positive appraisal of spiritual gifts in several audio lectures (waltermartin.com), and by editing with chapter end-notes, a fresh reprint edition of 19th century evangelist Dwight L. Moody's book \"Secret Power.\"\n\nSome opponents have made claims that Martin did not have a valid doctorate. Mr and Mrs Robert Brown of Arizona, two Latter-Day Saints, have stated that California Western University, now known as California Coast University (CCU) was not accredited at the time the degree was awarded. In addition some opponents of Martin claim he purchased his doctorate from CCU, which they claim was a degree mill. It must be noted that Martin completed all the coursework at New York University, which is also an accredited school. Furthermore, California Coast University also offers fully accredited programmes, being accredited by the State of California since 1974. Such approval is currently granted by the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education. It, however, received national accreditation only in 2005, from the Distance Education and Training Council (DETC). It obtained this status after a study by the US General Accounting Office (GAO), which sought to provide national accreditation to schools that offered high quality education, which concluded that CCU was never a diploma mill and never committed wrongdoing.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2173506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173506", "title": "David Ochterlony", "text": "David Ochterlony\n\nMajor-general Sir David Ochterlony, 1st Baronet of Pitforthy, 1st Baronet of Ochterlony (12 February 175815 July 1825) was a Massachusetts-born general of the East India Company in British India. He held the powerful post of British Resident to the Mughal court at Delhi.\n\nDavid Ochterlony was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the eldest son of Captain David Ochterlony (also Ochterloney) and his wife, Katherine Tyler. His father was born into an ancient family in Forfarshire, Scotland, and his mother was born in Boston to settlers of English and Welsh descent. His mother was the niece of Sir William Pepperrell. He had two younger brothers, Gilbert and Alexander, and a sister, Catherine. Captain Ochterlony died in the Saint Vincent, West Indies, in 1765, after which his widow moved back to England and his mother remarried to Sir Isaac Heard, Garter King-of-Arms. He attended the Boston Latin School and Dummer Charity School (now known as The Governor's Academy) in nearby Byfield, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1777, at age 18, Ochterlony went as a cadet to India. In February 1778 he was commissioned into the Bengal Native Infantry as an ensign and that same September was advanced to lieutenant. In June 1782 whilst serving in the Second Anglo-Mysore War he was wounded and taken prisoner. He remained in captivity for the duration of the war, and was only released when peace resumed in 1784. He thereafter returned to Calcutta and in recognition of his eminent service during the war was conferred with the appointment of Judge Advocate-General for one of the divisions in the army. In 1796 he was promoted to Captain and in 1800 to Major. \n\nIn early 1803 he was appointed Lieutenant General and accompanied Lord Lake throughout the Second Anglo-Maratha War. He was present at the battles of Koil, Aligarh and Delhi. Following the battle of Delhi he was appointed Resident at Delhi. In 1804, he defended the city with a very inadequate force against an attack by Yashwantrao Holkar which earned him the highest approbation from the Commander-in-Chief. He was thereafter given the command at Allahabad and then commanded a force on the banks of the Sutlej to check the expansion of the Sikhs. He was promoted to Major-general in 1814.\n\nOn the outbreak of the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1814 he was given the command of one of four converging columns. His was regarded as the only truly successful column throughout the war. He was subsequently promoted to the command of the main force in its advance on Kathmandu, and outmanoeuvring the Gurkhas by a flank march at the Kourea Ghat Pass, brought the war to a successful conclusion and obtained the signature of the Treaty of Sugauli, which dictated the subsequent relations of the British with Nepal. In return for his services during the war, he became a Knight Commander of the Bath, the first time the honour had been conferred on an officer of the British military in India and was granted a baronetcy in November 1815. The following month he was given a pension of £1,000 per annum. In December 1816 he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.\n\nIn 1818 he was appointed Resident in Rajpootana, with which the Residency at Delhi was subsequently combined. In the Pindari War between 1818-19 he commanded the Rajputana column and made a separate agreement with Amir Khan. He detached him from the Pindaris, and then, interposing his own force between the two main divisions of the enemy, brought the war to an end without an engagement. He was afterwards made Resident and Political Agent of Malwa, thus having the entire superintendency of the affairs of central India. During this period he encountered and engaged in an ongoing personal feud with James Tod, which was based most likely on the power politics within the hierarchy of the East India Company.\n\nWhen Durjan Sal revolted in 1825 against Balwant Singh, the infant Raja of the Princely state of Bharatpur, Ochterlony acting on his own accord supported the young Raja by proclamation and ordered out a force to support him. However, the Governor-General of India, Lord Amherst, repudiated these proceedings and ordered the army to return. Ochterlony, who was bitterly chagrined by this rebuff, resigned his office, and retired to Delhi. He was to be replaced by his good friend Sir Charles Metcalfe. The feeling that the confidence which his length of service merited had not been given him by the governor-general is said to have accelerated his death, and he died at Meerut in July 1825. He is interred in St. John's Church in Meerut.\nThe Ochterlony column at Calcutta commemorated his name, though it has since been rededicated.\n\nAs the official British Resident at Delhi, David Ochterlony adopted and thoroughly embraced Indo-Persian culture of Mughals. He was reputed to have thirteen Indian concubines (as seen by the British) or wives (as seen by others). Every evening, he used to take all thirteen of his wives on a promenade around the walls of the Red Fort, each on the back of her own elephant.\n\nThe most prominent among Ochterlony's women was \"Bebee Mahruttun Mubarak ul Nissa Begum\", Nicknamed \"\"Generallee Begum\"\", she was Ochterlony's favorite and the mother of his youngest children. As such, she took clear precedence over the rest of the household. She was considered to be a devout Muslim, having once applied for leave to make the \"hajj\" to Mecca.\n\nAlthough much younger than Ochterlony, Mubarak was seen as the dominant personality in the relationship. This led one observer to remark that \"making Sir David the Commissioner of Delhi was the same as making Generallee Begum\". Another observer remarked that \"Ochterlony's mistress is the mistress now of everyone within the walls. As a result of her influence, Ochterlony considered raising his children as Muslims, and when his two daughters by Mubarak Begum had grown up, he adopted a child from the family of the Nawabs of Loharu, one of the leading Muslim families of Delhi. Raised by Mubarak, the girl went on to marry her cousin, a nephew of the famous Urdu poet Mirza Ghalib.\n\nMubarak even seems to have set herself up as a power in her own right and to have formed her own independent foreign policy. At one point, it was reported that \"Mubarak Begum, alias Generalee Begum, fills the [Delhi] papers with accounts of the \"Nizars\" and \"Khiluts\" [gifts and dresses of honour] given and taken by her in her transactions with the \"Vacquils\" [ambassadors of the different Indian powers] - an extraordinary liberty, if true.\"\n\nHowever, in spite of all her power and high status, Mubarak Begum was widely unpopular among the British and the Mughals alike. She offended the British by calling herself \"Lady Ochterlony\" and on the other hand, also offended the Mughals by awarding herself the title \"\"Qudsia Begum\"\", a title previously reserved for the Emperor's mother. After Ochterlony's death, she inherited \"Mubarak Bagh\", an Anglo-Mughal garden tomb Ochterlony had built in the north of Old Delhi, but her intense unpopularity combined with her background as a dancing girl ensured that no Mughal gentleman would use her structure. To this date, the tomb is still referred to by the local inhabitants of the old city as the \"\"Rundi ki Masjid\"\" (the Whore's Mosque).\n\nOchterlony had at least six natural (illegitimate) children, by two or more of his concubines:\n"}

He was the mentor of Doctor Strange and was his predecessor as Sorcerer Supreme.\n\nThe character was voiced by Michael Ansara in the 1978 television film \"Dr. Strange\". Tilda Swinton portrayed a female Celtic version of the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films \"Doctor Strange\" (2016) and \"\" (2019).\n\nThe Ancient One first appeared in \"Strange Tales\" #110 (cover-dated July 1963), and was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.\n\nThe character has appeared in multiple Marvel Comics graphic novels. \"Doctor Strange: Season One\" (January 2, 2012, by Greg Pak and illustrated by Emma Rios), \"Doctor Strange - Marvel Masterworks Volume 1\", and \"Doctor Strange: From the Marvel Vault #1\" (June 15, 2011, by Roger Stern and illustrated by Neil Vokes).\n\nThe character who would eventually become the Ancient One was born in Kamar-Taj, \"a hidden land high in the Himalayas\", more than 500 years ago. He spent his youth as a peaceful farmer, until his friend Kaluu discovered the power of magic. When Kaluu shared this knowledge of the mystic arts with the Ancient One, the two disagreed on how they would use the powers. The Ancient One wished to turn their village into a utopia, while Kaluu desired power and conquest over nearby villages.\n\nThe Ancient One and Kaluu agreed to cast a spell, eliminating sickness, disease, and age from Kamar-Taj. Subsequently, the villagers, under Kaluu's mind-control spell, crown him king of the village. The Ancient One attempts to stop Kaluu, but the village of Kamar-Taj is wiped out as a result of their conflict. As a result, Kaluu is banished to an alternate dimension and the Ancient One is stripped of his immortality. Nonetheless, the Ancient One ages far more slowly than any regular human.\n\nThe Ancient One settles in the Himalaya Mountains and builds a palace as his home, together with an order of monks that he forms for his own protection and support. In a tournament organized by the sorcerer Aged Genghis, the Ancient One wins the title of Earth's Sorcerer Supreme and subsequently takes on responsibility for a student, who later becomes Mister Jip. The student is then banished from the Ancient One's home when the student is discovered by his master to have been studying forbidden books of black magic to increase his own power.\n\nAs he ages and weakens, the Ancient One seeks out another student and eventually approaches Anthony Ludgate Druid, a psychiatrist with mystical talents. Posing as the High Lama, the Ancient One trains Druid to become Doctor Druid. \n\nAfter a car crash, Stephen Strange seeks assistance from the Ancient One to cure the nerve damage in his hands, only to angrily refuse when offered to be the Ancient One's apprentice instead. The Ancient One then accepts Strange as a student when Strange discovers Mordo and Dormammu had become collaborators and that Mordo had perpetrated an attack against the Ancient One. Unaware of the Ancient One's awareness of the threat against him, Strange confronts Mordo about his treachery only to be bound by restraining spells to prevent him from warning the Ancient One or physically attacking Mordo. Alarmed at these developments and concerned for the old man's safety, Strange concludes that the only way to help him would be to learn magic himself to gain a hope of stopping Mordo. When Strange is driven by this selfless purpose, he approaches the Ancient One to accept his offer. The pleased mentor promptly frees Strange from his restraints and explains the whole situation.\n\nMordo leaves the palace shortly afterwards and Stephen becomes the Ancient One's successor under the name Doctor Strange. The Ancient One often assists Strange. But when the extra-dimensional monster Shuma-Gorath tries to invade Earth through the Ancient One's mind while the latter is in the Crypts of Kaa-U, the Ancient One prompts Strange to destroy the portion of the Ancient One's mind in which the ego, or sense of self, exists. While such action blocks the way for Shuma-Gorath, trapping him within the Ancient One's mind, the Ancient One's physical body is also destroyed. The Ancient One's corporeal existence is over, but his soul subsequently achieves transcendence, becoming one with the universe and Eternity. Strange then inherits the Ancient One's title as Sorcerer Supreme.\n\nThe Ancient One demonstrates his existence following the death of his physical body by manifesting himself as an avatar of Eternity, intervening in a struggle between Doctor Strange and Eternity. He also briefly regains his corporeal form, during which time he lives as an alcohol-dependent derelict in the Bowery section of Manhattan, New York, United States. He resumed his oneness with the universe upon Doctor Strange's defeat of the Creators.\n\nDuring Hercules' journey to the underworld in the \"Dark Reign\" storyline, the Ancient One was seen in Erebus gambling for his resurrection. As explained to Hercules, the afterlife has become a shambles, due to various entities not paying attention.\n\nDuring a demonic invasion of New York via the Eye of Agamotto, Iron Fist finds himself transferred into a white void when he comes in contact with the Eye, resulting in a face-to-face confrontation with a form that appears to be the Ancient One; the form claims that both he and a currently-unidentified associate are responsible for the demonic invasion due to his anger at Strange's recent \"failures\". However, a casual comment by Spider-Man prompts Strange, Doctor Voodoo, and Daimon Hellstrom to realize that they are actually dealing with Agamotto himself, as the Ancient One's demands for the Eye defy everything that was previously told to Strange about how the Eye is passed from one sorcerer to another.\n\nAfter Doctor Strange defeats Daniel Drumm, using dark magic that does not control him, the Ancient One's spirit appears and speaks to Doctor Strange:\n\nThe Ancient One possessed the ability to manipulate the forces of magic for a vast number of effects and was able to tap into extra-dimensional energy by invoking entities or objects of power, existing in dimensions tangential to those of the Earth, through the recitation of spells. The Ancient One was capable of astral projection, levitation, interdimensional teleportation, and a large number of other effects. However, in his extreme old age, the Ancient One was unable to perform any major feats of sorcery without placing great physical strain upon himself.\n\nThe Ancient One also possessed a variety of mystical objects, such as the Book of the Vishanti, the Orb, Amulet, and Eye of Agamotto, and devices gathered throughout his lifetime. After he unified with Eternity, the extent of the Ancient One's powers ceased to be known.\n\nIn J. Michael Straczynski's 2005 \"Strange\" series, Doctor Strange's origin was adapted. In this series, the Ancient One is an ancient magician physically frail from old age, but spiritually and psychically powerful. He is depicted as an old, bald man with a long white beard and moustache dressed in a white robe.\n\nIn the \"Dr. Strange: Season One\" graphic novel, the Ancient One is presented as more sociable. He makes self-deprecating jokes and forms friendships with outsiders.\n\nTilda Swinton portrays the Ancient One in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The character is depicted as an androgynous Celtic, to reflect the mystery of the character.\n\n\nThe Ancient One appears in \"\", voiced by Michael Yama.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the country's largest river and most important commercial waterway. Originating from the confluence of the N'mai and Mali rivers, it flows relatively straight North-South before emptying through the Irrawaddy Delta into the Andaman Sea. Its drainage basin of about covers a large part of Burma. After Rudyard Kipling's poem, it is sometimes referred to as 'The Road to Mandalay'.\n\nAs early as the sixth century, the river was used for trade and transport. Having developed an extensive network of irrigation canals, the river became important to the British Empire after it had colonized Burma. The river is still as vital today, as a considerable amount of (export) goods and traffic moves by river. Rice is produced in the Irrawaddy Delta, irrigated by water from the river.\n\nIn 2007, Myanmar's military dictatorship signed an agreement for the construction of seven hydroelectric dams, yielding a total 13,360 MW, in the N'mai and Mali Rivers, including the 3600 MW Myitsone Dam at the confluence of both rivers. Environmental organisations have raised concerns about the ecological impacts on the river's biodiverse ecosystems. Animals potentially impacted include the endangered Irrawaddy dolphin and the critically endangered Ganges shark.\n\nThe native Kachin people named the river Mali-Nmai-Hka. The Burmese name of Irrawaddy is derived from Pali. \"Irāvatī\" or \"Airāvatī\" (Pali \"Erāvatī\") was the Pali version of the name of the elephant mount of Sakka, and Indra in Hinduism. Saka is an important deva in Buddhism. Elephants were often a symbol for water and was used as the name for several others rivers, such as the Achiravati.\n\nThe Irrawaddy gives its name to the Irrawaddy dolphin (\"Orcaella brevirostris\"), which is found in the lower reaches of the river and known to help fishermen who practice cast-net fishing. Though called Irrawaddy dolphin, it has been also found in the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe Irrawaddy River bisects Myanmar from north to south and empties through the nine-armed Irrawaddy Delta into the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe Irrawaddy River arises by the confluence of the N'mai (Nam Gio) and Mali Rivers in Kachin State. Both the N'mai and Mali Rivers find their sources in the Himalayan glaciers of Upper Burma near 28° N. The eastern branch of the two, N'mai, is the larger and rises in the Languela Glacier north of Putao. It is unnavigable because of the strong current whereas the smaller western branch, the Mali river, is navigable, despite a few rapids. Herefore, the Mali river is still called by the same name as the main river by locals. The controversial Myitsone Dam is currently under construction at the convergence of these rivers.\n\nThe town of Bhamo, about south of the Mali and N'mai river confluence, is the northernmost city reachable by boat all the year round although during the monsoons most of the river cannot be used by boats. The city of Myitkyina lies south of the confluence and can be reached during the dry season.\n\nBetween Myitkyina and Mandalay, the Irrawaddy flows through three well-marked defiles:\nThis sheet of lava is the Singu Plateau, a volcanic field from the Holocene. This field consists of magma from the fissure vents and covers an area of about . The plateau is also known as Letha Taung.\n\nLeaving this plateau at Kyaukmyaung, the river follows a broad, open course through the central dry zone – the ancient cultural heartland – where large areas consist of alluvial flats. From Mandalay (the former capital of the kingdom of Myanmar), the river makes an abrupt westward turn before curving southwest to unite with the Chindwin River, after which it continues in a southwestern direction. It is probable that the upper Irrawaddy originally flowed south from Mandalay, discharging its water through the present Sittaung River to the Gulf of Martaban, and that its present westward course is geologically recent. Below its confluence with the Chindwin, the Irrawaddy continues to meander through the petroleum producing city of Yenangyaung, below which it flows generally southward. In its lower course, between Minbu and Pyay, it flows through a narrow valley between forest-covered mountain ranges—the ridge of the Arakan Mountains to the west and that of the Pegu Yoma Mountains to the east.\n\nThe delta of the Irrawaddy begins about above Hinthada (Henzada) and about from its curved base, which faces the Andaman Sea. The westernmost distributary of the delta is the Pathein (Bassein) River, while the easternmost stream is the Yangon River, on the left bank of which stands Myanmar's former capital city, Yangon (Rangoon). Because the Yangon River is only a minor channel, the flow of water is insufficient to prevent Yangon Harbour from silting up, and dredging is necessary. The relief of the delta's landscape is low but not flat. The soils consist of fine silt, which is replenished continuously by fertile alluvium carried downstream by the river. As a result of heavy rainfall varying from a year in the delta, and the motion and sediment load of the river, the delta surface extends into the Andaman Sea at a rate of about per year.\n\nDue to monsoonal rains, which occur between mid-May and mid-October, the volume of the Irrawaddy and its tributaries varies greatly throughout the year. In summer, the melting of the snow and glaciers in Northern Burma add to the volume. The average discharge near the head of the delta is between a high of and a low of per second. The discharge can be as high as 40,393 cubic meter per second in rainy season. Over a year, the discharge averages . Further North, at Sagaing, the hydrograph shows a 38% decrease in discharge compared to where the river enters the delta. it also silted up around 278 tons of sand every year.\n\nVariation between high and low waterlevel is also great. At Mandalay and Prome, a range of has been measured between low-water level and floodlevel respectively. Because of the monsoonal character of the rain, the highest point is recorded in August, the lowest in February.\n\nThis variation in water level makes it necessary for ports along the river to have separate landing ports for low- and high-water. Still, low water levels have caused problems for ports along the river, as in the Bamaw–Mandalay–Pyay sectors, the shallowest point is as shallow as .\n\nWithin the basin, the average population density is 79 people/km. For these people, the river supply amounts to 18,614 m per person per year.\n\nCollectively, the modern Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy) and Thanlwin (Salween) rivers deliver >600 Mt/yr of sediment to the sea. Most recent stuy shows: 1) There is little modern sediment accumulating on the shelf immediately off the Ayeyarwady River mouths. In contrast, a major mud wedge with a distal depocenter, up to 60 m in thickness, has been deposited seaward in the Gulf of Martaban, extending to ~130 m water depth into the Martaban Depression. Further, 2) There is no evidence showing that modern sediment has accumulated or is transported into the Martaban Canyon; 3) There is a mud drape/blanket wrapping around the narrow western Myanmar Shelf in the eastern Bay of Bengal. The thickness of the mud deposit is up to 20 m nearshore and gradually thins to the slope at −300 m water depth, and likely escapes into the deep Andaman Trench; 4) The estimated total amount of Holocene sediments deposited offshore is ~1290 × 109 tons. If we assume this has mainly accumulated since the middle Holocene highstand (~6000 yr BP) like other major deltas, the historical annual mean depositional flux on the shelf would be 215 Mt/yr, which is equivalent to ~35% of the modern Ayeyarwady-Thanlwin rivers derived sediments; 5) Unlike other large river systems in Asia, such as the Yangtze and Mekong, this study indicates a bi-directional transport and depositional pattern controlled by the local currents that are influenced by tides, and seasonally varying monsoons winds and waves.\n\nNo complete and precise list of all the fish in the Irrawaddy river basin currently exists, but in 1996 it was estimated that there are about 200 species. In 2008, it was estimated that the Irrawaddy ecoregion is home to 119–195 species of fish found nowhere else in the world (endemic). Several new species of fish have been described from the Irrawaddy river basin in recent years (for example, the cyprinid \"Danio htamanthinus\" in 2016 and the stone loach \"Malihkaia aligera\" in 2017), and it is likely that undescribed species remain.\n\nAmong the most well-known species in the river is the Irrawaddy dolphin (\"Orcaella brevirostris\"), a euryhaline species of oceanic dolphin with a high and rounded forehead, lacking a beak. It is found in discontinuous sub-populations near sea coasts and in estuaries and rivers in parts of the Bay of Bengal and South-East Asia.\n\nAlong the North-South course of the Irrawaddy River, a number of notably different ecoregions can be distinguished.\n\nThe streams of the Nmai and Mali that form the Irrawaddy originate in high and remote mountains near the border with Tibet. This part of Myanmar, which extends north from Myitkyina and the Irrawaddy confluence, lies entirely outside the tropics. Rain falls at all seasons of the year, but mostly in the summer. The valleys and lower hill ranges are covered with tropical and subtropical evergreen rainforest instead of monsoon (deciduous) forest. This region is characterised by subtropical and temperate forests of oak and pine are found at elevations above . This evergreen forest passes into sub-tropical pine forest at about feet. Above , are forests of rhododendrons, and that in turn into evergreen conifer forest above feet.\n\nThe Irrawaddy river basin covers an approximate area of 255 . The Central Basin consists of the valley of the middle Irrawaddy and lower Chindwin. It lies within the 'dry zone' and consists almost entirely of plains covered with the teak-dominated Irrawaddy moist deciduous forests ecoregion, which surrounds dry forest patches in drier areas. The central basin receives little rain (ave 650mm per year) although it does flood quickly during the July–October storms. The one meteorological factor which does not vary greatly, and which is the most important for plant life, is atmospheric humidity. This is always high, except in the winter in certain localities. Humidity usually does not fall below 75% and is 90% or more for long periods during summer. Another feature is the prevalent southerly summer winds which erode the soil of the basin.\n\nThe natural habitats of this central zone have been much altered for farming and there are few protected areas.\n\nThe predominant trees of the drier patches are the thorny \"Terminalia oliveri\" and the hardwood dahat teak (\"Tectona hamiltoniana\") with stands of Indaing (\"Dipterocarpus tuberculatus\") which is cut for timber. The wildlife includes many birds, small mammals and reptiles such as the huge Burmese python. However, most of the large animals including the tiger have been hunted out or seen their habitats disappear.\n\nThe Irrawaddy River and its tributaries flow into the Andaman Sea through the Irrawaddy Delta. This ecoregion consists of mangroves and freshwater swamp forests. It is an extremely fertile area because of the river-borne silt deposited in the delta. The upper and central portions of the delta are almost entirely under cultivation, principally for rice. The southern portion of the ecoregion transitions into the Burmese Coast mangroves and is made up of fanlike marshes with oxbow lakes, islands, and meandering streams.\n\nBirds of the delta are both winter visitors and passage migrants including great cormorant (\"Phalacrocorax carbo\"), a wide variety of Anatidae, Eurasian coot (\"Fulica atra\"), about thirty species of migratory shorebirds, the whiskered tern (\"Chlidonias hybrida\"), the Caspian tern (\"Hydroprogne caspia\"), and the brown-headed gull (\"Larus brunnicephalus\"), which is very common. One of the most numerous wintering shorebird is the lesser sand plover (\"Charadrius mongolus\"), which occurs in flocks of many thousands along the outer coast of the delta. The wood sandpiper (\"Tringa glareola\") and red junglefowl (\"Gallus gallus\") are also abundant.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the spot-billed pelican (\"Pelecanus philippensis\") nested in huge numbers in south Myanmar. One colony on the Sittaung River plain to the east of the delta was described in November 1877 as covering and containing millions of birds. Immense colonies still bred in the area in 1910, but the birds had disappeared completely by 1939. Small numbers were regularly reported in the delta in the 1940s, but no breeding sites were located. , no pelicans have been recorded, and it may well be that the species is now extinct in Myanmar.\n\nSeveral species of large mammal occur in the delta, but their populations are small and scattered, with the possible exceptions of the Malayan sambar deer (\"Cervus unicolor equinus\"), Indian hog deer (\"C. porcinus\"), and wild boar (\"Sus scrofa\"), which have been reported from all Reserved Forests. Asian elephants (\"Elephas maximus\") were once widespread throughout the country with numbers as high as 10,000 animals, but in the numbers have dwindled, partly due to transferring the animals to logging camps. Other species reported to be present include the leopard, Bengal tiger, crab-eating macaque, wild dog, and otters (\"Panthera pardus, P. tigris, Cuon alpinus\", and \"Lutra\" species).\n\nThe saltwater crocodile (\"Crocodylus porosus\") can be found in the southern part of the delta. The species was formerly abundant in coastal regions, but population numbers have decreased because of a combination of commercial skin hunting, habitat loss, drowning in fishing nets and over-collection of living animals to supply crocodile farms.\n\nIt was at this river that a battle between a saltwater crocodile and a tiger was observed that ended with the reptile devouring the tiger.\n\nDespite recent declines in the sea turtle populations, five species are known to nest in Myanmar at well known island and mainland beaches known as turtle-banks. These are the olive ridley sea turtle (\"Lepidochelys olivacea\"), the loggerhead sea turtle (\"Caretta caretta\"), the green sea turtle (\"Chelonia mydas\"), the hawksbill sea turtle (\"Eretmochelys imbricata\"), and the leatherback sea turtle (\"Dermochelys coriacea\").\n\nThe Irrawaddy River has five major tributaries. As they flow through the northern tip of Myanmar – the Kachin State – they cut long north-south alluvial plains and relatively narrow upland valleys between the mountain ridges. The rivers joining the Irrawaddy are, from north to south:\n\n\nAs early as the sixth century, the Bamars were using the Irrawaddy to gain power in the region through trade and transport on the China – India route. By the twelfth century, a well-developed network of canals made for flourishing rice cultivation. Later, the river became a key economic tool of Imperial British interests, who set up trading ports along its shores.\n\nToday, the Irrawaddy is still the country's most important commercial waterway. Despite Mandalay's position as the chief rail and highway focus in northern Myanmar, a considerable amount of passenger and goods traffic moves by river. As the Irrawaddy Delta is one of the world's major rice-growing areas, one of the most important goods transported is rice. Teak logs – Myanmar is one of the world's top exporters – are floated down the river as large rafts. Before it is transported, teak has to be seasoned, because otherwise it won't float. This happens by girdling, a practice where a deep circular cut through bark and sap is made into the heartwood. Other major goods that are transported from the nation's heartlands to Yangon for export are other foodstuffs, petroleum, cotton, and local commodities.\n\nCommercial transportation on the Irrawaddy is maintained for about : from Hinthada to Bhamo () throughout the year, but from Bhamo to Myitkyina (200 km) for only seven months. More than of navigable waterways exist in the Irrawaddy delta, and there is a system of connecting canals. The Sittang is usable by smaller boats, but the Salween River, because of its rapids, is navigable for less than from the sea. Small steamers and country boats also serve the coasts of the Rakhine State and Tanintharyi Region. On the Chindwin River, transportation is carried on by steam or diesel vessels throughout the year up to Homalin—about 640 km from its confluence with the Irrawaddy. Seasonal navigation is carried on into Tamanthi, which is by river above Homalin.\n\nThe Chindwin valley has no railroad and relies heavily on river transport. Chauk, downstream from the confluence in the oil-field district, is a petroleum port. It is linked to Yangon by road and rail. Hinthada, near the apex of the delta, is the rail junction for lines leading to Kyangin and Bassein (Pathein). A ferry operates between Hinthada on the west bank and the railway station at Tharrawaw on the east bank.\n\nMyanmar's military junta signed an agreement with China Power Investment Corporation in May 2007 for the construction of seven hydroelectric dams along the Irrawaddy, Mali, and N'Mai River in Kachin State. The total planned output of all seven plants will be 15,160 MWs of electricity, making it the largest hydropower project in Myanmar, surpassing the 7100 MW Tasang Dam in Shan State.\nThe following data is available for the dam locations:\n\nThe power generated by the dams will be transmitted to other countries in the South-East Asian region, with most going to China. Other countries targeted for power export are Thailand, India and Bangladesh.\n\nThe largest of the seven, the Myitsone Dam, is located at the confluence of the Mali and N'Mai Rivers at the creation of the Irrawaddy. Although the China Power Investment Corporation is project manager of the Confluence Region Hydropower Projects. ParConfluence Region Hydropower Projects, several companies have been or are currently involved in the preparation, construction and financing of the 3,600 MW Myitsone Dam. Asia World Company has a key position, amidst Burmese Suntac Technologies and state-run Myanmar Electrical Power Enterprise, a state-owned utility enterprise responsible for power generation, transmission and distribution\n\nChinese involvement comes from China Power Investment Corporation, China Southern Power Grid, Yunnan Machinery Equipment Import & Export Company Changjiang Institute of Surveying, Planning, Design and Research.\n\nAt least one Japanese company is involved, Kansai Electric Power Company.\n\nDue to its location and size, construction of the Myitsone Dam has raised significant ecological and sociological concerns. According to the Irrawaddy Myitsone Dam Multipurpose Water Utilizing Project study, the maximum water level of the reservoir will be 290 metres. This makes for a flood zone of 766 km, compromising 47 villages.\n\nOther consequences of the inundation include loss of farmland, loss of spawning habitat as fish can not swim upstream anymore. The Kachin Development Networking Group, a network of civil society groups and development organisations in Kachin State warn this will lead to a loss of income for fishermen. They report locals are also worried about the flooding of cultural sites in the flood zone. As with other large dam projects, the Myitsone Dam construction will alter the hydrological characteristics of the river, e.g. preventing sediment from enriching riverbanks downstream, where it usually enriches the riverside food-producing plains. This can affect fertility as far downstream as the Irrawaddy Delta, the major rice-producing area of Myanmar.\n\nEcological concerns focus on the inundation of an area that is the border of the Indo-Burma and South Central China biodiversity hotspots. The Mali and N'mai River confluence region falls within the Mizoram-Manipur-Kachin rainforests, added to the WWF list of outstanding examples of biodiverse regions.\n\nThe location of the Myitsone Dam, located less than 100 km from a fault line where the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates meet, raised concerns about its earthquake resistance. Earthquakes in the region, such as the 5.3 magnitude earthquake that struck near the Myanmar-China border on 20 August 2008, prompted Naw Lar, the coordinator of the KDNG dam research project, to ask the junta to reconsider its dam projects.\n\nThe river flows through or past the following cities:\n\n\nUntil the construction of the Ava (Innwa) Bridge, a 16 span rail and road cantilever bridge built by the British colonial government in 1934, the only way across the Irrawaddy was by ferry. The bridge was destroyed by the retreating British Army during World War II and was rebuilt in 1954 after Burmese independence and was the only bridge to span the Irrawaddy until recent times when a spate of bridge construction has been carried out by the government.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2173526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173526", "title": "Shona people", "text": "Shona people\n\nThe Shona people () are an ethnic group native to Southern Africa, primarily Zimbabwe (where they form the vast majority). They have five major clans, and are adjacent to other groups with similar cultures and languages.\n\nThe Shona people are divided into tribes in eastern and northern Zimbabwe. Their estimated population is 10.7 million:\n\nOther members or close relatives:\n\nWhen the term \"Shona\" was created during the early-19th-century Mfecane (possibly by the Ndebele king Mzilikazi), it was used as a pejorative for non-Nguni people; there was no awareness of a common identity by the tribes and peoples which make up the present-day Shona. The Shona people of the Zimbabwe highlands, however, retained a vivid memory of the ancient kingdom often identified with the Kingdom of Mutapa. The terms \"Karanga\", \"Kalanga\" and \"Kalaka\", now the names of discrete groups, seem to have been used for all Shona before the Mfecane. \"Ethnologue\" notes that the language of the Bakalanga is mutually intelligible with the main dialects of Karanga and other Bantu languages in central and eastern Africa, but counts them separately. The Kalanga and Karanga are believed to be one clan who built the Mapungubwe, Great Zimbabwe and Khami, and were assimilated by the Zezuru. Although many Karanga and Kalanga words are interchangeable, Kalanga is different from Zezuru.\n\nDialect groups have many similarities. Although \"standard\" Shona is spoken throughout Zimbabwe, the dialects help identify a speaker's town (or village) and ethnic group. Each Shona dialect is specific to a certain ethnic group.\n\nIn 1931, during his attempt to reconcile the dialects into a single standard Shona language, Clement Doke identified five groups and subdivisions:\n\nDialects developed during the dispersion of tribes across Zimbabwe over a long period, and the influx of immigrants into the country from bordering countries has contributed to the variety.\n\nDuring the 11th century, the Kalanga people formed kingdoms on the Zimbabwe plateau. Construction began on Great Zimbabwe, capital of the kingdom of Zimbabwe. The Torwa dynasty ruled the kingdom of Butua, and the kingdom of Mutapa preceded the Rozvi Empire (which lasted into the 19th century).\n\nBrother succeeded brother in the dynasties, leading to civil wars which were exploited by the Portuguese during the 16th century. The kings ruled a number of chiefs, sub-chiefs and headmen.\n\nThe kingdoms were replaced by new groups who moved onto the plateau. The Ndebele destroyed the Rozvi Empire during the 1830s; the Portuguese slowly eroded the kingdom of Mutapa, which extended to the Mozambique coast after it provided valued exports (particularly gold) for Swahili, Arab and East Asian traders. The British destroyed traditional power in 1890 and colonized the plateau of Rhodesia in 1890, and the Portuguese colonial government in Mozambique fought the remnants of the kingdom of Mutapa until 1902.\n\nThe Shona have traditionally practiced subsistence agriculture. They grew sorghum (largely replaced by maize), beans (since the middle of the first millennium AD), African groundnuts, and (beginning in the 16th century) pumpkins. Sorghum and maize are used to prepare the main dish, a thickened porridge called \"sadza\", and the traditional beer known as \"hwahwa\". The Shona also keep cattle and goats, since livestock are an important food reserve during droughts. Precolonial Shona states derived substantial revenue from the export of mining products, particularly gold and copper.\n\nTraditional Shona housing, known as \"musha\", are round huts arranged around a cleared yard (\"ruvanze\"). Each hut has a specific function, such as a kitchen or a lounging space.\n\nThe Shona are known for their stone sculptures, which were discovered during the 1940s. Shona sculpture developed during the eleventh century and peaked in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries before beginning a slow decline until their mid-20th-century rediscovery. Although most of the sculptures are sedimentary-stone (such as soapstone) birds or humans, some are made with harder stone such as serpentinite and the rarer verdite. During the 1950s, Zimbabwean artists began carving stone sculptures for sale to European art lovers. The sculptures quickly became popular, and were bought and exhibited by art museums worldwide. Many of the sculptures depict the transformation of spirits into animals (or vice versa), and some are abstract. Many Zimbabwean artists carve wood and stone for sale to tourists, and traditional pottery also exists.\n\nTraditional textile production was high-quality, but expensive; the Shona preferred wearing skins or imported fabrics.\n\nShona traditional music, like other African traditional music, has constant melodies and variable rhythms. Its most important instruments are ngoma drums and the mbira. The drums vary in size and shape, depending on the type of music they are accompanying. The way in which they are played depends on the size of a drum and the type of music. Although large drums are typically played with sticks and smaller drums with an open palm, the small drum used for the \"amabhiza\" dance is played with a hand and a stick; the stick rubs, or scratches, the drum to produce a screeching sound.\n\nThe mbira has become a national instrument of sorts in Zimbabwe. It has a number of variants, including the nhare, mbira dzavadzimu, the Mbira Nyunga Nyunga, njari mbira and matepe. The mbira is played at religious and secular gatherings, and the different mbiras have different purposes. The 22–24-key mbira dzavadzimu is used to summon spirits, and the 15-key Mbira Nyunga Nyunga is taught from primary school to university. Shona music also uses percussion instruments such as the marimba (similar to a xylophone), hosho (shakers), leg rattles, wooden clappers (makwa) and the chikorodzi, a notched stick played with another stick.\n\nAlthough sixty to eighty percent of the Shona people are Christians, traditional beliefs remain. According to Shona tradition, the afterlife is not another world (like the Christian heaven and hell) but another form of existence in this world. The Shona attitude towards dead ancestors is very similar to their attitude towards living parents and grandparents. The Bira ceremony, which often lasts all night, summons ancestral spirits for guidance and help.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, totems (\"mutupo\") have been used by the Shona people since their culture developed. Totems identify clans, and up to 25 totems have been identified. Similar totems exist among the South African Tswana, Zulu, Northern Ndebele and Herero. The totem system is problematic for orphans (especially abandoned babies), who may not have a totem.\n\n\n"}

When the young Don arrived in London as a six-year-old, he had a broad Glaswegian accent.\n\nDon was educated at the Henry Thornton Grammar School in Clapham. His first job was with the Jack Hylton Entertainment Organisation and he also worked on various local newspapers in London before becoming a junior reporter for the Sunday Citizen. A keen sportsman in his younger days, he was London table tennis champion for two years and also enjoyed boxing, cycling, running and water polo.\n\nDon first broadcast to the nation in 1955 at the age of sixteen as co-host of \"The Younger Generation\" on the BBC Light Programme having answered an ad in the Radio Times. He contributed to the network for several years before being called up for national service. On his return in 1962, he married his longtime sweetheart Yvonne, whom he had known for eight years.\n\nIn 1966 he signed up with the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS), where his encyclopaedic knowledge of sport kept him in demand as a broadcast anchor and commentator for international boxing and football matches. It also took him across the globe including to Aden (now Yemen) in 1966/67, to Cologne in Germany (1968–69 and again for part of '72) and then to Gibraltar for three years.\n\nIn 1972, Don was assigned as a BFBS reporter for the Munich Olympics, where he secured a worldwide scoop – an exclusive interview with the swimmer Mark Spitz, who'd won an – unprecedented at the time – seven gold medals at the Games.\n\nDon was also press officer and matchday announcer for Fulham F.C. in the mid-1970s when George Best and Bobby Moore were in the team.\n\nDon returned to the BBC in 1974, joining the Light Programme's successor Radio 2 as a continuity announcer and newsreader, his first BBC staff job. He soon became a regular cover presenter, hosting such iconic shows as Two-Way Family Favourites, Friday Night is Music Night, Saturday Night with the BBC Radio Orchestra, \"Night Ride\", \"Band Parade\", \"Music Through Midnight\" and \"Sport on 2\", and was also a regular cover presenter, stepping into the shoes of Terry Wogan, Jimmy Young, Ed Stewart, David Hamilton, Charlie Chester and late John Dunn.\n\nDon joined Radio Medway in 1979 and was with the station when it relaunched as BBC Radio Kent in July 1983.\n\nIn October 1984, he was part of the launch team for Kent's very first commercial radio station, Invicta Sound (now Heart, Kent), where he hosted a mid morning music and chat programme. Invicta Sound's 'debate and discussion' launch format was famously unsuccessful and most of the early presenters found themselves out of work when the schedule was revamped less than a year later.\n\nDon returned to BBC Radio Kent for the rest of the '80s and early '90s as presenter of the popular nostalgia music show, Remember When, and also hosted the Sunday morning breakfast shows which included his popular topical chats with Canon Clifford Pollard (deceased), who was Director of Education for the Diocese of Canterbury at the time. Always a crowd puller, Don hosted a series of stage shows for the BBC at the Kent County Show and was one of the main anchors of BBC Radio Kent's marathon six-hour live fund-raising Children in Need broadcasts, as well as being match day announcer at Gillingham F.C. for most of the '80s.\n\nDon pursued his broadcasting career in Malta in the early '90s where he also married his second wife Cheryl, returning to Britain, to the beautiful county of Kent, as he referred to his adopted home, in 1997. It was from there that he relaunched his UK broadcasting career, tossing out the gramophone decks and needles to embrace the digital broadcasting age, and was soon back behind the microphone at Channel Travel Radio in Folkestone giving out cross channel information to motorists on the M20.\n\nA stint as weekend newsreader for London talk station LBC followed, before he joined the new over fifties digital service PrimeTime Radio where he presented the late night slot, \"In Mellow Mood\". He also presented shows for Primetime's digital sister station, Saga DAB radio and for Saga 106.6 FM in the East Midlands and Saga 105.7 FM in the West Midlands, all of which were recorded in Saga Digital's west London studios.\n\nWhen Primetime and Saga ceased broadcasting in 2006, Don emigrated to Estepona on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain. His final radio stop was with REM FM (now Talk Radio Europe),where, from May 2007, he presented weekend shows with a mix of music, chat and celebrity guests as diverse as the entertainer Max Bygraves and the jazz loving politician Ken Clarke.\n\nDurbridge died in Spain on 9 June 2012. He is survived by his first wife, Yvonne, and also leaves a daughter, Moira, and a grandson, Teddy.\n\n"}

Brown (born August 1937) is a young Earth creationist, who is the director of his own ministry called the Center for Scientific Creation. \"The Skeptic's Dictionary\" considers him to be one of the leaders of the creation science movement. He proposes a specific version of flood geology called the Hydroplate Theory. He is a retired army officer with a degree in mechanical engineering. \n\nBrown has a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a B.S. from West Point and he served as an officer in the United States military until he retired in 1980.\n\nSince retiring from the military in 1980, Brown has been the director of his \"Center for Scientific Creation\" and has done his own research, writing, and speaking on origins theory. In 1998, Brown was appointed to a committee reviewing Arizona's state science standards. Evolution was retained in the Arizona state science standards after a final decision in August 1998.\n\nIn Brown's \"In the Beginning: Compelling Evidence for Creation and the Flood\" he suggests evidence against evolution and for creation science and flood geology (including hydroplates). It is divided into three sections, the first of which explores discoveries made by scientists that do not fit the theory of evolution. The second section outlines various alternate explanations to geological and astronomical subjects such as the mid-oceanic ridge and comets, which Brown states evolutionary science cannot explain. The final section presents a variety of other questions encountered in the creation-evolution controversy.\n\nIn 1989, the Creation/Evolution journal of the National Center for Science Education published a critique of Brown's theory. Jim Lippard, graduate student of philosophy begins with a criticism focusing primarily on fossil evidence of human evolution. Brown addressed several of Lippard's points in his response, and three further articles were printed: Lippard, Brown, and ending with Lippard, where he asserts that Brown made serious errors, including using \"mistaken claims about what others have written.\" The series of articles does not discuss Brown's hydroplates, apart from Brown's claim that Lippard \"dismisses or ignores the bulk of the book and specifically addresses only a very small fraction of its substance.\"\n\nRobert T. Pennock has described Brown's position as being typical, other than the unique feature of his hydroplates hypothesis, of young-earth creationist's explaining all major terrestrial features in terms of a catastrophic Biblical flood.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of Brown's theories, compared to other creationist theories, are the hydroplates. He claims that, prior to the Flood of Noah, there was an enormous amount of water underneath the crust of the Earth, and that this water pressurizing, shattering the crust, and breaking it into plates was both part of the Flood and created the continental plates that mainstream geology associates with plate tectonics. Because the plates are, in this theory, formed by the action of water, he calls them \"hydroplates\" and gives their name to the theory. \n\nWalt Brown has had contentious relations with other creationist organizations. Answers in Genesis has a standing offer to Brown to publish some of his material in their journals but Brown has declined. The old earth creationist organization Answers in Creation has published material rebutting Brown's hydroplate theory. The Christian American Scientific Affiliation website features a video critical of Brown's video \"God's Power and Scriptures Authority\" by Steven H. Schimmrich of Kutztown University. \nBrown has stated that no \"evolutionist\" will publicly debate with him, but has been accused by opponents of complicating such debates. An abortive attempt at such a debate was held in 1989 and 1990 in the pages of Creation/Evolution, the National Center for Science Education journal, before Brown refused to continue. Joe Meert of \"Gondwana Research\", a journal promoting research related to the origin and evolution of continents, alleges he \"signed a contract\" for such a debate with Brown in 2000. He claims Brown disputed the terms of the contract and it did not take place. Brown stated on his website that the actual reason for the debate not taking place was that the Meert wanted to add religion and since Dr. Brown is not a theologian, he wanted the debate to be strictly science. According to Georgia State University biology professor Fred K. Parrish, who afterwards claimed he was \"tricked\" into an April 1985 public debate with Brown, claims Brown has a set of preconditions (such as Brown speaks first, the debate moderator sits on his side, and all debate material would be scientific, not religious in nature).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2173558", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173558", "title": "Katherine Philips", "text": "Katherine Philips\n\nKatherine or Catherine Philips (1 January 1631/2 – 22 June 1664), also known as \"The Matchless Orinda\", was an Anglo-Welsh royalist poet, translator, and woman of letters. She achieved renown as a translator of Pierre Corneille's \"Pompée\" and \"Horace\", and for her editions of poetry after her death. She was highly regarded by many writers of 17th century literature, including John Dryden and John Keats, as being influential.\n\nBorn in London, Katherine Philips was daughter of John Fowler, a Presbyterian cloth merchant of Bucklersbury, near the river in the City of London, and of Katherine Oxenbridge, whose father worked in the medical profession. Philips, it seems, had a strong memory and was intellectually advanced, and was, according to a cousin of hers, able to read the Bible before the age of four. Additionally, she acquired remarkable fluency in several languages. After her father's death, she moved to Wales with her newly married mother.  She attended boarding school from 1640 to 1645 where she began to write verse within a circle of friends and to appreciate French romances and Cavalier plays from which she would later choose many of the pet names she gave to members of her Society of Friendship. This school, run by a Mrs Salmon, was in Hackney, a hotbed of female education at the time.\n\nPhilips also broke with Presbyterian traditions, in both religion and politics, by becoming a member of the Church of England, as well as an ardent admirer of the king and his policy.\n\nIn 1647, when she was sixteen, Katherine Fowler married Welsh Parliamentarian James Philipps. James Philips' age has been the subject of some dispute, as he was long thought to be 54 years old on their wedding day, thus making him 38 years Katherine's senior. However, it seems their recovered marriage certificate has since shown that James Philips was actually only 24 years old at the time of their union. The couple had two children, including a son named Hector who did not live past infancy. He was buried in London in 1655. Hector's death was the subject of some of Philips' later poems, such as \"Epitaph on Hector Philips\" and \"On the Death of my First and Dearest Childe.\"\n\nThe Society of Friendship had its origins in the cult of Neoplatonic love imported from the continent in the 1630s by Charles I's French wife, Henrietta Maria. Members adopted pseudonyms drawn from French pastoral romances of Cavalier dramas. Philips dramatised in her Society of Friendship the ideals, as well as the realities and tribulations, of Platonic love. Thus the Society helped establish a literary standard for her generation and Orinda herself as a model for the female writers who followed her. Her home at the Priory, Cardigan, Wales became the centre of the Society of Friendship, the members of which were known to one another by pastoral names: Philips was \"Orinda\", her husband \"Antenor\", and Sir Charles Cotterel \"Poliarchus\". \"The Matchless Orinda\", as her admirers called her, was regarded as the apostle of female friendship, and inspired great respect. She was widely considered an exemplar of the ideal woman writer: virtuous, proper, and chaste. She was frequently contrasted to the more daring Aphra Behn, to the latter's detriment. Her poems, frequently occasional, typically celebrate the refined pleasures of platonic love. Jeremy Taylor in 1659 dedicated to her his \"Discourse on the Nature, Offices and Measures of Friendship\", and Cowley, Henry Vaughan the Silurist, the Earl of Roscommon and the Earl of Cork and Orrery all celebrated her talent.\n\nIn 1662 she went to Dublin to pursue her husband's claim to certain Irish estates, which, due to her late father's past monetary investments in the British military, they were in danger of losing. There she completed a translation of Pierre Corneille's \"Pompée\", produced with great success in 1663 in the Smock Alley Theatre, and printed in the same year both in Dublin and London, under the title \"Pompey\". Although other women had translated or written dramas, her translation of \"Pompée\" broke new ground as the first rhymed version of a French tragedy in English and the first English play written by a woman to be performed on the professional stage. In 1664, an edition of her poetry entitled \"Poems by the Incomparable Mrs. K.P.\" was published; this was an unauthorised edition that made several grievous errors. In March 1664, Philips travelled to London with a nearly completed translation of Corneille's \"Horace\", but died of smallpox. She was buried in the church of St Benet Sherehog, later destroyed in the Great Fire of London. \n\nAfter her death, in 1667 an authorised edition of her poetry was printed entitled \"Poems by the Most Deservedly Admired Mrs. Katherine Philips, the Matchless Orinda\". The edition included her translations of \"Pompée\" and \"Horace\".\n\nEdward Phillips, nephew of John Milton, placed Katherine Philips high above Aphra Behn, writing in \"Theatrum poetarum\" (1675), a list of the chief poets of all ages and countries, that she was \"the most applauded...Poetess of our Nation\".\n\nThe literary atmosphere of her circle is preserved in the excellent \"Letters of Orinda to Poliarchus\", published by Bernard Lintot in 1705 and 1709. Poliarchus (Sir Charles Cotterell) was master of the ceremonies at the court of the Restoration, and afterwards translated the romances of La Calprenède. Philips had two children, one of whom, Katharine, became the wife of a \"Lewis Wogan\" of Boulston, Pembrokeshire. According to Gosse, Philips may have been the author of a volume of \"Female Poems ... written by Ephelia\", which are in the style of Orinda, though other scholars have not embraced this attribution.\n\nPhilips's translations and poems consider questions of political authority and express her royalist beliefs. Her work also considers the nature and value of friendship between women. There has been speculation over whether her work could be described as lesbian. Certainly her representations of female friendship are intense, even passionate. She herself always insisted on their platonic nature and characterises her relationships as the \"meeting of souls,\" as in these lines from \"To my Excellent Lucasia, on our Friendship\":\n\n<poem>\nFor as a watch by art is wound\nTo motion, such was mine;\nBut never had Orinda found\nA soul till she found thine;\n\nWhich now inspires, cures, and supplies,\nAnd guides my darkened breast;\nFor thou art all that I can prize,\nMy joy, my life, my rest. (9–16)\n</poem>\n\nHarriette Andreadis has argued that 'her manipulations of the conventions of male poetic discourse constitute a form of lesbian writing.' However, there are many critics who do not believe Philips's poetry is indicative of her sexuality. For example, in discussing \"To the Excellent Lucasia\" Mark Llewellyn argues that the image portrayed by the speaker is \"stripped of all sensual appetite, could become the pathway to apprehension of, and eventually mystic union with, divine love and beauty\" (447). Andreadis says, \"friendship here is no less than the mingling of souls, the intimacy of hearts joined in secret and holding each other's secrets, sublimely elevating the friends to such ecstasies that they pity the mundane pleasures and powers of worldly rulers\" (529). \n\n\"Upon the Double Murder of King Charles\" is a more politically minded piece than many of her others from this time period, although she is often associated with a class of poets termed Royalist or Cavalier poets, noting their political sympathy to the Royalist cause, those who supported the monarchy of King Charles I of England during the English Civil War and the following English Interregnum.\n\nShe inspired the figure of \"Orinda\", elderly widow, hypersensitive to matters of love, and she herself a victim of love (albeit platonic) for a woman, in the Italian tragedy of 1671 \"Il Cromuele\" (Cromwell) written by Girolamo Graziani, set in England during the Civil War.\n\nOn 10 February 1663 Philips premiered her adaptation of the French verse tragedy, Pierre Corneille's, \"Pompée\" at Smock Alley. The opening night was notable for its political undertones, as well as having the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the audience. It also had theatre goers of all classes in attendance. Some Catholic, loyal to the monarchy after the war and desiring to acquire their lands back for their families. Others in the audience were Protestant and felt entitled to these same lands based on the promises made to them. Due to Ireland's tense political climate, the theatre was a welcomed escape from these politically complicated Catholic/Protestant relations, following the English Civil War and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. The play opened with a direct heroic couplet suggesting the idea of two rivals finding a successful compromise:\"The \"mighty Rivals, whose destructive Rage\"\n\n\"Did the whole World in Civil Arms engage,\"\n\n\"Are now agreed, and make it both their Choice,\"\n\n\"To have their Fates determin'd by your Voice.\"\" \nThe original speaker on opening night failed to mention specific details to the play which are in the script in this opening, allowing the audience to assume the text could be directed at the current political affairs. There are rumours that Phillips was either in the audience, or could have even been an actress in the play herself.\n\nThere has been speculation among critics over Katherine Philips' sexuality, specifically in regards to the relationships she shared with some of her female friends. Literary critics have often highlighted suggestions of female intimacy and eroticism within Philips' work. In fact, many of her poems were written for or about fellow Society of Friendship members Anne Owen and Mary Aubrey, who went by the names of Lucasia and Rosania, respectively. A series of letters exchanged by Philips and her friend Sir Charles Cotterell between 6 December 1661 and 17 May 1664 were recovered and published in 1705,  under the title \"Letters from Orinda to Poliarchus.\"  Hints of Philips' affection for Owen can be found throughout this correspondence, notably within an exchange referring to Philips' attempt to convince Owen to marry Sir Charles in order to keep her nearby, as Owen was engaged at the time and planned to move to Dublin with one Marcus Trevor. This attempt would ultimately prove unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the son of Ali Muddat ibn al-Husayn.\n\nHe was born in the Dar al-Taj Palace at La Marsa. On 14 January 1928 he became the Bey al-Mahalla (crown prince) of Tunis, and thus the lieutenant-general of the Beylical Army, and became bey upon the death of his cousin Muhammad VI al-Habib.\n\nA year after his accession, in May 1930, an International Eucharistic Congress was convened in Carthage to celebrate the centenary of the French conquest of Algeria. It was the first such congress held in Africa, and the first in a Muslim-majority country. Ahmed Bey reluctantly agreed to serve as Honorary President of the Congress, which was partly paid for with 2 million francs worth of funds from the Tunisian government, raised in taxes on Tunisia's Muslim population. The event, with some participants dressed as Crusaders and others using it as a platform for speeches hostile to Islam, caused a furore in the Tunisian national movement. The nationalist newspaper \"La Voix du Tunisien\" ('The Tunisian Voice') called on the Bey to resign his Honorary Presidency and for other officials to dissociate themselves from the event and members of the Destour Party claimed that the Bey's involvement demonstrated his subservience to the French and abandonment of the defence of his people's interests.\n\nIn 1940 the new Vichy regime in France led to the appointment of a new Resident General, Admiral Jean-Pierre Esteva who began pressing Ahmed Bey to implement Vichy anti-Jewish legislation. Article 9 of the French law of 3 October 1940 decreed that the anti-Jewish laws were applicable in the protectorate territories of the French Republic, including Tunisia.\n\nThe Bey made very limited efforts to resist these demands, but eventually signed a decree on 3 October 1940, which excluded Jews from the civil service and from professional roles connected to press, radio, theatre and cinema, while also allowing the publication of a 'Journal israélite de Tunisie' (Jewish Newspaper of Tunisia').\n\nHe also imposed a \"numerus clausus\" on the liberal professions, although it was never put into effect in some fields, including medicine, where instead Jews were forbidden from treating anyone other than other Jews.\n\nAhmed Bey signed another decree on 5 June 1941 dissolving Jewish youth groups, and a further one on 29 September 1941 dissolving the Jewish Community Council in Tunis and replacing it with an appointed body. His decree of 26 June 1941 ordered a census of the Jews.\n\nIn the period of Ahmad's reign, the nationalist movement grew in political importance. The burials issue was particularly contentious, and the Neo Destour party was formed after the Ksar Hellal Congress in 1934.\n\nAhmad died at La Marsa and was buried at the Tourbet el Bey. He was succeeded by his cousin Muhammad VII al-Munsif.\n\nAhmad II had ten sons and eight daughters, including Prince Muhammad al-Taib Bey (1902–1989) who was the head of the Husainid Dynasty from 1974 until 1989.\n\n"}

As a result of the floods, the Braakman was created or enlarged. In this new area, new parishes and villages started to appear.

The storm tide responsible became known as the First Saint Elizabeth's flood. The damage was catastrophic. The area of Zeeland-Flanders had already been flooded 20 years earlier, in 1375. Through this, the Zuiderzee was created. Around the Zuiderzee, polders were diked, and within these polders, new parishes arose. Unfortunately, in 1404, everything was destroyed again. This time, a complete spit that was home to a number of small towns such as Ijzendijke and Hugevliet, which were spared in 1375, was engulfed during the flood. In the county of Flanders all the coast islands in the mouth of the Westerschelde were washed away. After this calamity John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy (\"Jan zonder Vrees\") gave the command to link all the dikes already existing into one large dike which ran from the north from the county to the south. This explains why the Belgian coast line is so straight. Since Jan zonder Vrees was also count of Flanders, this dike is still named .\n\n"}

Her most successful US hit single, \"Trouble-Maker\", spent two weeks at No. 1.\n\nFrom 1975 until 1983, she also performed as a backing vocalist with Thelma Houston and on a number of Donna Summer albums.\n\nPrior to releases in the US through composer Giorgio Moroder's Oasis record label during the 1970s, Kelly recorded a single in Germany entitled \"Kung Fu Is Back Again\" (1974), released on Atlantic and produced by the songwriter-producer Pete Bellotte alongside Moroder.\n\nIn 1975 she released the single \"Love Power\" a cover version of a 1967 hit by The Sandpebbles, written by Teddy Vann, and later made famous as part of the repertoire of Luther Vandross. The single was backed with \"Drifter\", never included in any album and an example of the pre-disco Moroder-Bellotte production, similar to Donna Summer's \"Lady of the night\" material. In April 1976, Kelly turned to disco with the single \"Trouble-Maker\" and released an album by the same name. The album contained five tracks, including an extended version of \"Love Power\". \n\nIn 1977, she released \"Zodiac Lady,\" a controversial album that Casablanca Records, during the disco heyday, refused at first to release. Imports from Italy swamped the international dance floors, creating a hit for the title track and songs such as \"Love Sign\". This album spawned a twelve-inch single, \"Zodiacs,\" which had major club and radio play. \"Funky Stardust\", \"Love Sign\" and \"I’m Sagittarius\" were released from that album, in addition to \"Zodiacs\" itself in different countries. \"Zodiacs\" peaked at No. 24 in the US Hot Dance/Club Play chart in 1977, and at No. 44 in the UK Singles Chart in 1978. \"Love Sign\" was released as a single in Italy only. Both \"Trouble-Maker\" and \"Zodiac Lady\" were produced by Moroder and Bellotte.\n\n\"Gettin' The Spirit\", followed in March 1978. Produced by Giorgio Moroder and Bob Esty, it was an album consisting of gospel songs, performed in the disco style. The album featured dance versions of the Edwin Hawkins penned, \"Oh Happy Day\" and \"To My Father's House,\" with both songs released on one single. \"Gettin' The Spirit\" was also released with a disco version of \"My Sweet Lord\". It peaked at No. 9 on the US Hot Dance/Club Play chart in 1978.\n\nWhen Pope John Paul II succeeded John Paul I in 1978, Kelly released the single \"John Paul II\", The single never made it onto an album, but the B-side \"Tribute to Love\" did in the late 1980 release, \"Roots Can Be Anywhere.\" By this time, Kelly was no longer with Casablanca Records. Two singles were released: \"Kabacka Shaka\" and \"Roots Can Be Anywhere\", but the album had limited success also due to poor distribution. It was also released as “This is Roberta Kelly” with a longer version of Kabacka Shaka” and without “Coconut Rock”. It was produced by Michael Holm.\n\nIn 1981, Kelly released the album, \"Tell Me\", through Baby Records in Italy, featuring \"Patty Cake\", produced by Jürgen Koppers. It was a last attempt to revive disco. After that, Kelly's next release was not until 1995, when she issued \"The Sound of Color\" and \"Jubilee in Germany,\" celebrating the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II.\n\nDuring the summer of 2008, Kelly resurfaced with the single, \"America (The Sound of Colour Realized)\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2173596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173596", "title": "Ruthwell Cross", "text": "Ruthwell Cross\n\nThe Ruthwell Cross is a stone Anglo-Saxon cross probably dating from the 8th century, when the village of Ruthwell, now in Scotland, was part of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria.\n\nIt is the most famous and elaborate Anglo-Saxon monumental sculpture, and possibly contains the oldest surviving text, predating any manuscripts containing Old English poetry. It has been described by Nikolaus Pevsner thus; \"The crosses of Bewcastle and Ruthwell ... are the greatest achievement of their date in the whole of Europe.\"\n\nThe cross was smashed by Presbyterian iconoclasts in 1642, and the pieces left in the churchyard until they were restored and re-erected in the manse garden in 1823 by Henry Duncan. In 1887 it was moved into its current location inside Ruthwell church, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, when the apse which holds it was specially built. It was designated a scheduled monument in 1921, but had this removed in 2018.\n\nAnglo-Saxon crosses are closely related to the contemporary Irish high crosses, and both are part of the Insular art tradition. The Ruthwell cross features the largest figurative reliefs found on any surviving Anglo-Saxon cross—which are virtually the largest surviving Anglo-Saxon reliefs of any sort—and has inscriptions in both Latin and, unusually for a Christian monument, the runic alphabet, the latter containing lines similar to lines 39–64 of \"Dream of the Rood\", an Old English poem, which were possibly added at a later date. It is high.\n\nThe two main sides of the cross (north and south) feature figurative relief carvings, now considerably worn, that depict Christ and several other figures; their subjects and interpretation have been much discussed by art historians, and the cross continues to be \"one of the most extensive and most studied of all surviving visual programs of the early Middle Ages.\" It is clear to most scholars that the images and texts each form part of a sophisticated and unified programme, \"almost an academician's monument,\" though a number of different schemes have been proposed, and some suggest the runic inscription may have been added later.\n\nThe largest panel on the cross (north side) shows either Christ treading on the beasts, a subject especially popular with the Anglo-Saxons, or its rare pacific variant \"Christ as Judge recognised by the beasts in the desert\", as suggested by the unique Latin inscription surrounding the panel: \"IHS XPS iudex aequitatis; bestiae et dracones cognoverunt in deserto salvatorem mundi\" – \"Jesus Christ: the judge of righteousness: the beasts and dragons recognised in the desert the saviour of the world.\" Whatever the subject, it is clearly the same as the very similar relief that is the largest panel on the nearby Bewcastle Cross which, subject to dating, was probably created by the same artists. Below this is \"Saints Paul and Antony breaking bread in the desert\", another rare scene identified by an inscription (\"Sanctus Paulus et Antonius duo eremitae fregerunt panem in deserto\"), then either a \"Flight into Egypt\" or perhaps a \"Return from Egypt\", and at the bottom a scene too worn to decipher, which may have been a \"Nativity of Christ\".\n\nOn the south side is \"Mary Magdalene drying the feet of Christ\", which is bordered by the longest Latin inscription on the cross: \"Attulit alabastrum unguenti et stans retro secus pedes eius lacrimis coepit rigare pedes eius et capillis capitas sui tergebat\" – see Luke 7:37–38 and John 12:3. Below this is the \"Healing of the man born blind\" from John 9:1, inscribed: \"Et praeteriens vidit hominem caecum a natibitate et sanavit eum ab infirmitate,\" the \"Annunciation\" (\"Et ingressus angelus ad eam dixit ave gratia plena dominus tecum benedicta tu in mulieribus\" – “And an angel came to her saying, “Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you amongst women.””-- Luke 1:28) and the \"Crucifixion\", which on stylistic grounds is considered to have been added at a considerably later period.\n\nThese scenes are on the main, lower, section of the shaft, which was broken above the largest scenes, and possibly the two sections were not restored the right way round. Above the large scene on the north side is either John the Baptist holding a lamb, or possibly God the Father holding the Lamb of God, who opens a book as in Apocalypse 5:1–10. Above this (and another break) are two remaining figures of the Four Evangelists with their symbols that originally were on the four arms of the cross-head: St. Matthew on the lowest arm, and St. John the Evangelist on the top arm. The side arms and centre roundel of the cross are replacements, of purely speculative (and most improbable) design.\n\nOn the south side, \"Martha and Mary\" (with inscription) are followed by an archer, the subject of almost as much debate as the judging Christ, on the lowest arm of the Cross, and an eagle on the top arm.\n\nIt escaped injury at the time of general destruction during the Reformation in the sixteenth century, but in 1640 the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland ordered the \"\"many idolatrous monuments erected and made for religious worship\"\" to be \"\"taken down, demolished, and destroyed\".\" It was not until two years later, however, that the cross was taken down when an Act was passed \"\"anent the Idolatrous Monuments in Ruthwell\".\" The usual account is that the cross was taken down in the church or churchyard soon after the 1642 order and broken up. One piece, it appears, was used as a bench to sit upon. The pieces were later removed from the church and left out in the churchyard. By 1823, Henry Duncan had collected all the pieces he could find, and put them together, commissioning a new crossbeam (the original was lost), and having gaps filled in with small pieces of stone. He then erected it in the manse garden.\n\nDuncan's restoration is questionable. He was convinced that he was reconstructing a \"Popish\" (Roman Catholic) monument, and based his work on \"drawings of similar Popish relics.\" Duncan dismissed the rare early medieval motif of Paul and Anthony breaking bread in the desert as probably \"founded on some Popish tradition.\"\n\nIt has been suggested that the work was not in fact originally a cross. In a 2008 journal article, Patrick W. Conner wrote that he would not call the structure a cross: \"Fred Orton has argued persuasively that the lower stone on which the runic poem is found may, indeed, never have belonged to a standing cross, or if it did, that cannot be asserted with confidence now. For that reason, I shall refer throughout to the Ruthwell Monument in preference to the Ruthwell Cross.\"\nIn his 1998 essay, “Rethinking the Ruthwell Monument: Fragments and Critique; Tradition and History; Tongues and Sockets,” scholar Fred Orton discusses a note Reginald Bainbrigg wrote to William Camden in 1600 for possible publication in any new edition of his 1586 \"Britannia\": “Bainbrigg saw a ‘column’ which he referred to as a ‘cross,’” Orton said of the note. Orton is also convinced the piece is made of two different types of stone: “... it seems to make more sense to see the Ruthwell monument as originally a column ... amended with the addition of a Crucifixion scene, and then ... further amended with the addition of a cross made of a different kind of stone.\"\n\nAt each side of the vine-tracery runic inscriptions are carved. The runes were first described around 1600, and Reginald Bainbrigg of Appleby recorded the inscription for the \"Britannia\" of William Camden. Around 1832, the runes were recognized as different from the Scandinavian futhark (categorized as Anglo-Saxon runes) by Thorleif Repp, by reference to the Exeter Book. \nHis rendition referred to a place called the vale of Ashlafr, compensation for injury, a font and a monastery of Therfuse.\nJohn Mitchell Kemble in 1840 advanced a reading referring to Mary Magdalene. \n\nThe better known \"Dream of the Rood\" interpretation is due to a revised reading of Kemble's in an 1842 article. \nThe inscription along the top and left side is read as:\n\nKemble's revised reading is based on the poem of the Vercelli Book, to the extent that missing words in each are supplied from the other. Kemble himself notes how the inscription may be \"corrected\" with the help of the Vercelli Book.\nThe inscription on the left side is read:\nThe manuscript text reads:\n\nThe interpretation is disputed and may be a conjecture inserted by Kemble himself: O'Neill (2005) notes Kemble's \"almost pathological dislike of Scandinavian interference in what he sees as the English domain.\" \n\nMany believe that the runes, as opposed to the Latin inscriptions, were added later, possibly as late as the 10th century. Conner agrees with Paul Meyvaert's conclusion that the runic poem dates from after the period in which the monument was created. He says Meyvaert has “satisfactorily explained” that the layout of the runes suggest “that the stone was already standing when the decision to add the runic poem was made.” The runic inscription on the monument is not a “formulaic” memorial text of the kind usually carved in Old English on stone. Rather, Conner sees the content of the runic addition to the monument as related to prayers used in the adoration of the cross first composed in the tenth century. He therefore concludes that the poem was developed in the 10th century – well after the creation of the monument.\n\nThe \"Visionary Cross project\", led by Catherine Karkov, Daniel Paul O’Donnell, and Roberto Rosselli Del Turco, studies crosses such as the Ruthwell Cross, the Bewcastle Cross, and the Brussels Cross, and in 2012 performed 3D-scans at Ruthwell.\n\n\n\n\n"}

B. Martin, and commissioned on 19 November 1861, Acting Master Charles A. French in command.\n\nThe following day, \"Whitehead\" reached Hampton Roads and joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She sailed for the North Carolina coast on 28 December 1861 and arrived at Hatteras Inlet on 4 January 1862.\n\nDuring the next few months, the steamer \"Whitehead\" carried out extensive operations against Confederate vessels and shore installations in the sounds and rivers of North Carolina. On 7–8 February, she helped to capture Roanoke Island. On 10 February, \"Whitehead\" took schooner \"M. C. Etheridge\" on the Pasquotank River. On 10 April, she made prizes of schooners \"Comet\" and \"J. J. Crittendon\" and of sloop \"America\" in Newbegun Creek.

On 3 October, , and \"Whitehead\" entered the Blackwater River and fired on Rebel troops for over six hours before a barricade placed across the channel necessitated retreat. One of \"Whitehead\"'s sailors, Ordinary Seaman Edwin Smith, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during this engagement.\n\n\"Whitehead\" soon returned to Pamlico Sound but was ordered north on 16 November 1862 for repairs at the Washington Navy Yard. At this time, 3-inch iron plate was placed over her guns and around her pilot house. Back in fighting trim, \"Whitehead\" returned to North Carolina late in December 1862.\n\nHer first noteworthy action came early in the spring of 1863 when she helped to lift the Confederate siege of Washington, North Carolina, which lasted from 31 March to 16 April. On 6–7 July, \"Whitehead\", \"Commodore Perry\", and bombarded and occupied Williamston, North Carolina. \"Whitehead\" captured several prisoners during an expedition up the Pasquotank River on 14 August 1863 and destroyed a Confederate corn mill on the Roanoke River on 22 February 1864. On 1–2 March 1864, \"Whitehead\" and \"Southfield\" sailed up the Chowan River and freed USS \"Bombshell\" from her encirclement by Confederate shore batteries.\n\n\"Whitehead\" encountered the formidable Confederate ram CSS \"Albemarle\" on three occasions. In the early morning hours of 19 April 1864, , , \"Southfield\" and \"Whitehead\" engaged the ram in the Roanoke River. All received damage, and \"Southfield\" was sunk. Darkness prevented \"Whitehead\" from returning \"Albemarle\"s fire. As a result of this costly Union naval defeat, Plymouth, North Carolina fell to Confederate troops the next day.\n\nUnion vessels, including \"Whitehead\", again fought \"Albemarle\" on 5 May 1864. This three-hour Battle of Albemarle Sound was inconclusive, and the ram withdrew up the Roanoke. \"Whitehead\" battled \"Albemarle\" a third time on 24 May 1864. A shell from \"Whitehead\" exploded near the ram's stern and caused the dreaded Confederate warship to withdraw.\n\n\"Whitehead\" resumed routine patrol and reconnaissance duty soon after this. On 12 July 1864, she ascended the Scuppernong River to Columbia, North Carolina, and burned a bridge used to transport supplies to Southern troops at Plymouth. \"Whitehead\" and steamers \"Thomas Colyer\" and \"Massasoit\" joined in an expedition up the Chowan River on 28 July 1864, capturing steamer \"Arrow\" and a large quantity of cotton and tobacco on 29 July at Gatesville, North Carolina. \"Whitehead\" proceeded to the Norfolk Navy Yard for repairs on 20 August 1864. She completed these in time for her to participate in the recapture of Plymouth on 31 October 1864.\n\nFor the closing months of the Civil War, \"Whitehead\", but for occasional runs to Norfolk, Virginia for supplies, patrolled the inland waters of North Carolina. She was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 29 June 1865 and was sold at public auction there on 10 August 1865.

He was dismissed from ministry in the Adventist church in 1980, following his critique of the church's investigative judgment teaching. He had since worked through the non-denominational evangelical ministry Good News Unlimited.\nFord disagreed with some aspects of traditional Adventist end-time beliefs. However, he still defended a conservative view of scripture, the Seventh-day Sabbath, and a vegetarian lifestyle. He viewed the writings of Ellen G. White as useful devotionally, but not at the level of authority held by the Church.\n\nFord shared the sermon time at the Good News Unlimited congregation, which meets on Saturdays in the Brisbane suburb of Milton, and in periodic seminars on the eastern seaboard of Australia.\n\nDesmond Ford was born in Townsville, Queensland, Australia on 2 February 1929, to Wilfred Ford and Lillian Simpson. He had one brother, Val, who was three and a half years older. The Ford lineage consisted of farmers and cattlemen of English and Australian descent. The Simpson lineage derived from England, Ireland and China. Desmond's parents were nominal Anglican Christians, with his father almost an atheist in practice, and his mother presenting \"a religious façade.\" Wilfred encouraged his son to read, beginning a lifelong obsession for the \"unusually gifted\" boy.\n\nWhen Lillian was pregnant with Desmond, an Adventist book salesman shared insights on nutrition with the family, sparking a chain of events affecting Desmond's life. At an Adventist camp meeting in 1939 Desmond was given a Bible, which he would complete 3 years later, around the time he finished primary school. However his parents divorced when he was nine; Wilfred moved to Canberra, and Lillian and the boys later moved to Sydney, New South Wales (NSW). He passed his Intermediate Certificate in 1943. However, due to the family's poverty and Australia's involvement in World War II, Desmond had to drop out of school. He became officially employed with Associated Newspapers at the age of 15, although he had started working there months earlier, and was promoted from copy boy to an editorial position, because of his published work. Meanwhile, Desmond took night classes for high school. All along, Desmond was being influenced by encounters with Adventists and other Christians, and steadily collected books on Christian theology, and the creation-evolution controversy.\n\nFord was challenged by the strict lifestyle standards presented in Ellen G. White's \"Messages to Young People\", and gave up the cinema and reading fiction. Reading novels had been his main childhood hobby, and became replaced with reading theology. White's book \"The Great Controversy\" was a key influence on his conversion. In winter 1946 he publicly responded to a call for commitment to God's service. Ford was impressed by the Christian character of many of the Adventists who had nurtured him. In September he was officially baptised into the church. This was despite strong opposition from his brother; and his mother was also originally resistant to his conversion, having become disenchanted with the Adventist church herself. Ford resigned from his job, and returned briefly to Townsville with his family. He then left in 1947 for the Australasian Missionary College (nicknamed \"Avondale\", and later known as Avondale College) in the Lake Macquarie region of NSW, to train for the ministry.\n\nFord found his time at Avondale an exciting for mental and spiritual growth. He was an active participant in class discussions, and occasionally taught classes to fill in for the lecturers. He was particularly inspired by Dr. William Murdoch, and carried out research for him. Ford gave talks in nearby churches, and published around a dozen articles for church magazines during this time. He also led students in Bible study. He struggled financially, and worked on Avondale's farm and elsewhere, and also selling Adventist books.\n\nHe graduated from the Ministerial Course in Avondale in 1950, with high marks.\n\nFord lived in a caravan (trailer) with his mother, who insisted on accompanying him, while canvassing (selling Christian books). Ford was sent to help build a new church in the coastal town of Coffs Harbour, NSW. In 1951, still in his first year of service as a pastor, he was sent to Newcastle, NSW, then an industrial city, to assist evangelist George Burnside. While Burnside was a dynamic presenter, Ford's biographer Milton Hook describes him as a fundamentalist (see: historic Adventism), and draws an analogy with a rugged, gung-ho cowboy, like a John Wayne character. Ford questioned him on some end-times interpretations, resulting in conflict between the pair – a sign of further things to come. Later he sold books in the Lake Macquarie and nearby Upper Hunter regions, which he found challenging work.\n\nHe worked as a pastor in various churches and as an evangelist for about 7 years in NSW, in Australian rural towns.\n\nIn 1952 Ford pastored the Coffs Harbour area, under a supervisor. His mother returned to Queensland. In December he married Gwen Booth, with whom he had shared a budding friendship and romance since their meeting at Avondale, where she studied teaching. Gwen had been raised in humble circumstances in Yass, and was a quiet achiever who cared about others, and had a deep faith in Jesus. The following year they moved to the country town of Quirindi, where Ford pastored the church. From 1954 to mid-1955, Ford pastored in the Gunnedah area, then moved north to Inverell. There a public debate with Burgin, a Church of Christ minister and a \"formidable opponent\" of Adventists, brought Ford respect. The topic was the Sabbath, with the specific title \"Is the Seventh Day or the First Day Binding on Christians?\" Arguably Ford won the debate. He later baptised some of Burgin's church members.\n\nThe South Pacific Division called him back to Avondale, to complete his ministry course. He completed a BA in 1958, and went on to complete a Master's degree in systematic theology at the SDA Washington Seminary in 1959. Ford subsequently received a PhD in the rhetorical analysis of Paul's letters from Michigan State University in 1961. In the same year he returned to Australia and became head of the Religion Department at Avondale College, where he would remain until 1977. At Avondale, Ford taught many classes, including public speaking, homiletics, and evangelism. He was a member of the Biblical Research Committee in Australia and the United States.\n\nHe completed his second PhD in 1972 from the University of Manchester, while on leave from teaching at Avondale. His supervisor was the renowned Protestant theologian F. F. Bruce. His field was New Testament studies, specifically eschatology (end times). Ford entitled his thesis, \"The Abomination of Desolation in Biblical Eschatology\". His main expertise has been biblical apocalyptic literature, such as Daniel and Revelation, and eschatology.\n\nFord was a primary opponent of the perfectionism within the SDA church, especially its form as taught by fellow Australian Robert Brinsmead, a former classmate of Ford's at Avondale.\n\nFord believed that victory over the guilt of sin (justification) was provided at the cross, victory over the power of sin (sanctification) is the work of a lifetime and victory over the presence of sin (glorification) occurs at the return of Christ Jesus. Ford disagreed with the belief of sinless perfection, and did not hold to the belief that the saints are sealed at the end time, but held that the final removal of sin occurred when mortality changes to immortality at the return of Jesus Christ. Ford held that victory over the presence of sin does not occur during this lifetime, so sin continues among the saints up to the return of Jesus Christ.\n\nFord held that justification precedes sanctification, because victory over the guilt of sin, precedes victory over the power of sin. Ford taught that while justification is distinct from sanctification, the two concepts are always found together, in the same manner as two railway lines are distinct but never separate. Adventist belief places an equal emphasis on sanctification compared to justification, while still believing both are necessary for salvation.\n\nFord disagreed strongly with the belief of \"eschatological perfectionism,\" which is the teaching that a final generation of believers must achieve a state of complete sinlessness (or Christlikeness) in the final period just before the second coming of Jesus, when the saints are sealed (see Last Generation Theology). Mainstream Adventists consider the life and character of Christ as a perfect example, that all must imitate.\n\nFord stepped into the debate within Adventism concerning the nature of Jesus Christ, specifically whether Jesus Christ took on a fallen or an unfallen human nature in the Incarnation. This was precipitated by the publication of \"Questions on Doctrine\" in 1957, which some Adventists felt did not agree with what the church held.\n\nThe debate revolves around the interpretation of several biblical texts:\n\nand statements made by Ellen White:\n\nAccording to Adventist historian George Knight, most early Adventists (until 1950) believed that Jesus Christ was born with a human nature that was not only physically frail and subject to temptation, but that he also had the fallen predisposition and inclination to sin. Since 1950, the \"historic\" wing of the church continues to hold this \"fallen\" view of Christ's human nature. Mainstream Adventist hold to the belief taught by Ellen White that He came with the effects of Adam's sin deep within his nature, that Christ took on the fallen nature but not the sinfulness of man.\n\nIn contrast to the \"historic\" view, Ford believed that Ellen White was clear that Christ took our infirmities and with the weaknesses of fallen man, the sinful nature in the sense of that he had a lessened capacity with respect to the fallen physical nature that he inherited from Adam, including physical weaknesses, frailties and mental, and moral degeneracy and deterioration. While Christ was tempted as all other human beings are, Ford noted that the lessened capacity of his human nature did not ever include giving in to temptation or having any evil desires or propensity or predisposition towards sin in his \"spiritual\" nature, a position with which Ellen White taught and mainstream Adventists agree.\n\nAccording to Anglican Geoffrey Paxton, during the 1960s scholars such as Ford and Edward Heppenstall began to try to highlight a shift in the concept of original sin within the SDA church, away from its foundational belief that Seventh-day Adventists do not believe in original sin.\n\nSeventh-day Adventists have historically preached a doctrine of inherited weakness, but not a doctrine of inherited guilt. Ellen White and others such as George Storrs, and Uriah Smith were disposed to de-emphasise the corrupt nature inherited from Adam, instead stressing the importance of actual, personal sins committed by the individual. Adventists traditionally understand sins of commission as the transgression of God's law, either wilfully or in ignorance. They base their belief on texts such as \"Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.\" (1 John 3:4) Progressive Adventists add to this with some form of original sin.\n\nFord in turning Brinsmead from his belief in sinless perfection, urged Brinsmead to study the Reformers. As a result, Brinsmead ultimately rejected perfectionism. Around 1970, there was a major controversy amongst Australian Adventists over whether \"righteousness by faith\" included both justification and sanctification. This had been sparked by Brinsmead, and Ford became caught up in it. Tensions over Ford and the theology teaching at Avondale more generally, led to a meeting of Australian church leaders on 3–4 February 1976 to hear accusations by a group of \"Concerned Brethren\". Ford's understanding of righteousness by faith was the main issue, while the report mentions \"the Sanctuary, the Age of the Earth and Inspiration.\" In April a group of church leaders and theologians, including Ford met in Palmdale, California, to discuss the meaning of righteousness by faith. Ford was the \"center of attention.\" The resulting document was titled the \"Palmdale Statement\".\n\nIn response to criticisms of his theology, in 1977 the church moved him to the United States, where he taught Religion at Pacific Union College for three years. The classes he taught included the life and teachings of Christ, the Pauline epistles, Christian apologetics, Daniel and Revelation, the major and minor prophets of the Old Testament, introduction to theology, and biblical theology.\n\nIn October 1979 Ford was invited to address a chapter meeting of the Association of Adventist Forums (now Adventist Forums) held at the College, on the topic of Hebrews 9 and its implications for the Adventist investigative judgment teaching. The talk was titled, \"The Investigative Judgment: Theological Milestone or Historical Necessity?\" The talk criticized aspects of the traditional understanding and Ford instead suggested an \"apotelesmatic\" understanding, arguing that Ellen White had such an understanding. Already a controversial figure, Ford's talk appeared to many to be an attack upon fundamental church beliefs. Ford was summoned to the General Conference headquarters in Washington, D.C. He was given six months to write up his views. Late in 1979, he stopped lecturing and moved to Takoma Park, Maryland to research and produce the 991-page manuscript, \"Daniel 8:14, the Day of Atonement, and the Investigative Judgment.\"\nWhile Ford was in basic agreement with the position of the Adventist Church and the majority of Christendom on the atonement, which declares Christ's \"sacrifice in behalf of man was full and complete\" and \"On the cross the penalty for human sin was fully paid\" and with other Adventists as seeing Christ's work in the heavenly sanctuary as the application of the benefits of His already completed work on the cross, Ford directly challenged traditional Adventist views of how to interpret prophecy and how to view the fulfillment of the Day of Atonement by Christ in a way that appeared to completely undermine the denomination's historical reason for existence. Nevertheless, Ford insisted at the start of his manuscript \"The present writer has as his intent the defense of the church.\"\n\nIn August 1980, a group of Adventist theologians and administrators convened at Glacier View Ranch in Colorado to examine Ford's views. According to \"TIME\" magazine, he \"made the case that White's 'sanctuary' explication of 1844 no longer stood up, and that 'investigative judgment' undercut the belief in salvation by God's grace apart from good works.\" The culmination of this event was Ford losing his employment with the denomination as a minister and theology professor. After counsel from the General Conference, the Australasian Division withdrew \"Ford's ministerial credentials.\"\n\nFord's mentor, Edward Heppenstall, saw him as moving in some theological areas that his mentor could not agree with. Heppenstall was disappointed when he failed to dissuade Ford from his position at Glacier View, subsequently writing to him that he \"was shocked at how far\" he \"had swung to the left Biblically and doctrinally\".\n\nTo commemorate the 30th anniversary of Glacier View, the Sydney Adventist Forum held a pretend courtroom trial to assess the accuracy of Ford's claim that the Consensus Document has been largely in agreement with him. They concluded, \"Ford was found to be substantially correct in claiming that the 114-member Sanctuary Review Committee (SRC) Consensus Document was in agreement with his twelve propositions—while \"Ministry\" was judged to have considerably over-stated its case.\" It concluded, \"In retrospect, it is clear that the SRC made—in five days—more progress in understanding this biblical doctrine than the church has typically made in any fifty years of its history.\"\n\nIn 1980, following Ford's dismissal from the Adventist ministry and professorship, a group of Pacific Union College students along with others at Andrews University founded a sympathetic unofficial journal, entitled \"Evangelica\", in 1980. A group of professors at the college also expressed their displeasure with the General Conference and its then president, Neal C. Wilson, by writing parodies of certain Adventist hymns, an event which became notorious in conservative Adventist circles as the \"singing incident\". Further Note: All participants in the unofficial journal \"Evangelica\" were fired.\n\nAfter being dismissed from the ministry, Desmond Ford chose to remain a member of the Seventh-day Adventist church. He founded an interdenominational Christian ministry named Good News Unlimited, which gave him a platform to continue preaching. In 2000, he retired and moved back to Australia from America; in retirement, he continued his association with both Good News Unlimited and the Seventh-day Adventist Church.\n\nFord married Gwen Booth, with whom he had three children – Elènne Gwen Ford (born 29 October 1955), Paul Wesley Ford (born 20 December 1957) and Luke Ford (born 1966). Gwen died of breast cancer in April 1970. Ford married Gillian Wastell (\"Gill\") in November of that year. Elènne works as a barrister. She also owns the \"Mango Hill Farm\" organic farm attraction on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, which includes farmstays, a small function centre, cooking school, etc. It is located in Peachester, and for some years was the location of Ford's twice-a-month Gospel fellowships. Luke converted to Orthodox Judaism and is a controversial blogger.\n\nFord's biography, written by Milton Hook, was published in 2008.\n\nDesmond Ford died on 3 March 2019 in Sunshine Coast, Queensland.\n\nFord has written around 30 books and numerous articles.\n\n\nAlso:\n\n"}

The location of the spring is unknown: speculation has centered on Apulia, the poet's birthplace, and the neighborhood of an archaeological ruin east of Rome, thought to be the site of poet's beloved Sabine farm in what is now the commune of Licenza. In the poem Horace promises to sacrifice a young goat to the spring and praises the spring's constancy in the hottest days of summer. The poem ends with Horace promising to immortalize the spring through his song.\n\nEvidence that the original \"Fons Bandusiae\" may have been located in Apulia, near Horace's childhood home, comes from a papal bull of Paschal II, dating to 1103. This bull mentions a \"church of the Holy Martyrs Gervasius and Protasius at the Bandusine spring in Venusia\" (\"ecclesia sanctorum martyrum Gervasii et Protasii in Bandusino fonte apud Venusiam\"). Travelers have proposed the village of Palazzo San Gervasio, 13 km east of Venusia, as the probable location of the church but failed to match any of the nearby springs with Horace's description. Recent scholarship suggests that Horace may have named a pleasant spring near his Sabine farm after a similar spring in the vicinity of his native Venusia.\n\n"}

Condé is best known for her novel \"Ségou\" (1984–85). \n\nHer novels explore the African diaspora that resulted from slavery and colonialism in the Caribbean. Her novels written in French, have been translated into English, German, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese. She has won various awards, such as the \"Grand prix littéraire de la Femme\" (1986), \"Prix de L’Académie francaise\" (1988),Prix Carbet de la Carraibe (1997) and the \"New Academy Prize in Literature\" (2018) for her works.\n\nBorn as Maryse Boucolon at Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe, she was the youngest of eight children. In an interview entitled \"I Have Made Peace With My Island\" Maryse Condé recounts aspects of her early life. Condé describes her parents as among the first black instructors in Guadeloupe. Condé's mother, Jeanne Quidal directed her own school for girls. Condé's father, Auguste Boucolon previously an educator, founded the small bank \"Le Caisse Coopérative des prêts\" which was later renamed as \"La Banque Antillaise.\"\n\nCondé's father, Auguste Boucolon had two sons from his first marriage, Serge and Albert. Condé's three sisters are named Ena, Jeanne and Gillette. Her four brothers are named Auguste, Jean, René, and Guy. Condé's birth 11 years after Guy, made her the youngest of the eight children. Condé was born while her mother was 43, and her father was 63. Condé's describes herself as \"the spoiled child\", which she attributes to her parents older age, and the age-gap between her and her siblings.\n\nCondé began writing at an early age. Before the age of 12 she had written a one-act, one-person play. The play was written as a gift for her mother Jeanne Quidal's birthday.\n\nAfter having graduated from high school, she attended Lycée Fénelon from 1953 to 1955. Condé was expelled after two years of attendance. Condé instead furthered her studies at the Université de Paris III (Sorbonne Nouvelle) in Paris. During her attendance, she along with other West Indians, established the Luis-Carlos Prestes club. \n\nIn 1959, Condé attended a rehearsal of \"Les Négres/ The Blacks\" by Jean Genêt, where she would meet the Guinean actor Mamadou Condé. In August 1959 she married Mamadou Condé. They eventually had four children together. By November 1959 the couple's relationship became strained, and Condé moved to the Ivory Coast, where she would teach for a year.\n\nDuring Condé's returns for the holidays she became politically conscious through a group of Marxist friends. Condé's marxist friends would influence her to move to Ghana. \n\nBetween the years 1960 and 1972 she taught in Guinea, Ghana (from where she was deported in the 1960s because of politics), and Senegal. \n\nIn 1973 she returned to Paris, and taught Francophone literature at Paris VII (Jussieu), X (Nanterre), and . In 1975, she completed her M.A. and Ph.D. at the Sorbonne Nouvelle in Paris in comparative literature, examining black stereotypes in Caribbean literature.\n\nIn 1981, she and Condé divorced, having long been separated. The following year she married Richard Philcox, the English-language translator of most of her novels.\n\nShe did not publish her first novel, \"Hérémakhonon\" until she was nearly 40 because \"[she] didn't have confidence in [herself] and did not dare present [her] writing to the outside world.\" However, Condé would not reach her current prominence as a contemporary Caribbean writer until the publication of her third novel, \"Ségou\" (1984).\n\nFollowing the success of \"Ségou\", in 1985 Condé was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to teach in the US. She became a professor of French and Francophone literature at Columbia University in New York City in 1995.\n\nCondé has taught at various universities, including the University of California, Berkeley; UCLA, the Sorbonne, The University of Virginia, and the University of Nanterre. She retired from teaching in 2005.\n\nCondé's novels explore racial, gender and cultural issues in a variety of historical eras and locales, including the Salem witch trials in \"\" (1986); the 19th-century Bambara Empire of Mali in \"Ségou\" (1984-1985); and the 20th-century building of the Panama Canal and its influence on increasing the West Indian middle class in \"The Tree of Life\" (1992). Her novels trace the relationships between African peoples and the diaspora, especially the Caribbean.\n\nHer first novel \"Hérémakhonon\", was published in 1976. It was so controversial that it was pulled from the shelves after six months because of its criticism over the success of African socialism. While the story closely parallels Condé's own life during her first stay in Guinea, and is written as a first-person narrative, she stresses that it is not an autobiography. The book is the story, as she described it, of an \"'anti-moi', an ambiguous persona whose search for identity and origins is characterized by a rebellious form of sexual libertinage\".\n\nShe has kept considerable distance from most Caribbean literary movements, such as Negritude and Creolité, and has often focused on topics with strong feminist and political concerns. A radical activist in her work as well as in her personal life, Condé has admitted: \"I could not write anything... unless it has a certain political significance. I have nothing else to offer that remains important.\"\n\nCondé's later writings have become increasingly autobiographical, such as 2001's \"Tales From the Heart: True Stories From My Childhood\" and 2006's \"Victoire\", a fictional biography of her maternal grandmother in which she explores themes of motherhood, femininity, race relations, and the family dynamic in the postcolonial Caribbean. 2004's \"Who Slashed Celanire's Throat\" shows traces of Condé's paternal great-grandmother.\n\nHowever, her 2008 novel \"Windward Heights\", is a reworking of Emily Brontë’s \"Wuthering Heights,\" which she had first read at the age of 14. Condé had long wanted to create a work around it, as an act of \"homage.\" Her novel is set in Guadeloupe, and race and culture are featured as issues that divide people. Reflecting on how she drew from her Caribbean background in writing this book, she said: \n\"To be part of so many worlds—part of the African world because of the African slaves, part of the European world because of the European education—is a kind of double entendre. You can use that in your own way and give sentences another meaning. I was so pleased when I was doing that work, because it was a game, a kind of perverse but joyful game.\"\n\nAmong her plays are: \n\n\nMaryse Condé's literary archive (Maryse Condé Papers) are held at Columbia University Libraries.\n\nFor her works Conde's has been awarded :\n\n\nIn 2001, she was named a Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government. In 2018, Condé became the first recipient of the New Academy Prize in Literature.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2173625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173625", "title": "Mega Man Zero 4", "text": "Mega Man Zero 4\n\nMega Man Zero 4 is a video game developed by Inti Creates and Natsume and published in 2005 by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld. It is the fourth and final installment of the \"Mega Man Zero\" subseries of the \"Mega Man\" franchise and is set several months after the events of \"Mega Man Zero 3\". The game deals with Dr. Weil's reign over Neo Arcadia in which humans, who have been reduced to second-rate citizens, begin to escape in large numbers to the last-known livable location on the planet, Area Zero, beginning a conflict between the two groups. The effects of this war eventually drive Zero and the Resistance to protect Area Zero and its inhabitants from Dr. Weil.\n\nSince it's original release, it has been brought to the Nintendo DS family of systems as part of the \"Mega Man Zero Collection\" in 2010 and the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2016. In February 2020, it was released on PC (Steam), Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One as part of the \"Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection\".\n\nSeveral months after the destruction of Omega, Dr. Weil has assumed a dictatorial reign of Neo Arcadia, forcing many humans to flee. In response, Dr. Weil labels the escapees as Mavericks and begins to purge them as if they were Reploids.\n\nMeanwhile, a fleeing caravan led by a human journalist named Neige is attacked by Dr. Weil's army. Zero, Ciel and a small band of Resistance fighters happen upon them and come to their aid. Neige explains they were en route to Area Zero, the crash site of the space colony Eurasia and one of the last natural habitats on Earth that can support human life. Shortly after parting ways, Zero learns of a plot called \"Operation Ragnarok\", meant to destroy all environments outside of Neo Arcadia in order to force humans to return and live under Dr. Weil's rule. Helping Dr. Weil on his quest are a group of violent Reploids called the Eight Einherjar Warriors. They are led by a military Reploid named Craft, who has a romantic history with Neige, thus creating many conflicting thoughts within him.\n\nAfter defeating four of the Einherjar Warriors, Area Zero comes under attack by Neo Arcadia. Zero defends it and is forced to battle Craft. Neige breaks up the fight, but she is kidnapped by Craft, who escapes. Zero chases him to a prison where Neige is held and eventually rescues her.\n\nLater, Zero eliminates the remaining Einherjar Warriors, but Ciel intercepts a radio message from Dr. Weil. He announces he is going to use Ragnarok, an orbiting satellite weapon, to wipe out Area Zero.\nBefore Weil can use it, Craft rebels and fires Ragnarok at Neo Arcadia in an attempt to kill Dr. Weil, which leaves the city in ruins. Zero, deeming Craft to be too dangerous, defeats him, and Craft succumbs to his wounds.\n\nRagnarok moves on a crash course for Area Zero, and Zero makes his way there to find that Dr. Weil somehow survived the destruction of Neo Arcadia. Dr. Weil reveals that while he is human, he was made into a bionic-reploid hybrid by the same people who exiled Omega and himself into space at the end of the Elf Wars. His new body is incapable of aging or dying, as it constantly repairs and upgrades itself. Believing he can survive the impact of the crash and personally oversee the destruction of Area Zero, Dr. Weil fuses with the Ragnarok core, and later the remnants of the station itself, and attacks Zero. After an intense battle and the destruction of Dr. Weil's fused body, Ragnarok breaks apart, leaving Zero no means of escape.\n\nCiel runs through Area Zero where she learns that Zero did not teleport back. \nHeartbroken and distraught, Ciel runs away and ends up on top of a hill, where she breaks down in tears while pieces of Ragnarok burn through the atmosphere. Afterwards, she stands up and expresses her faith in Zero, hoping that he'll return someday while promising to carry on his mission of maintaining peace between humans and Reploids. The final scene shows a picture of Zero's shattered helmet somewhere in the desert.\n\nThe fourth installment of the \"Mega Man Zero\" series introduces gameplay changes, but does not deviate from the platforming of its predecessors. Players guide Zero through eight main selectable stages, which are usually separated into two parts by a mini-boss battle. At the end of each level, the player faces one of the game's reploid antagonists.\n\n\"Mega Man Zero 4\" includes a new Easy Mode, not found in its prequels, in response to criticisms that the Mega Man Zero series had become too challenging. In Easy Mode, Zero receives a large life boost and can use the Cyber Elf without restrictions. However, Easy Mode prevents the changing of the weather, and consequentially the acquiring of EX Skills.\n\nZero is still equipped with the Buster Shot and Z-Saber at default. However, in place of the Shield Boomerang and the rod-type weapon from the previous games (i.e.: Triple Rod, Chain Rod and Recoil Rod) is the new Z-Knuckle. This device allows Zero to perform several actions, including hanging from pipes, destroying obstacles, stealing an enemy's weapon (if Zero destroys it using the Z-Knuckle) and acquiring special weapons in certain parts of a stage.\nAnother new element is the weather system, which allows players to choose between two weather conditions for each of the eight main stages. The difficulty of the stage varies depending on the chosen weather condition, with the stage being harder if the weather icon has an orange border around it. Sometimes, there are secret passages in some stages which the player can only reach by setting the weather to \"hard\". The trade-off for an easier level is that Zero cannot learn an EX Skill from a boss.\n\nCyber Elves, a core element of previous \"Mega Man Zero\" installments, are small helpers who can assist Zero in combat. Shortly after the introductory levels, a Cyber Elf will arrive for Zero to equip. This elf has most of the powers of Cyber Elves from previous games, which are unlocked as the player raises its level by feeding it E-Crystals. Zero may select one power from each of three categories: Nurse, Animal, and Hacker. The player's ranking at the end of a level is no longer given a penalty for using the Cyber Elves as long as they are kept under the maximum power limit. In addition to this, Zero can now equip body chips to enhance his abilities, including double-jumping and self-recovery, similar to early \"Mega Man X\" titles.\n\nZero cannot rely on finding secret disks to give him enhancements as in \"Mega Man Zero 3\". Instead, players must collect parts dropped randomly from defeated enemies. Recipes for combining these parts can be obtained from NPCs the player rescues or a Cyber Elf after its stages of evolution. However, the majority of the recipes are found through experimentation with combinations of parts.\n\nAnother distinguishing feature of this installment is that Neige and Ciel have different faces depending on their emotion. For instance, after Zero \"dies\", Ciel is sitting near a tree and tells a promise that saddens her and brightens her. Neige also has an angry face, one that Ciel lacks.\n\n\"Mega Man Zero 4\" has multiple modes. Easy Mode and Normal Mode are available from the start. Easy Mode makes the game easier to play, but prevents changing the weather conditions or acquiring EX Skills.\n\nAfter completing the game once on Normal Mode, players can access an additional Hard Mode or start a new game over the old one. There is also an Ultimate Mode, which can only be unlocked when certain criteria are met. Like the previous game, there are seven mini-games that can be unlocked once certain criteria are met. They are as follows:\n\n\nCapcom Japan's announcement of a sequel to \"Mega Man Zero 3\" was anticipated, following the pattern of development news from the previous two \"Mega Man Zero\" games. Capcom updated its official site quietly with information stating that the game would have an April 2005 release in Japan.\n\n\"Mega Man Zero 4\" has an average of 77% on Metacritic and GameRankings, making it roughly the 85th best-ranking Game Boy Advance title.\n\"Mega Man Zero 4\" entered Japanese sales charts at number eight during its release week. According to Media Create sales information, \"Mega Man Zero 4\" was the 177th best-selling video game in Japan in 2005 at approximately 74,354 copies.\n\n\"Mega Man Zero 4\" has been called a \"refined version of an outstanding platformer series\" with a more streamlined weapon and Cyber Elf system. Critics were quick to state that it hadn't changed much and that it was \"more of the same\". One reviewer, however, stated that the level designs were \"slightly less challenging\" than those of previous installations, but more inventive.\n\nThe simplified Cyber Elf system received mixed reviews. GameSpot thought the new single Cyber Elf was an improvement, while Jeremy Parish of 1up.com stated that it signalled a return \"to the old-fashion Mega Man game structure\", which he found \"unfortunate since the Zero games' greatest strength was their willingness to break the trite and true Mega Man mold\".\n\nCritics were mostly neutral about the weather system, saying that diehard players wouldn't make use of the system. It was seen as a nice idea, but the effects weren't \"pronounced enough to make most levels worth playing through twice\".\n"}

They are best known for their #1 US dance hit, \"Cherchez La Femme/Se Si Bon\", from their self-titled debut album.\n\nThe band was conceived by half-brothers Stony Browder Jr. (February 7, 1949 – October 6, 2001) and Thomas Browder (also known as August Darnell, born August 12, 1950), with the former writing music and the latter lyrics. They started the band in 1974 with singer Cory Daye (born April 25, 1952), drummer Mickey Sevilla, and percussionist Andy Hernandez (Coati Mundi). They released three albums between 1976 and 1979. Their music blended disco beats with rhythms from genres including calypso, rhumba, cha-cha-chá, and compas. The Browders, who were both multiracial, wrote songs embracing multiculturalism over stories about tragic mulattoes. A smaller lineup known as Dr. Buzzard's Savannah Band (omitting the word \"original\") also released a fourth album in 1984. They were frequent performers at Studio 54.

This release was the last recorded output to feature vocalist Anders Fridén, later of In Flames, who was fired and replaced by then rhythm guitarist, Mikael Stanne. Incidentally, Mikael Stanne was the lead vocalist on the first In Flames studio album, \"Lunar Strain\".\n\nThe album was re-released in 1999 by Century Media Records as \"Skydancer/Of Chaos and Eternal Night\". It was also remastered and reissued later in 2013 in celebration of the album's twentieth anniversary.<ref name=\"decibel 9/2013\"></ref>\n\nSundin described \"Skydancer\" as \"unique\" within the band's catalogue due to its \"weirdness and eccentricity\", which caused him to look back on the album as \"more of an acquired taste rather than a breakthrough release.\" When asked how far the band has come since the release of this album, Niklas Sundin stated:\n\nSundin recalled \"a real sense of excitement throughout the songwriting process, and it felt like we really were onto something new and original that we needed to capture on tape and let people listen to as soon as possible.\"\n\nSundin, while noting that the band were well prepared, recalled that \"studio recordings back then were always stressful. Our budget only allowed for ten studio days for recording and mixing, so there wasn't any time to fine-tune things, and we often had to use first takes even if they weren't perfect. There was a good idea of we wanted to accomplish, but we lacked the studio knowledge to communicate it to the engineers, who in turn were clueless about extreme metal, so there were lots of tension and misunderstandings.\"\n\nNiklas Sundin observed that the album was not properly remastered at the time of the 2000 edition, and indicated that the twentieth anniversary edition would mark the first proper mastering of the album. Describing the production as \"the weak point\" of \"Skydancer\", and qualifying that \"there are limits to what one can do without access to the separate instrument tracks,\" he expressed his opinion that \"everything sounds much better now. The album is so old that there wasn't even any proper mastering done the first time around; all songs had a different output volume and are sonically very incoherent.\"\n\n\"Skydancer\" has received generally positive reviews, although the album's marked departure from later material has been met with some critical barbs. For instance, writing for Allmusic, Jared Anderson criticized the \"generally fractured and unfocused\" arrangements and \"shifting tempos, rhythms, and time signatures\" for \"limit[ing] the album's appeal\". Conversely, Sputnik Music praised the album for its \"awesome song writing and flawless execution\", which the critic suggested is the first melodic death metal album.\"\n\nReflecting upon \"Skydancer\", a \"retro review\" by About.com described it as a \"dark horse\" in the band's catalogue, \"even more so than the controversial \"Projector\". Describing the album as \"primitive\" and featuring an \"underwhelming\" performance by Anders Fridén, the reviewer nonetheless praised the \"sense of adventurism\".\n\nAll arrangements by Dark Tranquillity\n\n\n\n"}

By 18, he was managing the Dexter. From there he went on to become assistant manager of the Fox Theatre (also in Detroit) — a theater featuring 5200 seats. After a tour of duty with the Marines, Cohen became sales manager for Columbia Pictures in the Detroit Area and moved to Hollywood to work for the publicity department of Columbia in the 1940s. In the 1950s he started producing films, first working as assistant (and later associate) producer for Jack Broder and Realart Pictures on such films as \"Bride of the Gorilla\", \"Battles of Chief Pontiac\" (featuring Lon Chaney, Jr.), \"Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla\" and \"Kid Monk Baroni\" (featuring a 21-year-old Leonard Nimoy as a street kid turned boxer). He later worked for Allied Artists and United Artists producing such films as \"Target Earth\", \"Magnificent Roughnecks\" (with Mickey Rooney), and \"Crime of Passion\" (with Barbara Stanwyck and Raymond Burr). Cohen also wrote the stories and/or screenplays for at least nine films, co-writing with pal Aben Kandel and sometimes using one pseudonym between them – either \"Ralph Thornton\" or \"Kenneth Langtry\" (Kandel also wrote solo for Cohen on \"Kid Monk Baroni\" and, using the Thornton moniker, on \"Blood of Dracula\").\n\nCohen had greater success in the mid-50s though, with a horror film for American International — \"I Was a Teenage Werewolf\", which he both wrote and produced. The film cost about $100,000 to make, but earned more than $2 million. He also discovered young Michael Landon, cast in the lead role for \"I Was a Teenage Werewolf\". Cohen followed this success by writing and producing more teen horror films, such as \"I Was a Teenage Frankenstein\", \"How to Make a Monster\", and \"Blood of Dracula\". In a 1991 interview with Tom Weaver, Cohen reflected, \"I have always felt that most teenagers think that adults – their parents, or their teacher, anyone who was older and who had authority – were culprits in their lives.\"\n\nCohen also occasionally appeared in his own films, usually as an uncredited extra. He played the director in the projection room in \"How to Make a Monster\", and can also be seen in \"I Was a Teenage Werewolf\", \"Konga\", \"Black Zoo\", \"Crooks and Coronets\", and \"Trog\".\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, he began producing horror films in the United Kingdom, working with such stars as Joan Crawford in \"Berserk!\" and \"Trog\", and Jack Palance in \"Craze\". In 1961, he returned to his roots in Detroit, purchasing the Fox Theater he had worked for in his youth. By the late 1970s, Cohen was working more in writing and distribution than in film production. He founded Cobra Media, a domestic distribution company, in 1981.\n\nCohen died of throat cancer on June 2, 2002.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2173650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173650", "title": "Smokie (band)", "text": "Smokie (band)\n\nSmokie (originally spelt Smokey) are an English rock band from Bradford, Yorkshire. The band found success at home and abroad after teaming up with Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn. They have had a number of line-up changes and were still actively touring in 2018. Their most popular hit single, \"Living Next Door to Alice\", peaked at No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart and, in March 1977, reached No. 25 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Other hit singles include \"If You Think You Know How to Love Me\", \"Oh Carol\", \"Lay Back in the Arms of Someone\", and \"I'll Meet You at Midnight\".\n\nThe band was formed as \"The Yen\" after a chance meeting between Ron Kelly and Alan Silson in Moore's Music Shop, North Parade, Bradford, in October 1963. Two days after that meeting they were joined by Chris Norman for rehearsals, but without finding a suitable bass player, just practiced together for a year. The addition of Terry Uttley on bass guitar at the beginning of 1965 completed the line-up and The Yen's first gig was at Birkenshaw School in February 1965. It was composed of Chris Norman (lead vocals/rhythm guitar), Terry Uttley (bass/vocals), Alan Silson (lead guitar/vocals), and Ron Kelly (drums). They were renamed \"The Sphynx\", and later \"Essence\". As Essence, they toured small clubs in Bradford and the surrounding communities before they split in 1966. The Black Cats were already a working band when Ron Kelly joined them at Dewsbury College in September 1966. The Black Cats at this time were Peter Eastwood on guitar/vocals and Arthur Higgins on bass. Kelly replaced the drummer they had at the time. Alan Silson and Pete Eastwood joined the band, but the latter soon left and was replaced by Chris Norman. In November 1967 the band changed their name to \"The Four Corners\".\n\nIn April 1968, the group found a manager in Mark Jordan, who advised them to rename themselves \"The Elizabethans\". The group now became fully professional, and the members garnered higher salaries. In June 1968, Terry Uttley joined the group as a replacement for Arthur Higgins, who had left the band in order to carry on his education. On 9 December 1968 the group had their first TV appearance on Yorkshire Television's news and magazine show \"Calendar\". In August 1969, the four performed two songs for the BBC show \"High Jinx\". Enthused with this successful performance, Jordan had them record their first demo tape. In January 1970, RCA Records showed an interest in the band and suggested a name change to \"Kindness\". The double A-side \"Light of Love\"/\"Lindy Lou\" was released on 3 April 1970.\n\nAn arrangement was made with Ronnie Storm (no connection to Rory Storm) to back him on the single release \"My Desire\", and it was released under the pseudonym \"Fuzzy and The Barnets\" due to contractual difficulties encountered by Storm. At the same time Steve Rowland, of Family Dogg, heard the band playing live on Radio One Club and offered to sign them to his production company. He arranged for Albert Hammond, who was also in Family Dogg, to write a number for the band, entitled \"It Never Rains in Southern California\". However, before it could be released, Hammond decided to record it himself, for which Kelly was recruited by Steve Rowland to play drums. Hammond wrote other songs for the band, and a single \"You Ring a Bell\"/\"Have You Met Angela\" was recorded, but due to various problems in Rowland's organisation, it was not released. In late 1971 the band's management was taken over by Dave Eager, the BBC Radio One DJ, at the same time that Norman suffered a serious infection that affected his vocal cords. After his recovery, his voice sounded much rougher, which the other group members considered an interesting addition to their sound. Eager introduced them to Decca, which resulted in recordings in February 1972, their first single being \"Oh Julie\"/\"I Love You Carolina\". Shortly thereafter, their next single was released. \"Let the Good Times Roll\" was liked by the media and was selected as the opening theme for Emperor Rosko's BBC Radio One Saturday show, but this popularity did not translate into record sales. The last Decca single was \"Make it Better\"/\"Lonely Long Lady\", which flopped, and their Decca contract was cancelled.\n\nDuring the band's Decca contract, Eager used his contacts with the Manchester-based agency Kennedy Street Enterprises, to gain the band an audition to be Peter Noone's backing band. The band were asked to become his permanent band after their audition at Noone's House in Denham, Buckinghamshire, and soon they embarked on a nationwide tour with him. Noone did not bring the boys any luck, but during the tour Bill Hurley offered to manage them. Hurley convinced Eager to release the boys from the contract with him. Ron Kelly left Kindness on 8 August 1973 and the band recruited an old school friend, Pete Spencer (drums/vocals), who had played in various groups, to drum for them. This line-up performed on a sightseeing boat in Frankfurt, Germany. Hurley introduced the band to composers Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, who also wrote songs for glam rock contemporaries Sweet, Mud, and Suzi Quatro. At first \"Chinnichap\" turned them down, but Hurley's tenacity eventually convinced the composers/producers to give the young group a chance. Hurley and Chinnichap started working with the band, and suggested yet another name change, to \"Smokey\". An attempt to dress the band up in leather clothes (similar to Suzi Quatro) was dropped, and the four won acceptance for their jeans outfit.\n\nThey purchased new instruments and in late 1974 began recording their debut album \"Pass It Around\" which was released 14 February 1975. The album spawned the title track as a single but failed to gain significant attention. In April Smokey opened for Pilot on tour.\n\nOn 22 September 1975, Smokey released their second album, \"Changing All the Time\". The first single from the new album, \"If You Think You Know How to Love Me\", became a hit in many European countries, peaking at No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart. They followed it with \"Don't Play Your Rock 'n' Roll to Me\".\n\nAround this time, Smokey Robinson threatened to file a lawsuit, alleging that the band's name would confuse the audience. In order to avoid legal action, the group changed the spelling to \"Smokie\". They began their first tour as headline act, after the release of their second album.\n\nThe third LP was partly produced in the US, where Nicky Chinn had relocated. Called \"Midnight Café\", it built on the popularity of \"Changing All the Time\". The subsequent years yielded a string of successful singles: \"Something's Been Making Me Blue\", \"Wild Wild Angels\", and \"I'll Meet You At Midnight\". Their cover of Australian band New World's single, \"Living Next Door to Alice\", released in November 1976, reached No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart, followed by another hit \"Lay Back in the Arms of Someone\". Smokie now found themselves European superstars, with sold-out tours and million-selling albums. The next two albums, 1977's \"Bright Lights & Back Alleys\" and \"The Montreux Album\" (1978), cemented their status and were both chart successes. From \"Bright Lights & Back Alleys\" came two hit singles, the reggae influenced \"It's Your Life\" and a cover of \"Needles and Pins\".\n\nAt the peak of Smokie's success in 1978, Chris Norman teamed up with Suzi Quatro and released a duet single, \"Stumblin' In\" — another Chinnichap composition. Norman and Quatro were on top of the European charts for some time, and it reached the US Top 10, though only No. 41 in the UK. Smokie's subsequent 45 was \"Mexican Girl\". Composed by Norman and Spencer, the record saw the group actively distance itself from Chinnichap. Chris Norman and Pete Spencer wrote and produced the British football star Kevin Keegan's first single, \"Head Over Heels in Love\", a No. 31 UK hit.\n\nIn 1979, the album \"The Other Side of the Road\" was released, entirely recorded in Australia. It spawned two more singles for the band, \"Do to Me\" and \"Babe It's Up to You\", but it became clear that their sales were declining.\n\nSmokie took a hiatus before \"Solid Ground\" was released in 1981. The advance single was a cover of Del Shannon's 1963 hit, \"Little Town Flirt\" — but it failed to reach the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIn early 1982, the last album for EMI/BMG was released, \"Strangers in Paradise\". The departure from Chinnichap became notable, and the four members of Smokie appeared unable to recreate their success using their own material. Shortly after the release of \"Strangers In Paradise\", work began on two parallel albums, one released by Smokie as \"Midnight Delight\", and the other Chris Norman's solo debut, \"Rock Away Your Teardrops\". Neither release sold well.\n\nIn 1983, band members Alan Silson, Chris Norman and Terry Uttley collaborated with Agnetha Fältskog, singing together on the track \"Once Burned Twice Shy\" from her first English language solo album entitled \"Wrap Your Arms Around Me\". The band say it was on the flight to record this song in Sweden that they decided to part ways. Chris Norman began his solo career and Terry Uttley went on to play bass for several other groups including Peter Goalby and John Coughlan (ex Status Quo drummer). The band said \"It just seemed like the right thing to do at the time.\"\n\nThough Smokie had begun work on a comeback, in 1986, Norman, by that stage enthused with the relative success of his second solo album, \"Some Hearts Are Diamonds\", announced that he was to leave the band. He was replaced by Alan Barton, formerly of Black Lace, a friend of the band's, who had a vocal style similar to Norman's. Smokie also recruited keyboard player Martin Bullard. Spencer quit and was replaced on drums by Steve Pinnell. The new line-up released \"All Fired Up\" in 1988, which brought some attention and contained a new version of \"Rock Away Your Tear Drops\", the song that had been the title track to Norman's debut album.\n\nSeveral releases followed over the next years including \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" (1989, seven weeks at No. 1 in Norway; all tracks were produced by Simon Humphrey, except \"Young Love\", which was produced by Dieter Bohlen); \"Whose Are These Boots?\" (1990, No. 1 in Norway); \"Chasing Shadows\" (1992); and \"Celebration\" (1994), which contained old hits in new arrangements accompanied by an orchestra. None had any real success in the UK. However, Smokie made a surprise return to the UK Singles Chart in 1995, with a duet with the controversial northern comedian Roy Chubby Brown. The re-worked re-release of \"Living Next Door To Alice (Who the F**k is Alice)\" reached No. 3 in the UK. The band had noticed that, whilst touring in Ireland, whenever they sang the main line \"For 24 years/I've been living next door to Alice\" the audience would shout \"Alice? Who the fuck is Alice?\" In addition, a resident DJ in a Dutch café, Gompie, organised a recording, and had a No. 17 UK hit with the title of \"Alice (Who the X is Alice) (Living Next Door to Alice)\" in the United Kingdom, and in the Netherlands where it reached No. 1.\n\nShortly after the song was recorded Smokie's tour bus careered off of the road during a hailstorm in Germany. Barton, badly injured, died after five days in intensive care. The rest of the band and Brown agreed to donate their royalties from the song to Barton's first wife.\n\nThe remaining members decided to continue with the band and went about finding their third lead singer. Friend of the band Mike Craft was chosen. The band released \"The World and Elsewhere\" later that year, followed by \"Light a Candle — The Christmas Album\".\n\nIn 1996, Alan Silson terminated his membership, saying he intended to pursue a solo career and to work with other acts as well, joining Mickey Finn's T. Rex, and that he also no longer wanted to be on the road all the time. Mick McConnell, one of the band's road crew and their guitar technician replaced him as the group's new lead guitarist, this formation recording the next album, \"Wild Horses – The Nashville Album\" (1998), in Nashville, Tennessee. In February 2001, Smokie released two albums, \"Uncovered\" and \"Uncovered Too\", which consist entirely of cover versions, with no original songs.\n\nIn 2004, Smokie recorded a studio album, \"On the Wire\", with eleven of the 14 songs written by the band themselves. In 2006, the band released the album \"From the Heart\". Although mainly a compilation, it did contain three new tracks.\n\nIn 2010, Smokie gained new chart success with a CD of brand new material, \"Take a Minute\". Released in Denmark in August of that year, it peaked at number three on the Danish Albums Chart. Releases in the remainder of Scandinavia and Germany took place during October, with the single \"Sally's Song (The Legacy Goes On)\"  — a continuation of the story of the other character in \"Living Next Door to Alice\"  — also released.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the opening verse of the Sermon on the Mount, and the section of the sermon known as the Beatitudes.\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 5:3.\n\nThis verse opens the first of nine statements of who is blessed. Each, except for the last, follows the same pattern of naming a group of people and the reward they will receive.\n\nBetz notes that in Jesus' time \"blessed\" was a common way of describing someone who is wealthy. In Andrew's discussion of Croesus in Herodots, for instance, the link between being blessed and being wealthy is assumed. \nSimilarly, Albright and Mann prefer the word \"fortunate\" to \"blessed\" for \"makarios\". \nThey argue that the term has none of the religious implications that the word \"blessed\" today has in the English language. \nKodjak believes that this opening of the sermon was meant to shock the audience, it was a deliberate inversion of standard values. Today the text is so common that its shock value has been lost. While not a mainstream view, Betz feels this Beatitude has important pre-Christian precedents. He traces it back to Socrates' notion of enkrateia, which explained that the philosopher was one who had no interest in wealth. This idea was adopted by the Cynics, who rejected wealth and saw poverty as the only route to freedom. This group, while small, had a wide influence and some of their ideas were embraced by some Jewish communities at the time of Christ.\n\nThe phrase \"poor in spirit\" occurs in the Dead Sea Scrolls, and seems to have been an important notion to the Qumran community. Scholars agree that \"poor in spirit\" does not mean lacking in spirit, be it courage, the Holy Spirit, or religious awareness. Rather it is that poverty is not only a physical condition, but also a spiritual one. In fact, the more self aware a person is of his or her spiritual poverty caused by the innate human condition of the sinful nature, the more one is humbly aware that they are \"poor in spirit\" left to his or her own ways without Jesus Christ as Savior. Without Jesus the Christ alive and active in one's soul, it remains in a completely impoverished spiritual state; once a person declares Jesus as Lord and Savior of his or her life, Jesus sustains them through a daily renewing of their poor spirit: \"Then Jesus declared, 'I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.'\" (John 6:35). \n\nThe important phrase Kingdom of Heaven is generally understood as referring to the Messianic age after the Second Coming.

She is the daughter of Minnie Newsome, a jazz performer who has been cited as the inspiration for the Cab Calloway classic \"Minnie the Moocher\"; her father was a mortician. Sam Cooke was her cousin. At 10, Douglas was a contestant and winner on the game show \"Name That Tune\" and says \"\"Ebony\" followed my career for the next three years.\"\n\nShe attended the Willard May School for professional children and afterwards the Quintanos High School for young professionals alongside Gregory Hines, Bernadette Peters, Carol Lynley, and Patty Duke. While in high school Douglas sang in a female trio named April May & June, who were signed as a management client by Little Anthony and the Imperials. She made a one-off recording in 1965 for RCA Victor, cutting the single \"I Don't Mind (Being Your Fool)\" under the name Carolyn Cooke: becoming pregnant with her first son at age 15 ended RCA's interest in promoting her. \n\nDouglas also cut several jingles for TV commercials – \"[I] used to do voiceovers for Ideal Toys and General Mills with Bernadette Peters\" – but recalls: \"I never thought I would be a singer,\" and for most of the 1960s Douglas pursued an acting career, appearing in an episode of \"The Patty Duke Show\" but mostly acting in theatrical productions beginning with \"One Tuesday Morning\" starring Clarice Taylor. Later Douglas understudied Jonelle Allen in the off-Broadway production of \"The Life of Mary McLeod Bethune\" and co-starred with James Earl Jones and Cicely Tyson in the play \"Moon on a Rainbow Shawl\".\n\nShe married \"high school sweetheart\" Ken Douglas in the mid-1960s and resumed her musical career in the early 1970s touring nationally on the oldies circuit in a lineup of the Chantels featuring original frontwoman Arlene Smith: with these Chantels, Douglas cut the single \"Some Tears Fall Dry\" for Capitol.\n\nIn 1974, Douglas was recruited by Midland International Records via an ad in \"Showbiz\" magazine: label vice president/record producer Eddie O'Loughlin had heard the UK hit single \"Doctor's Orders\" by Sunny and was seeking a female vocalist to cut the track for the U.S. market. Douglas's audition led to a five-year contract and her version of \"Doctor's Orders\" became a hit, reaching #2 on \"the Billboard\" disco chart, #9 R&B, and #11 on the Hot 100; the single also reached #4 in France.\n\nAlthough O'Loughlin was credited as \"Doctor's Orders\" producer the production had in fact been by Meco Monardo who was also responsible for Gloria Gaynor's \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" which had ascended the pop chart at around the same time as \"Doctor's Orders\"; claims have been made for each single to be the hit that broke disco into the Top 40. She made her album debut in 1975 with \"The Carol Douglas Album\", followed in 1976 by \"Midnight Love Affair\" and in 1977 by \"Full Bloom\". Monardo's special expertise was missing in the production of her post-\"Doctor's Orders\" tracks which maintained her as a popular club presence with negligible mainstream popularity; the follow-up single to \"Doctor's Orders\", \"A Hurricane is Coming Tonite\", became her only other Hot 100 entry peaking at #81 in April 1975. Douglas hit #1 on the disco chart with \"Midnight Love Affair\"; the song did appear on the Top 100 chart in \"Cash Box\" magazine but only via a cover by Tony Orlando and Dawn which reached #94. (In France, Douglas's version reached #82.) \n\nDouglas's other recordings included \"Headline News\" – a minor Edwin Starr hit from 1966 written by \"Doctor's Orders\" co-writer Roger Greenaway and remade by the latter track's originator Sunny – and in the tradition of \"Doctor's Orders\" Douglas cut discofied covers of several songs which were current or recent hits in the UK including ABBA's \"Dancing Queen\", \"I Wanna Stay With You\" by Gallagher and Lyle, and \"So You Win Again\" by Hot Chocolate. In 1977 she recorded the single \"You Make Me Feel The Music\" for the soundtrack to the film \"Haunted\".\n\n\"So You Win Again\" was arranged by Michael Zager whose presence on her 1978 album release \"Burnin\"' resulted in a critical (if not commercial) upswing. \"Burnin\" also featured Douglas's version of the Bee Gees' \"Night Fever\" – not a Zager arrangement – which became Douglas's only entry in the UK Singles Chart at #66.\n\nDouglas's 1979 album \"Come Into My Life\" was an obvious bid to recharge her club popularity; it was only six tracks long with production by Greg Carmichael who had enjoyed several disco hits with studio groups, but the single \"I Got The Answer\" was a mild club success. Although she did not appear in the disco-themed movie Saturday Night Fever, she was enough of a disco star that her name appears on the marquee of the disco featured in the movie.(You can hear a snippet of \"Midnight Love Affair\" playing when Tony and his friends are at the club).\n\nIn 1981, her cover of the Three Degrees' \"My Simple Heart\" was released on 20th Century Records as by then the Midland International (aka Midsong) was defunct. \"My Simple Heart\" was also her debut on Carrere Records based in Paris where she lived for a time: in the early 1980s Carrère handled her European releases while in the US she was signed to O'Loughlin's Next Plateau label. Her last album to date 'I Got Your Body', renamed 'Love Zone' in the US and Canada, was released in 1983 and included her last four 12\" singles from 1981 to 1983: \"My Simple Heart\", \"You're Not So Hot\", \"I Got Your Body\", and \"Got Ya Where I Want Ya\"; \"You're Not So Hot\" reached #71 in France (1982).\n\nThe retro-boom of the 1990s put Douglas back on the road touring and making personal appearances at a number of special events including the \"Martin Luther King Concert Series\", \"Beatstock '97\", \"Saturday Night Fever 20th Anniversary Reunion\", and the Dance Music Hall of Fame ceremony. In 2003, she returned to the recording studio when she was invited to sing backing vocals on Wanda Dee's \"Goddess Is Here!\" CD. During this period, she also re-recorded a number of her hits.\n\nDouglas is not to be confused with (and not related to) Carl Douglas, a fellow pop one-hit wonder whose famous #1 single, \"Kung Fu Fighting\", was in the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at about the same time as \"Doctor's Orders\".\n\nDouglas made an appearance on \"The People's Court\" (with Judge Marilyn Milian) in 2003 as the plaintiff in a case involving herself and fellow disco diva Sharon Brown. After the ruling, Brown stated that Douglas's decision to take her to court was a publicity stunt, to get some free TV air time. In addition to awarding Douglas some (not all) of the money she was requesting, Milian had Douglas sing a brief snippet of \"Doctor's Orders\", as well as having Brown sing a snippet of her 1982 song \"I Specialize in Love\".\n\n\n"}

It takes its name from the feast day of Saint Elisabeth of Hungary which was formerly November 19. \nIt ranks 20th in the list of worst floods in history.\nDuring the night of November 18 to November 19, 1421, a heavy storm near the North Sea coast caused the dikes to break in a number of places and the lower lying polder land was flooded. A number of villages were swallowed by the flood and were lost, causing between 2,000 and 10,000 casualties. The dike breaks and floods caused widespread devastation in Zeeland and Holland.\n\nThis flood separated the cities of Geertruidenberg and Dordrecht which had previously fought against each other during the Hook and Cod (civil) wars.\nMost of the land remains flooded even since that day.\n\nMost of the area remained flooded for several decades. Reclaimed parts are the island of Dordrecht, the Hoeksche Waard island, and north-western North Brabant (around Geertruidenberg). Most of the Biesbosch (a big area of nature in the Netherlands) area has been flooded since.\n\nThe cause of the flood was a heavy northern storm, a tidal surge, northerly winds and low pressure. Water from the storm in the North Sea surged up the rivers causing the dikes to overflow and break through. The flood reached a large sea arm between south-Holland and Zeeland or Zealand, destroying the Grote Hollandse Waard. At the lower point where the flood water reached the city of Dordrecht is the point where flood water still remains today.\n\n\n\n \n"}

Population: \n\nThe history of Nizhny Tagil begins with the opening of the Vysokogorsky iron ore quarry in 1696. The deposits were particularly rich, and included lodes of pure magnetic iron. The surrounding landscape provided everything needed for a successful and productive mining and smelting operation — rivers for transport, forests for fuel, and suitable climate.\n\nOver the following decades, the city developed as one of the early centers of Russian industrialization, and it has been a major producer of cast iron and steel. The town of Nizhny Tagil is also known for its production of the famous soviet tank T-34-85. The T-34-85 made here has manufacturing changes like a triangle shape flat armour surface on the turret, and wheels with a type of spoke.\n\nThe first Russian steam locomotive was constructed there in 1833, and the father-and-son engineers who developed it, Yefim and Miron Cherepanovs (Черепанов), were in 1956 commemorated by an bronze statue (executed by sculptor A. S. Kondratyev and architect A. V. Sotnikov) which stands in the center of the Theatrical Square in the heart of downtown.\n\nAccording to some sources, the copper for the skin of the Statue of Liberty was mined and refined in Nizhny Tagil. However, research by Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, USA, suggests that the Visnes mine in Norway is the most likely source.\n\nIn the 1990s, police estimated that about 50% of adult males were in the Russian Mafia. Membership has declined since then.\n\nIn early 2007, a mass grave with 30 murdered girls and women was found near Nizhny Tagil. They had been abducted in the city by a prostitution gang between 2002 and 2006. See Nizhny Tagil mass murder (2002-2007). A fictionalized description of Nizhny Tagil and these murders appears in “The Bourne Sanction,” by Eric Van Lustbader, chapters 28, 30, 34 and 39.\n\nRivers and ponds take up one third of the city's territory. Nizhny Tagil spans from north to south and from east to west. The altitude of the city varies from . \n\nThe city is built around the extinct volcano Lisya Mountain. This mountain with a watchtower on its top is a symbol of the city. Another hill, , is located in the northern part of the city at an altitude of .\n\nNeighboring cities include Yekaterinburg to the south, Serov and Priobye in the north, Perm in the west, and Alapayevsk and Verkhnyaya Salda in the east.\n\nThe city features a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfc) with mildly warm summers and very cold winters. Precipitation is mostly concentrated between late spring and early fall, peaking in the months of July and August. A freeze has been recorded for every month of the year.\n\nWithin the framework of the administrative divisions, Nizhny Tagil serves as the administrative center of Prigorodny District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with twenty-three rural localities, incorporated separately as the City of Nizhny Tagil—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Nizhny Tagil is incorporated as Nizhny Tagil Urban Okrug.\n\nThe city is divided into three city districts: Leninsky, encompassing the city center and Nizhnetagilsky Pond; Tagilstroyevsky, a comparatively small section at the north part of town; and Dzerzhinsky, a sizable section to the east of the city center principally consisting of apartment buildings and other residences.\n\nFormer mayors:\n\n\nIn 2015, a large portion of the land within the bounds of the city is dominated by the facilities of the factories located in this industrial city.\n\nNizhny Tagil is an industrial center of the Middle Urals. Highly power-intensive industries such as ferrous metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, and metal working are well-developed in the city. A total of 606 manufacturing companies operate in Nizhny Tagil.\n\nNizhny Tagil Iron and Steel Plant (\"Nizhnetagilsky Metallurgichesky Kombinat\", \"NTMK\") is a leading Russian steel company.\n\n\"Uralvagonzavod\" (\"UVZ\") is the main producer of modern tanks on the territory of the former Soviet Union and Russia. It is the largest main battle tank manufacturer in the world. The T-72, T-90, and T-14 are produced in the city. As of 2016 an economic slowdown in Russia had resulted in diminished demand for civilian products such as train cars, but strong demand continued for tanks.\n\nThere are resources to manufacture medical tools for traumatology at the Nizhny Tagil medical tools plant.\n\nNizhny Tagil is one of centers of exhibition activity in the Middle Urals. Nizhny Tagil Institute of Metals Testing was the host of the international exhibitions such as Ural Expo Arms / Russian Expo Arms, Russian Defense Expo (2001 and 2002).\n\nThe 42nd Rocket Division of Strategic Rocket Forces is based here, equipped with 36 Topol nuclear missiles.\n\nThere are eight prisons in the city. A number of these are \"colonies\", which means they are obliged to contribute to supporting themselves through unpaid work. One prison is for police only, another for women, another is a colony, IK-5. Some prisoners help manufacture tanks, which reduces the cost of the tank substantially.\n\nNizhny Tagil is known for its decorative trays.\n\nDemidovs' initiatives in the area of culture had a favorable influence on the development of Tagil community into the Urals' most important cultural center. In the 19th century, a library and the museum of natural history and antiquity were opened.\n\nThe city has a network of 28 libraries servicing 75,000 readers every year.\n\nTagil museums include the old regional history museum, the museum of Fine Arts, and a number of new museums opened in the 1990s: the museum of tray painting art, the museum of lifestyle and handicrafts representing the starting point of a new ethnographic complex.\n\nThe Demidov Park, a new cultural and historical project, is planned to be built in the city.\n\nNizhny Tagil has been chosen to host international Urals' Industrial Heritage conferences and workshops.\n\nCity theatrical life is represented by three professional theaters: the National D. N. Mamin-Sibiryak Academic Drama Theater, a puppet theater, community theaters, and the actor department of Nizhny Tagil College of Arts, which has been training actors and actresses for Nizhny Tagil and oblast scenes for two years.\nSeveral Maximum-security prisons surround the town, and most town residents have close connections to them. When prisoners are released from the prisons, they are not given their train fare, and most remain in the town.\n\nThe oldest university is Nizhny Tagil State Socio-Educational Academy. The state educational academy operates 4 institutes, 13 faculties and 29 departments. There is post-graduate work in three fields: general education, the history of pedagogy and education, Russian history, the Russian language. In art and graphics department 2008 year launched five workshops in which students engage in decorative art. The Academy has four modern sports halls. In summer, a wall is erected for climbing. There is a gymnasium and fitness room.\n\nThe Nizhny Tagil Technological Institute is located south-east of the city center.\n\nThe city formerly had an association football team, FC Uralets Nizhny Tagil, which played in the Russian Second Division and was dissolved in 2006.\n\nThe city ice hockey team is Sputnik Nizhny Tagil, which played in the Russian Major League. \n\nThe bandy club Metallurg Nizhny Tagil plays in the 2nd highest division.\n\nNizhny Tagil was also a host of several competitions in ski jumping World Cup.\n\nMedical care is provided in 29 medical care centers that employ 1,100 doctors and 4,500 assistants. Annually, up to 100,000 people are hospitalized, 28,000 surgeries are performed, and up to four million appointments are registered in the city medical care centers.\n\nThere is a Yekaterinburg branch of eye microsurgery in Nizhny Tagil. There is obstetrical care. There is a network of municipal and private pharmacies. \n\nIn 2015, pollution from factories was annually. Respiratory rate of infection in children was 50% higher than the rest of the country. The city had the highest rate of stomach and lung cancer in the country.\n\nRail lines and highways connect the city to the rest of the country.\n\nThe city is served by the Salka Airport, located northeast of the city. It was a military base until 1994. Then it became a civil airport.\n\n<!---blue-links further need citation to ties them to city per & \n"}

He went on scientific collecting trips with Alpheus Hyatt and Nathaniel Shaler in the summer of 1860 to Trenton Point, Maine and Mount Desert Island and in the summer of 1861 to Anticosti Island and Labrador. In 1864 Verrill made reports on mining, or prospective mining, properties in New Hampshire, New York, and Pennsylvania. Two years after graduation from Harvard, he accepted a position as Yale University's Sheffield Scientific School first Professor of Zoology, and taught there from 1864 until his retirement in 1907.\n\nIn 1861 while under the guidance of Louis Agassiz at Harvard he was sent to Washington D.C. to obtain specimens from the Smithsonian institution and promote friendly relations and interest between the scientific men of Washington and those of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology . Under the direction of Professor Spencer Fullerton Baird, Verrill spent almost three months working on the coral collections of the Smithsonian. The process of overhauling the collection required identifying various species, selecting type specimens and making up a set of duplicates to be sent back north to Harvard . While in Washington he became acquainted and formed lifelong friendships with a number of both distinguished and up and coming scientists . The friendship that Verrill and Professor Baird developed, lead to the appointment of Verrill as assistant to the Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries in 1871 . In this role, which he held till 1887, Verrill was responsible for marine investigations and all invertebrate collections . The estimated several hundred thousand specimens collected between 1871 and 1887 were sent to New Haven for Verrill to sort, identify, catalogue and label . As partial compensation for his work, after the first set of type specimens was sent to the Smithsonian, he was allowed to keep the first set of duplicates as personal property. Upon retirement he sold this personal collection to the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History, where they now form part of the Invertebrate Zoology collection . \n\nBetween 1868–70 he was professor of comparative anatomy and entomology in the University of Wisconsin. From 1860 Verrill investigated the invertebrate fauna of the Atlantic coast, with special reference to the corals, annelids, echinoderms, and mollusks, and became the chief authority on the living cephalopods, especially the giant squid of the North Atlantic.\n\nHis \"Report upon the Invertebrate Animals of Vineyard Sound\" (1874), with Sidney Irving Smith, whose sister he married, is a standard manual of the marine zoology of southern New England.\n\nIn later life he explored with his students the geology and marine animals of the Bermuda Islands. Besides many memoirs and articles on the subjects mentioned above, he published \"The Bermuda Islands\" (1903; second edition, 1907).\n\nVerrill published more than 350 papers and monographs, and described more than 1,000 species of animals in virtually every major taxonomy group. He was a member of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nIn 1959, Yale's Peabody Museum established the Addison Emery Verrill Medal, awarded for achievement in the natural sciences.\n\nHis son, Alpheus Hyatt Verrill, known as Hyatt Verrill, (1871–1954) was an American archaeologist, explorer, inventor, illustrator and author.\n\n\n"}

That song, along with \"We Got Our Own Thing\" (later sampled by Heavy D and the Boyz) and \"Sure Can't Go to the Moon,\" hit #1 for five weeks on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.\n\nThey released two full-length LPs, \"Devil's Gun\" (1977) and \"Deadeye Dick\" (1978) both for Westbound Records.\nIn 1998 a compilation CD was released with full length selected tracks from both LPs.\n\n\"Devil's Gun\" was the first record played at the opening of Studio 54 by DJ Richie Kaczor.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2173735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173735", "title": "International DN", "text": "International DN\n\nThe International DN is a class of iceboat. The name stands for Detroit News, where the first iceboat of this type was designed and built in the winter of 1936–1937. Archie Arrol was a master craftsman working in the Detroit News hobby shop, and together with iceboaters Joe Lodge and Norman Jarrait designed a racing boat they called the \"Blue Streak 60\", later to become known as the \"DN 60\". In 1937 a group of 50 laymen worked with Archie in the hobby shop to produce the first fleet of the new iceboats. These first boats broke during the initial season, and after Jarrait and Lodge modified the design to increase the strength, the group got back together to build a second set of iceboats in 1938.\n\nThis design, featuring a narrow, single-person cockpit, three steel blades in tricycle style arrangement and a steeply raked mast, remains to this day the most popular iceboat design in use.\n\nThe DN is 12 feet (3.7 m) long, with a 21 inch (53 cm) wide cockpit and an 8-foot (2.4 m) wide runner plank. The 16 foot (4.9 m) mast supports 60 square feet (5.6 m²) of sail area. The front runner is typically rigged with a steering rod that connects the runner to a tiller that is mounted just aft of the mast base. The boat weighs around 100 lb (45 kg), and is piloted by a single helmeted sailor.\n\nThe class has a devout following. The International DN Ice Yacht Racing Association (IDNIYRA) is the governing body for the class. It publishes standards for boat design and allows enthusiasts to assemble for races and to share good ice locations. The DN is raced extensively in the northern United States, Canada, and throughout Northern Europe, with World Championships alternating between North American and Europe each year. In addition to the World Championship, the North American and European Championships count towards a racer's World Ranking.\n\nOne of the reasons that the DN iceboat class has become so popular over the years has been largely in part to how transportable and fast they truly are. With a steady 10–12 mile per hour wind and good ice conditions, the DN, when piloted properly, can reach speeds in excess of 50 miles per hour. And with just a 12–15 mile per hour steady wind, the DN iceboat can reach a readily attainable 55–65 miles per hour.\n\n"}
{"id": "2173736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173736", "title": "Mega Man Battle Network 2", "text": "Mega Man Battle Network 2\n\nMega Man Battle Network 2 is a video game developed by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld game console. It is the second game of the \"Mega Man Battle Network\" series. It was released in 2001 in Japan and 2002 in America and Europe. The story of the game starts after the events of \"Mega Man Network Transmission\". It was released on the Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan on November 12, 2014 and in North America on January 8, 2015.\n\nThe general gameplay is essentially identical to that of the original Mega Man Battle Network game; indeed, the two games utilize a significant amount of the same graphics. However, Battle Network 2 introduces several new concepts that augment the original game-system.\n\nIn terms of health, Mega Man no longer heals fully and automatically after each battle. Furthermore, the game introduces the SubChip, a device similar in basic concept to a battle chip but one that can only be activated outside of battle.\n\nWhere in the original, a player had only one chip folder, Battle Network 2 introduces the possibility of alternate active folders, allowing players to easily customize their range of possible attacks to conform to multiple situations. Notably, chips used in one active folder are not available for the construction of a second, even though only one folder may be used at any given time. Up to three folders can be found in this game, and all are fully customizable. As in the previous game, folders may have up to five Navi chips each and only five of the same kind of any chip (the first game allowed up to ten of the same non-Navi chip).\n\nAside from the addition of new Battle Chips in general, Battle Network 2 expanded the old chip code system, which had previously been limited only to the alphabet. Some Chips could occur with an asterisk (*) as their code letter, a wild card symbol meaning the Chip can be used with any other Chip. This game is the only Battle Network game (besides 6) where it is possible (from one chip trader only) to get * coded Navi chips. There are now 250 chips possible in single player mode, with chips 251-260 possible only via NetBattling, and chip #261 (Sanctuary) earned when the player completes Hard Mode. Players can also now earn up to five stars on the title screen by completing major tasks in the game.\n\nAdditionally, players may access NetSquares in the game. These places serve as a sort of Town Square for NetNavis and their operators to relax, buy supplies, and exchange information.\n\nOne final change was the replacement of the old armor system, which only affected damage received, with a style system that affects damage received, attack damage, physical appearance, among other benefits. During the course of the game MegaMan may take on one of five Styles (Guts, Team, Custom, Shield, and Hub), each of which will also be aligned with one of four elements (Heat, Wood, Elec, and Aqua). He can store up to two styles in his memory at once and change out when not battling.\n\nStarting with Battle Network 2, anytime a chip trader is used, the game will automatically save when the player receives their new chip. This is to prevent the player from cheating by simply soft resetting without saving until the chip trader gives out a desirable chip, which was possible in the first game. Another chip trader tradition that starts with this game and continues on for the remainder of the series is that there is one ten chip trader that will appear only upon completing Story Mode (yellow star), and gives out the best chips of all the chip traders.\n\nThree months following the events of Mega Man Battle Network (two following Network Transmission; both game facts), the story opens with the world in a time of peace following the defeat of the organization known as the WWW. However, \"NetCrime\", as perpetrated by a \"NetMafia\" organization known as \"Gospel\", is on the rise. Once again Lan Hikari (known as Netto Hikari in the Japanese version) and his NetNavi MegaMan become involved and work to defeat Gospel's plot to destroy society.\n\nNetNavis Operators are given the chance to become City NetBattlers, a lesser form of an Official NetBattler, which Lan does, allowing him to travel around the world, both in cyberspace and in real life. In doing so, Lan befuddles Gospel's attempts to collect four particularly powerful computer programs, called simply SuperPrograms, on numerous occasions. However, Gospel is finally successful and uses these programs, in combination with computer bugs, to construct a \"SuperNavi\" of immense power. This Navi is a duplication of Bass, who appeared in the original game as a hidden boss and who plays a larger role in later games. However, after fighting Megaman the Bass copy destabilized and transformed into a gigantic, wolf-shaped super Multi-bug Organism (Also referred as Gospel) that heavily resembles the sixth game's Gregar. The energy needed to create this Navi causes unusual radiation, blending the Net and the real world together. This radiation eventually paralyzes Lan, effectively making him incapable of operating MegaMan, however the latter puts the two into full synchronization so that Lan may control MegaMan by thought and emotion, similar in concept to the final confrontation of the original game.\n\nDuring the final battle it is revealed that the leader of Gospel is Sean Obihiro, a child who felt neglected by and resentful of society after his parents died in a plane crash. After defeating the Multi-bug Organism Gospel, Lan promises to be the boy's friend after he has paid for his crimes. After the credits, Bass is seen destroying copies of himself, and shows anger toward the human that made them (implying to Sean). He swears he'll exact his revenge on the humans and then disappears.\n\n\"Mega Man Battle Network 2\" sold 124,349 units in Japan during 2001 and has been listed by Dengeki Online as the 91st best-selling video game in the region for that year. \"Famitsu\" sales data showed that the game was the 30th best-selling game of 2002 with a total of 344,230 units sold by the end of year. The magazine showed a total of 446,938 units sold in the country at that point.\n"}
{"id": "2173737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173737", "title": "Shōshinkai", "text": "Shōshinkai\n\n', full name ', is a Japanese Nichiren Buddhist dissenting group formed in July 1980 by approximately 200 Nichiren Shōshū priests who were mostly the disciples of the former High Priest Nittatsu Hosoi, along with their lay followers who were critical of the Soka Gakkai.\n\nThe association is known for rejection of the legitimacy of successorship of 67th High Priest Nikken Abe. Nikken Abe expelled the association in 1980, citing further defiance while demoting those who have returned to Nichiren Shoshu to a loss of priestly capacities and loss of senior roles as probationary punishment. Most of these priests have either aged and deceased, reverting back their temple property with new younger Nichiren Shoshu priests taking over the administration to the Head Temple Taisekiji while others have accordingly joined other Nichiren sects until their retirement. \n\nDuring the 1970s, the Sōka Gakkai undertook a number of activities and propagated several notions that many in the Nichiren Shōshū priesthood and laity saw as deviations from traditional Nichiren Shōshū doctrine. Ultimately, the sentiment within the priesthood and traditional lay organizations grew so strong that a split became imminent, and, at a special leaders meeting held at Nichiren Shōshū Head Temple Taiseki-ji on 7 November 1978, termed the \"Tozan of Apology\", the senior leadership of Sōka Gakkai apologized to the priesthood and promised to correct the incompatibilities and never deviate from Nichiren Shōshū doctrine again. This apology was later printed in both the \"Seikyo Shimbun\" SGI magazine (November edition) as well as the manuscript of the \"Dai-Nichiren\" December 1978 publication.\n\nOn 24 April 1979, Sōka Gakkai's President Daisaku Ikeda stepped down to take responsibility for the incident. In addition, at the 40th General Meeting of the Sōka Gakkai on 3 May 1979, the 66th High Priest Nittatsu Hosoi declared his decision to accept the organization's apology and forgive the matter on the explicit condition that Sōka Gakkai observe its solemn promise to uphold Nichiren Shōshū doctrine. Nittatsu also instructed his own priests to stop open criticism of Sōka Gakkai and to cease encouraging Sōka Gakkai members to affiliate themselves directly with the temples, which had previously exacerbated the contested issue.\n\nOn 22 July 1979, Nittatsu died of chronic heart disease without directly naming his successor. Shinno Abe, at that time a young priest, insisted that he was secretly given permission to be the next High Priest by Nittatsu before he had died and succeeded him as the 67th High Priest, Nikken Abe. He changed his predecessor's policy and gave Sōka Gakkai a chance to cooperate with him. But the priests (who were mainly the disciples of the former High Priest) who later formed the Shōshinkai disagreed, claiming Sōka Gakkai had only taken its deviations underground.\n\nThe same group of dissenting priests continued their campaign of criticism and formed Shōshinkai to organize their efforts into a movement. Despite repeated admonitions from the new High Priest Nikken and Nichiren Shōshū leadership to cease and desist, Shōshinkai went ahead with a major rally on 24 August 1980. Due to this dissension, Nikken and the senior Nichiren Shōshū leadership punished a number of priests for their involvement, including five excommunications. The Shōshinkai priests involved with the excommunication responded that such act was ineffective because the punishment was done by an illegitimate High Priest.\n\nOn 13 December 1980, the priests of the Shōshinkai sent a document to Nikken casting doubt on the legitimacy of his office. They then filed suit with a local government court on 21 January 1981 seeking to annul Nikken's appointment on the grounds that he had never been named successor by Nittatsu. Nikken demanded that the Shōshinkai priests retract their accusations or face excommunication. Some two hundred priests refused. Upon the publicized notice of excommunication, a number of them filed a lawsuit seeking reinstatement, but the local court ruled that all religious claims, including the petition for annulment of Nikken's status were internal Nichiren Shoshu matters to be resolved within the sect itself.\n\nThe Shōshinkai continued its anti-Sōka Gakkai and anti-High Priest Nikken activities, even accepting new acolytes into the priesthood and conferring initiation ceremonies for new believers. Most Shōshinkai priests continued living within their Nichiren Shōshū temples, which they were technically allowed to do until their death. \n\nThe Head Temple Taisekiji has declared that these temple properties have since reverted to Nichiren Shōshū as their occupants have died or been ordered by the courts to vacate. While many have deceased or abandoned their priesthood, only a few Shōshinkai priests have reverted to Nichiren Shōshū, and even so they were deprived of their \"kesa\" and \"Koromo\" Robe and had to start as complete beginners (\"kozo\") as part of their punishment. Accordingly, their temples remained under Nichiren Shoshu as the priests have aged and new younger priests affiliated with the Head Temple Taisekiji take on the role of the temple property administration. \n\nAccordingly, several Shōshinkai priests from the 1980s have also gone to other varying Nichiren sects as they age, among them in particular is the Nichiren Shū sect at Kuon-ji in Yamanashi Prefecture. There, they haven also opened a research center called \"Kofu Danjo\" (興風談所) that has spawned books that have attracted attention from other Nichiren Buddhist organizations for their scholarly content. \n\n\n"}

It is the third game in the \"Mega Man Battle Network\" series, released in 2002 in Japan and 2003 in North America. While in North America and Europe, two complementary versions of the game - Blue and White - exist, marketed simultaneously, this was not the case in Japan. The game was first released in a single version in this region, although later a version containing bug fixes, new areas, optional bosses, and other improvements was released some months after the original. It was released on the Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan on December 17, 2014 and in North America on May 14, 2015.\n\nThe year is 200X. Doctor Wily has reformed the evil organization WWW and now seeks to release Alpha, an evil prototype version of the Internet that was locked away before the current Internet was set up. To release him, Wily needs the passwords, referred to in-game as TetraCodes, to the firewalls Alpha is trapped behind, which are hidden in secret locations.\n\nA tournament called the N1 Grand Prix is being held, supposedly to determine who is the best NetBattler. It is later revealed to be part of the plan for Wily to steal the TetraCodes, and the WWW attacks between rounds.\n\nLan Hikari and his NetNavi, Mega Man, have to fight NetNavis sent by Wily and attempt to defend the TetraCodes from Wily, but he manages to retrieve them anyway with the help of Bass, and uses them to release Alpha. Lan and Megaman confront Wily immediately after he releases Alpha, and battles Bass. After Bass is deleted, Alpha consumes Dr. Wily and proceeds to infect the whole of the Internet with his coding.\n\nMegaman battles Alpha, and is able to defeat him. As Alpha begins to delete, the network in the area begins to crash as Alpha attempts to absorb everything to save itself. Unfortunately, this includes Megaman and Lan. In an attempt to allow Lan to escape, Megaman overloads, sacrificing his life to save Lan. Later, Lan's father manages to recover Megaman during a salvage operation of the affected network location, and is able to revive him.\n\nThe gameplay in \"Battle Network 3\" is similar to that of its predecessors, with few graphical enhancements and minor gameplay changes. Battle Network 3 saw the removal of Power-Ups that were collected to improve the MegaBuster - instead the Navi Customizer was added, allowing abilities to be added on with certain rules as to how these abilities can be added with respect to each other.\n\nEach version of the game has a separate Contest Navi: BowlMan for \"Blue\"/\"Black\", and MistMan for \"White\". \"Blue\" also includes another Navi, Punk, that could be challenged from time to time. Punk's chip was only available as part of a special promotion in Japan. However, it can be attained via a cheat device or by being traded from Black to Blue. White, on the other hand, has no such Navi.\n\nIn \"Battle Network 3\" the virus breeder is available, where special, friendly viruses (that must be found first somewhere in the net) are kept and can be fed using BugFrags. When a virus is found and put in the breeder, a chip for that virus is obtained. Feeding each virus BugFrags levels up their chip accordingly. After a family of a certain type of virus has been fed to the max, they will release information to the player as to where the Omega Virus of that family (i.e. For the KillerEye family, they will give you a clue to find KillerEye Omega) can be found. After the Omega Virus of that family is found and deleted, it will join the others in the Virus Breeder and will be available when the corresponding Virus Chip is used. This is the only Battle Network game that features non-Navi Omega viruses.\n\n\"Battle Network 3\" introduces further classification of Battle Chips by splitting them into three categories: 200 white Standard chips, 85 blue Mega chips and 25 pink Giga chips. Standard Chips are limited to only four of each kind (even if letter codes are different) per folder. Mega Chips are limited to only five per folder, and only one of each kind. Only one Giga Chip is allowed per folder and only one copy of each Giga chip exists throughout the entire game. These specifications would continue for the remainder of the series. There are certain types of programs (see Navi Customizer) that can boost the Mega and Giga chip limits, though. There are five unique Giga chips exclusive to each version and this would continue for the remainder of the series, although Battle Network 5 offers six Giga chips per version. There are also Program advances which are a combination of three or four chips.\n\nMultiplayer is accessible from the \"Comm\" option on the Main Menu. Multiplayer, also called \"Netbattling\", allows two players to fight head to head with their respective Megaman.EXEs (this includes style-changes and health, as well as Navi customizer stats). When you enter the Multiplayer screen, the player can choose from Netbattling, Trading Chips, and Comparing Libraries.\n\nBy choosing the Netbattling option from the Comm menu, a player is given two options again, Practice and Real. Practice allows two players to battle with no risk of losing chips, and does not count against your Win/Loss record. In Real, matches count for win-loss records and the losing player in a Netbattle forfeits a chip randomly chosen from their chip pack. There is a special Giga-Chip that is attained in this fashion (DeltaRayEdge Z for Blue, Balance Y for White), which has a 1/32 chance of happening instead of the winning player acquiring the other player's chip. For these chips to be attained, both players MUST have at least one star and you must be battling in midweight or heavyweight, real. After choosing Practice/Real, players can choose Lightweight, Midweight, and Heavyweight. Lightweight allows players to battle on a level field, with no negative panels on either side. Midweight may give certain obstacles on either player's side of the field, such as Rockcubes and plain Rocks. Panels may also be cracked or broken. Heavyweight is guaranteed to have negative panels on both sides, and some matches contain rapidly replenishing Guardians, which deal 200 damage (400 on ice or to aqua style, 800 to an aqua style on ice) to a player who hits them.\n\nPlayers can also trade Battle Chips with other players. No Giga Chip can be traded. Trading is required to attain all seven stars in the game, due to the lack of Mistman in blue version and Bowlman in white version. The \"Comparing Libraries\" option scans both players' libraries. If one player has a Battle Chip that the other player does not, the other player shall attain a blank spot in the library that represents that chip. From here, the player can buy that Chip from Higsby's shop in ACDC Town after the defeat of Beastman; using the Order System. Giga Chips cannot be bought from Higsby's Shop.\n\n\"Mega Man Battle Network 3\" performed well commercially in Japan. The original version, released on December 6, 2002, was the second best-selling video game in the region during its release week at 91,351 units according to \"Famitsu\". The game appeared within the \"Famitsu\" top 30 best-sellers list for twelve weeks following its release with 461,426 units sold by March 16, 2003. The game's updated \"Black\" version, released in Japan on March 28, 2003, was the 11th best-selling video game in the region during its release week at 28,708 units sold. It also appeared the \"Famitsu\" top 30 best-sellers list for the four following weeks with sales of 73,964 units by April 27, 2003. By the end of 2003, the original version had sold 500,001 units and the \"Black\" version had sold 168,946 units in Japan alone.\n\n"}

{"id": "2173746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173746", "title": "Mega Man Battle Network 4", "text": "Mega Man Battle Network 4\n\nMega Man Battle Network 4 is a video game developed by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld game console. It is the fourth game in the \"Mega Man Battle Network\" series. Like \"Battle Network 3\" before it, \"Battle Network 4\" has two different versions, Red Sun and Blue Moon, that differ in story and gameplay details. \"Battle Network 4\" is compatible with the e-Reader, and can be linked up with \"Rockman EXE 4.5 Real Operation\" and the Battle Chip Gate for NetBattles. It is able to link with \"Mega Man Zero 3\", and contains references to Konami's \"Boktai\" series.\n\nThe beginning of the game shows the player at a space research center known in-game as \"NAXA.\" Scientists have discovered a massive asteroid speeding toward the earth that, if made contact with, would end all life on earth. \n\nThe game then cuts to the protagonists, Lan Hikari and MegaMan.EXE (in this continuity a Network Navigator or NetNavi, an in-universe AI program), going shopping with their father. While in the electronics district, they find themselves pitted against a NetNavi known as ShadeMan, portrayed as having strong dark powers. Upon defeating ShadeMan, he disappears, dropping unknown data. It is revealed to Lan and MegaMan to be a \"DarkChip,\" a program described as unleashing great power at the cost of the Navi's soul (their goodness and well-being). The duo are warned to never use it under any circumstances.\n\nThe game cuts back to the scientists, who are now joined by some of the best scientists and researchers of various countries, including the duo's father. They come to the conclusion that the best way to avoid impact with the asteroid is to use a laser to move it off-course.\n\nThe game again changes to the perspective of the protagonists. The next in-game day, after the ShadeMan incident, Lan and MegaMan participate in the Den Battle Tournament, the local NetBattle tournament, and become the champions. After completing the tourney, they return home to find it burglarized by someone connected to the DarkChip. Upon investigation, they discover that the \"DarkChip Syndicate Nebula\" was behind the attack of their home, looking for the DarkChip the two possess. After defeating a Nebula member in battle, he warns the duo that the syndicate has their eye on them and the DarkChip.\n\nWith no leads to go on, the pair decide to go to the amusement park, only to find the animatronics going haywire. Lan and MegaMan find ShadeMan in one of the animatronic animals. In order to best ShadeMan, MegaMan has no other option but to use the DarkChip. \n\nNow, without the DarkChip or ShadeMan, the duo decide to enter the Eagle/Hawk Tournament held by the amusement park. The team emerge victorious once again. After the tournament, they meet LaserMan, the leader Navi of Nebula, who shows MegaMan the DarkSoul lurking within him now that he has used a DarkChip.\n\nMeanwhile, the scientists fire the laser at the asteroid, but it fails. One of the scientists, Dr. Regal, claims to have an idea and asks for a world-class Net Operator and Navi.\n\nNaturally, Lan and MegaMan are invited to the Red Sun/Blue Moon Tournament, a competition explained as putting together the best of the best of NetBattlers. After winning the tourney, the duo are taken to NAXA and are briefed on the situation. It is explained that the asteroid has a computer in it and can be steered away from the planet. Before Lan has the chance to send MegaMan to the asteroid, Dr. Regal reveals himself as the leader of Nebula and had been planning all along to use the asteroid in his plan for world domination. Still, Lan is able to send MegaMan, where he once again meets LaserMan, as well as Duo, the Operating System of the asteroid. MegaMan defeats both of them and convinces Duo that the planet is worthy enough to not be destroyed. The asteroid leaves, and Regal appeared to have committed suicide in order to avoid legal prosecution, but was revealed to be alive in the sequel. Once again, Lan and MegaMan have saved the world from the latest crisis.\n\n\"Battle Network 4\" greatly differs from \"Battle Network 3\" in many ways, the most notable of which is the concept of \"DoubleSoul\" (\"Soul Unison\" in the original). DoubleSoul is similar to how the classic-style Mega Man could acquire the weapons of the Robot Masters that he has defeated: by using DoubleSoul, Mega Man.EXE could use the powers of other NetNavis in the same manner as how classic Mega Man could use the powers of the Robot Masters through their weapons. To perform a DoubleSoul, which lasts for a temporary amount of time (three turns), however, a chip must be sacrificed for the battle.\n\nAnother key feature is that it takes a \"minimum\" of three playthroughs of the game's main story mode in order to uncover all of its secrets - although many criticize the game for the same reason. After each playthrough, a player is permitted to either continue with their existing game or to start a new game at a higher level of difficulty, although any save at a higher level of difficulty will overwrite a save of the lower level. Thus, it is very important for those players who want to collect all chips and power-ups to be sure that all blue/purple mystery datas and all V1 virus' chips and program advances have been collected before starting Level 2. The same is true for going on to Level 3.\n\nFinally, DarkChips, which are powerful chips resulting in a host of negative side-effects, make their debut in this game: a mood indicator in the corner of the screen shows the mood of MegaMan, and should the mood change to a negative one, random DarkChips will appear in Mega Man's Custom Screen. Each DarkChip will have many negative (and notable permanent) side-effects, that taint MegaMan's own soul with darkness. Should the darkness overwhelm MegaMan, he will find a different selection of chips are made available to use, with a different selection of Program Advances (like the infamous \"DarkNeo\" Program Advance, which involves the Bass GigaChip) therein. Also, when you use a DarkChip (aside from the battle with Shade Man in the ToyRobo and in free tournaments at Higsby's shop), Mega Man permanently loses 1 HP for each and cannot regain all HP lost, even if you were to purify yourself. There are also special chips (like the 5 evil chips) that can only be used if Mega Man is completely consumed by dark power. Conversely, if Mega Man does enough battles (about 1000) without ever using a Dark Chip, he will turn brighter in color and allow him to more easily achieve Full Synchro mode.\n\nThe Emotion Window is a mood indicator that lets the operator know Mega Man's current state based on fighting performance. The window also changes whenever DoubleSoul is used, to a mugshot of the corresponding Soul used.\n\n\"Full Synchro\" is a heightened state of focus gained by performing a counter-attack against a virus (I.e. attacking the virus just before it attacks). In this state, Battlechip attacks are doubled in strength. It is possible to consecutively achieve Full Synchro by continuously counter-attacking and thus doubling effectiveness in battle. Full Synchro expires when the player fails to counter-attack a virus, or when MegaMan suffers damage.\n\nConversely, when a fight is not playing in Mega Man's favor, unless in a doublesoul, he gains an anxious expression and following this, Darkchips begin to display themselves in the Custom Screen. Also during this emotional state, DoubleSoul transformations are disabled. The player can return to a normal, calm state by successfully counter-attacking a virus, restoring HP, scoring hits on the enemy, or winning the battle.\n\nIf, during battle, Mega Man suffers repeated hits at a rapid rate, or if he is stunned for a period of time, he goes into a state of rage which is similar to Full Synchro in the way that it doubles Battlechip attack power, but instead of a focused expression in the emotion window, Mega Man has an angry expression and in the battle screen he glows orange. As such, it can be considered a desperation state which gives the player a chance to turn the battle towards their favor. Rage will expire when the player attacks and damages a virus, or if the player successfully counter-attacks, at which point the player will instead go into Full Synchro. It also expires after a while if no chip is used. Unlike Full Synchro, if Mega Man is hit while in rage, he will not revert to his normal emotion. During \"Full Synchro\" and \"Rage\" Mega Man's attacks double, giving him an extra advantage.\n\nThe Emotion Window is a feature that has lived on in the Battle Network 5 and 6 games. The basic functions of the Emotion Window stated above (Full Synchro, Anxiety, and Rage) have not changed since, though the anxiety emotion has been removed in Battle Network 6, replaced with Tired and Very Tired status.\n\n\"Battle Network 4\" brings out many new chips, with standard chips weighing in with 150 unique attacks. Mega Chips fell in number from the previous game, only having 60 different chips. Instead of V1, V2, V3, V4, and V5 chips (previously found in Battle Network 1 and 2 with V4 and V5 chips found only in 3) are now \"(Navi)\", \"(Navi)\"SP, \"(Navi)\"DS. Five version-exclusive Giga Chips appear in each version. There are 56 new kinds of chips, called, Secret Chips. Most of these are obtained by winning Higsby's \"Free Tournaments\", though there are a few exceptions. For example, the player may obtain the \"Z-Saber\" chip by linking their game with a copy of \"Mega Man Zero 3\". There are eight DarkChips in this game with bad effects to your Navi's soul and emotions. (See above section for information on DarkChips.)\n\nIn the previous two games, players earned different colored stars on the title screen for completing certain tasks. Battle Network 4 replaces these with badges (sometimes called icons or marks instead) on the top of the title screen, and continues these for the remainder of the series. Battle Network 4 includes seven icons, one for defeating the final boss Duo, one for getting all Soul Unisons, one for collecting all Standard-level battlechips, one for all Mega-level chips, one for all Giga-level chips, one for completing all Program Advances, and the last for defeating Bass (Forte in Japanese) in his Omega form.\n\nLinking any edition of Mega Man Battle Network 4 with the Battle Chip Gate expansion for Game Boy Advance (Sold in Japan only) would allow you to play as a Navi, depending on what Navi chip you owned. Instead of selecting chips like in normal gameplay, the custom gauge at the top would fill up and change to four different colors as it filled up, white, yellow, and blue, and red. when the bar is yellow, you can use a regular chip. When it is blue, you can use a mega chip, and at red you can use a giga chip. shooting fills the gauge up faster.\n\nThis game is known to become unplayable on original Nintendo DS systems. If the player leaves, and then returns to, the map while in Park Area during WoodMan's scenario, the game will hang indefinitely. This incompatibility was officially acknowledged by Nintendo. It does not occur on any other Nintendo DS family system or on any Game Boy Advance family systems.\n\nCapcom of Japan gathered together their surplus of Rock Man EXE 4: Tournament Red Sun and Rock Man EXE 4: Tournament Blue Moon games and put them in a special edition box that was released in Japan only on December 31, 2004 along with a special E-Card for the E-Reader.\n\nThe two versions of \"Mega Man Battle Network 4\" entered Japanese sales charts as the second and fourth best-selling games of their release week and continued to appear on the top 10 best-sellers list for the following six weeks. The game sold 535,836 copies combined by the end of 2003 and an additional 393,014 copies by the end of 2004. \"Mega Man Battle Network 4\" has sold 1.35 million copies worldwide as of December 31, 2008, becoming the best-selling game in the \"Battle Network\" series.\n"}

It is a spin-off title in the \"Mega Man Battle Network\" series. The game saw a simultaneous August 8, 2003 release in Japan on the WonderSwan Color and Swan Crystal titled . The GBA version was localized in North America and Europe the following March. It was released on the Wii U's Virtual Console on July 30, 2014 in Japan, with both the North American and PAL region release occurring in August 2014.\n\nTaking place within the timeline of the \"Battle Network\" series, \"Battle Chip Challenge\" involves a battling tournament called the \"Battle Chip GP\" among various pairs of online avatars called \"NetNavis\" and their human operators. Rather than directly control the player character through the traditional real-time tactical role-playing battles of the other \"Battle Network\" games, \"Battle Chip Challenge\" tasks the player with creating a \"Program Deck\" made up of abilities called \"Battle Chips\". The game randomly selects chips for the player and executes them in a duel with a computer-controlled opponent. \"Battle Chip Challenge\" suffered a relatively negative critical reception.\n\nThe plot of \"Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge\" involves the opening of a new netbattling tournament known as the \"Battle Chip GP\". Yai is sponsoring the event while the others enter it. Even Chaud enters the tournament, but only for official business. It turns out that there is some type of new organization behind the scenes of the tournament who will delete the winning Navi and take its data for themselves.\n\n\"Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge\" utilizes a different battle system from other \"Battle Network\" titles. In those games, the player may battle one or more enemies in real-time by utilizing special abilities called \"Battle Chips\" with the objective being to delete each enemy's hit points (HP). In this game, the player duels a single opponent simply by setting up 12 Battle Chips on a grid called a \"Program Deck\". The Program Deck has three columns of chips, with the first column having two chips, the second having three chips, and the last having four chips. The game selects three chips at random on one of the grid's rows, and the player's Navi uses them consecutively, ending the turn with that character's signature attack. Battle Chips have a variety of effects such as attacking, healing, and elemental status changes. \"Navi Chips\" will even summon other characters into the battle for a short time. After setting the deck, the player has little control over the match. Battles progress almost completely autonomously for upwards of ten rounds while the player watches for results. At certain points during the fight, the player may \"Slot In\" two chips to change the outcome of the battle.\n\nOne possible outcome of a turn is the destruction of an opponent's Battle Chips. Certain types of attacks not only do damage to an opponent's HP, but to their Program Deck as well, as each chip also has a set amount of HP. The player can win fights not only by utilizing power, but by deleting an opponents entire deck, making them unable to fight. If ten turns pass and neither competitor has lost all of their HP, the game determines the winner based on how many chips are left in their decks. The game also has an \"Open Battle\" feature in the game that allows the player to select a certain area with a set amount of consecutive battles to fight. Winning every fifth battle in one of these earns the player a new Navi Chip to use as well as a variable amount of \"Zenny\", the game's currency. Zenny can be used to purchase more chips from the character Higsby in the game's multiple shops. The game contains six different playable pairs of operators and their NetNavis including Lan and MegaMan, Dex and GutsMan, Mayl and Roll, and Chaud and ProtoMan. There are also two new duos: Kai and Turboman, and Mary and Ring. A multiplayer feature allows up to two players connect their GBAs for battles.\n\n\"Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge\" was co-developed by Capcom Production Studio 2 and Inti Creates, the latter of which also developed Capcom's \"Mega Man Zero\" and \"Mega Man ZX\" series. The game was first announced by Capcom on April 19, 2003. It was subsequently shown at the World Hobby Fair in Japan on June 21, 2003. An English localization of the game was announced by Capcom on October 21, 2003.\n\n\"Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge\" was not well received by most reviewers, currently holding an average score of 51% on GameRankings and a 54 out of 100 on Metacritic. Most reviewers such as IGN and GameSpy (among others) criticized the game for a lack of both player participation, and overall presentation. IGN even went as far as calling the it \"quite possibly the worst game to bear the \"Mega Man\" name\". Both reviews only praised the game's audio.\n\nThe GBA version of \"Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge\" was the 22nd best-selling game in Japan during its release week at 7,403 copies sold. A total of 44,844 copies of the game were sold in the region by the end of 2003 according to \"Famitsu\". \n\n"}

After the Acadians, Canning - first called Apple Tree Landing and later Habitant Corner - was settled in 1760 by New England Planters and by the Dutch following World War II. The present name was adopted in honour of British prime minister George Canning.\n\nThough much diminished in importance in recent years, Canning was once a major shipbuilding centre and shipping and rail hub for farmers in Kings County. Canning merchants and farmers founded the Cornwallis Valley Railway which ran from 1889 to 1961, connecting the village to the Dominion Atlantic Railway mainline in Kentville, Nova Scotia. The village suffered three major fires, in 1866, 1868 and 1912.\nThe Canadian parliamentarian Sir Frederick William Borden had a home in Canning.

There are several dozen publicized lodges in the U.S, Canada, Europe, and South America. The book \"The Frustrated Songwriter's Handbook\" details the ICS approach to creative songwriting.\n\nThe Immersion Composition Society was started in Oakland, California by two songwriters, Nicholas Dobson and Michael Iago Mellender. Noticing that they were spending large amounts of time thinking about music and waiting for inspiration to strike — instead of actually writing music — in early 2001 they developed a new songwriting method that involved composing prolifically while trying to avoid any kind of self-editing or self-consciousness.\n\nThe result was a songwriting \"game\" that took place over the course of a single day. They both began to play it compulsively. Within a year, Dobson and Mellender had formed a society of songwriters, and this game — which came to be called the \"20-Song Game\", was its central activity.\n\nThe ICS is made up of local chapters called \"lodges\" (the first of which was the Wig Lodge, founded by Bay Area composer/musician Steven Clark). An ICS lodge is not unlike a small, local secret society of songwriters. The lodge exists as a way for all of the members to force themselves to write as much music as possible. The privacy and secrecy of a lodge are there to create a \"safe\" environment for musical experimentation, free of unwanted criticism and negative social pressure. The members of an ICS lodge do their best to support each other completely, and each member is encouraged to indulge any musical whim or subject matter — no matter how ridiculous or questionable it may seem to the songwriter at the time. Each lodge has a \"lodge head,\" and any number of members, averaging up to a dozen.\n\nThe 20-Song Game works like this:\n\n\nAs more lodges were formed, ICS members from all over began to create regional variations, session themes, and new games with names like \"Hat-Lib,\" \"Spooling,\" and \"Composer Tennis\". Elaborate track swapping also became popular during this period, especially as a form of international musical collaboration. By now it had become common for Society members to personalize the 20-Song Game over time, cycling through periods with higher and lower volume goals. This was the point when ICS methodology started to evolve into a larger system for songwriters that could be used to tackle more or less any goal that the user wanted, including low-volume goals such as developing production, arrangement, and craft. A popular example is a member invoking \"album clause,\" where for the purpose of working toward an album project, the member suspends some of the ICS customs at his or her whim.\n\nThe songwriting method employed by the ICS is detailed in \"The Frustrated Songwriter's Handbook\" (), written by Nicholas Dobson and Karl Coryat and published by Backbeat Books. The book details the philosophy of the ICS and refers to the ICS songwriting system as \"Immersion Music Method.\" Tim Rice-Oxley has said he uses the method to write songs for Keane, and Jez Williams, guitarist for British band Doves, has cited the book as inspiration for their 2009 album \"Kingdom of Rust.\" Members of the American experimental rock band Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, and many others have also reported using IMM's \"songwriting games\" at times to generate material for albums.\n\nAs of January 2012, forty to fifty \"official\" lodges have been documented (not all are listed here).\n\n"}

According to the U.S. Government Project Officer's Interim Report on the Starfish Prime project:\n\nPrevious high-altitude nuclear tests: YUCCA, TEAK, and ORANGE, plus the three ARGUS shots were poorly instrumented and hastily executed. Despite thorough studies of the meager data, present models of these bursts are sketchy and tentative. These models are too uncertain to permit extrapolation to other altitudes and yields with any confidence. Thus there is a strong need, not only for better instrumentation, but for further tests covering a range of altitudes and yields.\nThe Starfish test was originally planned as the second in the Fishbowl series, but the first launch (Bluegill) was lost by the radar tracking equipment and had to be destroyed in flight.\n\nThe initial Starfish launch attempt on June 20 was aborted in flight due to failure of the Thor launch vehicle. The Thor missile flew a normal trajectory for 59 seconds; then the rocket engine stopped, and the missile began to break apart. The range safety officer ordered the destruction of the missile and warhead. The missile was between in altitude when it was destroyed. Parts of the missile and some radioactive contamination fell upon Johnston Atoll and nearby Sand Island and the surrounding ocean. \n\nOn July 9, 1962, at 09:00:09 Coordinated Universal Time (11:00:09 p.m. on July 8, Honolulu time), the Starfish Prime test was detonated at an altitude of . The coordinates of the detonation were . The actual weapon yield came very close to the design yield, which various sources have set at different values in the range of 1.4 to 1.45 megatons (6.0 PJ). The nuclear warhead detonated 13 minutes 41 seconds after liftoff of the Thor missile from Johnston Atoll.\n\nStarfish Prime caused an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) that was far larger than expected, so much larger that it drove much of the instrumentation off scale, causing great difficulty in getting accurate measurements. The Starfish Prime electromagnetic pulse also made those effects known to the public by causing electrical damage in Hawaii, about away from the detonation point, knocking out about 300 streetlights, setting off numerous burglar alarms, and damaging a telephone company microwave link. The EMP damage to the microwave link shut down telephone calls from Kauai to the other Hawaiian islands.\n\nA total of 27 small rockets were launched from Johnston Atoll to obtain experimental data from the Starfish Prime detonation. In addition, a large number of rocket-borne instruments were launched from Barking Sands, Kauai, in the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nA large number of United States military ships and aircraft were operating in support of Starfish Prime in the Johnston Atoll area and across the nearby North Pacific region.\n\nA few military ships and aircraft were also positioned in the region of the South Pacific Ocean near the Samoan Islands. This location was at the southern end of the magnetic field line of the Earth's magnetic field from the position of the nuclear detonation, an area known as the \"southern conjugate region\" for the test. An uninvited scientific expeditionary ship from the Soviet Union was stationed near Johnston Atoll for the test, and another Soviet scientific expeditionary ship was in the southern conjugate region near the Samoan Islands.\n\nAfter the Starfish Prime detonation, bright auroras were observed in the detonation area, as well as in the southern conjugate region on the other side of the equator from the detonation. According to one of the first technical reports:\nThese auroral effects were partially anticipated by Nicholas Christofilos, a scientist who had earlier worked on the Operation Argus high-altitude nuclear shots.\n\nAccording to U.S. atomic veteran Cecil R. Coale, some hotels in Hawaii offered \"rainbow bomb\" parties on their roofs for Starfish Prime, contradicting some reports that the artificial aurora was unexpected.\n\n\"A 'Quick Look' at the Technical Results of Starfish Prime\" (August 1962) states:\nA 2006 report described the particle and field measurements of the Starfish diamagnetic cavity and the injected beta flux into the artificial radiation belt. These measurements describe the explosion from 0.1 milliseconds to 16 minutes after the detonation.\n\nWhile some of the energetic beta particles followed the Earth's magnetic field and illuminated the sky, other high-energy electrons became trapped and formed radiation belts around the Earth. There was much uncertainty and debate about the composition, magnitude and potential adverse effects from this trapped radiation after the detonation. The weaponeers became quite worried when three satellites in low Earth orbit were disabled. These included TRAAC and Transit 4B. The half-life of the energetic electrons was only a few days. At the time it was not known that solar and cosmic particle fluxes varied by a factor of 10, and energies could exceed 1 MeV. In the months that followed these man-made radiation belts eventually caused six or more satellites to fail, as radiation damaged their solar arrays or electronics, including the first commercial relay communication satellite, Telstar, as well as the United Kingdom's first satellite, Ariel 1. Detectors on Telstar, TRAAC, Injun, and Ariel 1 were used to measure distribution of the radiation produced by the tests.\n\nIn 1963, it was reported that Starfish Prime had created a belt of MeV electrons. In 1968, it was reported that some Starfish electrons had remained for 5 years.\n\nThe \"Starfish\" bomb contained Cd-109 tracer, which helped work out the seasonal mixing rate of polar and tropical air masses.\n\nThe \"Starfish\" EMP waveform measured by Richard L. Wakefield of Los Alamos led to a revolution in understanding this nuclear effect.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2173813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2173813", "title": "Ture Nerman", "text": "Ture Nerman\n\nTure Nerman (18 May 1886, in Norrköping – 7 October 1969) was a Swedish socialist. As a journalist and author, he was a well-known political activist in his time. He also wrote poems and songs.\n\nNerman was a vegetarian and a strict teetotaler. Alcoholism was a major social problem in Sweden in the early 20th century, and Nerman considered alcohol to be a drug that made the working class passive instead of fighting for better conditions.\n\nTure Nerman had younger twin brothers, the artist Einar Nerman and the archeologist Birger Nerman.\n\nNerman grew up in a middle-class family in the working-class, industrial city of Norrköping. His father owned a bookstore in the city and had married an employee who was many years younger: she became the mother of Ture and his two younger brothers. As a boy, Ture Nerman loved reading the books at his fathers store, especially western books about cowboys and Indians.\n\nNerman graduated from Norrköping gymnasium (secondary school) in 1903 at the age of 17. On his graduation day he took his school bible and tossed it in the Motala ström river. In his autobiography, Nerman describes this as his first revolutionary action. Some years later when he was asked by the Swedish Social Democratic Party's leader Hjalmar Branting what had made him a socialist, Nerman answered that it had been the questioning of religion.\n\nAfter graduation he moved to Uppsala to study at Uppsala University.\n\nThe year 1905 saw both a revolution in Russia and revolutionary development in Scandinavia as Norway declared itself independent from the rule of the Swedish crown. These changes radicalized Ture Nerman politically to the left. He had already started reading August Strindberg, Leo Tolstoy and Ellen Key. Soon he would discover Karl Marx (even if it took many years until he fully started to study and understand Marxism). Nerman started going to socialist youth meetings in Uppsala.\n\nIn 1907, Nerman was conscripted for military service. By his own request, he got medical training. Nerman had already developed an anti-militarist standpoint and in 1908 he was caught by the secret police handing out illegal anti-militarist leaflets. He was first convicted to jail, but the penalty was altered to a 300 kronor fine. His father sent him the money, but the rebellious son used it to finance a trip to Paris, where he stayed a couple of weeks. Upon returning to Sweden he was once again sent money by his father to pay off the fine to avoid going to jail.\n\nIn 1909, Nerman moved to the northern city of Sundsvall where he started working as a writer for a Social Democratic newspaper called \"Nya Samhället\", (New Society). At this point Nerman had already gotten a couple of his poetry books published. Many of these were radical, provocative poems, aimed against the church, the Swedish king and the bourgeoisie.\n\nTure Nerman joined the Swedish Social Democratic Party and soon became part of the left wing together with Zeth Höglund. He became one of the leaders of the left opposition of the party against its reformist leader Hjalmar Branting.\n\nOn New Year's Day in 1912, and the following weeks, Nerman and some of his Swedish friends went to Germany to follow Karl Liebknecht during his election campaign. Nerman had met Liebknecht briefly a couple of years earlier on a socialist gathering in Stockholm, but this time they got to know each other well. In his autobiography, Nerman writes that he was surprised and impressed to learn that Liebknecht could speak almost fluent Swedish and liked to sing songs by Bellman.\n\nIn November 1912, Nerman attended the special emergency convention of the Socialist International, which had been summoned to Basel in Switzerland, due to the outbreak of the Balkan Wars. At the convention, the leaders of all the European Socialist parties agreed to stand together internationally to prevent any future wars. With a united international working class, they stated, there could be no more wars.\n\nTherefore, the outbreak of World War I in 1914, and the collapse of the Socialist International, came as a shock to Ture Nerman. Almost all the leaders of the European Socialist Parties suddenly sided with their bourgeoisie governments in support of the war, and turned against their former Socialist allies. Workers were killing workers on the battlefields.\n\nBut there were exceptions. His friend Karl Liebknecht stood alone in the Berlin Reichstag, and against 110 of his own Party members, when he voted against German war credits. Learning of Liebknecht's action, Ture Nerman knew which side he was on.\n\nTogether with his friend Zeth Höglund, Ture Nerman represented the Swedish-Norwegian members of the Zimmerwald Conference. It united the remaining international socialist anti-war movement, whose more prominent leaders were Vladimir Lenin, Grigory Zinoviev and Leon Trotsky from Russia, Robert Grimm from Switzerland, and Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht from Germany. Those two could not participate, but sent their greetings and support. Luxemburg was in jail for anti-war propaganda, while Liebknecht had been mobilized by the German military to dig trenches on the frontline. Returning to Sweden, Zeth Höglund was also sentenced to jail for his activities in the international anti-war movement, even though Sweden didn't participate in the World War.\n\nAt the start of the year 1915, (before Zimmerwald), Nerman travelled around in the United States for several months. To finance the trip he wrote articles for several Swedish newspapers. He arrived by boat in New York City where he stayed only for a short time but took the chance to go up to the top of the Woolworth Building, the highest skyscraper in the world at the time. He took the express train across the continent to San Francisco where he visited the World's Fair on opening day.\n\nTure Nerman then started a tour speaking to American workers, mostly of Scandinavian origin, in Minneapolis and Chicago.\n\nHe also took some time to visit some relatives in Astoria, Oregon.\n\nWhen Ture Nerman returned in the mid summer to Sweden, Zeth Höglund complained, asking if it really had been necessary of him to go to America when he was so much needed at home in the intensifying class battle and the struggle within the Swedish Social Democratic Party between the left wing and the right wing.\n\nAt the beginning of 1917, the struggle between the left and the right within the Social Democratic Party resulted in a split. Zeth Höglund and Ture Nerman, now considering themselves \"Communists\", were expelled from the Party together with other prominent radicals such as Kata Dalström, Fredrik Ström and Stockholm's mayor Carl Lindhagen.\n\nHöglund, who was the leader of the Party's youth organisation, managed to get the whole young socialists on his side in the foundation of the \"Swedish Social Democratic Left Party\". The new party was formed in May 1917 and had around 20,000 members. It would soon change name and become the first Communist Party of Sweden. They launched a newspaper, \"Politiken\", in which they wrote and published texts by other international communist leaders.\n\nIn April 1917, when Lenin passed through Stockholm on his journey from exile in Switzerland home to Petrograd, Ture Nerman was one of those who greeted Lenin and took care of him while there. For instance, the Swedish Communists took Lenin to the PUB department store, where they bought him a brand-new suit so he would look good and clean coming back home to Russia.\n\nUpon Lenin's return in Russia and the October Revolution that followed, Ture Nerman and the Left Social Democrats fully supported the Bolsheviks and agitated for a similar Communist revolution in Sweden.\n\nAs an international representative of the \"Swedish Communist Party\", Nerman had several communist contacts from all over the world: His friend Karl Liebknecht; Karl Radek, the Polish Bolshevik who had lived in Stockholm for a while; The Ukrainian-Italian socialist leader Angelica Balabanoff, who lived and worked in Stockholm; and Yrjö Sirola and Otto Kuusinen, two prominent Finnish communist leaders visited Ture Nerman in Stockholm several times.\n\nNerman also corresponded with the American socialist leaders Eugene V. Debs, John Reed (who helped him write a book on the first World War (\"Folkhatet\")) and the American communist leader Max Eastman, who provided Nerman with a subscription to \"The Liberator\".\n\nAt the end of the summer of 1918, Ture Nerman traveled together with Angelica Balabanoff and Anton Nilson to Bolshevik Russia.\n\nIn Petrograd, Nerman was invited two visit the home of Zinoviev, who was the leader of the Petrograd Soviet. They knew each other from Zimmerwald. Zinoviev asked him: \"When will you make revolution in Sweden?\" Nerman replied modestly that they did not have a definitive date yet.\nThe next day Nerman attended a rally outside the Winter Palace, in which Zinoviev and Balabanoff spoke to the red soldiers heading out to fight in the civil war.\n\nAfter spending some days in Petrograd, the trip continued to Moscow, where Nerman was greeted by Kamenev and his wife, the sister of Trotsky. Nerman was welcomed to live with the Kamenev family at the Kremlin.\n\nOn 3 October, Nerman attended a grand meeting at the Bolshoi Theatre. Amongst the speakers were Sverdlov, Radek, Bukharin and the main speaker Trotsky. Lenin, who recently had been shot and wounded, could not attend, but his greetings were received with cheers and applause.\nAfterwards Nerman spoke briefly with Trotsky who was in a hurry to go out and fight in the Civil War the same night. Nerman mentioned that the Swedish press, and even the Social Democratic newspapers, wrote almost every day that the Soviet government was about to fall, but still it remained. \"Yes,\" answered Trotsky with a stern smile, \"and we will remain.\"\n\nThe day after, Nerman got to sit down with Bukharin for a long interview, in which Bukharin expressed his optimism in the world revolution and socialist future. The same day he met with Alexandra Kollontay, the female Bolshevik leader, who later would be the Soviet ambassador to Sweden.\n\nTure Nerman returned to Sweden through the Finnish archipelago in late October. The positive energies he had massed from his experience in revolutionary Russia were replaced with devastation after hearing of the failed German revolution of 1918/1919, and the murdering of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg.\n\nTure Nerman made his second trip to Russia with Otto Grimlund in the spring of 1920, where he got to meet with Lenin, this time as the guest, after having been the host in Stockholm April 1917.\n\nUpon returning to Sweden in the summer he learned about the death of his father. His family had tried to delay the funeral, but still he had missed it.\n\nTure Nerman would make one more trip to Russia, in 1927. It was the tenth anniversary of the revolution. Lenin was dead now and things had started to change.\n\nTure Nerman condemned the rise of Stalinism in Russia, but when Zeth Höglund broke with the Communist Party in 1924, Ture Nerman remained, although less involved in the leadership. The party's new leadership was composed of Karl Kilbom and Nils Flyg.\n\nIn 1929 the Comintern made sure that the power of the \"Swedish Communist Party\" was taken over by the minority fraction of Stalinists led by Hugo Sillén. The majority of the party's members, the non-Stalinists, were expelled, including Ture Nerman, Karl Kilbom and Nils Flyg. The minority (Stalinists) seized the party's headquarter and its archives, but the majority (non-Stalinists) managed to keep control over the newspaper \"Politiken\".\n\nThe majority, under the leadership of Kilbom, tried to keep running a Swedish Communist Party independent from Moscow. In 1934 this party took the name Socialist Party (Socialistiska partiet).\n\nIn 1931 Ture Nerman, 44 years old, was elected to the first chamber of the Riksdag, where he served till 1937 as a representative of the independent communist Party. When he held speeches in the chamber, he usually tried to make them into poems.\n\nIn 1937, Ture Nerman and his friend August Spångberg, traveled to Spain where General Francisco Franco's National faction had taken power and a civil war was ravaging the country. They went through Nazi Germany and managed to get to Barcelona. The civil war was a chaos. At times the Stalinists were fighting the Trotskyists, and at other times the Anarchists were fighting everyone. The Nationalists under Francisco Franco benefited from the massive support of Nazi-Germany (financial and military: Legion Condor) and fascist Italy.\n\nOn 3 May, serious fighting between the different leftist groups broke out in Barcelona, and Hotel Victoria, where the Swedes were staying, was caught in the crossfire which lasted for three days. At the same hotel, Ture Nerman for the first time met Willy Brandt, (the German Social Democrat who would later live in exile Sweden during World War II and after that become Chancellor of West Germany.) On 7 May, the fighting in Barcelona was over with more than 500 dead and over 1,500 wounded.\n\nAfterwards, by orders from the Comintern, Stalinist press all over the world would claim that the Swedish \"\"Trotskyist Fascists\"\" Ture Nerman and August Spångberg were the masterminds of the battle in Barcelona. Nerman wrote in his autobiography: \"I was falsely accused by the Stalinists of being in a pact with Hitler. But in reality, not much more than a year later, Stalin himself would be in a pact with Hitler.\"\n\nWhen he return home to Sweden from the chaos in Spain he was met by a chaos in his own Socialist Party, the independent communist party.\n\nNils Flyg had taken power and expelled the former party leader Karl Kilbom. Flyg wanted Ture Nerman to stay but he didn't like the development of the party and left voluntarily. (A couple of years later, Nils Flyg would suddenly become pro-Nazi and take the Socialist Party with him on this new course.)\n\nFor the next two years Ture Nerman was without a party and he also lost his seat in the Parliament. In 1939, choosing the date of First of May, Ture Nerman re-joined the Swedish Social Democratic Party.\n\nOn 20 April 1933, a couple of months after Hitler had taken power in Germany, Nerman stood up in the Swedish parliament and demanded that Sweden should grant asylum for all German Jews who would like to come. The issue was taken up for vote, but voted against.\n\nWhen World War II broke out in 1939 Sweden declared itself neutral, but Ture Nerman was not neutral. During the war, Ture Nerman was best known as the editor of \"Trots allt!\" (\"Despite Everything!\"), an anti-Nazi paper that caused furor at the German Embassy in Stockholm. \"Trots allt!\" also criticized the Swedish government for, out of fear of Hitler, allowing German troop transports through Sweden. At its peak, the weekly paper achieved a circulation of 66,000 in 1942.\n\nThe paper borrowed its name from a text by Karl Liebknecht, \"Trotz alledem!\", which he wrote on the day before he was murdered in 1919.\n\nAt first the Swedish government didn't tolerate \"Trots Allt!\" since it broke with the neutrality. Many of Nerman's anti-war and anti-Nazi writings of this time were not allowed to be published by the censorship. Ture Nerman was even sentenced to jail for three months in the winter of 1939. But the paper was very popular and a lot of financial help came in from supporters.\n\nIn 1940, Nerman was sentenced to three months in prison by Swedish authorities for writing an article in \"Trots Allt!\" where Nerman claimed that Hitler had ordered a 1939 bombing and assassination attempt in a Münich beer cellar. Nerman was a parliamentarian at the time of his conviction.\n\nOne of Nerman's closest collaborators in those days was Israel Holmgren, who also was sentenced to jail.\n\nAt the end of 1942, Ture Nerman ran into his former friend Nils Flyg in the streets of Stockholm. Nils Flyg who now had developed into a Nazi supporter. Nerman asked him: \"What are you going to do now?\" Flyg said: \"I’m going to save Sweden – and I’m going to save you too!\" Ture Nerman gave him an ironic \"Thank you.\" They never saw each other again: only a couple of weeks later Nils Flyg died.\n\nOn 7 May 1945 Nazi Germany finally surrendered. On 16 May, Ture Nerman went to the liberated Norway together with a group of Norwegian refugees returning from their exile in Sweden. \"Trots Allt!\" had been a great supporter of the Norwegian freedom struggle against the Nazi occupation and smuggled in illegal issues of the paper had been were popular amongst the Norwegians.\n\nTure Nerman had a seat in the parliament 1946–1953. He retired after that, at 67 years of age. For the next three years (1954 till 1957) Nerman served as publisher of the bimonthly magazine Kulturkontakt, a publication of the CIA-backed Congress of Cultural Freedom and the Svenska kommittén för kulturens frihet (Swedish Committee for Cultural Freedom).\n\nThis confirms his positive opinions about the United States and the United Nations. He even became an advocate of Swedish membership in NATO. The red Soviet flag with the hammer and the sickle outside his house in Blidö, an island in the Stockholm archipelago, was an ironic reference to his earlier beliefs.\n\nHe died in 1969.\n\nTure Nerman has a small street named after him in Kungsholmen, Stockholm. \"Ture Nermans gränd\", and a street in Bergen, Norway. \"Ture Nermans vei\".\n\n\n"}

In 1854, General Louis Faidherbe was appointed Governor of Senegal and soon began an expansion of French interests into the interior savannahs of what is now Senegal and Mali. The expansion began by going up the Senegal River and establishing a series of forts. The army moved troops, cannon and other supplies by steamship where possible and overland where not.\n\nIn 1848, Omar Tall launched his jihad against neighboring Malinké regions. By 1855, his rapid expansion had led to several skirmishes with the French army. With the authorization of his ally, Khasso Queen Hawa Demba Diallo, Governor Faidherbe ordered a fort built at the Khasso town of Medina, not far from Kayes.\n\nIn April 1857, Omar Tall declared war against the Khasso kingdom, and marched on Fort Medina, their nearest outpost, with an army of between 15,000 and 20,000, which included riflemen armed with French rifles. The fort at the time had about 7,000 inhabitants, with some French but mostly Khasso troops. Omar Tall laid siege to the fort and began a series of assaults that resulted in hundreds of casualties for the Toucouleur army. In the 97 days that followed, the defenders' food supplies soon ran low, and the fort was on the verge of surrendering when, in mid-July, Faidherbe arrived by steamboat with supplies and 500 reinforcements, breaking the siege.\n\nFollowing the relief of Fort Medina, Faidherbe signed a treaty with the Omar Tall gaining concessions for the French down to the Niger River.\n\nRealizing the difficulties of attacking the well-equipped French, Omar Tall turned his attention to the neighboring Bambara Empire, conquering most of its territory including its capital of Ségou in 1861. However, the French continued to expand their West African presence, conquering Ségou and the Toucouleur Empire less than thirty years after Omar Taal's death.\n\nThe Fort du Medine is open to the public. The Fort is located about 12 km east of Kayes on the \"road to Bamako.\" There is also an old railroad station and European-style cemetery with graves from the mid-19th century. The village population is around 1800 with a small market daily.\n\n"}

He was married twice; in 1641 with Cornelia, a sister of Abraham Furnerius, living in Rotterdam, and in 1657 with Margaretha van Rhijn from Amsterdam. Philip studied painting under his brother Jacob in Rotterdam. After his second marriage he moved to Amsterdam. According to the Dutch writer on art Arnold Houbraken, Koninck completed his training in Rembrandt’s studio in Amsterdam.\nIn the late 1640s, De Koninck, began to paint panoramas, his canvases divided in half, horizontally, between equal measures of earth and sky. Koninck was evidently much affected by Rembrandt etchings like 'The Goldweigher's Field', which looked across a broad sweep of country layered with bands of shade and light. Also the style of Hercules Segers is to be detected in his work.\nImpressionable and single-minded, Philips Koninck began to paint like this for the next decade, almost all his panoramas pieced together as if narrow ribbons of darkness and brightness had been laid across the canvas. He was a great success, enough of one, at any rate, to buy and operate a barge line that ran between Amsterdam and Rotterdam via Leiden, so that his business could travel through his own landscapes.\n\nHe painted chiefly broad, sunny landscapes, full of space, light and atmosphere; they are seen from a high perspective, allowing a prominent view of the sky. Portraits by him, somewhat in the manner of Rembrandt, also exist (e.g. see Joost van den Vondel); there are examples of these in the galleries at Copenhagen and Oslo. Of his landscapes, the principal are \"View at the mouth of a river\" at the Hague, with a slightly larger replica in the National Gallery, London; \"Woodland border and countryside\" (with figures by Adriaen van de Velde) at Amsterdam; and landscapes in Brussels, Florence (the Uffizi), Berlin and Cologne. Koninck, a prosperous businessman, living on Reguliersgracht, appears to have painted only a few pictures during the last decade of his life.\n\nSeveral of his works have been falsely attributed to Rembrandt and many more to his nephew Salomon de Koninck (1609–1656), a disciple of Rembrandt, whose paintings and etchings consist mainly of portraits and biblical scenes. He was also the uncle of the painters Jacob II and Daniel Koninck.\n\nAll of these painters are to be distinguished from David Koninck (1636?-1687), also known as Rammelaar. David Koninck was born in Antwerp and studied there under Jan Fyt. He later settled in Rome, where he is stated to have died in 1687; this, however, is doubtful. His pictures are chiefly landscapes with animals and still life.\n\n"}

Originally made from paper or wood, modern amulets are small items usually kept inside a brocade bag and may contain a prayer, religious inscription of invocation. \"Omamori\" are available at both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples with few exceptions and are available for sale, regardless of one's religious affiliation.\n\n\"Omamori\" are then made sacred through the use of ritual, and are said to contain \"busshin\" (spiritual offshoots) in a Shinto context or \"kesshin\" (manifestations) in a Buddhist context.\n\nWhile \"omamori\" are intended for temple tourists' personal use, they are mainly viewed as a donation to the temple or shrine the person is visiting. Visitors often give \"omamori\" as a gift to another person as a physical form of well-wishing.\n\nThe amulet covering is usually made of brocaded silk and encloses papers or pieces of wood with prayers written on them which are supposed to bring good luck to the bearer on particular occasions, tasks, or ordeals. \"Omamori\" are also used to ward off bad luck and are often spotted on bags, hung on cellphone straps, in cars, etc.\n\n\"Omamori\" have changed over the years from being made mostly of paper and/or wood to being made out of a wide variety of materials (i.e. bumper decals, bicycle reflectors, credit cards, etc.). Modern commercialism has also taken over a small part of the creations of \"omamori\". Usually this happens when more popular shrines and temples cannot keep up with the high demand for certain charms. They then turn to factories to manufacture the \"omamori\". However, priests have been known to complain about the quality and authenticity of the products made by factories.\n\nAccording to Yanagita Kunio (1969):\n\n\"Omamori\" may provide general blessings and protection, or may have a specific focus such as:\n\n\nCustomarily, \"omamori\" are not opened in order to avoid losing their protective benefits. They're carried on one's person, or tied to something like a backpack or a purse. It is not necessary, but amulets are customarily replaced once a year to ward off bad luck from the previous year. Old amulets are usually returned to the same shrine or temple they were purchased at so they can be disposed of properly. Amulets are commonly returned on or slightly after New Year’s. This way the shrine/temple visitor has a fresh start for the New Year with a new \"omamori\".\n\nOld \"omamori\" traditionally should not be disposed of, but burned, as a sign of respect to the deity that assisted the person throughout the year.\n\nIf a shrine or temple visitor cannot find an \"omamori\" that meets their need, they can request for a priest to have one made. If enough people request for this same type of \"omamori\", the temple or shrine may start producing them for everyday availability.\n\nThere are modern commercial versions for these that are typically not spiritual in nature and are not issued by a shrine or temple. It has become popular for stores in Japan to feature generic \"omamori\" with popular characters such as Mickey Mouse, Hello Kitty, Snoopy, Kewpie, etc.\n\n\n"}

It was developed by Curtiss-Wright in response to a request by the United States Navy in 1941 to produce a new shipboard high-performance fighter aircraft.\n\nIn 1941 the US Navy requested a better-performing carrier-based fighter plane, to be powered by the proposed high performance 24-cylinder liquid cooled Lycoming XH-2470 Hyper engine. This was an unusual step for the Navy, which had been adamant to that time that all its aircraft use air-cooled radial engines.\n\nOn June 30, 1941 a contract for two prototype aircraft, designated the XF14C-1, was awarded to the Curtiss-Wright company. On the same date prototype development contracts were also awarded to Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation for the single-engine XF6F-1 and the twin engine XF7F-1, both of which would use air-cooled Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp radial engines.\n\nEarly in the development the Navy requested better altitude performance and, in view of unsatisfactory progress in the development of the XH-2470 engine, Curtiss adapted the design of the aircraft around the new turbocharged Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone air-cooled radial engine. The aircraft equipped with this eighteen-cylinder twin-row radial air-cooled engine and three bladed contra-rotating propellers was designated the XF14C-2. The XF14C-1 was canceled. Also, looking at the problems of operation at altitudes of about 40,000 feet (12,000 m), the Navy also initiated work on a third version with a pressurized cockpit designated the XF14C-3.\n\nUltimately, only the XF14C-2 prototype was completed, flying for the first time in July 1944. Moreover, disappointment with performance estimates and delays with the availability of the XR-3350-16 engine coupled with the evaporating tactical need for an extremely high-altitude fighter led to cancellation of the development.\n\n"}

He edited two volumes of the academy's proceedings under the title \"Collegium Experimentale\" (1676 and 1685).\n\nSturm is the author of \"Physica Electiva\" (1697), a book that criticized Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and prompted him to publish a rebuke. Sturm's critique was aimed at Leibniz's view that Nature and/or its constituent parts possess some creative force of their own. This criticism was partly theological, in that Sturm claimed Leibniz's view of Nature undermined the sovereignty of the Christian God.\n\n"}

As a batsman Gaekwad \"possessed a sure defence and delightfully crisp shots especially through the covers\". He was also an occasional leg spin bowler. As of 2018, he is India's oldest living Test cricketer.\n\nGaekwad played his early cricket for Bombay University and the Maharaja Sayaji University in Baroda. He made his Test debut in the first Test of 1952 tour of England, in Leeds. He opened the innings for India despite never having done so before the tour. He was one among four victims dismissed for no score in the second innings of the Test. His West Indies tour in the next year was terminated during the second Test when he collided with Vijay Hazare while going for a catch and dislocated his shoulder.\n\nIn 1956–58, he captained Baroda to their first Ranji title in nine years. He scored a double hundred against the defending champions Bombay during the course of the season. This was followed by a recall to the Indian team for the final Test against West Indies in 1958–59. His 52 in the second innings was the only fifty of his career and went some way towards India earning a draw. With Hemu Adhikari, who had captained in this match, being unavailable, Gaekwad led the Indian team to the tour of England in 1959. India lost all the five matches and Gaekwad did not appear in another Test.\n\nIn Ranji Trophy, he scored 3139 runs with 14 centuries and a highest of 249 against Maharashtra in 1959–60. \n\nGaekwad is the father of the Indian opener Anshuman Gaekwad.

Together with its preparatory school and nursery at Brandeston Hall, it serves pupils from 3 to 18 years of age.\n\nFramlingham College was originally called The Albert Middle Class College in Suffolk in memory of Prince Albert and was founded in 1864 by public subscription as the Suffolk County Memorial to Queen Victoria's husband, Albert, Prince Consort, and was incorporated by Royal Charter. The individuals most involved in setting up of the school were Sir Edward Kerrison, 2nd Baronet, Richard Garrett and the Earl of Stradbroke. The land on which the college was built was originally part of the Castle estate, left by Sir Robert Hitcham in 1636 to Pembroke Hall, Cambridge. The architect was Fredrick Peck of Furnival's Inn, London. Built to accommodate 300 boys, the college opened its doors to pupils on 10 April 1865.\n\nIn J. R. de S. Honey's book \"Tom Brown's Universe: Public School in the Nineteenth Century\", he reviewed the 64 leading public schools of the time and classified Framlingham as being in 'Group 4' of these schools, considering it to be a school that interacted less than it should with other leading schools.\n\nDuring 1940, because of Framlingham's position close to the Suffolk coast (a likely site for a possible German invasion), and as a result of the crisis unfolding at Dunkirk, pupils from the college were evacuated for a short time to Repton School in Derbyshire.\n\nThe college's prep school at Brandeston Hall was opened by Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone in July 1949. The hall had been purchased and restored by The Society of Old Framlinghamians as a memorial to those of their number who \"in two Great Wars gave their lives for the freedom of the world\".\n\nLouise North became Principal of Framlingham College and Head of the Senior School in September 2019. She was formerly Senior Deputy Head at Oakham School, Rutland. The school received an excellent ISI Inspection Report in February 2015 and an Outstanding Ofsted report in February 2011.\n\nPupils are accommodated in seven boarding and day houses: three for girls and four for boys. The facilities at Framlingham College include a theatre with tiered seating for 250, a design and technology centre, a music department including various studios and recording facilities, a library, a Sixth form centre which opened in 2014, a leisure centre that houses an indoor swimming pool, a fitness suite and weights room. The original library, which was given to the college by Charles H. Berners, Esq. DL in 1899, was extended in 1998.\n\nThe school has two campuses situated on approximately 135 acres. The college campus sits in an elevated position and looks directly across to the 12th-century Framlingham Castle beyond. Between the college and the castle lies the 34-acre Framlingham Mere, owned by the college and managed by Suffolk Wildlife Trust. The Mere is a nature reserve. The prep school campus at Brandeston Hall is a mock tudorbethan hall set in its own grounds and faces the medieval Church of All Saints, Brandeston.\n\nThe most recent ISI inspection (2015) adjudged the teaching and learning at the college as 'Excellent'.\n\nFramlingham College campus includes an indoor swimming pool, multi-gym, weights room and large playing fields. Other facilities include a modern sports hall, two floodlit artificial hockey pitches, indoor rifle range, tennis, netball and squash courts. As well as its own golf course on site, home matches are played at Aldeburgh Golf Club. The cricket square hosted an England XI in 2010. Framlingham College featured in \"The Cricketer\" magazine's Top 100 Cricketing Schools for 2016.\nThe major sports are rugby, hockey, cricket, athletics and tennis for boys, and hockey, netball and tennis for girls. The girls also have a cricket team and have an annual fixture against the MCC. Pupils can also take part in golf, squash, football, badminton, athletics, basketball, swimming, archery, shooting, canoeing, table tennis, and equestrian.\n\n\nFramlingham College was the subject of a Channel 4 documentary called Classmates in 2003.\nThe buildings and interiors of Framlingham College were used in series 2 of the BBC comedy \"Detectorists\", first broadcast in November 2015.\n\n\nThree Old Framlinghamians have won the Victoria Cross, and one the George Cross (converted from the Albert Medal).\n\n\n\n\n"}

The village has been described as \"a quaint English drinking village, with a fishing problem\"; is a popular bathing place and is characterised by Georgian architecture.\n\nAt the 2011 Census, it had a population of 1,762. Its northern boundary follows the Teign estuary and its eastern boundary the English Channel. The village is part of the electoral ward of Shaldon and Stokeinteignhead, with a population in 2011 of 2,465.\n\nShaldon was in the hundred of Wonford. The original river settlement was upstream in Ringmore where the valley was farmed, and the inhabitants were hidden from the sea. Up to the beginning of the 20th century, Ringmore had many working farms, extensive apple and other orchards, including cider apples, watercress beds, and withy beds used for making lobster pots. There were also shipbuilding and repair yards on the waterfront.\n\nShaldon itself is built on reclaimed land, and there is a retaining wall, built around 1800, to prevent the river returning to its beaches. In 2012 a beach hut measuring 23 ft by 6 ft at Shaldon was put on the market for £245,000 and was at that time thought to be the most expensive beach hut in the UK.\n\nShaldon is part of Teignbridge local government district, which was created in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The village had previously been in St Nicholas Parish. The parish contained Shaldon and part of the adjacent village of Ringmore, and became part of Teignmouth Urban District in 1881.\n\nThe Shaldon regatta is one of the oldest in England dating back to at least 1817, if not before. The modern regatta runs for 9 days each August.\n\nOn a hillside above the village are gardens created by Maria 'Laetitia' Kempe Homeyard in the late 1920s and early 1930s and built by Thomas Rider, consisting of an informal terraced arboretum with a level walk along the top providing views of the Teign estuary and the Jurassic Coast. A feature of the gardens is a folly known as Shaldon Castle. First opened to the public in 1955 and currently under the stewardship of Teignbridge District Council, the gardens are open all year round.\n\n"}

Such a chart is interpreted to gain insight into influences surrounding the event and an outlook for possible developments stemming from that event.\n\nFor example, astrologers can erect a chart for a major event, such as a marriage, and interpret it as though the event were a person in its own right. For example, if a chart was cast for the date of one's marriage then the chart would give an indication of what the couple can expect during their married life. If a chart is cast for a national event then one can interpret the chart to determine influences surrounding the event. This is in contrast to a birth chart, which is calculated for the actual time of a person's birth, but the design and interpretation are similar.\n\n"}

(The recording did not include most of the music written by Gershwin which had been customarily cut from productions in the United States, however. As opposed to the complete three-hour opera, the album was two hours and nine minutes.)\n\nThe recording came about as a result of Lehman Engel and Goddard Lieberson's desire to record albums of Broadway shows whose scores had never been put on disc. Among the musicals the team had recorded (or would record) were \"Oh, Kay!\", \"Babes in Arms\", \"Girl Crazy\", and \"Pal Joey\".

It is the administrative center of Sahiwal District, and Sahiwal Division. It is the 21st largest city in Pakistan. Sahiwal is approximately 180 km from the major city Lahore and 100 km from Faisalabad and lies between Lahore and Multan.\n\nA small village on the Karachi-Lahore railway line during 1865 was named Montgomery after Sir Robert Montgomery, then Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab. Later, it was made the capital of the Montgomery District. Its name was reinstated as Sahiwal in 1966.\n\nThe city is in the densely populated region between the Sutlej and Ravi rivers. The principal crops are wheat, cotton, tobacco, legumes, potato and oil seeds. Cotton goods and lacquered woodwork are manufactured.\n\nThe Sahiwal District has been settled from the pre-historical era. Harappa is an archaeological site, about west of Sahiwal, that was built approximately 2600 BCE. The area was part of Indian empires and in crossroads of migrations and invasions from Central Asia. The pastoral tribes of this barren expanse did not appear to have paid more than a nominal allegiance to the Muslim rulers, the population for the most part remained in a chronic state of rebellion. Sahiwal is located close to Pakpattan, a famous medieval town and Muslim Sufi pilgrimage site. Pakpattan owes its sanctity and modern name, 'the holy ferry', to the shrine of the great Muslim Sufi Fariduddin Ganjshakar Shaikh-ul-Islam, Farid-ul-Hakkwa-ud-Din, Shakar Ganj (1173–1265) which was visited by old great traveler and historian Ibn Batuta in 1334. The native population converted to Islam by Sufi missionaries. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikh took control of Sahiwal. The inhabitants were treated benevolently during Sikh rule. The district came under direct British rule in 1849, when the district was officially formed with its headquarters at Pakpattan. The district was expanded to include the trans-Ravi portion in 1852, and the district headquarters were moved to Gogera. In 1865, when the railway was opened, a village on the railway side, was named \"Montgomery\" and became the capital of the district.\n\nDuring the Indian Rebellion of 1857, there was a general uprising of the Muslim population of Sahiwal, and the district formed the scene of the only uprising which took place north of Sutlej. Before the end of May 1857, emissaries from Delhi crossed the river from Sirsa and Hisar, where open rebellion was already ripe, and met with a ready reception from the Kharals and various other Muslim tribes. The district authorities, however, kept down the threatened uprising till August 26, 1857 when the prisoners in jail made a desperate attempt to break loose. At the same time Ahmad Khan, a famous Kharal leader, who had been detained at Gogera, broke his arrest, and though apprehended, was released on security, together with several other suspected chieftains. On September 16, they fled to their homes, and the whole country rose in open rebellion. Kot Kamalia was sacked; and Major Chamberlain, moving up with a small force from Multan, was besieged for some days at Chichawatni on the Ravi. The situation at the civil station remained critical till Colonel Paton arrived with substantial reinforcements from Lahore. An attack which took place immediately after their arrival was repulsed. Several minor actions followed in the open field, until finally the rebels, driven from the plain into the jungles of the interior, were utterly defeated and dispersed. The British troops then inflicted severe punishment on the insurgent clans, destroying their villages, and seizing large numbers of herds.\n\nThe district council authorised that the name be changed from Montgomery to Sahiwal in 1966. Sahiwal has an important new railway station.\n\nThe climate of Sahiwal district is extreme, reaching 34 °C in summer, and down to 4 °C in winter. The soil of the district is very fertile. The average rainfall is about 2000 mm.\n\nFollowing are some of notable educational institutes of the city:\n\nSahiwal is twinned with the town of Rochdale, in Greater Manchester, North West England. Approximately eight per cent of town's population is of Asian origin, most of whom have links with Pakistan. The twinning arrangement was agreed between Rochdale and Sahiwal in 1998. \n\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks (the former Paxson Communications). WZPX-TV's offices are located on Horizon Drive on the southeastern side of Grand Rapids, and its transmitter is located on South Norris Road in Orangeville Township.\n\nUntil 2019, the station's transmitter was located in Vermontville Township in western Eaton County (in the Lansing market).\n\nWZPX first signed on the air on October 11, 1996, as WJUE, carrying infomercials for most of the day as part of Paxson Communications' inTV service, along with programming from the United Paramount Network (UPN) as a secondary affiliation. The station's original licensee was Horizon Broadcasting Corporation, which Paxson Communications acquired before the station's sign-on. When Paxson bought WBSX-TV in Ann Arbor (now WPXD-TV), WJUE was spun off to DP Media, a sister company because of Federal Communications Commission ownership rules in effect at the time. WBSX's transmitter was located near Chelsea in northwestern Washtenaw County, which was close enough to the Ingham County line to give WBSX city-grade coverage of Lansing. Jackson, the second-largest city in the Lansing market, also got a fairly strong signal from WBSX. At the time, the FCC normally did not allow common ownership of stations with overlapping signals, and would not even consider granting a waiver for a city-grade overlap. Even though the two stations were in different markets, the FCC ruled that WJUE and WBSX were effectively a duopoly, forcing WJUE's sale. However, Paxson continued to operate the station under a local marketing agreement (LMA). Within a year, the station changed its call letters to WILV. \n\nOn August 31, 1998, the station became a charter affiliate of Pax TV, and changed its call letters to the current WZPX-TV. One year later on August 31, 1999, UPN programming moved to Grand Rapids-based WXSP-CA (channel 15). On October 6 of that year, WZPX became a secondary affiliate of The WB. UPN would later find an affiliate in Lansing on WHTV (channel 18) on October 16, 2000. During this time, the network's Detroit owned-and-operated station WKBD-TV was carried as an out-of-market signal on local cable providers. In 2000, when the FCC relaxed its ownership rules to allow ownership of stations with overlapping coverage, Paxson repurchased the station outright.\n\nAs UPN, WB and Pax TV all offered prime time programming on weekdays, WZPX had scheduling conflicts during its affiliations with the former two networks. It carried the Pax programs on the same days and times as other stations, programs from UPN delayed to 11 p.m. and midnight, respectively, and programs from The WB on a one-day delay, two hours before prime time. For example, WB primetime programs that aired on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. in other markets aired on Wednesdays at 6 p.m. on WZPX; promotional spots for these programs announced their local time slots. The station carried a brief announcement when switching between programs from the differing networks. The Disney's One Too/UPN Kids blocks ran on weekday mornings, while Kids' WB ran on weekday afternoons; the Kids' WB Saturday block still aired on Saturday mornings. The Pax programming bumped from the afternoon slot simply moved earlier in the day in place of infomercials that would normally air in that slot at the time. In part, because the station had the added draw of UPN and later WB programming, WZPX was at one point one of Pax TV's highest-rated affiliates.\n\nDespite the large signal overlap between WZPX and WPXD, Lansing-area cable providers opted to carry WZPX as the Ion Television station since its signal was broadcast closer from Orangeville Township, within the Lansing television market. WPXD has since moved its transmitter to a tower in Southfield; as a result, its signal no longer covers Lansing or Jackson.\n\nDue to the closure of The WB on September 17, 2006, WZPX became solely an Ion owned-and-operated station (The CW and MyNetworkTV chose to affiliate with subchannels of WWMT and WXSP-CD, respectively, allowing full prime time carriage of their schedules).\n\nWZPX-TV's digital signal on UHF channel 44 signed on November 1, 2008 (The Worship Network was removed from all Ion-owned stations, including WZPX, on February 1, 2010). The station shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 43, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 44, using PSIP to display WZPX-TV's virtual channel as 43 on digital television receivers.\n\n"}

She was born in Fort Riley, Kansas to a military family. Her first break came in 1968 when she auditioned for the chorus on \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\". In the next decade she became a sought-after backing singer, appearing on the Bobby Darin Show and touring with, among others Helen Reddy. She sang backing vocals on Donna Summer's album \"I Remember Yesterday\".\n\nIn the mid-1970s Brooks came to the attention of disco producer Simon Soussain, and her solo recording career was born. Her first of four albums on the Casablanca label was 1977's \"Love Shook\" (credited as \"Pattie Brooks & The Simon Orchestra\"), the album peaked at #2 on the US Dance Chart. Brooks remained with Soussain and in 1978 recorded her biggest club hit, \"After Dark\". It was selected to be part of the soundtrack to the film \"Thank God It's Friday,\" which topped the club play charts (#1 for six weeks). \n\n\"After Dark\" was the mainstay of Brooks's second album, \"Our Ms. Brooks\". The album also included the hit \"This Is The House Where Love Died\" and reached #22 on the US Dance Charts. \n\nIn 1979 Brooks moved away from Soussain with her third album, \"Party Girl\", produced by Bunny Sigler of Instant Funk and Salsoul fame. This album included a wider range of sounds – funk, pop, disco and ballads. While the album contained no major hits it did include \"Got Tu Go Disco\", the title song from the short-lived Broadway musical. The 12\" single peaked at No. 67 on the US Dance Charts. In 1979 Brooks branched out from disco by singing \"Close Enough For Love\", the title song to the Vanessa Redgrave movie \"Agatha\". By 1980, when a disco backlash had hit the industry in the US, Brooks's fourth and last Casablanca offering, \"Pattie Brooks\", was more of a pop-soul affair, produced this time by Michael Smith. No hits were forthcoming, and Brooks left Casablanca.\n\nShe returned in 1982 on the Mirage label with a fifth album, \"In My World\", produced by Sandy Linzer. The album reflected the popular styles of the time, and produced a moderate club hit with the dance-rock tinged \"Dr. Ruth\" and a minor R&B hit with the ballad \"Every Time I Turn Around\". The album was remastered and released as a compact disc on the Funky Town Grooves label in 2009. This turned out to be Brooks's last album, although she remained active in terms of one-off singles. In 1983 she was signed by Backstreet Records, releasing the minor club hit \"Get It On And Have A Party\". She was featured prominently on the soundtrack to the film \"Doctor Detroit\", including two duets with its star Dan Aykroyd.

In the case of a diatomic molecule (with one parameter, namely the bond length), this means that the eigenvalues cannot cross at all. In the case of a triatomic molecule, this means that the eigenvalues can coincide only at a single point (see conical intersection).\n\nThis is particularly important in quantum chemistry. In the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, the electronic molecular Hamiltonian is diagonalized on a set of distinct molecular geometries (the obtained eigenvalues are the values of the adiabatic potential energy surfaces). The geometries for which the potential energy surfaces are avoiding to cross are the locus where the Born–Oppenheimer approximation fails.\n\nStudy of a two-level system is of vital importance in quantum mechanics because it embodies simplification of many of physically realizable systems. The effect of perturbation on a two-state system Hamiltonian is manifested through avoided crossings in the plot of individual energy vs energy difference curve of the eigenstates. The two-state Hamiltonian can be written as\n\nThe eigenvalues of which are formula_2 and formula_3 and the eigenvectors, formula_4 and formula_5. These two eigenvectors designate the two states of the system. If the system is prepared in either of the states it would remain in that state. If formula_6 happens to be equal to formula_7 there will be a twofold degeneracy in the Hamiltonian. In that case any superposition of the degenerate eigenstates is evidently another eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. Hence the system prepared in any state will remain in that forever.\n\nHowever, when subjected to an external perturbation, the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian change. For the sake of simplicity we consider a perturbation with only off diagonal elements. Since the overall Hamiltonian must be Hermitian we may simply write the new Hamiltonian\n\nWhere P is the perturbation with zero diagonal terms. The fact that P is Hermitian fixes its off-diagonal components. The modified eigenstates can be found by diagonalising the modified Hamiltonian. It turns out that the new eigenvalues are,\n\nIf a graph is plotted varying formula_11 along the horizontal axis and formula_12 or formula_13 along the vertical, we find two branches of a hyperbola (as shown in the figure). The curve asymptotically approaches the original unperturbed energy levels. Analyzing the curves it becomes evident that even if the original states were degenerate (i.e. formula_14 ) the new energy states are no longer equal. However, if formula_15 is set to zero we may find at formula_16, formula_17 and the levels cross. Thus with the effect of the perturbation these level crossings are avoided.\n\nThe immediate impact of avoided level crossing in a degenerate two state system is the emergence of a lowered energy eigenstate. The effective lowering of energy always correspond to increasing stability.(see: Energy minimization) Bond resonance in organic molecules exemplifies the occurrence of such avoided crossings. To describe these cases we may note that the non-diagonal elements in an erstwhile diagonalised Hamiltonian not only modify the energy eigenvalues but also superpose the old eigenstates into the new ones. These effects are more prominent if the original Hamiltonian had degeneracy. This superposition of eigenstates to attain more stability is precisely the phenomena of chemical bond resonance.\n\nOur earlier treatment started by denoting the eigenvectors formula_4 and formula_5 as the matrix representation of eigenstates formula_20 and formula_21 of a two-state system. Using bra–ket notation the matrix elements of formula_22 are actually the terms\n\nwhere formula_25 due to the degeneracy of the unperturbed Hamiltonian and the off-diagonal perturbations are formula_26 and formula_27.\n\nThe new eigenstates formula_28 and formula_29 can be found by solving the eigenvalue equations formula_30 and formula_31. From simple calculations it can be shown that\n\nIt is evident that both of the new eigenstates are superposition of the original degenerate eigenstates and one of the eigenvalues (here formula_35) is less than the original unperturbed eigenenergy. So the corresponding stable system will naturally mix up the former unperturbed eigenstates to minimize its energy. In the example of Benzene the experimental evidences of probable bond structures give rise to two different eigenstates, formula_20 and formula_21. The symmetry of these two structures mandates that formula_38.\n\nHowever it turns out that the two-state Hamiltonian formula_39 of Benzene is not diagonal. The off-diagonal elements result into lowering of energy and the Benzene molecule stabilizes in a structure which is a superposition of these symmetric ones with energy formula_40.\nFor any general two-state system avoided level crossing repels the eigenstates formula_41 and formula_42 such that it requires more energy for the system to achieve the higher energy configuration.\n\nThe above illustration of avoided crossing however is a very specific case. From a generalised view point the phenomenon of avoided crossing is actually controlled by the parameters behind the perturbation. For the most general perturbation formula_43 affecting a two-dimensional subspace of the Hamiltonian formula_39, we may write the effective Hamiltonian matrix in that subspace as\nHere the elements of the state vectors were chosen to be real so that all the matrix elements become real.\nNow the eigenvalues of the system for this subspace are given by\nThe terms under the square root are squared real numbers. So for these two levels to cross we simultaneously require\nNow if the perturbation formula_49 has formula_50 parameters formula_51 we may in general vary these numbers to satisfy these two equations.\nIf we choose the values of formula_54 to formula_55 then both of the equations above have one single free parameter. In general it is not possible to find one formula_56 such that both of the equations are satisfied. However, if we allow another parameter to be free, both of these two equations will now be controlled by the same two parameters \nAnd generally there will be two such values of them for which the equations will be simultaneously satisfied. So with formula_50 distinct parameters formula_60 parameters can always be chosen arbitrarily and still we can find two such formula_56s such that there would be crossing of energy eigenvalues. In other words, the values of formula_62 and formula_63 would be the same for formula_60 freely varying co-ordinates (while the rest of the two co-ordinates are fixed from the condition equations). Geometrically the eigenvalue equations describe a surface in formula_50 dimensional space. \nSince their intersection is parametrized by formula_60 coordinates, we may formally state that for formula_50 continuous real parameters controlling the perturbed Hamiltonian, the levels (or surfaces) can only cross at a manifold of dimension formula_60. However the symmetry of the Hamiltonian has a role to play in the dimensionality. If the original Hamiltonian has asymmetric states, formula_70, the off-diagonal terms vanish automatically to ensure hermiticity. This allows us to get rid of the equation formula_71. Now from similar arguments as posed above, it is straightforward that for an asymmetrical Hamiltonian, the intersection of energy surfaces takes place in a manifold of dimension formula_72.\n\nIn polyatomic molecules, there are various parameters which determine the Hamiltonian of the system. The mutual distances between the atoms are one set of parameters. If both of the atoms of a diatomic molecule is same, the symmetry suggests that different configurations keeping their mutual distance fixed will result into same electronic states. So it is the relative distance formula_73 which acts as a parameter for the two equations promising level crossing. Hence due to the avoided crossing theorem in general we can not have level crossings between two electronic states of same symmetry. But in polyatomic molecules the number of independent mutual distances of nuclei are more. For a N-atomic molecule the number of independent mutual separation is formula_74 (for formula_75). Each of them acts as a parameter for the total Hamiltonian. Since we always have minimum of three independent parameters, level crossing is not totally avoided in these molecules.\n\n"}

Computers can perform these calculations at a rate of millions per second, and thousands of computers can be harnessed together in a distributed computing network. But the number of computations required on average grows exponentially with the size of the key, and for many problems standard computers are not fast enough. On the other hand, many cryptographic algorithms lend themselves to fast implementation in hardware, i.e. networks of logic circuits, also known as gates. Integrated circuits (ICs) are constructed of these gates and often can execute cryptographic algorithms hundreds of times faster than a general purpose computer. \n\nEach IC can contain large numbers of gates (hundreds of millions in 2005). Thus the same decryption circuit, or cell, can be replicated thousands of times on one IC. The communications requirements for these ICs are very simple. Each must be initially loaded with a starting point in the key space and, in some situations, with a comparison test value (see known plaintext attack). Output consists of a signal that the IC has found an answer and the successful key.\n\nSince ICs lend themselves to mass production, thousands or even millions of ICs can be applied to a single problem. The ICs themselves can be mounted in printed circuit boards. A standard board design can be used for different problems since the communication requirements for the chips are the same. Wafer-scale integration is another possibility. The primary limitations on this method are the cost of chip design, IC fabrication, floor space, electric power and thermal dissipation.\n\nAn alternative approach is to use FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays); these are slower and more expensive per gate, but can be reprogrammed for different problems. COPACOBANA (Cost-Optimized Parallel COde Breaker) is one such machine, consisting of 120 FPGAs of type Xilinx Spartan3-1000 which run in parallel.\n\nThe earliest custom hardware attack may have been the Bombe used to recover Enigma machine keys in World War II. In 1998, a custom hardware attack was mounted against the Data Encryption Standard cipher by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Their \"Deep Crack\" machine cost U.S. $250,000 to build and decrypted the DES Challenge II-2 test message after 56 hours of work. The only other confirmed DES cracker was the COPACOBANA machine (Cost-Optimized PArallel COde Breaker) built in 2006. Unlike Deep Crack, COPACOBANA consist of commercially available, reconfigurable integrated circuits. COPACOBANA costs about $10,000 to build and will recover a DES key in under 6.4 days on average. The cost decrease by roughly a factor of 25 over the EFF machine is an impressive example for the continuous improvement of digital hardware. Adjusting for inflation over 8 years yields an even higher improvement of about 30x. Since 2007, SciEngines GmbH, a spin-off company of the two project partners of COPACOBANA has enhanced and developed successors of COPACOBANA. In 2008 their COPACOBANA RIVYERA reduced the time to break DES to the current record of less than one day, using 128 Spartan-3 5000's. It is generally believed that large government code breaking organizations, such as the U.S. National Security Agency, make extensive use of custom hardware attacks, but no examples have been \ndeclassified .\n\n\n"}

These small moths are leaf-miners in the caterpillar stage, feeding mainly on Fagaceae (\"Tischeria\" and \"Coptotriche\"), Asteraceae, and Malvaceae (\"Astrotischeria\"), and some also on Rhamnaceae, Tiliaceae, and Rosaceae.\n\n\n\n"}

Those musicians included Skip McDonald and Doug Wimbish who were among the musicians later responsible for much of the backing work at \"Sugar Hill Records\" before teaming up to become known as Tackhead in the 1980s, collaborating with Adrian Sherwood on numerous works on his label \"ON-U Sound\" in England.\n\nDue to the overtly sexual lyrics of \"In the Bush\" many radio stations banned it when it was released during 1978. Because of limited airplay it only scored No. 58 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and No. 21 on the Black Singles Chart, although it did top the Hot Dance Club Play chart along with the second single \"Keep on Jumpin'\". It also reached No. 16 on the UK Singles Chart in December 1978.Their second big hit, \"Keep on Jumpin'\" was another club success peaking at No. 1 on the Disco and Hot Dance Club Play chart. The song crossed over to the urban market and peaked at No. 81 on the Black Singles chart. Musique's debut album peaked at No. 62 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. The vocalists on the first LP \"Keep on Jumpin' \" were a pre-solo career Jocelyn Brown, Angela Howell, Gina Tharps and Christine Wiltshire. On the second LP \"Musique II\", released in 1979, Mary Seymour, Denise Edwards and Gina Taylor took the lead vocals. Both albums were released on the Prelude Records label. \"Love Massage\" became another successful club hit, but failed to crossover to either the R&B or pop markets.\n\nMusique broke up by the early 1980s. Adams continued to be an in-demand record producer.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2174079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174079", "title": "Chen–Ho encoding", "text": "Chen–Ho encoding\n\nChen–Ho encoding is a memory-efficient alternate system of binary encoding for decimal digits.\n\nThe traditional system of binary encoding for decimal digits, known as binary-coded decimal (BCD), uses four bits to encode each digit, resulting in significant wastage of binary data bandwidth (since four bits can store 16 states and are being used to store only 10).\n\nThe encoding reduces the storage requirements of two decimal digits (100 states) from 8 to 7 bits, and those of three decimal digits (1000 states) from 12 to 10 bits using only simple Boolean transformations avoiding any complex arithmetic operations like a base conversion.\n\nIn what appears to have been a multiple discovery, some of the concepts behind what later became known as Chen–Ho encoding were independently developed by Theodore M. Hertz in 1969 and by Tien Chi Chen in 1971.\n\nHertz of Rockwell filed a patent for his encoding in 1969, which was granted in 1971.\n\nChen first discussed his ideas with Irving Tze Ho in 1971. Chen and Ho were both working for IBM at the time, although in different locations. Chen also consulted with Frank C. Tung to verify the results of his theories independently. IBM filed a patent in their name in 1973, which was granted in 1974. At least by 1973 Hertz's earlier work must have been known to them, as the patent cites his patent as prior art.\n\nThe final version of the Chen–Ho encoding was circulated inside IBM in 1974 and published in 1975 in the journal \"Communications of the ACM\". This version included several refinements, primarily related to the application of the encoding system. It constitutes a Huffman-like prefix code.\n\nThe encoding became known as \"Chen–Ho encoding\" or \"Chen–Ho algorithm\" only since 2000. After having filed a patent in 2001, Michael F. Cowlishaw published a further refinement of Chen–Ho encoding known as Densely Packed Decimal (DPD) encoding in \"IEE Proceedings - Computers and Digital Techniques\" in 2002. Densely Packed Decimal has subsequently been adopted as the \"decimal encoding\" used in the IEEE 754-2008 and floating-point standards.\n\nChen noted that the digits zero through seven were simply encoded using three binary digits of the corresponding octal group. He also postulated that one could use a flag to identify a different encoding for the digits eight and nine, which would be encoded using a single bit.\n\nIn practice, a series of Boolean transformations are applied to the stream of input bits, compressing BCD encoded digits from 12 bits per three digits to 10 bits per three digits. Reversed transformations are used to decode the resulting coded stream to BCD. Equivalent results can also be achieved by the use of a look-up table.\n\nChen–Ho encoding is limited to encoding sets of three decimal digits into groups of 10 bits (so called \"declets\"). Of the 1024 states possible by using 10 bits, it leaves only 24 states unused (with don't care bits typically set to 0 on write and ignored on read). With only 0.34% wastage it gives a 20% more efficient encoding than BCD with one digit in 4 bits.\n\nBoth Hertz and Chen also proposed similar, but less efficient, encoding schemes to compress sets of two decimal digits (requiring 8 bits in BCD) into groups of 7 bits.\n\nLarger sets of decimal digits could by divided into three- and two-digit groups.\n\nThe patents also discuss the possibility to adapt the scheme to digits encoded in any other decimal codes than BCD, like f.e. Excess-3. The same principles could also be applied to other bases.\n\nIn 1973, some form of Chen–Ho encoding appears to have been utilized in the address conversion hardware of the optional IBM 7070/7074 emulation feature for the IBM System/370 Model 165 and 370 Model 168 computers.\n\nOne prominent application uses a 128-bit register to store 33 decimal digits with a three digit exponent, effectively not less than what could be achieved using binary encoding (whereas BCD encoding would need 144 bits to store the same number of digits).\n\n\n"}

Though Christine had a long career as a character actress in film and television, she is probably best remembered as \"Mrs. Olson\" (or the \"Folgers Coffee Woman\") in a number of television commercials for Folgers Coffee during the 1960s and '70s.\n\nChristine was born Virginia Christine Ricketts in Stanton in Montgomery County in southwestern Iowa. She was of Swedish descent. Upon her mother's remarriage, she changed her last name to \"Kraft\". The family later moved to Des Moines in Polk County, where Virginia attended Elmwood Elementary School. The family relocated again to Des Moines County in southeastern Iowa, not to be confused with the state capital in central Iowa. There Christine attended Mediapolis High School, where she aspired to be a concert pianist. Her family later moved to California, where she enrolled at UCLA.\n\nChristine began working in radio during college. She began training for a theatrical career with actor/director Fritz Feld whom she married in 1940. In 1942, she made her stage debut in the Los Angeles production of \"Hedda Gabler\". While performing in the play, she was spotted by an agent from Warner Bros. who signed her to a film contract with the studio. Her first film for Warner's was \"Edge of Darkness\" (1943), in which she played a Norwegian peasant girl. She was dropped by Warner Bros. in 1943 and signed with Universal Pictures in 1944. That year, Christine had a supporting role in \"The Mummy's Curse\" and \"The Wife of Monte Cristo\", with her husband Fritz Feld (the two would also go on to appear together in the Western \"4 for Texas\" in 1963). In 1946, she appeared in \"The Scarlet Horseman\", a 13-chapter film serial playing Carla Marquette, or Matosca, followed by a supporting role in mystery film \"The Inner Circle\". Christine's next film for Universal was the film noir classic \"The Killers\". She initially tested for the lead role of femme fatale Kitty Collins, but lost out to Ava Gardner. The film's producer, Mark Hellinger, was impressed with her test and cast her as Lilly Harmon Lubinsky, the wife of Lt. Sam Lubinsky (Sam Levene). Christine also portrayed the role of Miss Watston in the 1964 remake of the film, starring Lee Marvin and Angie Dickinson.\n\nIn 1950, she played an uncredited, supporting role in \"The Men\". Although the part was small and the film was not a commercial success, her performance impressed the film's producer Stanley Kramer. She became a favorite of his and went on to appear in a number of his films including \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" (1950) and \"High Noon\" (1952). Kramer later cast her in the 1955 drama \"Not as a Stranger\", where she played a countrywoman. She also coached the film's star Olivia de Havilland on her Swedish accent. The following year, she co-starred in the horror film \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\". In 1961, Kramer cast her again as a German housekeeper in \"Judgment at Nuremberg\". One of her most notable roles was as Hilary St. George, the bigoted co-worker of the Katharine Hepburn character in the 1967 film \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\".\n\nIn addition to her work in films, Christine also appeared in numerous television series. In the 1950s, she appeared in multiple guest roles on \"The Abbott and Costello Show\", \"Four Star Playhouse\", \"Dragnet\", \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", \"The Ford Television Theatre\", \"Gunsmoke\", \"Science Fiction Theatre\", \"Matinee Theatre\", \"Father Knows Best\", \"Trackdown\", \"State Trooper\", \"\", \"The Rifleman\", \"Letter to Loretta\" ,\"Superman\", and \"General Electric Theater\". In November 1959, Christine co-starred as the wife of a verbally abusive hypochondriac in the first-season episode of \"The Twilight Zone\" entitled \"Escape Clause\".\n\nIn 1960 and 1961, Christine guest starred on episodes of \"Coronado 9\", \"Rawhide\", and \"The Untouchables\". From 1961 to 1962, Christine had a recurring role as widow Ovie Swenson in the Western series \"Tales of Wells Fargo\". She made four guest appearances on \"Perry Mason\", including the role of defendant Beth Sandover in the season 6, 1962 episode, \"The Case of the Double-Entry Mind,\" and murderer Edith Summers in the season 7, 1963 episode, \"The Case of the Devious Delinquent.\" For the remainder of the decade, she continued with guest starring roles in show such as \"77 Sunset Strip\", \"Ben Casey\", \"Bonanza\", \"The Fugitive\", \"Hazel\", \"Wagon Train\", \"The Virginian\", \"Going My Way\", \"The F.B.I.\", and \"Daniel Boone\". In 1969, Christine co-starred in the ABC television movie \"Daughter of the Mind\".\n\nHer greatest fame came in 1965 when she started her 21-year stint as the matronly Mrs. Olson, who had comforting words for young married couples while pouring Folgers Coffee in the television commercials. The commercials became a popular staple on television and Christine's character, Mrs. Olson, was often parodied by comedians and entertainers including Carol Burnett, Johnny Carson, Bob Hope, Ann-Margret, and Jackie Gleason. She would go on to appear in over 100 commercials for Folgers. In 1971, Christine's hometown of Stanton, Iowa, honored her by transforming the city water tower to resemble a giant coffeepot.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Christine continued to work primarily in television. Her last role was on the 1979 animated series \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\", in which she provided additional voices.\n\nChristine retired from acting in 1979. After her retirement, she did volunteer work at Planned Parenthood and served as a judge at the American College Theatre Festival. Christine was later appointed the honorary mayor of Brentwood, Los Angeles where she and her husband resided for many years.\n\nIn November 1940, Christine married character actor Fritz Feld. The couple had two sons, Steven and Danny. Christine and Feld remained married until Feld's death in 1993.\n\nOn July 24, 1996, Christine died at her Brentwood home of cardiovascular disease. Her interment was at the Jewish Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in the Hollywood Hills section of Los Angeles.\n\n"}

Substation automation refers to using data from Intelligent electronic devices (IED), control and automation capabilities within the substation, and control commands from remote users to control power-system devices.\n\nSince full substation automation relies on substation integration, the terms are often used interchangeably. Power-system automation includes processes associated with generation and delivery of power. Monitoring and control of power delivery systems in the substation and on the pole reduce the occurrence of outages and shorten the duration of outages that do occur. The IEDs, communications protocols, and communications methods, work together as a system to perform power-system automation.\nThe term “power system” describes the collection of devices that make up the physical systems that generate, transmit, and distribute power. The term “instrumentation and control (I&C) system” refers to the collection of devices that monitor, control, and protect the power system.\n\nPower-system automation is composed of several tasks. \nIn addition, another task is power-system integration, which is the act of communicating data to, from, or among IEDs in the I&C system and remote users. Substation integration refers to combining data from the IED's local to a substation so that there is a single point of contact in the substation for all of the I&C data.\n\nPower-system automation processes rely on data acquisition; power-system supervision and power-system control all working together in a coordinated automatic fashion. The commands are generated automatically and then transmitted in the same fashion as operator initiated commands.\n\nThe instrument transformers with protective relays are used to sense the power-system voltage and current. They are physically connected to power-system apparatus and convert the actual power-system signals. The transducers convert the analog output of an instrument transformer from one magnitude to another or from one value type to another, such as from an ac current to dc voltage. Also the input data is taken from the auxiliary contacts of switch gears and power-system control equipment.\n\nThe I&C devices built using microprocessors are commonly referred to as intelligent electronic devices (IEDs). Microprocessors are single chip computers that allow the devices into which they are built to process data, accept commands, and communicate information like a computer. Automatic processes can be run in the IEDs. Some IEDs used in power-system automation are:\n\n\n\nAll lines and all electrical equipment must be protected against prolonged overcurrent. If the cause of the overcurrent is nearby then automatically that current is interrupted immediately. But if the cause of the overcurrent is outside the local area then a backup provision automatically disconnects all affected circuits after a suitable time delay.\n\nNote that disconnection can, unfortunately, have a cascade effect, leading to overcurrent in other circuits that then also must therefore disconnect automatically.\n\nAlso note that generators that suddenly have lost their load because of such a protection operation will have to shut down automatically immediately, and it may take many hours to restore a proper balance between demand and supply in the system, partly because there must be proper synchronization before any two parts of the system can be reconnected.\n\nReclosing operations of circuit breakers usually are attempted automatically, and often are successful during thunderstorms, for example.\n\nA \"supervisory control and data acquisition system\" (SCADA) transmits and receives logic or data from events of controls, metering, measuring, safety and monitoring of process devices such as Electrical equipment, Instrumentation devices, telecommunication on industrial applications. Power system elements ranging from pole-mounted switches to entire power plants can be controlled remotely over long distance communication links. Remote switching, telemetering of grids (showing voltage, current, power, direction, consumption in kWh, etc.), even automatic synchronization is used in some power systems.\n\nPower utility companies protect high voltage lines by monitoring them constantly. This supervision requires the transmission of information between the power substations in order to ensure correct operation while controlling every alarm and failure. Legacy telecom networks were interconnected with metallic wires, but the substation environment is characterized by a high level of electromagnetic fields that may disturb copper wires.\n\nAuthorities use a tele-protection scheme to enable substations to communicate with one another to selectively isolate faults on high voltage lines, transformers, reactors and other important elements of the electrical plants. This functionality requires the continuous exchange of critical data in order to assure correct operation. In order to warranty the operation the telecom network should always be in perfect conditions in terms of availability, performance, quality and delays.\n\nInitially these networks were made of metallic conductive media, however the vulnerability of the 56–64 kbit/s channels to electromagnetic interference, signal ground loops, and ground potential rise made them too unreliable for the power industry. Strong electromagnetic fields caused by the high voltages and currents in power lines occur regularly in electric substations.\n\nMoreover, during fault conditions electromagnetic perturbations may rise significantly and disturb those communications channels based on copper wires. The reliability of the communications link interconnecting the protection relays is critical and therefore must be resistant to effects encountered in high voltage areas, such as high frequency induction and ground potential rise.\n\nConsequently, the power industry moved to optical fibers to interconnect the different items installed in substations. Fiber optics need not be grounded and are immune to the interferences caused by electrical noise, eliminating many of the errors commonly seen with electrical connections. The use of fully optical links from power relays to multiplexers as described by IEEE C37.94 became standard.\n\nA more sophisticated architecture for the protection scheme emphasizes the notion of fault tolerant networks. Instead of using a direct relay connection and dedicated fibers, redundant connections make the protection process more reliable by increasing the availability of critical data interchanges.\n\nIEEE C37.94 , full title \"IEEE Standard for N Times 64 Kilobit Per Second Optical Fiber Interfaces Between Teleprotection and Multiplexer Equipment\", is an IEEE standard, published in 2002, that defines the rules to interconnect tele-protection and multiplexer devices of power utility companies. The standard defines a data frame format for optical interconnection, and references standards for the physical connector for multi-mode optical fiber. Furthermore, it defines behavior of connected equipment on failure of the link, and the timing and optical signal characteristics.\n\nTeleprotection systems must isolate faults very quickly to prevent damage to the network and power outages. The IEEE committee defined C37.94 as a programmable n x 64 kbit/s (n=1...12) multimode optical fiber interface to provide transparent communications between teleprotection relays and multiplexers for distances of up to 2 km. To reach longer distances, the power industry later adopted a single mode optical fiber interface as well.\n\nThe standard defines the protection and communications equipment inside a substation using optical fibers, the method for clock recovery, the jitter tolerances allowed in the signals, the physical connection method, and the actions the protection equipment must follow when any kind of network anomalies and faults occur. C37.94 was already implemented by many protection relay manufacturers such as ABB, SEL, RFL, and RAD; and tester manufacturers such as ALBEDO and VEEX. Teleprotection equipment once offered a choice of transmission interfaces, such as the IEEE C37.94 compliant optical fiber interface for transmission over fiber pairs, and G.703, 64kbit/s co-directional and E1 interfaces.\n\n"}
